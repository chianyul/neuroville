BRAVO Study Grp	A randomized placebo-controlled phase III trial of oral laquinimod for multiple sclerosis	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Laquinimod; Multiple sclerosis; Disability; EDSS; Interferon beta-1a	CLINICAL-TRIALS; GLATIRAMER; THERAPIES; DISEASES; ATROPHY; BG-12; BRAIN; MS	The phase III placebo-controlled BRAVO study assessed laquinimod effects in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and descriptively compared laquinimod with interferon beta (IFN beta)-1a (Avonex(A (R)) reference arm). RRMS patients age 18-55 years with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of 0-5.5 and documented pre-study relapse (a parts per thousand yen 1 in previous year, 2 in previous 2 years, or 1 in previous 1-2 years and a parts per thousand yen 1 GdE lesion in the previous year) were randomized (1:1:1) to laquinimod 0.6 mg once-daily, matching oral placebo, or IFN beta-1a IM 30 mu g once-weekly (rater-blinded design), for 24 months. The primary endpoint was annualized relapse rate (ARR); secondary endpoints included percent brain volume change (PBVC) and 3-month confirmed disability worsening. In all, 1,331 patients were randomized: laquinimod (n = 434), placebo (n = 450), and IFN beta-1a (n = 447). ARR was not significantly reduced with laquinimod [-18 %, risk ratio (RR) = 0.82, 95 % CI 0.66-1.02; p = 0.075] vs. placebo. Laquinimod significantly reduced PBVC (28 %, p < 0.001). Confirmed disability worsening was infrequent (10 % laquinimod, 13 % placebo). The change in confirmed disability worsening with laquinimod measured using EDSS was -31 % [hazard ratio (HR) 0.69, p = 0.063], and using Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) z-score was -77 % (p = 0.150), vs. placebo. IFN beta-1a reduced ARR 26 % (RR = 0.74, 95 % CI 0.60-0.92, p = 0.007), showed no effect on PBVC loss (+11 %, p = 0.14), and changes in disability worsening were -26 and -66 % as measured using the EDSS (HR 0.742, p = 0.13) and MSFC (p = 0.208), respectively. Adverse events occurred in 75, 82, and 70 % of laquinimod, IFN beta-1a, and placebo patients, respectively. Once-daily oral laquinimod 0.6 mg resulted in statistically nonsignificant reductions in ARR and disability progression, but significant reductions in brain atrophy vs. placebo. Laquinimod was well-tolerated.	[Vollmer, T. L.] Univ Colorado, Dept Neurol, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Vollmer, T.

Interpreting therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis via MRI contrast enhancing lesions: now you see them, now you don't	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Permeability; DCE-MRI; Lesion enhancement; Limit of detection; Therapy; Time-course	BRAIN-BARRIER PERMEABILITY; GLATIRAMER ACETATE; CLINICAL-TRIALS; MS; SENSITIVITY; SURROGATE; RELAPSES; MULTICENTER; DISABILITY; STANDARD	Gadolinium (Gd) enhancement of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions on MRI scans is a commonly used outcome measure in therapeutic trials. However, enhancement depends on MRI acquisition parameters that might significantly alter detectability. We investigated how the difference in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability threshold between MRI protocols affects lesion detection and apparent enhancement time using dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. We examined fourty-four relapsing-remitting MS patients with two MRI protocols: 'standard sensitivity' (SS) (1.5 T, single-dose Gd) and 'high sensitivity' (HS) (3 T, triple-dose Gd, delayed acquisition). Eleven patients had at least one enhancing lesion and completed the 1-month follow-up. We acquired DCE-MRI during the HS protocol and calculated BBB permeability. Sixty-five lesions were enhanced with the SS vs. 135 with the HS protocol. The detection threshold of the HS was significantly lower than that of the SS protocol (K (trans) = 2.64 vs. 4.00E-3 min(-1), p < 0.01). Most lesions (74 %) were in the recovery phase; none were in the onset phase and 26 % were at the peak of enhancement. The estimated duration of detectability with the HS protocol was significantly longer than for the SS protocol (6-12 weeks vs. 3 weeks). Our observations on the protocol-dependent threshold for detection and time-course help explain discrepancies in the observed effects of anti-inflammatory therapies on MS lesions.

Neuronal detection thresholds during vestibular compensation: contributions of response variability and sensory substitution	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; ALERT SQUIRREL-MONKEY; MOVEMENT RELATED NEURONS; BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; UNILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY; MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; EYE-MOVEMENT; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; FIRING BEHAVIOR; DISCRIMINATION THRESHOLDS	Key points Unilateral vestibular injury impairs our ability to detect motion. However, before this study the neural mechanisms underlying this impairment had not yet been established. We found that the detection thresholds of neurons at the first central stage of vestibular processing (i.e. vestibular nuclei) dramatically increase immediately post-lesion, and despite some recovery remain elevated even after 1 month, following the trend reported for vestibular patients' perception. After the lesion, parallel changes in neuronal trial-to-trial variability and sensitivity account for consistently elevated thresholds, thus providing a neural correlate for impaired behavioural performance. In a subset of neurons, sensory substitution with extravestibular (i.e. proprioceptive) inputs after the lesion combined with residual vestibular information serves to improve neuronal detection thresholds for head-on-body motion. Our results provide a neural correlate for rehabilitation approaches that take advantage of the convergence of proprioceptive and vestibular inputs to improve patient outcomes. The vestibular system is responsible for processing self-motion, allowing normal subjects to discriminate the direction of rotational movements as slow as 1-2degs(-1). After unilateral vestibular injury patients' direction-discrimination thresholds worsen to similar to 20degs(-1), and despite some improvement thresholds remain substantially elevated following compensation. To date, however, the underlying neural mechanisms of this recovery have not been addressed. Here, we recorded from first-order central neurons in the macaque monkey that provide vestibular information to higher brain areas for self-motion perception. Immediately following unilateral labyrinthectomy, neuronal detection thresholds increased by more than two-fold (from 14 to 30degs(-1)). While thresholds showed slight improvement by week 3 (25degs(-1)), they never recovered to control values - a trend mirroring the time course of perceptual thresholds in patients. We further discovered that changes in neuronal response variability paralleled changes in sensitivity for vestibular stimulation during compensation, thereby causing detection thresholds to remain elevated over time. However, we found that in a subset of neurons, the emergence of neck proprioceptive responses combined with residual vestibular modulation during head-on-body motion led to better neuronal detection thresholds. Taken together, our results emphasize that increases in response variability to vestibular inputs ultimately constrain neural thresholds and provide evidence that sensory substitution with extravestibular (i.e. proprioceptive) inputs at the first central stage of vestibular processing is a neural substrate for improvements in self-motion perception following vestibular loss. Thus, our results provide a neural correlate for the patient benefits provided by rehabilitative strategies that take advantage of the convergence of these multisensory cues.

Vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600) mutated metastatic melanoma: an open-label, multicentre, safety study	LANCET ONCOLOGY			English	Article							MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; BRAIN METASTASES; SURVIVAL; PROGRESSION	Background The orally available BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib, compared with dacarbazine, shows improved response rates, progression- free survival (PFS), and overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma that has a BRAF(V600) mutation. We assessed vemurafenib in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma with BRAF(V600) mutations who had few treatment options. Methods In an open-label, multicentre study, patients with untreated or previously treated melanoma and a BRAF(V600) mutation received oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day. The primary endpoint was safety. All analyses were done on the safety population, which included all patients who received at least one dose of vemurafenib. This report is the third interim analysis of this study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01307397. Findings Between March 1, 2011, and Jan 31, 2013, 3226 patients were enrolled in 44 countries. 3222 patients received at least one dose of vemurafenib (safety population). At data cutoff, 868 (27%) patients were on study treatment and 2354 (73%) had withdrawn, mainly because of disease progression. Common adverse events of all grades included rash (1592 [49%]), arthralgia (1259 [39%]), fatigue (1093 [34%]), photosensitivity reaction (994 [31%]), alopecia (826 [26%]), and nausea (628 [19%]). 1480 (46%) patients reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (389 [12%]), rash (155 [5%]), liver function abnormalities (165 [5%]), arthralgia (106 [3%]), and fatigue (93 [3%]). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were reported more frequently in patients aged 75 years and older (n= 257; 152 [59%, 95% CI 53- 65] and ten [4%, 2- 7], respectively) than in those younger than 75 years (n= 2965; 1286 [43%, 42- 45] and 82 [3%, 2- 3], respectively). Interpretation Vemurafenib safety in this diverse population of patients with BRAF(V600) mutated metastatic melanoma, who are more representative of routine clinical practice, was consistent with the safety profile shown in the pivotal trials of this drug.

The burden of IDD, in terms of emotional suffering and associated health care costs, is significant; prevention and treatment therefore are important A systematic literature review, updated in 2013, identified 89 inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), which present with IDD as prominent feature and are amenable to causal therapy. Therapeutic effects include improvement and/or stabilization of psychomotor/ cognitive development, behavior/psychiatric disturbances, seizures, neurologic and systemic manifestations. The levels of available evidence for the various treatments range from Level 1b, c (n = 5); Level 2a, b, c (n = 14); Level 4 (n = 53), and Levels 4-5 (n = 27). For a target audience comprising clinical and biochemical geneticists, child neurologists and developmental pediatricians, five experts translated....this data into a 2-tiered diagnostic algorithm: The first tier comprises metabolic "screening" tests in urine and blood, which are relatively accessible, affordable, less invasive, and have the potential to identify 60% of all treatable IEMs. The second tier investigations for the remaining disorders are ordered based on individual clinical signs and symptoms. This algorithm is supported by an App www.treatable-id.org, which comprises up-to-date information on all 89 IEMs, relevant diagnostic tests, therapies and a search function based on signs and symptoms. These recommendations support the clinician in early identification of treatable IEMs in the child with IDD, allowing for timely initiation of therapy with the potential to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes. The need for future studies to determine yield and usefulness of these recommendations, with subsequent updates and improvements to developments in the field, is outlined. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Methods: We report 5 year follow-up data on 362 subjects for a composite endpoint (death, neurologic or cardiovascular events, development of end-stage renal disease or sustained increase in serum creatinine of 50% from baseline). Results: At enrollment, 86 subjects had previously received ERT (Cohort la) and 67 subjects were newly started (Cohort 1b) and randomized to agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta. 209 subjects did not initially meet ERT criteria (Cohort 1c), 25 of whom met ERT criteria in follow-up and were moved to Cohort 1b (total N=178 ERT treated subjects). Use of supportive therapies such as aspirin (78%), renin-angiotensin blockade (59%), and statins (55%) was common in ERT treated subjects. In Cohort la, 32 subjects met the composite endpoint with 8 deaths. In Cohort 1b, 16 subjects met the composite endpoint with 1 death. Cohort 1b had fewer clinical events than Cohort 1a (p=0.039) suggesting that the treatment protocol was effective in targeting subjects at an earlier stage. 19.4% of Cohort 1b subjects on agalsidase alfa and 13.3% on agalsidase beta had a clinical event (p=0.57). 10 Cohort 1c subjects had clinical events, none of which would have been prevented by earlier use of ERT. Conclusions: Cardiovascular risk factor modification and targeted use of ERT reduce the risk of adverse outcomes related to Fabry disease. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Sirrs, S.

These autosomal recessive disorders impact brain development and also cause postnatal liver, adrenal, and kidney dysfunction, as well as loss of vision and hearing. The hypomorphic PEX1-G843D missense allele, observed in approximately 30% of ZSD patients, is associated with milder clinical and biochemical phenotypes, with some homozygous individuals surviving into early adulthood. Nonetheless, affected children with the PEX1-G843D allele have intellectual disability, failure to thrive, and significant sensory deficits. To enhance our ability to test candidate therapies that improve human PEX1-G843D function, we created the novel Pex1-G844D knock-in mouse model that represents the murine equivalent of the common human mutation. We show that Pex1-G844D homozygous mice recapitulate many classic features of mild ZSD cases, including growth retardation and fatty livers with cholestasis. In addition, electrophysiology, histology, and gene expression studies provide evidence that these animals develop a retinopathy similar to that observed in human patients, with evidence of cone photoreceptor cell death. Similar to skin fibroblasts obtained from ZSD patients with a PEX1-G843D allele, we demonstrate that murine cells homozygous for the Pex1-G844D allele respond to chaperone-like compounds, which normalizes peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Thus, the Pex1-G844D mouse provides a powerful model system for testing candidate therapies that address the most common genetic cause of ZSD. In addition, this murine model will enhance studies focused on mechanisms of pathogenesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Eighteen cynomolgus monkeys-6 young (4-9 years), 6 middle-aged (10-19 years), and 6 old (above 20 years)-were tested. In general, the old monkeys scored significantly worse than did the animals in the two other age groups. Longer delays between stimulus presentation and response increased the performance differences between the old and younger monkeys. The old monkeys in particular showed signs of impaired visuospatial memory and deteriorated memory consolidation and executive functioning. These results add to the body of evidence supporting the utility of Macaca fascicularis in studies of cognition and as a potential translational model for age-associated memory impairment/dementia-related disorders.

Despite decades of research, there is currently no pharmacologically effective treatment for preventing neuronal loss and repairing the brain. As a result, novel therapeutic approaches, such as cell-based therapies, are being actively pursued to repair tissue damage and restore neurological function after injury. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective potential of amniotic fluid (AF) single cell clones, engineered to secrete glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (AF-GDNF), both in vitro and in a surgically induced model of brain injury. Our results show that pre-treatment with GDNF significantly increases cell survival in cultures of AF cells or cortical neurons exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Since improving the efficacy of cell transplantation depends on enhanced graft cell survival, we investigated whether AF-GDNF cells seeded on polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffolds could enhance graft survival following implantation into the lesion cavity. Encouragingly, the AF-GDNF cells survived longer than control AF cells in serum-free conditions and continued to secrete GDNF both in vitro and following implantation into the injured motor cortex. AF-GDNF implantation in the acute period following injury was sufficient to activate the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in host neural cells in the peri-lesion area, potentially boosting endogenous neuroprotective pathways. These results were complemented with promising trends in beam walk tasks in AF-GDNF/PGA animals during the 7 day timeframe. Further investigation is required to determine whether significant behavioural improvement can be achieved at a longer timeframe.

We presented spatial frequency filtered letters to neurologically intact non-dyslexic readers while manipulating target-flanker distance, target eccentricity and target-flanker confusability (letter similarity metric based on published letter confusion matrices). The results show that high target-flanker confusability magnifies crowding. They also reveal an intricate pattern of interactions of the spatial frequency content of the stimuli with target eccentricity, flanker distance and similarity. The findings are congruent with the notion that crowding results from the inappropriate pooling of target and flanker features and that this integration is more likely to match a response template at a subsequent decision stage with similar than dissimilar flankers. In addition, the evidence suggests that crowding from similar flankers is biased towards relatively high spatial frequencies and that crowding shifts towards lower spatial frequencies as target eccentricity is increased.

EP binds to the elastin receptor complex (ERC) at the cell surface, composed of elastin-binding protein (EBP), a cathepsin A and a neuraminidase 1. Some in vitro functions have clearly been attributed to this binding, but the in vivo implications for arterial diseases have never been clearly investigated. Methods and results Here, we demonstrate that chronic doses of EP injected into mouse models of atherosclerosis increase atherosclerotic plaque size formation. Similar effects were observed following an injection of a VGVAPG peptide, suggesting that the ERC mediates these effects. The absence of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3K gamma) in bone marrow-derived cells prevented EP-induced atherosclerosis development, demonstrating that PI3K gamma drive EP-induced arterial lesions. Accordingly, in vitro studies showed that PI3K gamma was required for EP-induced monocyte migration and ROS production and that this effect was dependent upon neuraminidase activity. Finally, we showed that degradation of elastic lamellae in LDLR-/- mice fed an atherogenic diet correlated with atherosclerotic plaque formation. At the same time, the absence of the cathepsinA-neuraminidase 1 complex in cells of the haematopoietic lineage abolished atheroma plaque size progression and decreased leucocytes infiltration, clearly demonstrating the role of this complex in atherogenesis and suggesting the involvement of endogenous EP. Conclusion Altogether, this work identifies EP as an enhancer of atherogenesis and defines the Neuraminidase 1/PI3K gamma signalling pathway as a key mediator of this function in vitro and in vivo.

A Systematic Review	PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						review; heart failure; cardiac resynchronization therapy; cognitive function	CONGESTIVE-HEART-FAILURE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IMPAIRMENT; MANAGEMENT; DEMENTIA	Introduction Cognitive impairment (CI) comprises a measurable deficit of different cognitive domains (memory, attention, problem solving, and motor speed), and has a high prevalence among congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. Only a few pilot studies have investigated the effects of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on cognitive performance. The purpose of this systematic review is to outline and evaluate results of published studies that assess the impact of CRT on neuropsychological function in CHF. Methods Electronic databases were searched for articles containing the following terms: CRT, cognition, cognitive, and neurocognitive. A data extraction was performed according to our objective from each study. Effect sizes were computed using Hedges' g. The within-group formula was used for cohort studies with a pre-post design, while the between-group formula was used for studies that compared independent groups. Multiple outcomes were combined in domain-specific synthetic scores as well as in a global score for each study, and a fixed-effect model was used to estimate the summary effects. Results Only three studies met criteria for inclusion in the analysis. The results of these studies were discordant and methodological limitations were identified. The meta-analysis of cognitive outcomes showed a nonsignificant overall effect (Hedges' g = 0.131, 95% confidence interval: -0.16 to 0.422), while the summary effects on executive functioning and attention reached statistical significance (Hedges' g = 0.374, 95% confidence interval: 0.085-0.662 and Hedges' g = 0.343, 95% confidence interval: 0.051-0.635, respectively). Conclusion CI and related negative consequences have been largely documented in patients with heart failure but very few studies have assessed the plausible benefits of CRT on patients' cognitive function. Despite the statistical significance of the domain-specific pooled effects, their validity and clinical relevance is lacking due to methodological limitations.

In a longitudinal MRI study of patients with early Parkinson's disease, Hanganu et al. reveal higher rates of cortical thinning and subcortical atrophy in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared to those who are cognitively stable. MCI may indicate faster neurodegeneration.Previous studies have shown greater atrophy in grey and white matter of various brain regions in patients with Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment than in those without. These anatomical differences likely account for the distinct clinical profiles observed between those groups, but do not account for the evolution of regional brain degradation observed as the disease evolves. Although we have shown recently that cortical thinning correlates significantly more with disease duration in Parkinson's patients with mild cognitive impairment than in those without, to the best of our knowledge no study to date has explored this longitudinally. The present study investigated the longitudinal changes of the cortical and subcortical grey matter in patients with Parkinson's disease with and without mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, these two groups were compared with healthy controls. We found a higher rate of cortical thinning in the temporal, occipital, parietal and supplementary motor area, in patients with Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment compared with both cognitively stable patients and healthy controls. On the other hand cognitively stable patients had only one lateral occipital and one fusiform cluster with increased rate of thinning compared with healthy individuals. Correlating the rate of change of cortical thickness with the results of Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores revealed significant thinning associated with cognitive decline in the group of all patients, in similar regions including temporal and medial occipital lobe. Finally, a significant decrease in the volume of the amygdala and nucleus accumbens was observed specifically in patients with Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment. These results indicate that the early presence of mild cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease is associated with a faster rate of grey matter thinning in various cortical regions as well as a significant diminishment of limbic subcortical structures. This specific pattern of brain degradation associated with the early presence of mild cognitive impairment might serve as a marker of development toward dementia.

Evidence for both compensatory plastic and disuse atrophy-related neuroanatomical changes in the blind	BRAIN			English	Article						blindness; crossmodal plasticity; VBM; auditory; tactile; magnetization transfer imaging	TERM LIGHT DEPRIVATION; CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; LATE-ONSET; FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION	How does blindness affect brain structure? Voss et al. compare blind subjects and sighted controls using voxel-based morphometry and magnetization transfer imaging, and relate the data to auditory and tactile behavioural tasks. The results reveal a dissociation between neuroanatomical changes due to sensory deprivation and those related to compensatory reorganization.The behavioural and neurofunctional consequences of blindness are becoming increasingly well established, and it has become evident that the amount of reorganization is directly linked to the behavioural adaptations observed in the blind. However investigations of potential neuroanatomical changes resulting from blindness have yielded conflicting results as to the nature of the observed changes, because apparent loss of occipital tissue is difficult to reconcile with observed functional recruitment. To address this issue we used two complementary brain measures of neuroanatomy, voxel-based morphometry and magnetization transfer imaging, with the latter providing insight into myelin concentration through the magnetization transfer ratio. Both early and late blind, as well as sighted control subjects participated in the study and were tested on a series of auditory and tactile tasks to provide behavioural data that we could relate to neuroanatomy. The behavioural findings show that the early blind outperform the sighted in four of five tasks, whereas the late blind do so for only one. Moreover, correlations between the auditory and tactile performance of early blind individuals seem to indicate that they might benefit from some general-purpose compensatory plasticity mechanisms, as opposed to modality-specific ones. Neuroanatomical findings reveal three key findings: (i) occipital regions in the early blind have higher magnetization transfer ratio and grey matter concentration than in the sighted; (ii) behavioural performance of the blind is strongly predicted by magnetization transfer ratio and grey matter concentration in different occipital regions; and (iii) lower grey matter and white matter concentration was also found in other occipital areas in the early blind compared to the sighted. We thus show a clear dissociation between anatomical changes that are direct result of sensory deprivation and consequent atrophy, and those related to compensatory reorganization and behavioural adaptations. Moreover, the magnetization transfer ratio results also suggest that one mechanism for this reorganization may be related to increased myelination of intracortical neurons, or perhaps of fibres conveying information to and from remote locations.

Methods: A prospective cross-over study with infants in three gestational age groups (26-31, 32-36, and >= 37 weeks) at three university-affiliated Neonatal Intensive Care Units in Canada. One hundred and ninety five bedside nurses and expert raters rated 202 hospitalized infants' pain during scheduled procedures using the measure. An expert rater and a nurse independently assessed infants' pain scores, using the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised, during 246 scheduled pairs of painful and non-painful procedures in the 202 infants. Nurses also completed a feasibility survey on using the measure in a clinical setting. To establish construct validity, pain scores were computed during painful and non-painful procedures. Inter-rater reliability between pain experts and nurses was calculated. A 5-point Likert scale was used to measure feasibility in terms of clarity, ease of use, and time to complete. Results: Irrespective of gestational age, Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised scores were significantly higher during painful procedures (mean 6.7 [SD 3.0]) compared to non-painful procedures (mean 4.8 [SD 2.9]). There was a high degree of correlation between nurses' and experts' ratings for painful (all R-2 = 0.92, p < 0.001) and non-painful (all R-2 = 0.87, p < 0.001) procedures. Mean scores on all feasibility indicators were equal to or higher than 3.8. Discussion: The Premature Infant Pain Profile Revised has beginning construct validation, inter-rater reliability, and is considered feasible by clinicians. Concurrent validation studies should be considered. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Action relevance in linguistic context drives word-induced motor activity	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						embodied language; context-dependency; lexical semantics; conceptual flexibility; situation models	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; HUMAN BRAIN; TIME-COURSE; EMBODIED COGNITION; PREMOTOR CORTICES; SITUATION MODELS; EVENT KNOWLEDGE; ACTION VERBS; SENTENCE; MODULATION	Many neurocognitive studies on the role of motor structures in action-language processing have implicitly adopted a "dictionary-like" framework within which lexical meaning is constructed on the basis of an invariant set of semantic features. The debate has thus been centered on the question of whether motor activation is an integral part of the lexical semantics (embodied theories) or the result of a post-lexical construction of a situation model (disembodied theories). However, research in psycholinguistics show that lexical semantic processing and context-dependent meaning construction are narrowly integrated. An understanding of the role of motor structures in action-language processing might thus be better achieved by focusing on the linguistic contexts under which such structures are recruited. Here, we therefore analyzed online modulations of grip force while subjects listened to target words embedded in different linguistic contexts. When the target word was a hand action verb and when the sentence focused on that action (John signs the contract) an early increase of grip force was observed. No comparable increase was detected when the same word occurred in a context that shifted the focus toward the agent's mental state (John wants to sign the contract). There mere presence of an action word is thus not sufficient to trigger motor activation. Moreover, when the linguistic context set up a strong expectation for a hand action, a grip force increase was observed even when the tested word was a pseudo-verb. The presence of a known action word is thus not required to trigger motor activation. Importantly, however, the same linguistic contexts that sufficed to trigger motor activation with pseudo-verbs failed to trigger motor activation when the target words were verbs with no motor action reference. Context is thus not by itself sufficient to supersede an "incompatible" word meaning. We argue that motor structure activation is part of a dynamic process that integrates the lexical meaning potential of a term and the context in the online construction of a situation model, which is a crucial process for fluent and efficient online language comprehension.

Misregulation of either pathway is linked mainly to cancer or neural tube defects (NTDs), respectively. Both pathways seem to antagonize each other, and recent studies have implicated a number of molecular switches that activate one pathway while simultaneously inhibiting the other thereby partially mediating this antagonism. The lipoprotein receptor-related protein Lrp6 is crucial for the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, but its function in Wnt/PCP signaling remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of Lrp6 as a molecular switch between both Wnt pathways in a novel ENU mouse mutant of Lrp6 (Skax26(m1Jus)) and in human NTDs. We demonstrate that Skax26(m1Jus) represents a hypermorphic allele of Lrp6 with increased Wnt canonical and abolished PCP-induced JNK activities. We also show that Lrp6(Skax26-Jus) genetically interacts with a PCP mutant (Vangl2(Lp)) where double heterozygotes showed an increased frequency of NTDs and defects in cochlear hair cells' polarity. Importantly, our study also demonstrates the association of rare and novel missense mutations in LRP6 that is an inhibitor rather than an activator of the PCP pathway with human NTDs. We show that three LRP6 mutations in NTDs led to a reduced Wnt canonical activity and enhanced PCP signaling. Our data confirm an inhibitory role of Lrp6 in PCP signaling in neurulation and indicate the importance of a tightly regulated and highly dosage-sensitive antagonism between both Wnt pathways in this process.

DNAJC13 mutations in Parkinson disease	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							CLATHRIN-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; LRRK2; GENE; TRAFFICKING; ALIGNMENT; RETROMER; COMPLEX; GENOME; ROLES	A Saskatchewan multi-incident family was clinically characterized with Parkinson disease (PD) and Lewy body pathology. PD segregates as an autosomal-dominant trait, which could not be ascribed to any known mutation. DNA from three affected members was subjected to exome sequencing. Genome alignment, variant annotation and comparative analyses were used to identify shared coding mutations. Sanger sequencing was performed within the extended family and ethnically matched controls. Subsequent genotyping was performed in a multi-ethnic case-control series consisting of 2928 patients and 2676 control subjects from Canada, Norway, Taiwan, Tunisia, and the USA. A novel mutation in receptor-mediated endocytosis 8/RME-8 (DNAJC13 p.Asn855Ser) was found to segregate with disease. Screening of cases and controls identified four additional patients with the mutation, of which two had familial parkinsonism. All carriers shared an ancestral DNAJC13 p.Asn855Ser haplotype and claimed Dutch-German-Russian Mennonite heritage. DNAJC13 regulates the dynamics of clathrin coats on early endosomes. Cellular analysis shows that the mutation confers a toxic gain-of-function and impairs endosomal transport. DNAJC13 immunoreactivity was also noted within Lewy body inclusions. In late-onset disease which is most reminiscent of idiopathic PD subtle deficits in endosomal receptor-sorting/recycling are highlighted by the discovery of pathogenic mutations VPS35, LRRK2 and now DNAJC13. With this latest discovery, and from a neuronal perspective, a temporal and functional ecology is emerging that connects synaptic exo- and endocytosis, vesicular trafficking, endosomal recycling and the endo-lysosomal degradative pathway. Molecular deficits in these processes are genetically linked to the phenotypic spectrum of parkinsonism associated with Lewy body pathology.

Photothrombotic destruction of the internal capsule (IC) was conducted in Sprague Dawley rats (male; n = 38). The motor performance of all animals was assessed using forelimb placing, forelimb use asymmetry, and the single pellet reaching test. On the basis of the degree of motor recovery, rats were subdivided into either the poor recovery group (PRG) or the moderate recovery group (MRG). Imaging assessment of the impact of SCI on brain metabolism was performed using 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]-fluoro-D-glucose ([F-18]-FDG) microPET (positron emission tomography). Photothrombotic lesioning using low light energy selectively disrupted circumscribed capsular fibers. The MRG showed recovery of motor performance after 1 week, but the PRG showed a persistent motor impairment for >3 weeks. Damage to the posterior limb of the IC (PLIC) is more effective for producing a severe motor deficit. Analysis of PET data revealed decreased regional glucose metabolism in the ipsilesional motor and bilateral sensory cortex and increased metabolism in the contralesional motor cortex and bilateral hippocampus during the early recovery period after SCI. Behavioral, histologic, and functional imaging findings support the usefulness of this novel SCI rat model for investigating motor recovery.

We sought to determine whether healthy adolescents with subthreshold bipolar symptoms (SBP) would have early WM microstructural alterations and whether those alterations would be associated with differences in gray-matter (GM) volumes. Forty-two adolescents with three core manic symptoms and no psychiatric diagnosis, and 126 adolescents matched by age and sex, with no psychiatric diagnosis or symptoms, were identified after screening the IMAGEN database of 2223 young adolescents recruited from the general population. After image quality control, voxel-wise statistics were performed on the diffusion parameters using tract-based spatial statistics in 25 SBP adolescents and 77 controls, and on GM and WM images using voxel-based morphometry in 30 SBP adolescents and 106 controls. As compared with healthy controls, adolescents with SBP displayed lower FA values in a number of WM tracts, particularly in the corpus callosum, cingulum, bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, uncinate fasciculi and corticospinal tracts. Radial diffusivity was mainly higher in posterior parts of bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi and right cingulum. As compared with controls, SBP adolescents had lower GM volume in the left anterior cingulate region. This is the first study to investigate WM microstructure and GM morphometric variations in adolescents with SBP. The widespread FA alterations in association and projection tracts, associated with GM changes in regions involved in mood disorders, suggest altered structural connectivity in those adolescents.

G9a influences neuronal subtype specification in striatum	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MEDIUM SPINY NEURONS; TRANSLATIONAL PROFILING APPROACH; HISTONE METHYLTRANSFERASE G9A; COCAINE-INDUCED PLASTICITY; CNS CELL-TYPES; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DELTA-FOSB; ADDICTION; BEHAVIOR; METHYLATION	Cocaine-mediated repression of the histone methyltransferase (HMT) G9a has recently been implicated in transcriptional, morphological and behavioral responses to chronic cocaine administration. Here, using a ribosomal affinity purification approach, we found that G9a repression by cocaine occurred in both Drd1-expressing (striatonigral) and Drd2-expressing (striatopallidal) medium spiny neurons. Conditional knockout and overexpression of G9a within these distinct cell types, however, revealed divergent behavioral phenotypes in response to repeated cocaine treatment. Our studies further indicated that such developmental deletion of G9a selectively in Drd2 neurons resulted in the unsilencing of transcriptional programs normally specific to striatonigral neurons and in the acquisition of Drd1-associated projection and electrophysiological properties. This partial striatopallidal to striatonigral 'switching' phenotype in mice indicates a new role for G9a in contributing to neuronal subtype identity and suggests a critical function for cell type-specific histone methylation patterns in the regulation of behavioral responses to environmental stimuli.

Fluoxetine Epigenetically Alters the CaMKII alpha Promoter in Nucleus Accumbens to Regulate Delta FosB Binding and Antidepressant Effects	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						CaMKII; histone; accumbens; fluoxetine; Delta FosB; depression	PROTEIN-KINASE-II; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; CHROMATIN REGULATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; COCAINE REWARD; SOCIAL DEFEAT; STRESS; DEPRESSION; RECEPTOR; EXPRESSION	Chronic social defeat stress in mice produces a susceptible phenotype characterized by several behavioral abnormalities consistent with human depression that are reversed by chronic but not acute exposure to antidepressant medications. Recent work in addiction models demonstrates that the transcription factor Delta FosB and protein kinase calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) are co-regulated in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain reward region implicated in both addiction and depression models including social defeat. Previous work has also demonstrated that Delta FosB is induced in NAc after chronic social defeat stress or after chronic antidepressant treatment, wherein it mediates a pro-resilience or antidepressant-like phenotype. Here, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that Delta FosB binds the CaMKII alpha gene promoter in NAc and that this binding increases after mice are exposed to chronic social defeat stress. Paradoxically, chronic exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine reduces binding of Delta FosB to the CaMKII alpha promoter and reduces CaMKII expression in NAc, despite the fact that Delta FosB is induced under these conditions. These data suggest a novel epigenetic mechanism of antidepressant action, whereby fluoxetine induces some chromatin change at the CaMKII alpha promoter, which blocks the Delta FosB binding. Indeed, chronic fluoxetine reduces acetylation and increases lysine-9 dimethylation of histone H3 at the CaMKII alpha promoter in NAc, effects also seen in depressed humans exposed to antidepressants. Overexpression of CaMKII in NAc blocks fluoxetine's antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat paradigm, whereas inhibition of CaMKII activity in NAc mimics fluoxetine exposure. These findings suggest that epigenetic suppression of CaMKII alpha expression in NAc is behaviorally relevant and offer a novel pathway for possible therapeutic intervention in depression and related syndromes.

In adults, repeated amphetamine upregulates DCC receptor expression selectively in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), an effect that is critical for sensitization. In contrast, amphetamine administered to juveniles downregulates VTA DCC expression. Moreover, whereas adult dcc heterozygous mice fail to sensitize when repeatedly treated with amphetamine, drug treatment during the juvenile period actually abolishes this adult "protective" phenotype. We set out to determine whether adolescence (PND similar to 35-55) is a period during which: (1) amphetamine-induced alterations in VTA DCC expression switch from downregulation to upregulation; (2) the "protective" phenotype of adult dcc heterozygotes against sensitization becomes evident; and (3) the adult "protective" phenotype of dcc heterozygotes can still be abolished by repeated amphetamine treatment. Repeated amphetamine did not significantly alter VTA DCC expression in adolescent rodents when assessed 1 week later. Both wild-type and dcc heterozygous mice exhibited sensitization at this time. Remarkably, wild-type mice, but not dcc heterozygotes, exhibited sensitization when tested during adulthood. Adolescence is a time of transition for dcc heterozygotes as related to sensitization. Our results support the hypothesis that DCC may be a key factor in determining age-dependent individual differences in vulnerability to sensitization. Given that exposure to drugs of abuse during adolescence can have profound consequences for adulthood, the resilience of adult dcc heterozygous mice against adolescent exposure to amphetamine is particularly salient.

These studies have used different treatment onset time, duration and non-invasive methods of inhibition. Whereas these results are encouraging, several questions regarding the mechanisms of inhibition and the most effective treatment parameters are currently unanswered. In the present study, we used a rat model of cortical lesion to study the effects of GABA-mediated inactivation on motor recovery. In particular, we were interested in understanding better the effect of inactivation duration when it is initiated within hours following a cortical lesion. Cortical lesions were induced with endothelin-1 microinjections. The contralesional hemisphere was inactivated with continuous infusion of the GABA-A agonist Muscimol for 3, 7 or 14 days in three different groups of animals. In a fourth group, Muscimol was infused at slower rate for 14 days to provide additional insights on the relation between the effects of inactivation on the non-paretic forelimb behavior and the recovery of the paretic forelimb. In spontaneously recovered animals, the lesion caused a sustained bias to use the non-paretic forelimb and long-lasting grasping deficits with the paretic forelimb. Contralesional inactivation produced a general decrease of behavioral activity, affected the spontaneous use of the forelimbs and caused a specific reduction of the non-paretic forelimb function. The intensity and the duration of these behavioral effects varied in the different experimental groups. For the paretic forelimb, increasing inactivation duration accelerated the recovery of grasping function. Both groups with 14 days of inactivation had similar recovery profiles and performed better than animals that spontaneously recovered. Whereas the plateau performance of the paretic forelimb correlated with the duration of contralesional inactivation, it was not correlated with the spontaneous use of the forelimbs or with grasping performance of the non-paretic hand. Our results support that contralesional inactivation initiated within hours after a cortical lesion can improve recovery of the paretic forelimb. In our model, increasing the duration of the inactivation improved motor outcomes but the spontaneous use and motor performance of the non-paretic forelimb had no impact on recovery of the paretic forelimb.

Astroglial heme oxygenase-1 and the origin of corpora amylacea in aging and degenerating neural tissues	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; Astrocyte; Corpora amylacea; Heme oxygenase-1; Mild cognitive impairment; Mitochondria; Transgenic mice	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BRAIN IRON DEPOSITION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RAT ASTROGLIA; ASTROCYTIC COMPARTMENT; OVER-EXPRESSION; INDUCTION; MICE; CYSTEAMINE; INCLUSIONS	Background: Corpora amylacea (CA) are glycoproteinaceous (predominantly glial and extracellular) inclusions that accumulate in normal aging brain and, to a greater extent, in Alzheimer disease (AD). Previous pharmacological evidence suggested that up-regulation of endogenous heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in astrocytes promotes transformation of normal mitochondria to CA-like inclusions. Here, we determined whether 1) HMOX1 transfection fosters the accumulation of CA-like inclusions in cultured rat astroglia; 2) the HMOX1 transgene promotes CA formation in the brains of aging GFAP.HMOX1 mice; and 3) brain mitochondrial damage and CA biogenesis are augmented in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a harbinger of AD. Methods: CA were ascertained in (i) neonatal rat astroglia transfected with flag-tagged human HO-1 cDNA, (ii) brain sections derived from 19 month-old GFAP.HMOX1 and wild-type (WT) mice, and (iii) post-mortem hippocampal sections from individuals with mild (MCI) and no cognitive impairment (NCI) after staining with PAS or antisera against HO-1, ubiquitin (Ub), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and a-synuclein or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Results: HMOX1 transfection induced cytoplasmic vacuolation and the accumulation of PAS+ inclusions in cultured astroglia. Numerous CA-like inclusions stained with PAS and immunoreactive for HO-1, Ub and MnSOD were observed in the brains of GFAP.HMOX1 mice, but were rarely encountered in age-matched, WI' controls. Numbers of HO-1-positive CA were significantly increased in certain hippocampal strata of MCI subjects relative to NCI preparations. MnSOD and Ub proteins co-localized to CA in both the control and MCI specimens. Conclusions: HO-1 promotes mitochondrial damage and CA biogenesis in astrocyte cultures and in the intact aging brain. CA formation is enhanced in the MCI hippocampus and thus occurs relatively early in the pathogenesis of AD. Glial HO-1 suppression may attenuate bioenergetic failure and slow disease progression in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions featuring accelerated accumulation of CA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Progress in this field has thereby consistently been hindered by a lack of novel conceptual approaches and sophisticated experimental techniques to dissect the highly intricate neurobiology of depression. Using fresh approaches to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying depression will thus be vital for discovery of novel antidepressant targets. Areas covered: This article provides an overview of some fundamental problems that depression research is currently facing and critically evaluates how these issues could be addressed by future research. It also discusses novel conceptual and technological advances in the field of neuroscience, particularly in regard to how they may help in providing unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanisms of depression pathogenesis. Expert opinion: Although progress in antidepressant drug discovery has been limited over recent years, modern innovations in neuroscience, molecular biology, genetics and bioinformatics are just beginning to revolutionize depression research and to reveal novel and promising treatment targets. Integrating findings from a range of relevant experimental models and using the most advanced technology will be vital for the future success of antidepressant drug discovery.

A.; Giacobbe, Peter			Effectiveness and acceptability of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subgenual cingulate cortex for treatment-resistant depression: A systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Review						Deep brain stimulation; Treatment-resistant depression; Effectiveness; Acceptability	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; REFRACTORY MAJOR DEPRESSION; LONG-TERM; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; MECHANISMS; OUTCOMES; CONNECTIVITY; MULTICENTER; DISORDERS; CIRCUITRY	Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) applied to the subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC) has been recently investigated as a potential treatment for severe and chronic treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Given its invasive and experimental nature, a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness and acceptability is of paramount importance. Therefore, we conducted the present systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis. Methods: We searched the literature for English language prospective clinical trials on DBS of the SCC for TRD from 1999 through December 2012 using MEDUNE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and SCOPUS, and performed a random effects exploratory meta-analysis using Event Rates and Hedges' g effect sizes. Results: Data from 4 observational studies were included, totaling 66 subjects with severe and chronic TRD. Twelve-month response and remission rates following DBS treatment were 39.9% (95% Cl=28.4% to 52.8%) and 26.3% (95% Cl=13% to 45.9%), respectively. Also, depression scores at 12 months post-DBS were significantly reduced (i.e., pooled Hedges' g effect size=-1.89 [95% Cl=-2.64 to -1.15, p < 0.00011). Also, there was a significant decrease in depression scores between 3 and 6 months (Hedges' g=-0.27, p=0.003), but no significant changes from months 6 to 12. Finally, dropout rates at 12 months were 10.8% (95% Cl=4.3% to 24.4%). Limitations: Small number of included studies (most of which were open label), and limited long-term effectiveness data. Conclusions: DBS applied to the SCC seems to be associated with relatively large response and remission rates in the short- and medium-to long-term in patients with severe TRD. Also, its maximal antidepressant effects are mostly observed within the first 6 months after device implantation. Nevertheless, these findings are clearly preliminary and future controlled trials should include larger and more representative samples, and focus on the identification of optimal neuroanatomical sites and stimulation parameters.

Both these oscillations are markers of neuronal plasticity, and play a role in memory and cognition. Normal ageing is associated with spindle and slow wave decline and cognitive changes. The present study aimed to assess whether spindle and slow wave characteristics during a baseline night predict cognitive performance in healthy older adults the next morning. Specifically, we examined performance on tasks measuring selective and sustained visual attention, declarative verbal memory, working memory and verbal fluency. Fifty-eight healthy middle-aged and older adults (aged 50-91years) without sleep disorders underwent baseline polysomnographic sleep recording followed by neuropsychological assessment the next morning. Spindles and slow waves were detected automatically on artefact-free non-rapid eye movement sleep electroencephalogram. All-night stage N2 spindle density (no./min) and mean frequency (Hz) and all-night non-rapid eye movement sleep slow wave density (no./min) and mean slope (V/s) were analysed. Pearson's correlations were performed between spindles, slow waves, polysomnography and cognitive performance. Higher spindle density predicted better performance on verbal learning, visual attention and verbal fluency, whereas spindle frequency and slow wave density or slope predicted fewer cognitive performance variables. In addition, rapid eye movement sleep duration was associated with better verbal learning potential. These results suggest that spindle density is a marker of cognitive functioning in older adults and may reflect neuroanatomic integrity. Rapid eye movement sleep may be a marker of age-related changes in acetylcholine transmission, which plays a role in new information encoding.

The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal association between sleep apnea-hypopnea events and sleep bruxism events. In an open observational study, data were gathered from 10 male subjects with confirmed obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome and concomitant sleep bruxism. Polysomnography and audio-video recordings were performed for 1night in a sleep laboratory. Breathing, brain, heart and masticatory muscle activity signals were analysed to quantify sleep and sleep stage duration, and number and temporal distribution of apnea-hypopnea events and sleep bruxism events. Apnea-hypopnea events were collected within a 5-min time window before and after sleep bruxism events, with the sleep bruxism events as the pivotal reference point. Two temporal patterns were analysed: (i) the interval between apnea-hypopnea events termination and sleep bruxism events onset, called T1; and (ii) the interval between sleep bruxism events termination and apnea-hypopnea events onset, called T2. Of the intervals between sleep bruxism events and the nearest apnea-hypopnea event, 80.5% were scored within 5min. Most intervals were distributed within a period of <30s, with peak at 0-10s. The T1 interval had a mean length of 33.4s and was significantly shorter than the T2 interval (64.0s; P<0.05). Significantly more sleep bruxism events were scored in association with the T1 than the T2 pattern (P<0.05). Thus, in patients with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome and sleep bruxism, most sleep bruxism events occurred after sleep apnea-hypopnea events, suggesting that sleep bruxism events occurring close to sleep apnea-hypopnea events is a secondary form of sleep bruxism.

Regulation of cell-surface receptors by means of transcriptional control, local translation, trafficking and proteolytic processing are powerful mechanisms to regulate the response of the growth cone. Important work has also revealed how intracellular signalling pathways, including calcium and cyclic nucleotide signalling, can alter the directional response elicited by a particular cue. Here, we describe how these multiple regulatory mechanisms influence growth cone turning behaviour. We focus on recent evidence that suggests a significant role for 14-3-3 adaptor proteins in modifying growth cone turning behaviour and mediating directional polarity switches during development. Characterizing how 14-3-3 s regulate growth cone signalling will provide invaluable insight into nervous system development and may facilitate the identification of novel targets for promoting nerve regeneration following injury.

In contrast to traditional vector representation-based dimensionality reduction methods, LMLRTA can take any order of tensors as input. And unlike previous tensor dimensionality reduction methods, which can learn only the low-dimensional embeddings with a priori specified dimensionality, LMLRTA can automatically and jointly learn the dimensionality and the low-dimensional representations from data. Moreover, LMLRTA delivers low rank projection matrices, while it encourages data of the same class to be close and of different classes to be separated by a large margin of distance in the low-dimensional tensor space. LMLRTA can be optimized using an iterative fixed-point continuation algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to a local optimal solution of the optimization problem. We evaluate LMLRTA on an object recognition application, where the data are represented as 2D tensors, and a face recognition application, where the data are represented as 3D tensors. Experimental results show the superiority of LMLRTA over state-of-the-art approaches.

Based on the hypothesis that modulation of gut microbiota by this probiotic formulation has beneficial effects on brain activity in stress conditions, we report a set of probiotic-evoked physiological, cellular, and molecular events in the brain of Probio'Stick((R)) pretreated mice submitted to chronic psychological stress. MethodsWater avoidance stress (WAS) was applied or not (sham). Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to the chronic stress were assessed through plasma corticosterone and catecholamine measurements. Specific markers for neuronal activity, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity were used to assess brain activity. In addition, gut permeability and tight junction (TJ) proteins levels were also determinated. Key ResultsWe observed that a pretreatment with the probiotic formulation attenuated HPA axis and ANS activities in response to WAS, and reduced cFos expression in different brain areas but Lactobacillussalivarius (a negative control) treatment was ineffective on these parameters. Moreover, probiotic pretreatment prevented the WAS-induced decrease hippocampal neurogenesis and expression changes in hypothalamic genes involved in synaptic plasticity. These central effects were associated with restoration of TJ barrier integrity in stressed mice. Conclusions & InferencesThese data suggest that chronic stress-induced abnormal brain plasticity and reduction in neurogenesis can be prevented by a pretreatment with the Probio'Stick((R)) formulation, suggesting that probiotics modulate neuroregulatory factors and various signaling pathways in the central nervous system involved in stress response.

These data provide critical insights into the role of local processing that these ganglia play in the regulation of cardiac function. Low firing rates, marked non-stationarity, interplay with the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems and artifacts generated by myocardial activity create new constraints not present in brain recordings for which almost all neuronal analysis techniques have been developed. We adapted and extended the jitter-based synchrony index (SI) to (1) provide a robust and computationally efficient tool for assessing the level and statistical significance of SI between cardiac neurons, (2) estimate the bias on SI resulting from neuronal activity possibly hidden in myocardial artifacts, (3) quantify the synchrony or anti-synchrony between neuronal activity and the phase in the cardiac and respiratory cycles. The method was validated on firing time series from a total of 98 individual neurons identified in 8 dog experiments. SI ranged from -0.14 to 0.66, with 23 pairs of neurons with SI > 0.1. The estimated bias due to artifacts was typically <1%. Strongly cardiovascular-and pulmonary-related neurons (SI > 0.5) were found. Results support the use of jitter-based SI in the context of intrinsic cardiac neurons.

There are a multiplicity of possible causes many of which have genetic, management and treatment implications for the child and family. Genetic causes are estimated to be responsible for approximately a quarter to one-half of identified cases. The multiplicity of individually rare genetic causes challenges the practitioner with respect to the selection of diagnostic tests and accurate diagnosis. To assist the practitioner practice guidelines have been formulated and these are reviewed and summarised in this particular article.

Bias to evoke signaling as opposed to sequestration has been proposed as a predictor of opioid ligand potential for generating tolerance. Here we measured whether delta opioid receptor agonists preferentially inhibited cyclase activity over internalization in HEK cells. Efficacy (tau) and affinity (KA) values were estimated from functional data and bias was calculated from efficiency coefficients (log tau/KA). This approach better represented the data as compared to alternative methods that estimate bias exclusively from tau values. Log (tau/KA) coefficients indicated that SNC-80 and UFP-512 promoted cyclase inhibition more efficiently than DOR internalization as compared to DPDPE (bias factor for SNC-80: 50 and for UFP-512: 132). Molecular determinants of internalization were different in HEK293 cells and neurons with beta arrs contributing to internalization in both cell types, while PKC and GRK2 activities were only involved in neurons. Rank orders of ligand ability to engage different internalization mechanisms in neurons were compared to rank order of E (max) values for cyclase assays in HEK cells. Comparison revealed a significant reversal in rank order for cyclase E (max) values and beta arr-dependent internalization in neurons, indicating that these responses were ligand-specific. Despite this evidence, and because kinases involved in internalization were not the same across cellular backgrounds, it is not possible to assert if the magnitude and nature of bias revealed by rank orders of maximal responses is the same as the one measured in HEK cells.

Its genesis is closely associated with sensitization of nociceptive primary sensory neurons (nociceptors) and dorsal horn neurons by various pain mediators produced during inflammation and tissue injury. Growing evidence showed that increasing cell surface trafficking of pain-facilitating receptors is an important mechanism underlying the peripheral and central sensitization. Areas covered: We summarized the progress of this area over the past decade by showing that inflammation, tissue damage or pain mediators facilitate cell surface trafficking of pain-facilitating receptors such as transient receptor potential vanilloid-1, transient receptor potential ankyrin-1, voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8, P2X3 and EP4 in primary sensory neurons, GluR1 and GluR2 of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, NR1 and NR2 of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and acid-sensing ion channels 1 in dorsal horn neurons and P2X4 in spinal microglia. The anti-allodynic effects of gabapentin was mediated by blocking surface trafficking of alpha 2 delta 1 and alpha 2 delta 2 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels in primary sensory and dorsal horn neurons. Expert opinion: Pain mediators stimulate forward surface trafficking of their own and/or other pain-facilitating receptors to amplify pain intensity and duration. Enhancing surface abundance of pain-facilitating receptors in nociceptors and dorsal horn neurons is an important mechanism underpinning chronic pain states. Targeting specific trafficking events of pain-facilitating receptors may open a novel therapeutic avenue to more efficiently treat chronic pain conditions.

A new view of the effect of dopamine receptor antagonism on operant performance for rewarding brain stimulation in the rat	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Pimozide; Opportunity cost; Neuroeconomics; Reward mountain; Intracranial self-stimulation; ICSS; Neuroleptics	MEDIAL FOREBRAIN-BUNDLE; ELECTRICAL SELF-STIMULATION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; MATCHING LAW; SUBJECTIVE MAGNITUDE; NEURAL SYSTEMS; MIDBRAIN; REINFORCEMENT; STRENGTH	Previous studies of neuroleptic challenges to intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) employed two-dimensional (2D) measurements (curve shifts). Results so obtained are ambiguous with regard to the stage of neural processing at which the drug produces its performance-altering effect. We substituted a three-dimensional (3D) method that measures reward-seeking as a function of both the strength and cost of reward. This method reveals whether changes in reward seeking are due to drug action prior to the output of the circuitry that performs spatiotemporal integration of the stimulation-induced neural activity. The aim of this study was to obtain new information about the stage of neural processing at which pimozide acts to alter pursuit of brain stimulation reward (BSR). Following treatment with pimozide (0.1 mg/kg) or its vehicle, the proportion of trial time allocated to working for BSR was measured as a function of pulse frequency and opportunity cost. A surface defined by Shizgal's reward-mountain model was fitted to the drug and vehicle data. Pimozide lowered the cost required to decrease performance for a maximal BSR to half its maximal level but did not alter the pulse-frequency required to produce a reward of half-maximal intensity. Like indirect dopamine agonists, pimozide does not alter the sensitivity of brain reward circuity but changes reward-system gain, subjective effort costs, and/or the value of activities that compete with ICSS. The 3D method is more sensitive and informative than the 2D methods employed previously.

Given that the replenishment rate is also not [Ca++](o) sensitive this puts into question a widely held notion that the vesicles-constrained by the cytoskeleton and rendered free from such constraints by Ca++ entry that renders them more mobile-are important in the replenishment of the readily-releasable pool. This raises a question-Is vesicular replenishment of the readily releasable pool associated with significant movement? To answer this question we evaluated how okadaic acid and staurosporine (compounds known to affect vesicular mobility) influence the replenishment rate. We used patterned stimulation on the Schaffer collateral fiber pathway and recorded the excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) from rat CA1 neurons, in the absence and presence of these drugs. The parameters of a circuit model with two vesicular pools were estimated by minimizing the squared difference between the ESPC amplitudes and simulated model output. [Ca2+](o) did not influence the progressive decrease of the replenishment rate during long, high frequency stimulation. Okadaic acid did not significantly affect any parameters of the vesicular storage and release system, including the replenishment rate. Staurosporine reduced the replenishment coupling, but not the replenishment rate, and this is owing to the fact that it also reduces the ability of the readily releasable pool to contain quanta. Moreover, these compounds were ineffective in influencing how the replenishment rate decreases during long, high frequency stimulation. In conclusion at the excitatory synapses of rat hippocampus the replenishment of the readily releasable pool does not appear to be associated with a significant vesicular movement, and during long high frequency stimulation [Ca++](o) does not influence the progressive decrease of vesicular replenishment.

We therefore studied the relationship between oxidative stress and DNA methylation in patients with BD with an excellent response to lithium treatment, their affected and unaffected relatives and healthy controls. Transformed lymphoblasts were cultured in the presence or absence of lithium chloride (0.75mm). DNA and proteins were extracted from the cells to determine levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 5-methylcytosine (5-mc), mitochondrial complex I and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. Methylation was decreased in BD subjects and their relatives compared to controls and remained so after lithium treatment in BD subjects but not in their relatives. 8-OHdG levels and complex I activity did not differ between groups before and after lithium treatment. Finally, relatives of patients showed increased GPx activity before and after lithium treatment, which negatively correlated with 5-mc levels. Changes in global methylation may be specific for BD and lithium may be involved in glutathione regulation. The present study supports the importance of DNA methylation to the pathophysiology of BD and the therapeutic potential of antioxidants in this illness.

J	Rossi, M				Rossi, Mauro			Simulation theory and interpersonal utility comparisons reconsidered	SYNTHESE			English	Article						Interpersonal utility comparisons; Desire strengths; Simulation theory; Mindreading	DECISION-MAKING; NEURAL BASIS; WELFARE; ETHICS; CHOICE	According to a popular strategy amongst economists and philosophers, in order to solve the problem of interpersonal utility comparisons, we have to look at how ordinary people make such comparisons in everyday life. The most recent attempt to develop this strategy has been put forward by Goldman in his "Simulation and Interpersonal Utility" (Ethics 4:709-726, 1995). Goldman claims, first, that ordinary people make interpersonal comparisons by simulation and, second, that simulation is reliable for making interpersonal comparisons. In this paper, I focus on Goldman's latter claim. After updating Goldman's account of how ordinary people make interpersonal comparisons in the light of Goldman's newest formulation of his simulation theory of mental ascription (Goldman, Simulating Minds. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006), I develop and assess Goldman's arguments in favour of the reliability of simulation for interpersonal comparisons. I argue that, under certain conditions, there may be room for a scientifically acceptable solution to the problem of interpersonal utility comparisons.

An objective auditory measure to assess speech recognition in adult cochlear implant users	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Cochlear implant; Auditory evoked potential; Speech perception; Mismatch negativity	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; CHILDREN; BRAIN; RECIPIENTS	Objective: To verify if a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm based on speech syllables can differentiate between good and poorer cochlear implant (CI) users on a speech recognition task. Methods: Twenty adults with a CI and 11 normal hearing adults participated in the study. Based on a speech recognition test, ten CI users were classified as good performers and ten as poor performers. We measured the MMN with /da/ as the standard stimulus and /ba/ and /ga/ as the deviants. Separate analyses were conducted on the amplitude and latency of the MMN. Results: A MMN was evoked by both deviant stimuli in all normal hearing participants and in well performing CI users, with similar amplitudes for both groups. However, the amplitude of the MMN was significantly reduced for the poorer CI users compared to the normal hearing group and the good CI users. The latency was longer for both groups of cochlear implant users. A bivariate correlation showed a significant positive correlation between the speech recognition score and the amplitude of the MMN. Conclusions: The MMN can distinguish between CI users who have good versus poor speech recognition as assessed with conventional tasks.

Method: COMT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs; rs6269, rs4633, rs4818, and rs4680) were genotyped in 445 ADHD children. EF was assessed using Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of London, and self-ordered pointing task. COMT haplotypes were tested for association using family-based association testing (fBAT) and quantitative trait analyses. Results: fBAT analysis showed no association between COMT alleles/haplotypes and ADHD diagnosis and EF parameters. Using ANCOVA in the Caucasian only sample, significant associations between COMT haplotypes, and WCST indices were observed. However, after correction for multipletesting, the only significant effect observed was between rs6269 and the number of categories completed (a measure of concept formation ability) on the WCST, F(1,285) = 8.92, p = .003. Conclusion: These results tentatively implicate COMT gene in modulating EF in children with ADHD.

Method: In all, 21 TD and 23 ADHD adolescents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a forethought task. The participants had to identify congruent and incongruent stimuli from cartoon stories representing sequences of action. Results: The findings revealed significantly greater activation in the bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in TD versus ADHD children, and more activation in the cerebellar vermis in the adolescents with ADHD versus TD, during performance of the incongruent relative to congruent condition. Conclusion: The inverse pattern of activation of the PFC and the cerebellar vermis in both groups could reflect a compensatory role played by the cerebellum or suggest the malfunction of the neural network between those regions in ADHD. Further research of the neural correlates of forethought in ADHD is warranted.

The lack of stability and of sensitivity of current voxel-based analysis schemes may however lead to non-reproducible results. We introduce a new approach to overcome the limitations of standard methods, in which active voxels are detected according to a consensus on several random parcellations of the brain images, while a permutation test controls the false positive risk. Both on synthetic and real data, this approach shows higher sensitivity, better accuracy and higher reproducibility than state-of-the-art methods. In a neuroimaging-genetic application, we find that it succeeds in detecting a significant association between a genetic variant next to the COMT gene and the BOLD signal in the left thalamus for a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging contrast associated with incorrect responses of the subjects from a Stop Signal Task protocol.

Heterogeneity of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in adult human brain	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article								Objective: Remyelination in multiple sclerosis has been attributed to the presence of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in brain parenchyma. However, the precise identity of these progenitors is poorly defined. Here, we characterized populations of OPCs in the adult human brain and examined their myelination capacity and profile of miRNAs. Comparisons were made with fetal OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes. Methods: We isolated human adult and fetal (earlyto- mid second trimester) OPCs from surgically resected brain tissues using O4-, A2B5-, and MOG-directed fluorescence activated cell sorting and transplanted them into dysmyelinated shiverer slices to examine their myelination capacity. We used qRT-PCR to analyze expression of selective miRNAs implicated in OPC biology. Results: Three subsets of putative OPCs were identified in adult brains: (1) A2B5(+), (2) O4(low), and (3) A2B5(+)O4(high) MOG(+) progenitors. In comparison, fetal brains contained (1) A2B5(+), (2) O4(+), and (3) A2B5(+)O4(+) progenitors, but no MOG(+) cells. We demonstrate that like fetal OPCs, adult OPCs have the capacity to ensheathe cerebellar axons. However, adult OPCs exhibit low to undetectable expression of miRNAs that were highly expressed in O4-expressing fetal OPCs. Adult OPCs also express different miRNAs compared to mature oligodendrocytes. Interpretation: We conclude that phenotypically distinct subsets of OPCs are present in adult human brain and these OPCs show differential miRNA expression compared to fetal OPCs and mature oligodendrocytes. These suggest that remyelination in adult brain may involve multiple populations of progenitors within the brain and that OPC differentiation in adulthood may be differentially regulated compared to development.

Image-based retrieval of concrete crack properties for bridge inspection	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Crack quantification; Visual inspection; Change detection; Spectral analysis; Branch points; Neural networks; 3D visualization	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPACE	Cracking can invite sudden failures of concrete structures. The objective of this research is to develop an integrated model based on digital image processing in developing the numerical representation of defects. The integration model consists of crack quantification, change detection, neural networks, and 3D visualization models to visualize the defects in such a way that it mimics the on-site visual inspections. The crack quantification model evaluates crack lengths based on the perimeter of the skeleton of a crack which considers the tortuosity of the crack. The change detection model is based on the Fourier Transform of digital images eliminating the need for image registration as required in the traditional. Also, the integrated model as proposed here for crack length and change detection is supported by neural networks to predict crack depth and 3D visualization of crack patterns considering crack density as a key attribute.

Comparative analyses in different species and organ systems have revealed that GRN blueprints are composed of subcircuits with stereotypical architectures that are often reused as modular units. In this review, we report the evidence for the GRN underlying renal primordium development. In vertebrates, renal development is initiated by the induction of a field of intermediate mesoderm cells competent to undergo lineage specification and nephric (Wolffian) duct formation. Definition of the renal field leads to the activation of a core regulatory subcircuit composed of the transcription factors Pax2/8, Gata3 and Lim1. These transcription factors turn on a second layer of transcriptional regulators while also activating effectors of tissue morphogenesis and cellular specialization. Elongation and connection of the nephric duct to the cloaca (bladder/urethra primordium) is followed by metanephric kidney induction through signals emanating from the metanephric mesenchyme. Central to this process is the activation and positioning of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf)-Ret signaling pathway by network subcircuits located in the mesenchyme and epithelial tissues of the caudal trunk. Evidence shows that each step of the renal primordium developmental program is regulated by structured GRN subunits organized in a hierarchical manner. Understanding the structure and dynamics of the renal GRN will help us understand the intrinsic phenotypical variability of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract and guide our approaches to regenerative medicine.

J	Chen, GY				Chen, Guangyi			Automatic EEG seizure detection using dual-tree complex wavelet-Fourier features	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Seizure detection; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT); Fourier transform	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPSY; SIGNALS; MODEL; RECOGNITION; DESCRIPTOR; TRANSFORM	Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders with 0.8% of the world population. The epilepsy is unpredictable and recurrent, so it is very difficult to treat. In this paper, we propose a new Electroencephalography (EEG) seizure detection method by using the dual-tree complex wavelet (DTCWT) - Fourier features. These features achieve perfect classification rates (100%) for the EEG database from the University of Bonn. These classification rates outperform a number of existing EEG seizure detection methods published in the literature. However, it should be mentioned that several recent works also achieved this perfect classification rate (100%). Our proposed method should be as good as these works since our method only performs the DTCWT transform for up to 5 scales and our method only conducts the FFT to the 4th and 5th scales of the DTCWT decomposition. In addition, we could replace the conventional FFT in our method by sparse FFT so that our method could be even faster. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

THE TASTE-VISUAL CROSS-MODAL STROOP EFFECT: AN EVENT-RELATED BRAIN POTENTIAL STUDY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Stroop effect; conflict control; cross modality; event-related brain potentials	RESPONSE SELECTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; INTERFERENCE; INTEGRATION; CORTEX; CONFLICT; PERFORMANCE; MEMORY; ODORS; ERP	Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to explore, for the first time, the electrophysiological correlates of the taste-visual cross-modal Stroop effect. Eighteen healthy participants were presented with a taste stimulus and a food image, and asked to categorize the image as "sweet" or "sour" by pressing the relevant button as quickly as possible. Accurate categorization of the image was faster when it was presented with a congruent taste stimulus (e. g., sour taste/image of lemon) than with an incongruent one (e. g., sour taste/image of ice cream). ERP analyses revealed a negative difference component (ND430-620) between 430 and 620 ms in the taste-visual cross-modal Stroop interference. Dipole source analysis of the difference wave (incongruent minus congruent) indicated that two generators localized in the prefrontal cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus contributed to this taste-visual cross-modal Stroop effect. This result suggests that the prefrontal cortex is associated with the process of conflict control in the taste-visual cross-modal Stroop effect. Also, we speculate that the parahippocampal gyrus is associated with the process of discordant information in the taste-visual cross-modal Stroop effect. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Mounting evidence indicates that RNA localization, where specific mRNAs are transported subcellularly and subsequently translated in response to localized signals, is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to control protein localization. On-site synthesis confers novel signaling properties to a protein and helps to maintain local proteome homeostasis.

Compound heterozygous mutations in glycyl-tRNA synthetase are a proposed cause of systemic mitochondrial disease	BMC MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article						Glycyl-tRNA synthetase; Amino acyl-tRNA synthetase; Cardiomyopathy; Charcot-Marie-tooth disease	MARIE-TOOTH NEUROPATHY; SEQUENCING DATA; VARIANTS; GENE	Background: Glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) is an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) that links the amino acid glycine to its corresponding tRNA prior to protein translation and is one of three bifunctional ARS that are active within both the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Dominant mutations in GARS cause rare forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and distal spinal muscular atrophy. Case presentation: We report a 12-year old girl who presented with clinical and biochemical features of a systemic mitochondrial disease including exercise-induced myalgia, non-compaction cardiomyopathy, persistent elevation of blood lactate and alanine and MRI evidence of mild periventricular leukomalacia. Using exome sequencing she was found to harbor compound heterozygous mutations within the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene; c.1904C > T; p.Ser635Leu and c.1787G > A; p.Arg596Gln. Each mutation occurred at a highly conserved site within the anticodon binding domain. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that recessive mutations in GARS may cause systemic mitochondrial disease. This phenotype is distinct from patients with previously reported dominant mutations in this gene, thereby expanding the spectrum of disease associated with GARS dysregulation.

Discharge Profiles across the Sleep-Waking Cycle of Identified Cholinergic, GABAergic, and Glutamatergic Neurons in the Pontomesencephalic Tegmentum of the Rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; EMG; paradoxical sleep; REM sleep; slow-wave sleep	PONTINE RETICULAR-FORMATION; BASAL FOREBRAIN NEURONS; FREELY MOVING CATS; C-FOS EXPRESSION; REM-SLEEP; PARADOXICAL SLEEP; CELL AREA; PEDUNCULOPONTINE NUCLEUS; MESOPONTINE TEGMENTUM; PROJECTING NEURONS	Distributed within the laterodorsal tegmental and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT and PPT), cholinergic neurons in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum have long been thought to play a critical role in stimulating cortical activation during waking (W) and paradoxical sleep (PS, also called REM sleep), yet also in promoting PS with muscle atonia. However, the discharge profile and thus precise roles of the cholinergic neurons have remained uncertain because they lie intermingled with GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, which might also assume these roles. By applying juxtacellular recording and labeling in naturally sleeping-waking, head-fixed rats, we investigated the discharge profiles of histochemically identified cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons in the LDT, SubLDT, and adjoining medial part of the PPT (MPPT) in relation to sleep-wake states, cortical activity, and muscle tone. We found that all cholinergic neurons were maximally active duringWand PS in positive correlation with fast (gamma) cortical activity, as "W/PS-max active neurons." Like cholinergic neurons, many GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons were also "W/PS-max active." Other GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons were "PS-max active," being minimally active duringWand maximally active during PS in negative correlation with muscle tone. Conversely, some glutamatergic neurons were "W-max active," being maximally active duringWand minimally active during PS in positive correlation with muscle tone. Through different discharge profiles, the cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons of the LDT, SubLDT, andMPPTthus appear to play distinct roles in promotingWand PS with cortical activation, PS with muscle atonia, orWwith muscle tone.

J	Keita, L; Bedoin, N; Burack, JA; Lepore, F				Keieta, Luc; Bedoin, Nathalie; Burack, Jacob A.; Lepore, Franco			Switching between global and local levels: the level repetition effect and its hemispheric asymmetry	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						hemispheric asymetry; hierarchical stimuli; switching; level repetition; inhibition	SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; RESPONSE COMPETITION; EXPOSURE DURATION; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ATTENTION; STIMULUS; INTEGRATION; PRECEDENCE	The global level of hierarchical stimuli (Navon's stimuli) is typically processed quicker and better than the local level; further differential hemispheric dominance is described for local (left hemisphere, LH) and global (right hemisphere, RH) processing. However, neuroimaging and behavioral data indicate that stimulus category (letter or object) could modulate the hemispheric asymmetry for the local level processing. Besides, when the targets are unpredictably displayed at the global or local level, the participant has to switch between levels, and the magnitude of the switch cost increases with the number of repeated-level trials preceding the switch. The hemispheric asymmetries associated with level switching is an unresolved issue. LH areas may be involved in carrying over the target level information in case of level repetition. These areas may also largely participate in the processing of level-changed trials. Here we hypothesized that RH areas underly the inhibitory mechanism performed on the irrelevant level, as one of the components of the level switching process. In an experiment using a within-subject design, hierarchical stimuli were briefly presented either to the right or to the left visual field. 32 adults were instructed to identify the target at the global or local level. We assessed a possible RH dominance for the non-target level inhibition by varying the attentional demands through the manipulation of level repetitions (two or gour repeated-level trials before the switch). The behavioral data confirmed a LH specialization only for the local level processing of letter-based stimuli, and detrimental effect of increased level repetitions before a switch. Further, data provides evidence for a RH advantage in inhibiting the non-target level. Taken together, the data supports the notion of the existence of multiple mechanisms underlying level-switch effects.

Results: p75NTR mediates proliferation of brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) via its cleavage and release of an intracellular domain. Conclusion: p75NTR also regulates proliferation of BTICs. Significance: p75NTR is a potential target for the treatment of malignant gliomas. Malignant gliomas are highly invasive, proliferative, and resistant to treatment. Previously, we have shown that p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is a novel mediator of invasion of human glioma cells. However, the role of p75NTR in glioma proliferation is unknown. Here we used brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) and show that BTICs express neurotrophin receptors (p75NTR, TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) and their ligands (NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neurotrophin 3) and secrete NGF. Down-regulation of p75NTR significantly decreased proliferation of BTICs. Conversely, exogenouous NGF stimulated BTIC proliferation through - and -secretase-mediated p75NTR cleavage and release of its intracellular domain (ICD). In contrast, overexpression of the p75NTR ICD induced proliferation. Interestingly, inhibition of Trk signaling blocked NGF-stimulated BTIC proliferation and p75NTR cleavage, indicating a role of Trk in p75NTR signaling. Further, blocking p75NTR cleavage attenuated Akt activation in BTICs, suggesting role of Akt in p75NTR-mediated proliferation. We also found that p75NTR, -secretases, and the four subunits of the -secretase enzyme were elevated in glioblastoma multiformes patients. Importantly, the ICD of p75NTR was commonly found in malignant glioma patient specimens, suggesting that the receptor is activated and cleaved in patient tumors. These results suggest that p75NTR proteolysis is required for BTIC proliferation and is a novel potential clinical target.

Light Stimulates the Mouse Adrenal through a Retinohypothalamic Pathway Independent of an Effect on the Clock in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERIPHERAL CIRCADIAN OSCILLATORS; ACUTE REGULATORY PROTEIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; DEFICIENT MICE; SPLANCHNIC STIMULATION; HORMONE BIOSYNTHESIS; GOLDEN-HAMSTER; CHOLERA-TOXIN; RAT; GLUCOCORTICOIDS	The brain's master circadian pacemaker resides within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). SCN clock neurons are entrained to the day/night cycle via the retinohypothalamic tract and the SCN provides temporal information to the central nervous system and to peripheral organs that function as secondary oscillators. The SCN clock-cell network is thought to be the hypothalamic link between the retina and descending autonomic circuits to peripheral organs such as the adrenal gland, thereby entraining those organs to the day/night cycle. However, there are at least three different routes or mechanisms by which retinal signals transmitted to the hypothalamus may be conveyed to peripheral organs: 1) via retinal input to SCN clock neurons; 2) via retinal input to non-clock neurons in the SCN; or 3) via retinal input to hypothalamic regions neighboring the SCN. It is very well documented that light-induced responses of the SCN clock (i.e., clock gene expression, neural activity, and behavioral phase shifts) occur primarily during the subjective night. Thus to determine the role of the SCN clock in transmitting photic signals to descending autonomic circuits, we compared the phase dependency of light-evoked responses in the SCN and a peripheral oscillator, the adrenal gland. We observed light-evoked clock gene expression in the mouse adrenal throughout the subjective day and subjective night. Light also induced adrenal corticosterone secretion during both the subjective day and subjective night. The irradiance threshold for light-evoked adrenal responses was greater during the subjective day compared to the subjective night. These results suggest that retinohypothalamic signals may be relayed to the adrenal clock during the subjective day by a retinal pathway or cellular mechanism that is independent of an effect of light on the SCN neural clock network and thus may be important for the temporal integration of physiology and metabolism.

Cytogenetic Prognostication Within Medulloblastoma Subgroups	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article							NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR TRKC; CHILDHOOD MEDULLOBLASTOMA; BRAIN-TUMORS; MOLECULAR SUBGROUPS; RISK STRATIFICATION; PATHWAY ACTIVATION; OUTCOME PREDICTION; MYCN AMPLIFICATION; TP53 MUTATIONS; POOR-PROGNOSIS	Purpose Medulloblastoma comprises four distinct molecular subgroups: WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. Current medulloblastoma protocols stratify patients based on clinical features: patient age, metastatic stage, extent of resection, and histologic variant. Stark prognostic and genetic differences among the four subgroups suggest that subgroup-specific molecular biomarkers could improve patient prognostication. Patients and Methods Molecular biomarkers were identified from a discovery set of 673 medulloblastomas from 43 cities around the world. Combined risk stratification models were designed based on clinical and cytogenetic biomarkers identified by multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses. Identified biomarkers were tested using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on a nonoverlapping medulloblastoma tissue microarray (n = 453), with subsequent validation of the risk stratification models. Results Subgroup information improves the predictive accuracy of a multivariable survival model compared with clinical biomarkers alone. Most previously published cytogenetic biomarkers are only prognostic within a single medulloblastoma subgroup. Profiling six FISH biomarkers (GLI2, MYC, chromosome 11 [chr11], chr14, 17p, and 17q) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, we can reliably and reproducibly identify very low-risk and very high-risk patients within SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 medulloblastomas. Conclusion Combining subgroup and cytogenetic biomarkers with established clinical biomarkers substantially improves patient prognostication, even in the context of heterogeneous clinical therapies. The prognostic significance of most molecular biomarkers is restricted to a specific subgroup. We have identified a small panel of cytogenetic biomarkers that reliably identifies very high-risk and very low-risk groups of patients, making it an excellent tool for selecting patients for therapy intensification and therapy de-escalation in future clinical trials.

Pomalidomide alone or in combination with low-dose dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma: a randomized phase 2 study	BLOOD			English	Article							LENALIDOMIDE PLUS DEXAMETHASONE; THALIDOMIDE ANALOGS; II TRIALS; BORTEZOMIB; THERAPY; CC-4047; DRUGS; IMIDS; CELLS	This multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 2 study assessed the efficacy and safety of pomalidomide (POM) with/without low-dose dexamethasone (LoDEX) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Patients who had received >= 2 prior therapies (including lenalidomide [LEN] and bortezomib [BORT]) and had progressed within 60 days of their last therapy were randomized to POM (4 mg/day on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) with/without LoDEX (40 mg/week). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). In total, 221 patients (median 5 prior therapies, range 1-13) received POM+LoDEX(n = 113) or POM(n = 108). With a median follow-up of 14.2 months, median PFS was 4.2 and 2.7 months (hazard ratio = 0.68, P = .003), overall response rates (ORRs) were 33% and 18% (P = .013), median response duration was 8.3 and 10.7 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 16.5 and 13.6 months, respectively. Refractoriness to LEN, or resistance to both LEN and BORT, did not affect outcomes with POM+LoDEX (median PFS 3.8 months for both; ORRs 30% and 31%; and median OS 16 and 13.4 months). Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 41% (POM+LoDEX) and 48% (POM); no grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy was reported. POM+LoDEX was effective and generally well tolerated and provides an important new treatment option for RRMM patients who have received multiple prior therapies. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00833833.

To isolate the vascular effects associated with age, this study measured the response to a hypercapnic challenge using different imaging modalities in 19 young (3 months-old) and 13 old (24 months-old) Long-Evans rats. Intrinsic optical imaging was used to measure oxy (HbO), deoxy (HbR) and total (HbT) hemoglobin concentration changes, laser speckle for cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes, and MRI for the BOLD signal. Older rats had smaller HbO (41% smaller), HbT (50%) and CBF (34%) responses, but the temporal dynamics did not exhibit significant age differences. The ratio of CBV to CBF responses was also smaller in older adults, potentially indicating a change in the compliance of vessels. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Personality dimensions and deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) for treatment-resistant depression: A pilot trial on five-factor prediction of antidepressant response	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Major depression; Five-factor personality; Personality; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation	INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; MAJOR DEPRESSION; LONG-TERM; BIG 5; DSM-IV; METAANALYSIS; DISORDER; EFFICACY; RTMS; EXTROVERSION	Background: Prognostication is poor in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Personality traits, particularly extraversion and neuroticism, have attracted increasing attention for both trait- and state-dependent characteristics in predicting response to pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and more recently to therapeutic neuromodulation for MDD. The advent of deep rTMS (DTMS) allows stimulation of deeper cortical regions, and we aimed to prospectively characterize personality dimensions and antidepressant response to DTMS in treatment-resistant MDD. Methods: A convenience sample of 15 patients with treatment-resistant MDD received four weeks of daily sessions of DTMS (20 Hz, 3000 pulses/session) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC). At baseline and at the conclusion of treatment, patients completed the Big Five Inventory, a five-factor assessment of major personality dimensions. Clinical response was measured using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Results: Four weeks of DTMS treatment were not associated with changes in personality measures. Clinical remission was associated with higher baseline levels of agreeableness (score >= 29:100% sensitive and 72.7% specific) and conscientiousness (score >= 30:75% sensitive and 81.8% specific). Levels of agreeableness and extraversion were linearly associated with antidepressant response. Neuroticism was not associated with the antidepressant effects of DTMS in this cohort. Conclusions: Five-factor personality assessment may have prognostic value in DTMS for resistant MDD. Agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness are associated with decreases in depressive symptoms during treatment with DTMS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Blain-Briere, B; Bouchard, C; Bigras, N				Blain-Briere, Benedicte; Bouchard, Caroline; Bigras, Nathalie			The role of executive functions in the pragmatic skills of children age 4-5	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						pragmatic skills; communication; executive functions; vocabulary; visuoconstructive abilities; cognitive development; language acquisition; early childhood	WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; YOUNG-CHILDREN; BRAIN-INJURY; COMMUNICATION; COMPREHENSION; ATTENTION	Several studies suggest that pragmatic skills (PS) (i.e., social communication) deficits may be linked to executive dysfunction (i.e., cognitive processes required for the regulation of new and complex behaviors) in patients with frontal brain injuries. If impairment of executive functions (EF) causes PS deficits in otherwise healthy adults, could this mean that EF are necessary for the normal functioning of PS, even more so than cognitive maturation? If so, children with highly developed EF should exhibit higher levels of PS. This study aimed to examine the link between EF and PS among normally developing children. A secondary goal was to compare this relationship to that between intellectual quotient (IQ) and PS in order to determine which predictor explained the most variance. Participants were 70 French-speaking preschool children (3;10-5;7 years old). The PS coding system, an observational tool developed for this study, was used to codify the children's PS during a semi-structured conversation with a research assistant. Five types of EF processes were evaluated: self-control, inhibition, flexibility, working memory and planning. IQ was estimated by tallying the scores on a receptive vocabulary test and a visuoconstructive abilities test. The results of the test of differences between correlation coefficients suggest that EF contributed significantly more than IQ to the PS exhibited by preschoolers during conversation. More specifically, higher inhibition skills were correlated with a decrease in talkativeness and assertiveness. EF also appeared to foster quality of speech by promoting the ability to produce fluid utterances, free of unnecessary repetition or hesitation. Moreover, children with a high working memory capacity were more likely to formulate contingent answers and produce utterances that could be clearly understood by the interlocutor. Overall, these findings help us better understand how EF may assist children in everyday social interactions.

Although opioids are generally associated only with the control of pain, here we report that the opioid system in fact broadly regulates cutaneous mechanosensation, including touch. This function is predominantly subserved by the delta opioid receptor (DOR), which is expressed by myelinated mechanoreceptors that form Meissner corpuscles, Merkel cell-neurite complexes, and circumferential hair follicle endings. These afferents also include a small population of CGRP-expressing myelinated nociceptors that we now identify as the somatosensory neurons that coexpress mu and delta opioid receptors. We further demonstrate that DOR activation at the central terminals of myelinated mechanoreceptors depresses synaptic input to the spinal dorsal horn, via the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. Collectively our results uncover a molecular mechanism by which opioids modulate cutaneous mechanosensation and provide a rationale for targeting DOR to alleviate injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.

J	Thura, D; Cisek, P				Thura, David; Cisek, Paul			Deliberation and Commitment in the Premotor and Primary Motor Cortex during Dynamic Decision Making	NEURON			English	Article							PERCEPTUAL DECISION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; INTERNAL GENERATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; INTRAPARIETAL AREA; PARIETAL CORTEX; EYE FIELDS	Neurophysiological studies of decision making have primarily focused on decisions about information that is stable over time. However, during natural behavior, animals make decisions in a constantly changing environment. To investigate the neural mechanisms of such dynamic choices, we recorded activity in dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor cortex (M1) while monkeys performed a two-choice reaching task in which sensory information about the correct choice was changing within each trial and the decision could be made at any time. During deliberation, activity in both areas did not integrate sensory information but instead tracked it and combined it with a growing urgency signal. Approximately 280 ms before movement onset, PMd activity tuned to the selected target reached a consistent peak while M1 activity tuned to the unselected target was suppressed. We propose that this reflects the resolution of a competition between the potential responses and constitutes the volitional commitment to an action choice.

Is there evidence for neurodegenerative change following traumatic brain injury in children and youth? A scoping review	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						traumatic brain injury; neurodegeneration; magnetic resonance imaging	SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; HEAD-INJURY; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SEQUELAE; MRI FINDINGS; MODERATE; CHILDHOOD; ATROPHY; ENCEPHALOPATHY; ADOLESCENTS	While generalized cerebral atrophy and neurodegenerative change following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is well recognized in adults, it remains comparatively understudied in the pediatric population, suggesting that research should address the potential for neurodegenerative change in children and youth following TBI. This focused review examines original research findings documenting evidence for neurodegenerative change following TBI of all severities in children and youth. Our relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria identified a total of 16 articles for review. Taken together, the studies reviewed suggest there is evidence for long-term neurodegenerative change following TBI in children and youth. In particular both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies revealed volume loss in selected brain regions including the hippocampus, amygdala, globus pallidus, thalamus, periventricular white matter, cerebellum, and brain stem as well as overall decreased whole brain volume and increased CSF and ventricular space. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies also report evidence for decreased cellular integrity, particularly in the corpus callosum. Sensitivity of the hippocampus and deep limbic structures in pediatric populations are similar to findings in the adult literature and we consider the data supporting these changes as well as the need to investigate the possibility of neurodegenerative onset in childhood associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).

Using behavioral measures and event-related potentials (N400) we evaluated the quality of the memory trace for targets taken from perceived temporal groups (TGs) of three and four items. Variations in the amplitude of the N400 showed a better memory trace for items presented in TGs of three compared to those in groups of four. Analyses of behavioral responses along with P300 components also revealed effects of chunk position in the utterance. This is the first study to measure the online effects of perceptual chunks on the memory trace of spoken items. Taken together, the N400 and P300 responses demonstrate that the perceptual chunking of speech facilitates information buffering and a processing on a chunk-by-chunk basis.

We measured Mn concentrations in repeated blood and hair samples collected from 449 pregnant women living near banana plantations with extensive aerial spraying of Mn-containing fungicide mancozeb in Costa Rica, and examined environmental and lifestyle factors associated with these biomarkers. Mean blood Mn and geometric mean hair Mn concentrations were 24.4 mu g/L (8.9-56.3) and 1.8 mu g/g (0.05-53.3), respectively. Blood Mn concentrations were positively associated with gestational age at sampling (beta = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.2), number of household members (beta = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.6), and living in a house made of permeable and difficult-to-clean materials (beta = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3 to 4.0); and inversely related to smoking (beta = 3.1; 95% CI: 5.8 to 0.3). Hair Mn concentrations were inversely associated with gestational age at sampling (% change = 0.8; 95% CI: -1.6 to 0.0); and positively associated with living within SO m of a plantation (% change = 42.1; 95% CI: 14.2 to 76.9) and Mn concentrations in drinking water (% change = 17.5; 95% CI: 12.2 to 22.8). Our findings suggest that pregnant women living near banana plantations aerially sprayed with mancozeb may be environmentally exposed to Mn.

Nevertheless, music is ranked among the highest sources of pleasure [3], and its important role in our society and culture has led to the assumption that the ability of music to induce pleasure is universal. However, this assumption has never been empirically tested. In the present report, we identified a group of healthy individuals without depression or generalized anhedonia who showed reduced behavioral pleasure ratings and no autonomic responses to pleasurable music, despite having normal musical perception capacities. These persons showed preserved behavioral and physiological responses to monetary reward, indicating that the low sensitivity to music was not due to a global hypofunction of the reward network. These results point to the existence of specific musical anhedonia and suggest that there may be individual differences in access to the reward system.

Endocannabinoids Promote Cocaine-Induced Impulsivity and Its Rapid Dopaminergic Correlates	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						CB1 receptors; cocaine; decision-making; dopamine; fast-scan cyclic voltammetry; self-control	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; CANNABINOID RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; PRESYNAPTIC INHIBITION; DECISION-MAKING; DRUG-ADDICTION; CB1 RECEPTORS; ENDOGENOUS CANNABINOIDS; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE	Background: Impaired decision making, a hallmark of addiction, is hypothesized to arise from maladaptive plasticity in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. The endocannabinoid system modulates dopamine activity through activation of cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). Here, we investigated whether impulsive behavior observed following cocaine exposure requires CB1R activation. Methods: We trained rats in a delay-discounting task. Following acquisition of stable performance, rats were exposed to cocaine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) every other day for 14 days and locomotor activity was measured. Two days later, delay-discounting performance was re-evaluated. To assess reversal of impulsivity, injections of a CB1R antagonist (1.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or vehicle were given 30 minutes before the task. During the second experiment, aimed at preventing impulsivity rather than reversing it, CB1Rs were antagonized before each cocaine injection. In this experimen Results: Blockade of CB1Rs reversed and prevented cocaine-induced impulsivity. Electrochemical results showed that during baseline and following disruption of endocannabinoid signaling, there was a robust increase in dopamine for immediate large rewards compared with immediate small rewards, but this effect reversed when the delay for the large reward was 10 seconds. In contrast, dopamine release always increased for one-pellet options at minimal or moderate delays in vehicle-treated rats. Conclusions: Endocannabinoids play a critical role in changes associated with cocaine exposure. Cannabinoid type 1 receptor blockade may thus counteract maladaptive alterations in afferents to dopamine neurons, thereby preventing changes in dopaminergic activity underlying a loss of self-control.

Recent research associated frequent video game playing with improvements in cognitive functions. Improvements in cognition have been related to grey matter changes in prefrontal cortex. However, a fine-grained analysis of human brain structure in relation to video gaming is lacking. In magnetic resonance imaging scans of 152 14-year old adolescents, FreeSurfer was used to estimate cortical thickness. Cortical thickness across the whole cortical surface was correlated with self-reported duration of video gaming (hours per week). A robust positive association between cortical thickness and video gaming duration was observed in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left frontal eye fields (FEFs). No regions showed cortical thinning in association with video gaming frequency. DLPFC is the core correlate of executive control and strategic planning which in turn are essential cognitive domains for successful video gaming. The FEFs are a key region involved in visuo-motor integration important for programming and execution of eye movements and allocation of visuo-spatial attention, processes engaged extensively in video games.

Structural hippocampal anomalies in a schizophrenia population correlate with navigation performance on a wayfinding task	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						psychiatric population; VBM; allocentric strategy; episodic memory; spatial memory; hippocampus	CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; MEMORY DEFICITS; SPATIAL MEMORY; RATING-SCALE; VIRTUAL TOWN; BRAIN; ABNORMALITIES; NETWORK; SIZE; STRATEGIES	Episodic memory, related to the hippocampus, has been found to be impaired in schizophrenia. Further, hippocampal anomalies have also been observed in schizophrenia. This study investigated whether average hippocampal gray matter (GM) would differentiate performance on a hippocampus-dependent memory task in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Twenty-one patients with schizophrenia and 22 control participants were scanned with an MRI while being tested on a wayfinding task in a virtual town (e.g., find the grocery store from the school). Regressions were performed for both groups individually and together using GM and performance on the wayfinding task. Results indicate that controls successfully completed the task more often than patients, took less time, and made fewer errors. Additionally, controls had significantly more hippocampal GM than patients. Poor performance was associated with a GM decrease in the right hippocampus for both groups. Within group regressions found an association between right hippocampi GM and performance in controls and an association between the left hippocampi GM and performance in patients. A second analysis revealed that different anatomical GM regions, known to be associated with the hippocampus, such as the parahippocampal cortex, amygdala, medial, and orbital prefrontal cortices, covaried with the hippocampus in the control group. Interestingly, the cuneus and cingulate gyrus also covaried with the hippocampus in the patient group but the orbital frontal cortex did not, supporting the hypothesis of impaired connectivity between the hippocampus and the frontal cortex in schizophrenia. These results present important implications for creating intervention programs aimed at measuring functional and structural changes in the hippocampus in schizophrenia.

A RAT KNOCKOUT MODEL IMPLICATES TRPC4 IN VISCERAL PAIN SENSATION	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transposon; gene knockout; gastrointestinal tract; somatic pain; morphine alternatives; colon	CHANNELS; RECEPTOR; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; MOUSE; TRPA1; CALCIUM; SYSTEM; DRUGS	Acute and chronic pain resulting from injury, surgery, or disease afflicts >100 million Americans each year, having a severe impact on mood, mental health, and quality of life. The lack of structural and functional information for most ion channels, many of which play key roles in the detection and transmission of noxious stimuli, means that there remain unidentified therapeutic targets for pain management. This study focuses on the transient receptor potential canonical subfamily 4 (TRPC4) ion channel, which is involved in the tissue-specific and stimulus-dependent regulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Rats with a transposon-mediated TRPC4-knockout mutation displayed tolerance to visceral pain induced by colonic mustard oil (MO) exposure, but not somatic or neuropathic pain stimuli. Moreover, wild-type rats treated with a selective TRPC4 antagonist (ML-204) prior to MO exposure mimicked the behavioral responses observed in TRPC4-knockout rats. Significantly, ML-204 inhibited visceral pain-related behavior in a dose-dependent manner without noticeable adverse effects. These data provide evidence that TRPC4 is required for detection and/or transmission of colonic MO visceral pain sensation. In the future, inhibitors of TRPC4 signaling may provide a highly promising path for the development of first-in-class therapeutics for this visceral pain, which may have fewer side effects and less addictive potential than opioid derivatives.

Low-energy ES prevents tissue damage and loss of specificity. Hence to identify optimal stimulation-current waveforms is a relevant problem, whose solution may have significant impact on the related medical (e. g. minimized side-effects) and engineering (e. g. maximized battery-life) efficiency. This has typically been addressed by simulation (of a given excitable-tissue model) and iterative numerical optimization with hard discontinuous constraints - e.g. AP's are all-or-none phenomena. Such approach is computationally expensive, while the solution is uncertain - e. g. may converge to local-only energy-minima and be model-specific. We exploit the Least-Action Principle (LAP). First, we derive in closed form the general template of the membrane-potential's temporal trajectory, which minimizes the ES energy integral over time and over any space-clamp ionic current model. From the given model we then obtain the specific energy-efficient current waveform, which is demonstrated to be globally optimal. The solution is model-independent by construction. We illustrate the approach by a broad set of example situations with some of the most popular ionic current models from the literature. The proposed approach may result in the significant improvement of solution efficiency: cumbersome and uncertain iteration is replaced by a single quadrature of a system of ordinary differential equations. The approach is further validated by enabling a general comparison to the conventional simulation and optimization results from the literature, including one of our own, based on finite-horizon optimal control. Applying the LAP also resulted in a number of general ES optimality principles. One such succinct observation is that ES with long pulse durations is much more sensitive to the pulse's shape whereas a rectangular pulse is most frequently optimal for short pulse durations.

In Drosophila, myoblast fusion involves the activation of the Rac pathway by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Myoblast City and its scaffolding protein ELMO, downstream of cell-surface cell-adhesion receptors. We previously showed that the mammalian ortholog of Myoblast City, DOCK1, functions in an evolutionarily conserved manner to promote myoblast fusion in mice. In search for regulators of myoblast fusion, we identified the G-protein coupled receptor brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI3) as a cell surface protein that interacts with ELMO. In cultured cells, BAI3 or ELMO1/2 loss of function severely impaired myoblast fusion without affecting differentiation and cannot be rescued by reexpression of BAI3 mutants deficient in ELMO binding. The related BAI protein family member, BAI1, is functionally distinct from BAI3, because it cannot rescue the myoblast fusion defects caused by the loss of BAI3 function. Finally, embryonic muscle precursor expression of a BAI3 mutant unable to bind ELMO was sufficient to block myoblast fusion in vivo. Collectively, our findings provide a role for BAI3 in the relay of extracellular fusion signals to their intracellular effectors, identifying it as an essential transmembrane protein for embryonic vertebrate myoblast fusion.

However, some patients with noncodeleted tumors also benefited from CRT; survival curves separated after the median had been reached, and significantly more patients lived 10 years after CRT than RT. Thus, 1p/19q status may not identify all responders to CRT. Patients and Methods Using trial data, we inquired whether an IDH mutation or germ-line polymorphism associated with IDH-mutant gliomas identified the patients in RTOG 9402 who benefited from CRT. ResultsIDH status was evaluable in 210 of 291 patients; 156 (74%) had mutations. rs55705857 was evaluable in 245 patients; 76 (31%) carried the G risk allele. Both were associated with longer progression-free survival after CRT, and mutant IDH was associated with longer overall survival (9.4 v 5.7 years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.86; P = .006). For those with wild-type tumors, CRT did not prolong median survival (1.3 v 1.8 years; HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.63 to 2.04; P = .67) or 10-year survival rate (CRT, 6% v RT, 4%). Patients with codeleted mutated tumors (14.7 v 6.8 years; HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.85; P = .01) and noncodeleted mutated tumors (5.5 v 3.3 years; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.99; P < .05) lived longer after CRT than RT. ConclusionIDH mutational status identified patients with oligodendroglial tumors who did (and did not) benefit from alkylating-agent chemotherapy with RT. Although patients with codeleted tumors lived longest, patients with noncodeleted IDH-mutated tumors also lived longer after CRT.	[Cairncross, J.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alcohol-dependence; emotion; vision; orbitofrontal cortex; amygdala; magnocellular pathways; dorsal visual stream	TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; HUMAN BRAIN; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; NEURAL EVIDENCE; FEARFUL FACES; PERCEPTION; AMYGDALA	Emotional visual perception deficits constitute a major problem in alcohol-dependence. Indeed, the ability to assess the affective content of external cues is a key adaptive function, as it allows on the one hand the processing of potentially threatening or advantageous stimuli, and on the other hand the establishment of appropriate social interactions (by enabling rapid decoding of the affective state of others from their facial expressions). While such deficits have been classically considered as reflecting a genuine emotion decoding impairment in alcohol-dependence, converging evidence suggests that underlying visual deficits might play a role in emotional alterations. This hypothesis appears to be relevant especially as data from healthy populations indicate that a coarse but fast analysis of visual inputs would allow emotional processing to arise from early stages of perception. After reviewing those findings and the associated models, the present paper underlines data showing that rapid interactions between emotion and vision could be impaired in alcohol-dependence and provides new research avenues that may ultimately offer a better understanding of the roots of emotional deficits in this pathological state.

Recently, a role for anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) in SuS has been proposed. Objectives: To report the clinical and paraclinical findings in the largest single series of patients so far and to investigate the frequency, titers, and clinical relevance of AECA in SuS. Patients and methods: A total of 107 serum samples from 20 patients with definite SuS, 5 with abortive forms of SuS (all with BRAO), and 70 controls were tested for AECA by immunohistochemistry employing primate brain tissue sections. Results: IgG-AECA >1:100 were detected in 25% (5/20) of patients with definite SuS and in 4.3% (3/70) of the controls. Median titers were significantly higher in SuS (1:3200, range 1:100 to 1:17500) than in controls (1:100, range 1:10 to 1:320); IgG-AECA titers >1:320 were exclusively present in patients with SuS; three controls had very low titers (1:10). Follow-up samples (n=4) from a seropositive SuS patient obtained over a period of 29 months remained positive at high titers. In all seropositive cases, AECA belonged to the complement-activating IgG1 subclass. All but one of the IgG-AECA-positive samples were positive also for IgA-AECA and 45% for IgM-AECA. SuS took a severe and relapsing course in most patients and was associated with bilateral visual and hearing impairment, a broad panel of neurological and neuropsychological symptoms, and brain atrophy in the majority of cases. Seropositive and seronegative patients did not differ with regard to any of the clinical or paraclinical parameters analyzed. Conclusions: SuS took a severe and protracted course in the present cohort, resulting in significant impairment. Our finding of high-titer IgG1 and IgM AECA in some patients suggest that humoral autoimmunity targeting the microvasculature may play a role in the pathogenesis of SuS, at least in a subset of patients. Further studies are warranted to define the exact target structures of AECA in SuS.

Pain is common in pancreatic cancer patients with 70%-80% suffering substantial pain. Celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is a technique that can potentially improve pain control in pancreatic cancer while preventing further escalation of opioid consumption. CPN is performed by injecting absolute alcohol into the celiac plexus neural network of ganglia. This review sets out to explore the current status of CPN in non-resectable pancreatic cancer. We will examine: (1) the efficacy and safety of percutaneous-CPN and endoscopic ultrasound guided-CPN; (2) specific technique modifications including bilateral (vs central) injections and celiac ganglia neurolysis; and (3) the issue of CPN timing, early at pancreatic cancer diagnosis vs traditional late use as salvage therapy.

INVOLVEMENT OF CANNABINOID RECEPTORS IN PERIPHERAL AND SPINAL MORPHINE ANALGESIA	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cannabinoid receptors; mu opioid receptors (MOP); morphine; pain; tail-flick test; formalin test	MU-OPIOID-RECEPTOR; CB1 RECEPTOR; FORMALIN TEST; MICE LACKING; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; MEDIATED ANTIHYPERALGESIA; 2-ARACHIDONOYL GLYCEROL; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SAPHENOUS NERVE	The interactions between the cannabinoid and opioid systems for pain modulation are reciprocal. However, the role and the importance of the cannabinoid system in the antinociceptive effects of opioids remain uncertain. We studied these interactions with the goal of highlighting the involvement of the cannabinoid system in morphineinduced analgesia. In both phases of the formalin test, intra paw and intrathecal morphine produced similar antinociceptive effects in C57BL/6, cannabinoid type 1 and type 2 receptor wild-type (respectively cnr1WT and cnr2WT) mice. In cnr1 and cnr2 knockout (KO) mice, at the dose used the antinociceptive effect of intra paw morphine in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test was decreased by 87% and 76%, respectively. Similarly, the antinociceptive effect of 0.1 mu g spinal morphine in the inflammatory phase was abolished in cnr1KO mice and decreased by 90% in cnr2KO mice. Interestingly, the antinociceptive effect of morphine in the acute phase of the formalin test was only reduced in cnr1KO mice. Notably, systemic morphine administration produced similar analgesia in all genotypes, in both the formalin and the hot water immersion tail-flick tests. Because the pattern of expression of the mu opioid receptor (MOP), its binding properties and its G protein coupling remained unchanged across genotypes, it is unlikely that the loss of morphine analgesia in the cnr1KO and cnr2KO mice is the consequence of MOP malfunction or downregulation due to the absence of its heterodimerization with either the CB1 or the CB2 receptors, at least at the level of the spinal cord.

Prior work has revealed that social judgments of faces are determined by facial features that vary on two orthogonal dimensions: trustworthiness and dominance. We conducted two experiments to investigate the visual information subtending trustworthiness and dominance judgments. In Experiment 1, we used the Bubbles technique to identify the facial areas and the spatial frequencies that modulate these two judgments. Our results show that the eye and mouth areas in high-to-medium spatial frequency bands were positively correlated with judgments of trustworthiness; the eyebrows region in medium-to-low frequency bands was positively correlated with judgments of dominance; and the lower left jawbone in medium-to-low frequency bands was negatively correlated with judgments of dominance. In Experiment 2, we used the results of Experiment 1 to induce subtle variations in the relative contrast of different facial areas, and showed that it is possible to rig social perception using such a manipulation.

The pharmacophore corresponds to beta-turns of the neurotrophin polypeptides neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), nerve growth factor (NGF), or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These are the natural ligands for TrkC, TrkA, and TrkB receptors, respectively. The linker length and the side-chain orientation of each monomer within the bivalent mimics were systematically altered, and the impact of these changes on the function of each ligand was evaluated. While the monovalent peptidomimetics had no detectable binding or bioactivity, four bivalent peptidomimetics (2c, 2d, 2e, 3f) are selective TrkC ligands with antagonistic activity, and two bivalent peptidomimetics (1a, 1b) are TrkC and TrkA ligands with antagonistic activity. All these bivalent compounds block ligand-dependent receptor activation and cell survival, without affecting neuritogenic differentiation. This work adds to our understanding of how the neurotrophins function through Trk receptors, and demonstrates that peptidomimetics can be designed to selectively disturb specific biological signals, and may be used as pharmacological probes or as therapeutic leads. The concept of altering side-chain, linker length, and sequence orientation of a subunit within a pharmacophore provides an easy modular approach to generate larger libraries with diversified bioactivity.

Orientation tuning in human colour vision at detection threshold	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; PROBABILITY SUMMATION; PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION; DETECTION MECHANISMS; CONTRAST DETECTION; SELECTIVITY; LUMINANCE; MASKING; GRATINGS; MODEL	We measure the orientation tuning of red-green colour and luminance vision at low (0.375 c/deg) and mid (1.5 c/deg) spatial frequencies using the low-contrast psychophysical method of subthreshold summation. Orientation bandwidths of the underlying neural detectors are found using a model involving Minkowski summation of the rectified outputs of a bank of oriented filters. At 1.5 c/deg, we find orientation-tuned detectors with similar bandwidths for chromatic and achromatic contrast. At 0.375 c/deg, orientation tuning is preserved with no change in bandwidth for achromatic stimuli, however, for chromatic stimuli orientation tuning becomes extremely broad, compatible with detection by non-oriented colour detectors. A non-oriented colour detector, previously reported in single cells in primate V1 but not psychophysically in humans, can transmit crucial information about the color of larger areas or surfaces whereas orientation-tuned detectors are required to detect the colour or luminance edges that delineate an object's shape.

Inducing high tensile residual stress is a critical problem during the machining of Inconel718. This problem becomes more detrimental in presence of rough machined surface because fatigue life of the manufactured components might be decreased significantly. The aim of the present study is to access desired machining parameters including cutting speed, depth of cut, and feed rate for simultaneous optimizing surface roughness and tensile residual stress in the finish turning of Inconel718. After conducting experimental measurements, the results were introduced to the artificial neural networks. Then, the functions implemented by neural networks were defined as objective functions of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. Finally, it was shown that implemented hybrid technique provides a robust framework for machining of Inconel718 superalloy.

Here we provide evidence that tumor dormancy is influenced by tissue factor (TF), the cancer cell-associated initiator of the coagulation system and a signaling receptor. Thus, indolent human glioma cells deficient for TF remain viable but permanently dormant at the injection site for nearly a year, whereas the expression of TF leads to a step-wise transition to latent and overt tumor growth phases, a process that is preceded by recruitment of vascular (CD105(+)) and myeloid (CD11b(+) and F4/80(+)) cells. Importantly, the microenvironment orchestrated by TF expression drives permanent changes in the phenotype, gene-expression profile, DNA copy number, and DNA methylation state of the tumor cells that escape from dormancy. We postulate that procoagulant events in the tissue microenvironment (niche) may affect the fate of occult tumor cells, including their biological and genetic progression to initiate a full-blown malignancy.

Oxytocin and enhancement of the positive valence of social affiliation memories: An autobiographical memory study	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Intranasal oxytocin; Dose-response; Autobiographical memory; Social affiliation; Positive; Overgeneral	TEND-AND-BEFRIEND; INTRANASAL OXYTOCIN; PLASMA OXYTOCIN; INCREASES TRUST; RESEARCH TOOLS; HUMAN BRAIN; VASOPRESSIN; DEPRESSION; STRESS; HUMANS	Intranasal oxytocin has been shown to alter self-perceptions of personality (e.g., more trusting, increased extraversion). To follow up these findings, we examined the acute effects of two doses of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU and 48 IU) on another form of self-referential cognition: autobiographical memory. Changes in autobiographical memory (personal memories for the past) could conceivably effect change in self-perception and consequently alter social behaviors. We predicted that oxytocin would increase the number of specific personal memories recalled, and promote the recall of positive social affiliation memories. Seventeen male participants self-administered a placebo or oxytocin (24 IU, 48 IU) using a nasal spray on three separate occasions in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, and within-subject experiment. Participants completed the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT) 110 minutes later. Analyses revealed a quadratic dose-response curve for the effects of intranasal oxytocin on autobiographical memory recall. The 24 IU dose, relative to the 48 IU dose and placebo, increased the number of specific personal memories recalled and promoted the recall of social affiliation memories that were rated more positively. The lack of effect with the 48 IU dose could be due to saturation of the oxytocin receptors at higher doses. Changes in autobiographical memory may be one mechanism by which oxytocin alters prosocial worldviews.

Even though they are the safest way to transport petroleum products, pipelines do still fail generating hazardous consequences and irreparable environmental damages. Many models have been developed in the last decade to predict pipeline failures and conditions. However, most of these models were limited to one failure type, such as corrosion failure, or relied mainly on expert opinion analysis. The objective of this paper is to develop a model that predicts the failure cause of oil pipelines based on factors other than corrosion. Two models are developed to help decision makers predict failure occurrence. Regression analysis and artificial neural networks (ANNs) models were developed based on historical data of pipeline accidents. The two models were able to satisfactory predict pipeline failures due to mechanical, operational, corrosion, third party and natural hazards with an average validity of 90% for the regression model and 92% for the ANN model. The developed models assist decision makers and pipeline operators to predict the expected failure cause(s) and to take the necessary actions to avoid them.

In particular, this protocol focuses on how to image dividing neuroblasts, which are found underneath the epidermal cells and may be important for epidermal morphogenesis. Tissue formation is crucial for metazoan development and relies on external cues from neighboring tissues. C. elegans is an excellent model organism to study tissue morphogenesis in vivo due to its transparency and simple organization, making its tissues easy to study via microscopy. Ventral enclosure is the process where the ventral surface of the embryo is covered by a single layer of epithelial cells. This event is thought to be facilitated by the underlying neuroblasts, which provide chemical guidance cues to mediate migration of the overlying epithelial cells. However, the neuroblasts are highly proliferative and also may act as a mechanical substrate for the ventral epidermal cells. Studies using this experimental protocol could uncover the importance of intercellular communication during tissue formation, and could be used to reveal the roles of genes involved in cell division within developing tissues.

Methods: Retrospective chart review: The prevalence of glaucoma was determined in older adults with a diagnosis of DAT or mixed dementia (DAT with vascular contribution) admitted to the geriatric and neurology units of the Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal and the Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont between April 2008 and April 2009 (n=220; DAT group). They were matched for age and date of hospitalisation to the first 220 individuals without dementia (control group) recruited from other medical units in the same hospitals: gastroenterology, internal medicine or cardiology. A diagnosis of glaucoma was deemed positive if recorded in the chart or if there was a medication compatible with this diagnosis. Chi-square tests were used for between-group comparisons. Results: Subjects' age ranged from 66 to 101 years. The prevalence of glaucoma was 6.8% in our study population (n=30/440). Glaucoma was significantly more prevalent in the DAT group (n=21; 9.5%) than in the control group (n= 9: 4.1%) [chi(2)(1) = 5.15; p = 0.023]. Conclusions: The prevalence of glaucoma was higher in a group of older adults with DAT than in a comparable control group. These results underscore the importance of providing regular eyecare for persons affected by DAT.

Referrals, Wait Times and Diagnoses at an Urgent Neurology Clinic over 10 Years	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; OUTPATIENT REFERRALS; CARE	Background: An urgent neurology assessment clinic was created at our institution to improve access to prompt neurological assessment, and has been in operation for over a decade. We assessed its timeliness and impact. Methods: The clinic database was examined retrospectively for trends in the volume and waiting time to assessments, neurologic diagnoses, and whether neurologic assessment changed patients' diagnoses. Before and after implementation, the frequency of emergency department neurology assessments and hospital admissions for neurological investigation were compared. Results: In the first decade, 25145 referrals were received; 12460 patients were accepted and assessed within an average of 3.8 working days. The most common problems seen included headache and seizure (20.2% each). Overall, 44.6% of assessments resulted in a change to the referring diagnosis; this proportion varied by the type of problem seen (from 10.5% for seizures to 92.5% for psychiatric disturbances). From the pre- to post-opening periods, there were fewer emergency room neurological assessments (35.7% reduction) and fewer hospital admissions for neurological investigation (4.4/week to 2.2/week, 50% reduction). Conclusions: The urgent neurology clinic model at our institution has provided excellent service, including wait times of a few days, to a catchment of over two million Canadians for over a decade; clinic assessments have affected diagnoses and patient care.

We examined the distribution of site-specific metastases in patients with UCUB according to age and we assessed contemporary recommendations proposed by guidelines with regard to distant metastases. Methods: Patients with metastatic UCUB (mUCUB) were abstracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1998-2007). Age was stratified into quartiles: < 63, 64-72, 73-79 and >= 80 years. Cochran-Armitage trend test and multivariable logistic regression analysis tested the relationship between age and the rate of metastases. Finally, we identified patients at high risk of brain or bone metastases. Results: Within 7543 patients with mUCUB, 25%, 24%, 23%, 19%, 18% and 3% had lymph node, bone, urinary, lung and liver metastases, respectively. Overall, the rate of concomitant metastases was 29%. The rate of multiple metastatic sites decreased with increasing age (p < 0.001). This was confirmed in patients with lung, bone, liver, urinary system and brain metastases (all p <= 0.04). The rate of bone metastases was 15.0% in patients with exclusive abdominal metastases and 40.0% in patients with abdominal, thoracic and brain metastases. The rate of brain metastases was 1% in patients with exclusive abdominal metastases and 7% in patients with thoracic and bone metastases. Our findings are limited by the retrospective nature of the analyses. Conclusions: We report a higher number of concomitant metastatic sites in young UCUB patients. Bone metastases are frequent in all patient groups, whereas brain metastases are common in UCUB patients with thoracic and/or bone metastases.

To date, the clinical utility of 5-ALA in meningiomas is not fully understood, with most descriptive studies using qualitative approaches to 5-ALA-PpIX. OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic performance of 5-ALA-PpIX fluorescence during surgical resection of meningioma. METHODS: ALA was administered to 15 patients with meningioma undergoing PpIX fluorescence-guided surgery at our institution. At various points during the procedure, the surgeon performed qualitative, visual assessments of fluorescence by using the surgical microscope, followed by a quantitative fluorescence measurement by using an intra-operative probe. Specimens were collected at each point for subsequent neuropathological analysis. Clustered data analysis of variance was used to ascertain a difference between groups, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to assess diagnostic capabilities. RESULTS: Red-pink fluorescence was observed in 80% (12/15) of patients, with visible fluorescence generally demonstrating a strong, homogenous character. Quantitative fluorescence measured diagnostically significant PpIX concentrations (c(PpIx)) in both visibly and nonvisibly fluorescent tissues, with significantly higher c(PpIx) in both visibly fluorescent (P < .001) and tumor tissue (P = .002). Receiver operating characteristic analyses also showed diagnostic accuracies up to 90% for differentiating tumor from normal dura. CONCLUSION: ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence guidance is a potential and promising adjunct in accurately detecting neoplastic tissue during meningioma resective surgery. These results suggest a broader reach for PpIX as a biomarker for meningiomas than was previously noted in the literature.

The intricate branching of the vessels and furcations, however, make the task of understanding the spatial three-dimensional layout of these images challenging. In this paper, we present empirical studies on the effect of different perceptual cues (fog, pseudo-chromadepth, kinetic depth, and depicting edges) both individually and in combination on the depth perception of cerebral vascular volumes and compare these to the cue of stereopsis. Two experiments with novices and one experiment with experts were performed. The results with novices showed that the pseudo-chromadepth and fog cues were stronger cues than that of stereopsis. Furthermore, the addition of the stereopsis cue to the other cues did not improve relative depth perception in cerebral vascular volumes. In contrast to novices, the experts also performed well with the edge cue. In terms of both novice and expert subjects, pseudo-chromadepth and fog allow for the best relative depth perception. By using such cues to improve depth perception of cerebral vasculature, we may improve diagnosis, surgical planning, and intraoperative guidance.

Recent studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms regulate the activity of cortisol and GR. As a means to combine and cross-validate those findings, we compared cortisol, GR expression and promoter methylation levels in peripheral T lymphocytes of healthy controls versus individuals endorsing a diagnosis of lifetime PTSD. Thirty subjects with lifetime (current or remitted) PTSD and 16 subjects never exposed to trauma were recruited. Salivary cortisol was collected at six time points over the course of a single weekday and analyzed utilizing a time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. GR expression (GR(total), 1(B), 1(C), 1(F) and 1(H)) was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. DNA methylation levels in human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) 1(B) and 1(C) variant's promoter were quantified by epityper in T lymphocytes isolated by magnetic-assisted cell sorting. Individuals with lifetime PTSD have lower morning cortisol release, higher mRNA expression of hGR(total), 1(B), and 1(C) and lower overall methylation levels in hGR 1(B) and 1(C) promoters. Cortisol levels were inversely correlated with hGR 1B mRNA expression. Moreover, overall and CpG site-specific methylation levels were inversely correlated with hGRtotal and 1(B) mRNA expression. There was no difference between current and remitted PTSD across cortisol, GR expression mRNA and DNA methylation data. Traumatic events induce DNA methylation alterations in distinct promoters of hGR with transcriptional modifications that associate with hypoactive hypothalamus-pituitaryadrenal axis in individuals with PTSD. Our results also point toward an important role of hGR 1(B) variant in PTSD.

Aggressive behavior, a known psychological symptom following TBI, has been regarded as an obstacle toward rehabilitation. Having measures that accurately assess aggression during rehabilitation is critical toward proper evaluation. Objective: To undertake a systematic review of the validated scales used to assess aggression in the postacute stage (3 months) after sustaining a TBI in the adult population. A comprehensive search was performed and studies meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed in full. Quality and validity of supporting articles were assessed via the Downs and Black and QUADAS checklists along with their supporting statistics. Results: A total of 1329 articles were reviewed from the literature. Thirty-two were reviewed in detail and 6 studies eventually passed the exclusion criteria. Of these, 6 neuropsychological scales were represented pertaining to the measurement of aggressive behavior; however, only 1 directly addressed the validity of their scale's aggression component. Conclusions: Further research is required to establish the validity of scales that specifically address aggression for use in the adult TBI population which could be used to support rehabilitation and social reintegration strategies.

The classic neuroradiological picture mimics that of congenital infections in that Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome is characterized by leukoencephalopathy, brain atrophy and intracranial calcifications. To date, bilateral striatal necrosis has not been reported in patients with AGS. We report on two patients with clinical diagnosis of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome in which brain MRI and CT scans demonstrated bilateral striatal necrosis. The diagnosis of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome in these two patients was genetically confirmed after the recent discovery that mutations in the ADAR1 (AGS6) gene may cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome. This is the first report of bilateral striatal necrosis in association with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome. These results expand the neuroradiological phenotype of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome.

J	de Guinea, AO; Titah, R; Leger, PM				de Guinea, Ana Ortiz; Titah, Ryad; Leger, Pierre-Majorique			Explicit and Implicit Antecedents of Users' Behavioral Beliefs in Information Systems: A Neuropsychological Investigation	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						behavioral belief formation; cognitive beliefs; electroencephalography (EEG); emotion; IS acceptance; IS use; NeuroIS; nonlinear effects; TAM	TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; COGNITIVE LOAD; PERCEIVED USEFULNESS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; RESEARCH AGENDA; EEG; PERFORMANCE; ENGAGEMENT; TRUST	Behavioral beliefs-perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use-have been identified as the most influential antecedents of individuals' information systems use intentions and behaviors within the technology acceptance model. However, little research has been aimed at investigating the implicit (automatic or unconscious) determinants of such cognitive beliefs, and more importantly, the potential nonlinear relationships of such antecedents with explicit (perceptual) ones. As such, this paper theorizes that implicit neurophysiological states-memory load and distraction- and explicit-engagement and frustration-antecedents interact in the formation of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. To test the study's hypotheses, we conducted an experiment that measured neurophysiological states while individuals worked on instrumental and hedonic tasks using technology. The results show that, as theorized, implicit and explicit constructs interact together, and thus have a nonlinear effect on behavioral beliefs. Specifically, when engagement is high, neurophysiological distraction does not statistically significantly affect perceived usefulness, whereas when engagement is low, neurophysiological distraction has a negative and significant effect on usefulness. The results also show that when frustration is high, neurophysiological memory load has a negative effect on perceived ease of use, whereas when it is low, neurophysiological memory load has a positive effect on perceived ease of use. This study makes several contributions to acceptance research and the emerging field of NeuroIS, including demonstration of the importance of emotional perceptions for moderating the effects of neurophysiological states on behavioral beliefs.

For the most part, diagnosis of concussion is based on subjective clinical measures and thus is prone to under-reporting. In the current environment, where conventional imaging modalities, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are unable to elucidate the degree of white matter damage and neurometabolic change, a discussion of two advanced imaging techniquesdiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)is undertaken with a view to highlighting their potential utility. Our aim is to outline a variety of the approaches to concussion research that have been employed, with special attention given to the clinical considerations and acute complications attributed to concussive injury. DTI and MRS have been at the forefront of research as a result of their noninvasiveness and ease of acquisition, and hence it is thought that the use of these neuroimaging modalities has the potential to aid clinical decision making and management, including guiding return-to-play protocols.

J	Harvey, PO; Lepage, M				Harvey, Philippe-Olivier; Lepage, Martin			Neural correlates of recognition memory of social information in people with schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SELF-REFERENCE; EMOTIONAL VALENCE; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; COGNITION; METAANALYSIS; BRAIN; FMRI; AROUSAL; DEFICIT	Background: Social dysfunction is a hallmark characteristic of schizophrenia. Part of it may stem from an inability to efficiently encode social information into memory and retrieve it later. This study focused on whether patients with schizophrenia show a memory boost for socially relevant information and engage the same neural network as controls when processing social stimuli that were previously encoded into memory. Methods: Patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls performed a social and nonsocial picture recognition memory task while being scanned. We calculated memory performance using d'. Our main analysis focused on brain activity associated with recognition memory of social and nonsocial pictures. Results: Our study included 28 patients with schizophrenia and 26 controls. Healthy controls demonstrated a memory boost for socially relevant information. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia failed to show enhanced recognition sensitivity for social pictures. At the neural level, patients did not engage the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) as much as controls while recognizing social pictures. Limitations: Our study did not include direct measures of self-referential processing. All but 3 patients were taking antipsychotic medications, which may have altered both the behavioural performance during the picture recognition memory task and brain activity. Conclusion: Impaired social memory in patients with schizophrenia may be associated with altered DMPFC activity. A reduction of DMPFC activity may reflect less involvement of self-referential processes during memory retrieval. Our functional MRI results contribute to a better mapping of the neural disturbances associated with social memory impairment in patients with schizophrenia and may facilitate the development of innovative treatments, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Minimum Effective Volume of Combined Lidocaine-Bupivacaine for Analgesic Subparaneural Popliteal Sciatic Nerve Block	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							LOCAL-ANESTHETIC SPREAD; SUBGLUTEAL APPROACH; PARANEURAL SHEATH; DOWN DESIGN; ULTRASOUND; INJECTION; BIFURCATION; DIVISION; GUIDANCE; FOSSA	Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the minimum effective volume (MEV) of combined lidocaine 1.0%-bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL in 90% of patients (MEV90) for ultrasound-guided subparaneural popliteal sciatic nerve block. Methods: All subjects received an ultrasound-guided subparaneural popliteal sciatic nerve block (at the neural bifurcation) with combined lidocaine 1.0%-bupivacaine 0.25% and epinephrine 5 mu g/mL. Using an out-of-plane technique, a 17-gauge, 8-cm Tuohy needle was advanced until its tip was positioned between the tibial and peroneal nerves inside the paraneural sheath. Volume assignment was carried out using a biased coin design, up-and-down sequential method, where the volume of local anesthetic administered to each patient depended on the response of the previous one. In case of failure, the next subject received a higher volume (defined as the previous volume with an increment of 3.0 mL). If the previous patient had a successful block, the next subject was randomized to a lower volume (defined as the previous volume with a decrement of 3.0 mL), with a probability of b = 0.11, or the same volume, with a probability of 1 - b = 0.89. Using a composite scale encompassing sensory and motor block, success was defined, at 30 minutes, as a minimal score of 6 points (out of 8 points). The 6-point score was intended to mirror successful postoperative analgesia. Patients undergoing surgery of the leg, ankle, or foot were prospectively enrolled until 45 successful blocks were obtained. Results: Fifty-two patients were recruited for this study. Using isotonic regression and bootstrap confidence interval, the MEV90 of combined lidocaine 1.0%-bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL was estimated to be 13.3 mL (95% confidence interval, 10.2-16.4 mL). Conclusions: For ultrasound-guided subparaneural (analgesic) popliteal sciatic nerve block, the MEV90 of combined lidocaine 1.0%-bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL is 13.3 mL (95% confidence interval, 10.2-16.4 mL).

However, there is no evidence to date to suggest that these alterations occur in patients with ALF. We analyzed the mRNA expression of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT-1, EAAT-2), GFAP, and AQP-4 in the cerebral cortex obtained at autopsy from eight patients with ALF and from seven patients with no evidence of hepatic or neurological disorders by real-time PCR, and protein expression was assessed using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated a significant decrease in GFAP mRNA and protein levels in ALF patients compared to controls. While the loss of EAAT-2 protein in ALF samples was post-translational in nature, EAAT-1 protein remained within normal limits. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that, in all cases, the losses of EAAT-2 and GFAP were uniquely astrocytic in their localization. AQP-4 mRNA expression was significantly increased and its immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased AQP-4 immunoreactivity in the glial end-feet process surrounding the microvessels. These findings provide evidence of selective alterations in the expression of genes coding for key astrocytic proteins implicated in central nervous system (CNS) excitability and brain edema in human ALF. We investigated the gene expression of astrocytic proteins involved in astrocyte swelling causing brain edema in autopsied brain tissues of patients with acute liver failure. This study demonstrated loss of GFAP expression and up-regulation of AQP-4 protein expression leading to cerebral edema, and loss of EAAT-2 expression implicated in excitatory neurotransmission. These findings may provide new drug targets against CNS complications of acute liver failure.

J	Kovacs, K; Basu, K; Rouiller, I; Sik, A				Kovacs, Krisztina; Basu, Kaustuv; Rouiller, Isabelle; Sik, Attila			Regional differences in the expression of K+-Cl- 2 cotransporter in the developing rat cortex	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Development; Intracellular chloride homeostasis; KCC2; Neocortex; Paleocortex; Spine genesis; Inhibition	CATION-CHLORIDE COTRANSPORTERS; NEURONAL-SPECIFIC ISOFORM; INTRACELLULAR CHLORIDE; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IONIC BASIS; KCC2; GABA; MATURATION; NEUROGENESIS	The type 2 potassium-chloride cotransporter (KCC2) is the main regulator of intracellular chloride concentration in CNS neurons, and plays a crucial role in spine development that is independent of its ion cotransport function. The expression pattern of KCC2 is upregulated during postnatal development showing area and layer-specific differences in distinct brain areas. We examined the regional and ultrastructural localisation of KCC2 in various areas of developing neocortex and paleocortex during the first two postnatal weeks. Light-microscopy examination revealed diffuse neuropil and discrete funnel-shaped dendritic labelling in the piriform and entorhinal cortices at birth. Subsequently, during the beginning of the first postnatal week, diffuse KCC2 labelling gradually started to appear in the superficial layers of the neocortex while the punctate-like labelling of dendrites in the piriform, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices become more pronounced. By the end of the first postnatal week, discrete dendritic expression of KCC2 was visible in all neocortical and paleocortical areas. The expression level did not change during the second postnatal week suggesting that, in contrast to hippocampus, adult pattern of KCC2 in the cortical cells is already established by the end of the first postnatal week. Quantitative electron microscopy examination revealed that in superficial layers of both neo- and paleocortex, the majority of KCC2 signal was plasma membrane associated but the number of transport vesicle-associated immunosignal increased with development. In deep layers, KCC2 immunolabeling was evenly distributed in plasma membrane and transport vesicles showing no obvious change with maturation. The number of KCC2 immunogold particles increased in dendritic spines with no association with synapses. This observation points to the dual role of KCC2 in spine genesis and ion cotransport.

Simultaneous EEG-fNIRS recording allows the spatio-temporal reconstruction of the hemodynamic response in terms of the concentration changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) associated with recorded epileptic events such as interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) or seizures. While most previous studies investigating fNIRS in epilepsy had limitations due to restricted spatial coverage and small sample sizes, this work includes a sufficiently large number of channels to provide an extensive bilateral coverage of the surface of the brain for a sample size of 40 patients with focal epilepsies. Topographic maps of significant activations due to each IED type were generated in four different views (dorsal, frontal, left and right) and were compared with the epileptic focus previously identified by an epileptologist. After excluding 5 patients due to the absence of IEDs and 6 more with mesial temporal foci too deep for fNIRS, we report that significant HbR (respectively HbO) concentration changes corresponding to IEDs were observed in 62% (resp. 38%) of patients with neocortical epilepsies. This HbR/HbO response was most significant in the epileptic focus region among all the activations in 28%/21% of patients. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The data also provide strong evidence for the presence of multiple additional risk loci, each contributing a relatively small effect to BD susceptibility. Large samples are necessary to detect these risk loci. Here we present results from the largest BD GWAS to date by investigating 2.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample of 24,025 patients and controls. We detect 56 genome-wide significant SNPs in five chromosomal regions including previously reported risk loci ANK3, ODZ4 and TRANK1, as well as the risk locus ADCY2 (5p15.31) and a region between MIR2113 and POU3F2 (6q16.1). ADCY2 is a key enzyme in cAMP signalling and our finding provides new insights into the biological mechanisms involved in the development of BD.

Data Sources: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Registry, BIOSIS, and Trip Database up to February 2012 and consulted bibliographies of narrative reviews and selected articles. Study Selection: We included cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies and randomized trials enrolling at least five adults with blunt traumatic brain injury in whom at least one anterior pituitary axis was assessed. We excluded case series and studies in which other neurological conditions were indistinguishable from traumatic brain injury. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers selected citations, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using a standardized form. Data Synthesis: We performed meta-analyses using random effect models and assessed heterogeneity using the I-2 index. Results: We included 66 studies (5,386 patients) evaluating prevalence, 14 evaluating clinical outcomes, and 27 evaluating predictors. Thirty studies were at low risk of bias. Anterior pituitary disorders were associated with a trend toward increased ICU mortality (risk ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.99-3.21; four studies) and no difference in Glasgow Outcome Scale score (mean difference, -0.45; 95% CI, -1.10 to 0.20; three studies). Age (mean difference, 3.19; 95% CI, 0.31-6.08; 19 studies), traumatic brain injury severity (risk ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.20-3.86 for patients with severe vs nonsevere traumatic brain injury; seven studies), and skull fractures (risk ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.03-2.91; six studies) predicted anterior pituitary disorders. Over the long term, 31.6% (95% CI, 23.6-40.1%; 27 studies) of patients had at least one anterior pituitary disorder. We observed significant heterogeneity that was not solely explained by the risk of bias or traumatic brain injury severity. Conclusions: Approximately one third of traumatic brain injury patients have persistent anterior pituitary disorder. Older age, traumatic brain injury severity, and skull fractures predict anterior pituitary disorders, which in turn may be associated with higher ICU mortality. Further high-quality studies are warranted to better define the burden of anterior pituitary disorders and to identify high-risk patients.

Testing a Neurobiological Model of Depersonalization Disorder Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; Neuronavigation-guided TMS; Depersonalization disorder; Skin conductance responses; Prefrontal cortex; Temporal parietal cortex	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TEMPORO-PARIETAL JUNCTION; ILLICIT DRUG-USE; EMOTION; THERAPY; ANXIETY; BRAIN; RTMS; BODY; DEREALISATION	Background: Depersonalization disorder (DPD) includes changes in subjective experiencing of self, encompassing emotional numbing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has pointed to ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) inhibition of insula as a neurocognitive correlate of the disorder. Objective: We hypothesized that inhibition to right VLPFC using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) would lead to increased arousal and reduced symptoms. Methods: Patients with medication-resistant DSM-IV DPD (N = 17) and controls (N = 20) were randomized to receive one session of right-sided rTMS to VLPFC or temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). 1Hz rTMS was guided using neuronavigation and delivered for 15 min. Co-primary outcomes were: (a) maximum skin conductance capacity, and (b) reduction in depersonalization symptoms (Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale (CDS) [state version]). Secondary outcomes included spontaneous fluctuations (SFs) and event-related skin conductance responses. Results: In patients with DPD, rTMS to VLPFC led to increased electrodermal capacity, namely maximum skin conductance deflections. Patients but not controls also showed increased SFs post rTMS. Patients who had either VLPFC or TPJ rTMS showed a similar significant reduction in symptoms. Event-related electrodermal activity did not change. Conclusions: A single session of right-sided rTMS to VLPFC (but not TPJ) significantly increased physiological arousal capacity supporting our model regarding the relevance of increased VLPFC activity to emotional numbing in DPD. rTMS to both sites led to reduced depersonalization scores but since this was independent of physiological arousal, this may be a non-specific effect. TMS is a potential therapeutic option for DPD; modulation of VLPFC, if replicated, is a plausible mechanism. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Patients aged >= 50 years were followed prospectively for <= 6 months. Based on the duration of their episode at enrolment, cases were classified as incident (<7 days) or prevalent (>= 7 days). HZ pain and discomfort were measured with the HZ Severity of Illness (HZ-SOI) severity-by-duration composite score. Results: One hundred fifty-one patients (69.5% prevalent cases) were enrolled. Prodrome pain was experienced by 68.2% of patients, of whom 95.1% experienced moderate-to-severe pain; post-herpetic neuralgia was experienced by 38.4%. Prevalent disease, higher acute pain, and older age were significant predictors of greater HZ-SOI, while use of antivirals was associated with decreased HZ-SOI. HZassociated pain was associated with reduced QoL and affected all daily living activities (particularly mood, life enjoyment, general activities, and sleep), resulting in significant HCRU, including primary care doctor, specialist, or physiotherapist consultations, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits. Conclusion: Severe morbidity, impaired QoL, and significant HCRU are associated with HZ in South Korea, especially in older patients, supporting the need for early intervention and preventive strategies to reduce the HZ-associated disease burden.

Brain Volume and Fatigue in Patients With Postpoliomyelitis Syndrome	PM&R			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS; DISEASE; POLIOMYELITIS; ASSOCIATION; ATROPHY; IMPAIRMENT; SEQUELAE; SCALE; MRI	Background: Acute paralytic poliomyelitis is associated with encephalitis. Early brain inflammation may produce permanent neuronal injury with brain atrophy, which may result in symptoms such as fatigue. Brain volume has not been assessed in postpoliomyelitis syndrome (PPS). Objective: To determine whether brain volume is decreased compared with that in normal controls, and whether brain volume is associated with fatigue in patients with PPS. Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: Tertiary university-affiliated hospital postpolio and multiple sclerosis (MS) clinics. Participants: Forty-nine ambulatory patients with PPS, 28 normal controls, and 53 ambulatory patients with MS. Methods: We studied the brains of all study subjects with magnetic resonance imaging by using a 1.5 T Siemens Sonata machine. The subjects completed the Fatigue Severity Scale. Multivariable linear regression models were computed to evaluate the contribution of PPS and MS compared with controls to explain brain volume. Main Outcome Measurements: Normalized brain volume (NBV) was assessed with the automated program Structured Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy method from the acquired magnetic resonance images. This method may miss brainstem atrophy. Results: Technically adequate NBV measurements were available for 42 patients with PPS, 27 controls, and 49 patients with MS. The mean (standard deviation) age was 60.9 +/- 7.6 years for patients with PPS, 47.0 +/- 14.6 years for controls, and 46.2 +/- 9.4 years for patients with MS. In a multivariable model adjusted for age and gender, NBV was not significantly different in patients with PPS compared with that in controls (P = .28). As expected, when using a similar model for patients with MS, NBV was significantly decreased compared with that in controls (P = .006). There was no significant association between NBV and fatigue in subjects with PPS (Spearman p = 0.23; P = .19). Conclusions: No significant whole-brain atrophy was found, and no association of brain volume with fatigue in PPS. Brain atrophy was confirmed in MS. It is possible that brainstem atrophy was not recognized by this study.

Specifically, advances in neuroscience have identified multiple memory systems that are each mediated by different brain areas. Two memory systems used to navigate an environment are 'place' and 'response' memory. They are defined as either using an allocentric strategy: using a spatial or cognitive map of the surroundings, or an egocentric strategy: using habitual-turns/movements, respectively. Studies in neuroendocrinology have shown that estrogen levels can bias a female to use one memory system over another to solve a task, such that high estrogen levels are associated with using place memory and low levels with using response memory. Furthermore, recent advances in identifying and localizing estrogen receptors in the rodent brain are uncovering which brain regions are affected by estrogen and providing insight into how hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause might affect which memory system is facilitated or impaired in women at different life stages. These studies can help point the way to improving cognitive health in women.

On the basis of these advances, AD is now conceptualized as a continuum comprising asymptomatic, minimally symptomatic, and dementia phases, with detection of brain A beta - in particular, via PET amyloid imaging - central to the diagnostic process. In this respect, [F-18]florbetapir (Amyvid (TM)) and [F-18]flutemetamol (Vizamyl (TM)) have recently received approval for clinical use from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), with additional radiofluorinated tracers for detection of A beta in phase III trials. Recent initiatives such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) suggest that A beta production, oligomerization and aggregation begins many years, possibly decades, before detectable cognitive impairment, with A beta shown to associate with cognitive decline and conversion to dementia. While personalized medicine has now emerged as a prospect for the field, the recent decision by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) - who declined to cover the cost of amyloid PET imaging citing insufficient evidence to support its clinical utility - highlights that such a move may be premature.

Both groups were tested for biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease and their brains were scanned using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The subjects with poor DRT performance had evidence of atrophy in the hippocampus and cortical areas, significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid beta amino acid 1-42 (p<0.001) and higher cerebrospinal fluid total tau levels (p<0.05) compared to the group performing well on the DRT tests. Conclusion: Old, memory-impaired Cynomolgus monkeys may be useful as a spontaneous non-human primate model for investigations of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Comparison between transperineal ultrasound and digital detection of levator ani trauma. Can we improve the odds?	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Article						trauma; levator ani muscle; 3D ultrasound; digital assessment	PELVIC FLOOR ULTRASOUND; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; ABNORMALITIES; REPRODUCIBILITY; QUANTIFICATION; PALPATION; EXERCISE; VALIDITY; PROLAPSE	Aims To investigate the predictive ability of four digital assessment parameters to detect levator ani (LA) muscle defects (avulsion injury) and compare these to transperineal tomographic ultrasound images. Methods This was an observational study imbedded in a larger quasi-experimental cohort study for women with urinary incontinence. Seventy-two women, >= 60 years who had attended or were going to attend physiotherapy for treatment of urinary incontinence, were included in the study. Inclusion criteria from the parent study were symptoms of stress, urge or both types of urinary incontinence. The predictive ability of the following digital parameters: direct palpation of a discontinuity of the LA muscle from insertion on the pubic ramus; palpation of the distance between the muscle insertion sites; palpation of LA strength; palpation of LA tone, were analyzed against findings from tomographic transperineal ultrasound images. Correlation between methods was measured using Cohen's kappa for each of the individual parameters. Results Seventeen women (24%) presented with a complete or partial avulsion of the puborectalis muscle as diagnosed with tomographic ultrasound imaging. Nine women (13%) had complete avulsions, one of which was bilateral. The predictive ability of the digital assessment parameters varied from poor (k = 0.187, 95% CI [0.02-0.36]) to moderate (k = 0.569, 95% CI [0.31-0.83]). The new parameter of 'width between insertion sites' performed best. Conclusions Adding the parameter of "width between insertion sites" appears to enhance our ability to detect avulsion of the levator ani (LA) muscle by digital examination however it does not distinguish between unilateral or bilateral avulsion.

However, most investigations of cognition and remission are cross-sectional or have studied samples of chronically ill patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare cognitive performance between remitted and non-remitted first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients longitudinally. Seventy patients were categorized as remitted (n = 17) or non-remitted (n = 53) using the full RSWG criteria after being treated for approximately 15 months, during which cognition was evaluated twice. Since our previous investigations in FEP have isolated verbal memory as a potential cognitive marker of symptomatic remission, analyses were limited to verbal, visual and working memory. We have found that non-remitted patients had a significantly worse verbal memory performance than remitted patients after 3 months (F-(1,F-68) = 6.47, p = 0.006) and 15 months of treatment (F-(1,F-68) = 19.49, p < 0.001). Visual memory was also significantly lower in non-remitted patients compared to those in remission but only at initial assessment (F-(1,F-68) = 8.21, p = 0.003) while working memory performance was similar at both time points. Our findings suggest that verbal memory may be a specific and stable marker of clinical remission in FEP patients. This cognitive domain can easily be evaluated at treatment intake in the hope of identifying early on patients who are less likely to remit. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

In the current study we examined thickness of insular cortices and bilateral skin conductance responses (SCR) in healthy subjects in addition to a small number of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. SCR measures arousal and is used to assess non-conscious responses to emotional stimuli. We used two emotion tasks, one explicitly about emotion and the other implicit. The explicit task required judgments about emotions being expressed in photographs of faces, while the implicit one required judgments about the age of the people in the photographs. Patients and healthy differed in labeling neutral faces, but not other emotions. They also differed in their SCR to emotions, though the profile depended on which hand the recordings were from. Finally, we found relationships between the thickness of the insula and SCR to each task: in the healthy group the thickness of the left insula was related to SCR to the emotion-labeling task; in the patient group it was between the thickness of the right insula and SCR in the age-labeling task. These patterns were evident only for the right hand recordings, thus underscoring the importance of bilateral recordings.

These indexes are based on composite scores of neuropsychological tests validated in English-speaking populations, and their use in aging research is growing in popularity. This study aimed at validating the MTL/memory and FL/executive functions indexes in French-speaking adults. Ninety-eight healthy participants (32 young and 66 older adults) were tested on eight neuropsychological tests, three associated with MTL/memory functions and five associated with FL/executive functions. Factor analysis indicated that residual scores independent of age and associated with MTL/memory functions grouped under one factor, and residual scores associated with FL/executive functions grouped under another factor. Bootstrapping analysis with 1,000 resamples confirmed stability for seven neuropsychological tests. This study provides the first validation of the MTL/memory and FL/executive functions composite scores in French-speaking adults, which may be used to assess cognitive changes in aging research.

It can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, from subtle to severe or even life threatening, and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay in patients presenting with a range of conditions. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in widely different conditions and the fact that hyponatraemia is managed by clinicians with a broad variety of backgrounds have fostered diverse institution-and speciality-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment. To obtain a common and holistic view, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA- EDTA), represented by European Renal Best Practice (ERBP), have developed the Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia. In addition to a rigorous approach to methodology and evaluation, we were keen to ensure that the document focused on patient-important outcomes and included utility for clinicians involved in everyday practice.

IMPROVING FORECASTING ACCURACY OF THE S&P500 INTRA-DAY PRICE DIRECTION USING BOTH WAVELET LOW AND HIGH FREQUENCY COEFFICIENTS	FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS			English	Article						Wavelet transform; low frequency components; high frequency components; time series; classification	LEAST-SQUARE REGRESSIONS; FINANCIAL TIME-SERIES; INDEX	Numerous research works have successfully applied the wavelet analysis for the decomposition and forecasting of financial data. Particularly, using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) stock price time series were analyzed following a fixed sub-band coding scheme, which provides a low time resolution for low frequencies and a high time resolution for high frequencies. Following the standard approach found in the literature, only low frequency components were considered as main features to predict stock prices. However, this approach lacks of details about the generative process of the original data. In this paper, we rely on DWT high frequency sub-band to extract short interval hidden information for better classification of future Standard and Poors (S&P500) one minute ahead direction using artificial neural network trained with backpropagation algorithm. The simulation results show that our approach that uses both low (approximation) and high (detail) frequency coefficients provides better classification rates than the standard one. In addition, simulation results show that low frequency components are appropriate to detect future downshifts in S&P500, whilst our approach is suitable to predict future upwards. Thus, the standard approach provides valuable information for risk averse investors trading S&P500, and our approach that combines low and high frequency coefficients is strongly useful for aggressive investors seeking short-term profits when trading S&P500.

Propofol compared with isoflurane inhibits mitochondrial metabolism in immature swine cerebral cortex	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						anesthesia; energy metabolism; glucose; mitochondria; MR spectroscopy	EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE-OXYGENATION; RAT-BRAIN; EARLY EXPOSURE; FATTY-ACID; IN-VIVO; ANESTHESIA; OXIDATION; NMR; PHOSPHORYLATION; SPECTROSCOPY	Anesthetics used in infants and children are implicated in the development of neurocognitive disorders. Although propofol induces neuroapoptosis in developing brain, the underlying mechanisms require elucidation and may have an energetic basis. We studied substrate utilization in immature swine anesthetized with either propofol or isoflurane for 4 hours. Piglets were infused with 13Carbon-labeled glucose and leucine in the common carotid artery to assess citric acid cycle (CAC) metabolism in the parietal cortex. The anesthetics produced similar systemic hemodynamics and cerebral oxygen saturation by near-infrared spectroscopy. Compared with isoflurane, propofol depleted ATP and glycogen stores. Propofol decreased pools of the CAC intermediates, citrate, and alpha-ketoglutarate, while markedly increasing succinate along with decreasing mitochondrial complex II activity. Propofol also inhibited acetyl-CoA entry into the CAC through pyruvate dehydrogenase, while promoting glycolytic flux with marked lactate accumulation. Although oxygen supply appeared similar between the anesthetic groups, propofol yielded a metabolic phenotype that resembled a hypoxic state. Propofol impairs substrate flux through the CAC in the immature cerebral cortex. These impairments occurred without systemic metabolic perturbations that typically accompany propofol infusion syndrome. These metabolic abnormalities may have a role in the neurotoxity observed with propofol in the vulnerable immature brain.

NT provides strong analgesia when administered directly into the brain; however, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle for effective delivery of potential analgesics to the brain. To overcome this challenge, we synthesized chemical conjugates that are transported across the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis using the brain-penetrant peptide Angiopep-2 (An2), which targets LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1). Using in situ brain perfusion in mice, we found that the compound ANG2002, a conjugate of An2 and NT, was transported at least 10 times more efficiently across the BBB than native NT. In vitro, ANG2002 bound NTS1 and NTS2 receptors and maintained NT-associated biological activity. In rats, i.v. ANG2002 induced a dose-dependent analgesia in the formalin model of persistent pain. At a dose of 0.05 mg/kg, ANG2002 effectively reversed pain behaviors induced by the development of neuropathic and bone cancer pain in animal models. The analgesic properties of ANG2002 demonstrated in this study suggest that this compound is effective for clinical management of persistent and chronic pain and establish the benefits of this technology for the development of neurotherapeutics.

Schizophrenia and violence	NERVENARZT			German	Article						Forensic; Schizophrenia; Violence; Conduct disorder; Literature review	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; CONDUCT DISORDER; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; MENTAL-DISORDERS; BIRTH COHORT; CRIME; VICTIMIZATION; PEOPLE	There is now robust evidence that schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of violence. Across Europe, the numbers of forensic hospital beds have dramatically increased largely due to admissions of men with schizophrenia. This article critically reviews the extant literature on schizophrenia and violence. A systematic review of the literature was carried out. People with schizophrenia are at increased risk, as compared to the general population, to be convicted for violent crimes because they are more likely to engage in aggressive behaviour towards others. While psychotic symptoms explain aggressive behaviour during acute episodes, they do not explain such behaviour at other stages of the illness or prior to onset of illness. Three distinct phenotypes of offenders with schizophrenia have been identified: individuals with a childhood onset of conduct disorder who display antisocial and aggressive behaviour both before and after schizophrenia onset, individuals with no history of conduct problems who begin engaging in aggressive behaviour at the onset of illness, and individuals who engage in a severe physical assault after many years of illness. Little is known about the aetiology of the three types of offenders and about the neural mechanisms that initiate and maintain these forms of behaviour. Mental health services need to assess the risk of violence among patients with schizophrenia and provide treatments that directly target antisocial and aggressive behaviour.

Thirty-seven individuals with medically intractable epilepsy with onset at 16 years or younger who had resective epilepsy surgery at least two years in the past 9 mean follow-up duration of 8.5 years) were assessed; of these, 13 had seizures within the year prior to the study, and the remainder had none. A comparison group of 16 individuals with childhood-onset intractable epilepsy who had not had surgery, all of whom had experienced at least one seizure in the past 12 months, was also included. The cognitive tests included measures of vocabulary, visuoconstructive ability, memory, and concept formation. Group differences were found only for the vocabulary and verbal memory tests, with the surgical group with seizures having the lowest performance. A subset of the surgical patients had preoperative data available on comparable tests, allowing for an examination of performance over time. Vocabulary scores were higher at follow-up, a finding which was present irrespective of seizure status. The results suggest that after epilepsy surgery in childhood or adolescence, few improvements in cognitive skills related to surgery or seizure outcome are to be expected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A drawback of MI is that it only takes into account the intensity values of corresponding pixels and not of neighborhoods. Therefore, it treats images as "bag of words" and the contextual information is lost. In this work, we present Contextual Conditioned Mutual Information (CoCoMI), which conditions MI estimation on similar structures. Our rationale is that it is more likely for similar structures to undergo similar intensity transformations. The contextual analysis is performed on one of the images offline. Therefore, CoCoMI does not significantly change the registration time. We use CoCoMI as the similarity measure in a regularized cost function with a B-spline deformation field and efficiently optimize the cost function using a stochastic gradient descent method. We show that compared to the state of the art local MI based similarity metrics, CoCoMI does not distort images to enforce erroneous identical intensity transformations for different image structures. We further present the results on nonrigid registration of ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) patient data from image-guided neurosurgery trials performed in our institute and publicly available in the BITE dataset. We show that CoCoMI performs significantly better than the state of the art similarity metrics in US to MR registration. It reduces the average mTRE over 13 patients from 4.12 mm to 2.35 mm, and the maximum mTRE from 9.38 mm to 3.22 mm.	[Rivaz, Hassan; Fonov, Vladimir S.; Collins, D.

Hyponatraemia is present in 15-20 % of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20 % of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

A diagnostic block with local anesthetic was performed under ultrasound guidance (USG), resulting in a decrease of 80% and 100% in dynamic and static visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, respectively, for 20hours. A phenol injection was then performed under USG. The patient reported 70% and 100% reduction in the dynamic and static VAS for pain and had a 50% decrease in the opioid requirement that was maintained for 2months. TAP blocks offer an interesting tool for either diagnosis or therapeutic purpose in chronic pain management. USG provides an optimal approach to soft-tissue lesions where fluoroscopy techniques are not useful.

Several molecules, such as the transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), are implicated in radiation-induced signaling between cells. Brownian Dynamics (BD) algorithms have recently been used to simulate the interaction of ligands with receptors and to elucidate signal transduction and autocrine loops in ligand receptors systems. In this paper, we discuss the simulation of particle diffusion and binding kinetics in a space bounded by two parallel plane membranes, using an exact algorithm to sample the propagator (Green's function) of a particle located between 2 membranes. We also show that the simulation results are independent of the number of time steps used, in accordance with time discretization equations. These simulations could be used to simulate the motion and binding of ligand molecules in a cell culture, and possibly in neuronal synapses. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

J	Mendonca, CT; Schaeffer, MR; Riley, P; Jensen, D				Mendonca, Cassandra T.; Schaeffer, Michele R.; Riley, Patrick; Jensen, Dennis			Physiological mechanisms of dyspnea during exercise with external thoracic restriction: Role of increased neural respiratory drive	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						dyspnea; exercise; diaphragm EMG; respiratory mechanics; neural respiratory drive; thoracic restriction; chest wall strapping	INTERSTITIAL LUNG-DISEASE; OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; CHEST-WALL VIBRATION; INHALED FUROSEMIDE; AIR HUNGER; STRETCH RECEPTORS; VENTILATORY RESPONSE; EXERTIONAL DYSPNEA; MUSCLE FUNCTION; HEALTHY-ADULTS	We tested the hypothesis that neuromechanical uncoupling of the respiratory system forms the mechanistic basis of dyspnea during exercise in the setting of "abnormal" restrictive constraints on ventilation (V-E). To this end, we examined the effect of chest wall strapping (CWS) sufficient to mimic a "mild" restrictive lung deficit on the interrelationships between V-E, breathing pattern, dynamic operating lung volumes, esophageal electrode-balloon catheter-derived measures of the diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi) and the transdiaphragmatic pressure time product (PTPdi), and sensory intensity and unpleasantness ratings of dyspnea during exercise. Twenty healthy men aged 25.7 +/- 1.1 years (means +/- SE) completed symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise tests under two randomized conditions: unrestricted control and CWS to reduce vital capacity (VC) by 21.6 +/- 0.5%. Compared with control, exercise with CWS was associated with 1) an exaggerated EMGdi and PTPdi response; 2) no change in the relationship between EMGdi and each of tidal volume (expressed as a percentage of VC), inspiratory reserve volume, and PTPdi, thus indicating relative preservation of neuromechanical coupling; 3) increased sensory intensity and unpleasantness ratings of dyspnea; and 4) no change in the relationship between increasing EMGdi and each of the intensity and unpleasantness of dyspnea. In conclusion, the increased intensity and unpleasantness of dyspnea during exercise with CWS could not be readily explained by increased neuromechanical uncoupling but likely reflected the awareness of increased neural respiratory drive (EMGdi) needed to achieve any given V-E during exercise in the setting of "abnormal" restrictive constraints on tidal volume expansion.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	LARYNGOSCOPE			English	Review						Type 2 diabetes; hearing function; systematic review; meta-analysis	NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR BDNF; INNER-EAR; ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; NOISE EXPOSURE; AGE; HYPERGLYCEMIA; IMPAIRMENT	Objectives/HypothesisThe aim of this study was to systematically and quantitatively review the available evidence on the effects of type 2 diabetes mellitus on hearing function. Data Sources and Review MethodsEligible studies were identified through searches of eight different electronic databases and manual searching of references. Articles obtained were independently reviewed by two authors using predefined inclusion criteria to identify eligible studies. Meta-analysis was performed on pooled data using Cochrane's Review Manager. ResultsEighteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Hearing loss (HL) was defined by all studies as pure tone average greater than 25dB in the worse ear. The incidence of HL ranged between 44% and 69.7% for type 2 diabetics, significantly higher than in controls (OR 1.91; 95% confidence interval 1.47-2.49). The mean PTA (pure tone audiometry) thresholds were greater in diabetics than in controls for all frequencies [test or overall effect Z=3.68, P=0.0002]. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave V latencies were also statistically significantly longer in diabetics when compared to control groups [OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.82- 4.37, P<0.00001]. ConclusionsType 2 diabetic patients had significantly higher incidence for at least the mild degree of HL when compared with controls. Mean PTA thresholds were greater in diabetics for all frequencies but were more clinically relevant at 6000 and 8000 Hz.

However, the limited spatial resolution of low-density scalp recordings is a roadblock to the unequivocal monitoring and targeting of neuroanatomical regions and physiological signaling. This latter aspect is pivotal to the actual efficiency of neurofeedback procedures, which are expected to engage the modulation of well-identified components of neural activity within and between predetermined brain regions. Our group has previously contributed to demonstrate the principles of real-time magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging. Here we show how the technique was further developed to provide healthy subjects with region-specific neurofeedback to modulate successfully predetermined components of their brain activity in targeted brain regions. Overall, our results positively indicate that neurofeedback based on time-resolved MEG imaging has the potential to become an innovative therapeutic approach in neurology and neuropsychiatry.

However, it now evident that the capacity for binocular vision is present in many observers with amblyopia. This has led to new techniques for quantifying suppression that have provided insights into the relationship between suppression and the monocular and binocular visual deficits experienced by amblyopes. Furthermore, new treatments are emerging that directly target suppressive interactions within the visual cortex and, on the basis of initial data, appear to improve both binocular and monocular visual function, even in adults with amblyopia. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of recent studies that have investigated the structure, measurement and treatment of binocular vision in observers with strabismic, anisometropic and mixed amblyopia.

Taken together, these findings may reflect a generalized reduction in inhibitory processes. The present study assessed whether the decline in the efficacy of pain inhibition processes is associated with decreased cognitive inhibition in older persons. Healthy young (18-46 years old; n = 21) and older (56-75 years old; n = 23) adult volunteers participated in one experimental session to assess the effect of HNCS (cold pain applied on the left forearm) on shock pain and RIII reflex induced by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the right sural nerve. In the same session, participants also performed a modified Stroop task, including a target condition requiring the frequent switching between inhibition and no inhibition of the meaning of color words. The analgesic effect induced by HCNS was significantly smaller in older participants for both shock-pain ratings (P < 0.001) and RIII-reflex amplitude (P < 0.05). The Stroop effect was significantly larger in elderly participants in the inhibition trials of the switching condition. Increased cognitive interference (ie, larger Stroop effect) correlated with smaller inhibition of the RIII reflex by HNCS across groups (r = -.34, P = 0.025). This association was independent from the age-related slowing observed in control reading and naming tasks. These results suggest a generalized age-related reduction in inhibitory processes affecting both executive functions and cerebrospinal processes involved in the regulation of pain-related responses induced by competing nociceptive threats.

The aim of this study was to characterize the structural and metabolic markers of acute inflammatory injury by high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in vivo. METHODS:Twenty-four hours after a 1-mg/kg injection of LPS in postnatal day 3 rat pups, diffusion tensor imaging and proton nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) were analyzed in conjunction to determine markers of cell death and inflammation using immunohistochemistry and gene expression. RESULTS: MRI and MRS in the CC revealed an increase in lactate and free lipids and a decrease of the apparent diffusion coefficient. Detailed evaluation of the CC showed a marked apoptotic response assessed by fractin expression. Interestingly, the degree of reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient correlated strongly with the natural logarithm of fractin expression, in the same region of interest. LPS injection further resulted in increased activated microglia clustered in the cingulum, widespread astrogliosis, and increased expression of genes for interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor. CONCLUSION: This model was able to reproduce the typical MRI hallmarks of acute diffuse white matter injury seen in preterm infants and allowed the evaluation of in vivo biomarkers of acute neuropathology after inflammatory challenge.

Self-esteem change and diurnal cortisol secretion in older adulthood	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Self-esteem; Perceived stress; Depressive symptoms; Diurnal cortisol; secretion; Older adulthood	LIFE-SPAN; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; RESPONSES; HYPOCORTISOLISM; TRAJECTORIES; AGE; NEUROENDOCRINE; DEPRESSION; REJECTION; FEMALES	Objective: Research suggests that self-esteem can decline in older adulthood. This process could remove a buffer that normally protects individuals against distress-related changes in cortisol secretion. We examined this possibility by testing whether change in self-esteem would predict alterations in cortisol secretion, particularly among older adults who reported high levels of depressive symptoms or perceived stress. Methods: 147 older adults (aged 60+) completed three days of diurnal cortisol measurements at three different time points, namely every two years over a total period of four years. Measures of self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress were assessed at Ti and T2. Potential demographic and health-related confounds were measured at baseline (partnership status, SES, mortality risk index, and medication). Results: Linear regression models indicated that a decline in self-esteem from T1 to T2 predicted elevated cortisol output (AUC(G)) from T2 to T3, F (1, 137) = 8.09, beta =.25, R-2 =.05, p =.005. Interaction analyses revealed that this association was particularly strong among participants who experienced higher Ti or T2 levels of depressive symptoms or perceived stress, +1 SD: beta s=.34 to.51, ps <.001, but not significant among their counterparts who reported relatively lower levels of depressive symptoms or perceived stress, 1 SD: beta s =.03 to 11, ps >.43. Conclusions: Declines in self-esteem represent a mechanism that contributes to higher levels of diurnal cortisol secretion if older adults experience psychological distress. Increases in selfesteem, by contrast, can ameliorate older adults' cortisol regulation in stressful circumstances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Perception of Recovery After Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Is Influenced by the "Good Old Days" Bias: Tangible Implications for Clinical Practice and Outcomes Research	ARCHIVES OF CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Concussion; Children; Bias; Symptom; Post-concussion syndrome; Recovery	POSTCONCUSSION-SYNDROME; CONCUSSION; SYMPTOMS; EXPECTATION; ETIOLOGY	Recovery from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is primarily based on the resolution of post-concussive symptoms back to a premorbid level. However, the "good old days" bias means fewer premorbid symptoms are retrospectively recalled, thus skewing the determination of recovery relative to pre-injury. The objectives of this study were to investigate the "good old days" bias in pediatric mTBI and demonstrate the implications of this bias on perceived recovery. Children and adolescents 2-18 years old (mean 10.9, SD 4.4, N 412) were recruited after sustaining an mTBI. Ratings of premorbid symptoms were provided: (a) in the Emergency Department (ED; by parents), (b) retrospectively at a 1-month follow-up (by parents and adolescents), and (c) retrospectively at a 3-month follow-up (by parents and adolescents). Parent ratings of premorbid symptoms decreased by 80% from the ED to 1-month post-injury (p < .001) but were stable from 1 to 3 months post-injury (p < .05). Adolescents premorbid ratings declined from 1 to 3 months post-injury. Slow recovery did not have a differential impact on premorbid reporting. Using premorbid ratings obtained in the ED, instead of retrospective symptom reporting at the time of follow-up, suggests that a significant minority of patients believed to be "not recovered" actually have the "same or lower" symptom ratings at 1 (29%) and 3 months (41%) post-injury compared with before the injury. The "good old days" bias is present in pediatric mTBI by 1-month post-injury, influences retrospective symptom reporting, and has measureable implications for determining recovery in research and clinical practice.

This neuronal system is highly dependent on NGF for its synaptic integrity and the phenotypic maintenance of its cell bodies. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons progressively degenerate in Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome, and their atrophy contributes to the manifestation of dementia. Paradoxically, in Alzheimer's disease brains, the synthesis of NGF is not affected and there is abundance of the NGF precursor, proNGF. We have shown that this phenomenon is the result of a deficit in NGF's extracellular metabolism that compromises proNGF maturation and exacerbates its subsequent degradation. We hypothesized that a similar imbalance should be present in Down's syndrome. Using a combination of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and zymography, we investigated signs of NGF metabolic dysfunction in post-mortem brains from the temporal (n = 14), frontal (n = 34) and parietal (n = 20) cortex obtained from subjects with Down's syndrome and age-matched controls (age range 31-68 years). We further examined primary cultures of human foetal Down's syndrome cortex (1721 gestational age weeks) and brains from Ts65Dn mice (12-22 months), a widely used animal model of Down's syndrome. We report a significant increase in proNGF levels in human and mouse Down's syndrome brains, with a concomitant reduction in the levels of plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator messenger RNA as well as an increment in neuroserpin expression; enzymes that partake in proNGF maturation. Human Down's syndrome brains also exhibited elevated zymogenic activity of MMP9, the major NGF-degrading protease. Our results indicate a failure in NGF precursor maturation in Down's syndrome brains and a likely enhanced proteolytic degradation of NGF, changes which can compromise the trophic support of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. The alterations in proNGF and MMP9 were also present in cultures of Down's syndrome foetal cortex; suggesting that this trophic compromise may be amenable to rescue, before frank dementia onset. Our study thus provides a novel paradigm for cholinergic neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome.	[Iulita, M. Florencia; Do Carmo, Sonia; Ower, Alison K.; Cuello, A.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between the volume of striatum and general cognitive ability in a sample of 303 healthy children that were sampled to be representative of the population of the United States. Correlations between the WASI-IQ and the left striatum, composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen, were significant. When these data were analyzed separately for male and female children, positive correlations were significant for the left striatum in male children only. This brain structure-behavior relation further promotes the increasingly accepted view that the striatum is intimately involved in higher order cognitive functions. Our results also suggest that the importance of these brain regions in cognitive ability might differ for male and female children.

There is, however, limited information on the time course of these changes. We recently obtained intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from the ventroposterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus and from the motor cortex during induction of anesthesia in three patients to study the time course of the alterations of cortical and thalamic function. The patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II males aged 33-57 yr with intractable central pain caused by brachial plexus injury (patient 1 and 2) or insular infarct (patient 3). Anesthesia was induced with propofol (2.5-3.1 mg center dot kg(-1) over 30-45 sec) followed, after loss of consciousness, by rocuronium for tracheal intubation. The data retained for analysis are from one minute before the start of propofol to 110 sec later during ventilation of the patients' lungs before tracheal intubation. Spectral analysis was used to measure absolute EEG power. Propofol caused significant increases of cortical and thalamic power in the delta to beta frequency bands (1-30 Hz). These increases of cortical and thalamic power occurred either concomitantly or within seconds of each other. Propofol also caused a decrease in cortical and thalamic high-gamma (62-200 Hz) power that also followed a similar time course. We conclude that induction of anesthesia with propofol in these patients was associated with concurrent alterations of cortical and sensory thalamic activity.

The homologs of these 3 cingulate motor areas in the human brain are poorly understood. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined the anatomo-functional organization of the cingulate motor areas in the human brain. A subject by subject analysis revealed the existence of 3 motor areas along the cgs and these areas appear to be somatotopically organized. Importantly, these 3 motor areas relate to the specific morphological features of the cingulate/paracingulate cortex. These results demonstrate the location and organization of the 3 cingulate motor areas in the human brain and suggest a well-preserved organization of these motor areas from the monkey to the human brain.

We have previously shown a significant association between isolated injury to the premature cerebellum and subsequent impairment of regional volumetric growth in the contralateral cerebrum. In the current study, we examine the relationship between these remote regional impairments of cerebral volumetric growth and domain-specific functional deficits in these children. In 40 ex-preterm infants with isolated cerebellar injury, we performed neurodevelopmental evaluations and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies at a mean age of 34 months. We measured cortical gray matter volumes in 8 parcellated regions of each cerebral hemisphere, as well as right and left cerebellar volumes. We show highly significant associations between early signs of autism and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume (P 0.001); gross motor scores and sensorimotor cortical volumes (P 0.001); and cognitive and expressive language scores and premotor and mid-temporal cortical volumes (P 0.001). By multivariate analyses, each unit increase in the corresponding regional cerebral volume was associated with lower odds of abnormal outcome score, adjusted for age at MRI and contralateral cerebellar volume. This is the first report linking secondary impairment of remote cerebral cortical growth and functional disabilities in survivors of prematurity-related cerebellar brain injury.

The aim of this research was to use a procedure previously developed to standardize PCB biological concentration data between published studies to perform a systematic analysis of associations between PCB exposure and thyroid hormones (THs) (total and free T3 and T4) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in pregnant women and newborns. Biological concentrations from nineteen studies were expressed in total PCB equivalent per kg of lipids in maternal plasma (mu g PCBMPEQ kg(-1) lipids). Systematic analysis of the "standardized biological concentration-thyroid parameters" relationship was conducted through the application of methodological criteria in both pregnant women and newborns. Standardization of PCB levels and application of methodological criteria led to assign higher confidence to ten of the reviewed studies. Among the retained studies in pregnant women, only one reported a significant association between PCBs and total T3 levels, but no association were observed when circulating TSH and free T4 levels were used to assess thyroid function. Regarding the association between prenatal PCB exposure and thyroid status in newborns, a lack of significant association was consistently obtained in the retained studies assigned an overall high confidence. The weight of evidence of a significant impact of PCB exposure on TSH and TH levels at the described biological levels in pregnant women and newborns (mean < 1000 mu g PCBMPEQ. kg(-1) lipids) appears low according to this systematical analysis.

The impact of drinking water, indoor dust and paint on blood lead levels of children aged 1-5 years in Montreal (Quebec, Canada)	JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						blood lead levels; children; paint; dust; drinking water	HOUSE-DUST; US CHILDREN; EXPOSURE; WASHINGTON; CHILDHOOD; RISK; DC	Lead is neurotoxic at very low dose and there is a need to better characterize the impact of domestic sources of lead on the biological exposure of young children. A cross-sectional survey evaluated the contribution of drinking water, house dust and paint to blood lead levels (BLLs) of young children living in old boroughs of Montreal (Canada). Three hundred and six children aged 1 to 5 years and currently drinking tap water participated in the study. For each participant, residential lead was measured in kitchen tap water, floor dust, windowsill dust and house paint and a venous blood sample was analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between elevated BLL in the children (>= 75th percentile) and indoor lead contamination by means of odds ratios (OR) using 95% confidence intervals (Cl). There was an association between BLL 75th percentile (1.78 mu g/dL) and water lead when the mean water concentration was > 3.3 mu g/L: adjusted OR = 4.7 (95% Cl: 2.1-10.2). Windowsill dust loading > 14.1 mu g/ft(2) was also associated with BLL >= 1.78 mu g/dL: adjusted OR=3.2 (95% Cl: 1.3-7.8). Despite relatively low BLLs, tap water and house dust lead contribute to an increase of BLLs in exposed young children.

What Work Means to People with Work Disability: A Scoping Review	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL REHABILITATION			English	Review						Meaning of work; Work disability; Work rehabilitation; Scoping review	PERSISTENT MENTAL-ILLNESS; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; TERM SICK LEAVE; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; CANCER SURVIVORS; EXPERIENCES; RETURN; EMPLOYMENT; PERSPECTIVES; INDIVIDUALS	Purpose: As paid work is the occupation that people spend the most amount of their time doing, it is an important provider of personal meaning in their lives. This meaning has been shown to vary from person to person and to be important to health and well being. When a person is unable to work due to a disabling condition, it is unclear whether this meaning remains or is replaced by other meanings. The purpose of this scoping review was to explore what was known in the existing literature on what work means to those with work disability. Methods: The review involved identifying and selecting relevant studies, charting the data and collating and summarizing the results. Results: Fifty-two studies explored the meaning of work for those with cancer, mental illness, musculoskeletal disorders, brain injuries, paraplegia, and AIDS. The studies revealed that, for most, work continued to be meaningful and important. Common themes across all types of disability included work being a source of identity, feelings of normality, financial support, and socialization. These meanings were found to be both motivating for return to work and health promoting. Conversely, a small number of studies found that the meanings and values ascribed to work changed following disability. New meanings, found either at home or in modified work, replaced the old and contributed to new identities. Conclusions: The exploration of the meaning of work has been shown to provide important understanding of the experience of work and disability. This understanding can guide rehabilitation professionals in their interventions with the work disabled.	[Saunders, S.

This study used data of n=3,081 adolescents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to examine whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a polymorphism that affects psychological functioning, moderates the association between affiliation with aggressive peers at age 10 and own aggression at age 15. A significant gene-environment interaction was found, where those who affiliated with aggressive peers in childhood showed increased risk of being aggressive in adolescence if they carried the BDNF met-met variant compared with val-val carriers. Our findings underline the importance of both biological and social factors for adolescent development.

Recently, impaired neurogenesis has been reported in the hippocampus during the dietary form of TD, and in pyrithiamine-induced TD (PTD), a well-characterized model of WE. To further characterize the consequences of PTD on neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) activity, we have examined the effect of this treatment in the rat on both the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the rostral lateral ventricle and subgranular layer (SGL) of the hippocampus, and in the thalamus and inferior colliculus, two vulnerable brain regions in this disorder. In both the SVZ and SGL, PTD led to a decrease in the numbers of bromodeoxyuridine-stained cells, indicating that proliferation of NSPCs destined for neurogenesis in these areas was reduced. Doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining in the SGL was decreased, indicating a reduction in neuroblast formation, consistent with impaired NSPC activity. DCX labeling was not apparent in focal areas of vulnerability. In the thalamus, proliferation of cells was absent while in the inferior colliculus, numerous actively dividing cells were apparent, indicative of a differential response between these two brain regions. Exposure of cultured neurospheres to PTD resulted in decreased proliferation of NSPCs, consistent with our in vivo findings. Together, these results indicate that PTD considerably affects cell proliferation and neurogenesis activity in both neurogenic areas and parts of the brain known to display structural and functional vulnerability, confirming and extending recent findings on the effects of TD on neurogenesis. Future use of NSPCs in vitro may allow a closer and more detailed examination of the mechanism(s) underlying inhibition of these cells during TD.

Methods: The PIPP was revised to enhance validity and feasibility. To validate the PIPP-R, data from 2 randomized cross-over studies were utilized to: (1) calculate and compare PIPP and PIPP-R scores in extremely low gestational age infants undergoing a painful and nonpainful event (N=52; dataset #1) and (2) calculate and compare PIPP and PIPP-R scores in assessing the effectiveness of (a) sucrose, (b) non-nutritive sucking (NNS)+sucrose, and (c) facilitated tucking+NNS+sucrose during heel lance (N=85; dataset #2). Pearson correlations between PIPP and PIPP-R scores were calculated, and Student t tests and 1-way analysis of variance were used to determine construct validity during painful and nonpainful events. To establish feasibility, a survey of 31 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit nurses was conducted. Results: PIPP-R scores were significantly lower during nonpainful (mean, 8.3; SD=2.9) compared with painful (mean, 9.9; SD=3.1; t(95)=4.51, P=0.036) events in extremely low gestational age infants in dataset #1. In dataset #2, PIPP-R scores were significantly lower in infants 25 to 41 weeks gestation in the group receiving NNS+sucrose compared with the other 2 groups (F-2,F-79=2.9, P < 0.05). Overall, nurses rated the PIPP-R as feasible. Discussion: Initial construct validation and feasibility of the PIPP-R was demonstrated. Further testing with infants of varying gestational ages, diagnoses, and pain conditions is required; as is exploration of PIPP-R in relation to other types of physiological and cognitive responses.

It is known that this trait modulates fear learning and the activation of brain regions involved in it such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex and their connectivity. Thirty-nine (21 female) 14-year-old healthy adolescents participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of aversive pavlovian differential delay conditioning. An unpleasant sound served as unconditioned stimulus (US) and pictures of neutral male faces as conditioned stimuli (CS+ followed by the US in 50% of the cases; CS- never followed by the US). During acquisition (CS+/- differentiation), higher levels of neuroticism were associated with a stronger interaction between the right amygdala and the right hippocampus as well as the right amygdala and prefrontal cortical regions, specifically ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. The association of stronger conditionability of fear and connectivity of brain regions related to consolidation of fear associations and neuroticism points to underlying mechanisms of the enhanced propensity for anxiety disorders in highly neurotic participants. This is especially important in adolescence, a vulnerable time for the onset of mental disorders such as anxiety disorders.

Neuronal activity during wakefulness leads to a subsequent increase in sleep intensity as measured using electroencephalographic slow-wave activity (SWA; index of neuronal synchrony in the low-frequency range). Wakefulness, and particularly prolonged wakefulness, also drives important changes in brain gene expression and changes in protein regulation. The role of these two cellular mechanisms in sleep-wake regulation has typically been studied independently, and their exact contribution to SWA remains poorly defined. In this review, we highlight that many transcriptional pathways driven by sleep deprivation are associated to protein regulation. We first describe the relationship between cytokines, clock genes, and markers of sleep need with an emphasis on transcriptional processes. Observations regarding the role of protein metabolism in sleep-wake regulation are then depicted while presenting interconnections between transcriptional and translational responses driven by sleep loss. Lastly, a manner by which this integrated response can feed back on neuronal network activity to determine sleep intensity is proposed. Overall, the literature supports that a complex cross-talk between transcriptional and translational regulation during prolonged wakefulness drives the changes in sleep intensity as a function of the sleep/wake history.

Microcystis aeruginosa form blooms in the pelagic area of eutrophic lakes and produce a series of potent hepatotoxins-microcystins (MCYST). The aim of this study in vitro study was to examine the difference between the crude extracts of either M. aeruginosa or L. wollei toward the immune system of Elliptio complanata mussels. Freshly isolated hemolymph was plated and exposed to the crude extract of each species at LYNGTX or MCYST equivalent concentrations of 5, 10 and 25 mu g/L for 18 h. Immunocompetence was characterized by following changes in hemocyte numbers, metabolic activity (viability), and phagocytosis. Hemocyte counts were not affected, indicating no turnover of hemocytes. Hemocyte metabolic activity was higher in cells exposed to crude extracts of L. wollei. Exposure to L. wollei extracts led to decreased pro-inflammatory precursors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) activities. Phagocytosis increased at 25 mu g/L for both types of crude extracts. However, hemocytes exposed to crude extracts of M. aeruginosa produced more ROS and COX compared to hemocytes exposed to crude extracts of L. wollei. In conclusion, the data suggest that the crude extract of M. aeruginosa was more toxic than crude extract of L. wollei to mussel hemocytes.

Cognitive impairment among children at-risk for schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Intelligence; Psychosis; Risk factors; Genetic liability; Developmental psychopathology; Psychotic-like experiences	PSYCHOTIC-LIKE EXPERIENCES; AGED 9-12 YEARS; PUTATIVE ANTECEDENTS; ADULT SCHIZOPHRENIA; FAMILY-HISTORY; PERFORMANCE; DEFICITS; ABNORMALITIES; LIABILITY; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY	Adults with schizophrenia present cognitive impairments, as do individuals at ultra-high risk for the disorder, youth with relatives with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and children with antecedents of schizophrenia. The present study aimed to determine if impairments in childhood differed depending on the definition of risk and/or on the degree of relatedness to an affected individual, and if impairments were explained by IQ. Four groups of children aged 9-12 years were studied: (1) 13 children with >= 1 first-degree or >= 2 second-degree affected relatives (high familial loading: FHx(H)); (2) 14 with >= 1 affected second-degree relative (lower familial loading: FHx(L)); (3) 32 with well-replicated antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz); and (4) 45 typically-developing (TD) children with neither a positive family history nor antecedents. Compared to TD children, both FHx(H) and ASz children exhibited significantly poorer verbal comprehension, scholastic achievement, and verbal working memory, while FHx(H) children additionally displayed significantly lower full-scale IQ, and verbal memory and executive function impairments. After adjusting statistical analyses for IQ, group differences were attenuated. Relative to TD children, FHx(L) children showed no significant differences in performance. The results imply that impairments in verbal comprehension, scholastic achievement, and verbal working memory may index vulnerability for schizophrenia among children with affected relatives with the disorder and among those with multiple antecedents of the disorder who have no affected relatives. More accurate identification of children at-risk for schizophrenia and the specific deficits that they present provides opportunities for interventions such as cognitive remediation that may impact the development of the illness.

ObjectivesTo test this hypothesis, we studied invivo using positron-emission tomography (PET) and -[C-11] methyl-L-tryptophan (-[C-11]MTrp) as a surrogate marker of cerebral 5-HT synthetic rate before and after administration of eletriptan in migraine and control subjects. MethodsSix nonmenopausal female migraine subjects with migraine without aura (MoA) and six nonmenopausal age-matched female control subjects were scanned at baseline and after oral administration of 40mg of eletriptan. Migraine subjects at the time of PET had to have been headache free for a minimum of three days. Images of (-[C-11]MTrp) brain trapping were colocalized with individual MRI images in three dimensions and analyzed. ResultsThere was no difference in baseline cerebral global 5-HT synthesis between migraine and control subjects. After administration of eletriptan, there was a striking global reduction in cerebral 5-HT synthesis (K*) in the migraine group and in 22 regions of interest (ROIs). In control subjects, no significant changes were found in global cerebral 5-HT synthesis (K*) or in any of the ROIs. ConclusionsThese findings suggest in migraine an interictal alteration in the regulation mechanisms of cerebral 5-HT synthesis.

Pentoxifylline reduces chronic post-ischaemia pain by alleviating microvascular dysfunction	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY; FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS; SYNDROME-TYPE-I; REACTIVE HYPEREMIA; BLOOD-FLOW; RAT MODEL; INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION; REPERFUSION INJURY; TACTILE ALLODYNIA; NEUROPATHIC PAIN	BackgroundMicrovascular dysfunction and ischaemia in muscle play a role in the development of cutaneous tactile allodynia in chronic post-ischaemia pain (CPIP). Hence, studies were designed to assess whether pentoxifylline (PTX), a vasodilator and haemorrheologic agent, relieves allodynia in CPIP rats by alleviating microvascular dysfunction. MethodsLaser Doppler flowmetry of plantar blood flow was used to examine the effects of PTX on CPIP-induced alterations in post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (reflecting microvascular dysfunction), and von Frey testing was used to examine its effects on CPIP-induced allodynia. Time-course effects of PTX on allodynia and microvascular dysfunction were assessed early (2-8 days) and late (18-25 days) post-ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and its effects on allodynia were also tested at 30 days post-I/R injury. ResultsPTX (25mg/kg) produced significant anti-allodynic effects throughout the 21-day time course, but was not effective 30 days post-I/R injury. In laser Doppler studies, the reduced reactive hyperaemia in early CPIP rats was significantly improved by PTX (25mg/kg). Conversely, treatment with PTX at the same dose did not affect reactive hyperaemia in late CPIP rats, likely since reactive hyperaemia was not significantly reduced pre-drug in these animals. ConclusionSince poor tissue perfusion underlies early stages of CPIP pain, the ameliorative effect of PTX on microvascular dysfunction might account for its anti-allodynic effect in our experimental model of complex regional pain syndrome type I.

We sought to prolong the effect by injecting allogeneic rat bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells before and after microencapsulation into the substantia nigra pars compacta. Materials and Methods: Female rats underwent unilateral stereotactic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine in the medial forebrain bundle. Injection was performed in the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars compacta using vehicle alone or vehicle with nonmicroencapsulated or microencapsulated rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells. Rats were evaluated by cystometry 7, 14, 28 and 42 days after treatment. Brains were extracted for immunostaining. Results: At 42 days the nonmicroencapsulated group had lower threshold and intermicturition pressure, spontaneous activity and AUC than vehicle treated animals. Rats that received microencapsulated cells had lower threshold pressure at 28 days and lower spontaneous activity at 42 days than vehicle treated rats. Microencapsulated and nonmicroencapsulated rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells were noted in the substantia nigra pars compacta up to 42 days after transplantation. At 42 days tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons were more numerous in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the nonmicroencapsulated group, followed by the microencapsulated and vehicle treated groups. Conclusions: Urodynamic effects of the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion persisted up to 42 days after vehicle injection. Transplantation of nonmicroencapsulated rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells improved urodynamic pressure by 42 days after treatment more markedly than microencapsulated cells. This was associated with more tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the treated substantia nigra pars compacta of the nonmicroencapsulated group, suggesting that functional improvement requires a juxtacrine effect.

Lipopolysaccharide precipitates hepatic encephalopathy and increases blood-brain barrier permeability in mice with acute liver failure	LIVER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						acute liver failure; azoxymethane; blood-brain barrier; endotoxemia; immunoglobulin G extravasation; lipopolysaccharide; matrix metalloproteinase-9; pro-inflammatory cytokines; systemic inflammatory response	NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; CEREBRAL EDEMA; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; N-ACETYLCYSTEINE; MATRIX-METALLOPROTEINASE-9; MODEL; PATHOGENESIS; CYTOKINES; ENDOTOXIN	Background & AimsAcute liver failure (ALF) is frequently complicated by infection leading to precipitation of central nervous system complications such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and increased mortality. There is evidence to suggest that when infection occurs in ALF patients, the resulting pro-inflammatory mechanisms may be amplified that could, in turn, have a major impact on blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of endotoxemia on the progression of encephalopathy in relation to BBB permeability during ALF. MethodsAdult male C57-BL6 mice with ALF resulting from azoxymethane-induced toxic liver injury were administered trace amounts of the endotoxin component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Effects on the magnitude of the systemic inflammatory response, liver pathology and BBB integrity were measured as a function of progression of HE, defined as time to loss of corneal reflex (coma). ResultsLipopolysaccharide caused additional two- to seven-fold (P<0.001) increases in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, IL-6), worsening liver pathology and associated increases of circulating transaminases as well as increased hyperammonaemia consistent with a further loss of viable hepatocytes. LPS treatment of ALF mice led to a rapid precipitation of hepatic coma and the BBB became permeable to the 25-kDa protein immunoglobulin G (IgG). This extravasation of IgG was accompanied by ignificant up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an endopeptidase known to modulate opening of the BBB in a wide range of neurological disorders. ConclusionsThese findings represent the first direct evidence of inflammation-related BBB permeability changes in ALF.

While it is becoming increasingly clear that homeostatic regulation of synapse function is a key principle in the nervous system, the molecular details of this regulation are only beginning to be uncovered. Recent evidence implicates molecules classically associated with the peripheral immune system in the modulation of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. In particular, the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha, class I major histocompatibility complex, and neuronal pentraxin 2 are essential in the regulation of the compensatory synaptic response that occurs in response to prolonged neuronal inactivity. This review will present and discuss current evidence implicating neuroimmune molecules in the homeostatic regulation of synapse function.

Moreover, at least half will not achieve and sustain remission following multiple pharmacological approaches. Herein, we succinctly review treatment modalities proven effective in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: We conducted a review of computerized databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) from 1980 to April 2013. Articles selected for review were based on author consensus, adequacy of sample size, the use of a standardized experimental procedure, validated assessment measures and overall manuscript quality. Results: The evidence base supporting augmentation of conventional antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics (i.e., aripiprazole, quetiapine, and olanzapine) is the most extensive and rigorous of all pharmacological approaches in TRD. Emerging evidence supports the use of some psychostimulants (i.e., lisdexamfetamine) as well as aerobic exercise. In addition, treatments informed by pathogenetic disease models provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy of immune-inflammatory based therapies and metabolic interventions. Manual based psychotherapies remain a treatment option, with the most compelling evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy. Disparate neurostimulation strategies are also available for individuals insufficiently responsive to pharmacotherapy and/or psychosocial interventions. Limitations: Compared to non-treatment-resistant depression, TRD has been less studied. Most clinical studies on TRD have focused on pharmacotherapy-resistant depression, with relatively fewer studies evaluating "next choice" treatments in individuals who do not initially respond to psychosocial and/or neurostimulatory treatments. Conclusion: The pathoetiological heterogeneity of MDD/TRD invites the need for mechanistically dissimilar, and empirically validated, treatment approaches for TRD. (C) 2013 Elsevier By.

Are misconceptions rejected and replaced by scientific conceptions, or are they still present in students' minds, coexisting with newly acquired scientific conceptions? In this study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activation between novices and experts in science when they evaluate the correctness of simple electric circuits. Results show that experts, more than novices, activate brain areas involved in inhibition when they evaluate electric circuits in which a bulb lights up, even though there is only one wire connecting it to the battery. These findings suggest that experts may still have a misconception encoded in the neural networks of their brains that must be inhibited in order to answer scientifically.

The semi-supervised paradigm introduces the concept of not only using labeled data but also unlabeled data in the learning process. Unlabeled data can be gathered at little or not cost. Hence it has the potential to reduce the need for labeling training data, a tedious and costly process. Given a weak initial recognizer trained on labeled data, self-training can be used to recognize unlabeled data and add words that were recognized with high confidence to the training set for re-training. This process is not trivial and requires great care as far as selecting the elements that are to be added to the training set is concerned. In this paper, we propose to use a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network handwritten recognition system for keyword spotting in order to select new elements. A set of experiments shows the high potential of self-training for bootstrapping handwriting recognition systems, both for modem and historical handwritings, and demonstrate the benefits of using keyword spotting over previously published self-training schemes.

Enhancement of Visual Motion Detection Thresholds in Early Deaf People	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; EARLY-BLIND; AUDITORY DEPRIVATION; HUMAN BRAIN; COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION; HEARING SIGNERS; CORTEX; LANGUAGE; INDIVIDUALS; ATTENTION	In deaf people, the auditory cortex can reorganize to support visual motion processing. Although this cross-modal reorganization has long been thought to subserve enhanced visual abilities, previous research has been unsuccessful at identifying behavioural enhancements specific to motion processing. Recently, research with congenitally deaf cats has uncovered an enhancement for visual motion detection. Our goal was to test for a similar difference between deaf and hearing people. We tested 16 early and profoundly deaf participants and 20 hearing controls. Participants completed a visual motion detection task, in which they were asked to determine which of two sinusoidal gratings was moving. The speed of the moving grating varied according to an adaptive staircase procedure, allowing us to determine the lowest speed necessary for participants to detect motion. Consistent with previous research in deaf cats, the deaf group had lower motion detection thresholds than the hearing. This finding supports the proposal that cross-modal reorganization after sensory deprivation will occur for supramodal sensory features and preserve the output functions.

TARGET-DEPENDENT EXPRESSION OF THE NETRIN-1 RECEPTOR, UNC5C, IN PROJECTION NEURONS OF THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dopamine; prefrontal cortex; nucleus accumbens; UNC5C; retrograde tracer; stereology	RAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MESOCORTICOLIMBIC DOPAMINE SYSTEM; GABA-CONTAINING NEURONS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DEFICIENT MICE; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; GLUTAMATERGIC NEURONS; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; AMPHETAMINE	We have shown previously that the netrin-1 receptor, unc-5 homologue C (UNC5C), is expressed by ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons of rodents, but only from adolescence onwards (Manitt et al., 2010; Auger et al., 2013). The goal of this study was to characterize the expression of UNC5C by these neurons. Specifically, we assessed whether UNC5C expression is selective to DA neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which undergo significant maturation during the adolescent period. To this end, we injected fluorescent retrograde tracer beads into the mPFC, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core, or NAcc lateral shell of adult male wild-type C57Bl/6J mice and processed their brains for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and UNC5C immunofluorescence 23 weeks later. VTA neurons with any combination of these immunolabels were visualized and counted using optical fractionator stereology. Our analysis revealed two main findings: (1) there are no differences in the proportions of UNC5C-positive DA neurons projecting to the mPFC, NAcc core, or NAcc lateral shell, and (2) the proportion of nonDA UNC5C-positive neurons targeting the mPFC is greater than the proportions of non-DA UNC5C-positive neurons targeting the NAcc core or lateral shell. These findings show that, contrary to our hypothesis, DA neurons projecting to the mPFC do not express UNC5C selectively. However, UNC5C expression by non-DA VTA neurons is predominantly found in those projecting to the mPFC and, as such, may play a role in their function. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Epigenomic alterations define lethal CIMP-positive ependymomas of infancy	NATURE			English	Article							ISLAND METHYLATOR PHENOTYPE; ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; GENE-EXPRESSION SIGNATURE; DRIVER MUTATIONS; GENOMIC COMPLEXITY; DISTINCT SUBGROUPS; COLORECTAL-CANCER; STEM-CELLS; MEDULLOBLASTOMA; GLIOBLASTOMA	Ependymomas are common childhood brain tumours that occur throughout the nervous system, but are most common in the paediatric hindbrain. Current standard therapy comprises surgery and radiation, but not cytotoxic chemotherapy as it does not further increase survival. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 47 hindbrain ependymomas reveals an extremely low mutation rate, and zero significant recurrent somatic single nucleotide variants. Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype. Transcriptional silencing driven by CpG methylation converges exclusively on targets of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 which represses expression of differentiation genes through trimethylation of H3K27. CpG island methylator phenotype-positive hindbrain ependymomas are responsive to clinical drugs that target either DNA or H3K27 methylation both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that epigenetic modifiers are the first rational therapeutic candidates for this deadly malignancy, which is epigenetically deregulated but genetically bland.	[Mack, S.

Network theories of memory suggest a prominent role of the hippocampus, together with unimodal sensory areas, in the build-up of conjunctive representations. The present study tested the modulatory influence of the hippocampus on neural adaptation to songs in lateral temporal areas. Patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis and healthy matched controls were presented with blocks of short songs in which lyrics and/or melodies were varied or repeated in a crossed factorial design. Neural adaptation effects were taken as correlates of incidental emergent memory traces. We hypothesized that hippocampal lesions, particularly in the left hemisphere, would weaken adaptation effects, especially the integration of lyrics and melodies. Results revealed that lateral temporal lobe regions showed weaker adaptation to repeated lyrics as well as a reduced interaction of the adaptation effects for lyrics and melodies in patients with left hippocampal sclerosis. This suggests a deficient build-up of a sensory memory trace for lyrics and a reduced integration of lyrics with melodies, compared to healthy controls. Patients with right hippocampal sclerosis showed a similar profile of results although the effects did not reach significance in this population. We highlight the finding that the integrated representation of lyrics and melodies typically shown in healthy participants is likely tied to the integrity of the left medial temporal lobe. This novel finding provides the first neuroimaging evidence for the role of the hippocampus during repetitive exposure to lyrics and melodies and their integration into a song.

Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating D	Quantitative Determination of Regional Lesion Volume and Distribution in Children and Adults with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; WHITE-MATTER; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; BRAIN; MRI; ONSET; REGISTRATION; DISABILITY; INSIGHTS; BURDEN	Introduction: Onset of MS occurs during childhood in about 5% of cases. It is unclear whether very young age at MS onset, when the nervous system is still myelinating, affects MS lesion accrual or regional distribution. Objective: To compare the frequency, volume and distribution of T2 and T1 lesions in children and adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods: Lesions were segmented on T2- and T1-weighted MRI images from 29 children and 29 adults with RRMS, matched for disease duration. Results: All subjects exhibited T2-weighted brain lesions. Children had higher whole-brain T2-weighted-lesion-volume (T2LV) compared to adults (mean (SD) in cm 3 : 12.76(2.7) vs. 10.03(3.4), p<0.0013). The supratentorial-T2LV was similar in children and adults (8.45(1.7) vs. 7.94(1.7), mean (SD), p = 0.2582), but adults were more likely to have supratentorial lesions (96.5% vs. 68.9%, p<0.012). Children were more likely to have infratentorial-T2-weighted lesions (75.9% vs. 43.4%, p<0.03), specifically in the brainstem (62.1% vs. 26.7%, p<0.019) and the pons (48.3% vs. 17.24%, p<0.024), had higher infratentorial-T2-weighted-lesion counts (4.1(5.6) vs. 1.45(2.3), p<0.021), a greater infratentorial-T2LV (4.31(2.7) vs. 2.08(2.4), p<0.0013), and a greater infratentorial-T1-weighted-lesion-volume (T1LV) (3.7(2.5) vs. 1.08(1.9), p<0.0007). Whole-brain-T1LV was higher in children (9.3(2.5) vs. 6.43(2.1), p>0.001). Adult MS patients had higher supratentorial-T1LV (5.5(0.92) vs. 6.41(2.1), mean (SD), p<0.034), whereas children were more likely to have infratentorial-T1-weighted lesions (58.6% vs. 23.3%, p<0.015). Discussion: Onset of MS during childhood is associated with a higher volume of brain lesions in the first few years of disease relative to adults. Children with MS are more likely than adults to have T2 and T1 lesions in the infratentorial white matter, raising the possibility of preferential immune targeting of more mature myelin. Children with MS have a lower supratentorial T1 lesion burden, possibly reflecting more effective remyelination and repair in brain regions that are still engaged in active primary myelination.

Contrasting results have been produced on whether or not it may act as a hypnotic agent, and the neurobiological mechanism through which it controls the vigilance states has not yet been elucidated. In this study we investigated the effect of MLT (40 mg/kg), a non-selective MT1/MT2 receptor agonist (UCM793, 40 mg/kg), and a selective MT2 partial agonist (UCM924, 40 mg/kg) on the 24-h vigilance states. EEG and EMG sleep-wake patterns were registered across the 24-h light-dark cycle in adult Sprague-Dawley male rats. MLT decreased (-37%) the latency to the first episode of non rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), enhanced the power of NREMS delta band (+33%), but did not alter the duration of any of the three vigilance states. Differently, UCM793 increased the number of episodes (+52%) and decreased the length of the episodes (-38%) of wakefulness but did not alter the 24-h duration of wakefulness, NREMS and REMS. UCM924 instead reduced the latency (-56%) and increased (+31%) the duration of NREMS. Moreover, it raised the number of REMS episodes (+57%) but did not affect REMS duration. Taken together, these findings show that MLT and non-selective MT1/MT2 receptor agonists do not increase the quantity of sleep but differently influence the three vigilance states. In addition, they support the evidence that selective MT2 receptor agonists increase NREMS duration compared to MLT and non-selective MT1/MT2 agonists. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Fault detection and isolation of a dual spool gas turbine engine using dynamic neural networks and multiple model approach	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Dynamic neural networks; Multiple model scheme; Bank of detection and isolation filters; Dual spool gas turbine engine	IDENTIFICATION	In this paper, a fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme for an aircraft jet engine is developed. The proposed FDI system is based on the multiple model approach and utilizes dynamic neural networks (DNNs) to accomplish this goal. Towards this end, multiple DNNs are constructed to learn the nonlinear dynamics of the aircraft jet engine. Each DNN corresponds to a specific operating mode of the healthy engine or the faulty condition of the jet engine. Using residuals obtained by comparing each network output with the measured jet engine output and by invoking a properly selected threshold for each network, reliable criteria are established for detecting and isolating faults in the jet engine components. The fault diagnosis task consists of determining the time as well as the location of a fault occurrence subject to presence of unmodeled dynamics, disturbances, and measurement noise. Simulation results presented demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed dynamic neural network-based FDI strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Vanini, Z. N.

However, we are still in the early days of the conceptualization of how astrocytes influence synapses, neurons, networks, and ultimately behavior. In this Perspective, our goal is to identify emerging principles governing gliotransmission and consider the specific properties of this process that endow the astrocyte with unique functions in brain signal integration. We develop and present hypotheses aimed at reconciling confounding reports and define open questions to provide a conceptual framework for future studies. We propose that astrocytes mainly signal through high-affinity slowly desensitizing receptors to modulate neurons and perform integration in spatiotemporal domains complementary to those of neurons.

Cohort 1 comprised 10 subjects with RBD (63.5 9.4 years old) and 10 healthy volunteers (62.7 8.6 years old) who underwent resting-state metabolic brain imaging with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET. Cohort 2 comprised 17 subjects with RBD (68.9 +/- 4.8 years old) and 17 healthy volunteers (66.6 +/- 6.0 years old) who underwent resting brain perfusion imaging with ethylcysteinate dimer SPECT. The latter group was followed clinically for 4.6 +/- 2.5 years by investigators blinded to the imaging results. PDRP expression was measured in both RBD groups and compared with corresponding control values.Results:PDRP expression was elevated in both groups of subjects with RBD (cohort 1: p < 0.04; cohort 2: p < 0.005). Of the 17 subjects with long-term follow-up, 8 were diagnosed with Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies; the others did not phenoconvert. For individual subjects with RBD, final phenoconversion status was predicted using a logistical regression model based on PDRP expression and subject age at the time of imaging (r(2) = 0.64, p < 0.0001).Conclusions:Latent network abnormalities in subjects with idiopathic RBD are associated with a greater likelihood of subsequent phenoconversion to a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome.

Furthermore, savant abilities, absolute pitch, and synesthesia are all more commonly found in autistic individuals than in the typical population. The mechanism of veridical mapping has been proposed to account for how enhanced perception in autism leads to the high prevalence of these three phenomena and their structural similarity. Veridical mapping entails functional rededication of perceptual brain regions to higher order cognitive operations, allowing the enhanced detection and memorization of isomorphisms between perceptual and non-perceptual structures across multiple scales. In this paper, we present FC, an autistic individual who possesses several savant abilities in addition to both absolute pitch and synesthesia-like associations. The co-occurrence in FC of abilities, some of them rare, which share the same structure, as well as FC's own accounts of their development, together suggest the importance of veridical mapping in the atypical range and nature of abilities displayed by autistic people.

In its auditory three-consonant version, trigrams are presented to participants who must recall the items in correct order after variable delays, during which an interference task is performed. The present study aimed to establish normative data for this test in the elderly French-Quebec population based on cross-sectional data from a retrospective, multi-center convenience sample. A total of 595 elderly native French-speakers from the province of Quebec performed the Memoria version of the auditory three-consonant Brown-Peterson test. For both series and item-by-item scoring methods, age, education, and, in most cases, recall after a 0-second interval were found to be significantly associated with recall performance after 10-second, 20-second, and 30-second interference intervals. Based on regression model results, equations to calculate Z scores are presented for the 10-second, 20-second and 30-second intervals and for each scoring method to allow estimation of expected performance based on participants' individual characteristics. As an important ceiling effect was observed at the 0-second interval, norms for this interference interval are presented in percentiles.

However, no study has yet investigated these aspects in female athletes using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The present study investigated the neurometabolic and -psychological effects of a concussion in the acute (7-10 days postinjury) and chronic (6 months postinjury) phases after injury. Eleven female concussed athletes and 10 female control athletes were scanned at both time points in a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Neuropsychological and symptomatic evaluations were completed at each time point. Neuropsychological alterations and a higher severity of symptoms were found in the acute phase in concussed athletes, relative to controls, but showed recovery in the chronic phase. Concussed athletes showed neurometabolic impairment in prefrontal and motor cortices characterized by a pathological increase of glutamine/glutamate and creatine (Cr) only in the chronic phase. Also, a significant decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate/Cr ratio was observed in control athletes at the second time point. Concussed female athletes showed acute cognitive alterations and higher severity of symptoms that do not appear to be underlied by neurometabolic abnormalities, which are only present in the chronic postinjury phase.

This process is not always successful, and the frequency of such cognitive failures varies to a large extent between individuals. Here we hypothesised that individual differences in cognitive failures might be reflected in inhibitory processing in the sensory cortex. To test this hypothesis, we measured GABA in human visual cortex using MR spectroscopy and found a negative correlation between occipital GABA (GABA +/Cr ratio) and cognitive failures as measured by an established cognitive failures questionnaire (CFQ). For a second site in parietal cortex, no correlation between CFQscore and GABA +/Cr ratio was found, thus establishing the regional specificity of the link between occipital GABA and cognitive failures. We further found that grey matter volume in the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) correlated with cognitive failures independently from the impact of occipital GABA and together, occipital GABA and SPL grey matter volume statistically explained around 50% of the individual variability in daily cognitive failures. We speculate that the amount of GABA in sensory areas may reflect the potential capacity to selectively suppress irrelevant information already at the sensory level, or alternatively that GABA influences the specificity of neural representations in visual cortex thus improving the effectiveness of successful attentional modulation.

NEONATAL OLFACTORY BULBECTOMY ENHANCES LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY, EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR AND BINDING OF NMDA RECEPTORS IN PRE-PUBERTAL RATS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neonatal ablation of the olfactory bulbs; locomotion; social interaction; NMDA receptor; limbic system; olfactory bulbectomy and depression	RESISTANT MAJOR DEPRESSION; DENDRITIC SPINE DENSITY; ADULT-BORN NEURONS; HOLE-BOARD TEST; POSTPUBERTAL RATS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS; EXCITOTOXIC LESIONS; SENSORY DEPRIVATION; TRANSPLANTS ENHANCE	In this study, we investigated the effect of neonatal olfactory bulbectomy (nOBX) on behavioral paradigms related to olfaction such as exploratory behavior, locomotor activity in a novel environment and social interaction. We also studied the effect of nOBX on the activity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors during development. The behavioral effects of nOBX (postnatal day 7, PD7) were investigated in pre- (PD30) and post-pubertal (PD60) Wistar rats. NMDA receptor activity was measured with [I-125]MK-801 in the brain regions associated with the olfactory circuitry. A significant increase in the novelty-induced locomotion was seen in the pre-pubertal nOBX rats. Although the locomotor effect was less marked than in pre-pubertal rats, the nOBX rats tested post-pubertally failed to habituate to the novel situation as quickly as the sham-and normal-controls. Pre-pubertally, the head-dipping behavior was enhanced in nOBX rats compared with sham-operated and normal controls, while normal exploratory behavior was observed between groups in adulthood. In contrast, social interaction was increased in post-pubertal animals that underwent nOBX. Both pre- and post-pubertal nOBX rats recovered olfaction. Interestingly, pre-pubertal rats showed a significant increase in the [I-125]MK-801 binding in the piriform cortex, dorsal hippocampus, inner and outer layers of the frontal cortex and outer layer of the cingulate cortex. At post-pubertal age, no significant differences in [I-125]MK-801 binding were observed between groups at any of the brain regions analyzed. These results suggest that nOBX produces pre-pubertal behavioral disturbances and NMDA receptor changes that are transitory with recovery of olfaction early in adulthood. (C) 2013 IBRO.

Many scaffold modifications were largely tolerated, resulting in nanomolar-potent compounds in the H3R functional assay. Exemplar compound 6s demonstrated a selective profile against a panel of 144 secondary pharmacological receptors, with activity at only sigma 2 (62% at 10 mu M). Compound 6s demonstrated free-plasma exposures above the IC50 (similar to 50x) with a brain-to-plasma ratio of similar to 3 following intravenous dosing in mice. At three doses tested in the mouse novel object recognition model (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg s.c.), 6s demonstrated a statistically significant response compared with the control group. This series represents a new scaffold of H-3 receptor antagonists that demonstrates in vivo exposure and efficacy in an animal model of cognition.

Structure of Plasticity in Human Sensory and Motor Networks Due to Perceptual Learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor adaptation; perceptual learning; plasticity; resting-state fMRI; sensorimotor network	PAIRED ASSOCIATIVE STIMULATION; PROPRIOCEPTIVE INTEGRATION; VOLUNTARY DRIVE; CORTEX; STROKE; EXCITABILITY; REPRESENTATION; MOVEMENT; MEMORY; FMRI	As we begin to acquire a new motor skill, we face the dual challenge of determining and refining the somatosensory goals of our movements and establishing the best motor commands to achieve our ends. The two typically proceed in parallel, and accordingly it is unclear how much of skill acquisition is a reflection of changes in sensory systems and how much reflects changes in the brain's motor areas. Here we have intentionally separated perceptual and motor learning in time so that we can assess functional changes to human sensory and motor networks as a result of perceptual learning. Our subjects underwent fMRI scans of the resting brain before and after a somatosensory discrimination task. We identified changes in functional connectivity that were due to the effects of perceptual learning on movement. For this purpose, we used a neural model of the transmission of sensory signals from perceptual decision making through to motor action. We used this model in combination with a partial correlation technique to parcel out those changes in connectivity observed in motor systems that could be attributed to activity in sensory brain regions. We found that, after removing effects that are linearly correlated with somatosensory activity, perceptual learning results in changes to frontal motor areas that are related to the effects of this training on motor behavior and learning. This suggests that perceptual learning produces changes to frontal motor areas of the brain and may thus contribute directly to motor learning.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the tumoral chromogranin A (CgA)-derived peptide WE-14 and the potential advantage to combine plasma WE-14 detection with the EM66 assay and the existing current CgA assay for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Compared to healthy volunteers, plasma WE-14 levels were 5.4-fold higher in patients with pheochromocytoma, but returned to normal values after surgical resection of the tumor. Determination of plasma CgA and EM66 concentrations in the same group of patients revealed that the test assays for these markers had an overall 84% diagnostic sensitivity, which is identical to that determined for WE-14. However, we found that WE-14 measurement improved the diagnostic sensitivity when combined with the results of CgA or EM66 assays. By combining the results of the three assays, the sensitivity for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was increased to 95%. In fact, the combination of WE-14 with either CgA or EM66 test assays achieved 100% sensitivity for the diagnosis of paragangliomas and sporadic or malignant pheochromocytomas if taken separately to account for the heterogeneity of the tumor. These data indicate that WE-14 is produced in pheochromocytoma and secreted into the general circulation, and that elevated plasma WE-14 levels are correlated with the occurrence of this chromaffin cell tumor. In addition, in association with other biological markers, such as CgA and/or EM66, WE-14 measurement systematically improves the diagnostic sensitivity for pheochromocytoma. These findings support the notion that granin-processing products may represent complementary tools for the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors.

Dynamic neural network-based fault diagnosis of gas turbine engines	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium of Neural Networks (ISNN)	JUL 11-14, 2012	Shenyang, PEOPLES R CHINA			Dynamic neural networks; Aircraft jet engine; Fault diagnosis; Fault detection and isolation; Computational intelligence; Multiple model schemes; Bank of filters	IDENTIFICATION	In this paper, a neural network-based fault detection and isolation (FIDI) scheme is presented to detect and isolate faults in a highly nonlinear dynamics of an aircraft jet engine. Towards this end, dynamic neural networks (DNN) are first developed to learn the input-output map of the jet engine. The DNN is constructed based on a multi-layer perceptron network which uses an IIR (infinite impulse response) filter to generate dynamics between the input and output of a neuron, and consequently of the entire neural network. The trained dynamic neural network is then utilized to detect and isolate component faults that may occur in a dual spool turbo fan engine. The fault detection and isolation schemes consist of multiple DNNs or parallel bank of filters, corresponding to various operating modes of the healthy and faulty engine conditions. Using the residuals that are generated by measuring the difference of each network output and the measured engine output various criteria are established for accomplishing the fault diagnosis task, that is addressing the problem of fault detection and isolation of the system components. A number of simulation studies are carried out to demonstrate and illustrate the advantages, capabilities, and performance of our proposed fault diagnosis scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Monoclonal antibodies against GD2, such as chimeric mAb ch14.18, have become benchmarks for neuroblastoma therapies. Pain, however, can limit immunotherapy with anti-GD2 therapeutic antibodies like ch14.18. This adverse effect is attributed to acute inflammation via complement activation on GD2-expressing nerves. Thus, new strategies are needed for the development of treatment intensification strategies to improve the outcome of these patients. Methodology/ Principal Findings: We established the mouse-human chimeric antibody c.8B6 specific to OAcGD2 in order to reduce potential immunogenicity in patients and to fill the need for a selective agent that can kill neuroblastoma cells without inducing adverse neurological side effects caused by anti-GD2 antibody immunotherapy. We further analyzed some of its functional properties compared with anti-GD2 ch14.18 therapeutic antibody. With the exception of allodynic activity, we found that antibody c.8B6 shares the same anti-neuroblastoma attributes as therapeutic ch14.18 anti-GD2 mAb when tested in cell-based assay and in vivo in an animal model. Conclusion/Significance: The absence of OAcGD2 expression on nerve fibers and the lack of allodynic properties of c.8B6-which are believed to play a major role in mediating anti-GD2 mAb dose-limiting side effects-provide an important rationale for the clinical application of c.8B6 in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

Cerebrovascular perfusion among older adults is moderated by strength training and gender	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Cerebral perfusion; Strength training; Sex; Physical activity; ASL	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE DECLINE; BRAIN PERFUSION; DEMENTIA; AGE; HYPOPERFUSION	Cerebral perfusion is important in older adults as it is linked to cognitive declines. Physical activity can improve blood flow in the body but little is known about the relationship between physical activity and cerebral perfusion in older adults. In particular, no study has investigated the relation between strength training and cerebral perfusion. We examined whether different types of physical activity (assessed with the Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity questionnaire) were associated with MRI cerebrovascular perfusion in 59 older adults. There was a significant interaction between gender and strength training, such that women who engaged in strength training (weight lifting or calisthenics) at least once per week exhibited significantly greater cerebrovascular perfusion than women who did not. This interaction remained significant after controlling for other physical activity, demographics, and health variables. These findings suggest that regular strength training can be beneficial for cerebrovascular health in women. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their main pathogenic mechanisms are thought to involve alterations in endomembrane trafficking, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism. With a combination of whole-genome mapping and exome sequencing, we identified three mutations in REEP2 in two families with HSP: a missense variant (c.107T>A [p.Va136Glu]) that segregated in the heterozygous state in a family with autosomal-dominant inheritance and a missense change (c.215T>A [p.Phe72Tyr]) that segregated in trans with a splice site mutation (c.105+3G>T) in a family with autosomal-recessive transmission. REEP2 belongs to a family of proteins that shape the endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle that was altered in fibroblasts from an affected subject. In vitro, the p.Val36Glu variant in the autosomal-dominant family had a dominant-negative effect; it inhibited the normal binding of wild-type REEP2 to membranes. The missense substitution p.Phe72Tyr, in the recessive family, decreased the affinity of the mutant protein for membranes that, together with the splice site mutation, is expected to cause complete loss of REEP2 function. Our findings illustrate how dominant and recessive inheritance can be explained by the effects and nature of mutations in the same gene. They have also important implications for genetic diagnosis and counseling in clinical practice because of the association of various modes of inheritance to this new clinico-genetic entity.

We provide a normative control-theoretic treatment of this decision that bridges economic and psychological accounts. We show how our framework applies to free-operant behavioural experiments in which subjects are required to work (depressing a lever) for sufficient total time (called the price) to receive a reward. When the microscopic benefit-of-leisure increases nonlinearly with duration, the model generates behaviour that qualitatively matches various microfeatures of subjects' choices, including the distribution of leisure bout durations as a function of the payoff. We relate our model to traditional accounts by deriving macroscopic, molar, quantities from microscopic choices.

Previously, we have shown that microRNA (miR)-34a is increased in circulating PBMC of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In the present study, we show that this microRNAs sister, miR-34c, exhibits even greater increase in both cellular and plasma components of AD circulating blood samples, compared to normal age-matched controls. Statistical analysis shows the accuracy of levels of miR-34c assayed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis: the area under the curve is 0.99 (p < 0.0001) and the 95% confidence level extends from 0.97 to 1. Pearson correlation between miR-34c levels and mild and moderate AD, as defined by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), shows an r-value of -0.7, suggesting a relatively strong inverse relationship between the two parameters. These data show that plasma levels of microRNA 34c are much more prominent in AD than those of its sister, miR-34a, or than its own level in PBMC. Transfection studies show that miR-34c, as does its sister miR-34a, represses the expression of several selected genes involved in cell survival and oxidative defense pathways, such as Bcl2, SIRT1, and others, in cultured cells. Taken together, our results indicate that increased levels of miR-34c in both PBMC and plasma may reflect changes in circulating blood samples in AD patients, compared to age-matched normal controls.

Clinimetric Evaluation of the Simpson-Angus Scale in Older Adults With Schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						rating scales; antipsychotic drugs; drug-induced parkinsonism; schizophrenia	INDUCED PARKINSONISM; DISORDERS; REFLEXES	Objective: Parkinsonism (or Parkinson's syndrome [PS]) remains common in patients exposed to antipsychotic drugs. One clinical tool used in its detection and follow-up, the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), has been under revision lately. We further examined the discriminative power of the SAS to detect PS and its efficacy as a measure of PS intensity in chronic schizophrenia. Methods: Fifty-six outpatients between 50 and 75 years of age, under stable antipsychotic drug therapy, provided consent to undergo an evaluation along the SAS and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III motor subsection, split according to the presence or absence of PS defined in the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank (UKPDSBB) criteria or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Results: The identification rate for PS was 39.3% based on UKPDSBB criteria applied to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III, compared with 62.5% and 87.5% according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and SAS cutoff value greater than 0.3, respectively. Median SAS scores for PS and PS-free participants were comparable. The SAS yielded high sensitivity (90.9%) but low specificity (17.7%). kappa Values generally revealed only slight agreement between the group allocation provided by the SAS and the UKPDSBB criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curve for screening performance of the SAS provided poor prediction of subject status. Conclusions: The SAS lacks specificity and constitutes an imperfect detection and measurement tool for PS in older adults. Raising the cutoff score would avoid inflation in PS identification. The scale is probably best used as a measure of change relative to baseline score following an intervention, but results should be interpreted with caution.

In a Phase III registrational trial, nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin demonstrated a significantly improved overall response rate, the primary endpoint, and a trend toward improved survival compared with solvent-based paclitaxel plus carboplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC. Significantly less neutropenia, neuropathy, arthralgia, and myalgia were observed with the nab-paclitaxel regimen, but the solvent-based paclitaxel regimen produced less thrombocytopenia and anemia. The clinical experience with nab-paclitaxel to date and the role of this newly approved therapy in the management of NSCLC will be summarized in this article.

Can physiological concentrations of metabolite combinations evoke sensations of fatigue and pain when injected into skeletal muscle? If so, what sensations are evoked? What is the main finding and its importance? Low concentrations of protons, lactate and ATP evoked sensations related to fatigue. Higher concentrations of these metabolites evoked pain. Single metabolites evoked no sensations. This suggests that the combination of an ASIC receptor and a purinergic P2X receptor is required for signalling fatigue and pain. The results also suggest that two types of sensory neurons encode metabolites; one detects low concentrations of metabolites and signals sensations of fatigue, whereas the other detects higher levels of metabolites and signals ache and hot. The perception of fatigue is common in many disease states; however, the mechanisms of sensory muscle fatigue are not understood. In mice, rats and cats, muscle afferents signal metabolite production in skeletal muscle using a complex of ASIC, P2X and TRPV1 receptors. Endogenous muscle agonists for these receptors are combinations of protons, lactate and ATP. Here we applied physiological concentrations of these agonists to muscle interstitium in human subjects to determine whether this combination could activate sensations and, if so, to determine how the subjects described these sensations. Ten volunteers received infusions (0.2 ml over 30 s) containing protons, lactate and ATP under the fascia of a thumb muscle, abductor pollicis brevis. Infusion of individual metabolites at maximal amounts evoked no fatigue or pain. Metabolite combinations found in resting muscles (pH 7.4 + 300 nm ATP + 1 mm lactate) also evoked no sensation. The infusion of a metabolite combination found in muscle during moderate endurance exercise (pH 7.3 + 400 nm ATP + 5 mm lactate) produced significant fatigue sensations. Infusion of a metabolite combination associated with vigorous exercise (pH 7.2 + 500 nm ATP + 10 mm lactate) produced stronger sensations of fatigue and some ache. Higher levels of metabolites (as found with ischaemic exercise) caused more ache but no additional fatigue sensation. Thus, in a dose-dependent manner, intramuscular infusion of combinations of protons, lactate and ATP leads to fatigue sensation and eventually pain, probably through activation of ASIC, P2X and TRPV1 receptors. This is the first demonstration in humans that metabolites normally produced by exercise act in combination to activate sensory neurons that signal sensations of fatigue and muscle pain.

Does the combination of a higher neural respiratory drive and greater dynamic mechanical ventilatory constraints during exercise in healthy women versus men form the mechanistic basis of sex differences in activity-related dyspnoea? What is the main finding and its importance? Sex differences in activity-related dyspnoea in health primarily reflected the awareness of a higher neural respiratory drive needed to achieve any given ventilation during exercise in the setting of relatively greater dynamic mechanical ventilatory constraints in women. These findings may have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of sex differences in exertional dyspnoea in variants of health (e.g. the elderly) and in patients with cardiorespiratory disease. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of sex differences in exertional dyspnoea. We compared detailed measures of neural respiratory motor drive [diaphragmatic EMG (EMGdi) expressed as a percentage of maximal EMGdi (EMGdi%max)], breathing pattern, operating lung volumes, dynamic respiratory mechanics [tidal oesophageal (Poes,tidal%peak) and transdiaphragmatic pressure swings (Pdi,tidal%peak) expressed as a percentage of their respective peak values] and sensory intensity and unpleasantness ratings of dyspnoea during symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise in healthy young women (n = 25) and men (n = 25). The tidal volume to forced vital capacity ratio (VT%FVC), breathing frequency, EMGdi%max, Poes,tidal%peak, Pdi,tidal%peak and sensory intensity and unpleasantness ratings of dyspnoea were higher, while dynamic inspiratory capacity and inspiratory reserve volume were lower at a standardized absolute ventilation of 55 l min-1 during submaximal exercise in women versus men (all P < 0.05). In contrast, sex had no demonstrable effect on the inter-relationships between exercise-induced increases in VT%FVC, EMGdi%max and sensory intensity and unpleasantness ratings of dyspnoea. The results of this study suggest that sex differences in the intensity and unpleasantness of exertional dyspnoea in health are likely to reflect the awareness of a relatively higher neural respiratory motor drive (or EMGdi%max) needed to achieve any given ventilation during exercise in the setting of relatively greater dynamic mechanical constraints on VT expansion in women.

Phelan McDermid syndrome involves mutations in SHANK3 which encodes a protein that forms a scaffold for glutamate receptors at the synapse. SHANK3 is one of the genes that underpins the synaptic hypothesis for ASD. We discuss this hypothesis with a view to the broader context of ASD and with special emphasis on highly penetrant genetic disorders including Shankopathies. We propose a blueprint for near and longer-term goals for fundamental and translational research on Shankopathies. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is caused by reductions in the expression level or function of a single protein, the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a translational regulator which binds to approximately 4% of brain messenger RNAs. Accumulating evidence suggests that FXS is a complex disorder of cognition, involving interactions between genetic and environmental influences, leading to difficulties in acquiring key life skills including motor skills, language, and proper social behaviors. Since many FXS patients also present with one or more features of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), insights gained from studying the monogenic basis of FXS could pave the way to a greater understanding of underlying features of multigenic ASDs. Here we present an overview of the FXS and FMRP field with the goal of demonstrating how loss of a single protein involved in translational control affects multiple stages of brain development and leads to debilitating consequences on human cognition. We also focus on studies which have rescued or improved FXS symptoms in mice using genetic or therapeutic approaches to reduce protein expression. We end with a brief description of how deficits in translational control are implicated in FXS and certain cases of ASDs, with many recent studies demonstrating that ASDs are likely caused by increases or decreases in the levels of certain key synaptic proteins. The study of FXS and its underlying single genetic cause offers an invaluable opportunity to study how a single gene influences brain development and behavior. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Other than hypoxia-inducible factor, sensors of metabolic demand remain largely unknown. During HI, anaerobic respiration is arrested resulting in accumulation of carbohydrate metabolic intermediates. As such succinate readily increases, exerting its biological effects via a specific receptor, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 91. We postulate that succinate/GPR91 enhances post-HI vascularization and reduces infarct size in a model of newborn HI brain injury. Approach and Results The Rice-Vannucci model of neonatal HI was used. Succinate was measured by mass spectrometry, and microvascular density was evaluated by quantification of lectin-stained cryosection. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Succinate levels rapidly increased in the penumbral region of brain infarcts. GPR91 was foremost localized not only in neurons but also in astrocytes. Microvascular density increased at 96 hours after injury in wild-type animals; it was diminished in GPR91-null mice leading to an increased infarct size. Stimulation with succinate led to an increase in growth factors implicated in angiogenesis only in wild-type mice. To explain the mode of action of succinate/GPR91, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E-2-prostaglandin E receptor 4, previously proposed in neural angiogenesis. Succinate-induced vascular endothelial growth factor expression was abrogated by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and a selective prostaglandin E receptor 4 antagonist. This antagonist also abolished succinate-induced neovascularization. Conclusions We uncover a dominant metabolic sensor responsible for post-HI neurovascular adaptation, notably succinate/GPR91, acting via prostaglandin E-2-prostaglandin E receptor 4 to govern expression of major angiogenic factors. We propose that pharmacological intervention targeting GPR91 could improve post-HI brain recovery.

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that mothers who experience substantial anxiety during pregnancy or the postpartum period are at increased risk for reduced initiation, exclusivity, and continuation of breastfeeding. Methods: We obtained data on 255 Canadian pregnant women from the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) study recruited between June 2004 and February 2009. We utilized data collected from 18 to 23 weeks gestation through 12 months postpartum. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess whether scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were associated with initiation, exclusivity, and continuation of breastfeeding. Results: Prenatal anxiety was not associated with breastfeeding outcomes. In adjusted models, a single point increase in HAM-A scores at 3 months postpartum was associated with an 11% reduction in the odds of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.99). A single point increase in STAI State and STAI Trait scores at 3 months postpartum was associated with a 4% (aOR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99) and 7% (aOR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86-1.00) reduction, respectively, in the odds of any breastfeeding at 12 months. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a relationship between maternal anxiety and reduced exclusivity and continuation of breastfeeding. Maternal anxiety should be actively monitored and managed appropriately in the postpartum period to support optimal breastfeeding practices.

We have investigated the role of tilt testing (TT) in predicting recurrences. Methods and Results In 136 patients enrolled in the ISSUE-3, TT was positive in 76 and negative in 60. An asystolic response predicted a similar asystolic form during implantable loop recorder monitoring, with a positive predictive value of 86%. The corresponding values were 48% in patients with non-asystolic TT and 58% in patients with negative TT (P=0.001 versus asystolic TT). Fifty-two patients (26 TT+ and 26 TT-) with asystolic neurally mediated syncope received a pacemaker. Syncope recurred in 8 TT+ and in 1 TT- patients. At 21 months, the estimated product-limit syncope recurrence rates were 55% and 5%, respectively (P=0.004). The TT+ recurrence rate was similar to that seen in 45 untreated patients (control group), which was 64% (P=0.75). The recurrence rate was similar between 14 patients with asystolic and 12 with non-asystolic responses during TT (P=0.53). Conclusions Cardiac pacing was effective in neurally mediated syncope patients with documented asystolic episodes in whom TT was negative; conversely, there was insufficient evidence of efficacy from this data set in patients with a positive TT even when spontaneous asystole was documented. Present observations are unexpected and need to be confirmed by other studies. Clinical Trial Registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01463358.

The temptation, realities, and neuroethico-legal issues of employing assessment neurotechnologies in public safety initiatives	THEORETICAL MEDICINE AND BIOETHICS			English	Article						Neurotechnology; Neuroethics; Law; Public safety; Policy; Neuroimaging; Neurogenetics		In light of the recent events of terrorism and publicized cases of mass slayings and serial killings, there have been calls from the public and policy-makers alike for neuroscience and neurotechnology (neuroS/T) to be employed to intervene in ways that define and assess, if not prevent, such wanton acts of aggression and violence. Ongoing advancements in assessment neuroS/T have enabled heretofore unparalleled capabilities to evaluate the structure and function of the brain, yet each and all are constrained by certain technical and practical limitations. In this paper, we present an overview of the capabilities and constraints of current assessment neuroS/T, address neuro-ethical and legal issues fostered by the use and potential misuse of these approaches, and discuss how neuroethics may inform science and the law to guide right and sound applications of neuroS/T to ``deliver us from evil'' while not being led into temptations of ampliative claims and inapt use.

A critical literature review was performed to evaluate the level and quality of evidence supporting the efficacy of this procedure. METHODS: Systematic reviews of the EMBASE, PubMed and CENTRAL databases were conducted to retrieve all articles published over a 15-year period (1996 to 2010) reporting medium-to long-term outcomes (minimum six months follow-up) of laparoscopic fundoplication for the treatment of pediatric GERD. Articles were critically appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale and the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Extracted outcomes included GERD recurrence, need for reoperation, postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 5302 articles were retrieved. Thirty-six studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria, including five prospective (level 2b), four retrospective comparative (level 3b) and 27 case series (level 4). No studies compared laparoscopic fundoplication with medical treatment. Thirty-six per cent of studies did not describe the symptoms used to suspect GERD; 11% did not disclose the diagnostic modalities used; and 41% did not report the findings of diagnostic modalities. Only 17% of studies provided a definition of recurrence, and only 14% attempted to control for confounding variables. The follow-up intervals were inconsistently reported, ranging between two months and nine years. Significant heterogeneity among studies limited the ability to pool outcomes. Mean (+/- SD) recurrence rates varied between 0% and 48 +/- 19.6% of patients. Reoperation was required in 0.69 +/- 0.95% to 17.7 +/- 8.4% of patients. Mortality ranged between 0% and 24 +/- 16.7%. CONCLUSION: The level and quality of the evidence supporting laparoscopic fundoplication are extremely poor. Higher-quality data are required before the procedure can be considered to be an effective intervention in the treatment of pediatric GERD.

The role of oxytocin in cardiovascular regulation	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Review						Oxytocin; Natriuretic peptides; Heart; Cardiomyogenesis	ATRIAL-NATRIURETIC-PEPTIDE; SPONTANEOUSLY HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; IN-VITRO; CARDIAC OXYTOCIN; VOLUME-EXPANSION; HEART-FAILURE; CARDIOMYOCYTES; RECEPTORS	Studies of body volume expansion have indicated that lesions of the anteroventral third ventricle and median eminence block the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) into the circulation. Detailed analysis of the lesions showed that activation of oxytocin (OT)-ergic neurons is responsible for ANP release, and it has become clear that activation of neuronal circuitry elicits OT secretion into the circulation, activating atrial OT receptors and ANP release from the heart. Subsequently, we have uncovered the entire functional OT system in the rat and the human heart. An abundance of OT has been observed in the early development of the fetal heart, and the capacity of OT to generate cardiomyocytes (CMs) has been demonstrated in various types of stem cells. OT treatment of mesenchymal stem cells stimulates paracrine factors beneficial for cardioprotection. Cardiovascular actions of OT include: i) lowering blood pressure, ii) negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, iii) parasympathetic neuromodulation, iv) vasodilatation, v) anti-inflammatory activity, vi) antioxidant activity, and vii) metabolic effects. OT actions are mediated by nitric oxide and ANP. The beneficial actions of OT may include the increase in glucose uptake by CMs and stem cells, reduction in CM hypertrophy, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial protection of several cell types. In experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats, continuous in vivo OT delivery improves cardiac healing and cardiac work, reduces inflammation, and stimulates angiogenesis. Because OT plays anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective roles and improves vascular and metabolic functions, it demonstrates potential for therapeutic use in various pathologic conditions.

Using the proposed technique, the amount of the neural data transmitted off the implant is compressed by a factor of at least 63 at the expense of as low as 4.66% RMS error between the signal reconstructed on the external host and the original neural signal on the implant side. Based on the proposed idea, a 128-channel WHT processor was designed in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process occupying 1.64 mm(2) of silicon area. The circuit consumes 81 mu(W) over bar (0.63 mu(W) over bar per channel) from a 1.8-V power supply at 250 kHz. A prototype of the proposed processor was implemented and successfully tested using prerecorded neural signals.

However, nothing is known regarding the effects of sGC on adult germline methylome and whether these effects can be transmitted to the next generation. We hypothesized that administration of sGC to adult male mice alters DNA methylation in mature sperm and modifies the transcription and methylation of steroid receptors in male F 1 offspring. Adult C57BL/6 males (n = 10/group) were injected on five consecutive days with 1 mg/kg sGC (i.e., dexamethasone) or vehicle and euthanized 35 or 60 days after initial treatment or bred with control females (60 days postinitial treatment; n = 5/group). A significant increase in global non-CpG methylation was observed in F 0 sperm 60 days following sGC treatment. In the hippocampus and kidney of Postnatal Day 50 (PND50) and PND240 male offspring derived from fathers exposed to sGC, significant differences in mineralocorticoid receptor (Nr3c2; Mr), estrogen alpha receptor (Nr3a1; Ers1), and glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1; Gr) expression were observed. Furthermore, significant demethylation in regulatory regions of Mr, Gr, and Esr1 was observed in the PND50 kidney derived from fathers exposed to sGC. This is the first demonstration that paternal pharmacological exposure to sGC can alter the expression and DNA methylation of nuclear steroid receptors in brain and somatic tissues of offspring. These findings provide proof of principle that adult male exposure to sGC can affect DNA methylation and gene expression in offspring, indicating the possibility that adult experiences that evoke increases in endogenous glucocorticoid (i.e., stress) might have similar effects.

Because the presumed epileptogenic focus is patient-specific, an appropriate source/detector (SD) montage has to be reconfigured for each patient. The combination of EEG and fNIRS, however, entails several constraints on montages, and finding an optimal arrangement of optodes on the cap is an important issue. We present a method for computing an optimal SD montage on an EEG/fNIRS cap that focuses on one or several specific brain regions; the montage maximizes the spatial sensitivity. We formulate this optimization problem as a linear integer programming problem. The method was evaluated on two EEG/fNIRS caps. We simulated absorbers at different locations on a head model and generated realistic optical density maps on the scalp. We found that the maps of optimal SD montages had spatial resolution properties comparable to those of regular SD arrangements for the whole head with significantly fewer sensors than regular SD arrangements. In addition, we observed that optimal montages yielded improved spatial density of fNIRS measurements over the targeted regions together with an increase in signal-to-noise ratio.

Bispectral index was used as the control variable for hypnosis, the analgoscore for analgesia, and phonomyography for neuromuscular blockade. McSleepy can be used to control the induction, maintenance and emergence from general anesthesia. To do so, a large touch screen is used to provide a user friendly interface, permitting bidirectional communication: the user giving information about the different stages of anesthesia, and the system prompting the anesthesiologist to perform certain actions such as mask ventilation, intubation or waking-up the patient using audio clips with voice commands. Several safety features were implemented to provide a secure and reliable anesthesia. Preliminary results of 15 patients are presented in this paper. Evaluation of McSleepy was done through an assessment of its clinical performance and using Varvel's performance indices. The system was found to be clinically useful by providing good precision in drug administration and reliable results for the duration of a general anesthesia.

The injection of notexin into, or the layering of notexin onto, the muscles of affected sheep resulted in necrosis followed by regeneration of muscle fibres with the expression of both non-muscle isoforms of phosphorylase within the fibres and a reduction of the amount of glycogen in the muscle with an increase in the strength of contraction and a decrease in fatiguability in the muscle fibres. The sustained re-expression of both the brain and liver isoforms of phosphorylase within the muscle fibres provides further emphasis that strategies to enhance the re-expression of these isoforms should be investigated as a possible treatment for McArdle disease.

A total of 9,796 dream reports were collected and the content of 253 nightmares and 431 bad dreams reported by 331 participants was investigated. Physical aggression was the most frequently reported theme in nightmares, whereas interpersonal conflicts predominated in bad dreams. Nightmares were rated by participants as being substantially more emotionally intense than were bad dreams. Thirtyfive percent of nightmares and 55% of bad dreams contained primary emotions other than fear. When compared to bad dreams, nightmares were more bizarre and contained substantially more aggressions, failures, and unfortunate endings. Conclusions: The results have important implications on how nightmares are conceptualized and defined and support the view that when compared to bad dreams, nightmares represent a somewhat rarer-and more severe-expression of the same basic phenomenon.

Through learning, practice, and exposure, controlled processes can become automatic; however, whether automatic processes can become deautomatized - recuperated under the purview of control - remains unclear. Here we show that a suggestion derails a deeply ingrained process involving involuntary audiovisual integration. We compared the performance of highly versus less hypnotically suggestible individuals (HSIs versus LSIs) in a classic McGurk paradigm - a perceptual illusion task demonstrating the influence of visual facial movements on auditory speech percepts. Following a posthypnotic suggestion to prioritize auditory input, HSIs but not LSIs manifested fewer illusory auditory perceptions and correctly identified more auditory percepts. Our findings demonstrate that a suggestion deautomatized a ballistic audiovisual process in HSIs. In addition to guiding our knowledge regarding theories and mechanisms of automaticity, the present findings pave the road to a more scientific understanding of top-down effects and multisensory integration.

However, robust application of MI to deformable registration is challenging mainly because rich structural information, which are critical cues for successful deformable registration, are not incorporated into MI. We propose a self-similarity weighted graph-based implementation of alpha-mutual information (alpha-MI) for nonrigid image registration. We use a self-similarity measure that uses local structural information and is invariant to rotation and to local affine intensity distortions, and therefore the new Self Similarity alpha-MI (SeSaMI) metric inherits these properties and is robust against signal nonstationarity and intensity distortions. We have used SeSaMI as the similarity measure in a regularized cost function with B-spline deformation field to achieve nonrigid registration. Since the gradient of SeSaMI can be derived analytically, the cost function can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient descent methods. We show that SeSaMI produces a robust and smooth cost function and outperforms the state of the art statistical based similarity metrics in simulation and using data from image-guided neurosurgery.

The platform is based on target cell adhesion onto the micro-fabricated interfaces produced by microcontact printing of cell-specific antibodies. Results show over 95% separation efficiency in less than 10 min for the separation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and cardiomyocytes from rat brain and heart mixtures, respectively. Target cell attachment and single cell spreading can be precisely controlled on the basis of the designed patterns. Both cell types can maintain their biofunctionality. Indeed, isolated OPCs can proliferate and differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, while isolated cardiomyocytes retain their contractile properties on the separation platform. Successful separation of two dissimilar cell types present in varying concentrations in their respective cell mixtures and the demonstration of their integrity after separation open new avenues for time and cost-effective sorting of various cell types using the developed miniaturized platform.

Severe forms of Baraitser-Winter syndrome are caused by ACTB mutations rather than ACTG1 mutations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						Baraitser-Winter syndrome; Fryns-Aftimos syndrome; pachygyria; intellectual disability; cytoplasmic actins	FRONTO-FACIAL SYNDROME; BETA-ACTIN	ACTB and ACTG1 mutations have recently been reported to cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS) - a rare condition characterized by ptosis, colobomata, neuronal migration disorder, distinct facial anomalies and intellectual disability. One of the patients carrying an ACTB mutation was previously diagnosed with Fryns-Aftimos syndrome (FAS), which is a rare and severe, multiple congenital anomaly (MCA) syndrome whose symptoms partially overlap with that of BRWS. However, several patients with Fryns-Aftimos were considered not to fit into the ACTB and ACTG1 spectrum because of their severe impairment and additional malformations. We report on three patients who had been diagnosed with FAS. All three patients carry a mutation in the ACTB gene. On the basis of the ACTB mutations and analysis of the clinical findings, we reclassify the diagnosis of these patients as severe BRWS. We suggest that mutations in ACTB cause a distinctly more severe phenotype than ACTG1 mutations, despite the structural similarity of beta- and gamma-actins and their overlapping expression pattern. We expand the spectrum of BRWS and confirm that FAS is not a separate entity but an early and severe manifestation of BRWS.

Glutamate release in the ventromedial hypothalamus of the female rat during copulation: Modulation by estradiol	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sexual behavior; Estradiol; Progesterone; Microdialysis; VMH; Glutamate	VAGINAL-CERVICAL STIMULATION; SEXUAL-BEHAVIORS; PREOPTIC AREA; VAGINOCERVICAL STIMULATION; REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR; ESTRUS TERMINATION; ESTROUS BEHAVIOR; LORDOSIS REFLEX; MEDIAL AMYGDALA; MESSENGER-RNA	Binding of glutamate or its ionotropic receptor agonists in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of female rats inhibits both appetitive and consummatory aspects of sexual behavior. Because vaginocervical stimulation activates glutamate neurons in the VMH, and administration of estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P) delays this effect, the present study examined the effects of hormonal priming on glutamate release within the VMH of female rats paired with sexually vigorous males. Ovariectomized, sexually experienced rats were implanted with guide cannula aimed at the ventrolateral VMH, through which microdialysis probes were inserted prior to testing. Females were assigned randomly to one of three hormone treatment conditions: EB + P, LB alone, or the oil vehicle. Testing was conducted over 5 h, including a 120-min period of habituation to the testing chamber, a 60-min period of baseline sample collection, and a 120-min period during which a sexually vigorous male was introduced into the testing chamber. Dialysates were collected every 20 min during the test and were " analyzed for glutamate using HPLC. Females primed with oil had large and significant increases in glutamate release from baseline once the male was introduced to the chamber. Treatment with LB alone decreased glutamate release in response to male cues. Although treatment with EB + P did not differ significantly from EB alone, the degree of reduced glutamate release was less than with EB alone. These results indicate that priming with EB reduces glutamate transmission in the VMH in response to male cues. Taken together with our previous findings, estradiol blunts the activation of glutamate neurons in the VMH thus allowing female rats to copulate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Our objective was to evaluate preferences associated with grade I/II and grade III/IV chemotherapy side effects among breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. We also assessed trade-offs that patients are willing to make between treatment side effects and the route and schedule of treatment administration. Methods. In this cross-sectional study, patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer completed a one-time Web survey. Conjoint analysis was used to elicit preferences for 17 grade I/II and III/IV side effects associated with available chemotherapies and regimens. In the analysis, the risk of each side effect was increased by 5%, holding all others constant, and the respective impact on patient preferences was identified. Results. A total of 102 women participated (mean age 54611). Among the grade I/II side effects, a 5% reduction in the risk of sensory neuropathy, nausea, and motor neuropathy had the highest impact on preferences. Among grade III/IV side effects, motor neuropathy, nausea/vomiting, and myalgia made the most difference. An oral twice-daily regimen was most preferred; however, patients were willing to receive an intravenous regimen relative to oral to avoid an increased risk of 5% in the majority of side effects. Avoiding an increased chance of grade III/IV motor neuropathy was associated with willingness to tolerate one of the least preferred administration schedules. Conclusion. This study identified relative preferences among both mild/moderate to severe side effects from the patient perspective. Patients appear to be willing to make trade-offs between side effects and different regimens. These findings may help to inform medical decision-making processes.

Insights into the Initiation of JC Virus DNA Replication Derived from the Crystal Structure of the T-Antigen Origin Binding Domain	PLOS PATHOGENS			English	Article							PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY; LARGE TUMOR-ANTIGEN; HUMAN POLYOMAVIRUS JC; SINGLE-STRANDED-DNA; VIRAL ORIGIN; CORE ORIGIN; IN-VITRO; DOUBLE HEXAMERS; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; SV40 ORIGIN	JC virus is a member of the Polyomavirus family of DNA tumor viruses and the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a disease that occurs primarily in people who are immunocompromised and is usually fatal. As with other Polyomavirus family members, the replication of JC virus (JCV) DNA is dependent upon the virally encoded protein T-antigen. To further our understanding of JCV replication, we have determined the crystal structure of the origin-binding domain (OBD) of JCV T-antigen. This structure provides the first molecular understanding of JCV T-ag replication functions; for example, it suggests how the JCV T-ag OBD site-specifically binds to the major groove of GAGGC sequences in the origin. Furthermore, these studies suggest how the JCV OBDs interact during subsequent oligomerization events. We also report that the OBD contains a novel pocket; which sequesters the A1 & B2 loops of neighboring molecules. Mutagenesis of a residue in the pocket associated with the JCV T-ag OBD interfered with viral replication. Finally, we report that relative to the SV40 OBD, the surface of the JCV OBD contains one hemisphere that is highly conserved and one that is highly variable. Author Summary Polyomaviruses have been invaluable tools for biomedical research into basic cellular processes. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that members of this family are also involved in human diseases, particularly among the immunocompromised and the elderly. The subject of this study, the JC virus (JCV), is a member of this family and the causative agent of a brain disease termed Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), a disease that is often fatal and for which there is no cure. Herein we present the high-resolution crystal structure of the origin binding domain (OBD) from the JCV initiator protein large T-antigen. Furthermore, we propose a molecular model for the oligomerization of the JCV T-antigen OBD that is based upon the crystal structure. We also report a novel pocket that modeling studies suggest is available when the OBD is site-specifically bound to DNA and therefore may represent a possible starting point for structure-based drug design.

Prenatal abnormal features of the fourth ventricle in Joubert syndrome and related disorders	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						cerebellar vermis; ciliopathy; molar tooth sign; MRI; posterior fossa; ultrasound	MOLAR TOOTH SIGN; POSTERIOR-FOSSA; DIAGNOSIS; SONOGRAPHY; ULTRASOUND; VENTRICLE	Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) are characterized by absence or underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis and a malformed brainstem. This family of disorders is a member of an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies. We describe the abnormal features of the brain, particularly the fourth ventricle, in seven fetuses affected by JSRD. In three cases abnormality of the fourth ventricle was isolated and in four cases there were associated malformations. The molar tooth sign (MTS) was always present and visible on two-dimensional ultrasound and, when performed, on three-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The fourth ventricle was always abnormal, in both axial and sagittal views, presenting pathognomonic deformities. It is important to identify JSRD, preferably prenatally or at least postnatally, due to its high risk of recurrence of about 25%. A detailed prenatal assessment of the fourth ventricle in several views may help to achieve this goal. Copyright (C) 2013 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Medical textbooks have traditionally suggested that 10% of PHEOS are heritable. However, the frequency of heritable PHEO has been underestimated. Three syndromic conditions-Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-and three genes-subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex: SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD-are established causes of hereditary PHEO-PGL. In the last few years, four new genes (SDHA, SDHAF2, MAX, and TMEM127) have been found to be associated with predisposition to these tumours. The present review, illustrated by three case reports, gives an update of the genetic basis of PHEO-PGL and of the parent-of-origin effect implicated in the transmission of SDHD and SDHAF2. We discuss the referral criteria that should guide the decision to offer genetic testing to affected patients. We also specify the genes that are most likely implicated-based on particular features such as malignancy, bilateralism, or childhood-onset-to help geneticists efficiently order appropriate genetic tests. Finally, we review the screening recommendations for carriers of a PHEO-pgl predisposition mutation.	[Lefebvre, M.; Foulkes, W.

It shows the most highly differentiated topographic maps of the receptor array of all these senses. It is organized into three maps in the hindbrain that are, in turn, composed of columns, each consisting of six pyramidal cell classes. The cells in each column have different spatiotemporal processing properties yielding a total of 18 topographic representations of the body surface. The differential filtering by the hindbrain maps is used by superimposed maps in the multilayered midbrain electrosensory region to extract specific stimulus features related to communication and foraging. At levels beyond the midbrain, topographic mapping of the body surface appears to be lost.

Increased Expression of Cutaneous alpha(1)-Adrenoceptors After Chronic Constriction Injury in Rats	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						alpha(1)-adrenoceptors; nociceptors; neuropathic pain; chronic constriction injury; keratinocytes; sensory-sympathetic coupling	COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN; SYMPATHETICALLY MAINTAINED PAIN; CHRONIC POSTISCHEMIA PAIN; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; C-FIBER NOCICEPTORS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SCIATIC-NERVE; ADRENERGIC SENSITIVITY; INTRADERMAL INJECTION	alpha(1)-Adrenoceptor expression on nociceptors may play an important role in sympathetic-sensory coupling in certain neuropathic pain syndromes. The aim of this study was to determine whether alpha(1)-adrenoceptor expression was upregulated on surviving peptidergic, nonpeptidergic, and myelinated nerve fiber populations in the skin after chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve in rats. Seven days after surgery, alpha(1)-adrenoceptor expression was upregulated in the epidermis and on dermal nerve fibers in plantar skin ipsilateral to the injury but not around blood vessels. This alpha(1)-adrenoceptor upregulation in the plantar skin was observed on all nerve fiber populations examined. However, alpha(1)-adrenoceptor expression was unaltered in the dorsal hind paw skin after the injury. The increased expression of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on cutaneous nociceptors in plantar skin after chronic constriction injury suggests that this may be a site of sensory-sympathetic coupling that increases sensitivity to adrenergic agonists after nerve injury. In addition, activation of upregulated alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in the epidermis might cause release of factors that stimulate nociceptive signaling. Perspective: Our findings indicate that peripheral nerve injury provokes upregulation of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors on surviving nociceptive afferents and epidermal cells in the skin. This might contribute to sympathetically maintained pain in conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, painful diabetic neuropathy, and postherpetic neuralgia.

SEARCHING FOR PULSARS USING IMAGE PATTERN RECOGNITION	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: data analysis; pulsars: general; stars: neutron; techniques: image processing	CANDIDATES; DISCOVERY	In the modern era of big data, many fields of astronomy are generating huge volumes of data, the analysis of which can sometimes be the limiting factor in research. Fortunately, computer scientists have developed powerful datamining techniques that can be applied to various fields. In this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (AI) program that identifies pulsars from recent surveys by using image pattern recognition with deep neural nets-the PICS (Pulsar Image-based Classification System) AI. The AI mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interference by looking for patterns from candidate plots. Different from other pulsar selection programs that search for expected patterns, the PICS AI is taught the salient features of different pulsars from a set of human-labeled candidates through machine learning. The training candidates are collected from the Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (PALFA) survey. The information from each pulsar candidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of image data with up to thousands of pixels. The AI takes these data from each candidate as its input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its similar to 9000 neurons. The deep neural networks in this AI system grant it superior ability to recognize various types of pulsars as well as their harmonic signals. The trained AI's performance has been validated with a large set of candidates from a different pulsar survey, the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey. In this completely independent test, the PICS ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-related candidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars and 208 of their harmonics, in the top 961 (1%) of 90,008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. The first non-pulsar candidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. In other words, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while 80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. The performance of this system can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. This AI system has been integrated into the PALFA survey pipeline and has discovered six new pulsars to date.	[Zhu, W. W.; Berndsen, A.; Madsen, E. C.; Tan, M.; Stairs, I.

Combined insular and striatal dopamine dysfunction are associated with executive deficits in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment	BRAIN			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; mild cognitive impairment; positron emission tomography; dopamine	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; VESICULAR MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; HUMAN-BRAIN; METHAMPHETAMINE USERS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; 457 BINDING	The ability to dynamically use various aspects of cognition is essential to daily function, and reliant on dopaminergic transmission in cortico-striatal circuitry. Our aim was to investigate both striatal and cortical dopaminergic changes in patients with Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment, who represent a vulnerable group for the development of dementia. We hypothesized severe striatal dopamine denervation in the associative (i.e. cognitive) region and cortical D2 receptor abnormalities in the salience and executive networks in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment compared with cognitively normal patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy control subjects. We used positron emission tomography imaging with dopaminergic ligands C-11-dihydrotetrabenazine, to investigate striatal dopamine neuron integrity in the associative subdivision and C-11-FLB 457, to investigate cortical D2 receptor availability in patients with Parkinson's disease (55-80 years of age) with mild cognitive impairment (n = 11), cognitively normal patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 11) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 14). Subjects were administered a neuropsychological test battery to assess cognitive status and determine the relationship between dopaminergic changes and cognitive performance. We found that patients with mild cognitive impairment had severe striatal dopamine depletion in the associative (i.e. cognitive) subdivision as well as reduced D2 receptor availability in the bilateral insula, a key cognitive hub, compared to cognitively normal patients and healthy subjects after controlling for age, disease severity and daily dopaminergic medication intake. Associative striatal dopamine depletion was predictive of D2 receptor loss in the insula of patients with Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment, demonstrating interrelated striatal and cortical changes. Insular D2 levels also predicted executive abilities in these patients as measured using a composite executive z-score obtained from neuropsychological testing. Furthermore we assessed cortical thickness to ensure that D2 receptor changes were not confounded by brain atrophy. There was no difference between groups in cortical thickness in the insula, or any other cortical region of interest. These findings suggest that striatal dopamine denervation combined with insular D2 receptor loss underlie mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and in particular decline in executive function. Furthermore, these findings suggest a crucial and direct role for dopaminergic modulation in the insula in facilitating cognitive function.

However, excessive neuronal synchronization is often the hallmark of epileptic activity in both generalized and partial epileptic disorders. Here, I will review the synchronizing mechanisms involved in generating epileptiform activity in the limbic system, which is closely involved in the pathophysiogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). TLE is often associated to a typical pattern of brain damage known as mesial temporal sclerosis, and it is one of the most refractory adult form of partial epilepsy. This epileptic disorder can be reproduced in animals by topical or systemic injection of pilocarpine or kainic acid, or by repetitive electrical stimulation; these procedures induce an initial status epilepticus and cause 1-4 weeks later a chronic condition of recurrent limbic seizures. Remarkably, a similar, seizure-free, latent period can be identified in TLE patients who suffered an initial insult in childhood and develop partial seizures in adolescence or early adulthood. Specifically, I will focus here on the neuronal mechanisms underlying three abnormal types of neuronal synchronization seen in both TLE patients and animal models mimicking this disorder: (i) interictal spikes; (ii) high frequency oscillations (80-500 Hz); and (iii) ictal (i.e., seizure) discharges. In addition, I will discuss the relationship between interictal spikes and ictal activity as well as recent evidence suggesting that specific seizure onsets in the pilocarpine model of TLE are characterized by distinctive patterns of spiking (also termed preictal) and high frequency oscillations.

Child age, sex, prenatal maternal anxiety, and difficult temperament were tested as sources of sensitivity, that is, factors that may make children more sensitive to stressful life events. Analyses were based on data from 10,417 children from a prospective, longitudinal study of child development. At ages 4, 7, 9, 11, and 16 years, stressful events and psychological difficulties were measured. Prenatal anxiety was measured at 32 weeks of gestation and difficult temperament was measured at 6 months. Children exposed to stressful events showed significantly increased psychological difficulties at ages 7 and 11 years; there was consistent evidence of a reciprocal pattern: psychological difficulties predicted stressful events at each stage. Analyses also indicated that the associations between stressful events and psychological difficulties were stronger in girls than in boys. We found no evidence for the hypothesis that prenatal anxiety or difficult temperament increased stress sensitivity, that is, moderated the link between life events and psychological difficulties. The findings extend prior work on stress exposure and psychological difficulties and highlight the need for additional research to investigate sources of sensitivity and the mechanisms that might underlie differences in sensitivity to stressful events.

CLNA diet was compared with three other dietary fats: (1) conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; c9-t11-18:2 + t10-c12-18:2), (2) non-conjugated n-3 PUFA and (3) n-6 PUFA. Thirty-two piglets weaned at 3 weeks of age were distributed into four dietary groups. Diets were isoenergetic and food intake was controlled by a gastric tube. Mono-CLNA diet did not significantly change body or organ weight, carcass composition and most biochemical parameters including; glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, hepatic enzymes and electrolytes levels in blood (P >= 0.09). Conversely, the n-3 PUFA composition of the brain, liver and heart decreased by 6-21% in the CLNA-fed group compared to animals fed nonconjugated n-3 PUFA (P < 0.01). Responses to dietary treatments were tissue-specific, with the liver and the brain being the most deprived in n-3 PUFA. Our results support that short-term intake of mono-CLNA is safe in neonatal pigs but n-3 PUFA reduction in tissues deserves to be further investigated before using long-term nutritional supplementation in pigs and other animal models and before moving to clinical trials.

Early identification and treatment prevent the most dramatic clinical sequelae of the disorder, but new neurodevelopmental and psychological problems have emerged in individuals treated from birth. The additional unanticipated recognition of a toxic effect of elevated maternal phenylalanine on fetal development has added to a general call in the field for treatment for life. Two major conferences sponsored by the National Institutes of Health held > 10 years apart reviewed the state of knowledge in the field of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, but there are no generally accepted recommendations for therapy. The purpose of this guideline is to review the strength of the medical literature relative to the treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and to develop recommendations for diagnosis and therapy of this disorder. Evidence review from the original National Institutes of Health consensus conference and a recent update by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was used to address key questions in the diagnosis and treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency by a working group established by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. The group met by phone and in person over the course of a year to review these reports, develop recommendations, and identify key gaps in our knowledge of this disorder. Above all, treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency must be life long, with a goal of maintaining blood phenylalanine in the range of 120-360 mu mol/l. Treatment has predominantly been dietary manipulation, and use of low protein and phenylalanine medical foods is likely to remain a major component of therapy for the immediate future. Pharmacotherapy for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency is in early stages with one approved medication ( sapropterin, a derivative of the natural cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase) and others under development. Eventually, treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency will be individualized with multiple medications and alternative medical foods available to tailor therapy. The primary goal of therapy should be to lower blood phenylalanine, and any interventions, including medications, or combination of therapies that help to achieve that goal in an individual, without other negative consequences, should be considered appropriate therapy. Significant evidence gaps remain in our understanding of the optimal therapies for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, nonphenylalanine effects of these therapies, and long-term sequelae of even welltreated disease in children and adults.

Implantable Biomedical Microsystems: A New Graduate Course in Biomedical Circuits and Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						Biomedical circuits and systems; curriculum development; implantable devices; integrated microsystems; wireless interfacing	ENGINEERING COURSE	After more than two decades of research on the design and development of implantable biomedical microsystems, it is time now to organize research achievements in this area in a consolidated and pedagogical form. This paper introduces a new graduate course in advanced biomedical circuits and systems. Designed for graduate students with electrical and biomedical engineering backgrounds, this course provides a general overview of the multidisciplinary field of implantable biomedical microsystems. In addition to some introductory material on physiology and biology where needed, this course comprises extensive contents and in-depth discussions on both system-and circuit-level aspects of the design of implantable microsystems. Moreover, this course also deals with issues surrounding design for implantability and testability. Wireless interfacing, signal processing, microelectrode array fabrication, and circuit design for implantable neural recording microsystems are studied extensively. Various design aspects of neural stimulation microsystems, cochlear implants, and visual prostheses are also reviewed briefly.

However, the relations between GM and WM measures and their contributions to clinical features remain in doubt. In this study, we acquired high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging along with structural magnetic resonance imaging data on 20 patients with clinical evidence of ALS and 21 matched healthy controls. WM microstructural metrics and cortical thickness were measured to characterize the whole brain WM and GM degenerative patterns. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was used to reconstruct the tracts from the WM regions characterized by fractional anisotropy (FA) decrease in patients. Decreased FA and increased radial diffusivity was observed in WM regions of the bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) and callosal motor fibers in the ALS patients, while the superior longitudinal fasciculus exhibited a changing trend. Cortical thinning was found in the anatomically congruent regions, including the motor-related cortices (i.e., bilateral precentral gyri, dorsal premotor cortices, and left supplementary motor area), prefrontal and occipito-parietal regions. However, there was no significant relationship between FA reduction and cortical thinning. Finally, patients with faster clinical progression showed more severe cortical thinning of the left precentral gyrus and FA reduction of the left CST. Together, these findings suggest that ALS is multisystem degeneration involving both the widespread cortices and the underlying WM fibers. GM and WM changes might play distinct roles in the disease progression.

Recent findings indicate, however, that, in turn, the efficacy of TMS depends on the state of ongoing cortical oscillations. Whereas power and phase of electro-myographic (EMG) activity recorded from the hand muscles as well as neural synchrony between cortex and hand muscles are known to influence the effect of TMS, to date, no study has shown an influence of the phase of cortical oscillations during wakefulness. We applied single-pulse TMS over the motor cortex and recorded motor-evoked potentials along with the electroencephalogram (EEG) and EMG. We correlated phase and power of ongoing EEG and EMG signals with the motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. We also investigated the functional connectivity between cortical and hand muscle activity (corticomuscular coherence) with the MEP amplitude. EEG and EMG power and phase in a frequency band around 18 Hz correlated with the MEP amplitude. High beta-band (similar to 34 Hz) corticomuscular coherence exhibited a positive linear relationship with the MEP amplitude, indicating that strong synchrony between cortex and hand muscles at the moment when TMS is applied entails large MEPs. Improving upon previous studies, we demonstrate a clear dependence of TMS-induced motor effects on the state of ongoing EEG phase and power fluctuations. We conclude that not only the sampling of incoming information but also the susceptibility of cortical communication flow depends cyclically on neural phase.

DesignLongitudinal cohort study. SettingOutpatient clinics, Quebec, Canada. ParticipantsIndividuals aged 60 and older without dementia or depression (n=102). MeasurementsUsing baseline and 1-year follow-up data, four measures of anticholinergic burden (anticholinergic component of the Drug Burden Index (DBI-Ach), Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB), Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS), and Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS)) were applied. Three models of cognitive decline (worsening of raw neuropsychological test scores, Reliable Change Index (RCI), and a standardized regression based measure (SRB)) were compared in relation to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria for the onset of a new mild neurocognitive disorder. The consistency of associations was examined using logistic regression. ResultsThe frequency of identifying individuals with an increase in anticholinergic burden over 1year varied from 18% with the DBI-Ach to 23% with the ACB. The frequency of identifying cognitive decline ranged from 8% to 86% using different models. The raw change score had the highest sensitivity (0.91), and the RCI the highest specificity (0.93) against DSM-V criteria. Memory decline using the SRB method was associated with an increase in ACB (odds ratio (OR)=5.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-25.8), ADS (OR=5.7, 95% CI=1.1-27.7), and ARS (OR=6.5, 95% CI=1.34-32.3). An increase in the DBI-Ach was associated with a decline on memory testing using the raw change score method (OR=4.2, 95% CI=1.8-15.4) and on the Trail-Making Test Part B using SRB (OR=2.9, 95% CI=1.1-8.0). No associations were observed using the DSM-V criteria or RCI method. ConclusionThe choice of different methods for defining drug exposure and cognitive decline will have a significant effect on the results of pharmacoepidemiological studies.

Recent studies have indicated that TWEAK-Fn14 axis signaling may contribute to chronic autoimmune diseases. TWEAK expression via microglia in cortical lesions, presence of TWEAK(+) macrophages in inflamed leptomeninges, and absence of TWEAK/Fn14 expression in healthy brain implicates importance of this pathway in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis lesions. TWEAK-Fn14 axis blockade has also shown promise in various multiple sclerosis animal models. Stimulation of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway can result in activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappa B signaling and could also stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Here, we have reviewed evidence of the possible role of TWEAK-Fn14 axis in pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) via neuroinflammation, tissue remodeling, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neurodegeneration, and astrogliosis.

Method: We reviewed the medical records of 252 consecutive patients who underwent VNS implantation at a single center over a 5-year period. Patients with complete 6- and 12-month follow-up data were included. Analysis was also done across various subgroups including gender, age at implantation, seizure type, abnormal MRI findings pre-implantation, number of medications at baseline, history of SE, and duration of epilepsy. Results: Complete follow-up data were available for 69 patients. Median seizure reduction for these patients was 50% (Q1: 0%; Q3: 73%) at 6 months and 40% (Q1: -25%; Q3: 75%) at 12 months. When stratified by baseline seizure frequency, there was a significant reduction from baseline of 61% at 6 months and 69% at 12 months for patients in the high-baseline frequency group. There were no significant reductions at month 6 or 12 months for the lower-baseline frequency group. Adverse events were reported in 40.6% (28 out of 69 patients). Six patients had the VNS removed for reasons including lack of efficacy and side effects and were excluded from the study group. Conclusion: VNS provides significant seizure reduction, in particular in pediatric patients with a higher baseline seizure frequency. (C) 2013 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rivest, F; Kalaska, JF; Bengio, Y				Rivest, Francois; Kalaska, John F.; Bengio, Yoshua			Conditioning and time representation in long short-term memory networks	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Time representation learning; Temporal-difference learning; Long short-term memory networks; Dopamine; Conditioning; Reinforcement learning	PARAMETRIC WORKING-MEMORY; MONKEY DOPAMINE NEURONS; DELAYED-RESPONSE TASK; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REINFORCEMENT SIGNAL; RECURRENT NETWORKS; REWARD-PREDICTION; PREMOTOR CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; MODEL	Dopaminergic models based on the temporal-difference learning algorithm usually do not differentiate trace from delay conditioning. Instead, they use a fixed temporal representation of elapsed time since conditioned stimulus onset. Recently, a new model was proposed in which timing is learned within a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network representing the cerebral cortex (Rivest et al. in J Comput Neurosci 28(1):107-130, 2010). In this paper, that model's ability to reproduce and explain relevant data, as well as its ability to make interesting new predictions, are evaluated. The model reveals a strikingly different temporal representation between trace and delay conditioning since trace conditioning requires working memory to remember the past conditioned stimulus while delay conditioning does not. On the other hand, the model predicts no important difference in DA responses between those two conditions when trained on one conditioning paradigm and tested on the other. The model predicts that in trace conditioning, animal timing starts with the conditioned stimulus offset as opposed to its onset. In classical conditioning, it predicts that if the conditioned stimulus does not disappear after the reward, the animal may expect a second reward. Finally, the last simulation reveals that the buildup of activity of some units in the networks can adapt to new delays by adjusting their rate of integration. Most importantly, the paper shows that it is possible, with the proposed architecture, to acquire discharge patterns similar to those observed in dopaminergic neurons and in the cerebral cortex on those tasks simply by minimizing a predictive cost function.

J	Cardoso, C; Ellenbogen, MA; Linnen, AM				Cardoso, Christopher; Ellenbogen, Mark A.; Linnen, Anne-Marie			The Effect of Intranasal Oxytocin on Perceiving and Understanding Emotion on the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT)	EMOTION			English	Article						oxytocin; MSCEIT; emotion recognition; social salience; faces	BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; EMPATHIC ACCURACY; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; NEURAL BASES; RECOGNITION; HUMANS; AMYGDALA	Evidence suggests that intranasal oxytocin enhances the perception of emotion in facial expressions during standard emotion identification tasks. However, it is not clear whether this effect is desirable in people who do not show deficits in emotion perception. That is, a heightened perception of emotion in faces could lead to "oversensitivity" to the emotions of others in nonclinical participants. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of intranasal oxytocin on emotion perception using ecologically valid social and nonsocial visual tasks. Eighty-two participants (42 women) self-administered a 24 IU dose of intranasal oxytocin or a placebo in a double-blind, randomized experiment and then completed the perceiving and understanding emotion components of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. In this test, emotion identification accuracy is based on agreement with a normative sample. As expected, participants administered intranasal oxytocin rated emotion in facial stimuli as expressing greater emotional intensity than those given a placebo. Consequently, accurate identification of emotion in faces, based on agreement with a normative sample, was impaired in the oxytocin group relative to placebo. No such effect was observed for tests using nonsocial stimuli. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that intranasal oxytocin enhances the salience of social stimuli in the environment, but not nonsocial stimuli. The present findings support a growing literature showing that the effects of intranasal oxytocin on social cognition can be negative under certain circumstances, in this case promoting "oversensitivity" to emotion in faces in healthy people.

By contrast, high-grade gliomas in children and adolescents have remained a relatively under-investigated disease. The latest large-scale genomic and epigenomic profiling studies have yielded an unprecedented abundance of novel data and provided deeper insights into gliomagenesis across all age groups, which has highlighted key distinctions but also some commonalities. As we are on the verge of dissecting glioblastomas into meaningful biological subgroups, this Review summarizes the hallmark genetic alterations that are associated with distinct epigenetic features and patient characteristics in both paediatric and adult disease, and examines the complex interplay between the glioblastoma genome and epigenome.

The variant allele Valine at codon 129 of the Prnp was associated with decreased brain volume in healthy volunteers and schizophrenic patients. We investigate the association between the cerebellum volume and the presence of variant allele Valine at codon 129 of the Prnp gene in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). The Prnp coding sequence was determined in 41 refractory MTLE-HS patients. The cerebellum volume corrected by the intracranial volume of patients with the normal Prnp genotypes was compared with that of patients presenting the variant alleles at codon 129. Twenty patients showed the Met129Met genotype, 16 showed Met129Val, and 5 had Val129Val. There were no association among clinical, demographic, electrophysiological, antiepileptic drugs used, and the presence of the Prnp variant alleles. The presence of Prnp variant allele at codon 129 was not associated with the analyzed cerebellum volume. Prnp variant alleles at codon 129 are not associated with cerebellum volume in patients with refractory MTLE-HS.

Phosphorylation of tau protein at sites Ser(396-404) is one of the earliest events in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome	NEUROPATHOLOGY AND APPLIED NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; cleavage; Down syndrome; early event; phosphorylation; tau	PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; CASPASE-CLEAVAGE; PATHOLOGY; BRAIN; EVOLUTION; DEMENTIA; TANGLES; CORE	AimsPhosphorylation, conformational changes and cleavage of tau protein have been widely suggested to contribute to abnormal tau processing in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as well as in other tauopathies. Consistently, many phosphorylated sites, such as Ser(199-202)-Thr(205) and Ser(396-404), have been associated with this pathological processing. The present study examined the chronological appearance of phosphorylation during the neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) evolution in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Down syndrome. MethodsImmunohistochemistry for modified tau [phosphorylated at Ser(199-202)-Thr(205) (AT8) and Ser(396-404) (PHF-1) or truncated at D-421 (TauC3) and E-391 (MN423)] was performed on paraffin-embedded human brain sections. Double immunofluorescence for phosphorylated and truncated tau was used to detect intensity and distribution of tau immunoreactivity, and provided detailed characterization of NFT pathology. ResultsPhosphorylation at sites Ser(396-404) was significantly increased when compared with phosphorylations at sites Ser(199-202)-Thr(205). Around 50% of the total structures containing phosphorylation at sites Ser(396-404) were found as early phospho-tau aggregates with a well-preserved neuronal soma. Phosphorylation of tau protein at sites Ser(396) coexists with early and late truncation events. Tau abnormal processing in Down syndrome consistently showed similar alterations as observed in AD. ConclusionPhosphorylation of tau protein at the carboxyl terminus may be among the earliest tau events, and it occurs prior to the apparition of the classical fibrillar structure. Finally, these data validate PHF-1 as an efficient marker for AD cytopathology following the progression of tau aggregation into NFT.

Low serotonin may make them susceptible to lowered mood. This work aims to study the acute effects on mood and impulsivity of lowering serotonin levels with acute tryptophan depletion in polydrug ecstasy users and to determine whether effects were different in men and women. In a double-blind cross-over study, participants who had used ecstasy at least 25 times (n = 13) and nonuser controls (n = 17) received a tryptophan-deficient amino acid mixture and a control amino acid mixture containing tryptophan, at least 1 week apart. Mood was measured using the profile of mood states, and impulsivity was measured with the Go/No-Go task. The main result shows that a lowering of mood after acute tryptophan depletion occurred only in female polydrug ecstasy users (n = 7), relative to controls (n = 9). Results from the Go/No-Go task suggested that impulsivity was not increased by acute tryptophan depletion in polydrug ecstasy users. The group sizes were small, when males and females were considered separately. Women polydrug ecstasy users appear to be more susceptible than men to the effects of lowered serotonin levels. If use of ecstasy alone or in conjunction with other drugs causes progressive damage of serotonin neurons, women polydrug ecstasy users may become susceptible to clinical depression.

An inception cohort was followed over the first post-stroke year. Group-based trajectory analysis, a form of latent class analysis, was used to identify distinctive groups of individuals with similar trajectories. Dual trajectories were used to estimate concordance between participation trajectory and trajectories for each of the three constructs under study. From the sample of 102 persons (mean age 70), four trajectories of participation were identified, two of which were qualified as excellent and very good, and two qualified as fair and poor. All those with excellent walking showed excellent participation. However, people with excellent (and very good) community participation had a range of walking capacities. Most (82 %) people with normal mood showed excellent participation. People with good mood but not meeting norms for age showed the complete range of participation trajectories from excellent to poor. The higher proportion of people with excellent or good social support (57 %) showed excellent participation. Two treatable component causes of participation, walking capacity and mood, were identified; of these, only excellent walking capacity could be considered a sufficient cause.

While spinal cord injury has no treatment either, nerve injuries are being treated with autologous grafts, a procedure that in turn translates into a loss of function in the donor area. The development of therapies for these pathologies has become urgent as population keeps on ageing. A promising direction of investigation is the use of regenerative techniques to re-grow healthy and functional tissue in the injured area. In this review article, various approaches currently investigated to promote neural regeneration are covered. Those include approaches based on (and many times combining) stem cell therapy, scaffolds made of hydrogel, electrospun fibers and conductive materials as well as the use of soluble or non-diffusible growth factors.

A significant proportion of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not improve following treatment with first-line antidepressants and, currently, there are no objective indicators of predictors of antidepressant response. The aim of this study was to investigate pre-treatment peripheral gene expression differences between future remitters and non-responders to citalopram treatment and identify potential pharmacogenomic predictors of response. Methods. We conducted a gene expression study using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus2 microarrays in peripheral blood samples from untreated individuals with MDD (N = 77), ascertained at a community outpatient clinic, prior to an 8-week treatment with citalopram. Gene expression differences were assessed between remitters and non-responders to treatment. Technical validation of significant probesets was carried out by qRT-PCR. Results. A total of 434 probesets displayed significant correlation to change in score and 33 probesests were differentially expressed between eventual remitters and non-responders. Probesets for SMAD 7 (SMA- and MAD-related protein 7) and SIGLECP3 (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin, pseudogene 3) were the most significant differentially expressed genes following FDR correction, and both were down-regulated in individuals who responded to treatment. Conclusions. These findings point to SMAD7 and SIGLECP3 as candidate predictive biomarkers of antidepressant response.

To derive a theoretical model reconciling the controversial findings in the literature. Methods: Initial PubMed, MEDLINE (1946 to 5 May 2012) and PsycINFO (1806 to first week June 2012) searches on recovery mechanisms from aphasia, whether treatment-related or not, retrieved a total of 35 English language articles. Articles, cross-referenced in this initial set were also reviewed if they met the inclusion criteria, thus resulting in a total of 42 articles included in this review. Main outcomes: Recruitment of the right hemisphere during recovery from aphasia can be effective if it occurs during a critical time window post-stroke. The recruitment's effectiveness will depend on the lesion's location, extent and permanence. Preservation of core language processing areas will generate minimal right hemisphere recruitment and vice versa. Some experimental studies seem to suggest that the improvement linked to a particular hemisphere can be modulated by specific therapy methods. Conclusion: The specific conditions in which effective right recruitment takes place may have important implications for rehabilitation treatment. These findings could lead to improved recovery in people suffering from aphasia. However, more research with non-invasive brain stimulation is needed.

Netrin 1 and Dcc signalling are required for confinement of central axons within the central nervous system	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Netrin 1; Dcc; Spinal cord; CNS exit; Unc5; Axonal confinement; Mouse	CULTURED MAMMALIAN EMBRYOS; GROWTH-CONE ATTRACTION; RAT SPINAL-CORD; COMMISSURAL AXONS; C-ELEGANS; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; SONIC HEDGEHOG; MOTOR AXONS; EXPRESSION; GUIDANCE	The establishment of anatomically stereotyped axonal projections is fundamental to neuronal function. While most neurons project their axons within the central nervous system (CNS), only axons of centrally born motoneurons and peripherally born sensory neurons link the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) together by navigating through specialized CNS/PNS transition zones. Such selective restriction is of importance because inappropriate CNS axonal exit could lead to loss of correct connectivity and also to gain of erroneous functions. However, to date, surprisingly little is known about the molecular-genetic mechanisms that regulate how central axons are confined within the CNS during development. Here, we show that netrin 1/Dcc/Unc5 chemotropism contributes to axonal confinement within the CNS. In both Ntn1 and Dcc mutant mouse embryos, some spinal interneuronal axons exit the CNS by traversing the CNS/PNS transition zones normally reserved for motor and sensory axons. We provide evidence that netrin 1 signalling preserves CNS/PNS axonal integrity in three ways: (1) netrin 1/Dcc ventral attraction diverts axons away from potential exit points; (2) a Dcc/Unc5c-dependent netrin 1 chemoinhibitory barrier in the dorsolateral spinal cord prevents interneurons from being close to the dorsal CNS/PNS transition zone; and (3) a netrin 1/Dcc-dependent, Unc5c-independent mechanism that actively prevents exit from the CNS. Together, these findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that maintain CNS/PNS integrity and, to the best of our knowledge, present the first evidence that chemotropic signalling regulates interneuronal CNS axonal confinement in vertebrates.

Dendrite architecture organized by transcriptional control of the F-actin nucleator Spire	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Neuron; Drosophila; Dendrite; Arborization; F-actin; Nociception; Sholl	FINGER PROTEIN ABRUPT; DROSOPHILA LARVAE; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; SENSORY NEURONS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; LOLA ENCODES; AXON GROWTH; SPINAL-CORD; CELL; MORPHOGENESIS	The architectures of dendritic trees are crucial for the wiring and function of neuronal circuits because they determine coverage of receptive territories, as well as the nature and strength of sensory or synaptic inputs. Here, we describe a cell-intrinsic pathway sculpting dendritic arborization (da) neurons in Drosophila that requires Longitudinals Lacking (Lola), a BTB/POZ transcription factor, and its control of the F-actin cytoskeleton through Spire (Spir), an actin nucleation protein. Loss of Lola from da neurons reduced the overall length of dendritic arbors, increased the expression of Spir, and produced inappropriate F-actin-rich dendrites at positions too near the cell soma. Selective removal of Lola from only class IV da neurons decreased the evasive responses of larvae to nociception. The increased Spir expression contributed to the abnormal F-actin-rich dendrites and the decreased nocifensive responses because both were suppressed by reduced dose of Spir. Thus, an important role of Lola is to limit expression of Spir to appropriate levels within da neurons. We found Spir to be expressed in dendritic arbors and to be important for their development. Removal of Spir from class IV da neurons reduced F-actin levels and total branch number, shifted the position of greatest branch density away from the cell soma, and compromised nocifensive behavior. We conclude that the Lola-Spir pathway is crucial for the spatial arrangement of branches within dendritic trees and for neural circuit function because it provides balanced control of the F-actin cytoskeleton.

We assessed the benefits of surveillance MRI and more specifically spine MRI in a contemporary cohort. We evaluated MRI results of children diagnosed with CNS tumors from January 2000 to December 2011. Children with at least one surveillance MRI following the diagnosis of medulloblastoma (MB), atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), pineoblastoma (PB), supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor, supratentorial high-grade glioma (World Health Organization grade III-IV), CNS germ cell tumors or ependymoma were included. A total of 2,707 brain and 1,280 spine MRI scans were obtained in 258 patients. 97 % of all relapses occurred in the brain and 3 % were isolated to the spine. Relapse was identified in 226 (8 %) brain and 48 (4 %) spine MRI scans. The overall rate of detecting isolated spinal relapse was 9/1,000 and 7/1,000 for MB patients. MRI performed for PB showed the highest rate for detecting isolated spinal recurrence with 49/1,000. No initial isolated spinal relapse was identified in patients with glioma, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor and ATRT. Isolated spinal recurrences are infrequent in children with malignant CNS tumors and the yield of spine MRI is very low. Tailoring surveillance spine MRI to patients with higher spinal relapse risk such as PB, MB with metastatic disease and within 3 years of diagnosis could improve allocation of resources without compromising patient care.

Concerns about extreme peritumoral edema and its ensuing surgical and perioperative complications led the authors to use the bilateral fronto-orbito-nasal approach to remove midline anterior skull base meningiomas that were larger than 4 cm. The authors hypothesize that extreme vasogenic edema exemplified by finger-like hyperintensities extending into the bifrontal white matter and external capsule and/or the extreme capsule, coined the lion's mane sign (LMS), would help identify patients with a challenging postoperative course. They hypothesize that the LMS would better predict symptomatic postoperative cerebral edema than the edema index (EI). Methods. This is an observational case series of 9 patients. The authors noted the grade, pathology, tumor volume, El, and the presence or absence of the LMS in all tumors. They used the intensive unit care (ICU) length of stay as a nonspecific measure reflecting postoperative symptomatic cerebral edema. Comparisons of edema-related postoperative complications and the El were made between patients with and without an LMS. Results. Bifrontal hyperintensities, extending into at least three-eighths of the length of the external capsules on T2-weighted MRI, seen in 4 of 9 patients, portended a longer postoperative ICU stay. The presence of an LMS better predicted postoperative complications related to cerebral edema than tumor grade, pathology, volume, or EI. Conclusions. The LMS predicts an increased duration of stay in the ICU after a bilateral fronto-orbito-nasal approach for resection of large and giant anterior skull base meningiomas. Furthermore, the LMS better predicted increased length of stay in the ICU than did the EI.

In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture designed to embed multi-relational graphs into a flexible continuous vector space in which the original data is kept and enhanced. The network is trained to encode the semantics of these graphs in order to assign high probabilities to plausible components. We empirically show that it reaches competitive performance in link prediction on standard datasets from the literature as well as on data from a real-world knowledge base (WordNet). In addition, we present how our method can be applied to perform word-sense disambiguation in a context of open-text semantic parsing, where the goal is to learn to assign a structured meaning representation to almost any sentence of free text, demonstrating that it can scale up to tens of thousands of nodes and thousands of types of relation.

Process Simulation and Control Optimization of a Blast Furnace Using Classical Thermodynamics Combined to a Direct Search Algorithm	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B-PROCESS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on CFD Modeling and Simulation in Materials Processing held during the TMS Annual Meeting and Exhibition	MAR 11-15, 2012	Orlando, FL	Minerals, Met & Mat Soc (TMS), Assoc Iron & Steel Technol, Minerals, Met & Mat Soc (TMS), Extract & Proc Div, Proc Technol & Modeling Comm, Minerals, Met & Mat Soc (TMS), Mat Proc & Mfg Div, Solidificat Comm			HIGH-TEMPERATURE EQUILIBRIA; AMORPHOUS-CARBON; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; NEURAL-NETWORK; MELTING-POINT; GRAPHITE; CRYSTALLIZATION; HEAT; DIAMOND; COKES	Several numerical approaches have been proposed in the literature to simulate the behavior of modern blast furnaces: finite volume methods, data-mining models, heat and mass balance models, and classical thermodynamic simulations. Despite this, there is actually no efficient method for evaluating quickly optimal operating parameters of a blast furnace as a function of the iron ore composition, which takes into account all potential chemical reactions that could occur in the system. In the current study, we propose a global simulation strategy of a blast furnace, the 5-unit process simulation. It is based on classical thermodynamic calculations coupled to a direct search algorithm to optimize process parameters. These parameters include the minimum required metallurgical coke consumption as well as the optimal blast chemical composition and the total charge that simultaneously satisfy the overall heat and mass balances of the system. Moreover, a Gibbs free energy function for metallurgical coke is parameterized in the current study and used to fine-tune the simulation of the blast furnace. Optimal operating conditions and predicted output stream properties calculated by the proposed thermodynamic simulation strategy are compared with reference data found in the literature and have proven the validity and high precision of this simulation.

The independent variables in the model are chemical compositions (C, Mn, Nb, Mo, Ti, N, Cu, P, S, Si, Al, V), austenitizing temperature, initial austenite grain size and cooling rate over the temperature range of the occurrence of phase transformations. For purpose of constructing these models, 138 different experimental data were gathered from the literature. The data used in the ANN model are arranged in a format of fourteen input parameters that cover the chemical compositions, initial austenite grain size and cooling rate, and output parameter which is transformation start temperature. In this model, the training and testing results in the ANN have shown strong potential for prediction of effects of chemical compositions and heat treatments on phase transformation of microalloyed steels.

A neural network approach for optimal software testing and maintenance	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Software release; Maintenance; Neural networks	OPTIMAL ALLOCATION; RESOURCE; COST	In this paper, we propose a neural network-based model for optimal software testing and maintenance policy, where the software testing environment and the operational environment are characterized by an environmental factor. We also present a systematic study for defect detection and correction processes. In our proposed approach, we consider the logistic growth curve model and the constant correction time for defect prediction. Then, we estimate the jointly optimal software testing period and maintenance limit via minimization of a software cost function that takes into account the environmental factor and the imperfect fault removal. More precisely, the total expected cost is formulated via a discrete-type software reliability model based on the difference between operational environments, imperfect defect removal, and defect correction process. Experimental results on a real software data set are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in defect prediction as well as in determining the jointly optimal testing period and planned maintenance limit.

Whilst imaging studies have investigated the neural activation patterns in this region involved in intero- and exteroceptive awareness, the underlying biochemical mechanisms still remain unclear. In order to investigate these, a well-established fMRI task targeting interoceptive awareness (heartbeat counting) and exteroceptive awareness (tone counting) was combined with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Controlling for physiological noise, neural activity in the insula during intero- and exteroceptive awareness was confirmed in an independent data sample using the same fMRI design. Focussing on MRS values from the left insula and combining them with neural activity during intero- and exteroceptive awareness in the same healthy individuals, we demonstrated that GABA concentration in a region highly involved in interoceptive processing is correlated with neural responses to interoceptive stimuli, as opposed to exteroceptive stimuli. In addition, both GABA and interoceptive signal changes in the insula predicted the degree of depressed affect, as measured by the Beck Hopelessness Scale. On the one hand, the association between GABA concentration and neural activity during interoceptive awareness provides novel insight into the biochemical underpinnings of insula function and interoception. On the other, through the additional association of both GABA and neural activity during interoception with depressed affect, these data also bear potentially important implications for psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety, where GABAergic deficits, altered insula function and abnormal affect coincide.

Quantification of the impact of a confounding variable on functional connectivity confirms anti-correlated networks in the resting-state	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state; Global average signal; Functional connectivity; Default Mode Network; Dorsal attention network; Task positive network; General Linear Model	GLOBAL SIGNAL REGRESSION; BOLD SIGNAL; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; BRAIN NETWORKS; DEFAULT MODE; FMRI; NOISE; ANTICORRELATIONS; MRI	The effect of regressing out the global average signal (GAS) in resting state fMRI data has become a concern for interpreting functional connectivity analyses. It is not clear whether the reported anti-correlations between the Default Mode and the Dorsal Attention Networks are intrinsic to the brain, or are artificially created by regressing out the GAS. Here we introduce a concept, Impact of the Global Average on Functional Connectivity (IGAFC), for quantifying the sensitivity of seed-based correlation analyses to the regression of the GAS. This voxel-wise IGAFC index is defined as the product of two correlation coefficients: the correlation between the GAS and the fMRI time course of a voxel, times the correlation between the GAS and the seed time course. This definition enables the calculation of a threshold at which the impact of regressing-out the GAS would be large enough to introduce spurious negative correlations. It also yields a post-hoc impact correction procedure via thresholding, which eliminates spurious correlations introduced by regressing out the GAS. In addition, we introduce an Artificial Negative Correlation Index (ANCI), defined as the absolute difference between the IGAFC index and the impact threshold. The ANCI allows a graded confidence scale for ranking voxels according to their likelihood of showing artificial correlations. By applying this method, we observed regions in the Default Mode and Dorsal Attention Networks that were anti-correlated. These findings confirm that the previously reported negative correlations between the Dorsal Attention and Default Mode Networks are intrinsic to the brain and not the result of statistical manipulations. Our proposed quantification of the impact that a confound may have on functional connectivity can be generalized to global effect estimators other than the GAS. It can be readily applied to other confounds, such as systemic physiological or head movement interferences, in order to quantify their impact on functional connectivity in the resting state.

Inhibitors targeting these two enzymes have been described, including URB597 and URB602, respectively. Several recent studies examining the contribution of CB1 and/or CB2 receptors on the peripheral antinociceptive effects of AEA, 2-AG, URB597 and URB602 in neuropathic pain conditions using either pharmacological tools or transgenic mice separately have been reported, but the exact mechanism is still uncertain. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated in 436 male C57BL/6, cnr1KO and cnr2KO mice in the presence or absence of cannabinoid CB1 (AM251) or CB2 (AM630) receptor antagonists in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. Peripheral subcutaneous injections of AEA, 2-AG, WIN55,212-2 (WIN; a CB1/CB2 synthetic agonist), URB597 and URB602 significantly decreased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. These effects were inhibited by both cannabinoid antagonists AM251 and AM630 for treatments with 2-AG, WIN and URB602 but only by AM251 for treatments with AEA and URB597 in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, the antinociceptive effects for AEA and URB597 were observed in cnr2KO mice but absent in cnr1KO mice, whereas the effects of 2-AG, WIN and URB602 were altered in both of these transgenic mice. Complementary genetic and pharmacological approaches revealed that the anti-hyperalgesic effects of 2-AG and URB602 required both CBI and CB2 receptors, but only CB2 receptors mediated its anti-allodynic actions. The antinociceptive properties of AEA and URB597 were mediated only by CBI receptors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The endocannabinoid system is an attractive therapeutic target for immune system modulation and peripheral pain management. While CB1R is distributed in the nervous system, CB2R has traditionally been associated to the immune system. This dogma is currently a subject of debate since the discovery of CB2R expression in neurons using antibody-based methods. The localization of CB2R in the central nervous system (CNS) could have a significant impact on drug development because it would mean that in addition to its effects on the peripheral pain pathway, CB2R could also mediate some central effects of cannabinoids. In an attempt to clarify the debate over CB2R expression in the CNS, we tested several commercially or academically produced CB2R antibodies using Western blot and immunohistochemistry on retinal tissue obtained from wild-type mice and mice lacking CB2R (cnr2 (-/-) ). One of the antibodies tested exhibited a valuable specificity as it marked a single band near the predicted molecular weight in Western blot and produced no staining in cnr2 (-/-) mice retina sections. The other antibodies tested detected multiple bands in Western blot and labeled unidentified proteins when used with their immunizing peptide or on cnr2 (-/-) retinal sections. We conclude that many commonly used antibodies raised against CB2R are not specific for use in immunohistochemistry, at least in the context of the mouse retina. Moreover, some of them tested presented significant lot-to-lot variability. Hence, caution should be used when interpreting prior and future studies using CB2R antibodies.

The effects of dietary saturated fat on basal hypothalamic neuroinflammation in rats	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						Obesity; Inflammation; Saturated fat diet; Sickness behavior; Cytokines	INTERLEUKIN-1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; INDUCED INSULIN-RESISTANCE; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-4; INDUCED OBESITY; TISSUE INFLAMMATION; DIABETES-MELLITUS; FEBRILE RESPONSE; INNATE IMMUNITY; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; FEVER	Recent evidence has demonstrated that consumption of high fat diets can trigger brain inflammation and subsequent injury in the absence of any peripheral inflammatory signaling. Here we sought to investigate whether a link exists between the concentration of highly saturated fats in the diet and the development of inflammation in the brain of rats and, whether the source of the saturated fat was an important factor in this process. Adult male rats had access to diets with a moderate level of total fat (32% of calories as fat) varying in level of saturated fat [low (20%) vs high (>60%)1 and its source (butter or coconut oil). After 8 weeks of diet exposure peripheral and central tissues were collected for analysis of inflammatory signals. Neither blood nor white adipose tissue exhibited any changes in inflammatory mediators regardless of the saturated fat content or the source. In the brain however, we observed significant hypothalamic upregulation of the expression of markers of glial activation as well as of interleukin (IL)-1,6 and nuclear factor (NF)-IL-6, which were highest in the group fed the butter-based diets. The increase in these inflammatory mediators had no effect on basal body temperature or the temperature response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The present results indicate that hypothalamic inflammation associated with consumption of diets high in fat is directly linked to the saturated fat content as well as the source of that fat. These effects are likely linked to other pathophysiological changes in the regulation of metabolism. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we investigated the source and contribution of adipose tissue derived cytokines and the cytokine-like hormone leptin to age-related changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced brain-controlled sickness-responses. Old (24 months) and young (2 months) rats were challenged with LPS or saline alone or in combination with a neutralizing leptin antiserum (LAS) or control serum. Changes in the sickness-response were monitored by biotelemetry. Additionally, ex vivo fat-explants from young and old rats were stimulated with LPS or saline and culture medium collected and analyzed by cytokine-specific bioassays/ELISAs. We found enhanced duration/degree of the sickness-symptoms, including delayed but prolonged fever in old rats. This response was accompanied by increased plasma-levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1ra and exaggerated expression of inflammatory markers in brain and liver analyzed by RTPCR including inhibitor kappa B alpha, microsomal prostaglandin synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 (brain). Moreover, for the first time, we were able to show prolonged elevated plasma leptin-levels in LPS-treated old animals. Treatment with LAS in young rats tended to attenuate the early- and in old rats the prolonged febrile response. Fat-explants exhibited unchanged IL-6 but reduced IL-1ra and tumor necrosis factor (TNE)-alpha release from adipose tissue of aged compared to young animals. In addition, we found increased expression of the endogenous immune regulator microRNA146a in aged animals suggesting a role for these mediators in counteracting brain inflammation. Overall, our results indicate a role of adipose tissue and leptin in "aging-related-inflammation" and age-dependent modifications of febrile-responses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Toward a More Sophisticated Response Representation in Theories of Medial Frontal Performance Monitoring: The Effects of Motor Similarity and Motor Asymmetries	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						anterior cingulate; error correction; error-related negativity; inhibition; motor representation	ERROR-RELATED-NEGATIVITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; FINGER MOVEMENTS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL SYSTEM; CONFLICT; TASK; COMPONENTS	Cognitive control in the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) is formulated in models that emphasize adaptive behavior driven by a computation evaluating the degree of difference between 2 conflicting responses. These functions are manifested by an event-related brain potential component coined the error-related negativity (ERN). We hypothesized that the ERN represents a regulative rather than evaluative pMFC process, exerted over the error motor representation, expediting the execution of a corrective response. We manipulated the motor representations of the error and the correct response to varying degrees. The ERN was greater when 1) the error response was more potent than when the correct response was more potent, 2) more errors were committed, 3) fewer and slower corrections were observed, and 4) the error response shared fewer motor features with the correct response. In their current forms, several prominent models of the pMFC cannot be reconciled with these findings. We suggest that a prepotent, unintended error is prone to reach the manual motor processor responsible for response execution before a nonpotent, intended correct response. In this case, the correct response is a correction and its execution must wait until the error is aborted. The ERN may reflect pMFC activity that aimed to suppress the error.

The objectives of this study are (1) to define the neuroradiologic pattern in a cohort of POLR3A and POLR3B subjects and (2) to compare the neuroradiologic pattern of Pol III-related leukodystrophies with other hypomyelinating disorders. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of 13 patients with POLR3A and POLR3B mutations and of 14 patients with other hypomyelinating disorders were analyzed. All the subjects with Pol III-related leukodystrophies presented hypomyelination associated with T2 hypointensity of the thalami and/or the pallida. Twelve subjects (92%) presented T2 hypointensity of the optic radiations. Cerebellar atrophy was observed in most patients (92%). The combination of the analyzed criteria identified patients with Pol III-related leukodystrophies with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 92.9%.

Hybrid fault diagnosis of nonlinear systems using neural parameter estimators	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Nonlinear systems; Neural estimators; Hybrid approach	SATELLITES FORMATION FLIGHT; LIKELIHOOD RATIO APPROACH; ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION; STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS; UNCERTAIN SYSTEMS; STATE ESTIMATION; FILTERS; SENSOR; MAINTENANCE; ALGORITHMS	This paper presents a novel integrated hybrid approach for fault diagnosis (FD) of nonlinear systems taking advantage of both the system's mathematical model and the adaptive nonlinear approximation capability of computational intelligence techniques. Unlike most FD techniques, the proposed solution simultaneously accomplishes fault detection, isolation, and identification (FDII) within a unified diagnostic module. At the core of this solution is a bank of adaptive neural parameter estimators (NPEs) associated with a set of single-parameter fault models. The NPEs continuously estimate unknown fault parameters (FPs) that are indicators of faults in the system. Two NPE structures, series parallel and parallel, are developed with their exclusive set of desirable attributes. The parallel scheme is extremely robust to measurement noise and possesses a simpler, yet more solid, fault isolation logic. In contrast, the series parallel scheme displays short FD delays and is robust to closed-loop system transients due to changes in control commands. Finally, a fault tolerant observer (FTO) is designed to extend the capability of the two NPEs that originally assumes full state measurements for systems that have only partial state measurements. The proposed FTO is a neural state estimator that can estimate unmeasured states even in the presence of faults. The estimated and the measured states then comprise the inputs to the two proposed FDII schemes. Simulation results for FDII of reaction wheels of a three-axis stabilized satellite in the presence of disturbances and noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDII solutions under partial state measurements.

In order to assess the safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous protein C concentrate and suggest recommendations for future use, patients who had received subcutaneous protein C concentrate were identified from the literature, by contacting the manufacturers and by personal communication. Treatment details were available from 14 cases. Apart from one case where the infusion interval was inadvertently increased, no thrombotic events occurred even when doses were subsequently reduced. Initially, a trough protein C level of >025iu/ml should be aimed for. Subsequently, a smaller dose of subcutaneous protein C concentrate, especially if taken with an oral anticoagulant, may be protective maintenance treatment. The treatment was well tolerated with few side effects. Subcutaneous protein C concentrate on its own or combined with an oral anticoagulant appears to be safe and effective as maintenance treatment of severe protein C deficiency. A major advantage is the avoidance of central venous access devices. The incidence of neurodevelopmental handicap was high with blindness affecting the majority of patients.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate the anti-neurogenic function of the Gro/TLE1: Hes1 complex during cortical neurogenesis remain to be defined. Here we show that prolyl isomerase Pin1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1) and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) are expressed in cortical neural progenitor cells and form a complex that interacts with the Gro/TLE1: Hes1 complex. This association depends on the enzymatic activities of both HIPK2 and Pin1, as well as on the association of Gro/TLE1 with Hes1, but is independent of the previously described Hes1-activated phosphorylation of Gro/TLE1. Interaction with the Pin1: HIPK2 complex results in Gro/TLE1 hyperphosphorylation and weakens both the transcriptional repression activity and the anti-neurogenic function of the Gro/TLE1: Hes1 complex. These results provide evidence that HIPK2 and Pin1 work together to promote cortical neurogenesis, at least in part, by suppressing Gro/TLE1:Hes1-mediated inhibition of neuronal differentiation.

In animals and humans, the behavioral effects of adrenergic agents are presumed to involve neuromodulation of the prefrontal cortex, consistent with the demonstrated actions of dopaminergic agents. However, recent experimental work has shown that the ventral hippocampus (vHC) contributes to decision-making and impulse control, raising the possibility that the hippocampus may be an important site of action for these drugs. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of local vHC infusions of guanfacine and other neuropharmacological agents on behavioral decisions that involve a trade-off between reward size and delay. Different cohorts of rats were implanted with bilateral guide cannulae targeting the vHC. We examined the animals' behavior in a touchscreen version of a delay discounting task following intra-vHC infusions of: (a) guanfacine (alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptor agonist), (b) SCH 23390 (dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist), and (c) muscimol/baclofen (GABA(A/B) agonists). Guanfacine led to a dose-dependent reduction in impulsive decision-making, increasing the animals' tolerance for delay in exchange for a larger reward. By contrast, infusion of SCH 23390 had no behavioral effects. Consistent with previous lesion studies, reversible pharmacological inactivation with muscimol/baclofen increased impulsive decision-making. These data provide the first evidence that guanfacine, a commonly used treatment for ADHD, may derive its clinical benefits through hippocampal stimulation, via alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptors.

We further explore the phenotype associated with mutations in TUBB2B. Twenty patients with polymicrogyria (five unilateral) were tested for mutations in TUBB2B by Sanger sequencing. We identified two novel de novo mutations, c.743C>T (p.Ala248Val) and c.1139G>T (p.Arg380Leu) in exon 4 of TUBB2B in three unrelated families. Brain magnetic resonance images showed polymicrogyria involving predominantly the perisylvian regions. In addition, there was a dysmorphic appearance of the basal ganglia, thin corpus callosum, enlargement of the ventricles, thinning of the white matter and hypoplasia of pons and cerebellar vermis. This combination of associated features was absent in all 17 patients with polymicrogyria in whom no mutation was identified. This report underlines that the association of polymicrogyria with thin or absent corpus callosum, dysmorphic basal ganglia, brainstem and vermis hypoplasia is highly likely to result from mutations in TUBB2B and provides further insight in how mutations in TUBB2B affect protein function.

Louis			Nonlocal Regularization for Active Appearance Model: Application to Medial Temporal Lobe Segmentation	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						segmentation; appearance modeling; nonlocal means; label fusion; medial temporal lobe structures	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MULTI-ATLAS SEGMENTATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION; LABEL FUSION; MR-IMAGES; HIPPOCAMPUS SEGMENTATION; VOLUME MEASUREMENT; HUMAN BRAIN; AMYGDALA	The human medial temporal lobe (MTL) is an important part of the limbic system, and its substructures play key roles in learning, memory, and neurodegeneration. The MTL includes the hippocampus (HC), amygdala (AG), parahippocampal cortex (PHC), entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortexstructures that are complex in shape and have low between-structure intensity contrast, making them difficult to segment manually in magnetic resonance images. This article presents a new segmentation method that combines active appearance modeling and patch-based local refinement to automatically segment specific substructures of the MTL including HC, AG, PHC, and entorhinal/perirhinal cortex from MRI data. Appearance modeling, relying on eigend-ecomposition to analyze statistical variations in image intensity and shape information in study population, is used to capture global shape characteristics of each structure of interest with a generative model. Patch-based local refinement, using nonlocal means to compare the image local intensity properties, is applied to locally refine the segmentation results along the structure borders to improve structure delimitation. In this manner, nonlocal regularization and global shape constraints could allow more accurate segmentations of structures. Validation experiments against manually defined labels demonstrate that this new segmentation method is computationally efficient, robust, and accurate. In a leave-one-out validation on 54 normal young adults, the method yielded a mean Dice of 0.87 for the HC, 0.81 for the AG, 0.73 for the anterior parts of the parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal and perirhinal cortex), and 0.73 for the posterior parahippocampal gyrus.

This study longitudinally explores modifiable vascular risk factors for NPS in AD. MethodsParticipants enrolled in the Cache County Study on Memory in Aging with no dementia at baseline were subsequently assessed over three additional waves, and those with incident (new onset) dementia were invited to join the Dementia Progression Study for longitudinal follow-up. A total of 327 participants with incident AD were identified and assessed for the following vascular factors: atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, angina, coronary artery bypass surgery, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and use of antihypertensive or diabetes medicines. A vascular index (VI) was also calculated. NPS were assessed over time using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Affective and Psychotic symptom clusters were assessed separately. The association between vascular factors and change in NPI total score was analyzed using linear mixed model and in symptom clusters using a random effects model. ResultsNo individual vascular risk factors or the VI significantly predicted change in any individual NPS. The use of antihypertensive medications more than four times per week was associated with higher total NPI and Affective cluster scores. ConclusionsUse of antihypertensive medication was associated with higher total NPI and Affective cluster scores. The results of this study do not otherwise support vascular risk factors as modifiers of longitudinal change in NPS in AD. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Visual Acuity of Children Treated With Chemotherapy for Optic Pathway Gliomas	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						chemotherapy; optic pathway glioma; visual acuity	NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE-1; RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS; PEDIATRIC-ONCOLOGY; FOLLOW-UP; CARBOPLATIN; OUTCOMES; TUMORS; AGE	BackgroundChemotherapy is the most common primary treatment modality for pediatric optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). Due to the risk of severe visual impairment, visual acuity (VA) has become a clinical parameter of fundamental importance for children with OPGs. Despite this reality, most studies omit crucial information necessary for analysis of the effect of chemotherapy on VA in patients with cerebral gliomas. The principal goal of this study was to determine the immediate and long-term visual outcome of children treated first with chemotherapy for OPGs. ProcedureRetrospective, non-comparative, case series of children with OPGs treated initially with chemotherapy. VA was measured prior to chemotherapy, directly following chemotherapy, as well as at last follow-up. ResultsSeven children (14 eyes) were positive for the neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) mutation and 10 children (20 eyes) were without the NF1 mutation (sporadic). Three deaths, all in the sporadic cohort, occurred as a result of their OPG. Median follow-up time of survivors was 10.544.36 (SD) years. Both NF1 mutation positive and sporadic cohorts had deterioration in VA over time; however, deterioration was only statistically significant in the sporadic population. The percentage of eyes with vision weaker than 20/200 prior to chemotherapy, directly following chemotherapy and at last follow-up grew from 18% to 24% to 38%, respectively. ConclusionsIn both NF1 mutant and sporadic OPGs, VA deteriorated directly following chemotherapy as well as at long-term follow-up. Despite chemotherapy, eyes with severe functional impairment gradually increased over time. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014;61:223-227. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of our study was to systematically describe the most common sites of metastases in a contemporary cohort of PCa patients. METHODSPatients with metastatic PCa were abstracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1998-2010). Most common metastatic sites within the entire population were described. Stratification was performed according to the presence of single or multiple (2 sites) metastases. Additionally, we evaluated the distribution of metastatic sites amongst patients with and without bone metastases. RESULTSOverall, 74,826 patients with metastatic PCa were identified. The most common metastatic sites were bone (84%), distant lymph nodes (10.6%), liver (10.2%), and thorax (9.1%). Overall, 18.4% of patients had multiple metastatic sites involved. When stratifying patients according to the site of metastases, only 19.4% of men with bone metastases had multiple sites involved. Conversely, among patients with lymph nodes, liver, thorax, brain, digestive system, retroperitoneum, and kidney and adrenal gland metastases the proportion of men with multiple sites involved was 43.4%, 76.0%, 76.7%, 73.0%, 52.2%, 60.9%, and 76.4%, respectively. When focusing exclusively on patients with bone metastases, the most common sites of secondary metastases were liver (39.1%), thorax (35.2%), distant lymph nodes (24.6%), and brain (12.4%). CONCLUSIONSAlthough the majority of patients with metastatic PCa experience bone location, the proportion of patients with atypical metastases is not negligible. These findings might be helpful when planning diagnostic imaging procedures in patients with advanced PCa. Prostate 74:210-216, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

FORGE Canada Consortium	The utility of exome sequencing for genetic diagnosis in a familial microcephaly epilepsy syndrome	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Primary microcephaly; Epilepsy; Whole-exome sequencing; WDR62	WDR62; MUTATIONS; HETEROGENEITY; MCPH	Background: Despite remarkable advances in genetic testing, many adults with syndromic epilepsy remain without a molecular diagnosis. The challenge in providing genetic testing for this patient population lies in the extensive genetic heterogeneity associated with epilepsy. Even for the subset of epilepsy patients that present with a defining feature, such as microcephaly, the number of possible genes that would require interrogation by Sanger sequencing is extensive and often prohibitively expensive. Case presentation: We report a family of French Canadian descent with four adult children affected with severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and microcephaly born to consanguineous parents and evaluated by the Genetics Service to provide informed genetic counseling to unaffected family members regarding possible recurrence risks. We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) of DNA from one affected sibling as a first-line diagnostic tool and compared the prioritization of variants using two strategies: 1) focusing on genes with homozygous variants; and, 2) focusing on genes associated with microcephaly. Both approaches prioritized the same homozygous novel frameshift mutation (p.Arg608Serfs*26) in WDR62, a gene known to cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the homozygous mutation in the other three affected siblings. Conclusions: WES and subsequent filtering of the rare variants in a single affected family member led to the rapid and cost-effective identification of a novel homozygous frameshift mutation in WDR62, thereby explaining the severe neurodevelopmental disorder in this family and facilitating genetic counseling. Our findings support WES as an effective first-line diagnostic tool in families presenting with rare genetically heterogeneous neurological disorders.

DOPAMINERGIC ENHANCEMENT OF EXCITATORY SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION IN LAYER II ENTORHINAL NEURONS IS DEPENDENT ON D-1-LIKE RECEPTOR-MEDIATED SIGNALING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						entorhinal cortex; dopamine; PKA; protein; phosphatase 1	RAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; AMPA RECEPTOR; IN-VITRO; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL REGION; PRINCIPAL NEURONS; RHINAL CORTEX; D1 RECEPTORS; MODULATION	The modulatory neurotransmitter dopamine induces concentration-dependent changes in synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex, in which high concentrations of dopamine suppress evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and lower concentrations induce an acute synaptic facilitation. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were used to investigate the dopaminergic facilitation of synaptic responses in layer II neurons of the rat lateral entorhinal cortex. A constant bath application of 1 lM dopamine resulted in a consistent facilitation of EPSPs evoked in layer II fan cells by layer I stimulation; the size of the facilitation was more variable in pyramidal neurons, and synaptic responses in a small group of multiform neurons were not modulated by dopamine. Isolated inhibitory synaptic responses were not affected by dopamine, and the facilitation of EPSPs was not associated with a change in paired-pulse facilitation ratio. Voltage-clamp recordings of a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were facilitated by dopamine, but N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated currents were not. Bath application of the dopamine D1-like receptor blocker SCH23390 (50 lM), but not the D2-like receptor blocker sulpiride (50 lM), prevented the facilitation, indicating that it is dependent upon D1-like receptor activation. Dopamine D1 receptors lead to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), and including the PKA inhibitor H-89 or KT 5720 in the recording pipette solution prevented the facilitation of EPSCs. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of inhibitor 1 or the dopamine-and cAMP-regulated protein phosphatase (DARPP-32) can lead to a facilitation of AMPA receptor responses by inhibiting the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that reduces dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors, and we found here that inhibition of PP1 occluded the facilitatory effect of dopamine. The dopamine-induced facilitation of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic responses in layer II neurons of the lateral entorhinal cortex is therefore likely mediated via a D1 receptor-dependent increase in PKA activity and a resulting inhibition in PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors.

In the Neurospora VS ribozyme, metal cations play diverse roles; they are important for substrate recognition, formation of the active site, and shifting the pK(a)'s of two key nucleobases that contribute to the general acid-base mechanism. Recently, we determined the NMR structure of the A730 loop of the VS ribozyme active site (SLVI) that contributes the general acid (A(756)) in the enzymatic mechanism of the cleavage reaction. Our studies showed that magnesium (Mg2+) ions are essential to stabilize the formation of the S-turn motif within the A730 loop that exposes the A(756) nucleobase for catalysis. In this article, we extend these NMR investigations by precisely mapping the Mg2+-ion binding sites using manganese-induced paramagnetic relaxation enhancement and cadmium-induced chemical-shift perturbation of phosphorothioate RNAs. These experiments identify five Mg2+-ion binding sites within SLVI. Four Mg2+ ions in SLVI are associated with known RNA structural motifs, including the G-U wobble pair and the GNRA tetraloop, and our studies reveal novel insights about Mg2+ ion binding to these RNA motifs. Interestingly, one Mg2+ ion is specifically associated with the S-turn motif; confirming its structural role in the folding of the A730 loop. This Mg2+ ion is likely important for formation of the active site and may play an indirect role in catalysis.

Twenty-two scientifically novice participants (humanities and arts college students) were asked, in an fMR1 study, whether or not they thought the light bulbs in images presenting electric circuits were lighted up correctly, and if they were certain or uncertain of their answers. When participants reported that they were unsure of their responses, analyses revealed significant activations in brain areas typically involved in uncertainty (anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula cortex, and superior/dorsomedial frontal cortex) and in the left middle/superior temporal lobe. Certainty was associated with large bilateral activations in the occipital and parietal regions usually involved in visuospatial processing. Correct-and-certain answers were associated with activations that suggest a stronger mobilization of visual attention resources when compared to incorrect-and-certain answers. These findings provide insights into brainbased mechanisms of uncertainty that are activated when common misconceptions, identified as such by science education research literature, interfere in decision making in a school-like task. We also discuss the implications of these results from an educational perspective.

The LHTES system is integrated with a building mechanical ventilation system. Paraffin RT20 was used as a phase change material (PCM) and fins are used to enhance its performance. To reduce the computational time, artificial neural networks (ANN) was used to relate the relationships between the LHTES inputs and output parameters. Extensive CFD simulations were carried out to identify all the influential parameters for the development of ANN. They include phase change temperature range, air flow rate, the geometrical configuration of a LHTES system, fin size, and the unit's length. Further CFD simulations were carried out to provide sufficient data for proper training and testing of the ANN. The ANN model was used to predict the LHTES's outlet air-temperature. There was a good agreement between the ANN prediction and CFD model's prediction. The ANN model then was used to study the annual performance of a LHTES for application in Montreal. We found that the potential of use the centralized LHTES system to reduce the cooling load is high with a wider phase change temperature range. The centralized LHTES system contributes to reducing the cooling load from 21% to 36% when the length of the centralized LHTES system is increased from 500 to 650 mm at a flow rate of 1.5 m/s.

A large region of the cortex (10-20 mm diameter) is directly imaged with a CCD camera while the animal performs a behavioral task, producing spatio-temporal data with an unprecedented combination of spatial and temporal resolutions (respectively, tens of micrometers and milliseconds). However, researchers who have developed and used this technique have relied on heterogeneous software and methods to analyze their data. In this paper, we introduce Vobi One, a software package entirely dedicated to the processing of functional optical imaging data. It has been designed to facilitate the processing of data and the comparison of different analysis methods. Moreover, it should help bring good analysis practices to the community because it relies on a database and a standard format for data handling and it provides tools that allow producing reproducible research. Vobi One is an extension of the BrainVISA software platform, entirely written with the Python programming language, open source and freely available for download at https://trac.int.univ-amu.fr/vobLone.

Untangling the Influences of Voluntary Running, Environmental Complexity, Social Housing and Stress on Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHRONIC PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; DENTATE GRANULE CELLS; ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT; ENRICHED ENVIRONMENT; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; OLD-AGE; GYRUS; PROLIFERATION; BRAIN	Environmental enrichment (EE) exerts powerful effects on brain physiology, and is widely used as an experimental and therapeutic tool. Typical EE paradigms are multifactorial, incorporating elements of physical exercise, environmental complexity, social interactions and stress, however the specific contributions of these variables have not been separable using conventional housing paradigms. Here, we evaluated the impacts of these individual variables on adult hippocampal neurogenesis by using a novel "Alternating EE" paradigm. For 4 weeks, adult male CD1 mice were alternated daily between two enriched environments; by comparing groups that differed in one of their two environments, the individual and combinatorial effects of EE variables could be resolved. The Alternating EE paradigm revealed that (1) voluntary running for 3 days/week was sufficient to increase both mitotic and post-mitotic stages of hippocampal neurogenesis, confirming the central importance of exercise; (2) a complex environment (comprised of both social interactions and rotated inanimate objects) had no effect on neurogenesis itself, but enhanced depolarization-induced c-Fos expression (attributable to social interactions) and buffered stress-induced plasma corticosterone levels (attributable to inanimate objects); and (3) neither social isolation, group housing, nor chronically increased levels of plasma corticosterone had a prolonged impact on neurogenesis. Mouse strain, handling and type of running apparatus were tested and excluded as potential confounding factors. These findings provide valuable insights into the relative effects of key EE variables on adult neurogenesis, and this "Alternating EE" paradigm represents a useful tool for exploring the contributions of individual EE variables to mechanisms of neural plasticity.

Although morphological properties of microglia have been described in rodents, little is known about their fine features in humans. The aim of this study was to characterize the morphometric properties of human microglia in gray and white matter of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), a region implicated in behavioral adaptation to neuroinflammation. These properties were compared to those of murine microglia in order to gain a better appreciation of the differences displayed by these cells across species. Methods: Postmortem dACC samples were analyzed from 11 individuals having died suddenly without any history of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, nor psychiatric illness. Tissues were sectioned and immunostained for the macrophage marker Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1). Randomly selected IBA1-immunoreactive (IBA1-IR) cells displaying features corresponding to commonly accepted microglial phenotypes (ramified, primed, reactive, amoeboid) were reconstructed in 3D and all aspects of their morphologies quantified using the Neurolucida software. The relative abundance of each morphological phenotype was also assessed. Furthermore, adult mouse brains were similarly immunostained, and IBA1-IR cells in cingulate cortex were compared to those scrutinized in human dACC. Results: In human cortical gray and white matter, all microglial phenotypes were observed in significant proportions. Compared to ramified, primed microglia presented an average 2.5 fold increase in cell body size, with almost no differences in branching patterns. When compared to the primed microglia, which projected an average of six primary processes, the reactive and amoeboid phenotypes displayed fewer processes and branching points, or no processes at all. In contrast, the majority of microglial cells in adult mouse cortex were highly ramified. This was also the case following a postmortem interval of 43 hours. Interestingly, the morphology of ramified microglia was strikingly similar between species. Conclusions: This study provides fundamental information on the morphological features of microglia in the normal adult human cerebral cortex. These morphometric data will be useful for future studies of microglial morphology in various illnesses. Furthermore, this first direct comparison of human and mouse microglia reveals that these brain cells are morphologically similar across species, suggesting highly conserved functions.

Complex tasks that require high temporal and spatial precision of multisensory integration put strong demands on the underlying networks but it is largely unknown how task experience shapes multisensory processing. Long-term musical training is an excellent model for brain plasticity because it shapes the human brain at functional and structural levels, affecting a network of brain areas. In the present study we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate how audio-tactile perception is integrated in the human brain and if musicians show enhancement of the corresponding activation compared to non-musicians. Using a paradigm that allowed the investigation of combined and separate auditory and tactile processing, we found a multisensory incongruency response, generated in frontal, cingulate and cerebellar regions, an auditory mismatch response generated mainly in the auditory cortex and a tactile mismatch response generated in frontal and cerebellar regions. The influence of musical training was seen in the audio-tactile as well as in the auditory condition, indicating enhanced higher-order processing in musicians, while the sources of the tactile MMN were not influenced by long-term musical training. Consistent with the predictive coding model, more basic, bottom-up sensory processing was relatively stable and less affected by expertise, whereas areas for top-down models of multisensory expectancies were modulated by training.

This study aimed to evaluate glaucoma-like features in the rat episcleral vein cauterization (EVC) model by multiple in vivo and in vitro evidences. Methods Wistar rat was used in this study. The elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) was induced by cauterization of three episcleral veins. IOP was monitored with Tono-Pen XL tonometer. Time-dependent changes to the neuronal retinal layers were quantified by Fourier domain-optical coherence tomography. The function of retina was evaluated by electroretinogram (ERG). Survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was quantified by retrograde labeling. Histology study was performed with retinal sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neuronal nuclear antigen. Retina and aqueous humor protein were extracted and cytotoxic protein tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and alpha-2 macroglobulin (alpha 2m) were measured with Western blotting. Results EVC is a relatively facile intervention, with low failure rates (<5%). After surgical intervention, chronic mild IOP elevation (about 1.6-fold over normal, P <0.05) was induced for at least 6 weeks without requiring a second intervention. High IOP causes chronic and progressive loss of RGCs (averaging about 4% per week), progressive thinning of neuronal retinal layers (3-5 mu m per week), and reduction of a- and b-wave in ERG. EVC method can also induce glial cell activation and alterations of inflammation proteins, such as TNF-alpha and alpha 2m. Conclusion EVC method can establish a robust, reliable, economic and highly reproducible glaucomatous animal model.

Application to eloquent motor cortex mapping	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						spatial components; ICA; SVD; components selection; mutual information; eloquent cortex mapping	TIME-SERIES; RECORDINGS	Spatial component analysis is often used to explore multidimensional time series data whose sources cannot be measured directly. Several methods may be used to decompose the data into a set of spatial components with temporal loadings. Component selection is of crucial importance, and should be supported by objective criteria. In some applications, the use of a well defined component selection criterion may provide for automation of the analysis. In this paper we describe a novel approach for ranking of spatial components calculated from the EEG or MEG data recorded within evoked response paradigm. Our method is called Mutual Information (MI) Spectrum and is based on gauging the amount of MI of spatial component temporal loadings with a synthetically created reference signal. We also describe the appropriate randomization based statistical assessment scheme that can be used for selection of components with statistically significant amount of MI. Using simulated data with realistic trial to trial variations and SNR corresponding to the real recordings we demonstrate the superior performance characteristics of the described MI based measure as compared to a more conventionally used power driven gauge. We also demonstrate the application of the MI Spectrum for the selection of task-related independent components from real MEG data. We show that the MI spectrum allows to identify task-related components reliably in a consistent fashion, yielding stable results even from a small number of trials.

Here, we examined the expression and role of the B-type Eph receptor EphB2 in breast cancers. By immunohistochemistry using a progression tissue microarray of human clinical samples, we found EphB2 to be expressed in benign tissues, but strongly increased in cancers particularly in invasive and metastatic carcinomas. Subsequently, we found evidence that EphB2, whose expression varies in established cell breast lines, possesses multiple functions. First, the use of a DOX-inducible system to restore EphB2 function to low expressers resulted in decreased tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, while its siRNA-mediated silencing in high expressers increased growth. This function involves the onset of apoptotic death paralleled by caspases 3 and 9 activation. Second, EphB2 was also found to induce autophagy, as assessed by immunofluorescence and/or immunoblotting examination of the LC3, ATG5 and ATG12 markers. Third, EphB2 also has a pro-invasive function in breast cancer cells that involves the regulation of MMP2 and MMP9 metalloproteases and can be blocked by treatment with respective neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, EphB2-induced invasion is kinase-dependent and is impeded in cells expressing a kinase-dead mutant EphB2. In summary, we identified a mechanism involving a triple role for EphB2 in breast cancer progression, whereby it regulates apoptosis, autophagy, and invasion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The outcome of its activation ranges from stimulation of cell survival and proliferation to triggering tumor suppressor responses such as cell differentiation, cell senescence, and apoptosis. This pathway is intimately linked to cancer as several of its upstream activators are frequently mutated in human disease and are shown to accelerate tumorigenesis when engineered in the mouse genome. However, measurement of activated ERKs in human cancers or mouse models does not always support a role in tumorigenesis, and data consistent with a role in tumor suppression have been reported as well. The intensity of ERK signaling, negative feedback loops that regulate the pathway, and cross-talks with other signaling pathways, seem to be of primary importance in determining the final cellular outcome. Cell senescence, a putative tumor-suppression mechanism, depends on high-intensity ERK signals that trigger phosphorylation-dependent protein degradation of multiple proteins required for cell-cycle progression. This response may be circumvented during carcinogenesis by a variety of mechanisms, some of them yet to be discovered, which in essence turn ERK functions from tumor suppression to tumor promotion. The use of pharmacologic inhibitors targeting this pathway must be carefully evaluated so they are applied to cases in which ERKs are mainly oncogenic. (C) 2014 AACR.

Part 1: Theory and proposed methodology	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Sleep spindle; Time delay; Time-frequency analysis; Signal propagation; S-transform	S-TRANSFORM; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; SLOW OSCILLATION; BRAIN; COHERENCE; LOCALIZATION; FORMULATION; RECORDINGS; LAPLACIAN; SPECTRUM	Background: A convergence of studies has revealed sleep spindles to be associated with sleep-related cognitive processing and even with fundamental waking state capacities such as intelligence. However, some spindle characteristics, such as propagation direction and delay, may play a decisive role but are only infrequently investigated because of technical complexities. New method: A new methodology for assessing sleep spindle propagation over the human scalp using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is described. This approach is based on the alignment of time-frequency representations of spindle activity across recording channels. Results: This first of a two-part series concentrates on framing theoretical considerations related to EEG spindle propagation and on detailing the methodology. A short example application is provided that illustrates the repeatability of results obtained with the new propagation measure in a sample of 32 night recordings. A more comprehensive experimental investigation is presented in part two of the series. Comparison with existing method(s): Compared to existing methods, this approach is particularly well adapted for studying the propagation of sleep spindles because it estimates time delays rather than phase synchrony and it computes propagation properties for every individual spindle with windows adjusted to the specific spindle duration. Conclusions: The proposed methodology is effective in tracking the propagation of spindles across the scalp and may thus help in elucidating the temporal aspects of sleep spindle dynamics, as well as other transient EEG and MEG events. A software implementation (the Spyndle Python package) is provided as open source software. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Whereas the first part describes the methodology in detail, this part proposes a thorough evaluation of the approach by applying it to a sample of laboratory sleep recordings. New method: The tested methodology is based on the alignment of time frequency representations of spindle activity across recording channels and is used for assessing sleep spindle propagation over the human scalp using noninvasive EEG. Results: Spindle propagation displays features that suggest wave displacements of global synaptic potential fields. Propagation patterns that are coherent (as opposed to random), laterally symmetrical, and highly repeatable within and between subjects were observed. Propagation was slower from posterior to anterior and from central to lateral brain regions than in the opposite directions. Propagation speeds varying between 2.3 and 7.0 m/s were obtained. A distinct grouping of propagation properties was noted for a small cluster of frontal electrodes. No propagation between distantly separated scalp locations was observed. The values of spindle characteristics such as average frequency, RMS amplitude, frequency slope, and duration, depend largely on propagation direction but are only mildly correlated with propagation delay. Comparison with existing method(s): Results obtained are in line with many results published in the literature and offer new measures for describing sleep spindle behavior. Conclusions: Propagation properties provide new information about sleep spindle behavior and thus allow more precise automated assessments of spindle-related functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Near-infrared spectroscopy versus magnetic resonance imaging to study brain perfusion in newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated with hypothermia	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Brain; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; Magnetic resonance imaging; Newborn; Near-infrared spectroscopy; Perfusion	AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL TISSUE OXYGENATION; BLOOD-FLOW VELOCITY; NEONATAL ENCEPHALOPATHY; TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER; ASPHYXIATED NEWBORNS; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; PERINATAL ASPHYXIA; PRETERM INFANTS; INTENSIVE-CARE	Background: The measurement of brain perfusion may provide valuable information for assessment and treatment of newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). While arterial spin labeled perfusion (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides noninvasive and direct measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) values, it is logistically challenging to obtain. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) might be an alternative, as it permits noninvasive and continuous monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation at the bedside. Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine the correlation between measurements of brain perfusion by NIRS and by Mitt in term newborns with HIE treated with hypothermia. Design/methods: In this prospective cohort study, ASL-MRI and NIRS performed during hypothermia were used to assess brain perfusion in these newborns. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) values, measured from 1-2 MRI scans for each patient, were compared to mixed venous saturation values (SctO(2)) recorded by NIBS just before and after each MRI. Analysis included groupings into moderate versus severe HIE based on their initial background pattern of amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram. Results: Twelve concomitant recordings were obtained of seven neonates. Strong correlation was found between SctO(2) and CBF in asphyxiated newborns with severe HIE (r = 0.88; p value = 0.0085). Moreover, newborns with severe HIE had lower CBF (likely lower oxygen supply) and extracted less oxygen (likely lower oxygen demand or utilization) when comparing SctO(2) and CBF to those with moderate HIE. Conclusions: NIBS is an effective bedside tool to monitor and understand brain perfusion changes in term asphyxiated newborns, which in conjunction with precise measurements of CBF obtained by MRI at particular times, may help tailor neuroprotective strategies in term newborns with HIE.

From mutagenesis studies, it has been established that this I/V kissing-loop interaction involves three Watson-Crick base pairs and is associated with a structural rearrangement of the SLI substrate that facilitates catalysis. Here, we report the NMR. structural characterization of this I/V kissing-loop using isolated stem-loops. NMR studies were performed on different SLI/SLV complexes containing a common SLV and shiftable, preshifted, or double-stranded SLI variants. These studies confirm the presence of three Watson-Crick base pairs at the kissing-loop junction and provide evidence for the structural rearrangement of shiftable SLI variants upon SLV binding. NMR structure determination of an SLI/SLV complex demonstrates that both the SLI and SLV loops adopt U-turn structures, which facilitates intermolecular Watson-Crick base pairing. Several other interactions at the I/V interface, including base triples and base stacking, help create a continuously stacked structure. These NMR studies provide a structural basis to understand the stability of the I/V kissing-loop interaction and lead us to propose a kinetic model for substrate activation in the VS ribozyme.

During the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic increased use of antiviral treatment of hospital patients was reported. We have carried out prospective surveillance for influenza in patients in a large network of Canadian hospitals since 2006. We wished to assess trends in antiviral use in the two seasons (2010-2011 and 2011-2012) since the end of the pandemic. Findings: Adults (>16 years) testing positive for influenza at the time of or during admission to participating Canadian hospitals were prospectively reviewed. In 2009-2010 there were 1132 confirmed cases, 1107 in 2010-2011 and 631 in 2011-2012. Information on antiviral therapy was available in >95% in each year. Rising to 89.6% in 2009, the proportion of adult patients treated with antiviral therapy fell to 79.9% and 65.7% in the two subsequent seasons (p < 0.001). Oseltamivir was the antiviral agent used in >98% of cases in each year. The median time from onset of symptoms to initiation of antiviral therapy was three days. The treatment proportion fell across all age groups, co-morbid conditions and disease severity. Conclusion: Despite evidence for benefit of antiviral therapy, and clinical practice guidelines recommending treatment of this population, antiviral therapy of Canadian adults hospitalized with influenza has progressively fallen in the two seasons since the end of the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic.

Action-based effects on music perception	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						embodied music cognition; common coding theory; sensory-motor association learning; dynamical systems; internal model	SPATIOTEMPORAL MOTION TEMPLATES; SELF-INITIATED SOUNDS; SENSORY ATTENUATION; RHYTHM PERCEPTION; ACTION REPRESENTATION; PERFORMING MUSICIANS; EFFECT ANTICIPATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; EMBODIED COGNITION; BRAIN PLASTICITY	The classical, disembodied approach to music cognition conceptualizes action and perception as separate, peripheral processes. In contrast, embodied accounts of music cognition emphasize the central role of the close coupling of action and perception. It is a commonly established fact that perception spurs action tendencies. We present a theoretical framework that captures the ways in which the human motor system and its actions can reciprocally influence the perception of music. The cornerstone of this framework is the common coding theory, postulating a representational overlap in the brain between the planning, the execution, and the perception of movement. The integration of action and perception in so-called internal models is explained as a result of associative learning processes. Characteristic of internal models is that they allow intended or perceived sensory states to be transferred into corresponding motor commands (inverse modeling), and vice versa, to predict the sensory outcomes of planned actions (forward modeling). Embodied accounts typically refer to inverse modeling to explain action effects on music perception (Leman, 2007). We extend this account by pinpointing forward modeling as an alternative mechanism by which action can modulate perception. We provide an extensive overview of recent empirical evidence in support of this idea. Additionally, we demonstrate that motor dysfunctions can cause perceptual disabilities, supporting the main idea of the paper that the human motor system plays a functional role in auditory perception. The finding that music perception is shaped by the human motor system and its actions suggests that the musical mind is highly embodied. However, we advocate for a more radical approach to embodied (music) cognition in the sense that it needs to be considered as a dynamical process, in which aspects of action, perception, introspection, and social interaction are of crucial importance.

NEUROSTEROIDS MODULATE EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY AND ASSOCIATED HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS IN THE PIRIFORM CORTEX	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						4-aminopyridine; THDOC; epileptiform synchronization; high-frequency oscillations; ictogenesis	FAST RIPPLES; IN-VITRO; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; OLFACTORY CORTEX; LIMBIC SYSTEM; DELTA-SUBUNIT; MECHANISMS; HIPPOCAMPUS; RAT; 4-AMINOPYRIDINE	Allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) belongs to a class of pregnane neurosteroidal compounds that enhance brain inhibition by interacting directly with GABA(A) signaling, mainly through an increase in tonic inhibitory current. Here, we addressed the role of THDOC in the modulation of interictal- and ictal-like activity and associated high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500 Hz; ripples: 80-200 Hz, fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) recorded in vitro in the rat piriform cortex, a highly excitable brain structure that is implicated in seizure generation and maintenance. We found that THDOC: (i) increased the duration of interictal discharges in the anterior piriform cortex while decreasing ictal discharge duration in both anterior and posterior piri-form cortices; (ii) reduced the occurrence of HFOs associated to both interictal and ictal discharges; and (iii) prolonged the duration of 4-aminopyridine-induced, glutamatergic independent synchronous field potentials that are known to mainly result from the activation of GABA(A) receptors. Our results indicate that THDOC can modulate epileptiform synchronization in the piriform cortex presumably by potentiating GABA(A) receptor-mediated signaling. This evidence supports the view that neurosteroids regulate neuronal excitability and thus control the occurrence of seizures. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of IBRO.

Infants at familial risk and low risk of developing ASD were tested longitudinally between the ages of 7 and 36 months. Data were analysed from motor scales on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales at each age point. Significantly lower motor scores in at-risk infants were evident from the age of 7 months compared to the low-risk group. Infants who were later diagnosed with ASD demonstrated significantly poorer Fine Motor skills at 36 months than at-risk infants without any developmental difficulties. In addition, Gross Motor scores were highly correlated across the two measures for low-risk infants and infants who later developed ASD. Early motor difficulties may be an early indicator of a number of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD.

The work focuses on using the VMD lowest mode or the EMD residue for denoising images corrupted with Gaussian noise, as opposed to DWT decomposition with thresholding. The comparison is made on a data set composed of a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI), a prostate tissue image, and a retina digital image. Based on peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the results show that the VMD and EMD approaches outperform the conventional DWT-based thresholding approach, and that the VMD performed best overall. It is concluded that biomedical image denoising based on the VMD lowest mode or the EMD residue is a promising approach in comparison to DWT thresholding.

Electrodes were fabricated using micromachining techniques. Geometrical features of these electrodes provide more contacts between the electrodes and targeted neural tissues. In order to achieve the proposed geometry, we introduce a novel masking method to coat variable-height electrodes with uniform and small tip-exposure that significantly improves process time and costs compared to conventional techniques. In the next step, the active sites of the electrodes were coated with thin-films of molybdenum (Mo) and platinum (Pt). The average impedance of Mo and Pt electrodes at 1 kHz was 350 +/- 50 k Omega and 150 +/- 10 k Omega, respectively.

We have developed a technique, which combines psychophysical and neuroimaging procedures to examine plasticity in the resting-brain following perceptual learning in a somatosensory-discrimination task. We show that effects of perceptual learning are not local to sensory areas of the brain, but rather change functional connectivity (FC) between somatosensory and motor areas and notably between primary motor and premotor areas of the brain. In behavioral terms, somatosensory perceptual training improves the rate and extent of motor learning. The beneficial effects are substantially dependent upon cognitive involvement and skill acquisition in the sensory domain. Passive-movement training without perceptual learning is less able to induce plasticity in the motor system. Overall, this study suggests a distributed pattern of plasticity due to perceptual learning that spreads beyond traditional boundaries of the somatosensory system.

Methods: A cohort study was conducted in Quebec (Canada). Patients reporting chronic noncancer pain with an average pain intensity of at least 4 on a 0-10 scale (10= worst possible pain) and having an active analgesic prescription from a primary-care physician were recruited. They completed a telephone interview and a self-administered questionnaire to document their pain, emotional well-being, satisfaction with treatment, and barriers/beliefs/attitudes about pain and its treatment. Information on pharmacotherapy was based on an administrative provincial database and pharmacies' charts. Determinants of patients' satisfaction were identified using multivariate linear regression models. Results: Four hundred and eighty six patients participated. Their mean age was 58.4 years and they had had pain for a mean of 11.7 years (standard deviation, +/- 11.1) at an average pain intensity of 6.5 in the past week. Although 90% reported adverse gastrointestinal effects, 36.4% and 54.4% of these patients took no over-the-counter or prescribed medication for constipation or nausea, respectively. On a scale from 0-100, the mean overall satisfaction score was 64.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 63.5-65.9). Patient satisfaction was low, particularly regarding the "information about pain and its treatment" (mean 50.6; 95% CI = 47.6-53.7) and "treatment efficacy" (mean 53.6; 95% CI = 51.5-55.6) subscales. The overall treatment satisfaction score decreased with more pain disability, probable depression and anxiety, more barriers to pain treatment, higher incidence of nausea, and use of over-the-counter analgesics. Conclusion: In primary care, patients' level of satisfaction with their pain treatment is not optimal. This study underlines how the expanded scope of practice of community pharmacists may allow them to play a pivotal role in providing information, discussing barriers to pain treatment, and monitoring pain disability, and by appropriately managing pharmacotherapy to optimize effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects.

Purpose: To evaluate the annual direct health care costs and productivity costs associated with moderate to severe CNCP in primary care patients taking into account their pain disability. Materials and methods: Patients reporting noncancer pain for at least 6 months, at a pain intensity of 4 or more on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) intensity scale, and at a frequency of at least 2 days a week, were recruited from community pharmacies. Patients' characteristics, health care utilization, and productivity losses (absenteeism and presenteeism) were documented using administrative databases, pharmacies' renewal charts, telephone, and self-administered questionnaires. Patients were stratified by tertile of pain disability measured by the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire. Results: Patients (number = 483) were, on average, 59 years old, mainly women (67.5%), and suffered from CNCP for a mean of 12 years at an average pain intensity of 6.5 +/- 1.9. The annual direct health care costs and productivity costs averaged CAD $9,565 (+/-$13,993) and CAD $7,072 (+/-$11,716), respectively. The use of complementary health care services accounted for almost 50% of the direct health care costs. The mean adjusted total direct health care costs (considering pain-related hospitalizations only) and productivity costs increased with more pain disability: low disability, CAD $12,118; moderate, CAD $18,278; and severe, CAD $19,216; P=0.001. Conclusion: The economic burden of CNCP is substantial and increases with the level of pain disability, which suggests the need for and potential benefits of improving CNCP management through specific and adapted treatment plans targeting the impact of pain on daily functioning.

First, the MRI is preprocessed to emphasize edges. Then, the result is split into right and left brain hemisphere components that are converted to one-dimensional signals, for which the Hurst's exponent, the scaling exponent of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and the energy of DFA fluctuations are computed to form a six-component feature vector. Finally, the vector is classified by a support vector machine (SVM). Using ten-fold cross validation and a set of twenty eight normal and twenty eight MR images of patients affected by AVMs, the classification of the corresponding feature vectors by the SVM achieved an accuracy of 98.26%, with a sensitivity of 98.82% and a specificity of 97.69%.

An initial Bayesian tumour classification based on Gabor texture features permits subsequent computations to be focused on areas where the probability of tumour is deemed high. An iterative, multistage Markov Random Field (MRF) framework is then devised to classify the various tumour subclasses (e.g. edema, solid tumour, enhancing tumour and necrotic core). Specifically, an adapted, voxel-based MRF provides tumour candidates to a higher level, regional MRF, which then leverages both contextual texture information and relative spatial consistency of the tumour subclass positions to provide updated regional information down to the voxel-based MRF for further local refinement. The two stages iterate until convergence. Experiments are performed on publicly available, patient brain tumour images from the MICCAI 2012 [ 11] and 2013 [ 12] Brain Tumour Segmentation Challenges. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the top performance in the segmentation of tumour cores and enhancing tumours, and performs comparably to the winners in other tumour categories.

Recently, Gripon and Berrou have introduced a novel construction which builds on ideas from the theory of error correcting codes, greatly outperforming the celebrated Hopfield Neural Networks in terms of the number of stored messages per neuron and the number of stored bits per synapse. The work of Gripon and Berrou proposes two retrieval rules, SUM-OF-SUM and SUM-OF-MAX. In this paper, we implement both rules on a general purpose graphical processing unit (GPU). SUM-OF-SUM uses only matrix-vector multiplication and is easily implemented on the GPU, whereas SUM-OF-MAX, which involves non-linear operations, is much less straightforward to fulfill. However, SUM-OF-MAX gives significantly better retrieval error rates. We propose a hybrid scheme tailored for implementation on a GPU which achieves a 880-fold speedup without sacrificing any accuracy.

For this purpose, a flexible structure is equipped with acceleration transducers at each degree of freedom and a force transducer for validation and training. The models are trained using data obtained from applying a random excitation force on the flexible structure. The performance of the developed models is evaluated by analyzing the prediction capabilities based on a normalized prediction error. The frequency domain is considered to analyze the similarity of the frequencies in the predicted and the original force signal. For a selection of the best models, a more advanced performance analysis is carried out. This includes application of the trained models to deterministic and non-deterministic excitation forces with different excitation frequencies and amplitudes. Additionally, the influence of the sampling frequency and sensor location on the model performance is investigated. The results obtained in this paper show that most data mining approaches can be used, when a certain degree of inaccuracy is accepted. Furthermore, the comparison study points out that the transducer location is crucial for the model performance. However, there exists no general solution for the final selection of models.

Controlling the deployment of virtual machines on clusters and clouds for scientific computing in CBRAIN	2014 14TH IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CLUSTER, CLOUD AND GRID COMPUTING (CCGRID)	IEEE-ACM International Symposium on Cluster Cloud and Grid Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid)	MAY 26-29, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE, Assoc Comp Machinery, IEEE Comp Soc, U S Natl Sci Fdn, IEEE Tech Comm Scalable Comp				The emergence of hardware virtualization, notably exploited by cloud infrastructures, led to a paradigm shift in distributed computing by enabling complete software customization and elastic scaling of resources. However, new software architectures and deployment algorithms are still required to fully exploit virtualization in web platforms used for scientific computing, commonly called science gateways. We propose a software architecture and an algorithm to enable and optimize the deployment of virtual machines on clusters and clouds in science gateways. Our architecture is based on 3 design principles: (i) separation between resource provisioning and task scheduling (ii) encapsulation of VMs in regular computing tasks (iii) association of a virtual computing site to each disk image. Our algorithm submits and removes VMs on clusters and clouds based on the current system workload, the number of available job slots in active VMs, the cost and current performance of clouds clusters, and a parameter quantifying the performancecost trade-off. To cope with variable queuing and booting times, it replicates VMs on independent computing sites selected from a minimization of a makespan-cost linear combination in the Pareto set of non-dominated solutions. Makespan and cost are estimated from the last measured queuing, booting, and task execution times, using an exponential model of the gain yielded by VM replication. We implement this algorithm in CBRAIN, a science gateway widely used for neuroimaging, and we evaluate it on an infrastructure of 2 clusters and 1 cloud. Results show that it is able to reach some points of the performance-cost trade-off associated to VM deployment.

Recently, neuroimaging studies using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging have revealed that certain neural structures are highly active during periods of rest. Amongst several methods that have been developed to analyze resting-state fMRI data, Probabilistic Independent Component Analysis (PICA) is currently the most popular technique. The major challenge of using PICA is that resting-state networks are split into several components and visually extracting them can be difficult. In this paper, we propose a fast and precise algorithm based on advanced template matching in spatial domain such as Normalized Cross Correlation adapted to functional images in order to automatically extract the Default Mode Network (DMN) which is the task independent resting state network in the brain using PICA. We create a DMN template covering all reported regions in literature using two standard atlases. Ultimately, we reconstruct an image of the extracted DMN from PICA using an optimized decision making. Our approach was effective given that our algorithm results correlated highly with the DMN template.

Sparse Clustered Networks (SCNs) are recently-introduced binary-weighted associative memories that significantly improve the storage and retrieval capabilities over the prior state-of-the art. However, deleting or updating the data patterns result in a significant increase in the data retrieval error probability. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to address this problem by incorporating multiple-valued weights for the interconnections used in the network. The proposed algorithm lowers the error rate by an order of magnitude for our sample network with 60% deleted contents. We then investigate the advantages of the proposed algorithm for hardware implementations.

To address this challenging problem, several biomarkers based on MRI have been proposed. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to improve MRI-based feature quality or to increase machine learning methods accuracy, the current AD prognosis accuracy remains limited. In this paper, we propose to combine both high quality biomarkers and advanced learning method. Our approach is based on a robust ensemble learning strategy using gray matter grading. The estimated weak classifiers are then fused into high informative anatomical sub-ensembles. Through a sparse logistic regression, the most relevant anatomical sub-ensembles are selected, weighted and used as input to a global classifier. Validation on the full ADNI1 dataset demonstrates that the proposed method obtains competitive results of prediction of conversion to AD in the Mild Cognitive Impairment group with an accuracy of 75.6%.

However, standard gadolinium models used clinically are often incomplete due to the extent of manual labor required to segment the vessels and because gadolinium contrast decreases rapidly with vessel size. In this work, we propose an automatic method, based on the Markov Random Field (MRF) theory, to segment venous blood vessels from dense susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) venography datasets. Unlike conventional isotropic auto-logistic MRF, our MRF design anisotropically favors the neighboring influence of voxels classified as "vessels" to better preserve thin vessels imaged by SWI. Results show that MRF segmentation of deep veins compares well with standard scale-space vesselness analysis. Most importantly, we demonstrate automatic segmentation of superficial veins on SWI and creation of denser 3D vascular models that may improve clinical gadolinium-based models.

To record intracranial EEG in some patients with intractable epilepsy, depth electrodes are implanted through holes in the skull. The proposed fully automatic procedure maximizes recording coverage of the target volume by estimating the EEG recorded from each contact, while minimizing the risk of approaching vessels and other critical structures. All structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala were automatically segmented. We retrospectively validated the procedure for mesial temporal lobe implantations in 11 hemispheres. The automatic trajectories recorded from a larger volume of interest than the original manually selected trajectories while better avoiding the segmented structures. The procedure is integrated into a neuronavigation system enabling the surgeon to visualize the selected trajectories from an ordered list and, if necessary, enables re-planning a trajectory in near real time.

Reorganising the chained system into two subsystem, combine a exponential decaying term to deal with the uncontrollable which carry by the vanishing of u(1). After state scaling transformation, a model predictive control (MPC) method is developed for the chained systems. The MPC method iteratively solve a formulated quadratic programming (QP) problem by using a recurrent neural network(RNN) called general projection network(GPN) over a finite receding horizon to get the input vector for the system control.

SNNs are composed of neurons and synapses which are interconnected with a complex pattern. As communication in such massively parallel computational systems is getting critical, the network-on-chip (NoC) becomes a promising solution to provide a scalable and robust interconnection fabric. However, using NoC for large-scale SNNs arises a trade-off between scalability, throughput, neuron/router ratio (cluster size), and area overhead. In this paper, we tackle the trade-off using a clustering approach and try to optimize the synaptic resource utilization. An optimal cluster size can provide the lowest area overhead and power consumption. For the learning purposes, a phenomenon known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is utilized. The micro-architectures of the network, clusters, and the computational neurons are also described. The presented approach suggests a promising solution of integrating NoCs and STDP-based SNNs for the optimal performance based on the underlying application.

Our approach relies on a local similarity metric based on gradient orientation alignment and distance to the nearest inferred boundary and is evaluated on a reduced set of locations corresponding to inferred boundaries. The deformation model is characterized as the integration of a time-constant velocity field and optimization is performed in coarse to fine multi-level strategy with a gradient ascent technique. Our approach is computational efficient since it relies on a sparse selection of voxels corresponding to detected boundaries, yielding robust and accurate results with reduced processing times. We demonstrate quantitative results in the context of the non-linear registration of inter-patient magnetic resonance brain volumes obtained from a public dataset (CUMC12). Our proposed approach achieves a similar level of accuracy as other state-of-the-art methods but with processing times as short as 1.5 minutes. We also demonstrate preliminary qualitative results in the time-sensitive registration contexts of registering MR brain volumes to intra-operative ultrasound for improved guidance in neurosurgery.

Advancing the science of organ donor management	CRITICAL CARE			English	Editorial Material							POTENTIAL HEART; THERAPY; CORTICOSTEROIDS; RESUSCITATION	There is an increasing burden of responsibility for intensivists to optimize donation potential after the declaration of brain death in patients with catastrophic brain injury. Best practice for donor management, if present, has been formed on low quality and mainly observational studies or consensus. In particular, research into the use of corticosteroids has shown varied benefit. The specific and limited results of the CORTICOME study are less important than the systematic methodology and the development of rigour in the study of deceased organ donation. Donor management would benefit from continued systematic analysis of current literature, understanding of the physiologic basis for therapy, and further prospective controlled trials. Worldwide collaboration partnerships and funding are needed to optimize the management of deceased organ donation.

While the primary objective is to provide user-interface for disabled people for artistic expression, special emphasis is given to the design of graphical user interface where bio-signals are the predominant input sources. Among three unique solution methodologies are investigated (Electromyography (EMG), Electrooculography (EOG) and Electroencephalography (EEG)), stimulation based human-computer interaction method (EEG feature extraction method) is found to be the most promising towards achieving design environments for performing complex tasks. Stimulation signals are used to replicate the multi-level ribbon style menu options which is typical format used in today's software interfaces. Users communicate with the computer by simply responding to appropriate stimulation signal through generating response signals. We propose an EEG feature extraction method based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) to match the stimulating signals with the response signals. Successful pairing of stimulation signals with the brain's response enables users of such system to perform various actions including artistic expression in 3D.

The task of designing mechatronic systems is understood to be very tedious and complex because of the high number of components, the multi-physics aspects, the couplings between the different domains involved and the interacting design criteria. Due to this inherent complexity, a systematic and multi-objective approach is needed to replace the traditional methods used to support the design activity and design performance evaluation. In this paper we present a Choquet integral-based neural network alongside with a new multi-criteria profile for mechatronic system performance evaluation in conceptual design stage. The newly introduced Mechatronic Multi-criteria Profile (MMP) includes various quantitative evaluation criteria such as machine intelligence, reliability, complexity, flexibility and cost. The Choquet integral-based neural network will be used for the aggregation of criteria and fitting the intuitive requirements for decision-making in the presence of interacting criteria. Finally, a case study of designing a robotic visual servoing system is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Therefore, a valid model for the dynamic relation between surface EMG (an indirect measured of the muscle's neural input) and the torque should take the form of a Multiple-Input/Single-Output (MISO) system to account for the contributions of the different muscles. This paper presents a new method to accurately estimate the dynamic EMG/Torque relation when multiple muscles are active simultaneously. Using our method we found that flexor and extensor muscles at the ankle have different dynamic properties.

The underlying assumption in these studies is the presence of a relatively constant EEG activity in the interictal period, that is presumably interrupted by the occurrence of a seizure, at the time the seizure starts or slightly earlier. In this study, we put this assumption under test, by examining long-duration scalp EEG recordings, ranging between 22 and 72 hours, of five patients with epilepsy. For each patient, we construct functional brain networks, by calculating correlations between the scalp electrodes, and examine how these networks vary in time. The results suggest not only that the network varies over time, but it does so in a periodic fashion, with periods ranging between 11 and 25 hours.

This paper introduces a novel method to quickly visualize the different body parts related to an (temporally shift-invariant) asymmetric movement in the human gait of a patient for daily clinical usage. The goal is to provide a cheap and easy-to-use method that measures the gait asymmetry and display results in a perceptual and intuitive way.

A mixed effects model framework for the assessment of nonlinear interactions in event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by identical successive stimuli.	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			RESPONSES	The recording of brain event-related potentials (ERPs) is a widely used technique to investigate the neural basis of sensory perception and cognitive processing in humans. A commonly used assumption, when dealing with potentially overlapping ERPs elicited by successive stimuli with inter-stimulus interval (ISI) smaller than the latency of the ERPs, is that their interaction is linear. These overlaps are usually dealt by using averaged waveforms, mostly to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and performing algebraic waveform subtractions. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis of linear interactions by providing a statistical framework that examines the presence of nonlinear additive effects between overlapping ERPs elicited by successive stimuli with short ISIs. The statistical analysis is designed for single trial rather than averaged waveforms. The results suggest that there are no nonlinear additive effects due to the time overlap per se but that, for the range of ISIs examined, the second ERP is modulated by the presence of the first stimulus irrespective of whether there is time overlap or not. In other words, two ERPs that overlap in time can still be written as an addition of two ERPs, with the second ERP being different to the first. The modulation effect on the second ERP by the first stimulus varies for different ISIs.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the relationship between endogenous catecholamine and cardiac dysfunction at the onset and during the first week after SAH. Methods: Forty consecutive patients admitted for acute SAH without known heart disease were included. Catecholamine plasma concentrations and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were documented on admission, on day 1 (D1), and day 7 (D7). Results: At baseline, 24 patients had a World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies score (WFNS) of one or two; the remaining 16 had a WFNS between three and five. Twenty patients showed signs of cardiac dysfunction on admission, including six with left ventricle (LV) systolodiastolic dysfunction and 14 with pure LV diastolic dysfunction. On admission, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and Troponin Ic (cTnI) plasmatic levels were higher in patients with the higher WFNS score and in patients with altered cardiac function (all P < 0.05). Among patients with cardiac injury, heart function was restored within one week in 13 patients, while seven showed persistent LV diastolic dysfunction (P = 0.002). Plasma BNP, cTnI, and catecholamine levels exerted a decrease towards normal values between D1 and D7. Conclusion: Our findings show that cardiac dysfunction seen early after SAH was associated with both a rapid and sustained endogenous catecholamine release and WFNS score. SAH-induced cardiac dysfunction was regressive over the first week and paralleled the normalization of catecholamine concentration.

J	Martins, D; English, AM				Martins, Dorival; English, Ann M.			SOD1 oxidation and formation of soluble aggregates in yeast: Relevance to sporadic ALS development	REDOX BIOLOGY			English	Article						Wild-type Sod1; Oxidative PTMs; Soluble aggregates; Sporadic ALS; Yeast	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE ACTIVITY; CYTOCHROME-C PEROXIDASE; CU,ZN-SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; INTERMEMBRANE SPACE; DISULFIDE REDUCTION; STRESS; DISEASES; MODELS	Misfolding and aggregation of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Sod1) are observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in Sod1 lead to familial ALS (FALS), which is a late-onset disease. Since oxidative damage to proteins increases with age, it had been proposed that oxidation of Sod1 mutants may trigger their misfolding and aggregation in FALS. However, over 90% of ALS cases are sporadic (SALS) with no obvious genetic component. We hypothesized that oxidation could also trigger the misfolding and aggregation of wild-type Sod1 and sought to confirm this in a cellular environment. Using quiescent, stationary-phase yeast cells as a model for non-dividing motor neurons, we probed for post-translational modification (PTM) and aggregation of wild-type Sod1 extracted from these cells. By size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), we isolated two populations of Sod1 from yeast: a low-molecular weight (LMW) fraction that is catalytically active and a catalytically inactive, high-molecular weight (HMW) fraction. High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis revealed that LMW Sod1 displays no PTMs but HMW Sod1 is oxidized at Cys146 and His71, two critical residues for the stability and folding of the enzyme. HMW Sod1 is also oxidized at His120, a copper ligand, which will promote loss of this catalytic metal cofactor essential for SOD activity. Monitoring the fluorescence of a Sod1-green-fluorescent-protein fusion (Sod1-GFP) extracted from yeast chromosomally expressing this fusion, we find that HMW Sod1-GFP levels increase up to 40-fold in old cells. Thus, we speculate that increased misfolding and inclusion into soluble aggregates is a consequence of elevated oxidative modifications of wild-type Sod1 as cells age. Our observations argue that oxidative damage to wild-type Sod1 initiates the protein misfolding mechanisms that give rise to SALS. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These are used jointly to define the beginnings and endings of the 123 cycles in the data divided unevenly over ten trials. Two levels of registration were used. The first was a landmark registration of each trial to a periodic image of itself with the period fixed at 712 milliseconds. The 123 tangential velocity cycles were then subjected to a continuous registration over this fixed cycle length. The amounts of across-trial and within-cycle phase variation, respectively, were surprisingly small, indicating tight neural control over the behavior. Within-cycle phase variation was primarily due to variation in the trajectories of the ball between throw and catch.

Like other aspects of posttranscriptional gene regulation discussed in this collection of reviews, the intracellular trafficking of mRNAs is modulated by a complex regulatory code implicating specific cis-regulatory elements, RNA-binding proteins, and cofactors that function combinatorially to dictate precise localization mechanisms. In this review, we first discuss the functional benefits of transcript localization, the regulatory principles involved, and specific molecular mechanisms that have been described for a few well-characterized mRNAs. We also overview some of the emerging genomic and imaging technologies that have provided significant insights into this layer of gene regulation. Finally, we highlight examples of human diseases where defective transcript localization has been documented.

Imaging of repeated episodes of demyelination and remyelination in multiple sclerosis	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; Multiple sclerosis; Magnetization transfer ratio; Remyelination	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER RATIO; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; WHITE-MATTER; MYELIN WATER; LESIONS; BRAIN; EVOLUTION; MS; AXONS	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by the formation of demyelinating lesions in the white matter (WM). However, the timecourse of the evolution of healthy white matter into fully demyelinated lesions in MS is not well understood. We use a recently proposed technique to examine magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) timecourses in lesions segmented from MTR images in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). In both groups we found MTR lesions forming both in previously normal appearing WM (de novo lesions) as well as in previously lesional tissue that appears to be experiencing a second round of inflammatory demyelination (repeat lesions). Both de novo and repeat lesions exhibited significant, but incomplete MTR recovery, suggesting partial remyelination; post-lesion MTR values in de novo lesions were similar to pre-lesion values in repeat lesions. Both de novo and repeat lesions were found in subjects in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive stages of MS, and repeat lesions appeared relatively more common in the secondary progressive phase. These observations support the hypothesis that entirely demyelinated lesions found on histopathology are the result of multiple episodes of demyelination and incomplete remyelination, and may have implications for MS treatment development efforts aimed at neuroprotection and enhancing remyelination.

However, this technique has been only rarely used in newborns until now, because of the challenges to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution in newborns. Objective: To compare two methods of ASL-PWI (i.e., single inversion-time pulsed arterial spin labeling [single TI PASL], and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling [pCASL]) to assess brain perfusion in asphyxiated newborns treated with therapeutic hypothermia and in healthy newborns. Design/methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of term asphyxiated newborns meeting the criteria for therapeutic hypothermia; four additional healthy term newborns were also included as controls. Each of the enrolled newborns was scanned at least once during the first month of life. Each MRI scan included conventional anatomical imaging, as well as PASL and pCASL PWI-MRI. Control and labeled images were registered separately to reduce the effect of motion artifacts. For each scan, the axial slice at the level of the basal ganglia was used for comparisons. Each scan was scored for its image quality. Quantification of whole-slice cerebral blood flow (CBF) was done afterwards using previously described formulas. Results: A total number of 61 concomitant PASL and pCASL scans were obtained in nineteen asphyxiated newborns treated with therapeutic hypothermia and four healthy newborns. After discarding the scans with very poor image quality, 75% (46/61) remained for comparison between the two ASL methods. pCASL images presented a significantly superior image quality score compared to PASL images (p < 0.0001). Strong correlation was found between the CBF measured by PASL and pCASL (r = 0.61, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that both ASL methods are feasible to assess brain perfusion in healthy and sick newborns. However, pCASL might be a better choice over PASL in newborns, as pCASL perfusion maps had a superior image quality that allowed a more detailed identification of the different brain structures.

Correlation between brain volume change and T2 relaxation time induced by dehydration and rehydration: Implications for monitoring atrophy in clinical studies	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Brain volumetry; Brain water content; T2 relaxation time	GRAY-MATTER ATROPHY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PARENCHYMAL FRACTION; REGISTRATION; EPILEPSY; IMAGES; ROBUST; MS	Brain volume change measured from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a widely used and useful in vivo measure of irreversible tissue loss. These measurements, however, can be influenced by reversible factors such as shifts in brain water content. Given the strong effect of water on T2 relaxation, we investigated whether an estimate of T2 relaxation time would correlate with brain volume changes induced by physiologically manipulating hydration status. We used a clinically feasible estimate of T2 ("pseudo-T2") computed from a dual turbo spin-echo MRI sequence and correlated pseudo-T2 changes to percent brain volume changes in 12 healthy subjects after dehydration overnight (16-hour thirsting) and rehydration (drinking 1.5 L of water). We found that the brain volume significantly increased between the dehydrated and rehydrated states (mean brain volume change = 0.36%, p = 0.0001) but did not change significantly during the dehydration interval (mean brain volume change = 0.04%, p = 0.57). The changes in brain volume and pseudo-T2 significantly correlated with each other, with marginal and conditional correlations (R-2) of 0.44 and 0.65, respectively. Our results show that pseudo-T2 may be used in conjunction with the measures of brain volume to distinguish reversible water fluctuations and irreversible brain tissue loss (atrophy) and to investigate disease mechanisms related to neuro-inflammation, e.g., in multiple sclerosis, where edema-related water fluctuations may occur with disease activity and anti-inflammatory treatment.

Canadian Pediat Demyelinating Dis	Magnetization transfer ratio recovery in new lesions decreases during adolescence in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis patients	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						MRI; Multiple sclerosis; Remyelination; Pediatric multiple sclerosis	DEVELOPING RHESUS-MONKEY; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CHILDHOOD-ONSET; REMYELINATION EFFICIENCY; AXON OVERPRODUCTION; CNS REMYELINATION; NATURAL-HISTORY; WHITE-MATTER; BRAIN; CHILDREN	Children and adolescents diagnosed with multiple sclerosis rarely accrue physical disability early in their disease. This could be explained by greater remyelination in children, a capacity that may be lost in adolescence or early adulthood. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) MRI can be used to quantify changes in myelin in MS. We used serial MTR imaging and longitudinal random effects analysis to quantify recovery of MTR in acute lesions and to evaluate MTR changes in normal-appearing tissue in 19 adolescent MS patients. Our objective was to determine whether younger adolescents have a greater capacity for remyelination and whether this decreases as patients approach adulthood. We detected a significant decrease in MTR recovery between ages 16 and 20 years (p = 0.023), with older subjects approaching typical recovery levels for adult-onset MS. MTR recovery in acute MS lesions decreases with age in adolescents, suggesting loss of remyelination capacity. This may be related to the conclusion of primary myelination or other developmental factors. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It is presumed that these effects are produced through their interaction with octopamine receptors. Octopamine, an important biogenic monoamine in insects, where it functions as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and a neurohormone. Octopamine activates G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which, in turn, activate or inhibit various signal transduction pathways. Here the a-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor from Periplaneta americana (Pa oal) was expressed in a yeast cell line (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This is the first time, to our knowledge, that an insect receptor has been expressed in yeast cells. We determined that a variety of monoterpenoids and related aromatic compounds interact with this Pa oal, and that most of these compounds act as inverse agonists to this constitutively active receptor. However, we observed that the aromatic monoterpenoid, carvacrol, acts as a positive modulator of Pa oal.

Cognitive change and neuroimaging following innnnunoablative therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in multiple sclerosis: A pilot study	MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; Stem cell; Immunoablation; MRI; Information processing speed; Cognition	BONE-MARROW-TRANSPLANTATION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT; BRAIN ATROPHY; MEMORY; SPEED; MS; MATTER; ACQUISITION; VOLUME	Background: Individuals with MS undergoing immunoablative therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) show substantial decrease in brain volume over 2.4 months, presumably from chemotoxic effects, although other mechanisms have also been postulated. Objective: We examined whether volume loss was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in cognition. White and gray matter volumes, and the effect of stem cell dosage were considered. Methods: Seven individuals with rapidly progressing MS and poor prognosis underwent high dose immunosuppression and autologous HSCT. Neuropsychological testing and MRI scans were performed at baseline, 2 and 24 months post-procedure. Results: Cognitive impairment was noted at all times in most participants. Median decline of 1.39% in total brain volume was noted 2 months post-HSCT. By 24 months a further decline of 1.65% was noted. At 2 months significant decline was observed for areas of executive functioning. At 24 months almost no significant declines were noted. No significant correlations were found between cognitive decline and change in imaging variables or stem cell dosage. Conclusions: Cognition changed in the early period following treatment but with little apparent relationship to volume changes. With temporal distance from the HSCT procedure, cognition returned to baseline levels. With the caution of a very small sample, preliminary results suggest that immunoablation and HSCT may have no lasting deleterious effects on cognition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Jacobian integration method increases the statistical power to measure gray matter atrophy in multiple sclerosis	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Gray matter; Atrophy; Sample size; Jacobian integration	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; CORTICAL LESION DETECTION; VOLUME CHANGES; INTRACORTICAL LESIONS; INVERSION-RECOVERY; MR-IMAGES; BRAIN; SEGMENTATION; DEMYELINATION; REGISTRATION	Gray matter atrophy provides important insights into neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis ( MS) and can be used as a marker of neuroprotection in clinical trials. Jacobian integration is a method for measuring volume change that uses integration of the local Jacobian determinants of the nonlinear deformation field registering two images, and is a promising tool for measuring gray matter atrophy. Our main objective was to compare the statistical power of the Jacobian integration method to commonly used methods in terms of the sample size required to detect a treatment effect on gray matter atrophy. We used multi-center longitudinal data from relapsing-remitting MS patients and evaluated combinations of cross-sectional and longitudinal pre-processing with SIENAX/FSL, SPM, and FreeSurfer, as well as the Jacobian integration method. The Jacobian integration method outperformed these other commonly used methods, reducing the required sample size by a factor of 4-5. The results demonstrate the advantage of using the Jacobian integration method to assess neuroprotection in MS clinical trials. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Combined with multiple indications of enhanced perceptual functioning in autism, and indications of atypical motor functioning, enhanced plasticity predicts a superior variability in functional cortical allocation, predominant in perceptual and motor regions. Method: To test this prediction, we scanned 23 autistics and 22 typical participants matched on age, FSIQ, Raven percentile scores and handedness during a visuo-motor imitation task. For each participant, the coordinates of the strongest task-related activation peak were extracted in the primary (Brodmann area 4) and supplementary (BA 6) motor cortex, the visuomotor superior parietal cortex (BA 7), and the primary (BA 17) and associative (BAs 18 + 19) visual areas. Mean signal changes for each ROI in both hemispheres, and the number of voxels composing the strongest activation cluster were individually extracted to compare intensity and size of the signal between groups. For each ROI, in each hemisphere, and for every participant, the distance from their respective group average was used as a variable of interest to determine group differences in localization variability using repeated measures ANOVAs. Between-group comparison of whole-brain activation was also performed. Results: Both groups displayed a higher mean variability in the localization of activations in the associative areas compared to the primary visual or motor areas. However, despite this shared increased variability in associative cortices, a direct between-group comparison of the individual variability in localization of the activation revealed a significantly greater variability in the autistic group than in the typical group in the left visuo-motor superior parietal cortex (BA 7) and in the left associative visual areas (BAs 18 + 19). Conclusion: Different and possibly unique strategies are used by each autistic individual. That enhanced variability in localization of activations in the autistic group is found in regions typically more variable in non-autistics raises the possibility that autism involves an enhancement and / or an alteration of typical plasticity mechanisms. The current study also highlights the necessity to verify, in fMRI studies involving autistic people, that hypoactivation at the group level does not result from each individual successfully completing a task using a unique brain allocation, even by comparison to his own group.

To delineate the characteristics of this epileptic network, we collected EEG/fMRI data from 23 patients with frontal lobe epilepsy. For each patient, EEG/fMRI analysis was first performed to determine the BOLD response to epileptic spikes. The maximum activation cluster in the frontal lobe was then chosen as the seed to identify the epileptic network in fMRI data. Functional connectivity analysis seeded at the same region was also performed in 63 healthy control subjects. Nine features were used to evaluate the differences of epileptic network patterns in three connection levels between patients and controls. Compared with control subjects, patients showed overall more functional connections between the epileptogenic region and the rest of the brain and higher laterality. However, the significantly increased connections were located in the neighborhood of the seed, but the connections between the seed and remote regions actually decreased. Comparing fMRI runs with interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) and without IEDs, the patient-specific connectivity pattern was not changed significantly. These findings regarding patient-specific connectivity patterns of epileptic networks in FLE reflect local high connectivity and connections with distant regions differing from those of healthy controls. Moreover, the difference between the two groups in most features was observed in the strictest of the three connection levels. The abnormally high connectivity might reflect a predominant attribute of the epileptic network, which may facilitate propagation of epileptic activity among regions in the network.

Disparity between the degree of radiographic structural damage and the severity of symptoms implies that factors other than the joint pathology itself contribute to the pain. Peripheral and central sensitization have been suggested as two of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to pain in OA. The aim of this study was to explore in symptomatic knee OA patients, the structural changes assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that could be used as markers of neuropathic pain (NP). Methods: This cross-sectional observational pilot study included 50 knee OA patients with moderate to severe pain (VAS >= 40) in the target knee. The presence of NP was determined based on the PainDETECT questionnaire. Among the 50 patients included, 25 had PainDETECT score <= 12 (unlikely NP), 9 had PainDETECT score between 13 and 18 (uncertain NP) and 16 had PainDETECT score >= 19 (likely NP). WOMAC, PainDETECT, and VAS pain scores as well as knee MRI were assessed. Results: Data showed no significant difference in demographic characteristics between the three groups. However, a positive and statistically significant association was found between the WOMAC pain (P < 0.001), function (P < 0.001), stiffness (P = 0.007) and total (P < 0.001) scores as well as higher VAS pain score (P = 0.023), and PainDETECT scores. Although no difference was found in the cartilage volume between groups, the presence of meniscal extrusion in both medial (P = 0.006) and lateral (P = 0.023) compartments, and presence of meniscal tears in the lateral compartment (P = 0.011), were significantly associated with increasing PainDETECT score. Moreover, the presence of bone marrow lesions in the lateral plateau and the extent of the synovial membrane thickness in the lateral recess were associated with increasing PainDETECT scores (P = 0.032, P = 0.027, respectively). Conclusions: In this study, meniscal lesions, particularly extrusion, were found to be among the strongest risk factors for NP in knee OA patients.

CPEB1, the founding member of this family, has become an important model for illustrating general principles of translational control by cytoplasmic polyadenylation in gametogenesis, cancer etiology, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Although the biological functions of the other members of this protein family in vertebrates are just beginning to emerge, it is already evident that they, too, mediate important processes, such as cancer etiology and higher cognitive function. In Drosophila, the CPEB proteins Orb and Orb2 play key roles in oogenesis and in neuronal function, as do related proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans and Aplysia. We review the biochemical features of the CPEB proteins, discuss their activities in several biological systems, and illustrate how understanding CPEB activity in model organisms has an important impact on neurological disease.

Registration algorithms are commonly validated against simulation and real data. Both validations are critical in a comprehensive analysis: On one hand, the simulation data provides ground truth registration results and can therefore accurately measure the performance of algorithms. It is also flexible and can include different levels of noise and outlier data. On the other hand, real data include factors that are not modeled in simulations and is therefore used to test algorithms against real-world applications. Simulated MR images are provided in the BrainWeb database and have been extensively used to validate and improve image registration algorithms. Simulated US images that correspond to these MR images are of great interest due to the growing interest in the use of ultrasound (US) as a real-time modality that can be easily used during interventions. In this work, we first generate digital brain phantoms by distribution of US scatterers based on the tissue probability maps provided in BrainWeb. We then generate US images of these digital phantoms using the publicly available Field II program. We show that these images look similar to the real US images of the brain. Furthermore, since both the US and MR images are simulated from the same tissue probability map, they are perfectly registered. We then deform the digital phantoms to simulate brain deformations that happen during neurosurgery, and generate US images of the deformed phantoms. We provide some examples for the use of such simulated US images for testing and enhancing image registration algorithms.	[Rivaz, Hassan; Collins, D.

Augmented reality (AR) visualization may be used to show vessels not visible when looking at the brain surface and to aid navigation by bringing into spatial alignment pre-operative vascular data with the real patient anatomy. In using AR, we may aid the surgeon in planning the craniotomy to obtain the optimal resection corridor and reduce the time to localize and identify important vessels. In the following paper, we describe the first uses of our AR neuronavigation system in the operating room (OR). Specifically, we describe the system's use in three different neurovascular cases, an aneurysm case, an arteriovenous malfromation, and a dural arteriovenous fistula. Furthermore, we give a qualitative evaluation based on comments from the OR and post-operative discussions with the neurosurgeons.

MCPH is genetically heterogeneous and can exhibit additional clinical features that overlap with related disorders including Seckel syndrome, Meier-Gorlin syndrome, and microcephalic osteodysplastic dwarfism. In this review, we discuss the key proteins mutated in MCPH. To date, MCPH-causing mutations have been identified in twelve different genes, many of which encode proteins that are involved in cell cycle regulation or are present at the centrosome, an organelle crucial for mitotic spindle assembly and cell division. We highlight recent findings on MCPH proteins with regard to their role in cell cycle progression, centrosome function, and early brain development.

Historic Stroke Motor Severity Score Predicts Progression in TIA/Minor Stroke	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK; MINOR STROKE; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; RISK; DETERIORATION; PROGNOSIS; TIA	Background: Transient ischemic attack (TA) and minor stroke have a high risk of early neurological deterioration, and patients who experience early improvement are at risk of deterioration. We generated a score for quantifying the worst reported motor and speech deficits and assessed whether this predicted outcome. Methods: 510 TIA or minor stroke (NIHSS<4) patients were included. The Historical Stroke Severity Score (HSSS) prospectively quantified the patient's description of the worst motor or speech deficits. The HSSS was rated at the time of first assessment with more severe deficits scoring higher. Motor HSSS included assessments of arm and leg motor power (score total 0-5). Speech HSSS assessed severity of dysarthria and aphasia (total 0-3). The association between motor and speech HISSS and symptom progression was assessed during the 90-day follow-up period. Results: The proportion of patients in each category of the motor HSSS was 0: 43% (216/510), 1: 22%(110/510), 2: 17% (89/510), 3: 7% (371510), 4: 5% (28/510) and 5: 6% (30/510). Motor HSSS was associated with symptom progression (p=0.004) but not recurrent stroke. Speech HSSS was not associated with either progression or recurrent stroke. Motor HSSS predicted disability (p=0.002) and intracranial occlusion (p=0.012). Disability increased with increasing motor HSSS. Conclusions: Taking a detailed history about the severity of motor deficits, but not speech, predicted outcome in TIA and minor stroke patients. A score based on the patient's description of the severity of motor symptoms predicted symptom progression, intracranial occlusion and functional outcome, but not recurrent stroke in a TIA and minor stroke population.

Treatment for cryoglobulinemic and non-cryoglobulinemic peripheral neuropathy associated with hepatitis C virus infection	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							IMMUNE-MEDIATED POLYNEUROPATHIES; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PEGYLATED INTERFERON-ALPHA; MIXED CRYOGLOBULINEMIA; LONG-TERM; IMMUNOADSORPTION APHERESIS; II CRYOGLOBULINEMIA; SYSTEMIC VASCULITIS; ANTIVIRAL THERAPY; PLUS RIBAVIRIN	Background Peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurologic complication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The pathophysiology of the neuropathy associated with HCV is not definitively known; however, proposed mechanisms include cryoglobulin deposition in the vasa nervorum and HCV-mediated vasculitis. The optimal treatment for HCV-related peripheral neuropathy has not been established. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions (including interferon alfa, interferon alfa plus ribavirin, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, plasma exchange, and rituximab) for cryoglobulinemic or non-cryoglobulinemic peripheral neuropathy associated with HCV infection. Search methods On 26 August 2014, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also searched two trials registers, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) (October 2014), and three other databases. We checked references in identified trials and requested information from trial authors to identify any additional published or unpublished data. Selection criteria We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving participants with cryoglobulinemic or non-cryoglobulinemic peripheral neuropathy associated with HCV infection. We considered any intervention (including interferon alfa, interferon alfa plus ribavirin, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, plasma exchange, and rituximab) alone or in combination versus placebo or another intervention ('head-to-head' comparison study design) evaluated after a minimum interval to follow-up of at least six months. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. The planned primary outcome was change in sensory impairment (using any validated sensory neuropathy scale or quantitative sensory testing) at the end of the follow-up period. Other planned outcomes were: change in impairment (any validated combined sensory and motor neuropathy scale), change in disability (any validated disability scale), electrodiagnostic measures, number of participants with improved symptoms of neuropathy (global impression of change), and severe adverse events. Main results Four trials of HCV-related cryoglobulinemia fulfiled selection criteria and the review authors included three in quantitative synthesis. All studies were at high risk of bias. No trial addressed the primary outcome of change in sensory impairment. No trial addressed secondary outcomes of change in combined sensory and motor impairment, disability, or electrodiagnostic measures. A single trial of HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia treated with pegylated interferon alfa (peginterferon alfa), ribavirin, and rituximab versus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin did not show a significant difference in the number of participants with improvement in neuropathy at 36 months post treatment (risk ratio (RR) 4.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 59.31, n = 9). One study of interferon alfa (n = 22) and two studies of rituximab (n = 61) provided adverse event data. Severe adverse events were no more common with interferon alfa (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 128.02) or rituximab (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 67.06) compared to the control group. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of RCTs and quasi-RCTs addressing the effects of interventions for peripheral neuropathy associated with HCV infection. At present, there is insufficient evidence from RCTs and quasi-RCTs to make evidence-based decisions about treatment.

The proposed CDSP executes the neural source identification through an on-the-fly spike-sorting process followed by neural decoding of the bladder volume. In addition to in situ measurement of the urine volume, its wireless transmission to a base station, and informing user about the bladder status, this sensory information is intended for a closed-loop electrical stimulation interface dedicated to tune up the stimulation parameters to ensure continence and bladder voiding. To assess feasibility, the CDSP prototype was deployed in a low-power FPGA (Actel Igloo). The results of the tests performed using synthetic realistic signals and real signals recorded from rats' bladder during acute experiments, show the feasibility of the proposed device.

First, the MRI is split into right and left hemispheres components whose fractal dimensions (FD) are estimated using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Then, the obtained FD values are used to characterize healthy and AVM-affected brain MRIs. Using a database of twenty-eight images, and ten-fold cross validation, classification by a support vector machine (SVM) was 100% accurate when using either a linear or a radial basis Gaussian kernel, and the total image processing time was 32.75 s on a midrange PC station. It is concluded that the presented cerebral AVM detection system is both simple and accurate, and its processing time makes it compatible for use in a clinical environment, should it performance be confirmed with a larger image database.

Although the information processing in the brain is mostly done through neuron's electrical activities, there might be significant information in presynaptic neurochemicals. Recent studies suggest concurrent measurement of interrelated brain's electrical and neurochemical activity may lead to better understanding of brain function in addition to developing optimal neural prosthetics. We present a power efficient implantable CMOS microsystem for simultaneous measurement of Action Potential (AP) and neurotransmitter concentration. It consist of a nano-power neural amplifier for action potential detection and amplification; a nano-power current conveyor potentiostat which senses picoscale to microscale current that corresponds to micromolar neurotransmitter concentration; and a micro-power Sigma Delta Analog to Digital Convertor (ADC) to convert the analog signal (AP or neurotransmitter concentration) to digital code.

Our mission in underground mines stems from the profound need of geo-positioning systems that can accurately localize endangered miners and their heavy machinery in one of Earth's most harsh and rough environments. In underground mines, complex channels' responses to wireless transmitted signals challenge traditional localization techniques, yet they fail to defeat our innovative, cost-effective and accurate fingerprint-based positioning techniques that use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and exploit space-time diversity. Being among the pioneers in underground communications research, we bring forward a more sophisticated and accurate fingerprint-based positioning technique that exploits spatial transmission diversity in the presence of more than one transmitter T-x and/or receiver R-x antenna, such as in the case of single/multiple input multiple output (SIMO/MIMO) communication systems. More importantly, an advanced study is conducted to reduce the cost of fingerprint-acquisition trading off pinpoint accuracy for lower complexity and better ANNs' design. By challenging the localization system using less data measurements, we prove that ANNs, when properly designed, succeed to attain high positioning accuracies even when localizing in measurement gaps that were not seen in the training phase.

The crucial difference between effective and struggling readers is their executive functions (EFs), and improved functions impact positively on learning to read and reading to learn. Objectives: Firstly, to show that high-risk and struggling students' persisting language and reading difficulties are accompanied by executive dysfunctions. Secondly, to present one student's daily struggles at school in a narrative based on teacher, parent and child interviews. Method: This retrospective study is based on speech-language pathology (SLP) evaluations of a clinical sample of 23 girls and boys aged 6-16 from a range of middle class families. While language and reading evaluations were tailored to the students' particular situation, i.e. age, grade, languages or complaint, EFs were examined in all with the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function teacher questionnaire. Results: Virtually all students exhibited executive dysfunctions, and many showed a high risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that inclusion of EFs in SLP evaluations is valuable in uncovering executive dysfunction comorbidity that may underlie persisting reading disorders. It is proposed that speech-language pathologists explicitly and routinely braid language and reading with EFs in their evaluations so to effectively predict, uncover and prevent persisting reading disabilities in students.

There is mounting evidence to support a role for developmentally regulated epigenetic variation in the molecular etiology of the disorder. Here, we describe a systematic study of schizophrenia-associated methylomic variation in the adult brain and its relationship to changes in DNA methylation across human fetal brain development. Results: We profile methylomic variation in matched prefrontal cortex and cerebellum brain tissue from schizophrenia patients and controls, identifying disease-associated differential DNA methylation at multiple loci, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, and confirming these differences in an independent set of adult brain samples. Our data reveal discrete modules of co-methylated loci associated with schizophrenia that are enriched for genes involved in neurodevelopmental processes and include loci implicated by genetic studies of the disorder. Methylomic data from human fetal cortex samples, spanning 23 to 184 days post-conception, indicates that schizophrenia-associated differentially methylated positions are significantly enriched for loci at which DNA methylation is dynamically altered during human fetal brain development. Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis that schizophrenia has an important early neurodevelopmental component, and suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may mediate these effects.

Both absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the prototypic seizures found in generalized epilepsies, are classically seen as the result of a rapid, synchronous recruitment of neuronal networks resulting in impairment of consciousness and/or convulsive semiology. The term generalized also refers to electroencephalographic presentation, with bilateral, synchronous activity, such as the classical 3 Hz spike and wave discharges of typical absence epilepsy. However, findings obtained from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies over the last few years, contradict this view, showing a rather focal onset for most of the so-called generalized seizure types. Therefore, we ask here the question whether "generalized epilepsy" does indeed exist.

Prolonging life: legal, ethical, and social dilemmas	RETHINKING MORTALITY: EXPLORING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences		English	Editorial Material; Book Chapter						resuscitation; end of life; organ donation; death; physician-assisted dying		The ability of modern medicine to prolong life has raised a variety of difficult legal, ethical, and social issues on which reasonable minds can differ. Among these are the morality of euthanasia in cases of deep coma or irreversible injury, as well as the Dead Donor Rule with respect to organ harvesting and transplants. As science continues to refine and develop lifesaving technologies, questions remain as to how much medical effort and financial resources should be expended to prolong the lives of patients suspended between life and death. At what point should death be considered irreversible? What criteria should be used to determine when to withhold or withdraw life-prolonging treatments in cases of severe brain damage and terminal illness? To explore these complex dilemmas, Steve Paulson, executive producer and host of To the Best of Our Knowledge, moderated a discussion panel. Pediatrician Sam Shemie, hospice medical director Christopher P. Comfort, bioethicist Mildred Z. Solomon, and attorney Barbara Coombs Lee examined the underlying assumptions and considerations that ultimately shape individual and societal decisions surrounding these issues. The following is an edited transcript of the discussion that occurred November 12, 2013, 7:00-8:30 PM, at the New York Academy of Sciences in New York City.

Marker-based systems are the most favored methods of human motion assessment and gait analysis, however, these systems require specific equipment and expertise and are cumbersome, costly and difficult to use. In this paper we compare two low-cost and marker-less systems that are: (1) A Kinect in front of a treadmill and (2) a set of two camcorders on the sides of the treadmill, used to reconstruct the skeleton of a subject during walk. We validated our method with ground truth data obtained with markers manually placed on the subject's body. Finally, we present an application for asymmetric gait recognition. Our results on different subjects showed that, compared to the Kinect, the two-camcorder approach was very efficient and provided accurate measurements for gait assessment.

In this paper we show how this representation can be used to perform blind speaker adaptation of hybrid DNN-HMM speech recognition system and we report excellent results on a French language audio transcription task. The implemenation is very simple. An audio file is first diarized and each speaker cluster is represented by an i-vector. Acoustic feature vectors are augmented by the corresponding i-vectors before being presented to the DNN. (The same i-vector is used for all acoustic feature vectors aligned with a given speaker.) This supplementary information improves the DNN's ability to discriminate between phonetic events in a speaker independent way without having to make any modification to the DNN training algorithms. We report results on the ETAPE 2011 transcription task, and show that i-vector based speaker adaptation is effective irrespective of whether cross-entropy or sequence training is used. For cross-entropy training, we obtained a word error rate (WER) reduction from 22.16% to 20.67% whereas for sequence training the WER reduces from 19.93% to 18.40%.

This method is applied in the context of a DNN configured for auto-encoder based low dimensional bottleneck (AE-BN) feature extraction where the derived features are used as input to a continuous Gaussian density hidden Markov model (HMM/GMM) based ASR decoder. While AE-BN features are known to provide significant reduction in ASR word error rate (WER) with respect to more conventional spectral magnitude based features, there is no general agreement on how these networks can reduce the impact of speaker variability by incorporating prior knowledge of the speaker. An approach is presented in this paper where spectrum based DNN inputs are augmented with speaker inputs that are derived from separate regression based speaker transformations. It is shown the proposed method could reduce the WER by 3% relative to the best speaker adapted AE-BN CDHMM system.

Successively, a computational system for handwriting analysis is presented and some considerations are exploited about the use of the model to investigate insurgence and monitoring of some neuromuscular diseases. The experimental results show the validity of the proposed approach and highlight some directions for further research.	[Impedovo, D.; Pirlo, G.; Mangini, F.

Their behavior varies based on their location in relation to and the activity of the shunting through the index AVM. The intuitive expectation supported by numerous reports is that these aneurysms should regress if the AVM is excluded from the circulation. We describe a case of 46-year-old man who presented with a posterior fossa AVM with an aneurysm on the posterior inferior cerebellar artery feeding the AVM. The nidus of the AVM was successfully excluded by glue embolization, with initial regression of the PICA aneurysm on serial imaging. Five years after the endovascular treatment, the aneurysm showed significant re-growth necessitating endovascular coiling. This case presents the re-growth of an AVM-related aneurysm and emphasizes the importance of long-term follow-up of such aneurysms even if the AVM is completely excluded.

This paper investigates IT addiction and aims to identify the mechanisms behind its development. Based on a thorough review of the literature, we conceptualize IT addiction as a psychological dependency on IT that involves excessive use of technology. Furthermore, we identify the elements that are associated with the formation of addiction. Based on the analysis of 12 in-depth interviews and 182 qualitative surveys, we developed a process theory of IT addiction that explains how these behaviors progress through time. The model highlights the key elements that are associated with IT-related addictive behaviors and shows how they relate to the technology, the user and the environment. It also highlights the problematic consequences of such behaviors on the well-being of addicted users.

It is characterized by white matter injury, associated with inflammation. This work aimed to assess the impact of inflammation on cerebral oxygen saturation (sO(2)) using depth-sensitive photoacoustic tomography (PAT). The aspects of PVL were reproduced in a rodent model by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the corpus callosum. The results of this exploratory work reveal lower sO(2) values in LPS group, as compared to sham controls; showing decreased values in the corpus callosum and in the left cortex, ipsilateral to the injection site. Inter-hemispherical connectivity was not affected by LPS injection, as shown by functional connectivity analysis. This study supports the use of PAT as a non-invasive tool to assess oxygenation values in vivo in the newborn brain.

This was evaluated experimentally to establish the best correction with dioptric power shifts. We used Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure Oxy-, Deoxy- and Total-hemoglobin concentration changes in the brain while viewing images and reading a Snellen chart. Participants were tested with their usual correction (no diopter power shift (0 D)), with a 0.25 diopter power shift (0.25 D), and with a 0.5 diopter power shift (0.5 D). The concept of Approximate Entropy (AE) was applied to quantify the regularity of these hemoglobin time series of finite length. AE computations are based on the likelihood that similar templates in a time series remain similar on the next incremental comparison, so that time series with large AE have high irregular fluctuation. We found that the dioptric power shift eliciting the highest AE indicates the clearest visual condition for subjects. This technique may impact the current way in which ophthalmic lenses are prescribed.	[Lugo, J.

Prospective neuropsychological studies indicate that cognitive performance may be an excellent indicator of future progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, particularly when episodic memory is combined with tasks relying on executive control and language tasks. Research on neuropsychiatric symptoms reveal that depression, apathy, anxiety, and sleep disturbances can contribute to predictive models, though their sensitivity is typically lower than that found with cognitive measures. Finally, different structural brain imaging markers reveal excellent predictive accuracy. The paper discusses issues that will have to be addressed in future studies. First, it will be necessary to increase the evaluation of combined markers, as this may considerably improve predictive accuracy. Second, it will be necessary to move to earlier stages than MCI in order to expand the detection window. Third, processes of compensation and plasticity will have to be better investigated as research moves into earlier stages. The Consortium for the early identification of AD-Quebec (CIMA-Q) is presented as an instance of this approach, and potential batteries of measures are proposed.

Several studies have proposed different methods to evaluate learner's mental states in cognitive tasks. However, these studies do not take into account the nature of the cognitive task. In this paper, we have developed various categories of brain games in order to study the variation of some specific brain states (engagement, workload and distraction) depending on the type and difficulty of the game. The preliminary results showed a close relationship between the category of game, the workload mental state and learner's performance.

Recent developments have made use of biologically inspired architectures, such as the Convolutional Neural Network. The nature of the Convolutional Neural Network is that each convolutional layer of the network contains a certain number of feature maps or kernels. The number of these used has historically been determined on an ad-hoc basis. We propose a theoretical method for determining the optimal number of feature maps using the dimensions of the feature map or convolutional kernel. We find that the empirical data suggests that our theoretical method works for extremely small receptive fields, but doesn't generalize as clearly to all receptive field sizes. Furthermore, we note that architectures that are pyramidal rather than equally balanced tend to make better use of computational resources.

Gusto Study Grp	Insights from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) Cohort Study	ANNALS OF NUTRITION AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Cohort study; Metabolic neurodevelopment; Epigenetics	SOUTHAMPTON WOMENS SURVEY; EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS; DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS; BODY-FAT; BIRTH; PREGNANCY; INFANTS; MICROSTRUCTURE; METABOLISM; ADIPOSITY	Background: The dramatic emergence of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) in Asia, albeit with ethnic variation, has coincided with the rapid socioeconomic and nutritional transition taking place in the region, with the prevalence of diabetes rising 5-fold in Singapore in less than 4 decades. The Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort study recruited 1,247 expectant mothers of Chinese, Malay, or Indian ethnicity in their first trimester, with detailed longitudinal tracking - through the antenatal period, birth, and the child's first 4 years of life - to examine the potential roles of fetal, developmental, and epigenetic factors in early pathways to metabolic and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Key Messages: A number of findings with a translational and clinical focus have already emerged. In the mothers, we found that changes and differences in food consumption varied across ethnic groups, with persistence of traditional beliefs, during pregnancy and the postpartum period. During pregnancy, higher maternal glucose levels, even in the absence of gestational diabetes mellitus, had graded relations with infant adiposity. Relations between maternal emotional health and birth outcomes and neurodevelopment have been identified. Genotype (25%) and in particular gene x environment interactions (75%) shape interindividual variations in the DNA methylonne at birth. The complex effects of fixed genetic variations and different in utero environments can influence the epigenetic status at birth and the later-life phenotype. Conclusions: The richness of the clinical data in 3 ethnicities, the extent of the biospecinnen collection, and the extensive infancy and preschool follow-up have allowed us to study the biological pathways that link fetal development to health outcomes. In the coming years, more sophisticated analyses of epigenotype-phenotype relationships will become possible as the children grow and develop. Our studies will lead to the development of clinical and population-based interventions to reduce the burden of NCD. (C) 2014 S.

However, the proximate mechanisms that mediate this behaviour have received less attention. The oxytocin family of nonapeptide hormones (including isotocin in teleost fish) is thought to play an important role in regulating social behaviour across a wide range of taxa and social contexts. In the current study, we investigated the influence of exogenous administration of isotocin and an oxytocin receptor antagonist on sociality in a cooperatively breeding fish, Neolamprologus pulcher. In our first experiment, we found that a high (and a low) dose of peripherally administered exogenous isotocin decreased the time spent associating with conspecifics in N. pulcher, while an intermediate dose had no effect relative to control. In our second experiment, we found that a peripheral administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist increased grouping preference in male N. pulcher. The results of both experiments suggest that IT may inhibit grouping behaviour in this species. These results contribute to a growing body of literature suggesting that the broad generalization that the oxytocin family of nonapeptides facilitate grouping behaviour is overly simplistic, and that specific behavioural effects depend the study species and testing conditions.

We tested the hypothesis that longer fluency tasks would be more sensitive in identifying deficits in the sample. The relationship between verbal fluency performance and sustained attention was also investigated. Forty adults with vascular right-hemisphere damage were assessed using verbal fluency tasks with three different production criteria (unconstrained, phonemic, and semantic fluencies from the Montreal Communication Evaluation Battery). Performance deficits in 1-min and 2-min fluency tasks were calculated (Z score) and compared (chi-square). Results did not suggest a difference in sensitivity between the task lengths in detecting cognitive impairment. However, double dissociations were found, highlighting the contribution of extended verbal fluency tasks to neuropsychological assessment. Analyses also showed that participants exhibited greater levels of impairment in the semantic fluency task. No relationship was identified between performance in sustained attention tasks and verbal fluency tasks, regardless of the latter's duration. The combined use of longer and shorter fluency tasks in the assessment of patients with right brain damage may contribute to the identification of different executive function impairments in this sample.

Thanks to its wide availability and excellent spatial resolution, ultrasound is a mature investigation with clearly established indications, particularly in entrapment syndromes and tumors. MRI is generally a second-line examination, which provides decisive additional information thanks to its excellent contrast resolution and its multiplanar abilities. This review describes the current methods for imaging the PNS, concentrating on acquisition techniques, normal results and basic pathological semiology. Ongoing and future developments are described in order to underline the forthcoming changes in this very dynamic field of musculoskeletal radiology. (C) 2013 Editions francaises de radiologie.

Positive Florbetapir PET Amyloid Imaging in a Subject with Frequent Cortical Neuritic Plaques and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration with TDP43-Positive Inclusions	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; frontotemporal dementia; neuritic amyloid plaques; neurofibrillary degeneration	ALZHEIMERS ASSOCIATION GUIDELINES; NEUROPATHOLOGIC ASSESSMENT; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; DISEASE; TDP-43; BRAIN; DEMENTIA; PATHOLOGY; SYSTEM; AD	Abnormal neuronal accumulation and modification of TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) have recently been discovered to be defining histopathological features of particular subtypes of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and are also common in aging, particularly coexisting with hippocampal sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease pathology. This case report describes a 72 year old Hispanic male with no family history of neurological disease, who presented at age 59 with obsessive behavior, anxiety, agitation, and dysphasia. Positron emission tomography imaging using the amyloid ligand F-18 florbetapir (Amyvid) was positive. Postmortem examination revealed frequent diffuse and neuritic amyloid plaques throughout the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and striatum, Braak stage II neurofibrillary degeneration, and frequent frontal and temporal cortex TDP-43-positive neurites with rare nuclear inclusions. The case is unusual and instructive because of the co-existence of frequent cortical and diencephalic amyloid plaques with extensive TDP-43-positive histopathology in the setting of early-onset dementia and because it demonstrates that a positive cortical amyloid imaging signal in a subject with dementia does not necessarily establish that Alzheimer's disease is the sole cause.

Individuals with Turner syndrome often display social difficulties that are reminiscent of those associated with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), conditions associated with empathy and mirror-neuron system (MNS) deficits. The goal of the present study was (1) to investigate the extent to which adults with Turner syndrome display autistic and empathic traits, and (2) to probe the integrity of the MNS in this neurogenetic disorder. Sixteen individuals with Turner syndrome and 16 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched controls took part in a neuropsychological assessment where the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, the Autism Spectrum Quotient and the Empathy Quotient were administered. Functioning of the MNS was assessed by measuring motor cortex activity with transcranial magnetic stimulation during an action-observation task. Results show that individuals with Turner syndrome do not differ significantly from controls regarding autistic or empathic traits, and present normal functioning of the MNS during action observation. Correlational analysis showed a significant positive relationship between scores on the Empathy Quotient and motor facilitation during action observation, bringing further support to the hypothesis that MNS activity is related to sociocognitive competence.

However, the cognitive process by which identity is transformed is understudied. The present study aims to explore the cognitive process by which personal identity is reconstructed following disability onset. Methods: A template organizing style of interpretation was used to perform a qualitative analysis based on the Cognitive-Developmental Model of Social Identity Integration (CDMSII) using interview data from 10 participants with traumatic brain injury or traumatic spinal cord injury. Results: As suggested by the CDMSII, following the accident, participants initially tend to emphasize distinctions between their pre- and post-injury conditions. Eventually, individuals are able to create cognitive connections between pre-injury self-knowledge and how they understand their new condition. Finally, in the last stage of the identity integration process, the various identity components are recognized as part of the self. Organizing data based on the three stages of this theory was found to resonate with participants and aided the comprehension of how every stage in the identity reconstruction process is intertwined with the need for continuity through life. Conclusions: The CDMSII offers a useful heuristic for understanding long-term identity reconstruction and the present research emphasizes the importance of a sense of continuity following disability onset.

Among the few studies of cognitive stimulation in elderly, surprisingly there is no enough research comparing direct and indirect active stimulation programs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to verify wheter there are differences between two cognitive interventions approaches in older adults: a structured Working Memory (WM) Training Program versus a Poetry-based Stimulation Program. METHODS: Fourteen older adults were randomly assigned to participate into one of the two intervention groups. The assessed neurocognitive components were attention, episodic and working memory, communicative and executive functions. WM Training activities were based on Baddeley's model; Poetry-based Stimulation Program was composed by general language activities. Data were analyzed with one-way ANCOVA with Delta scores and pre and post-training tests raw scores. RESULTS: WM group improved performance on WM, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility measures, while Poetry group improved on verbal fluency and narrative discourse tasks. DISCUSSION: Both approaches presented benefits; however WM Training improved its target function with transfer effects to executive functions, being useful for future studies with a variety of dementias. Poetry-based Stimulation also improved complex linguistic abilities. Both approaches may be helpful as strategies to prevent dysfunctional aging changes.

A subset of DA neurons, mainly found in the ventral tegmental area, express VGLUT2, allowing them to package and release glutamate onto striatal spiny projection neurons and cholinergic interneurons. Some dopaminergic axon terminals release GABA. Glutamate release by DA neurons has a developmental role, facilitating axonal growth and survival, and may determine in part the critical contribution of the ventral striatum to psychostimulant-induced behavior. Vesicular glutamate coentry may have synergistic effects on vesicular DA filling. The multilingual transmission of DA neurons across multiple striatal domains and the increasing insight into the role of glutamate cotransmission in the ventral striatum highlight the importance of analyzing DA neuron transmission at the synaptic level.

These mechanisms depend on all components of the neurovascular units: neurons, glia, and vascular cells. All these cell types can produce nitric oxide (NO), a powerful vasodilator through different NO synthases. Many studies underlined the key role of NO in the maintenance of resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) as well as in the mechanisms that control cerebrovascular tone: autoregulation and neurovascular coupling. However, although the role of NO in the control of CBF has been largely investigated, the complexity of the NO system and the lack of specific NO synthase inhibitors led to still unresolved questions such as the origin of NO and the pathways by which it controls the vascular tone. In this chapter, the role of NO in the regulation of CBF is critically reviewed and discussed in the context of the neurovascular unit and the general principles of cerebrovascular regulation.

Recent developments have made use of biologically inspired architectures, such as the Convolutional Neural Network, and the Deep Belief Network. We test the hypothesis that generative models such as the Deep Belief Network should perform better on occluded object recognition tasks than purely discriminative models such as Convolutional Neural Networks. We find that the data does not support this hypothesis when the generative models are run in a partially discriminative manner. We also find that the use of Gaussian visible units in a Deep Belief Network trained on occluded image data allows it to also learn to classify non-occluded images.(1)	[Chu, Joseph Lin; Krzyzak, Adam] Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada	Chu, JL (reprint author), Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.	jo_chu@encs.concordia.ca; krzyzak@cs.concordia.ca						24	0	1	1	8	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-319-07172-5; 978-3-319-07173-2	LECT NOTES ARTIF INT			2014	8467						34	46				13	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BB1OW	WOS:000341246000004		No			2017-07-26

Physical controls on CH4 emissions from a newly flooded subtropical freshwater hydroelectric reservoir: Nam Theun 2	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							GAS TRANSFER VELOCITIES; METHANE EMISSIONS; TROPICAL RESERVOIR; EDDY COVARIANCE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; HYDROPOWER RESERVOIR; NORTHERN PEATLAND; FLUX MEASUREMENTS; NEURAL-NETWORK; EXCHANGE	In the present study, we measured independently CH4 ebullition and diffusion in the footprint of an eddy covariance system (EC) measuring CH4 emissions in the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir, a recently impounded (2008) subtropical hydroelectric reservoir located in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Southeast Asia. The EC fluxes were very consistent with the sum of the two terms measured independently (diffusive fluxes + ebullition=EC fluxes), indicating that the EC system picked up both diffusive fluxes and ebullition from the reservoir. We showed a diurnal bimodal pattern of CH4 emissions anti-correlated with atmospheric pressure. During daytime, a large atmospheric pressure drop triggers CH4 ebullition (up to 100 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), whereas at night, a more moderate peak of CH4 emissions was recorded. As a consequence, fluxes during daytime were twice as high as during nighttime. Additionally, more than 4800 discrete measurements of CH4 ebullition were performed at a weekly/fortnightly frequency, covering water depths ranging from 0.4 to 16m and various types of flooded ecosystems. Methane ebullition varies significantly seasonally and depends mostly on water level change during the warm dry season, whereas no relationship was observed during the cold dry season. On average, ebullition was 8.5 +/- 10.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and ranged from 0 to 201.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1). An artificial neural network (ANN) model could explain up to 46% of seasonal variability of ebullition by considering total static pressure (the sum of hydrostatic and atmospheric pressure), variations in the total static pressure, and bottom temperature as controlling factors. This model allowed extrapolation of CH4 ebullition on the reservoir scale and performance of gap filling over four years. Our results clearly showed a very high seasonality: 50% of the yearly CH4 ebullition occurs within four months of the warm dry season. Overall, ebullition contributed 60-80% of total emissions from the surface of the reservoir (disregarding downstream emissions), suggesting that ebullition is a major pathway in young hydroelectric reservoirs in the tropics.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of AD, including amyloidogenesis, disruption of calcium homeostasis, energetic failure, induction of oxidative stress, and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. This review examines associations between cellular and subcellular injuries, neurodegeneration, and cell death in experimental models, clinical symptoms, and autopsy reports of AD to identify the subcellular events leading to disease onset and progression. The order in which these events occur is discussed. The first injuries reported in AD are subcellular and occur at the Golgi apparatus before any beta-amyloid proteins deposit in the Golgi and endosomes. This is followed by lysosomal alterations and the inability of cells to clear beta-amyloid. The next stage reveals functional changes and modifications in hippocampal synaptic transmission before structural changes are observed at the cellular level. Subsequently, an extensive intracellular inflammatory process develops in neurons and astrocytes. This inflammatory reaction begins in the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes and mitochondria, and is thought to lead to neurodegeneration and cell death. Finally, the neuroinflammatory response of chronically activated microglia escalates the neurodegeneration and cell death. Identifying the detailed sequence of subcellular events induced by the primum movens defect in AD may lead to the identification of novel drug targets for the treatment of the disease.

Aims: The aim of the present study was to verify the influence of age, education, and gender on healthy adults' linguistic performance on the MTL-BR. Methods & Procedures: The sample consisted of 463 healthy adults recruited from cities in southern and southeastern Brazil, divided into groups according to gender, age (19-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-75 years), and education level (5-8, 9-11 and >12 years of formal schooling); the influence of all these variables on MTL-BR performance was assessed. Outcomes & Results: The results showed that education had the greatest influence on subtest scores. Few scores appeared to be influenced by age, and only minimal gender differences were identified. Conclusions: The data obtained will contribute to the clinical assessment of patients with aphasia throughout Brazil.

This study reports third-person attitudes towards several salient issues on locked-in syndrome. Methods: Close-ended survey among conference attendees from 33 European countries. Analysis included chi-square tests and logistic regressions. Results: From the 3332 respondents (33% physicians, 18% other clinicians, 49% other professions; 47% religious), 90% agreed that patients with locked-in syndrome can feel pain. The majority (75%) disagreed with treatment withdrawal, but 56% did not wish to be kept alive if they imagined themselves in this condition (p<0.001). Religious and southern Europeans opposed to treatment withdrawal more often than non-religious (p<0.001) and participants from the North (p 0.001). When the locked-in syndrome was compared to disorders of consciousness, more respondents endorsed that being in a chronic locked-in syndrome was worse than being in a vegetative state or minimally conscious state for patients (59%) than they thought for families (40%, p<0.001). Conclusions: Personal characteristics mediate opinions about locked-in syndrome. The dissociation between personal preferences and general opinions underlie the difference in perspective in disability. Ethical responses to dilemmas involving patients with locked-in syndrome should consider the diverging ethical attitudes of stakeholders.

Research design: Data were retrospectively collected on individuals (n = 5642) admitted to the Traumatic Brain Injury Program of the MUHC-MGH. Methods and procedures: Outcome measures used were length of stay (LOS), the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM (R)). Main outcomes: The overall rate of patients leaving AMA was 1.9% (n = 108). Age was negatively associated with AMA discharge (95% CI OR = [0.966;0.991]). Patients with a history of substance abuse were similar to 2-times more likely to leave AMA than those not using substances before injury (95% CI OR = [1.172;3.314]) and the homeless were similar to 3-times more likely to leave AMA compared to those who were not homeless (95% CI OR = [1.260;7.138]). Length of stay (LOS) was shorter for patients leaving AMA (p<0.001) and they showed better outcome (GOSE: p<0.001; FIM (R) : p = 0.032). Conclusions: Knowing the profile of patients with TBI leaving AMA hospitalized in an urban Level 1 Trauma centre will help in the development of effective strategies based on patient needs, values and pre-injury psychosocial situation to encourage them to complete their treatment course in hospital.

MILE is often associated with a typical pattern of brain damage known as mesial temporal sclerosis, and it is one of the most refractory forms of partial epilepsy in adults. Specifically, we will address the cellular and pharmacological features of abnormal electrographic events that, as in MILE patients, can occur in in vivo and in vitro animal models; these include interictal and ictal discharges along with high-frequency oscillations. In addition, we will consider how different limbic structures made hyperexcitable by acute pharmacological manipulations interact during epileptiform discharge generation. We will also review the electrographic characteristics of two types of seizure onsets that are most commonly seen in human and experimental MTLE as well as in in vitro models of epileptiform synchronization. Finally, we will address the role played by neurosteroids in reducing epileptiform synchronization and in modulating epileptogenesis.

Biological differences between melancholic and nonmelancholic depression subtyped by the CORE measure	NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT			English	Article						melancholic depression; oxidative stress; inflammatory cytokines; brain-derived neurotrophic factor	ANTIOXIDATIVE ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; MAJOR DEPRESSION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DEFINING MELANCHOLIA; PSYCHOMOTOR DISTURBANCE; CLASSIFYING DEPRESSION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; CYTOKINES	Background: The purpose of this study was to compare melancholic patients rated by the CORE measure of observable psychomotor disturbance with nonmelancholic and control subjects across a set of biomarkers. Methods: Depressed patients were classified as melancholic or nonmelancholic by using the CORE measure. Both groups of patients, as well as control subjects, were compared for a set of clinical and laboratory measures. Serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, of two markers of oxidative stress (protein carbonyl content [PCC] and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS]), and of several immunity markers (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma) were analyzed. Results: Thirty-three depressed patients and 54 healthy controls were studied. Depressive patients showed higher IL-4, IL-6, and PCC values than healthy controls. Thirteen (39%) of the depressed patients were assigned as melancholic by the CORE measure. They generated lower interferon-gamma (compared with nonmelancholic depressed patients) and TBARS (compared with both the nonmelancholic subset and controls) and returned higher IL-6 levels than controls. Both depressive groups generated higher PCC scores than controls, with no difference between melancholic and nonmelancholic subsets. Conclusion: A sign-based measure to rate melancholia was able to replicate and extend biological findings discriminating melancholic depression. Signs of psychomotor disturbance may be a useful diagnostic measure of melancholia.

Left heart disease: a frequent cause of early pulmonary hypertension in systemic sclerosis, unrelated to elevated NT-proBNP levels or overt cardiac fibrosis but associated with increased levels of MR-proANP and MR-proADM: retrospective analysis of a French Canadian cohort	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article							BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CONNECTIVE-TISSUE DISEASE; ARTERIAL-HYPERTENSION; DOPPLER-ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; DIAGNOSTIC METHODOLOGIES; MYOCARDIAL FIBROSIS; PREDICTIVE FACTORS; PREVALENCE; SURVIVAL	Objectives: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) causes mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and left heart disease (LHD) are frequent causes of PH. Therefore, we studied PAH and LHD in early PH. Method: A total of 432 French Canadian SSc patients were studied retrospectively. All underwent screening for PH. We analysed clinical, serological, and radiographic data from 26 patients with early PH diagnosed by right heart catheterization (RHC). SSc patients with (n = 21) and without PH (n = 19) were prospectively re-evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and serial measurements of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and the haemodynamic biomarkers mid-regional pro-atrial natriuritic peptide (MR-proANP) and mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM). Results: The most frequent cause of early PH was LHD (58%). PAH was seen in 34% of patients. No association was found between the type of PH and autoantibodies. Early LHD-PH, but not early PAH, was associated with lower NT-proBNP (p = 0.024), but MR-proANP and MR-proADM levels were higher in early LHD-PH than in patients without PH (p = 0.014 and p = 0.012, respectively). Only one patient had abnormal cardiac MRI explaining LHD-PH. Conclusions: Early PH in SSc, like late PH, is heterogeneous and RHC is essential for determining its underlying cause. The most frequent cause of early PH was LHD. Levels of MR-proANP and MR-proADM, but not NT-proBNP, were increased in early LHD-PH, and may be more reliable than NT-proBNP as a biomarker of early PH in this subgroup of patients. Cardiac MRI did not explain LHD-PH. This study is the first to identify a high frequency of LHD in early PH correlating with normal NT-proBNP levels but increased MR-proANP and MR-proADM levels in SSc patients.

The MoCA was administered to 214 patients with TBI during their acute care hospitalization in a Level 1 trauma center. The results showed that patients with severe TBI had lower scores on the MoCA compared with patients with mild and moderate TBI, F(2, 211) 10.35, p=.0001. This difference was found for visuospatial/executive, attention, and orientation subtests (p<.05). Linear regression demonstrated that age, education, TBI severity, and the presence of neurological antecedents were the best predictors of cognitive impairments explaining 42% of the total variability of the MoCA. This information can enable clinicians to predict early cognitive impairments and plan cognitive rehabilitation earlier in the recovery process.

Our objectives were to describe patterns and predictors of PR use. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of analgosedation, antipsychotic, neuromuscular blocker, and PR practices in 51 Canadian ICUs. Data were collected prospectively for all mechanically ventilated adults admitted during a two-week period. We tested for patient, treatment, and hospital characteristics that were associated with PR use and number of days of use, using logistic and Poisson regression respectively. Results: PR was used on 374 out of 711 (53%) patients, for a mean number of 4.1 (standard deviation (SD) 4.0) days. Treatment characteristics associated with PR were higher daily benzodiazepine dose (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.11), higher daily opioid dose (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06), antipsychotic drugs (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.74 to 5.48), agitation (Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) > 4) (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.50 to 9.29), and sedation administration method (continuous and bolus versus bolus only) (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.74 to 5.48). Hospital characteristics associated with PR indicated patients were less likely to be restrained in ICUs from university-affiliated hospitals (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.61). Mainly treatment characteristics were associated with more days of PR, including: higher daily benzodiazepine dose (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13), daily sedation interruption (IRR 3.44, 95% CI 1.48 to 8.10), antipsychotic drugs (IRR 15.67, 95% CI 6.62 to 37.12), SAS < 3 (IRR 2.62, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.35), and any adverse event including accidental device removal (IRR 8.27, 95% CI 2.07 to 33.08). Patient characteristics (age, gender, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, admission category, prior substance abuse, prior psychotropic medication, pre-existing psychiatric condition or dementia) were not associated with PR use or number of days used. Conclusions: PR was used in half of the patients in these 51 ICUs. Treatment characteristics predominantly predicted PR use, as opposed to patient or hospital/ICU characteristics. Use of sedative, analgesic, and antipsychotic drugs, agitation, heavy sedation, and occurrence of an adverse event predicted PR use or number of days used.

Fortunately, technical limitations that have constrained this research have recently been mitigated by advances in research tools that facilitate circuit-based analyses. The most prominent of these tools is optogenetics, which refers to the use of genetically encoded, light-sensitive proteins that can be used to manipulate discrete neural circuits with temporal precision. Optogenetics has recently been used to examine the neural underpinnings of both psychiatric disease and symptom relief, and this research has rapidly identified novel therapeutic targets for what could be a new generation of rational drug development. As these and related methodologies for controlling neurons ultimately make their way into the clinic, circuit-based strategies for alleviating psychiatric symptoms could become a remarkably refined approach to disease treatment.

Its genetic mutations lead to a severe disorder known as chylomicron retention disease. Despite growing knowledge on Sarlb, little is known about it tissue distribution and regulation, which constitute the aims of the present study. We aimed to determine the Sar1b tissue distribution and modulation by a high-fat diet and gene forcing using transgenic mice in comparison to wild type mice. Methods: The expression pattern of Sar1b was studied in different organs of wild type and Sur1b transgenic mice by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The effect of transgenesis and insulin resistance induced by a 12 week high fat diet on Sarlb gene expression was also assessed by qRT-PCR. Results: Evaluation of Sarlb mRNA revealed the skeletal muscle as the tissue with the highest Sarlb expression, followed by the heart and liver, the organs composing the digestive tract, the brain and finally the lung and the adipose tissue. Sarlb protein expression levels follow a similar pattern among the organs, except for its lower expression in the heart. While the high-fat diet did not exert any significant alterations, Sar1b transgenic mice displayed higher gene expression in the liver, ileum, jejunum, proximal and distal colon compared to wild type mice. Conclusion: Our study supports the importance of Sarlb in organs involved in lipid transport and/or calcium trafficking such as the liver, intestine, skeletal muscle and heart. Copyright (C) 2014 S.

After a complete spinal injury, cats re-express hindlimb locomotion after 2-3 weeks because of a spinal locomotor circuitry named the central pattern generator or CPG. To investigate whether such circuits are also implicated in the recovery of locomotion after partial spinal lesions, we have used a dual spinal lesion paradigm. Essentially, after an initial unilateral hemisection, cats spontaneously recover quadrupedal locomotion. When a complete section is then performed 3 weeks after this hemisection, cats can walk with the hindlimbs within 24 hours compared to 2-3 weeks in cats with single complete spinal lesions demonstrating the importance of spinal mechanisms after partial lesions. Using kinematic and electromyographic methods to evaluate the changes throughout the dual lesion paradigm, we could show that the spinal cord reorganizes spontaneously without locomotor training or with training provided between the partial and complete spinal lesion. To assess spinal lesions we have used histology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We will describe some advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion and magnetization transfer, which provide higher specificity to axon degeneration and demyelination. Examples of advanced MRI techniques in cats and humans are described, including the current limitations and perspectives.

Its subtle morphological changes often predicate illnesses, including Alzheimer's, schizophrenia or epilepsy. The precise location of structural differences requires a reliable correspondence between shapes across a population. In this paper, we propose an automated method for groupwise hippocampal shape analysis based on a spectral decomposition of a group of shapes to solve the correspondence problem between sets of meshes. The framework generates diffeomorphic correspondence maps across a population, which enables us to create a mean shape. Morphological changes are then located between two groups of subjects. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of 42 hippocampus shapes and compared with a state-of-the-art structural shape analysis approach, using spherical harmonics. Difference maps between mean shapes of two test groups demonstrates that the two approaches showed results with insignificant differences, while Gaussian curvature measures calculated between matched vertices showed a better fit and reduced variability with spectral matching.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to search for reliability and validity evidence for the Montreal-Toulouse Language Assessment Battery (MTL-BR). METHODS: The sample was composed of 537 adults, of whom 463 were healthy individuals and 74 had neurological lesions (25 participants had right hemisphere brain damage, 21 had left hemisphere damage (LHD) with aphasia and 28 had LHD without aphasia). Reliability was assessed by internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and test-retest analyses. Test-retest reliability was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient, and a repeated measures analysis of variance, with years of education as a covariate. Construct validity was verified by correlations between scores in MTL-BR subtest and similar tasks from other language assessment instruments. RESULTS: Internal consistency was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha between 0.79 and 0.90), as were correlations between test and retest scores (mean 0.52), and between the MTL-BR and scores in similar instruments. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggested that the MTL-BR battery had adequate reliability and validity as a method for diagnosing and monitoring aphasia.

Performance of the linear and non-linear downscaling models was evaluated using four different sets of predictors, not only in terms of their ability to reproduce the magnitude of day-to-day variability (i.e., "weather," mean absolute error between the daily values of the predictand(s) and the downscaled data) but also in terms of their ability to reproduce longer time scale variability (i.e., "climate," indices of agreement between the predictand's observed annual climate indices and the corresponding downscaled values). The climate indices used were the 90th percentile of the daily maximum temperature, 10th percentile of the daily minimum temperature, number of frost days, heat wave duration, growing season length, and intra-annual temperature range. Our results show that the non-linear models usually outperform their linear counterparts in the magnitude of daily variability and, to a greater extent, in annual climate variability. In particular, the best model simulating weather and climate was a BNN ensemble using stepwise selection from 20 reanalysis predictors, followed by a BNN ensemble using the three leading principal components from the aforementioned predictors. Finally, we showed that, on average, the first three indices presented higher skills than the growing season length, number of frost days, and the heat wave duration.	[Gaitan, C. F.; Hsieh, W.

Data collected from a web-based survey of German university students were used in our analysis. Moral acceptability of cognitive enhancers was relatively low and moderate for academic misconduct. The correlation between these measures was moderately weak. The use frequency of cognitive enhancers was lower than for academic misconduct and was (very) lightly correlated with the occurrences of reported plagiarism and fabrication/falsification. A higher acceptability of each act was associated with a higher use frequency of each act.

Glaucoma rarely causes symptoms until the later stages of the disease. Early detection of glaucoma is very important to prevent visual loss since optic nerve damages cannot be reversed. To detect glaucoma, purely data-driven techniques have advantages, especially when the disease characteristics are complex and when precise image-based measurements are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we present our preliminary study for glaucoma detection using an automatic method based on local texture features extracted from fundus photographs. It implements the completed modeling of Local Binary Patterns to capture representative texture features from the whole image. A local region is represented by three operators: its central pixel (LBPC) and its local differences as two complementary components, the sign (which is the classical LBP) and the magnitude (LBPM). An image texture is finally described by both the distribution of LBP and the joint-distribution of LBPM and LBPC. Our images are then classified using a nearest-neighbor method with a leave-one-out validation strategy. On a sample set of 41 fundus images (13 glaucomatous, 28 non-glaucomatous), our method achieves 95.1 % success rate with a specificity of 92.3 % and a sensitivity of 96.4 %. This study proposes a reproducible glaucoma detection process that could be used in a low-priced medical screening, thus avoiding the inter-experts variability issue.

Stability of intraindividual variability as a marker of neurologic dysfunction in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; Cognition; Attention Network Test; Longitudinal; Information processing speed; Intraindividual variability	REACTION-TIME VARIABILITY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PROCESSING SPEED; INCONSISTENCY; ISOLABILITY; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; ROBUSTNESS; COMPONENTS; FATIGUE	Background: Impairments in information processing speed are common in multiple sclerosis (MS), with affected individuals demonstrating slower responses and more intraindividual variability (IIV) in their performance on timed tasks. Evidence suggesting that IIV provides novel information about cognitive deficits in MS is accumulating; however, little is known about the stability of IIV across multiple assessments. In this study, we investigated IIV in response speed in persons with MS across 6 monthly sessions using the Attention Network Test-Interaction (ANT-I). Method: Individuals with relatively mild relapsing remitting MS and healthy controls completed the ANT-I at 6 monthly intervals. Clinical assessments (Sessions 1 and 6) and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies (Sessions 1-6) were examined for individuals with MS. Results: The MS group's clinical and neuroimaging measures were stable during the 6-month period. Individuals with MS were slower and more variable in reaction time performance on the ANT-I than were controls. Differences in IIV between groups were maintained across the 6 sessions, with IIV demonstrating less susceptibility to across-session practice effects than mean latency scores. Conclusions: IIV provides a stable measure of cognitive performance in mildly affected persons with MS who are clinically and radiologically stable. Further studies exploring its utility as a clinical outcome are warranted.

The genome-wide landscape of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in response to sleep deprivation impacts on synaptic plasticity genes	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						cortical synchrony; DNA methylation and hydroxylation; sleep need; transcription	EPIGENETIC REGULATION; SOCIAL-ENVIRONMENT; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; MEMORY FORMATION; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; HOMEOSTASIS; DISORDERS; 5-HYDROXYMETHYLCYTOSINE; NEUROLIGIN-1	Sleep is critical for normal brain function and mental health. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of sleep loss on both cognition and the sleep electroencephalogram remain mostly unknown. Acute sleep loss impacts brain gene expression broadly. These data contributed to current hypotheses regarding the role for sleep in metabolism, synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. These changes in gene expression likely underlie increased sleep intensity following sleep deprivation (SD). Here we tested the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms coordinate the gene expression response driven by SD. We found that SD altered the cortical genome-wide distribution of two major epigenetic marks: DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in gene pathways involved in neuritogenesis and synaptic plasticity, whereas large changes (>4000 sites) in hydroxymethylation where observed in genes linked to cytoskeleton, signaling and neurotransmission, which closely matches SD-dependent changes in the transcriptome. Moreover, this epigenetic remodeling applied to elements previously linked to sleep need (for example, Arc and Egr1) and synaptic partners of Neuroligin-1 (Nlgn1; for example, Dlg4, Nrxn1 and Nlgn3), which we recently identified as a regulator of sleep intensity following SD. We show here that Nlgn1 mutant mice display an enhanced slow-wave slope during non-rapid eye movement sleep following SD but this mutation does not affect SD-dependent changes in gene expression, suggesting that the Nlgn pathway acts downstream to mechanisms triggering gene expression changes in SD. These data reveal that acute SD reprograms the epigenetic landscape, providing a unique molecular route by which sleep can impact brain function and health.

The notion of an "association field" proposes that neurons interact to extract extended contours. Here, we identify the site and properties of contour integration mechanisms. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and population receptive field (pRF) analyses. We devised pRF mapping stimuli consisting of contours. We isolated the contribution of contour integration mechanisms to the pRF by manipulating the contour content. This stimulus manipulation led to systematic changes in pRF size. Whereas a bank of Gabor filters quantitatively explains pRF size changes in V1, only V2/V3 pRF sizes match the predictions of the association field. pRF size changes in later visual field maps, hV4, LO-1, and LO-2 do not follow either prediction and are probably driven by distinct classical receptive field properties or other extraclassical integration mechanisms. These pRF changes do not follow conventional fMRI signal strength measures. Therefore, analyses of pRF changes provide a novel computational neuroimaging approach to investigating neural interactions. We interpreted these results as evidence for neural interactions along co-oriented, cocircular receptive fields in the early extrastriate visual cortex (V2/V3), consistent with the notion of a contour association field.

J	Yoonessi, A; Baker, CL				Yoonessi, Ahmad; Baker, Curtis L., Jr.			Boundary segmentation from dynamic occlusion-based motion parallax	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						motion parallax; segmentation; cue combination; dynamic occlusion	DEPTH-PERCEPTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; AREA MT; RELATIVE MOTION; SELF-MOTION; NEURONS; MACAQUE; CUE; FLOW; MECHANISMS	Active observer movement results in retinal image motion that is highly dependent on the scene layout. This retinal motion, often called motion parallax, can yield significant information about the boundaries between objects and their relative depth differences. Previously we examined segmentation from shear-based motion parallax, which consists of only relative motion information. Here, we examine segmentation from dynamic occlusion-based motion parallax, which contains both relative motion and accretion-deletion. We utilized random dots whose motion was modulated with vertical low spatial frequency envelopes and synchronized to head movements (Head Sync), or recreated using previously recorded head movement data for the same stationary observer (Playback). Observers judged the orientation of a boundary between regions of oppositely moving dots in a 2AFC task. The results demonstrate that observers perform poorer when the stimulus motion is synchronized to head movement, particularly at smaller relative depths, even though that head movement provides significant information about depth. Both expansion-compression and accretion-deletion in isolation could support segmentation, albeit with reduced performance. Therefore, unlike our previous results for depth ordering, expansion-compression and accretion-deletion contribute similarly to segmentation. Furthermore, human observers do not appear to utilize depth information to improve segmentation performance.

However, the central nervous system (CNS) changes that occur in as a result of this therapy are largely unknown. Objective: To examine the effects of FES on the restoration of voluntary locomotor function of the CNS in a SCI rat model. Methods: SCI rats were instrumented with chronic FES electrodes in the hindlimb muscles and were divided into two groups: (a) FES therapy and (b) sedentary. At day 7 post-SCI, the animals were assessed for locomotion performance by using a Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale. They were then anesthetized for a terminal in vivo experiment. The lumbar spinal cord and somatosensory cortex were exposed and the instrumented muscles were stimulated electrically. Associated neurovascular responses in the CNS were recorded with an intrinsic optical imaging system. Results: FES greatly improved locomotion recovery by day 7 post-SCI, as measured by BBB scores (P < 0.05): (a) FES 10 +/- 2 and (b) controls 3 +/- 1. Furthermore, the FES group showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) of neurovascular activation in the spinal cord and somatosensory cortex when the muscles were stimulated between 1 and 3 motor threshold (MT). Conclusion: Hind limb rehabilitation with FES is an effective strategy to improve locomotion during the acute phase post-SCI. The results of this study indicate that after FES, the CNS preserves/acquires the capacity to respond to peripheral electrical stimulation.

HIP Consortium	Management of Hypotension in Preterm Infants (The HIP Trial): A Randomised Controlled Trial of Hypotension Management in Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns	NEONATOLOGY			English	Article						Survey; Hypotension; Diagnosis; Treatment; Extremely low gestational age; Newborn	BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; ARTERIAL-BLOOD-PRESSURE; PREMATURE-INFANTS; INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGE; MECHANICAL VENTILATION; CARDIAC-OUTPUT; 1ST DAY; LIFE; FLOW; BABIES	Background: Extremely preterm babies (delivered at <28 completed weeks of gestation) are frequently diagnosed with hypotension and treated with inotropic and pressor drugs in the immediate postnatal period. Dopamine is the most commonly used first-line drug. Babies who are treated for hypotension more frequently sustain brain injury, have long-term disability or die compared to those who are not. Despite the widespread use of drugs to treat hypotension in such infants, evidence for efficacy is lacking, and the effect of these agents on long-term outcomes is unknown. Hypothesis: In extremely preterm babies, restricting the use of dopamine when mean blood pressure (BP) values fall below a nominal threshold and using clinical criteria to determine escalation of support ('restricted' approach) will result in improved neonatal and longer-term developmental outcomes. Research Plan: In an international multi-centre randomised trial, 830 infants born at <28 weeks of gestation, and within 72 h of birth, will be allocated to 1 of 2 alternative treatment options (dopamine vs. restricted approach) to determine the better strategy for the management of BP, using a conventional threshold to commence treatment. The first co-primary outcome of survival without brain injury will be determined at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age and the second co-primary outcome (survival without neurodevelopmental disability) will be assessed at 2 years of age, corrected for prematurity. Discussion: It is essential that appropriately designed trials be performed to define the most appropriate management strategies for managing low BP in extremely preterm babies. (c) 2014 S.

The main goal of this study was to examine how conversational discourse impairment following TBI predicts early outcome. Factors which influence conversational discourse performance were also explored. Methods: The conversational discourse checklist of the Protocole Montreal d'evaluation de la communication (D-MEC) was administered in an acute tertiary care trauma centre to 195 adults within 3 weeks post-TBI. Outcome was measured with the Disability Rating Scale (DRS), the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) and included discharge destinations from acute care. Main outcomes and results: Linear regression results showed that the D-MEC total score, age and initial GCS score accounted for 50% of the variation of the DRS scores. The DRS score was lower, signifying better outcome, when the total D-MEC score was higher, the subject was younger and when the initial GCS score was higher. Moreover, D-MEC performance significantly predicted the moderate and severe disability categories of the GOS-E and the probability of requiring rehabilitation (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results provide additional information to guide healthcare professionals in predicting overall outcome acutely post-TBI.

One example of such order is the myotopic organisation of the motor system where spinal motor neuron position parallels that of target muscles. This chapter will discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying motor neuron soma positioning, which include transcriptional control of Reelin signaling and cadherin expression. As the same transcription factors have been shown to control motor axon innervation of target muscles, a simple mechanism of topographic organisation specification is becoming evident raising the question of how coordinating soma position with axon trajectory might be important for nervous system wiring and its function.

The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), given as single modalities or sequentially, is still unclear. Furthermore, insight into the predictive and prognostic impact of various biomarkers is surging. Objectives To compare postoperative sequential RT and chemotherapy to RT alone in adults with newly diagnosed AO or mixed AOA. To evaluate the predictive and prognostic impact of the following biomarkers: codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promotor methylation and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-1 and -2 mutations. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, 2014), MEDLINE (2006 to March week 2, 2014) and EMBASE (2006 to week 11, 2014). We scanned reference lists from relevant studies for any additional articles. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with AO, AOA or anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) comparing adjuvant treatment of chemotherapy, RT, or sequential chemotherapy and RT. We excluded no specific chemotherapy regimens. Data collection and analysis We critically appraised and extracted data from relevant studies. Based on the differences in participant selection with respect to the definition of AO(two versus three high-risk anaplastic features), the inclusion of AA and sequence of treatment (RT and chemotherapy), we could not consider the results from the three RCTs for meta-analysis. Main results Three RCTs, with 931 participants, tested different neoadjuvant treatments: RT alone; sequential RT and procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy; PCV chemotherapy alone; and temozolomide chemotherapy alone. None of the studies blinded participants or personnel, and, therefore, are considered at high risk of performance and detection bias. The studies were otherwise at low risk of bias. One study, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial, demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit for RT plus PCV, with a median OS of 3.5 years compared with 2.6 years in the RT alone arm (P value = 0.018). This result was reported 10 years after the conclusion of the enrolment, and was not apparent in the original 2008 Cochrane review. Furthermore, with retrospective evaluation of biomarkers, codeletion of complete chromosome arms 1p and 19q and IDH-1 or -2 mutation were independent prognostic factors for OS in two of the RCTs (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and EORTC), and were predictive for OS in one trial (RTOG). The third trial (NOA-04) evaluated these biomarkers prospectively and found them prognostic for progression-free survival. Authors' conclusions Early PCV, either before or after RT, appears to improve OS of participants with AO or AOA. Use of biomarkers including codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q with or without IDH-1 or -2 mutation identify a subset of people with increased sensitivity to combined PCV and RT. The important role of biomarkers was supported in all of the RCTs examined, and prospective evaluation should be undertaken in future studies. However, PCV was associated with significant grade 3 and 4 toxicities, and whether temozolomide can be substituted for this remains unclear.

However, inducing gait-like cyclical movements and illusions requires the application of multiple fast alternating vibrations to lower-limb muscles. The objectives were (1) to test the feasibility of delivering complex vibrations in a time-organized manner and (2) to illustrate the possibility of inducing alternate gait-in-place-like movements using these vibrations. Patterns of vibration, produced by 12 vibrators applied bilaterally on the flexor and extensor muscle groups of the lower limbs, were based on normal gait kinematics. We tested 1 s and 2 s cycle patterns of vibration. Vibrator responses were assessed using auto-and crosscorrelations and frequency analyses based on accelerometry measurements, and compared between patterns. High auto-(>0.8) and cross-correlation (>0.6) coefficients demonstrated a good response by the vibrators to the control signal. Vibrations induced cyclical, low-amplitude stepping-in-place movements that mimicked alternate walking movements with both legs, with 1 s and 2 s cycle durations, in one nondisabled participant and one participant with American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale B spinal cord injury standing, relaxed, with body-weight support. Electromechanical vibrators can deliver complex cyclical vibrations and trigger gait-like lower-limb movements. These results warrant the application of these vibration patterns on individuals with sensorimotor impairments to test their potential in gait rehabilitation.

BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE RESERVE; BILINGUALISM DELAYS; OLDER-ADULTS; EDUCATION; BRAIN; RISK; MULTILINGUALISM; PREVALENCE; OCCUPATION	There is an emerging literature suggesting that speaking two or more languages may significantly delay the onset of dementia. Although the mechanisms are unknown, it has been suggested that these may involve cognitive reserve, a concept that has been associated with factors such as higher levels of education, occupational status, social networks, and physical exercise. In the case of bilingualism, cognitive reserve may involve reorganization and strengthening of neural networks that enhance executive control. We review evidence for protective effects of bilingualism from a multicultural perspective involving studies in Toronto and Montreal, Canada, and Hyderabad, India. Reports from Toronto and Hyderabad showed a significant effect of speaking two or more languages in delaying onset of Alzheimer's disease by up to 5 years, whereas the Montreal study showed a significant protective effect of speaking at least four languages and a protective effect of speaking at least two languages in immigrants. Although there were differences in results across studies, a common theme was the significant effect of language use history as one of the factors in determining the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

J	Comai, S; Gobbi, G				Comai, Stefano; Gobbi, Gabriella			Unveiling the role of melatonin MT2 receptors in sleep, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric diseases: a novel target in psychopharmacology	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NUCLEUS-RETICULARIS THALAMI; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; ADULT HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; PROLONGED-RELEASE MELATONIN; FASTING GLUCOSE-LEVELS; TYPE-2 DIABETES RISK; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS	Background: Melatonin (MLT) is a pleiotropic neurohormone controlling many physiological processes and whose dysfunction may contribute to several different diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, circadian and mood disorders, insomnia, type 2 diabetes and pain. Melatonin is synthesized by the pineal gland during the night and acts through 2 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), MT1 (MEL1a) and MT2 (MEL1b). Although a bulk of research has examined the physiopathological effects of MLT, few studies have investigated the selective role played by MT1 and MT2 receptors. Here we have reviewed current knowledge about the implications of MT2 receptors in brain functions. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and articles reference lists for studies on MT2 receptor ligands in sleep, anxiety, neuropsychiatric diseases and psychopharmacology, including genetic studies on the MTNR1B gene, which encodes the melatonin MT2 receptor. Results: These studies demonstrate that MT2 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology and pharmacology of sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer disease and pain and that selective MT2 receptor agonists show hypnotic and anxiolytic properties. Limitations: Studies examining the role of MT2 receptors in psychopharmacology are still limited. Conclusion: The development of novel selective MT2 receptor ligands, together with further preclinical in vivo studies, may clarify the role of this receptor in brain function and psychopharmacology. The superfamily of GPCRs has proven to be among the most successful drug targets and, consequently, MT2 receptors have great potential for pioneer drug discovery in the treatment of mental diseases for which limited therapeutic targets are currently available.

Patient-Reported Neuropathy and Taxane-Associated Symptoms in a Phase 3 Trial of nab-Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin versus Solvent-Based Paclitaxel Plus Carboplatin for Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer	JOURNAL OF THORACIC ONCOLOGY			English	Article						nab-Paclitaxel; Solvent-based paclitaxel; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane; Non-small-cell lung cancer; Peripheral neuropathy	METASTATIC BREAST-CANCER; ALBUMIN-BOUND PACLITAXEL; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; 1ST-LINE THERAPY; FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT; III TRIAL; CHEMOTHERAPY; DOCETAXEL; EVERY-3-WEEK; COMBINATION	Introduction:nab-Paclitaxel (nab-P) is approved, in the United States, in combination with carboplatin for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, based on a randomized phase 3 trial of nab-P plus carboplatin (nab-P/C) versus solvent-based paclitaxel plus carboplatin (sb-P/C). This trial revealed a higher overall response rate (33% versus 25%; p = 0.005) and longer, but not statistically significant, overall and progression-free survival for nab-P/C versus sb-P/C. In addition, nab-P/C demonstrated lower rates of grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy, myalgia, arthralgia, and neutropenia but higher rates of anemia and thrombocytopenia. This report analyzes patient and physician assessment of symptoms within this trial. Methods: Patients completed the taxane subscale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy questionnaire, which focuses on taxane toxicity, including peripheral neuropathy and neurotoxicity. Mean baseline scores and changes from baseline are reported. Physicians also graded the severity of neuropathy at each patient visit using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. Results: Patients receiving nab-P/C reported significantly less worsening of peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.001), pain (p < 0.001), and hearing loss (p = 0.002). Patient-reported edema was similar between the two treatment arms. In agreement with patient-reported symptoms, the results of a per-treatment cycle physician assessment of peripheral neuropathy also favored nab-P/C over sb-P/C (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In this trial of patients receiving first-line treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, nab-P/C was associated with statistically and clinically significant reductions in patient-reported neuropathy, neuropathic pain in the hands and feet, and hearing loss compared with sb-P/C.

Impact of Hemodialysis on Dyspnea and Lung Function in End Stage Kidney Disease Patients	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							CHRONIC-RENAL-FAILURE; RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH; OCCLUSION PRESSURE; BREATHING PATTERNS; PULMONARY-FUNCTION; CHRONIC DIALYSIS; CHRONIC UREMIA; SYMPTOMS; STANDARDIZATION; VENTILATION	Background. Respiratory symptoms are usually underestimated in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Therefore, we set out to investigate the prevalence of patients chronic dyspnea and the relationship of the symptom to lung function indices. Methods. Twenty-five clinically stable hemodialysis patients were included. The mMRC dyspnea scale was applied before and after hemodialysis. Spirometry, single breath nitrogen test, arterial blood gases, static maximum inspiratory (P-i max) and expiratory (P-e max) muscle pressures, and mouth occlusion pressure (P-0.1) were also measured. Results. Despite normal spirometry, all patients (100%) reported mild to moderate degree of chronic dyspnea pre which was reduced after hemodialysis. The sole predictor of (Delta) mMRCwas the (Delta) P-0.1 (r = 0.71, P < 0.001). The P-i max was reduced before and correlated with the duration of hemodialysis (r = 0.614, P < 0.001), whilst after the session it was significantly increased (P < 0.001). Finally (Delta) weight was correlated with the (Delta) P-i max % pred (r = 0.533, P = 0, 006) and with the (Delta) CV (% pred) (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). Conclusion. We conclude that dyspnea is the major symptom among the CKD patients that improves after hemodialysis. The neuromechanical dissociation observed probably is one of the major pathophysiologic mechanisms of dyspnea.

Resting state executive control network (RS-ECN) represents a novel approach to interrogate the integrity of brain areas underlying executive dysfunction. The present study aims to investigate RS-ECN in aMCI and examine a possible link between changes in brain functional connectivity and declines in executive function. aMCI individuals (n = 13) and healthy subjects (n = 16) underwent cognitive assessment including executive function and high field functional magnetic resonance imaging. Individual RS-ECN maps were estimated using a seed-based cross-correlation method. Between groups RS-ECN functional connectivity comparison was assessed using voxel-wise statistic parametric mapping. aMCI individuals had reduced RS-ECN connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilaterally. In contrast, aMCI showed increased connectivity in ventral lateral and anterior prefrontal cortex, bilaterally. Connectivity strength was associated with executive function in the ACC (r = 0.6213, p = 0.023) and right DLPFC (r = 0.6454, p = 0.017). Coexistence between connectivity declines and recruitment of brain regions outside the RS-ECN as reported here fits a brain reserve conceptual framework in which brain networks undergo remodeling in aMCI individuals.

However, little is known about how mechanical strain induces these changes. This study investigated the cellular and molecular changes as well as which inflammatory receptors and cytokines were upregulated in human intervertebral disc cells exposed to high mechanical strain (HMS) at low frequency. The impact of these metabolic changes on neuronal differentiation was also explored to determine a role in the development of disc degeneration and discogenic pain. Methods: Isolated human annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were exposed to HMS (20% cyclical stretch at 0.001 Hz) on high-extension silicone rubber dishes coupled to a mechanical stretching apparatus and compared to static control cultures. Gene expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), neuronal growth factor (NGF) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was assessed. Collected conditioned media were analysed for cytokine content and applied to rat pheocromocytoma PC12 cells for neuronal differentiation assessment. Results: HMS caused upregulation of TLR2, TLR4, NGF and TNF alpha gene expression in IVD cells. Medium from HMS cultures contained elevated levels of growth-related oncogene, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), MCP-3, monokine induced by. interferon, transforming growth factor beta 1, TNF alpha and NGF. Exposure of PC12 cells to HMS-conditioned media resulted in both increased neurite sprouting and cell death. Conclusions: HMS culture of IVD cells in vitro drives cytokine and inflammatory responses associated with degenerative disc disease and low-back pain. This study provides evidence for a direct link between cellular strain, secretory factors, neoinnervation and potential degeneration and discogenic pain in vivo.

Procedures included identification of chemicals and modeling to predict the mode of exclusion; induction and control of spasticity in the ABH mouse model of multiple sclerosis; conditional deletion of CB1 receptor in peripheral nerves; side-effect profiling to demonstrate the mechanism of CNS-exclusion via drug pumps; genome-wide association study in N2(129xABH) backcross to map polymorphic cannabinoid drug pump; and sequencing and detection of cannabinoid drug-pump activity in human brain endothelial cell lines. Three drugs (CT3, SAB378 and SAD448) were identified that control spasticity via action on the peripheral nerve CB1 receptor. These were peripherally restricted via drug pumps that limit the CNS side effects (hypothermia) of cannabinoids to increase the therapeutic window. A cannabinoid drug pump is polymorphic and functionally lacking in many laboratory (C57BL/6, 129, CD-1) mice used for transgenesis, pharmacology, and toxicology studies. This phenotype was mapped and controlled by 1-3 genetic loci. ABCC1 within a cluster showing linkage is a cannabinoid CNS-drug pump. Global and conditional CB1 receptor-knockout mice were used as controls. In summary, CNS-excluded CB1 receptor agonists are a novel class of therapeutic agent for spasticity.Pryce, G., Visintin, C., Ramagopalan, S. V., Al-Izki, S., De Faveri, L. E., Nuamah, R.

Antineuroinflammatory strategies have identified the dietary-derived epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as an efficient agent to prevent neuroinflammation-associated neurodegenerative diseases by targeting proinflammatory mediator signaling. Methods: Given that high levels of sphingosine kinase and its product, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), are present in brain tumors, we used quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting to test whether EGCG may impact on S1P receptor gene expression and prevent S1P response in undifferentiated and in terminally differentiated macrophages. Results: Promyelomonocytic human leukemia (HL)-60 cells were differentiated into macrophages, and S1P triggered phosphorylation in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular signaling, as shown by Western blot analysis. Pretreatment of cells with EGCG prior to differentiation inhibited the response to S1P in all three pathways, while EGCG abrogated P38 MAPK phosphorylation when present only during differentiation. Terminally-differentiated macrophages were, however, insensitive to EGCG treatment. Using qRT-PCR, gene expression of the S1P receptors S1P1, S1P2, and S1P5 was predominantly induced in terminally-differentiated macrophages, while the S1P2 was decreased by EGCG treatment. Conclusion: Our data suggest that diet-derived EGCG achieves efficient effects as a preventive agent, targeting signaling pathways prior to cell terminal differentiation. Such properties could impact on cell chemotaxis through the blood-brain barrier and prevent cancer-related neuroinflammation.

ELISA analysis revealed a significant increase in MMP-3 protein levels in CSF from AD subjects, compared to age-matched SCI and MCI cases. No significant differences in MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels were detected between the three groups. MMP-7 was undetectable in all three groups. MCI individuals exhibited increased levels of the metallo-protease inhibitor TIMP-1 in CSF as well as higher plasminogen and neuroserpin expression, compared to SCI subjects. Levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) were significantly reduced in AD CSF. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive association between MMP-3, p-tau, and total-tau levels. Conversely, there was a significant negative correlation between this protease and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. tPA positively correlated with amyloid-beta levels in CSF and with MMSE scores. Our results suggest that MMP-3 and tPA, in combination with current amyloid-beta and tau biomarkers, may have potential as surrogate indicators of an ongoing AD pathology.

Design/methodology/approach - In a simulated SAP business environment, participants' emotional responses were physiologically measured based on electrodermal activity (EDA) while they made business decisions. Findings - Results show that both expert and novice users exhibit considerable EDA activity during their interaction with the ERP system, indicating that ERP use is an emotional process for both groups. However, the findings also indicate that experts' emotional responses led to their sourcing information from the ERP while novices' emotional responses led to their sourcing information from other people. Research limitations/implications - From an academic standpoint, this paper responds to the recent call for more research on the role of emotions for information systems behavior. Practical implications The paper discusses the implications of this finding for the development of ERP system trainings. Originality/value - Because emotions often do not reach users' awareness level, the paper used EDA, a neurophysiological measure, to capture users' emotional responses during ERP decision making, instead of using self-report measures that depend on conscious perception. Based on this method, the paper found that emotions can lead to different behavioral reactions, depending on whether the user is an expert or novice.

Response, remission and drop-out rates following high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treating major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Review						repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; efficacy; meta-analysis; major depression; Acceptability	TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; STAR-ASTERISK-D; ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; BRAIN-STIMULATION; CLINICAL-TRIALS; SAFETY; MOOD	Background Meta-analyses have shown that high-frequency (HF) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has antidepressant properties when compared with sham rTMS. However, its overall response and remission rates in major depression (MD) remain unclear. Thus, we have systematically and quantitatively assessed the efficacy of HF-rTMS for MD based on randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials (RCTs). Method We searched the literature from 1995 through to July 2012 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses. We used a random-effects model, odds ratios (ORs) and the number needed to treat (NNT). Results Data from 29 RCTs were included, totaling 1371 subjects with MD. Following approximately 13 sessions, 29.3% and 18.6% of subjects receiving HF-rTMS were classified as responders and remitters, respectively (compared with 10.4% and 5% of those receiving sham rTMS). The pooled OR was 3.3 (p<0.0001) for both response and remission rates (with associated NNTs of 6 and 8, respectively). Furthermore, we found HF-rTMS to be equally effective as an augmentation strategy or as a monotherapy for MD, and when used in samples with primary unipolar MD or in mixed samples with unipolar and bipolar MD. Also, alternative stimulation parameters were not associated with differential efficacy estimates. Moreover, baseline depression severity and drop-out rates at study end were comparable between the HF-rTMS and sham rTMS groups. Finally, heterogeneity between the included RCTs was not statistically significant. Conclusions HF-rTMS seems to be associated with clinically relevant antidepressant effects and with a benign tolerability profile.	[Berlim, M.

Anecdotal report of magnetophosphene perception in 50 mT 20, 50 and 60 Hz magnetic fields	RADIOPROTECTION			English	Article						magnetophosphene; magnetic field; extremely low frequency; threshold; anecdotal report		Magnetophosphenes are described as flickering lights appearing in the visual field, due to retinal exposure to time-varying magnetic fields (MF). Human magnetophosphene perception (MP) serves as a scientific basis for international guidelines intending to limit exposure to electromagnetic fields in the extremely low frequency range. However, the flux density threshold at which MP occurs, as well as the dose and frequency responses of the phenomenon, are not clearly experimentally established. The 50-60 Hz threshold is extrapolated from data in the lower frequency range. The objective of this paper is to provide a descriptive anecdotal report of MP from 8 individuals exposed to 50 mT MF at 20, 50 and 60 Hz. They describe variations of flickering light perceptions in the visual field, matching the description by D'Arsonval (1896). This preliminary testing introduces a new experimental protocol, which will test the threshold for MP and other associated neurophysiological responses in humans.

J	Ansaldo, AI; Saidi, LG				Ansaldo, Ana Ines; Saidi, Ladan Ghazi			Aphasia Therapy in the Age of Globalization: Cross-Linguistic Therapy Effects in Bilingual Aphasia	BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY			English	Review							SEMANTIC NAMING TREATMENT; LANGUAGE CONTROL; COGNATE; REPRESENTATION; BRAIN; FMRI; CONNECTIVITY; TRANSLATION; RECOVERY; SPEECH	Introduction. Globalization imposes challenges to the field of behavioural neurology, among which is an increase in the prevalence of bilingual aphasia. Thus, aphasiologists have increasingly focused on bilingual aphasia therapy and, more recently, on the identification of the most efficient procedures for triggering language recovery in bilinguals with aphasia. Therapy in both languages is often not available, and, thus, researchers have focused on the transfer of therapy effects from the treated language to the untreated one. Aim. This paper discusses the literature on bilingual aphasia therapy, with a focus on cross-linguistic therapy effects from the language in which therapy is provided to the untreated language. Methods. Fifteen articles including two systematic reviews, providing details on pre- and posttherapy in the adult bilingual population with poststroke aphasia and anomia are discussed with regard to variables that can influence the presence or absence of cross-linguistic transfer of therapy effects. Results and Discussion. The potential for CLT of therapy effects from the treated to the untreated language depends on the word type, the degree of structural overlap between languages, the type of therapy approach, the pre- and postmorbid language proficiency profiles, and the status of the cognitive control circuit.

Evidence: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify key articles relating to the screening, diagnosis, and management of CH. The evidence-based guidelines were developed with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, describing both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. In the absence of sufficient evidence, conclusions were based on expert opinion. Consensus Process: Thirty-two participants drawn from the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and five other major scientific societies in the field of pedi atric endocrinology were allocated to working groups with assigned topics and specific questions. Each group searched the literature, evaluated the evidence, and developed a draft document. These papers were debated and finalized by each group before presentation to the full assembly for further discussion and agreement. Recommendations: The recommendations include: worldwide neonatal screening, approaches to assess the cause (including genotyping) and the severity of the disorder, the immediate initiation of appropriate L-T-4 supplementation and frequent monitoring to ensure dose adjustments to keep thyroid hormone levels in the target ranges, a trial of treatment in patients suspected of transient CH, regular assessments of developmental and neurosensory functions, consulting health professionals as appropriate, and education about CH. The harmonization of diagnosis, management, and routine health surveillance would not only optimize patient outcomes, but should also facilitate epidemiological studies of the disorder. Individuals with CH require monitoring throughout their lives, particularly during early childhood and pregnancy. (C) 2014 S.

However, the effect of these alleles on hippocampal volume in younger subjects has yet to be clearly established. Using a large cohort of more than 1,400 adolescents, this study found no hippocampal volume or hippocampal asymmetry differences between carriers and non-carriers of the ApoE epsilon 4 or epsilon 2 alleles, nor dose-dependent effects of either allele, suggesting that regionally specific effects of these polymorphisms may only become apparent in later life.

Aging is associated with changes in alertness regulation and cognition. Whether the effect of light on cognitive brain function changes with aging is unknown, however. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Functional Neuroimaging Unit, University of Montreal Geriatric Institute. Participants: Sixteen younger (23 +/- 4.1 y) and 14 older (61 +/- 4.5 y) healthy participants were recruited in the current study. Intervention: Blue light administration. Measurements: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain responses to an auditory working memory task in young and older healthy individuals, alternatively maintained in darkness or exposed to blue light. Results: Results show that the older brain remains capable of showing sustained responses to light in several brain areas. However, compared to young individuals, the effect of blue light is decreased in the pulvinar, amygdala, and tegmentum as well as in the insular, prefrontal, and occipital cortices in elderly individuals. Conclusion: The effect of blue light on brain responses diminishes with aging in areas typically involved in visual functions and in key regions for alertness regulation and higher executive processes. Our findings provide the first indications that the effect of light on cognition may be reduced in healthy aging.

Data on neurotoxic effects in older adults are limited. OBJECTIVE: We examined the cross-sectional association between serum PCB concentrations and cognitive function in older adults from the general U.S. population. METHODS: We analyzed data from 708 respondents, 60-84 years of age, participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002). We used the summed concentrations of 12 lipid-standardized PCB congeners as the measure of exposure and assessed cognitive function with the Digit-Symbol Coding test. We adjusted analyses for age, education, race/ethnicity, and poverty/income ratio. RESULTS: The median concentration of lipid-standardized PCBs in serum was 271 ng/g (inter-quartile range, 193-399 ng/g). We found a significant interaction between dioxin-like PCB concentration and age in association with cognitive score (p = 0.04). Among older individuals (70-84 years of age), a 100-ng/g increase in serum concentrations of dioxin-like PCBs was associated with a significantly lower cognitive score (-2.7 points; 95% CI: -5.1, -0.2; p = 0.04); however, in younger individuals (60-69 years of age), there was a non-significant positive association (2.9 points; 95% CI: -1.8, 7.7; p = 0.32). Among the older participants, the negative association was more pronounced in women than in men. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that PCB exposure has adverse cognitive effects even at levels generally considered to pose low or no risk, perhaps affecting mainly those of advanced age.

Methods: We collected all published randomized clinical trials in RRMS lasting at least 2 years and including as endpoints disability progression (defined as 6 or 3 months confirmed 1-point increase on the Expanded Disability Status Scale), active magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions (defined as new/enlarging T2 lesions), and brain atrophy (defined as change in brain volume between month 24 and month 6-12). Treatment effects were expressed as relative reductions. A linear regression, weighted for trial size and duration, was used to assess the relationship between the treatment effects on MRI markers and on disability progression. Results: Thirteen trials including >13,500 RRMS patients were included in the meta-analysis. Treatment effects on disability progression were correlated with treatment effects both on brain atrophy (R-2 = 0.48, p = 0.001) and on active MRI lesions (R-2 = 0.61, p < 0.001). When the effects on both MRI endpoints were included in a multivariate model, the correlation was higher (R-2 = 0.75, p < 0.001), and both variables were retained as independently related to the treatment effect on disability progression. Interpretation: In RRMS, the treatment effect on brain atrophy is correlated with the effect on disability progression over 2 years. This effect is independent of the effect of active MRI lesions on disability; the 2 MRI measures predict the treatment effect on disability more closely when used in combination.

Neurocognition: Clinical and Functional Outcomes in Schizophrenia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE			English	Review						neurocognition; remission; clinical outcome; functional outcome; schizophrenia; impairment	SEVERE MENTAL-ILLNESS; CONSENSUS COGNITIVE BATTERY; PERSISTENT NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; RECENT-ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS; REAL-WORLD BEHAVIOR; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; VOCATIONAL-REHABILITATION; SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER; SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT	Schizophrenia is characterized by significant heterogeneity in outcome. The last decades have witnessed a significant interest in identifying factors that can moderate or influence clinical and functional outcomes in people with schizophrenia. One factor of particular interest is neurocognition, as performance on various measures of cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, and executive functions, have been consistently related to functional outcome and, to a lesser extent, clinical outcome. This review aims to provide an up-to-date description of recent studies examining the association between neurocognition and clinical and (or) functional outcomes. In the first section, studies examining neurocognitive performance in relation to clinical outcome are examined. When clinical outcome is defined dichotomously (for example, comparing remitted and nonremitted), verbal memory performance consistently exhibits a strong association with clinical status, with the poor outcome group showing the largest deficits. In the second section, studies exploring the relation between neurocognition and various dimensions of functional outcome are reviewed. These dimensions include independent living, social functioning, and vocational functioning, among others. Again, a strong link between neurocognitive deficits and impairments in several aspects of functioning clearly emerges from this review. Finally, several measurement issues are discussed that pertain to the need to standardize definitions of clinical and (or) functional outcomes, the importance of defining cognitive domains consistently across studies, and distinguishing between one's competence to perform tasks and what one actually does in everyday life. Addressing these measurement issues will be key to studies examining the development of effective interventions targeting neurocognitive functions and their impact on clinical and functional outcomes.

The objectives of this study were to systematically review all published articles that examined the relation between neurocognitive deficits and suicidal or homicidal behaviours in schizophrenia, and to identify vulnerabilities in suicidal and homicidal behaviour that may share a common pathway in schizophrenia. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE to include all studies published up to August 31, 2012. Results: Among the 1760 studies, 7 neuropsychological and 12 brain imaging studies met the selection criteria and were included in the final analysis. The neuropsychological and functional neuroimaging studies were inconclusive. The structural imaging studies reported various alterations in patients with schizophrenia and a history of homicidal behaviour, including: reduced inferior frontal and temporal cortices, increased mediodorsal white matter, and increased amygdala volumes. Patients with a history of suicidal acts showed volumetric reductions in left orbitofrontal and superior temporal cortices, while right amygdala volume was increased, though, these findings have rarely been replicated. Finally, no study has directly compared neurocognitive markers of suicidal and homicidal risk. Conclusion: These results suggest that brain alterations, in addition to those associated with schizophrenia, may predispose some patients to a higher risk of homicide or suicide in particular circumstances. Moreover, some of these alterations may be shared between homicidal and suicidal patients. However, owing to several limitations, including the small number of available studies, no firm conclusions can be drawn and further investigations are necessary.

J	Chalk, CH; Benstead, TJ; Keezer, M				Chalk, Colin H.; Benstead, Tim J.; Keezer, Mark			Medical treatment for botulism	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						*Clostridium botulinum; Botulism [*therapy]; Hospitalization; Immunoglobulins [*therapeutic use]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic	INFANT BOTULISM; IMMUNE GLOBULIN; GUANIDINE; ANTITOXIN; MANAGEMENT	Background Botulism is an acute paralytic illness caused by a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Supportive care, including intensive care, is key but the role of other medical treatments is unclear. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. Objectives To assess the effects of medical treatments on mortality, duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, tube or parenteral feeding and risk of adverse events in botulism. Search methods On 30 March 2013, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (30 March 2013), CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2013) and EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2013). We reviewed bibliographies and contacted authors and experts. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials examining the medical treatment of any of the four major types of botulism (infant intestinal botulism, food-borne botulism, wound botulism and adult intestinal toxemia). Potential medical treatments included equine serum trivalent botulism antitoxin, human-derived botulinum immune globulin, plasma exchange, 3,4-diaminopyridine and guanidine. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data onto data extraction forms. Our primary outcome was in-hospital death from any cause occurring within four weeks. Secondary outcomes were death occurring within 12 weeks, duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, tube or parenteral feeding and risk of adverse events. Main results A single randomized controlled trial met the inclusion criteria. We found no additional trials when we updated the searches in 2013. This trial evaluated human-derived botulinum immune globulin (BIG) for the treatment of infant botulism and included 59 treatment participants as well as 63 control participants. The control group received a control immune globulin which did not have an effect on botulinum toxin. In this trial there was some violation of intention-to-treat principles, and possibly some between-treatment group imbalances among those participants admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanically ventilated, but overall we judged the risk of bias to be low. There were no deaths in either group, making any treatment effect on mortality inestimable. There was a significant benefit in the treatment group on mean duration of hospitalization (BIG: 2.60 weeks, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.25; control: 5.70 weeks, 95% CI 4.40 to 7.00; mean difference (MD) 3.10 weeks, 95% CI 1.68 to 4.52), mechanical ventilation (BIG: 1.80 weeks, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.40; control: 4.40 weeks, 95% CI 3.00 to 5.80; MD 2.60 weeks, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.06), and tube or parenteral feeding (BIG: 3.60 weeks, 95% CI 1.70 to 5.50; control: 10.00 weeks, 95% CI 6.85 to 13.15; MD 6.40 weeks, 95% CI 2.80 to 10.00) but not on risk of adverse events or complications (BIG: 63.08%; control: 68.75%; risk ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.18; absolute risk reduction 0.06, 95% CI 0.22 to -0.11). Authors' conclusions There is evidence supporting the use of human-derived botulinum immune globulin (BIG) in infant intestinal botulism. A single randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant decreases in the duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and tube or parenteral feeding with BIG treatment. This evidence was of moderate quality for effects on duration of mechanical ventilation but was otherwise of high quality. Our search did not reveal any evidence examining the use of other medical treatments including serum trivalent botulism antitoxin.

Stress, serotonin, and hippocampal neurogenesis in relation to depression and antidepressant effects	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Stress; Neurogenesis; Serotonin; Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; Chronic unpredictable stress; Depression; Neurotrophic factors; Antidepressant	CHRONIC MILD STRESS; DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FREELY MOVING CATS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR BDNF; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; ADULT-RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENTAL MODEL; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR	Chronic stressful life events are risk factors for developing major depression, the pathophysiology of which is strongly linked to impairments in serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission. Exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) has been found to induce depressive-like behaviours, including passive behavioural coping and anhedonia in animal models, along with many other affective, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms. The heterogeneity of these symptoms represents the plurality of corticolimbic structures involved in mood regulation that are adversely affected in the disorder. Chronic stress has also been shown to negatively regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a phenomenon that is involved in antidepressant effects and regulates subsequent stress responses. Although there exists an enormous body of data on stress-induced alterations of 5-HT activity, there has not been extensive exploration of 5-HT adaptations occurring presynaptically or at the level of the raphe nuclei after exposure to CUS. Similarly, although hippocampal neurogenesis is known to be negatively regulated by stress and positively regulated by antidepressant treatment, the role of neurogenesis in mediating affective behaviour in the context of stress remains an active area of investigation. The goal of this review is to link the serotonergic and neurogenic hypotheses of depression and antidepressant effects in the context of stress. Specifically, chronic stress significantly attenuates 5-HT neurotransmission and 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity, and this effect could represent an endophenotypic hallmark for mood disorders. In addition, by decreasing neurogenesis, CUS decreases hippocampal inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, exacerbating stress axis overactivity. Similarly, we discuss the possibility that adult hippocampal neurogenesis mediates antidepressant effects via the ventral (in rodents; anterior in humans) hippocampus' influence on the HPA axis, and mechanisms by which antidepressants may reverse chronic stress-induced 5-HT and neurogenic changes. Although data are as yet equivocal, antidepressant modulation of 5-HT neurotransmission may well serve as one of the factors that could drive neurogenesis-dependent antidepressant effects through these stress regulation-related mechanisms.

However, the nature of the STS preference for these 'social stimuli' remains unclear, as does the location within the STS for specific types of information processing. The aim of this study was to directly examine properties of the STS in terms of selective response to social stimuli. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan participants whilst they were presented with auditory, visual, or audiovisual stimuli of people or objects, with the intention of localising areas preferring both faces and voices (i.e., 'people-selective' regions) and audiovisual regions designed to specifically integrate person-related information. Results highlighted a 'people-selective, heteromodal' region in the trunk of the right STS which was activated by both faces and voices, and a restricted portion of the right posterior STS (pSTS) with an integrative preference for information from people, as compared to objects. These results point towards the dedicated role of the STS as a 'social-information processing' centre. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although abnormal functional connectivity has been uncovered in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) in previous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, little is known regarding the structural connectivity in CAE. We hypothesized that the structural connectivity would be disrupted in response to the decreased brain function in CAE. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging tractography was utilized to map the white matter (WM) structural network, composed of 90 cortical and sub-cortical regions, in 18 CAE and 18 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Graph theoretical methods were applied to investigate the alterations in the topological and nodal properties of the networks in these patients. Results: Both the CAE and the controls showed small-world properties in their WM networks. However, the network connection strength, absolute clustering coefficient, and global/local efficiency were significantly decreased, but characteristic path length was significantly increased in the CAE compared with the controls. Significantly decreased WM connections, nodal properties, and impaired sub-networks were found in the sub-cortical structures, orbitofrontal area, and limbic cortex in the CAE. Moreover, network connection strength, local efficiency, and nodal features in some regions were significantly negatively correlated with the duration of epilepsy. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated, for the first time, the disrupted topological organization of WM networks in CAE. The decreased connectivity and efficiency in the orbitofrontal and sub-cortical regions may serve as anatomical evidence to support the functional abnormalities related to the epileptic discharges observed in CAE. Moreover, the orbitofrontal sub-network may play a key role in CAE. These findings open up new avenues toward the understanding of absence epilepsy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The expression of QRFP in adipose tissue is reduced in diet-induced obesity, a mouse model in which plasma concentrations of endotoxins are slightly elevated. The present study investigated the role of metabolic endotoxemia (ME) on QRFP gene regulation. Our results uncovered the expression of QRFP in murine macrophages and cell lines. This expression has been found to be decreased in mice with ME. Low doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transiently down-regulated QRFP by 59% in RAW264.7 macrophages but not in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The effect of LPS on QRFP expression in macrophages was dependent on the inhibitor of kB kinase and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon (IFN)-beta (TRIF) but not myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88. IFN-beta was induced by ME in macrophages. IFN-beta sustainably reduced QRFP expression in macrophages (64%) and adipocytes (49%). IFN-gamma dwown-regulated QRFP (74%) in macrophages only. Both IFNs inhibited QRFP secretion from macrophages. LPS-stimulated macrophage-conditioned medium reduced QRFP expression in adipocytes, an effect blocked by IFN-beta neutralizing antibody. The effect of IFN-beta on QRFP expression was dependent on phosphoinositide 3-kinase, p38 MAPK, and histone deacetylases. The effect of IFN-gamma was dependent on MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2 and histone deacetylases. Macrophage-conditioned medium containing increased amounts of QRFP preserved adipogenesis in adipocytes. In conclusion, LPS induces IFN-beta release from macrophages, which reduces QRFP expression in both macrophages and adipocytes in an autocrine/paracrine-dependent manner, suggesting QRFP as a potential biomarker in ME.

Using rTMS, we investigated whether the contribution of the SMG to phonological processing is domain specific (specific to phonology) or more domain general (specific to verbal working memory). A measure of phonological complexity was developed based on sonority differences and subjects were tested after low frequency rTMS on a same/different judgment task and an n-back verbal memory task. It was reasoned that if the phonological processing in the SMG is more domain general, i.e., related to verbal working memory demands, performance would be more affected by the rTMS during the n-back task than during the same/different judgment task. Two auditory experiments were conducted. The first experiment demonstrated that under conditions where working memory demands are minimized (i.e. same/different judgment), repetitive stimulation had no effect on performance although performance varied as a function of phonological complexity. The second experiment demonstrated that during a verbal working memory task (n-back task), where phonological complexity was also manipulated, subjects were less accurate and slower at performing the task after stimulation but the effect of phonology was not affected. The results confirm that the SMG is involved in verbal working memory but not in the encoding of sonority differences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pierini, D; Hoerold, D				Pierini, Davide; Hoerold, Doreen			Back home after an acquired brain injury: Building a "low-cost" team to provide theory-driven cognitive rehabilitation after routine interventions	NEUROREHABILITATION			English	Article						Acquired brain injury; cognitive rehabilitation; home-based rehabilitation; rehabilitation team; post-acute rehabilitation; post-acute recovery	ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY; STROKE; OUTCOMES; SKILLS	BACKGROUND: Individuals with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) could benefit from further cognitive rehabilitation, after they have returned home. However, a lack of specialist services to provide such rehabilitation often prevents this. This leads to reduced reintegration of patients, increased social disadvantages and ultimately, higher economic costs. METHOD: 10 months post-stroke, a 69 year-old woman was discharged from an inpatient rehabilitation program and returned home with severe cognitive impairments. We describe a pilot project which provided an individualised, low cost rehabilitation program, supervised and trained by a neuropsychologist. Progress was monitored every 3 months in order to decide on continuation of the program, based on the achieved results and predicted costs. RESULTS: Post intervention, despite severe initial impairment, cognitive and most notably daily functioning had improved. Although the financial investment was moderately high for the family, the intervention was still considered cost-effective when compared with the required costs of care in a local non-specialist care home. Moreover, the pilot experience was used to build a "local expert team" available for other individuals requiring rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: These results encourage the development of similar local "low cost" teams in the community, to provide scientifically-grounded cognitive rehabilitation for ABI patients returning home.

Although cellular metabolism is known to regulate excitatory neurotransmission, it is still unclear whether the brain's energy supply affects inhibitory signalling. Here we show that mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (mROS) regulate the strength of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors at inhibitory synapses of cerebellar stellate cells. Inhibition is strengthened through a mechanism that selectively recruits alpha 3-containing GABA(A) receptors into synapses with no discernible effect on resident alpha 1-containing receptors. Since mROS promotes the emergence of postsynaptic events with unique kinetic properties, we conclude that newly recruited alpha 3-containing GABA(A) receptors are activated by neurotransmitter released onto discrete postsynaptic sites. Although traditionally associated with oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disease, our data identify mROS as a putative homeostatic signalling molecule coupling cellular metabolism to the strength of inhibitory transmission.

Endoscopic release for carpal tunnel syndrome	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; FOLLOW-UP; MORPHOLOGIC CHANGES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; INCISION OPEN; MINI-OPEN; DECOMPRESSION; LIGAMENT; SURGERY; COMPLICATIONS	Background Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy of the upper extremity. It is caused by increased pressure on the median nerve between the transverse carpal ligament and the carpal bones. Surgical treatment consists of the release of the nerve by cutting the transverse carpal ligament. This can be done either with an open approach or endoscopically. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of the endoscopic techniques of carpal tunnel release compared to any other surgical intervention for the treatment of CTS. More specifically, to evaluate the relative impact of endoscopic techniques in relieving symptoms, producing functional recovery (return to work and return to daily activities) and reducing complication rates. Search methods This review fully incorporates the results of searches conducted up to 5 November 2012, when we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted trial authors. We also searched trial registers for ongoing trials. We performed a preliminary screen of searches to November 2013 to identify any additional recent publications. Selection criteria We included any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) with any other surgical intervention for the treatment of CTS. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Main results Twenty-eight studies (2586 hands) were included. Twenty-three studies compared ECTR to standard open carpal tunnel release (OCTR), five studies compared ECTR with OCTR using a modified incision, and two studies used a three-arm design to compare ECTR, standard OCTR and modified OCTR. At short-term follow-up (three months or less), only one study provided data for overall improvement. We found no differences on the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) (scale zero to five) (five studies, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.13, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.21) or on the Functional Status Scale (FSS) (scale zero to five) (five studies, SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.14) within three months postoperatively between ECTR and OCTR. Pain scores favoured ECTR over conventional OCTR (two studies, SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.18). No difference was found between ECTR and OCTR (standard and modified) when pain was assessed on non-continuous dichotomous scales (five studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.45). Also, no difference was found in numbness (five studies, RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.71). Grip strength was increased after ECTR when compared with OCTR (six studies, SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.63). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of 4 kg (95% CI 1 to 6.9 kg) when compared with OCTR, which is probably not clinically significant. In the long term (more than three months postoperatively) there was no significant difference in overall improvement between ECTR and OCTR (four studies, RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.14). SSS and FSS were also similar in both treatment groups (two studies, MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.22 for SSS and MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.16 for FSS). ECTR and OCTR did not differ in the long term in pain (six studies, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.38) or in numbness (four studies, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.35). Results from grip strength testing favoured ECTR (two studies, SMD 1.13, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.71), corresponding to an MD of 11 kg (95% CI 6.2 to 18.81). Participants treated with ECTR returned to work or daily activities eight days earlier than participants treated with OCTR (four studies, MD -8.10 days, 95% CI -14.28 to -1.92 days). Both treatments were equally safe with only a few reports of major complications (mainly with complex regional pain syndrome) (15 studies, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.64). ECTR resulted in a significantly lower rate of minor complications (18 studies, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81), corresponding to a 45% relative drop in the probability of complications (95% CI 62% to 19%). ECTR more frequently resulted in transient nerve problems (ie, neurapraxia, numbness, and paraesthesiae), while OCTR had more wound problems (ie, infection, hypertrophic scarring, and scar tenderness). ECTR was safer than OCTR when the total number of complications were assessed (20 studies, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 90) representing a relative drop in the probability by 40% (95% CI 60% to 10%). Rates of recurrence of symptoms and the need for repeated surgery were comparable between ECTR and OCTR groups. The overall risk of bias in studies that contribute data to these results is rather high; fewer than 25% of the included studies had adequate allocation concealment, generation of allocation sequence or blinding of the outcome assessor. The quality of evidence in this review may be considered as generally low. Five of the studies were presented only as abstracts, with insufficient information to judge their risk of bias. In selection bias, attrition bias or other bias (baseline differences and financial conflict of interest) we could not reach a safe judgement regarding a high or low risk of bias. Blinding of participants is impossible due to the nature of interventions. We identified three further potentially eligible studies upon updating searches just prior to publication. These compared ECTR with OCTR (two studies) or mini-open carpal tunnel release (one study) and will be fully assessed when we update the review. Authors' conclusions In this review, with support from low quality evidence only, OCTR and ECTR for carpal tunnel release are about as effective as each other in relieving symptoms and improving functional status, although there may be a functionally significant benefit of ECTR over OCTR in improvement in grip strength. ECTR appears to be associated with fewer minor complications compared to OCTR, but we found no difference in the rates of major complications. Return to work is faster after endoscopic release, by eight days on average. Conclusions from this review are limited by the high risk of bias, statistical imprecision and inconsistency in the included studies.

Assessing performance in brain tumor resection using a novel virtual reality simulator	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY			English	Article						NeuroTouch; Virtual reality simulation; Haptic feedback; Brain tumor resection; Neurosurgical oncology; Performance metrics	SINUS SURGERY SIMULATOR; SURGICAL SKILLS; CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY; AUGMENTED REALITY; OPERATING-ROOM; NEUROSURGERY; EXPERIENCE; RESIDENTS; VENTRICULOSTOMY; GENDER	NeuroTouch is a virtual reality (VR) simulator developed for neurosurgical skill training. Validation demonstrating that the system is useful and reliable is required for formal adoption into training curriculums. Face and content validity have been demonstrated for some neurosurgical simulators, but construct validity remains difficult to establish. A pilot validation study was conducted for a NeuroTouch training exercise. Participants completed the internal resection of a simulated convexity meningioma and filled out questionnaires to provide feedback on the experience. Performance metrics included volume of tissues removed, tool path lengths, duration of excessive forces applied and efficient use of the aspirator. Results were analyzed according to participants' level of training, gender, handedness, surgical experience in meningioma removal and hours/week playing musical instruments or video games. Seventy-two participants (10 medical students, 18 junior residents and 44 senior residents) were enrolled. Analyses demonstrated statistically significant increase in tumor removed and efficiency of ultrasonic aspirator use between medical students and residents, but not between junior and senior residents. After covariate adjustment for the number of meningioma cases operated on, multivariate analysis of the level of training became nonsignificant. Participants judged the exercise appropriate and realistic, desiring use of the system in current training programs. We have conducted a pilot validation study for the NeuroTouch tumor resection scenario and demonstrated for the first time, face, content and construct validity of a VR neurosurgical simulation exercise. Future full-scale studies will be conducted in noncompetitive settings and incorporate expert participants.

Placement of Deep Brain Electrodes in the Dog Using the Brainsight Frameless Stereotactic System: A Pilot Feasibility Study	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Canine; Deep brain stimulation; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy	TERM-FOLLOW-UP; ANTERIOR NUCLEUS; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; REFRACTORY EPILEPSY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; THALAMIC-STIMULATION; IDIOPATHIC EPILEPSY; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; DIAGNOSTIC YIELD	BackgroundDeep brain stimulation (DBS) together with concurrent EEG recording has shown promise in the treatment of epilepsy. A novel device is capable of combining these 2 functions and may prove valuable in the treatment of epilepsy in dogs. However, stereotactic implantation of electrodes in dogs has not yet been evaluated. ObjectiveTo evaluate the feasibility and safety of implanting stimulating and recording electrodes in the brain of normal dogs using the Brainsight system and to evaluate the function of a novel DBS and recording device. AnimalsFour male intact Greyhounds, confirmed to be normal by clinical and neurologic examinations and hematology and biochemistry testing. MethodsMRI imaging of the brain was performed after attachment of fiducial markers. MRI scans were used to calculate trajectories for electrode placement in the thalamus and hippocampus, which was performed via burr hole craniotomy. Postoperative CT scanning was performed to evaluate electrode location and accuracy of placement was calculated. Serial neurologic examinations were performed to evaluate neurologic deficits and EEG recordings obtained to evaluate the effects of stimulation. ResultsElectrodes were successfully placed in 3 of 4 dogs with a mean accuracy of 4.61.5mm. EEG recordings showed evoked potentials in response to stimulation with a circadian variation in time-to-maximal amplitude. No neurologic deficits were seen in any dog. Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceStereotactic placement of electrodes is safe and feasible in the dog. The development of a novel device capable of providing simultaneous neurostimulation and EEG recording potentially represents a major advance in the treatment of epilepsy.

Elevated dynorphin levels have been reported in postmortem samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and prodynorphin (PDYN) gene polymorphisnns might be linked to cognitive function in the elderly. Activation of kappa-opioid receptors by dynorphins has been associated with stress-related memory impairments. Interestingly, these peptides can also modulate glutamate neurotransmission and may affect synaptic plasticity underlying memory formation. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazol-propionate (AMPA) ionotropic glutamate receptor levels generally decrease with aging, and their function is impaired in AD. Methods: Here, we compared the impact of aging on ionotropic glutamate receptor levels in the hippocampal formation of wild-type (WT) and Pdyn knock-out (KO) mice. Results: We observed a significant reduction in GluR1 and GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits in the hippocampal formation of 18- to 25-month-old WT mice in comparison with 6-month-old mice. Conversely, the GluR1 protein level was maintained in old Pdyn KO mice, and the NMDA NR2B subunit level was increased by 42% when compared to old WT animals. Conclusions: These results suggest that elevated dynorphin expression occurring during aging and AD may mediate cognitive deficits by altering the glutamatergic system integrity. (C) 2013 S.

The relationship between these clinical manifestations and the biological changes caused by starvation is not well understood. It has been hypothesised that reduced availability of tryptophan (TRP) could reduce serotonin activity and thus trigger these comorbid symptoms. The aim of this study, during re-feeding in individuals with AN, was to analyse covariations across measures of nutritional status, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and peripheral serotonin markers. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, nutritional status and serotonin markers -whole blood serotonin content, plasma TRP and the ratio between TRP and large neutral amino acids - were assessed for 42 AN participants at admission to inpatient treatment and after re-feeding. Biological measures were compared to those obtained in 42 non-eating disordered subjects. For those with AN, psychological, nutritional and biological parameters improved significantly during hospitalisation. Levels of serotonin markers were significantly lower in the AN group compared to the control group, at admission and at discharge. Increase in the TRP/LNAA ratio was correlated with a decrease in depressive symptoms. In addition, there was a positive correlation between serotonin levels and symptoms of both anxiety and depression at discharge. We speculate that enhanced TRP availability during re-feeding, as a result of the increase in the TRP/LNAA ratio, could restore serotonin neurotransmission and lead to a decrease in depressive symptoms. The association between serotonin and anxiety and depressive symptoms would be consistent with numerous observations indicating abnormal functioning of the serotoninergic system in AN.

Global developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID) with speech/language delay and behavioral problems as the most affected domains was present in 44 participants, with additional epilepsy present in 35 and movement disorder in 13. Treatment regimens included various combinations/dosages of creatine-monohydrate, L-ornithine, sodium benzoate and protein/arginine restricted diets. The median age at treatment initiation was 25.5 and 39 months in patients with mild and moderate DD/ID, respectively, and 11 years in patients with severe DD/ID. Increase of cerebral creatine and decrease of plasma/CSF guanidinoacetate levels were achieved by supplementation with creatine-monohydrate combined with high dosages of t-ornithine and/or an arginine-restricted diet (250 mg/kg/d L-arginine). Therapy was associated with improvement or stabilization of symptoms in all of the symptomatic cases. The 4 patients treated younger than 9 months had normal or almost normal developmental outcomes. One with inconsistent compliance had a borderline IQ at age 8.6 years.

The use of cognitive strategies optimizes performance in complex everyday tasks such as shopping. This exploratory study examined the cognitive strategies people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) effectively use in an unstructured, real-world situation. METHOD. A behavioral analysis of the self-generated strategic behaviors of 5 people with severe TBI using videotaped sessions of an ecological shopping task (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Profile) was performed. RESULTS. All participants used some form of cognitive strategy in an unstructured real-world shopping task, although the number, type, and degree of effectiveness of the strategies in leading to goal attainment varied. The most independent person used the largest number and a broader repertoire of self-generated strategies. CONCLUSION. These results provide initial evidence that occupational therapists should examine the use of self-generated cognitive strategies in real-world contexts as a potential means of guiding therapy aimed at improving independence in everyday activities for people with TBI.

Tailoring chronic pain treatments for the elderly: are we prepared for the challenge?

The aging 'baby-boomer' generation is creating a tsunami of elderly patients (>65 years old) for global healthcare systems (between 2010 and 2030). The phenotypic expression of chronic pain in the elderly can be influenced by co-morbid diseases (e.g. diabetes, cancer, depression, Alzheimer's disease, etc.), changes in physiological competency (e.g. drug metabolism/elimination) or cognitive reserve. Will a shift in the drug discovery paradigm be required to improve efficacy, side-effects or positively impact quality of life (QoL) in the elderly with chronic pain? This review highlights a number of potential pitfalls that should be considered when delivering valued pain relief medicines tailored for the elderly.	[Arneric, Stephen P.; Laird, Jennifer M.

Astrocyte-Secreted Matricellular Proteins in CNS Remodelling during Development and Disease	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; TISSUE GROWTH-FACTOR; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX GLYCOPROTEIN; PROMOTES NEURITE OUTGROWTH; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; CELL-ADHESION MOLECULE; TENASCIN-C; REACTIVE ASTROCYTES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE	Matricellular proteins are secreted, nonstructural proteins that regulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) and interactions between cells through modulation of growth factor signaling, cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. Despite being well described in the context of nonneuronal tissues, recent studies have revealed that these molecules may also play instrumental roles in central nervous system (CNS) development and diseases. In this minireview, we discuss the matricellular protein families SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), Hevin/SC1 (SPARC-like 1), TN-C (Tenascin C), TSP (Thrombospondin), and CCN (CYR61/CTGF/NOV), which are secreted by astrocytes during development. These proteins exhibit a reduced expression in adult CNS but are upregulated in reactive astrocytes following injury or disease, where they are well placed to modulate the repair processes such as tissue remodeling, axon regeneration, glial scar formation, angiogenesis, and rewiring of neural circuitry. Conversely, their reexpression in reactive astrocytes may also lead to detrimental effects and promote the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

Theory predicts that experience of psychosocial stress is associated both with ventromedial prefrontal and mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission. However, while there is evidence of aberrant striatal dopamine processing in psychotic disorder, the role of the prefrontal cortex remains under-researched. This study aimed at investigating stress-induced in vivo dopamine release in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) of individuals at familial risk for psychosis. Method: Fourteen healthy first-degree relatives of patients with a diagnosis of psychotic disorder and 10 control subjects underwent a single dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scanning session after intravenous administration of 183.2 (SD = 7.6) MBq [18F] fallypride. Psychosocial stress was initiated at 100 min post-injection using a computerized mental arithmetic task with social evaluative threat components. PET data were analyzed using the linearized simplified reference region model. Regression analyses were performed to compare the spatial extent of task-related ligand displacement between control subjects and relatives and to find how it related to self-rated experiences of psychosocial stress and psychosis. Results: First-degree relatives displayed hyporeactive dopamine signaling in the vmPFC in response to stress. Increased levels of subjectively rated stress were associated with increased intensity of psychotic experiences. This effect was particularly pronounced in first-degree relatives. Conclusion: Although previous studies have hypothesized a role for prefrontal dopamine dysfunction in psychosis, this study, to our knowledge, is the first in vivo human imaging study showing attenuated (ie, hyporeactive) dopamine stress neuromodulation in vmPFC of individuals at familial risk for psychosis.

Individual differences in vulnerability, though, have been indicated by subjective responses to alcohol ingestion and personality traits. MethodsTo investigate the relationship between these features and striatal dopamine (DA) responses to alcohol, we studied 26 healthy young social drinkers (21.33.0years old; 10.78.8drinks/wk) at varying risk for alcoholism. Each participant received 2 positron emission tomography [C-11]raclopride scans after administration of either placebo or oral alcohol (1ml/kg body weight of 94% alcohol, 0.75g/kg) in a randomized and counterbalanced design. ResultsSubjects with high-risk subjective responses to alcohol had more family members with AUDs, greater alcohol use problems, and, in response to the alcohol challenge, significant decreases in [C-11]raclopride binding indicative of increased extracellular DA. In contrast, low-risk subjects exhibited increases in [C-11]raclopride binding in response to alcohol. The results were similar when risk groups were based on personality traits, although statistically less robust. ConclusionsChanges in striatal DA in response to alcohol ingestion may be a neurobiological marker of vulnerability to AUDs.

The resulting innovation provides a highly robust sensory based controller that can be adapted to systems which require multi-muscle co-ordination. It provides human-like responses during perturbations elicited either internally or by the environment and for simple point-to-point reaching. We simulate limb motion and EMGs in Simulink using Virtual Muscle models and a variety of paradigms, including motion with external perturbations, and varying levels of antagonist muscle co-contractions. The results show that the system can exhibit smooth coordinated motions, without explicit kinematic or dynamic planning even in the presence of perturbations. In addition, we show by varying the level of muscle co-contractions from 0% to 40%, that the effects of external perturbations on joint trajectories can be reduced by up to 42%. The improved controller design is novel providing robust behavior during dynamic events and an automatic adaptive response from sensory-integration.

Accurate and Reliable Gait Cycle Detection in Parkinson's Disease	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Angular rate reversal; continuous walking gait analysis; gyroscope; medical instrumentation; Parkinsons; stride event detection; stride time validation; stride time variability	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; AMBULATORY SYSTEM; WALKING SPEED; OLDER-ADULTS; RELIABILITY; PARAMETERS; FALLS; VARIABILITY; GYROSCOPES; VALIDITY	There is a growing interest in the use of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based systems that employ gyroscopes for gait analysis. We describe an improved IMU-based gait analysis processing method that uses gyroscope angular rate reversal to identify the start of each gait cycle during walking. In validation tests with six subjects with Parkinson disease (PD), including those with severe shuffling gait patterns, and seven controls, the probability of True-Positive event detection and False-Positive event detection was 100% and 0%, respectively. Stride time validation tests using high-speed cameras yielded a standard deviation of 6.6 ms for controls and 11.8 ms for those with PD. These data demonstrate that the use of our angular rate reversal algorithm leads to improvements over previous gyroscope-based gait analysis systems. Highly accurate and reliable stride time measurements enabled us to detect subtle changes in stride time variability following a Parkinson's exercise class. We found unacceptable measurement accuracy for stride length when using the Aminian et al. gyro-based biomechanical algorithm, with errors as high as 30% in PD subjects. An alternative method, using synchronized infrared timing gates to measure velocity, combined with accurate mean stride time from our angular rate reversal algorithm, more accurately calculates mean stride length.

Phenotypic plasticity is maintained despite geographical isolation in an African cichlid fish, Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor	INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY			English	Article						brain; geometric morphometrics; gills; hypoxia; riverine fish	DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; EVOLUTION; FITNESS; HYPOXIA; REGIMES; BRAINS; COSTS	Gene flow among populations in different selective environments should favor the evolution of phenotypic plasticity over local adaptation. Plasticity in development is a common response to long-term hypoxia in some widespread African fishes, including Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor, a cichlid that exploits both normoxic (high oxygen) rivers/lakes and hypoxic (low oxygen) swamps. Previous studies have shown that fish from normoxic and hypoxic sites differ in many traits, including gill size, brain size and body shape, and that much of this variation reflects developmental plasticity. However, these earlier studies focused on areas in Uganda where gene flow between swamp and river or lake populations is high. In this study we tested the hypothesis that P. multicolor from a relatively isolated lake population (Lake Saka, Uganda) exhibit low levels of plasticity in traits related to oxygen uptake. Multiple broods of P. multicolor from Lake Saka were reared under low and high dissolved oxygen, and traits related to gill size, brain mass and body shape were quantified. Surprisingly, both gill size and brain mass showed high levels of developmental plasticity. We suggest that high levels of plasticity, particularly in the gill size of P. multicolor, reflects low costs of maintaining the plastic response, even in relatively isolated populations.

J	Hurd, YL; Michaelides, M; Miller, ML; Jutras-Aswad, D				Hurd, Yasmin L.; Michaelides, Michael; Miller, Michael L.; Jutras-Aswad, Didier			Trajectory of adolescent cannabis use on addiction vulnerability	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						Marijuana; Cannabinoid; Opioid neuropeptide; Nucleus accumbens; Prefrontal cortex	RECEPTOR MESSENGER-RNA; ILLICIT DRUG-USE; PROENKEPHALIN GENE-EXPRESSION; BRAIN GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE; MARIJUANA USE; RAT-BRAIN; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; DOPAMINE-D-2 RECEPTORS; GATEWAY HYPOTHESIS	The adolescent brain is a period of dynamic development making it vulnerable to environmental factors such as drug exposure. Of the illicit drugs, cannabis is most used by teenagers since it is perceived by many to be of little harm. This perception has led to a growing number of states approving its legalization and increased accessibility. Most of the debates and ensuing policies regarding cannabis were done without consideration of its impact on one of the most vulnerable population, namely teens, or without consideration of scientific data. We provide an overview of the endocannabinoid system in relation to adolescent cannabis exposure and provide insights regarding factors such as genetics and behavioral traits that confer risk for subsequent addiction. While it is clear that more systematic scientific studies are needed to understand the long-term impact of adolescent cannabis exposure on brain and behavior, the current evidence suggests that it has a far-reaching influence on adult addictive behaviors particularly for certain subsets of vulnerable individuals.

FORGE Canada Consortium	Exome Sequencing as a Diagnostic Tool for Pediatric-Onset Ataxia	HUMAN MUTATION			English	Article						ataxia; whole-exome sequencing; clinical diagnosis	INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; WHOLE-EXOME; MUTATIONS; DISCOVERY; DISEASE; DISORDERS; VARIANTS; GENOMES	Ataxia demonstrates substantial phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. We set out to determine the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing in pediatric patients with ataxia without a molecular diagnosis after standard-of-care assessment in Canada. FORGE (Finding Of Rare disease GEnes) Canada is a nation-wide project focused on identifying novel disease genes for rare pediatric diseases using whole-exome sequencing. We retrospectively selected all FORGE Canada projects that included cerebellar ataxia as a feature. We identified 28 such families and a molecular diagnosis was made in 13; a success rate of 46%. In 11 families, we identified mutations in genes associated with known neurological syndromes and in two we identified novel disease genes. Exome analysis of sib pairs and/or patients born to consanguineous parents was more likely to be successful (9/13) than simplex cases (4/15). Our data suggest that exome sequencing is an effective first line test for pediatric patients with ataxia where a specific single gene is not immediately suspected to be causative.

Therefore, the safety of helicopter platforms have attracted the attention of many researchers in the past two decades. In order to deal with these problems, this paper presents an overview of the recent development and current researches in the field of fault diagnosis, including analytical/model-based, signal processing-based and knowledge-based techniques, and also passive/active fault- tolerant control approaches. Among various helicopters, single-rotor aerial vehicles, i.e. manned helicopters, unmanned helicopters, two and three degree-of-freedom unmanned helicopter experimental platforms, are considered for providing an overall picture of the fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control approaches based on the review of journal articles in last two decades, conference articles in last several years and some books.

QUALITE Grp	Outcomes Trajectories in Children With Epilepsy: Hypotheses and Methodology of a Canadian Longitudinal Observational Study	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						childhood epilepsy; health outcomes; health-related quality of life (HRQOL); participation; conceptual framework of determinants; moderators and mediators; psychosocial adjustment; self and proxy reports	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; HEALTH; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; DISABILITY; ADJUSTMENT; VALIDATION; MODERATORS; DISORDERS; MEDIATORS	BACKGROUND: The impact of childhood epilepsy can only be appreciated by understanding that epilepsy comprises a set of complex neurobehavioral conditions with significant social consequences, and not simply disorders of recurrent seizures. Our objective is to describe the hypotheses and methodology behind a large prospective longitudinal study that is based on a conceptual framework for understanding health outcomes. The study will quantify the specific influences direct, mediating or moderating that various epilepsy, comorbid, child, and family variables exert on health over the early life course. METHODS: The target population is 8- to 14-year-old children with epilepsy and their caregivers from across Canada. Children, caregivers, and health professionals are completing 17 measures at five visits over a 28-month period. We have selected measures based on content, the source of the items, psychometric properties, and provisions for child selfreport. Our cross-sectional and longitudinal design includes a relational model for structural equation modeling of specific biomedical and psychosocial variables with hierarchical direction of influence. To measure change over time, we will use hierarchical linear modeling. SIGNIFICANCE: This article reports the framework for interpreting future data. We believe that it will help researchers consider their methodology and encourage them to plan and execute longitudinal studies. Furthermore, the article will help clinical readers identify what to look for when evaluating outcomes research. It is our belief that the next generation of research to understand life-course effect in the lives of children and youth with chronic conditions and their families must occur over real time.

However, its exact role in modulating the schizophrenia phenotype is not known. Aims: To comprehensively investigate the relationship between rs9960767 risk allele (C) of TCF4 and cognitive performance in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP). Methods: 173 patients with FEP received a comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation and were genotyped for rs9960767. Carriers of the risk allele (CA/CC) were compared to non-carriers (AA) using Multivariate Analysis of Covariance MANCOVA. Ethnicity, negative symptoms and substance abuse were included as covariates. Results: Carriers of the risk allele had a statistically significant lower performance in the cognitive domain of Reasoning/Problem-Solving compared to non-carriers (F-1,F-172 = 4.4, p = .038). There were no significant genotype effects on the other cognitive domains or general cognition. This effect on the Reasoning/Problem-Solving domain remained significant even when controlling for IQ (F-1,F-172 = 4.3, p = .039). Conclusions: rs9960767 (C) of TCF4 appears to be associated with neurocognitive deficits in the Reasoning/Problem-Solving cognitive domain, in patients with FEP. A confirmation of this finding in a larger sample and including other TCF4 polymorphisms will be needed to gain further validity of this result. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While some evidence suggests that the decline in cognition occurs over the untreated symptomatic period, including the prodromal phase, others point to these deficits being present even earlier. We aimed to investigate the differential effect of untreated symptomatic and pre-morbid phases on cognition in a large sample of FEP. Methods: Two hundred and sixty eight FEP patients, admitted into a specialized early intervention service, were administered neuro-cognitive tests. The Circumstances of Onset and Relapse Schedule (CORS) was administered for measurement of duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), the duration of untreated illness (DUI) and demographic factors. The Pre-morbid Adjustment Scale (PAS) was used to measure different domains of pre-morbid adjustment. Seventy three healthy controls were also recruited for neuro-cognitive comparison. Results: We observed no effect of DUP and a minimal effect of DUI on cognitive functioning in FEP. Instead, the early educational pre-morbid adjustment domain was most strongly associated with cognition and predicted both global cognitive and verbal memory outcome in FEP. Conclusion: Our results suggest that symptoms associated with the symptomatic phase of a FEP do not influence cognitive functioning in FEP. Instead, cognitive deficits in FEP may predate illness onset and may indicate susceptibility to such illness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In fact, stress appears to be increasingly present in our modern, and demanding, industrialized society. Virtually every aspect of our body and brain can be influenced by stress and although its effects are partly mediated by powerful corticosteroid hormones that target the nervous system, relatively little is known about when, and how, the effects of stress shift from being beneficial and protective to becoming deleterious. Decades of stress research have provided valuable insights into whether stress can directly induce dysfunction and/or pathological alterations, which elements of stress exposure are responsible, and which structural substrates are involved. Using a broad definition of pathology, we here review the "neuropathology of stress" and focus on structural consequences of stress exposure for different regions of the rodent, primate and human brain. We discuss cytoarchitectural, neuropathological and structural plasticity measures as well as more recent neuroimaging techniques that allow direct monitoring of the spatiotemporal effects of stress and the role of different CNS structures in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in human brain. We focus on the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, key brain regions that not only modulate emotions and cognition but also the response to stress itself, and discuss disorders like depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, Cushing syndrome and dementia.

Osteolysis and pain due to experimental bone metastases are improved by treatment with rapamycin	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT			English	Article						Breast cancer metastases; Tibial injection model; 4T1; Rapamycin; mTOR; Pamidronate	BREAST-CANCER METASTASIS; PHASE-I TRIAL; MAMMALIAN TARGET; ZOLEDRONIC ACID; MURINE MODEL; SPINAL-CORD; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; ANIMAL-MODELS; RAT MODEL; COMBINATION	In advanced breast cancer, bone metastases occur in 70 % of patients. Managing the devastating pain associated with the disease is difficult. Rapamycin is an immunomodulatory drug that targets the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Rapamycin has been shown to decrease osteolysis associated with metastatic breast cancer in pre-clinical models and to reduce pain in inflammatory and neuropathic models. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rapamycin in reducing pain associated with experimental osteolytic metastases. Bone cancer was induced by intra-tibial injections of murine mammary carcinoma cells (4T1) in immunocompetent BALB/c mice and treated intraperitoneally for up to 5 weeks with vehicle, rapamycin or pamidronate (a bisphosphonate currently used to reduce bone loss in bone cancer patients). The control group received intra-tibial injection with saline (sham) and was treated with vehicle intraperitoneally. Cancer-induced osteolysis was observed histologically and radiographically 2-3 weeks following cancer inoculation and gradually increased with time. Measures of evoked nociceptive behaviors including sensitivity to mechanical, thermal, and cold stimuli and spontaneous nociceptive behaviors (limping, guarding) were evaluated. Significant hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli developed in cancer-bearing mice compared to sham 3 weeks following inoculation. Rapamycin decreased or delayed the development of cancer-induced mechanical, heat, and cold hypersensitivity, while pamidronate reduced heat and cold hypersensitivity. Both rapamycin and pamidronate had a partial protective effect on the spontaneous nociceptive behaviors, limping and guarding. Our data suggest that rapamycin may have efficacy in the management of pain associated with metastatic breast cancer.

We sought to investigate whether an immediate allergic reaction that induces nasal inflammation is also able to induce changes in levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in nasal lavage (NAL) fluid from patients with allergic OR. MethodsTen patients sensitized to flour underwent control and active specific inhalation challenge (SIC) on consecutive days. Nasal response to SIC was monitored with acoustic rhinometry and symptoms recording. NAL was performed before and 30 minutes, 6 hours, and 24 hours after control and active challenge for the assessment of levels of BDNF and inflammatory cells in NAL fluid. ResultsIn contrast to control day, flour challenge induced immediate clinical reactions in all subjects. After flour challenge, a significant increase in levels of BDNF in NAL fluid was observed at 6 hours after challenge (p < 0.05). Also, a significant increase in the number of eosinophils in NAL fluid at 30 minutes (p < 0.01), 6 hours (p < 0.01), and 24 hours (p= 0.05) postchallenge was observed. Also, levels of BDNF in NAL fluid were significantly higher at 30 minutes after flour challenge (p= 0.02) in comparison to levels on the control day at the same postchallenge time. A marginally significant positive correlation between BDNF levels and eosinophil counts at 30 minutes (r= 0.60, p= 0.06) and at 6 hours (r= 0.50, p= 0.08) after flour challenge was noted. ConclusionWe showed that BDNF is released in nasal fluid after SIC with flour. Results support the suggestion that neurotrophins may play a role in the pathogenesis of allergic OR.

METHODSWe examined the roles of the cerebellum and striatum in predictive motor timing during a target interception task in healthy individuals (HC group; n = 21) and in patients with early Parkinson's disease (early stage PD group; n = 20) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTSDespite having similar hit ratios, the PD failed more often than the HC to postpone their actions until the right moment and to adapt their behavior from one trial to the next. We found more activation in the right cerebellar lobule VI in HC than in early stage PD during successful trials. Successful trial-by-trial adjustments were associated with higher activity in the right putamen and lobule VI of the cerebellum in HC. CONCLUSIONSWe conclude that both the cerebellum and striatum are involved in predictive motor timing tasks. The cerebellar activity is associated exclusively with the postponement of action until the right moment, whereas both the cerebellum and striatum are needed for successful adaptation of motor actions from one trial to the next. We found a general hypoactivation'' of basal ganglia and cerebellum in early stage PD relative to HC, indicating that even in early stages of the PD there could be functional perturbations in the motor system beyond striatum.

Opioid receptor mu 1 gene, fat intake and obesity in adolescence	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						opioid receptor mu 1 gene; fat intake; obesity and amygdala	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCUS; FOOD-INTAKE; DIETARY-FAT; AMYGDALA VOLUME; JEAN QUEBEC; BRAIN; BODY; RATS; HUMANS; MAPS	Dietary preference for fat may increase risk for obesity. It is a complex behavior regulated in part by the amygdala, a brain structure involved in reward processing and food behavior, and modulated by genetic factors. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to search for gene loci associated with dietary intake of fat, and we tested whether these loci are also associated with adiposity and amygdala volume. We studied 598 adolescents (12-18 years) recruited from the French-Canadian founder population and genotyped them with 530 011 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Fat intake was assessed with a 24-hour food recall. Adiposity was examined with anthropometry and bioimpedance. Amygdala volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. GWAS identified a locus of fat intake in the m-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1, rs2281617, P = 5.2 x 10(-6)), which encodes a receptor expressed in the brain-reward system and shown previously to modulate fat preference in animals. The minor OPRM1 allele appeared to have a 'protective' effect: it was associated with lower fat intake (by 4%) and lower body-fat mass (by similar to 2 kg, P = 0.02). Consistent with the possible amygdala-mediated inhibition of fat preference, this allele was additionally associated with higher amygdala volume (by 69 mm(3), P = 0.02) and, in the carriers of this allele, amygdala volume correlated inversely with fat intake (P = 0.02). Finally, OPRM1 was associated with fat intake in an independent sample of 490 young adults. In summary, OPRM1 may modulate dietary intake of fat and hence risk for obesity, and this effect may be modulated by subtle variations in the amygdala volume.	[Haghighi, A.; Melka, M.

Structural and functional analysis of single neurons to correlate synaptic connectivity with grooming behavior	NATURE PROTOCOLS			English	Article							DOWN-SYNDROME; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SENSORY NEURONS; DROSOPHILA; SPECIFICITY; MECHANISMS; IMBALANCE; MUTATION; PROTEIN; REGION	We describe a protocol to image the complex axonal branching structure of identified mechanosensory neurons in Drosophila, combined with a behavioral assay to evaluate the functional output of the neuron. The stimulation of identified mechanosensory neurons in live animals produces a stereotyped grooming reflex. The mechanosensory axonal arbor within the CNSCNSCNS is subsequently labeled with a lipophilic fluorescent dye and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. The behavioral output can therefore be correlated to the axonal morphology of the stimulated neuron in the same animal. Combining this protocol with genetic analysis provides a powerful tool for identifying the roles of molecules involved in different aspects of hard-wired neural circuit formation underlying an innate behavior. From behavioral analysis to axonal imaging, the protocol takes 4 d.

Long-term Visual Outcome of Methylmalonic Aciduria and Homocystinuria, Cobalamin C Type	OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							CLINICAL HETEROGENEITY; CBLC DISORDER; DEGENERATION; SPECTRUM; DEFECT	Objective: To describe the long-term ophthalmologic outcomes of patients with methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria, cobalamin C type (cblC). Design: Retrospective case series. Participants: All patients with cblC referred to the Department of Ophthalmology of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine from 1984 through 2012 were studied. Twelve such patients were identified. Methods: Clinical ophthalmic examinations, neuroimaging, electroretinography, and the results of MMACHC mutation analysis were reviewed retrospectively. Main Outcome Measures: We examined visual acuity, ocular alignment, presence of maculopathy and peripheral retinopathy, optic atrophy, and nystagmus. Photopic and scotopic electroretinograms were reviewed. We examined and compared mutations in the MMACHC gene. Neuroimaging abnormalities were compiled when available. Results: Twelve cblC patients were followed up from 2 to 23 years (average, 10 years). Eleven of 12 patients were diagnosed before the age of 1 year (range, birth - 2 years). An initial ophthalmic examination was performed within the first year of age in 9 of 12 patients. Visual acuity at the time of presentation was variable, ranging from light perception to 20/20. Visual acuity was worse than 20/100 in 75% (9/12) of patients at last follow-up. Eight patients (67%) had obvious maculopathy on fundus examination. Other findings included peripheral retinopathy (8/12 [67%]), nystagmus (8/12 [67%]), strabismus (5/12 [42%]), and optic atrophy (6/12 [50%]). Funduscopic deterioration was documented in 1 patient, whereas electrophysiologic changes occurred in 4 patients. Neuroimaging results were available in 7 of the patients, revealing corpus callosum atrophy (7/7 [100%]) and periventricular white matter loss (6/7 [85%]). Conclusions: Most children in our series had early-onset disease with neurologic manifestations and abnormal ophthalmologic examination results. Despite early treatment, many early-onset cblC patients have poor visual function. (C) 2014 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Cardiac thromboembolic sources are an important potential cause of stroke. Left atrial appendage (LAA) thromboembolism in association with atrial fibrillation is a major contributor to stroke occurrence, particularly in elderly individuals. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) acts as a potential conduit from the right-sided circulation to the brain, and has been suggested to be an important factor in cryptogenic stroke in the young patients. Advances in interventional cardiology have made it possible to deal with these potential stroke sources (LAA and PFO), but the available methods have intrinsic limitations that must be recognized. Furthermore, the potential value of LAA and PFO closure depends on our ability to identify when the target structure is importantly involved in stroke risk; this is particularly challenging for PFO. This article addresses the clinical use of PFO and LAA closure in stroke prevention. We discuss technical aspects of closure devices and methods, questions of patient selection, and clinical trials evidence. We conclude that for PFO closure, the clinical trials evidence is thus far negative in the broad cryptogenic stroke population, but closure might nevertheless be indicated for selected high-risk patients. LAA closure has an acceptable balance between safety and efficacy for atrial fibrillation patients with high stroke risk and important contraindications to oral anticoagulation. Much more work needs to be done to optimize the devices and techniques, and better define patient selection for these potentially valuable procedures.

Development of additional pituitary hormone deficiencies in pediatric patients originally diagnosed with idiopathic isolated GH deficiency	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							GROWTH-HORMONE; SHORT STATURE; HYPOPITUITARY PATIENTS; CENTRAL HYPOTHYROIDISM; THYROID AXIS; CHILDREN; REPLACEMENT	Objective: We assessed the characteristics of children initially diagnosed with idiopathic isolated GH deficiency (IGHD) who later developed additional (multiple) pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHD). Design: Data were analyzed for 5805 pediatric patients with idiopathic IGHD, who were GH-naive at baseline and GH-treated in the multinational, observational Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study. Methods: Development of MPHD was assessed from investigator diagnoses, adverse events, and concomitant medications. Analyses were performed for all patients and for those who developed MPHD within 4.5 years or had >= 3.5 years, follow-up and continued to have IGHD (4-year cohort). Results: MPHD developed in 118/5805 (2.0%) children overall, and in 96/1757 (5.5%) in the 4-year cohort. Patients who developed MPHD had more profound GHD, with decreased height SDS, IGF1 SDS and peak stimulated GH, and greater height decrement vs target, compared with children who continued to have IGHD (P<0.001 for each variable). Delivery complications, congenital anomalies, and perinatal/neonatal adverse events occurred more frequently in patients who developed MPHD. The most frequent additional deficiency was TSH (82 patients overall); four patients developed two pituitary hormone deficiencies and one developed three deficiencies. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that years of follow-up (odds ratio 1.55), baseline age (1.17), baseline height SDS (0.69), and peak stimulated GH (0.64) were associated with the development of MPHD. Conclusions: MPHD is more likely to develop in patients with more severe idiopathic IGHD. Older baseline age, lower baseline height SDS, and longer follow-up duration are associated with increased risk of development of MPHD.

Methods: We describe a patient with an unusual phenotypic presentation of gross motor delay, childhood-onset erythromelalgia, extreme visceral pain episodes, hypesthesia, and self-mutilation. The investigation of the patient's motor delay included various biochemical analyses, a comparative genomic hybridization array (CGH), electromyogram (EMG), and muscle biopsy. Once erythromelalgia was suspected clinically, the SCN9A gene was sequenced. Results: The EMG, CGH, and biochemical tests were negative. The biopsy showed an axonal neuropathy and neurogenic atrophy. Sequencing of SCN9A revealed a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 7; p.I234T. Conclusions: This is a case of global motor delay and erythromelalgia associated with SCN9A. The motor delay may be attributed to the extreme pain episodes or to a developmental perturbation of proprioceptive inputs.

We performed integrated genetic and epigenetic analyses of 12 ETMR samples and identified, in all cases, C19MC fusions to TTYH1 driving expression of the microRNAs. ETMR tumors, cell lines and xenografts showed a specific DNA methylation pattern distinct from those of other tumors and normal tissues. We detected extreme overexpression of a previously uncharacterized isoform of DNMT3B originating at an alternative promoter(3) that is active only in the first weeks of neural tube development. Transcriptional and immunohistochemical analyses suggest that C19MC-dependent DNMT3B deregulation is mediated by RBL2, a known repressor of DNMT3B(4,5). Transfection with individual C19MC microRNAs resulted in DNMT3B upregulation and RBL2 downregulation in cultured cells. Our data suggest a potential oncogenic re-engagement of an early developmental program in ETMR via epigenetic alteration mediated by an embryonic, brain-specific DNMT3B isoform.

Identification of a unique TGF-beta dependent molecular and functional signature in microglia	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; EPIDERMAL LANGERHANS CELLS; MYELOID CELLS; TRANSFORMING GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA-1; TISSUE MACROPHAGES; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; ADULT MICROGLIA; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MOUSE-BRAIN; STEM-CELLS	Microglia are myeloid cells of the CNS that participate both in normal CNS function and in disease. We investigated the molecular signature of microglia and identified 239 genes and 8 microRNAs that were uniquely or highly expressed in microglia versus myeloid and other immune cells. Of the 239 genes, 106 were enriched in microglia as compared with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. This microglia signature was not observed in microglial lines or in monocytes recruited to the CNS, and was also observed in human microglia. We found that TGF-beta was required for the in vitro development of microglia that express the microglial molecular signature characteristic of adult microglia and that microglia were absent in the CNS of TGF-beta 1 deficient mice. Our results identify a unique microglial signature that is dependent on TGF-beta signaling and provide insights into microglial biology and the possibility of targeting microglia for the treatment of CNS disease.

Nevertheless, in some healthy individuals, significant decreases or increases in IQ have been observed over time. It is unclear whether such changes reflect true functional change or merely measurement error. Here, we applied surface-based corticometry to investigate vertex-wise cortical surface area and thickness correlates of changes in Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), Performance IQ (Pip) and Verbal IQ (VIQ) in a representative sample of children and adolescents (n = 188, mean age = 11.59 years) assessed two years apart as part of the NIH Study of Normal Brain Development. No significant associations between changes in IQ measures and changes in cortical surface area were observed, whereas changes in FSIQ, PIQ and VIQ were related to rates of cortical thinning, mainly in left frontal areas. Participants who showed reliable gains in FSIQ showed no significant changes in cortical thickness on average, whereas those who exhibited no significant FSIQ change showed moderate declines in cortical thickness. Importantly, individuals who showed large decreases in FSIQ displayed the steepest and most significant reductions in cortical thickness. Results support the view that there can be meaningful cognitive ability changes that impact IQ within relatively short developmental periods and show that such changes are associated with the dynamics of cortical thickness development.

This meeting was attended by a small group of invited experts spanning all aspects of spinal cord imaging from basic research to clinical practice. The greatest current challenges for spinal cord imaging were identified as arising from the imaging environment itself; difficult imaging environment created by the bone surrounding the spinal canal, physiological motion of the cord and adjacent tissues, and small cross-sectional dimensions of the spinal cord, exacerbated by metallic implants often present in injured patients. Challenges were also identified as a result of a lack of "critical mass" of researchers taking on the development of spinal cord imaging, affecting both the rate of progress in the field, and the demand for equipment and software to manufacturers to produce the necessary tools. Here we define the current state-of-the-art of spinal cord imaging, discuss the underlying theory and challenges, and present the evidence for the current and potential power of these methods. In two review papers (part I and part II), we propose-that the challenges can be overcome with advances in methods, improving availability and effectiveness of methods, and linking existing researchers to create the necessary scientific and clinical network to advance the rate of progress and impact of the research.

However, high increases of cell viability and poor control of cell differentiation remain major obstacles. In this study, we have developed a non-woven material made of co-electrospun fibers of poly L-lactic acid and gelatin with a degradation rate and mechanical properties similar to peripheral nerve tissue and investigated their effect on cell survival and differentiation into motor neuronal lineages through the controlled release of retinoic acid (RA) and purmorphamine. Engineered Neural Stem-Like Cells (NSLCs) seeded on these fibers, with and without the instructive cues, differentiated into beta-III-tubulin, HB-9, Islet-1, and choactase-positive motor neurons by immunostaining, in response to the release of the biomolecules. In addition, the bioactive material not only enhanced the differentiation into motor neuronal lineages but also promoted neurite outgrowth. This study elucidated that a combination of electrospun fiber scaffolds, neural stem cells, and controlled delivery of instructive cues could lead to the development of a better strategy for peripheral nerve injury repair.

A versatile method to study cell response to a protein consists of patterning the protein cue on a substrate and quantifying the distribution of cells between patterned and non-patterned areas. Here, we define the concepts of (i) cell-surface affinity to describe cell choices, and of (ii) reference surface (RS) to clarify that the choice is made relative to a reference. Furthermore, we report a method to systematically tune the RS and show that it can dominate the experimental cell response to a protein cue. The cell response to a cue can be switched from strong preference to strong aversion by only changing the RS. Using microcontact printing, we patterned the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin or netrin-1 adjacent to a series of RSs with different ratios of poly-D-lysine (PDL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), which are of high affinity and of low-affinity for cells, respectively. C2C12 myoblasts or primary neurons seeded on substrates with a high affinity RS (high % PDL) did not respond to a printed protein of interest, and conversely on RSs of low affinity (high % PEG) the cells preferred the printed protein even in the absence of a specific interaction. However, when testing cell response to a standardized series of RSs varying from high to low affinity, a specific response curve was obtained that was unique to each cell type-protein pair. Importantly, for intermediate RSs with moderate affinity, the cell response to the cue was dependent on the activation of biologically relevant protein-specific biochemical signal transduction pathways. Our results establish that choices made by cells in response to a surface-bound cue must take into account, and be interpreted in the context of, the RS. The use of a series of RSs with varying cell-surface affinity reveals specific response curves of cells to a cue that can be compared quantitatively and that may help gain new insights into cellular responses to extracellular proteins.

Recent literature has demonstrated that changes in energy status can profoundly affect the fever response to an acute immune challenge. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the exacerbating effect of diet induced obesity (DID) on the LPS-induced fever response demonstrated previously would generalize to other sickness behaviors and, further, whether incremental changes in body weight would influence these responses. Results showed that DID male Wistar rats exhibited a higher number of sickness symptoms for a longer period after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection (100 mu g/kg) than lean rats. Similarly, they showed a more prolonged fever and a delayed recovery from LPS-induced suppression of social interaction. No difference in locomotor activity was observed between obese and lean groups. Comparisons among groups that varied in body weight showed that an 11% increase in body weight was sufficient to increase the number and duration of sickness symptoms displayed after an LPS-injection and that the severity of sickness symptoms increased with increasing body weight. Together these data suggest that DIO can have profound effects on multiple behavioral responses to an acute immune challenge placing obese organisms at higher risk of the consequences of prolonged inflammation.

Patients with mastocytosis display high level of negative emotionality such as depression and stress sensibility. Brain mast cells are mainly localized in the diencephalon, which is linked to emotion regulatory systems. Negative emotionality has been shown to be associated with telomere shortening. Taken together these observations led us to hypothesize that mast cells activity could be involved in both negative emotionality and telomere shortening in mastocytosis. Objective: To demonstrate a possible relationship between negative emotionality in mastocytosis and leukocytes telomere length. Methods: Leukocyte telomere length and telomerase activity were measured among mastocytosis patients and were correlated with perceived stress and depression assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory revised and the Perceived Stress Scale. Results: Mild-severe depression scores were frequent (78.9%) as well as high perceived stress (42.11%). Telomere length was correlated to perceived stress (r = 0.77; p = 0.0001) but not to depression in our population. Patients displaying Wild-type KIT significantly presented higher perceived stress levels. Patients with the D816VC KIT mutation who had high perceived stress scores displayed significantly shorter telomere but not if they had high depression scores. Conclusion: These findings suggest that high perceived stress in mastocytosis could accelerate the rate of leukocytes telomere shortening. Since mastocytosis is, by definition, a mast cell mediated disease; these cells could be involved in this phenomenon. Mechanistic causal relationships between these parameters need to be investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A weight index (extrinsic fraction of labeled neurons [FLNe]) was determined for each area-to-area pathway. Newly found projections were weaker on average compared with the known projections; nevertheless, the 2 sets of pathways had extensively overlapping weight distributions. Repeat injections across individuals revealed modest FLNe variability given the range of FLNe values (standard deviation <1 log unit, range 5 log units). The connectivity profile for each area conformed to a lognormal distribution, where a majority of projections are moderate or weak in strength. In the G(29 x) (29) interareal subgraph, two-thirds of the connections that can exist do exist. Analysis of the smallest set of areas that collects links from all 91 nodes of the G(29 x 91) subgraph (dominating set analysis) confirms the dense (66%) structure of the cortical matrix. The G(29 x 29) subgraph suggests an unexpectedly high incidence of unidirectional links. The directed and weighted G(29 x 91) connectivity matrix for the macaque will be valuable for comparison with connectivity analyses in other species, including humans. It will also inform future modeling studies that explore the regularities of cortical networks.	[Markov, N. T.; Gomes, A. R.

This 'synaptic autism pathway' notably includes disruption of SYN1 that is associated with epilepsy, autism and abnormal behavior in both human and mice models. Synapsins constitute a multigene family of neuron-specific phosphoproteins (SYN1-3) present in the majority of synapses where they are implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis. Synapsins I and II, the major Syn isoforms in the adult brain, display partially overlapping functions and defects in both isoforms are associated with epilepsy and autistic-like behavior in mice. In this study, we show that nonsense (A94fs199X) and missense (Y236S and G464R) mutations in SYN2 are associated with ASD in humans. The phenotype is apparent in males. Female carriers of SYN2 mutations are unaffected, suggesting that SYN2 is another example of autosomal sex-limited expression in ASD. When expressed in SYN2 knockout neurons, wild-type human Syn II fully rescues the SYN2 knockout phenotype, whereas the nonsense mutant is not expressed and the missense mutants are virtually unable to modify the SYN2 knockout phenotype. These results identify for the first time SYN2 as a novel predisposing gene for ASD and strengthen the hypothesis that a disturbance of synaptic homeostasis underlies ASD.

We aimed to determine whether disaster-related PNMS predicts motor functioning in young children and whether timing of exposure and sex of the child moderate these effects. Objective and subjective PNMS levels were assessed among pregnant women exposed to a natural disaster. Their children's bilateral coordination, balance, and visual motor integration (VMI) were assessed at 51/2 years. Girls performed better than boys. Objective stress exposure and subjective distress interacted such that when subjective distress was high, no added effect of objective hardship was observed; when subjective distress was low, objective hardship showed a negative effect. In girls, late pregnancy exposure was associated with poorer outcomes. In conclusion, disaster-related PNMS is associated with relatively lower motor functions in exposed offspring. Exposure timing, sex, and type of stress influenced the effects. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 56: 117-125, 2014.

The development of improved loss functions and regularization approaches have resulted in consistent reductions in ASR word error rates (WERs). This paper presents a manifold learning based regularization framework for DNN training. The associated techniques attempt to preserve the underlying low dimensional manifold based relationships amongst speech feature vectors as part of the optimization procedure for estimating network parameters. This is achieved by imposing manifold based locality preserving constraints on the outputs of the network. The techniques are presented in the context of a bottleneck DNN architecture for feature extraction in a tandem configuration. The ASR WER obtained using these networks is evaluated on a speech-in-noise task and compared to that obtained using DNN-bottleneck networks trained without manifold constraints.

The high-order neural network (HONN) is known for its simple structure and powerful nonlinearity approximation property, which make it more suitable for modeling the singularly perturbed nonlinear systems than the multi-layer neural network [10]. An on-line identification scheme optimal bounded ellipsoid (OBE) algorithm is developed for the recurrent high order neural network (RHONN) model. By adaptively changing the learning rate, the on-line identification scheme can achieve faster convergence compared to the other widely used learning schemes, such as backpropagation. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we investigate the application of this framework to unconstrained whiteboard notes, taking into account a novel acquisition modality, multiple writers, natural language, and complete text lines. Although these conditions deviate strongly from the previously considered scenario of brief pen movements on tablet computers, we demonstrate that the Sigma-Lognormal model is still able to represent the handwriting accurately. In order to deal with longer handwriting patterns, we propose a robust component-wise representation of text lines that achieves a high model quality. Furthermore, we propose a stroke-wise distortion method to generate synthetic text lines from the Sigma-Lognormal representation of real specimens. For handwriting recognition on the JAM online database, it is demonstrated that the extension of the training set with the proposed synthesis method significantly increases current benchmark results achieved with recurrent neural networks.

A recurrent neural network based sequential text recognition system is used at first to provide the N-best recognition hypotheses of word images. Word hypotheses are aligned with the word image to obtain the character boundaries. Then, a verification approach using a DBN classifier is performed for each character segments. DBNs are recently proved to be very effective for a variety of machine learning problems. The character probabilities obtained from DBNs are next combined with the base recognition system. Finally, the N-best recognition hypotheses list is reranked according to the new score. We have compared our proposed approach with an MLP based rescoring approach on the Rimes dataset The results obtained show that the verification approach using DBNs outperforms that of MLP systems.

Most companies use the Kirk-patrick/Phillips model to evaluate enterprise training. However, it emerges from the literature that enterprises have difficulties in using this model. There are three main barriers to the evaluation of training. The first barrier is the difficulty of isolating learning as a factor that affects the results. Another barrier is the lack of a useful IT assessment tool with the learning management system and the third barrier is the lack of standardized data to compare various learning functions. This paper presents an efficient Web-based Platform: ETREOSys - Enterprise TRaining program Evaluation and Optimization System. ETREOSys is a Web platform which uses cloud services such as virtual machines, data centers, Content Delivery Network and NoSQL databases. It allows training project monitoring as well as the calculation of tangible and intangible benefits of training without added cost. Furthermore, it enables the production of a classification of training projects according to criteria relevant to the enterprise. Our platform can optimize the training yield by a series of simulations based on machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, neural network and cotraining.

Employing error-correcting code principles in these devices has allowed to greatly enhance their performance. In this paper we reintroduce a neural-based model using the formalism of linear algebra and extend its functionality, originally limited to erasure retrieval, to handle approximate inputs. In order to perform the retrieval, we use an iterative algorithm that provably converges. We then analyze the performance of the associative memory under the assumption of connection independence. We support our theoretical results with numerical simulations.
