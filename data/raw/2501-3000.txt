There are substantial adverse impacts on society when power grids fail such as disruption to traffic and shut down in the operation of other critical infrastructure elements. This paper presents a novel method to assist in forecasting the probability of power outage based on weather condition in four Canadian provinces-Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. System disturbances reports, provided by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) from 1992 to 2009, have been scrutinized to determine the conditions that lead to power outage. Based on the reports above, weather condition is found to be a major cause behind power outage that justifies the necessity of a comprehensive study in this area. As a result, a forecasting model for power failure based on weather conditions is developed by artificial neural network (ANN). Once the prototype model is trained, it is able to predict the probability of power outage occurrences by utilizing forecasted weather data for a specific location. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate the applicability and accuracy of the developed method.

Pharmacologic modulation of S1PR expression on lymphocytes inhibits these cells capacity to respond to the S1P gradient within regional lymph nodes (LNs) (and thymus) that promotes their exit into peripheral circulation. The resultant peripheral blood restricted lymphopenia is considered to underlie the capacity of S1PR modulators to reduce new inflammatory lesion formation in MS in the absence of global immune suppression. These modulators also regulate entry of selective lymphocyte populations and dendritic cells (DCs) into LNs and modulate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) cell signaling networks that govern the generation of specific cell subsets within LNs. S1PR modulators that access the CNS can also have functional effects within this compartment since S1PRs are expressed by cells comprising the blood brain barrier (BBB) and by those within the parenchyma, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. Absence of S1P1 receptor (S1PR1) on astrocytes reduces disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Even under conditions that inhibit cell responses to the natural ligand, S1PR modulators can continue to induce active signaling responses; such responses may be relevant for promoting neuroprotection and augmenting tissue repair within the CNS.

This study examines the relationship between library anxiety and personality in graduate students at the master's level. Students from various disciplines in both research and course-based programs were administered the Library Anxiety Scale and the Big Five Inventory. A multiple linear regression was performed to predict library anxiety as a function of the five personality dimensions. The findings showed that Agreeableness and Conscientiousness together explained more than 35% of the variability, while neither Neuroticism nor Extraversion explained any of the variability.

In this review, we summarize the latest findings on the role of nutrition and nutraceuticals, microbiome, obesity, soy, omega-3 fatty acids, and curcumin supplementation as key elements in modulating the efficacy of analgesic treatments, including opioids. These main topics were addressed during the first edition of the Study In Multidisciplinary Pain Research workshop: "FYD (Feed Your Destiny): Fighting Pain", held on April 7, 2016, in Rome, Italy, which was sponsored by a grant from the Italian Ministry of Instruction on "Nutraceuticals and Innovative Pharmacology". The take-home message of this workshop was the recognition that patients with chronic pain should undergo nutritional assessment and counseling, which should be initiated at the onset of treatment. Some foods and supplements used in personalized treatment will likely improve clinical outcomes of analgesic therapy and result in considerable improvement of patient compliance and quality of life. From our current perspective, the potential benefit of including nutrition in personalizing pain medicine is formidable and highly promising.

However, they are computationally expensive to train and difficult to parallelize. Recent work has shown that normalizing intermediate representations of neural networks can significantly improve convergence rates in feed-forward neural networks [1]. In particular, batch normalization, which uses mini-batch statistics to standardize features, was shown to significantly reduce training time. In this paper, we investigate how batch normalization can be applied to RNNs. We show for both a speech recognition task and language modeling that the way we apply batch normalization leads to a faster convergence of the training criterion but doesn't seem to improve the generalization performance.

Recently, more direct end-to-end methods have been investigated, in which neural architectures were trained to model sequences of characters [1, 2]. To our knowledge, all these approaches relied on Connectionist Temporal Classification [3] modules. We investigate an alternative method for sequence modelling based on an attention mechanism that allows a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to learn alignments between sequences of input frames and output labels. We show how this setup can be applied to LVCSR by integrating the decoding RNN with an n-gram language model and by speeding up its operation by constraining selections made by the attention mechanism and by reducing the source sequence lengths by pooling information over time. Recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-freeRNN-based approaches are reported for the Wall Street Journal corpus.

Typically, for speaker verification systems with varying vocal effort inputs, standard solutions such as feature mapping or addition of data during parameter estimation (training) and enrollment stages result in a trade-off between accuracy gains with whispered test data and accuracy losses (up to 70% in equal error rate, EER) with normal test data. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes two innovations. First, we show the complementarity of features derived from AM-FM models over conventional mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, thus signalling the importance of instantaneous phase information for whispered speech speaker verification. Next, two fusion schemes are explored: score-and feature-level fusion. Overall, we show that gains as high as 30% and 84% in EER can be achieved for normal and whispered speech, respectively, using feature-level fusion.

In this article, we explore the extent to which automatic facial analysis can inform on users' idiosyncrasies. Facial emotion from 88 university students playing an emotionally charged video game was used to explore the relationship between personality trait and facial emotion in human-computer interaction context. We observed multiple statistically significant correlations between users' personality dimensions and their emotions. One personality dimension was mostly related to emotions: emotionality. This paper contributes to the HCI literature by underlining the importance of taking into account users' personality traits in analyzing their emotional reactions to interfaces. Neuroadaptive interfaces using emotional reactions would perform better by also controlling for personality traits of their users and enhance user experience.

Our novel hypothesis is that the first and second formants allow the estimation of the jaw-tongue dynamics. Once the velocity is computed, it is approximated by the Sigma-Lognormal model whose parameters enable to distinguish between normal and pathological voices. Three types of pathologies are used to test the method: Laryngeal Diseases, Parkinson and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Preliminary results show that the novel features proposed are able to distinguish between parameters of normal and pathological voice. Moreover, it is also possible to discriminate between the three types of pathologies studied in this work.

Here we report an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm for detecting a hierarchy of auditory processes in a group of healthy individuals and patients with disorders of consciousness. Simple cortical responses to sounds were observed in all 16 patients; 7/16 (44%) patients exhibited markers of the differential processing of speech and noise; and 1 patient produced evidence of the semantic processing of speech (i.e. the N400 effect). In several patients, the level of auditory processing that was evident from ERPs was higher than the abilities that were evident from behavioural assessment, indicating a greater sensitivity of ERPs in some cases. However, there were no differences in auditory processing between VS and MCS patient groups, indicating a lack of diagnostic specificity for this paradigm. Reliably detecting semantic processing by means of the N400 effect in passively listening single-subjects is a challenge.

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging traits as endophenotypes for genetic mapping in epilepsy	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Review						Endophenotypes; Epilepsy; Imaging genomics; Magnetic resonance imaging	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; JUVENILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; COMMON VARIANTS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN STRUCTURE; UNAFFECTED SIBLINGS	Over the last decade, the field of imaging genomics has combined high-throughput genotype data with quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (QMRI) measures to identify genes associated with brain structure, cognition, and several brain-related disorders. Despite its successful application in different psychiatric and neurological disorders, the field has yet to be advanced in epilepsy. In this article we examine the relevance of imaging genomics for future genetic studies in epilepsy from three perspectives. First, we discuss prior genome-wide genetic mapping efforts in epilepsy, considering the possibility that some studies may have been constrained by inherent theoretical and methodological limitations of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) method. Second, we offer a brief overview of the imaging genomics paradigm, from its original inception, to its role in the discovery of important risk genes in a number of brain-related disorders, and its successful application in large-scale multinational research networks. Third, we provide a comprehensive review of past studies that have explored the eligibility of brain QMRI traits as endophenotypes for epilepsy. While the breadth of studies exploring QMRI-derived endophenotypes in epilepsy remains narrow, robust syndrome-specific neuroanatomical QMRI traits have the potential to serve as accessible and relevant intermediate phenotypes for future genetic mapping efforts in epilepsy.

Influence of aerobic exercise training on the neural correlates of motor learning in Parkinson's disease individuals	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Exercise; Motor learning; fMRI	BASAL GANGLIA; TREADMILL EXERCISE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; BRAIN PLASTICITY; MOUSE MODEL; NEUROPLASTICITY; CEREBELLUM; COGNITION; RATS; NEUROGENESIS	Background: Aerobic exercise training (AET) has been shown to provide general health benefits, and to improve motor behaviours in particular, in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the influence of AET on their motor learning capacities, as well as the change in neural substrates mediating this effect remains to be explored. Objective: In the current study, we employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to assess the effect of a 3-month AET program on the neural correlates of implicit motor sequence learning (MSL). Methods: 20 healthy controls (HC) and 19 early PD individuals participated in a supervised, high-intensity, stationary recumbent bike training program (3 times/week for 12 weeks). Exercise prescription started at 20 min (+ 5 min/week up to 40 min) based on participant's maximal aerobic power. Before and after the AET program, participants' brain was scanned while performing an implicit version of the serial reaction time task. Results: Brain data revealed pre-post MSL-related increases in functional activity in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum in PD patients, as well as in the striatum in HC individuals. Importantly, the functional brain changes in PD individuals correlated with changes in aerobic fitness: a positive relationship was found with increased activity in the hippocampus and striatum, while a negative relationship was observed with the cerebellar activity. Conclusion: Our results reveal, for the first time, that exercise training produces functional changes in known motor learning related brain structures that are consistent with improved behavioural performance observed in PD patients. As such, AET can be a valuable non-pharmacological intervention to promote, not only physical fitness in early PD, but also better motor learning capacity useful in day-to-day activities through increased plasticity in motor related structures.

Twenty-five MS patients and 12 matched controls were recruited from the MS Clinic of the Montreal Neurological Institute. Anatomical and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) images were acquired using 3 Tesla MRI at baseline and two-year time-points. MTR maps were smoothed along meshes representing the inner, mid and outer neocortical boundaries. To evaluate csMTR reductions suggestive of sub-pial demyelination in MS patients, a mixed model analysis was carried out at both the individual vertex level and in anatomically parcellated brain regions. Our results demonstrate that focal areas of csMTR reduction are most prevalent along the outer cortical surface in the superior temporal and posterior cingulate cortices, as well as in the cuneus and precentral gyrus. Additionally, age regression analysis identified that reductions of csMTR in MS patients increase with age but appear to hit a plateau in the outer caudal anterior cingulate, as well as in the precentral and postcentral cortex. After correction for the naturally occurring gradient in cortical MTR, the difference in csMTR between the inner and outer cortex in focal areas in the brains of MS patients correlated with clinical disability. Overall, our findings support multi-surface analysis of csMTR as a sensitive marker of cortical sub-pial abnormality indicative of demyelination in MS patients. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We hypothesized that this dysconnectivity is underpinned by white matter abnormalities in the left arcuate fasciculus, the main fiber bundle connecting speech production and perception areas. We therefore investigated the relationship between AVH severity and the integrity of the arcuate fasciculus measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography in patients with schizophrenia. Thirty-eight patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia were included: 26 presented with daily severe treatment-resistant AVH, 12 reported prominent negative symptoms and no AVH. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured along the length of the left and right anterior arcuate fasciculi and severity of AVH was assessed using P3 PANSS item. FA values were significantly higher in the left arcuate fasciculus in patients with AVH than in no AVH patients (F-(1,F-35) = 3.86; p = 0.05). No difference was observed in the right arcuate fasciculus. There was a significant positive correlation between FA value in the left arcuate fasciculus and the severity of AVH (r = 0.36; p = 0.02). No correlation was observed between FA values and PANSS total score suggesting a specific relationship between AVH severity and the left arcuate fasciculus integrity. These results support the hypothesis of a relationship between left frontotemporal connectivity and AVH in patients with schizophrenia and suggest that whilst a disruption of frontotemporal connectivity might be present to ensure the emergence of AVH, more severe anatomical alterations may prevent the occurrence of AVH in patients with schizophrenia.

Based on the 2013 ASCE's report card, 21st century estimated to be the end of effective life for the majority of water distribution networks in the United States. It is essential to implement accurate and cost-effective models to estimate deterioration rates along with remaining useful life (RUL) of the pipelines to select and perform necessary intervention plans to prevent disastrous failures. This study aims to present a computational model to predict the RUL of water pipelines utilizing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Literature reveals that condition, length, diameter, and breakage rate are the most important factors in prediction of RUL. Based on the available data from the city of Montreal, the condition of pipelines is identified and used as the inputs for ANN model in addition to physical data. Since the model shows robustness and accuracy in estimating RUL, it can support municipality of Montreal in future planning.

The aim of the model is to provide brain-computer interfaces with improved cursor control without the need for a separate eye tracking device. To test the accuracy of the model "in-the-wild," an EEG dataset with (uncontrolled) natural saccades was used, where subjects looked freely at images on a screen. EEG data was input to deep neural networks, namely a multi-layer perceptron and a convolutional neural network. As benchmarks, two systems were explored using features measured from the Fp1/2 EEG channels, as well as from the AF7/8, F7/8, FT7/8, and T7/8 channels. Experimental results show the proposed system achieving an accuracy of 72.92%, thus outperforming all benchmarks, which achieved accuracies of 51.80% and 50.72%, respectively.

When e-noses are used in dynamic outdoor environment, the performance suffers from noise, signal drift and fast-changing natural environment. The question is, how to develop a prediction model capable of detecting as well as quantifying gases effectively and efficiently? The current research work has focused either on detection or quantification of sensor response without taking into account of dynamic factors. In this paper, we propose a new model, namely, Fuzzy Classification with Quantification Model (FCQM) to cope with the above mentioned challenges. To evaluate our model, we conducted extensive experiments on a publicly available datasets generated over a three-year period, and the results demonstrate its superiority over other baseline methods. To our knowledge, gas type detection together with quantification is an unsolved challenge. Our paper provides the first solution for this kind.

Neurorestorative treatments may be an alternative. This study investigated the effect of sildenafil on brain injury induced by neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) at term-equivalent age. Neonatal HI was induced in male LongEvans rat pups at postnatal day 10 (P10) by left common carotid ligation followed by a 2-hour exposure to 8% oxygen; sham-operated rat pups served as the control. Both groups were randomized to oral sildenafil or vehicle twice daily for 7 consecutive days. Gait analysis was performed on P27. At P30, the rats were sacrificed, and their brains were extracted. The surfaces of both hemispheres were measured on hematoxylin and eosin-stained brain sections. Mature neurons and endothelial cells were quantified near the infarct boundary zone using immunohistochemistry. HI caused significant gait impairment and a reduction in the size of the left hemisphere. Treatment with sildenafil led to an improvement in the neurological deficits as measured by gait analysis, as well as an improvement in the size of the left hemisphere. Sildenafil, especially at higher doses, also caused a significant increase in the number of neurons near the infarct boundary zone. In conclusion, sildenafil administered after neonatal HI may improve brain injury recovery by promoting neuronal populations. (C) 2016 S.

Firstly, by designing a high-gain observer to estimate the states of the system and cope with the uncertainties of the system, only the output of the control system is required to be measurable.

In this paper, we propose an intelligent system approach for defect prediction in oil and gas pipelines. The proposed technique is based on the magnetic flux leakage (MFL) technology widely used in pipeline monitoring systems. In the first stage, theMFL signals are analyzed using the-Wavelet transform technique to detect anymetal-loss defect in the targeted pipeline. In case of defect existence, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is utilized to predict the defect depth. Depth-related features are first extracted from theMFL signals, and then used to train the neural network to tune the parameters of the membership functions of the fuzzy inference system. To further improve the accuracy of the defect depth, predicted by the proposed model, highly-discriminant features are then selected by using the weight-based support vector machine (SVM). Experimental work shows that the proposed technique yields promising results, compared with those achieved by some service providers.

It was hypothesized that the echo envelope of radiofrequency signals of carotid arteries at 7.2 MHz is distributed locally according to homodyned K-distributions (HKD). Based on the statistical parameters of this distribution, two HKD parametric maps could be constructed, a first one related to the mean intensity and the second one related to the diffuse intensity SNR2, which is a novel feature in this context. The objective was to test if quantities extracted from such parametric maps, together with elastograms, could distinguish between non-vulnerable carotid artery plaques, and neovascularized or vulnerable ones, as assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. This novel combination of mean intensity, diffuse intensity SNR2, and elastogram, was quantitatively tested using a neural network with two hidden layers of 21 and 7 neurons, trained by minimizing weighted cross entropy, on plaques of 31 patients (12 non-vulnerable plaques, 19 neovascularized or vulnerable ones). Sensitivity and specificity were estimated with a bootstrap method. Classification based solely on elastograms yielded a specificity of 66.6% for a sensitivity of 82.7%. For the same sensitivity, the specificity was raised to 79.3% with the proposed combined method.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide. With the aging population it is expected that the prevalence of glaucoma will continue to increase. Despite recent advances in imaging and visual field testing techniques that allow establishment of earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation, significant numbers of glaucoma patients are undiagnosed and present late in the course of their disease. This can lead to irreversible vision loss, reduced quality of life, and a higher socioeconomic burden. Selection of therapeutic approaches for glaucoma should be based on careful ocular examination, patient medical history, presence of comorbidities, and awareness of concomitant systemic therapies. Therapy should also be individualized to patients' needs and preferences. Recent developments in this therapeutic field require revisiting treatment algorithms and integration of traditional and novel approaches in order to ensure optimal visual outcomes. This article provides an overview of recent developments and practice trends in the medical management of glaucoma in Canada. A discussion of the surgical management is beyond the scope of this paper.

Unlike most of the previous methods, the MIMO system under study is assumed to be in nonaffine form with unknown nonlinear functions in which the nonlinearities are completely coupled with system states and inputs. The system dynamics are first transformed into an affine form via mean value theorem. Then, a direct adaptive control strategy is developed by utilizing NNs universal approximation theory. In the proposed control scheme, the common assumption on fixing the NN hidden weights is removed. Hence, the suggested controller uses full approximation capabilities of NNs and is applicable to systems with higher degrees of nonlinearity. The tracking error and NN weights errors are ensured to be bounded via Lyapunov's direct method. Finally, experimental results are performed on a 6 degree of freedom (DoF) robotic system to illustrate performance of the proposed control scheme when applied to a completely unknown nonlinear system.

Autism is characterized by impairments in learning and communication, in social interaction, imaginative ability as well as in repetitive and restricted patterns of behavior [9]. This research contributes to the advancement of intelligent tutoring systems by proposing an affective intelligent tutoring system in the field of specialized education. We have conducted an experiment in mathematical learning with one controlled group of six participants who interacted without the support of the pedagogical agent Jessie, while the test group of six participants interacted with Jessie. The purpose of this study was to validate the support provided by the pedagogical agent Jessie based on our accompaniment model. The results showed significant improvement in learning by the test group.

Therefore, understanding such process is relevant for neuroscience and psychology. Methods: A systematic review was carried out using the terms Orgasm, Sexual Reward, Partner Preference, Pair Bonding, Brain, Learning, Sex, Copulation. Results: In humans, concentrations of arousing neurotransmitters and potential bonding neurotransmitters increase during orgasm in the cerebrospinal fluid and the bloodstream. Similarly, studies in animals indicate that those neurotransmitters (noradrenaline, oxytocin, prolactin) and others (e.g. dopamine, opioids, serotonin) modulate the appetitive and consummatory phases of sexual behavior and reward. This suggests a link between the experience of orgasm/sexual reward and the neurochemical mechanisms of pair bonding. Orgasm/reward functions as an unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Some areas in the nervous system function as UCS-detection centers, which become activated during orgasm. Partner-related cues function as conditioned stimuli (CS) and are processed in CS-detector centers. Conclusions: Throughout the article, we discuss how UCS-and CS-detection centers must interact to facilitate memory consolidation and produce recognition and motivation during future social encounters.

The question of whether animals experience orgasms is hampered by similar lack of definition and the additional necessity of making inferences from behavioral responses. Method: Here we define three behavioral criteria, based on dimensions of the subjective experience of human orgasms described by Mah and Binik, to infer orgasm-like responses (OLRs) in other species: 1) physiological criteria that include pelvic floor and analmuscle contractions that stimulate seminal emission and/or ejaculation in the male, or that stimulate uterine and cervical contractions in the female; 2) short-term behavioral changes that reflect immediate awareness of a pleasurable hedonic reward state during copulation; and 3) long-term behavioral changes that depend on the reward state induced by the OLR, including sexual satiety, the strengthening of patterns of sexual arousal and desire in subsequent copulations, and the generation of conditioned place and partner preferences for contextual and partner-related cues associated with the reward state. We then examine whether physiological and behavioral data from observations of male and female rats during copulation, and in sexually-conditioned place-and partner-preference paradigms, are consistent with these criteria. Results: Both male and female rats display behavioral patterns consistent with OLRs. Conclusions: The ability to infer OLRs in rats offers new possibilities to study the phenomenon in neurobiological and molecular detail, and to provide both comparative and translational perspectives that would be useful for both basic and clinical research.

Since the Victorian era, the pendulum has swung from the vagina to the clitoris, and to some extent back again, with the current debate stuck over whether internal sensory structures exist in the vagina that could account for orgasms based largely on their stimulation, or whether stimulation of the external glans clitoris is always necessary for orgasm. Method: We review the history of the clitoral versus vaginal orgasm debate as it has evolved with conflicting ideas and data from psychiatry and psychoanalysis, epidemiology, evolutionary theory, feminist political theory, physiology, and finally neuroscience. Results: A new synthesis is presented that acknowledges the enormous potential women have to experience orgasms from one or more sources of sensory input, including the external clitoral glans, internal region around the "G-spot" that corresponds to the internal clitoral bulbs, the cervix, as well as sensory stimulation of non-genital areas such as the nipples. Conclusions: With experience, stimulation of one or all of these triggering zones are integrated into a "whole" set of sensory inputs, movements, body positions, autonomic arousal, and partner-and contextual-related cues, that reliably induces pleasure and orgasm during masturbation and copulation. The process of integration is iterative and can change across the lifespan with new experiences of orgasm.

The design uses a fully differential difference amplifier (FDDA) to decrease the number of amplifiers in the control part, with reduced overall power consumption as a result. Moreover, this amplifier provides an output voltage swing that is almost twice that obtained with single-ended amplifiers. Finally, the two differential pairs at the FDDA input eliminate the need for impedance isolation buffers and matching resistors, consequently reducing system noise for improved sensitivity and accuracy. Designing this biosensor in 180 nm technology led to a current sensitivity of 900 fA, an input-referred noise of 6.9 mu Vrms and a power consumption of 53.9 mu W.

After each registration, the quality of the registration is reflected by the single global value: the final registration cost. Ideally, if the quality of the registration can be evaluated at each point, independent of the registration process, which also provides a direction in which the deformation can further be improved, the overall segmentation performance can be improved. We propose such a self-correcting multi-atlas segmentation method. The method is applied on hippocampus segmentation from brain images and statistically significantly improvement is observed.

Serum low-density lipoprotein levels, statin use, and cognition in patients with coronary artery disease	NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT			English	Article						cholesterol; visuospatial cognition; heart disease; psychopharmacology; adverse drug events	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS; IMPAIRMENT; RISK; POPULATION; DEMENTIA; MEMORY; METAANALYSIS; CHOLESTEROL; PERFORMANCE	Aim: Statins have been associated with decreased cognition due to the effects of low concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) on brain function. This has remained controversial and is particularly relevant to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), who have an increased risk of cognitive decline and are frequently prescribed statins. This study hypothesized that low concentration of LDL is associated with poor cognition in CAD patients using statins. It also explored the association between high-dose versus low-dose statins on cognition in this population. Patients and methods: Baseline cross-sectional data from a longitudinal study of 120 statin-using CAD patients were examined (mean statin duration 25 +/- 43 months). The main outcomes were measures of global cognition and cognitive domains, with poor cognition defined as cognitive performance <= 1 standard deviation below the population age and education adjusted means. A battery of cognitive tests was used to assess verbal memory, executive function, speed of processing, visuospatial memory, and global cognition. Adjusting for age, sex, education, and other covariates, multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed associations between low LDL levels (<1.5 mmol/L), statin use, and poor cognition. Results: LDL levels were not associated with global cognition or individual cognitive domains. High-dose statin use was associated with higher visuospatial memory (odds ratio, OR [95% confidence interval, CI] = 0.12 [0.02-0.66], P=0.01) and executive functioning (OR = 0.25 [0.06-0.99], P=0.05). This effect was independent of covariates such as LDL levels. Conclusion: Low LDL levels do not appear to be associated with poor cognition in CAD patients using statins. Whether high-dose statin use may have positive effects on cognition in CAD patients could be investigated in future studies.

The main contributions of this paper are twofold. a) Investigation of the predictability of facial micro-expressions from EEG. b) Identification of the relevant features to the prediction. To reach our objectives, an experiment was conducted and we have proceeded in three steps: i) We recorded facial expressions and the corresponding EEG signals of participant while he/she is looking at pictures stimuli from the IAPS (International Affective Picture System). ii) We fed machine learning algorithms with time-domain and frequency-domain features of one second EEG signals with also the corresponding facial expression data as ground truth in the training phase. iii) Using the trained classifiers, we predict facial emotional reactions without the need to a camera. Our method leads us to very promising results since we have reached high accuracy. It also provides an additional important result by locating which electrodes can be used to characterize specific emotion. This system will be particularly useful to evaluate emotional reactions in virtual reality environments where the user is wearing VR headset that hides the face and makes the traditional webcam facial expression detectors obsolete.

However, emotions can trigger some small changes in blood flow with an impact on skin temperature. In the present research we use EEG and a thermal camera to determine the emotional profile of a user submitted to a set of emotional pictures. Six experiments were performed to study the thermal reactions to emotions, and in each experiment, 80 selected standard stimuli pictures of 20 various emotional profiles from IAPS (a database of emotional images) were displayed to participants every three seconds. An infrared camera and EEG were used to capture both thermal pictures of participants and their electrical brain activities. We used several area of the face to train a classifier for emotion recognition using Machine Learning models. Results indicate that some specific areas are more significant than others to show a change in temperature. These changes are also slower than with the EEG signal. Two methods were used to train the HMM, one is training classifier per the participant self data (participant-independent), another is training classifier based on all participants thermal data (participant-dependent). The result showed the later method brings more accuracy emotion recognition.

Texture features are computed from local sub-volumes of T1-weighted MR images, and automatic classification performance is used to identify the (brain region, texture feature) combinations that are most discriminative regarding subject groups, i.e. AD vs healthy subjects. Experiments include MRI data of 124 subjects from the public OASIS database, three commonly-used texture feature types including the 3D-GLCM, 3D-DWT and LoG filters and random forest classification. The method identifies numerous (brain region, texture feature) combinations leading to high classification accuracy (> 70%), including several regions not traditionally linked to AD. These may indicate novel computational biomarkers for computer-assisted diagnosis or characterization of AD. The approach is generally applicable to other 3D data and disease contexts.

We draw inspiration from a state-of-the-art Fully-Convolutional Neural Network (F-CNN) architecture for semantic segmentation of objects in natural images, and adapt it to our task. Unlike previous CNN-based methods that operate on image patches, our model is applied on a full blown 2D image, without any alignment or registration steps at testing time. We further improve segmentation results by interpreting the CNN output as potentials of a Markov Random Field (MRF), whose topology corresponds to a volumetric grid. Alpha-expansion is used to perform approximate inference imposing spatial volumetric homogeneity to the CNN priors. We compare the performance of the proposed pipeline with a similar system using Random Forest-based priors, as well as state-of-art segmentation algorithms, and show promising results on two different brain MRI datasets.

From a training dataset, a non-linear regression model was trained using a deep neural network (DNN) in order to predict the displacement that recovers the optimal location of an anatomical landmark from an input image patch. Using a DNN for each landmark of a 2D simplified model of the spine, a detection sequence was able to localize the vertebral body centers and femoral heads. The whole process is regularized using a statistical shape model of a simplified model of the spine. The quantitative assessment on a set of 121 radiographs of scoliotic patients presented a mean localization errors of 3.5 +/- 3.6 mm and 5.7 +/- 6 mm respectively for the femoral heads and the vertebral body centers (vertebral levels T1 to L5). The mean error for the spinal curve automatic detection was 2 +/- 2.8 mm, which is accurate enough to determine a first estimate of the spine 3D reconstruction in a 3D biplanar reconstruction scheme.

The main features are as follows: 1) to our best knowledge, it is for the first time to use the neural networks and decentralized DSIC scheme to deal with both time delays and asymmetric hysteresis when only the output of each subsystem is available; 2) by combining the Finite Covering Lemma with FLSs, the assumptions of the conservative upper bound functions on the time-delay functions are removed and the Krasovskii functionals are abandoned when deal with time delays. Also, the time delay functions extends to a more general one with states variables and time-delay variables being coupled; 3) by using the initializing technique, the L-infinity norm of the tracking error is obtained; 4) compared with output-feedback backstepping control schemes, the controller design procedures and analysis of stability are greatly simplified by using the proposed decentralized DSIC method in which the low-pass filter at each design step is introduced. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed scheme.

While providing LED photobiomodulation aesthetic treatments of the face, not only the skin condition was improved, but a subjective well-being effect was observed, obvious both in photographs of the treated areas and in patient behaviour. This has been supported by studies showing the beneficial effects of transcranial lasers and LEDs on neurological and psychological conditions, providing great insight. LED therapy can now be used as a standalone procedure to regulate neuronal function. To measure such neurological outcomes in humans, we developed a visual analog scale questionnaire with the purpose of having a convenient tool for the assessment of quality of life following facial LED photobiomodulation. We also gauged patients' emotional state regarding overall aesthetic improvement.

However, more recent work has highlighted that certain environmental exposures early in life may also account for some cases of autism. Environmental insults during pregnancy, such as infection or malnutrition, seem to dramatically impact brain development. Maternal viral or bacterial infections have been characterized as disruptors of brain shaping, even if their underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Poor nutritional diversity, as well as nutrient deficiency, is strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in children. For instance, imbalanced levels of essential fatty acids, and especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are observed in patients with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia). Interestingly, PUFAs, and specifically n-3 PUFAs, are powerful immunomodulators that exert anti-inflammatory properties. These prenatal dietary and immunologic factors not only impact the fetal brain, but also affect the microbiota. Recent work suggests that the microbiota could be the missing link between environmental insults in prenatal life and future neurodevelopmental disorders. As both nutrition and inflammation can massively affect the microbiota, we discuss here how understanding the crosstalk between these three actors could provide a promising framework to better elucidate ASD etiology.

However, cellular and metabolic processes, which orchestrate immune responses, also control inflammation within these sites. Our current understanding of tolerogenic mechanisms has extended the definition of immune privilege to include hair follicles, the colon, and cancer. By catabolizing tryptophan, cells expressing the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase produce kynurenine metabolites, which orchestrate local and systemic responses to control inflammation, thus maintaining immune privilege. This review highlights the double-edged role played by the kynurenine pathway (KP), which establishes and maintains immune-privileged sites while contributing to cancer immune escape. The identification of the underlying molecular drivers of the KP in immune-privileged sites and in cancer is essential for the development of novel therapies to treat autoimmunity and cancer and to improve transplantation outcomes.

Our studies permitted to determine how the tails anchor in the peripheral site of sarin-inhibited human AChE, and which aminoacids are important to their stabilization. Also the energy values obtained in the docking studies corroborated quite well with the experimental results obtained before for these oximes.	[de Almeida, Joyce S. F.

Resistive switching controlled by the hydration level in thin films of the biopigment eumelanin	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							HUMAN SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; X-RAY-MICROANALYSIS; MEMORY DEVICES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; NONVOLATILE MEMORY; SYNTHETIC MELANIN; METAL-IONS; TUNNELING MICROSCOPY; HUMAN NEUROMELANIN	Melanins are biopigments ubiquitous in flora and fauna, exhibiting a range of interesting functional properties such as UV-Vis photoprotection, thermoregulation, hydration-dependent electrical conduction and metal chelation. In the human body, melanins can be found in the skin, hair, middle ear, retina and heart. The metal chelation properties of neuromelanin, a subclass of melanins found in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain, may be involved in Parkinson's disease. Considering synthetic and natural (from the ink sac of the cuttlefish) thin films of eumelanin, the subclass of melanins most investigated by materials scientists, we report on two types of resistive switching (standard and hybrid), with different ON/OFF ratios, observed in planar gold/eumelanin/gold structures. The resistive switching process, based on the formation of conductive filaments, was studied by means of transient electrical measurements, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry. We observed an extended correlation among the factors affecting the two different types of switch: primarily the eumelanin's hydration level as well as the presence of chelating groups in the eumelanin molecular structure and the electrical bias. This work contributes to the development of environmentally benign organic resistive switching devices, namely electrochemical metallization memory cells making use of the biocompatible, biodegradable and abundant eumelanin biopigment as the ion conductive layer.

The purpose of Study 1 was to provide normative data in the adult French-Quebec population (Canada) for semantic verbal fluency (animals), for two sets of phonemic verbal fluency (TNP and PFL), and for letter P alone (60seconds per category/letter). The objectives of Study 2 were to establish the diagnostic and predictive validity of the present tasks and normative data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and major depressive episode (MDE). Method: The normative sample consisted of 932 participants aged 19-91years. Based on multiple linear regressions, equations to calculate Z-scores were provided. To assess validity, performance of 62 healthy participants was compared to 62 participants with AD and 41 with MDE aged over 50. Results: Age and education, but not gender, predicted performance on each verbal fluency task. Healthy adults aged 50 and younger had a better performance on semantic than phonemic verbal fluency. In comparison to MDE, AD participants had lower performance on animals and TNP, but not on letter P. Ninety percent of people with a Z-score-1.50 on semantic verbal fluency had AD and the global accuracy was 76.6%. Test-retest reliability over one year was high for both animals (r=.711) and TNP (r=.790) in healthy older participants, but dropped for animals in people with AD (r=.493). Conclusions: These data will strengthen accurate detection of verbal fluency deficits in French-Quebec adults.

They fulfill important roles in protein folding and the protection of cells from stress. Different forms of Hsp70 have also been found to regulate specific signaling pathways, many related to cell death. Cancer cells are notably abnormally dependent on Hsp70 chaperones for their survival. The importance of Hsp70s as drug targets is increasingly being recognized, particularly as potential cancer therapeutics. This review surveys recent advances in understanding Hsp70 mechanisms and then moves to provide an overview of current efforts directed at inhibiting Hsp70s as a target in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease.

Reading tasks induced left parasagittal spikes with a higher spike frequency when the phonological reading pathway was recruited compared to the lexical one. Here, we seek to localize the epileptogenic focus in the same patient as a function of reading pathway using multimodal neuroimaging. Methods and results: The participant read irregular words and nonwords presented in a block-design paradigm during magnetoencephalography(MEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings, all combined with EEG. Spike analyses from MEG, fNIRS, and fMRI-EEGs data revealed an epileptic focus in the left precentral gyrus, and spike localization did not differ in lexical and phonological reading. Conclusion: This study is the first to investigate ictogenesis in reading epilepsy during both lexical and phonological reading while using three different multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The somatosensory and motor control functions of the left precentral gyrus that are congruently involved in lexical as well as phonological reading can explain the identical spike localization in both reading pathways. The concurrence between our findings in this study and those from ur previous one supports the role of the left precentral gyrus in phonological output computation as well as seizure activity in a case of reading epilepsy.

In this study, we compared functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) results obtained while the participant performed expressive and receptive language tasks with those obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This case study illustrates the potential for NIRS to contribute favorably to the localization of language functions in children with epilepsy and cognitive or behavioral problems and its potential advantages over fMRI in presurgical assessment. Moreover, it suggests that fNIRS is sensitive in localizing an atypical language network or potential brain reorganization related to epilepsy in young patients. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease and Semantic Dementia: An ALE Meta-Analysis of Voxel-Based Morphometry Studies	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; episodic memory; gray matter; meta-analysis; semantic dementia; semantic memory; semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia; voxel-based morphometry	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; PRIMARY-PROGRESSIVE-APHASIA; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; EPISODIC MEMORY; BRAIN ATROPHY; LEWY BODIES; GREY-MATTER; EARLY-ONSET; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES	Background/Objectives: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and semantic dementia (SD) have distinct episodic memory profiles despite the hippocampal atrophy that characterizes both diseases. The aim of this study was to delineate the pattern of gray matter (GM) atrophy associated with AD and SD as well as any differences in these patterns by pooling together the results of previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies. Methods/Overview: We conducted a meta-analysis of VBM studies that investigated GM atrophy in AD patients versus controls (CTRLs) and in SD patients versus CTRLs using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach. Our systematic review allowed us to identify 63 VBM studies. Results: The results confirmed that in addition to the classical cortical pattern of atrophy involving posterior medial and lateral regions in AD and the anterior lateral temporal lobes in SD, both AD and SD patients are characterized by bilateral atrophy of the hippocampus. Furthermore, in SD, the hippocampal atrophy was limited to the anterior portion of the hippocampus, while in AD, both the anterior and posterior parts of the hippocampus exhibited atrophy. When we compared the foci identified in the studies that compared AD patients versus CTRLs with those identified in the studies that compared SD patients versus CTRLs, we observed that the atrophy in the posterior hippocampus and precuneus was more severe in AD. Conclusion: These results support theories that propose that the deficits observed in AD result from damage to the episodic memory network, which involves the posterior hippocampus and posterior medial brain regions. However, sparing of the posterior hippocampus in SD could explain the absence of episodic memory deficits in this population.

Objective: We investigated topographical differences in amyloid burden between SVCI and Alzheimer's disease type cognitive impairment (ADCI) using [C-11] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET). The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in amyloid deposition. Methods: We recruited 44 patients with SVCI and 44 patients with ADCI (amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease) with absent or minimal white matter hyperintensities, all with PiB-positive PET scans [PiB+]. As controls, we included 13 participants with normal cognition and PiB-negative scans. We divided the SVCI and ADCI patients into three groups according to global PiB retention ratio of SVCI, and then compared the tertiles in terms of the distribution of PiB retention using statistical parametric mapping analyses. Lobar to global PiB retention ratio and asymmetry indices were also compared between SVCI and ADCI groups Results: Compared to PiB+ ADCI patients, PiB+ SVCI patients exhibited: 1) increased left-right asymmetry, and increased anterior-posterior difference; and 2) increased PiB retention in the parietal cortex, the occipital cortex and the precuneus-posterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, ADCI patients showed increased PiB retention in the striatum. When stratified by level of PiB retention, each group showed different characteristics. Conclusion: Our results showed that the distribution of amyloid deposition differed between patients with PiB+ SVCI and ADCI. These suggest that CVD contribute to and alter the known progression pattern in amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease.

Recent studies have revealed that pre-fibrillar proteospecies and/or the amyloidogenic process mediate beta-cell degeneration whereas amyloid fibrils are poorly cytotoxic. Thus, therapeutic strategies that aim at preventing beta-cell death associated with amyloid deposition should either sequester prefibrillar species and/or modulate the initial steps of fibrillization. In this view, low generation flexible dendritic scaffolds harboring 4 to 16 hydroxyl, amine, carboxylate or sulfate functional groups were designed and evaluated for their effects on IAPP self-assembly and cytotoxicity. Whereas neutral polyhydroxylated and polycationic dendrimers did not affect the kinetics of amyloid assembly, carboxylated dendrimers accelerated IAPP fibrillization proportionally to surface group density. Interestingly, as revealed by thioflavin T fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, the G0 sulfated dendrimer inhibited amyloid formation by maintaining the peptide in a random coil conformation. In contrast, G1 sulfated dendrimers potentiated IAPP self-assembly into long amyloid fibrils by a scaffold-based mechanism. Anionic dendrimers attenuated IAPP-induced toxicity on pancreatic beta-cells. Our results indicate that sulfated dendrimers can alter the fibrillization pathway of IAPP and inhibit its proteotoxicity, either by accelerating amyloid formation or by trapping the peptide in a non-aggregating and non-toxic state. This study offers novel mechanistic insights for the design of a nanomolecular scaffold to manipulate the self-assembly of natively disordered amyloidogenic peptides.

OBJECTIVE: This article aims to better define the AC's role in this process, by underlining the mental health risks they face, the strategies they use, and the impacts the role has on their own lives. METHODS: This qualitative study is based on the analysis of interviews conducted with the AC following the first year of implementation. The data is part of a larger project aimed at the implementation and evaluation of APIC program. The data were analysed according to the rules of thematic content analysis, which encourages grouping main ideas into categories. This is an iterative process allowing for the constant emergence of new categories during the analysis. RESULTS: Accompaniment is full of joys and positive moments for the AC and participants. However, some difficult situations are encountered and the AC are constantly faced with challenges and constraints. The emerging study themes are as follows: the environment, the characteristics of the person accompanied, the AC's personal limits, and the ambiguities in the accompanier-accompanied relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Five principles drawn from the results will help oversee this practice more efficiently and limit the mental health risks of accompaniers. These findings may permit further development of this type of program for people living with disabilities.

However, few studies have looked at the potential synergetic effects of combining physical and cognitive training in a single study. Prior trials on combined training have led to interesting yet equivocal results. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of combined physical and cognitive interventions on physical fitness and neuropsychological performance in healthy older adults. Methods: Seventy-six participants were randomly assigned to one of four training combinations using a 2x2 factorial design. The physical intervention was a mixed aerobic and resistance training program, and the cognitive intervention was a dual-task (DT) training program. Stretching and toning exercises and computer lessons were used as active control conditions. Physical and cognitive measures were collected pre- and postintervention. Results: All groups showed equivalent improvements in measures of functional mobility. The aerobic-strength condition led to larger effect size in lower body strength, independently of cognitive training. All groups showed improved speed of processing and inhibition abilities, but only participants who took part in the DT training, independently of physical training, showed increased task-switching abilities. The level of functional mobility after intervention was significantly associated with task-switching abilities. Conclusion: Combined training did not yield synergetic effects. However, DT training did lead to transfer effects on executive performance in neuropsychological tests. Both aerobic-resistance training and stretching-toning exercises can improve functional mobility in older adults.

J	Di Palma, A; Sebajang, H; Schwenter, F				Di Palma, Adam; Sebajang, Herawaty; Schwenter, Frank			Metastatic rectal neuroendocrine tumor presenting as an inguinal mass: A case report and review of literature	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS			English	Article						Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor; Metastatic neuroendocrine tumor; Rectal neuroendocrine tumor; NET; Surgical oncology; Chemotherapy	COLON; THERAPIES; NETS	INTRODUCTION: Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a heterogeneous group of rare carcinomas that most often manifest along the gastrointestinal tract. Some of these tumors have the ability to secrete vasoactive peptides and hormones. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The present report describes the case of a previously healthy 52-year old man who presented with a painful right inguinal mass. Upon surgical exploration, a lymph node metastasis of a high-grade NET was found. Further investigations revealed a rectal NET with pulmonary, pelvic and penile metastases. The patient was treated with 6 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide. Although initial follow-up imaging after 3 cycles of chemotherapy revealed stable disease, there was progression of the metastases after completion of systemic treatment. Second and third-line chemotherapy regimens were instituted along with pelvic and whole-brain radiation therapy extending the patient's survival to 18 months after the initial diagnosis. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the aggressive nature high-grade NETs as described in the current literature. Treatment modalities of colorectal NETs include local excision for non-metastatic disease and systemic palliative chemotherapy for advanced disease. However, there are no controlled trials in favor of palliative chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Rectal NETs are rare tumors which often have an atypical presentation or present in advanced stages. Currently, surgical options exist for local disease while treatment modalities for more advanced disease is still under investigation. (C) 2016 The Author( s).

A Phase II Study of Fornix Deep Brain Stimulation in Mild Alzheimer's Disease	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; dementia; deep brain stimulation; fornix	SPATIAL MEMORY; NEUROGENESIS; DYSFUNCTION; METABOLISM; CIRCUITS; TRIAL; ONSET; CORE	Background: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to modulate the activity of dysfunctional brain circuits. The safety and efficacy of DBS in dementia is unknown. Objective: To assess DBS of memory circuits as a treatment for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: We evaluated active "on" versus sham "off" bilateral DBS directed at the fornix-a major fiber bundle in the brain's memory circuit-in a randomized, double-blind trial (ClinicalTrials. gov NCT01608061) in 42 patients with mild AD. We measured cognitive function and cerebral glucose metabolism up to 12 months post-implantation. Results: Surgery and electrical stimulation were safe and well tolerated. There were no significant differences in the primary cognitive outcomes (ADAS-Cog 13, CDR-SB) in the "on" versus "off" stimulation group at 12 months for the whole cohort. Patients receiving stimulation showed increased metabolism at 6 months but this was not significant at 12 months. On post-hoc analysis, there was a significant interaction between age and treatment outcome: in contrast to patients <65 years old (n = 12) whose results trended toward being worse with DBS ON versus OFF, in patients >= 65 (n = 30) DBS-f ON treatment was associated with a trend toward both benefit on clinical outcomes and a greater increase in cerebral glucose metabolism. Conclusion: DBS for AD was safe and associated with increased cerebral glucose metabolism. There were no differences in cognitive outcomes for participants as a whole, but participants aged >= 65 years may have derived benefit while there was possible worsening in patients below age 65 years with stimulation.

It is the second leading cause of parkinsonism, but still underdiagnosis is likely to influence reported incidence figures. Since DIP is clinically undistinguishable from Lewy-body Parkinson's disease, any new case of parkinsonism should prompt the search for an offending antipsychotic, hidden neuroleptic, or nonneuroleptic agent that may produce DIP. DIP is reversible upon drug withdrawal in most cases. There is no consensus regarding the duration of the recovery period to allow motor signs to fully remit in order to confirm the diagnosis of DIP following removal of the causative agent, but a drug-free interval of at least 6 months is generally recommended. Interestingly, up to 30% of DIP cases may show persisting or worsening motor signs beyond 6 months following drug withdrawal or adjustment, due to complex postsynaptic and presynaptic factors that may variably interact to negatively influence nigrostriatal dopamine transmission in a so-called "double-hit" hypothesis. The condition significantly impacts on quality of life and increases the risks of morbidity and mortality. Management is challenging in psychiatric patients and requires a team approach to achieve the best outcome.

The progressive demasking paradigm that we employed integrates word recognition and production by requiring that a participant recognises a progressively demasked stimulus and then say it as quickly as possible. The typing task allowed us to focus on segment by segment aspects of processing during production by enabling us to construct per-letter typing times for each region of a word.Outcomes & Results: We found converging influences across the tasks that correspond to the properties of roots, stems, suffixes and suffix strings.Conclusions: We interpret these effects to accord with a perspective that emphasises the dynamic nature of the lexical processing system and massive interconnectivity within it. This has implications for unimpaired processing and for the word processing challenges experienced by people with aphasia.

Gliomas invade into areas of normal brain, and this cancer invasion is frequently not detected using standard preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). This results in enduring invasive cancer following surgery and leads to recurrence. A hand- held Raman spectroscopy is able to rapidly detect cancer invasion in patients with grade 2- 4 gliomas. However, ambient light sources can produce spectral artifacts which inhibit the ability to distinguish between cancer and normal tissue using the spectral information available. To address this issue, we have demonstrated that artificial neural networks ( ANN) can accurately classify invasive cancer versus normal brain tissue, even when including measurements with significant spectral artifacts from external light sources. The non- parametric and adaptive model used by ANN makes it suitable for detecting complex non- linear spectral characteristics associated with different tissues and the confounding presence of light artifacts. The use of ANN for brain cancer detection with Raman spectroscopy, in the presence of light artifacts, improves the robustness and clinical translation potential for intraoperative use. Integration with the neurosurgical workflow is facilitated by accounting for the effect of light artifacts which may occur, due to operating room lights, neuronavigation systems, windows, or other light sources. The ability to rapidly detect invasive brain cancer under these conditions may reduce residual cancer remaining after surgery, and thereby improve patient survival.

Researchers are now gaining new appreciation for the regulation of ion channel proteins by the membrane lipids in which they are embedded. Thus, as membrane lipids change, for example, during the development of disease, it is likely that the ionic currents that conduct through the ion channels embedded in these membranes will also be altered. This chapter provides an overview of the complex regulation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic voltage-dependent sodium (Na-v) channels by fatty acids, sterols, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and cannabinoids. The impact of lipid regulation on channel gating kinetics, voltage-dependence, trafficking, toxin binding, and structure are explored for Na-v channels that have been examined in heterologous expression systems, native tissue, and reconstituted into artificial membranes. Putative mechanisms for Nav regulation by lipids are also discussed.

Objectives: To determine whether SFNRT programmes reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity, improve acquisition and retention of knowledge and skills, or change teamwork and resuscitation behaviour. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, ongoing trials and conference proceedings in April 2015, and included randomised or quasi-randomised trials that reported at least one of our specified outcomes. Results:SFNRT in low- and middle-income countries decreased early neonatal mortality [risk ratio (RR) 0.85 (95% CI 0.75-0.96)]; the number needed to treat for benefit [227 (95% CI 122-1,667; 3 studies, 66,162 participants, moderate-quality evidence)], and 28-day mortality [RR 0.55 (95% CI 0.33-0.91); 1 study, 3,355 participants, low-quality evidence]. Decreasing trends were noted for late neonatal mortality [RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.20-1.11)] and perinatal mortality [RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.87-1.00)], but there were no differences in fresh stillbirths [RR 1.05 (95% CI 0.93-1.20)]. Teamwork training with simulation increased the frequency of teamwork behaviour [mean difference (MD) 2.41 (95% CI 1.72-3.11)] and decreased resuscitation duration [MD-149.54 (95% CI-214.73 to-84.34); low-quality evidence, 2 studies, 130 participants]. Conclusions: SFNRT in low- and middle-income countries reduces early neonatal mortality, but its effects on birth asphyxia and neurodevelopmental outcomes remain uncertain. Followup studies suggest normal neurodevelopment in resuscitation survivors. (C) 2016 S.

This is due to the polymer solution droplet drying. Besides, the poor stretching capability of the polymer solution limits the production of small diameter fibers. To address these issues, we have examined the two following objectives: first, using an appropriate solvent system for the mass production of fibrousmats with fine tunable fiber diameters; second, nontoxicity of the mats towards Neural Stem Cell (NSC). To this aim, TFA(trifluoroacetic acid) was used as a cosolvent, in a mixture with DCM(dichloromethane), and the solution viscosity, surface tension, electrical conductivity, and the continuity of the electrospinning process were compared with the solutions prepared with common single solvents. The binary solvent facilitated PLA electrospinning, resulting in a long lasting, stable electrospinning condition, due to the low surface tension and high conductivity of the binary-solvent system. The fiber diameter was tailored from nano to micro by varying effective parameters and examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and image-processing software. Laminin-coated electrospun mats supported NSC expansion and spreading, as examined using AlamarBlue assay and fluorescent microscopy, respectively.

Recent advances and open challenges in hybrid brain-computer interfacing: a technological review of non-invasive human research	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES			English	Review						brain-computer interfaces; hybrid; multimodal; EEG; NIRS; body-machine interface; physiological computing	MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS; ERROR-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; MOTOR IMAGERY; BCI SYSTEM; WHEELCHAIR CONTROL; CURSOR CONTROL; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; COMBINING P300; EYE-TRACKING	Context. In recent years, hybrid brain-computer interfaces (hBCIs) have proven to be a promising path towards practical brain-computer interfacing. These hybrid interfaces capitalize on the concurrent recording of various physiological signals, or of the elicitation of more than one mental process, to increase the number of possible input commands and achieve more flexible and robust systems. Although hBCIs have previously been reviewed in some articles, a more recent, and complete survey of the literature is missing to lay the foundations for further research. Objective. This work aims at systematically reviewing recent articles on the topic of non-invasive hBCIs, to comprehensively identify the current trends, limitations and challenges that these studies report. Methods. Three major databases covering the fields of science and engineering were queried. From these and others sources, 55 journal articles from 2008 to November 2014 were selected and analyzed. Results. Twenty-two items were investigated to offer a complete perspective on the current state of non-invasive hBCI research in humans, covering the study rationale, experimental protocol, signal-processing methodology, and system evaluation. Based on this analysis, recommendations were formulated to direct further work in the field. Significance. We hope this review will constitute the groundwork for future hBCI studies.

Using Ptch1(+/-) mice as a medulloblastoma model, sequential mutations were found to shape tumor evolution. Initially, medulloblastoma preneoplastic lesions display loss of heterozygosity of the Ptch1 wild-type allele, an event associated with cell senescence in preneoplasia. Subsequently, p53 mutations lead to senescence evasion and progression from preneoplasia to medulloblastoma. These findings are consistent with a model where high levels of Hedgehog signaling caused by the loss of the tumor suppressor Ptch1 lead to oncogene-induced senescence and drive p53 mutations. Thus, cell senescence is an important characteristic of a subset of SHH medulloblastoma and might explain the acquisition of somatic TP53 mutations in human medulloblastoma. This mode of medulloblastoma formation contrasts with the one characterizing Li-Fraumeni patients with medulloblastoma, where TP53 germ-line mutations cause chromothriptic genomic instability and lead to mutations in Hedgehog signaling genes, which drive medulloblastoma growth. Here we discuss in detail these 2 alternative mechanisms leading to medulloblastoma tumorigenesis.

Gonadal hormones exert potent effects on monoaminergic, cholinergic and peptidergic pathways as well as neurosteroidogenesis which, in turn, impact normal brain organization and function. A spectrum of human neurological conditions are influenced by hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the menopause and use of oral contraceptives. An appreciation of these relationships may facilitate the development of specific hormonal and anti-hormonal therapies for neurological disorders as disparate as catamenial epilepsy and acute intermittent porphyria.

This approach to post-stroke aphasia is based on two pathophysiological concepts: 1) Understanding language processing in terms of distributed networks rather than language centers and 2) understanding the molecular pathophysiology of ischemic brain injury as a dynamic process beyond the direct destruction of network centers and their connections. While considerable progress has been made in the past 10 years to develop such models on a systems as well as a molecular level, the influence of these approaches on understanding and treating clinical aphasia syndromes has been limited. Objective & Methods: In this article, we review current pathophysiological concepts of ischemic brain injury, their relationship to altered information processing in language networks after ischemic stroke and how these mechanisms may be influenced therapeutically to improve treatment of post-stroke aphasia. Conclusion: Understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of post-stroke aphasia on a neurophysiological systems level as well as on the molecular level becomes more and more important for aphasia treatment, as the field moves from standardized therapies towards more targeted individualized treatment strategies comprising behavioural therapies as well as non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS).

Methods: For both experiments, each participant received the three following interventions (20 min tDCS, 1 mA): left-anodal/right-cathodal, left-cathodal/right-anodal, sham. The effects of tDCS were assessed via motor evoked potentials (experiment 1) and metabolite concentrations (experiment 2) immediately after and 12 minutes following the end of stimulation and compared to baseline measurement. Results: No effect of M1-M1 tDCS on corticospinal excitability was found. Similarly, M1-M1 tDCS did not significantly modulate metabolite concentrations. High inter-subject variability was noted. Response rate analysis showed a tendency towards inhibition following left-anodal/right-cathodal tDCS in 50% of participants and increased GABA levels in 45% of participants. Conclusion: In line with recent studies showing important inter-subject variability following M1-supraorbital tDCS, the present data show that M1-M1 stimulation is also associated with large response variability. The absence of significant effects suggests that current measures may lack sensitivity to assess changes in M1 neurophysiology and metabolism associated with M1-M1 tDCS.

The identification of the insular connectivity network is obviously valuable for understanding a number of cognitive processes, but also for understanding epilepsy since insular seizures involve a number of remote brain regions. Ultimately, knowledge of the structure and causal relationships within the epileptic networks associated with insular cortex epilepsy can offer deeper insights into this relatively neglected type of epilepsy enabling the refining of the clinical approach in managing patients affected by it. In the present chapter, we first review the multimodal noninvasive tests performed during the presurgical evaluation of epileptic patients with drug refractory focal epilepsy, with particular emphasis on their value for the detection of insular cortex epilepsy. Second, we review the emerging multimodal investigation techniques in the field of epilepsy, that aim to (1) enhance the detection of insular cortex epilepsy and (2) unveil the architecture and causal relationships within epileptic networks. We summarize the results of these approaches with emphasis on the specific case of insular cortex epilepsy.	[Zerouali, Y.; Ghaziri, J.; Nguyen, D.

Conventional driving assessment (on-road and in-clinic evaluations) has failed demonstrating effectiveness to assess fitness to drive in TBI individuals. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine if driving simulators represent an interesting opportunity in assessing and rehabilitating driving skills in TBI individuals. METHODS: We searched PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane library databases between 27-02-2014 and 08-04-2014 for articles published since 2000 with the contents of simulator driving assessment and rehabilitation. RESULTS: Out of 488, eight articles with the subject of simulator driving assessment and two with the subject of simulator driving rehabilitation in individuals with TBI were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Driving simulators represent a promising avenue for the assessment and rehabilitation of driving skills in TBI individuals as it allows control of stimuli in a safe, challenging and ecologically valid environment and offer the opportunity to measure and record driving performance. Additional studies, however, are needed to document strengths and limitations of this method.

The reliability and construct validity of the ECO were studied among 29 inpatients and outpatients who sustained an acquired brain injury. The instruments were administered by 12 clinicians located at eight rehabilitation centres and the local brain injury association.Results: The ECO provided behaviour profile descriptives much like the original scale. It showed excellent reliability and good convergent and divergent validity, as reflected by significant associations with other measures that contained similar behavioural items and by the absence of signification correlations with broader constructs such as physical and cognitive abilities.Conclusion: This study provides evidence that the ECO behaves much like the original OBS, has promising initial findings with respect to reliability and validity and is a valuable research and clinical instrument to assess the severity and typology of challenging behaviour after an acquired brain injury and to monitor the evolution of behaviours after intervention in French and bilingual communities.

The challenges researchers are facing are non-trivial and the breakthroughs are non-negligeable. Measuring the hardness of a mental task is a fundamental problem in design sciences. In this context, the relationship between electroencephalograms (EEG) signals and the design process is an area of research with applications to the understanding of the creative process and next generation CAD/E systems. Such systems are aiming at becoming more collaborative, conceptual, creative and cognitive. We posit that the relationship between EEG signals, cognitive states and the perceived hardness of design problems is non-trivial. Different problems typically have different levels of perceived hardness. To test this, we study the use of microstate analysis to the segmentation of videos of subjects submitted to creative tasks of various difficulty. Problems and subtasks of different perceived hardness can be shown to exhibit different levels of transient microstates, a measure we have defined on the complexity of the microstate segmentation. We show that the human brain seems to be using 1 - 20% of its transient microstate capacity.

Neurobiology of Elderly Suicide	ARCHIVES OF SUICIDE RESEARCH			English	Review						biochemical; brain; cognition; elderly; genetic; suicide	IMPAIRED DECISION-MAKING; LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION; COGNITIVE INHIBITION; PROACTIVE-INTERFERENCE; OLDER SUBJECTS; RISK-FACTORS; GRAY-MATTER; ATTEMPTERS; BEHAVIOR; AGE	Suicide in the elderly is an underestimated and complex issue that has mainly been explored in sociological, clinical and psychological perspectives. Suicide in non-elderly adults has been associated with diverse neurobiological alterations that may shed light on future predictive markers and more efficient preventative interventions. The aim of this paper was to review studies specifically investigating the neurobiology of elderly suicidal behaviour. We performed a systematic English and French Medline and EMBASE search until 2013. Contrary to literature about the non-elderly, we found a paucity of studies investigating the biomarkers of suicidal risk in elderly adults. Main findings were found in the neurocognitive domain. Studies generally supported the existence of cognitive deficits, notably decision-making impairment and reduced cognitive inhibition, in patients with a history of suicidal act compared to patients without such history. However, replications are needed to confirm findings. Due to several limitations including the small number of available studies, frequent lack of replication and small sample size, no firm conclusions can be drawn. The authors encourage further investigations in this field as insight in the neurobiology of these complex behaviors may limit cliches about end of life and aging, as well as improve future prevention of suicide in the elderly.

LEARNING ALGORITHM BASED MODELING AND PROCESS PARAMETERS RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR BINDER JETTING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESS	INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2015, VOL 1A			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	AUG 02-05, 2015	Boston, MA	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div				Binder Jetting (BJ) process is an additive manufacturing process in which powder materials are selectively joined by binder materials. Products can be manufactured layer by layer directly from 3D model data. It is not always easy for manufacturing engineers to choose proper BJ process parameters to meet the end-product quality and fabrication time requirements. This is because the quality properties of the products fabricated by BJ process are significantly affected by the process parameters. And the relationships between process parameters and quality properties are very complicated. In this paper, a process model is developed by Backward Propagation (BP) Neural Network (NN) algorithm based on 16 groups of orthogonal experiment designed by Taguchi Method to express the relationships between 4 key process parameters and 2 key quality properties. Based on the modeling results, an intelligent parameters recommendation system is developed to predict end-product quality properties and printing time, and to recommend process parameters selection based on the process requirements. It can be used as a guideline for selecting the proper printing parameters in BJ to achieve the desired properties and help to reduce the printing time.

The optimization aims to maximize the film cooling performance while minimizing the corresponding aerodynamic penalty. The cooling performance is assessed using the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness, while the aerodynamic penalty is measured with a mass-averaged total pressure loss coefficient. The conical expansion angle, the compound angle, and the length to diameter ratio of the non expanded portion of the hole are selected as geometric design variables. The effect of varying the geometric variables on the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and the aerodynamic penalty is analyzed using the optimization method and three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is coupled with an artificial neural network (ANN) to perform the multiple-objective optimization. RANS simulations are employed to construct the ANN network which produces low-fidelity predictions of the objective functions during the optimization. The Pareto front of optimum solutions is generated. Two optimum designs, denoted as the aerodynamic, and thermal optimums are chosen from the Pareto front and evaluated through RANS simulations. The optimum designs present improved performance in comparison to the reference design, which consists of cylindrical holes.

In the last decades, functional neuroimaging techniques have enabled studying the neural basis underlying anomia and its recovery. The present study aimed to explore maladaptive plasticity in persistent verb anomia, in three male participants with chronic nonfluent aphasia. Brain activation maps associated with semantic verb paraphasia occurring within an oral picture-naming task were identified with an event-related fMRI paradigm. These maps were compared with those obtained in our previous study examining adaptive plasticity (i.e., successful verb naming) in the same participants. The results show that activation patterns related to semantic verb paraphasia and successful verb naming comprise a number of common areas, contributing to both maladaptive and adaptive neuroplasticity mechanisms. This finding suggests that the segregation of brain areas provides only a partial view of the neural basis of verb anomia and successful verb naming. Therefore, it indicates the importance of network approaches which may better capture the complexity of maladaptive and adaptive neuroplasticity mechanisms in anomia recovery.

Verbal memory impairments in schizophrenia associated with cortical thinning	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Cortical thickness; Verbal memory; Frontal lobes; Parahippocampal gyrus	PERSISTENT NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; 1ST EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN VOLUMES; MRI DATA; THICKNESS; METAANALYSIS	Verbal memory (VM) represents one of the most affected cognitive domains in schizophrenia. Multiple studies have shown that schizophrenia is associated with cortical abnormalities, but it remains unclear whether these are related to VM impairments. Considering the vast literature demonstrating the role of the frontal cortex, the parahippocampal cortex, and the hippocampus in VM, we examined the cortical thickness/volume of these regions. We used a categorical approach whereby 27 schizophrenia patients with 'moderate to severe' VM impairments were compared to 23 patients with 'low to mild' VM impairments and 23 healthy controls. A series of between-group vertex-wise GLM on cortical thickness were performed for specific regions of interest defining the parahippocampal gyrus and the frontal cortex. When compared to healthy controls, patients with 'moderate to severe' VM impairments revealed significantly thinner cortex in the left frontal lobe, and the parahippocampal gyri. When compared to patients with 'low tomild' VM impairments, patients with 'moderate to severe' VM impairments showed a trend of thinner cortex in similar regions. Virtually no differences were observed in the frontal area of patients with 'low tomild' VMimpairments relative to controls. No significant group differences were observed in the hippocampus. Our results indicate that patients with greater VM impairments demonstrate significant cortical thinning in regions known to be important in VM performance. Treating VM deficits in schizophrenia could have a positive effect on the brain; thus, subgroups of patients with more severe VM deficits should be a prioritized target in the development of new cognitive treatments.

Typically, these lesions are approached through a subtemporal or a transcortical transtemporal corridor. To avoid temporal lobe transgression or retraction, and venous drainage compromise, we use a supracerebellar transtentorial (SCTT) approach which gives a direct exposure to the posterior temporo-medial region and the posterior incisural space.

Design: The study used a 2 x 2 mixed design. Methods: Attentional bias toward happy and sad faces in healthy (N = 26) and subclinically depressed individuals (N = 22) was assessed via a neuroimaging dot-probe attention task. Participants also completed trait and state psychological measures and provided saliva samples for cortisol analysis. Results: The subclinical group showed attentional bias toward happy faces; past use of problem- focused coping strategies when dealing with a personally relevant stressor as well as state levels of anxiety, together, contributed to this bias. In the control group, the happy attentional bias was positively correlated with activity in the right caudate. In the subclinical group, the bias was negatively associated with the left fusiform gyrus and positively with the left inferior parietal lobule and bilateral putamen. We observed group differences in association between cortisol levels during the task and neural activity during happy attentional bias processing within the key regions involved in attention. Conclusions: The attentional bias toward happy faces may reflect an active coping attempt by the subclinical participants.

The nonparametric regression estimates include kernel, partitioning, nearest neighbor, additive spline, neural network, penalized smoothing splines, local linear kernel, regression trees, and random forests estimates. The main result is a table containing the empirical L-2 risks of all nine nonparametric regression estimates on the evaluation part of the different datasets. The neural networks and random forests are the two estimates performing best. The datasets are publicly available, so that any new regression estimate can be easily compared with all nine estimates considered in this article by just applying it to the publicly available data and by computing its empirical L-2 risks on the evaluation part of the datasets.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may cause difficulties in text comprehension. However, the heterogeneity of these individuals' cognitive profiles also suggests heterogeneous reading comprehension profiles. The purpose of this study was, first, to identify the text comprehension impairments associated to the cognitive load of texts in participants with MCI, and second, to study the links between reading comprehension and cognitive profiles. Methods: Twenty participants with MCI were included in the study. The cognitive profile was assessed using various neuropsychological tests. Text comprehension was evaluated with the reading comprehension test, "T.C.T.", that included three texts with varied semantic load, and three questionnaires. A descriptive and qualitative analysis of the results was done, as well as a correlation analysis between the results of the neurosphychological tests and the T.C.T. test. Results: Text comprehension impairments (details and main ideas) were found to be dependant upon the semantic load in 12 participants. Significant correlations were observed between episodic memory and the recall of the main ideas and details in two of the three texts. Conclusion: The results of this study make it possible to understand the variability of text comprehension profiles in individuals with MCI. This may allow better-targeted speech-language interventions.

We investigated the clinical utility of amyloid PET in the differential diagnosis of atypical dementia cases and its impact on caregivers. Using the amyloid tracer 18F-NAV4694, we prospectively scanned 28 patients (mean age 59.3 y, s.d. 5.8; mean MMSE 21.4, s.d. 6.0) with an atypical dementia syndrome. Following a comprehensive diagnostic workup (i.e., history taking, neurological examination, blood tests, neuropsychological evaluation, MRI, and FDG-PET), no certain diagnosis could be arrived at. Amyloid PET was then conducted and classified as positive or negative. Attending physicians were asked to evaluate whether this result led to a change in diagnosis or altered management. They also reported their degree of confidence in the diagnosis. Caregivers were met after disclosure of amyloid PET results and completed a questionnaire/interview to assess the impact of the scan. Our cohort was evenly divided between positive (14/28) and negative (14/28) 18F-NAV4694 cases. Amyloid PET resulted in a diagnostic change in 9/28 cases (32.1%: 17.8% changed from AD to non-AD, 14.3% from non-AD to AD). There was a 44% increase in diagnostic confidence. Altered management occurred in 71.4% (20/28) of cases. Knowledge of amyloid status improved caregivers' outcomes in all domains (anxiety, depression, disease perception, future anticipation, and quality of life). This study suggests a useful additive role for amyloid PET in atypical cases with an unclear diagnosis beyond the extensive workup of a tertiary memory clinic. Amyloid PET increased diagnostic confidence and led to clinically significant alterations in management. The information gained from that test was well received by caregivers and encouraged spending quality time with their loved ones.

However, differentiating functional decline associated with healthy aging from the subtle decline experienced by individuals with mild cognitive impairment and early dementia constitutes a challenge. Finding an appropriate tool that can capture these subtle but important functional changes represents a priority. Objectives: The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of using the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Profile (IADL Profile) with elderly participants and to describe their level of difficulty encountered in each task. Methods: The tool was administered to a group of 40 elderly participants living in the community. Results: The IADL Profile was found to be feasible to use in older individuals; the tool also showed sensitivity to the difficulties experienced by this population in everyday functioning. Conclusion: The IADL Profile is a promising ecological tool to evaluate independence in aging and may help to identify individuals with MCI. This tool may also contribute to the development of tailored interventions to enhance everyday functioning in the older population.

An understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of central vasopressin release and perception of thirst is the key to diagnosis and management of these disorders. Mammals are osmoregulators; they have evolved mechanisms that maintain extracellular fluid osmolality near a stable value, and, in animal studies, osmoregulatory neurons express a truncated delta-N variant of the transient receptor potential vannilloid (TRPV1) channel involved in hypertonicity and thermal perception while systemic hypotonicity might be perceived by TRPV4 channels. Recent cellular and optogenetic animal experiments demonstrate that, in addition to the multifactorial process of excretion, circumventricular organ sensors reacting to osmotic pressure and angiotensin II, subserve genesis of thirst, volume regulation and behavioral effects of thirst avoidance.

Much of the controversy is over the extent to which brain structures have evolved independently of each other (mosaic evolution) or in a coordinated way (concerted evolution). If larger brains have evolved by the increase of different brain regions in different species, it follows that comparisons of the whole brain might be biologically meaningless. Such an argument has been used to criticize comparative attempts to explain the existing variation in wholebrain size among species. Here, we show that pallium areas associated with domain-general cognition represent a large fraction of the entire brain, are disproportionally larger in large-brained birds and accurately predict variation in the whole brain when allometric effects are appropriately accounted for. While this does not question the importance of mosaic evolution, it suggests that examining specialized, small areas of the brain is not very helpful for understanding why some birds have evolved such large brains. Instead, the size of the whole brain reflects consistent variation in associative pallium areas and hence is functionally meaningful for comparative analyses. (C) 2016 S.

Incidence decreased and the outcome improved with cART. The immune reconstitution with cART is beneficial for HIV-infected patients and is an effective treatment for PML. However, when it is excessive an inflammatory response immune syndrome might occur with deterioration of PML. So far, no specific therapy has proven efficacious in small clinical trials in spite of some optimistic case reports. Combination of drugs targeted at different stages of JC virus life cycle seems to have a better effect. Passive and active immune therapies, immune competence "boosters" appear promising. New future approaches such as gene editing are not far away.

Current theories propose that the processing of negative emotions is defective in violent individuals and that dysfunctions within the neural circuits involved in emotion processing are implicated in violence. Although schizophrenia patients show enhanced sensitivity to negative stimuli, there are only few functional neuroimaging studies that have examined emotion processing among men with schizophrenia and a history of violence. Objective: The present study aimed to identify the brain regions with greater neurofunctional alterations, as detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging during an emotion processing task, of men with schizophrenia who had engaged in violent behavior compared with those who had not. Methods: Sixty men were studied; 20 with schizophrenia and a history of violence, 19 with schizophrenia and no violence, and 21 healthy men were scanned while viewing positive, negative, and neutral images. Results: Negative images elicited hyperactivations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left and right lingual gyrus, and the left precentral gyrus in violent men with schizophrenia, compared to nonviolent men with schizophrenia and healthy men. Neutral images elicited hyperactivations in the right and left middle occipital gyrus, left lingual gyrus, and the left fusiform gyrus in violent men with schizophrenia, compared to the other two groups. Discussion: Violent men with schizophrenia displayed specific increases in ACC in response to negative images. Given the role of the ACC in information integration, these results indicate a specific dysfunction in the processing of negative emotions that may trigger violent behavior in men with schizophrenia.

This work has focused on hippocampal contributions to constructing coherent mental representations of scenarios for these tasks, which has opened up new questions about the underlying hippocampal mechanisms. We propose a new framework to answer these questions, which incorporates task demands that prompt hippocampal contributions to mental construction, the online formation of such mental representations, and how these demands relate to the functional organization of the hippocampus. Synthesizing findings from autobiographical memory research, our framework suggests that the interaction of two task characteristics influences the recruitment of the hippocampus: (1) the degree of task open-endedness (quantified by the presence/absence of a retrieval framework) and (2) the degree to which the integration of perceptual details is required. These characteristics inform the relative weighting of anterior and posterior hippocampal involvement, following an organizational model in which the anterior and posterior hippocampus support constructions on the basis of conceptual and perceptual representations, respectively. The anticipated outcome of our framework is a refined understanding of hippocampal contributions to memory and to the host of related cognitive functions.

Only 3 consanguineous pedigrees with a recessive form have been published. Case Report: A boy with a negative family history presented polyuria and failure to thrive in the first months of life and was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a normal posterior pituitary signal. A molecular genetic analysis of the AVP gene showed that he had inherited a previously reported mutation from his Lebanese father and a novel A>G transition in the splice acceptor site of intron 1 (IVS1-2A>G) from his French-Canadian mother. Replacement therapy resulted in the immediate disappearance of symptoms and in weight gain. Conclusions: The early polyuria in recessive central diabetes insipidus contrasts with the delayed presentation in patients with monoallelic AVP mutations. This diagnosis needs to be considered in infants with very early onset of polyuria-polydipsia and no brain malformation, even if there is no consanguinity and regardless of whether the posterior pituitary is visible or not on imaging. In addition to informing family counseling, making a molecular diagnosis eliminates the need for repeated imaging studies. (C) 2015 S.

Methods: This single-arm, open-label study of axitinib evaluated the efficacy, safety, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with mRCC whose disease progressed after one prior systemic first-line regimen. Primary objective was objective response rate evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Choi criteria. Progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and QoL were secondary end points. Due to the small study size, analyses comprised of descriptive statistics. Results: Fifteen patients were recruited, five from Canada and ten from Australia, over a limited recruitment period. Thirteen patients received sunitinib as prior therapy. All patients had clear-cell carcinoma, eleven had prior nephrectomy. Liver, lung, and lymph nodes were the most frequent sites of metastases; one patient had brain metastasis. Median time on axitinib was 118.0 days (range: 3.5-645.0 days); estimated survival probability at 12 months was 57.8%. Two (13.3%) patients had objective responses per RECIST versus nine (60.0%) per Choi criteria. Six patients had progressive disease based on RECIST versus three per Choi criteria. Nine (60.0%) events of progression or death occurred by the end of study, and three patients continued to receive the study drug. Fatigue (33%) and diarrhea (20%) were the most common grade >= 3 all-causality, treatment-emergent adverse events. The mean change in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions score from baseline to end of treatment was -0.0837. Conclusion: The small number of patients and lack of a comparator arm limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions; however, safety and efficacy profiles of axitinib were consistent with reports from previous studies in patients with mRCC, and patients generally maintained QoL. The sizeable difference observed in objective response rate by RECIST versus Choi criteria merits further research.

Age Is the Only Predictor of Poor Bowel Preparation in the Hospitalized Patient	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY			English	Article							PREPARATION QUALITY; COLONOSCOPY; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; COMPLETION; NEOPLASIA; CANCER; RATES	We examine the impact of key variables on the likelihood of inpatient poor bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Records of inpatients that underwent colonoscopy at our institution between January 2010 and December 2011 were retrospectively extracted. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to assess the effect of clinical variables on the odds of poor preparation. Tested predictors included age; gender; use of narcotics; heavy medication burden; comorbidities; history of previous abdominal surgery; neurological disorder; product used for bowel preparation, whether or not the bowel regimen was given as split or standard dose; and time of endoscopy. Overall, 244 patients were assessed including 83 (34.0%, 95% CI: 28.1-39.9%) with poor bowel preparation. Cecal intubation was achieved in 81.1% of patients (95% CI: 76.2-86.0%). When stratified by quality of bowel preparation, cecal intubation was achieved in only 65.9% (95% CI: 60.0-71.9%) of patients with poor bowel preparation and 89.9% (95% CI: 86.1-93.7%) of patient with good bowel preparation. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only advancing age was an independent predictor of poor bowel preparation (OR = 1.026, CI: 1.006 to 1.045, and p = 0.008). Age is the only independent predictor of poor bowel preparation amongst hospitalized patients.

Methods: The regional cerebral oxygenation saturation (rSO(2)) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy was compared to pre/post-ductal oxygen saturation and mean arterial blood pressure in three term asphyxiated newborns with documented PPHN during their first 4 days of life while they were being treated with hypothermia. Results: The cerebral oxygen saturation remained relatively stable when oxygen saturation was more than 92% and when there was no difference between pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturations. Episodes of desaturations with a difference between pre- and post-ductal saturations, as well as episodes of hypotension, caused a significant decrease in rSO(2) in these newborns. Conclusion: This case series demonstrates that PPHN has a profound impact on brain oxygenation in term asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia during the first days of life after birth. PPHN may represent an additional risk factor for brain injury in these newborns during the first days of life.

The economic burden of brain metastasis among lung cancer patients in the United States	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Lung cancer; Brain metastasis; Healthcare resource use; Direct costs; Indirect costs; Work loss; Productivity loss; Economic burden	INVOLVED EXTRACRANIAL ORGANS; BREAST-CANCER; SURVIVAL; CRIZOTINIB; CARCINOMA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; ERLOTINIB; SYMPTOMS; PATTERNS	Objective:Brain metastases among lung cancer patients can impair cognitive and functional ability, complicate care, and reduce survival. This study focuses on the economic burden of brain metastasis in lung cancerdirect healthcare costs to payers and indirect costs to patients, payers, and employersin the US.Methods:Retrospective study using claims data from over 60 self-insured Fortune 500 companies across all US census regions (January 1999-March 2013). Adult, non-elderly lung cancer patients with brain metastasis were evaluated over two study periods: (1) pre-diagnosis (30 days prior to first observed lung cancer diagnosis to 30 days prior to first-observed brain metastasis diagnosis) and (2) post-diagnosis (30 days prior to first observed brain metastasis diagnosis to end of continuous eligibility or observation).Outcome measures:Healthcare costs to payers and resource utilization, salary loss to patients, disability payouts for payers, and productivity loss to employers.Results:A total of 132 patients were followed for a median of 8.4 and 6.6 months in the pre- and post-diagnosis periods, respectively. At diagnosis of brain metastasis, 21.2% of patients were on leave of absence and 6.1% on long-term disability leave. Substantial differences were observed in the pre- vs post-diagnosis periods. Specifically, patients incurred much greater healthcare utilization in the post-diagnosis period, resulting in $25,579 higher medical costs per-patient-per-6-months (PPP6M). During this period, patients missed significantly more work days, generating an incremental burden of $2853 PPP6M in salary loss for patients, $2557 PPP6M in disability payments for payers, and $4570 PPP6M in productivity loss for employers.Limitations:Type of primary lung cancer and extent of brain metastasis could not be assessed in the data. The analysis was also limited to patients with comprehensive disability coverage.Conclusions:Development of brain metastasis among lung cancer patients is associated with a substantial economic burden to payers, patients, and employers.

As a result, the paralytic and antinociceptive actions of neurotoxins may be indicated in managing these complications; however, few studies have explored ways to improve outcomes after lengthenings. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) in children undergoing lower limb lengthenings and deformity correction. Methods: Participants with a congenital or acquired deformity of the lower extremity requiring surgery to one limb were randomized to receiving either BTX-A as a single dose of 10 units per kilogram body weight, or an equivalent volume of saline solution. Pain, medication, quality of life, and physical function were assessed at different time-points. Adverse events were recorded in all participants. T test and chi(2) tests were used to compare potential differences across both groups. Results: Mean age of the 125 participants was 12.5 years (range, 5 to 21 y), and lengthenings averaged 4.2 cm. Maximum pain scores on day 1 postoperatively were lower in the BTX-A group (P = 0.03) than in the placebo group, and remained significant favoring botox when stratifying by location of lengthening (femur vs. tibia). Clinical benefits for BTX-A were found for 3 quality of life domains at mid-distraction and end-distraction. When stratifying according to location of lengthening, there were significantly fewer pin-site infections in the tibia favoring botox (P = 0.03). The amount of adverse events and bone healing indices were no different in both groups. Conclusions: The clinical differences in quality of life, the lower pain on the first postoperative day, and the lower number of pin-site infections in the tibia favoring BTX-A support its use as an adjunctive treatment to the lengthening process. The detailed analyses of pain patterns help inform families on the pain expectations during lower limb lengthenings. The amount of adverse events were no different in both groups, and bone healing rates were similar, indicating that the use of BTX-A in children undergoing limb lengthening and deformity correction is safe.

Furthermore, it has been reported that up to 80% of Parkinsonian patients will eventually develop dementia. Thus, it is important to improve the diagnosing procedures in order to detect cognitive impairment at early stages of development and to delay as much as possible the developing of dementia. One major challenge is that patients with mild cognitive impairment exhibit measurable cognitive deficits according to recently established criteria, yet those deficits are not severe enough to interfere with daily living, hence being avoided by patients, and might be overseen by clinicians. Recent advances in neuroimaging brain analysis allowed the establishment of several anatomical markers that have the potential to be considered for early detection of cognitive impairment in Parkinsonian patients. This review aims to outline the neuroimaging possibilities in diagnosing cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease and to take into consideration the near-future possibilities of their implementation into clinical practice.

We tested the curative potential of the non brain-penetrant ACEi enalapril (3 mg/kg/day) administered for 3 months either alone or in combination with the brain penetrant ARB losartan (10 mg/kg/day) in aged (similar to 15 months) transgenic mice overexpressing a mutated form of the human amyloid-beta protein precursor (A beta PP, thereafter APP mice). We studied cerebrovascular function, protein levels of oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutases SOD1, SOD2 and the NADPH oxidase subunit p67(phox)), amyloid-beta (A beta) pathology, astrogliosis, cholinergic innervation, AT1R and angiotensin IV receptor (AT4R) levels, together with cognitive performance. Both treatments normalized cerebrovascular reactivity and p67(phox) protein levels, but they did not reduce the cerebrovascular levels of SOD1. Combined treatment normalized cerebrovascular SOD2 levels, significantly attenuated astrogliosis, but did not reduce the increased levels of cerebrovascular AT1R. Yet, combined therapy enhanced thioflavin-S labeled A beta plaque burden, a tendency not significant when A beta(1-42) plaque load was considered. None of the treatments rescued cognitive deficits, cortical AT4R or cholinergic innervation. We conclude that both treatments normalized cerebrovascular function by inhibiting the AngII-induced oxidative stress cascade, and that the positive effects of the combined therapy on astrogliosis were likely due to the ability of losartan to enter brain parenchyma. However, enalapril did not potentiate, and may even dampen, the reported cognitive benefits of losartan, raising caution when selecting the most appropriate antihypertensive therapy in AD patients.

MNE addresses the ill-posed nature of MEG source estimation through regularization (e.g., Tikhonov regularization). Selecting the best regularization parameter is a critical step. Generally, once set, it is common practice to keep the same coefficient throughout a study. However, it is yet to be known whether the optimal lambda for spectral power analysis of MEG source data coincides with the optimal regularization for source-level oscillatory coupling analysis. We addressed this question via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations of MEG data, where we generated 21,600 configurations of pairs of coupled sources with varying sizes, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and coupling strengths. Then, we searched for the Tikhonov regularization coefficients (lambda) that maximize detection performance for (a) power and (b) coherence. For coherence, the optimal lambda was two orders of magnitude smaller than the best lambda for power. Moreover, we found that the spatial extent of the interacting sources and SNR, but not the extent of coupling, were the main parameters affecting the best choice for lambda. Our findings suggest using less regularization when measuring oscillatory coupling compared to power estimation.

In vervet monkeys, CB1R is present in the retinal neurons (photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells) and CB2R is exclusively found in the retinal glia (Muller cells). However, the role of these cannabinoid receptors in normal primate retinal function remains elusive. Using full-field electroretinography in adult vervet monkeys, we recorded changes in neural activity following the blockade of CB1R and CB2R by the intravitreal administration of their antagonists (AM251 and AM630, resp.) in photopic and scotopic conditions. Our results show that AM251 increases the photopic a-wave amplitude at high flash intensities, whereas AM630 increases the amplitude of both the photopic a-and b-waves. In scotopic conditions, both blockers increased the b-wave amplitude but did not change the a-wave amplitude. These findings suggest an important role of CB1R and CB2R in primate retinal function.

This neurotransmitter system is the main source of acetylcholine to the cortex and hippocampus. In the mature and fully differentiated central nervous system, the phenotype of forebrain cholinergic neurons and their nerve terminals in cortex and hippocampus depend on the continuous endogenous supply of nerve growth factor ( NGF). It has been recently demonstrated that NGF is secreted from cortical neurons in an activity-dependent manner as a precursor molecule, proNGF. Individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome exhibit proNGF accumulation in cortex, yet cholinergic neurons become atrophic in both diseases, despite the apparent abundance of the NGF precursor. This review illustrates the recent evidence that NGF metabolism is affected both in Alzheimer's disease and in Down syndrome brains and also discusses a role for amyloid-beta peptides and central nervous system inflammation in unleashing such deficits. It further considers the potential of the NGF metabolic pathway as a new pharmacological target to slow down the neurodegenerative process both in Alzheimer's disease and in individuals with Down syndrome.

Here, we report on the first-time detection of in-situ expression of activated IL-18 in the human brain in sALS patients. We also detected cerebral in-situ expression of key-molecules known to be closely related to the molecular network associated with the activation/secretion of IL-18 cytokine, namely, the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3 or RIP3), NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-inflammasome, and activated caspase-1. These findings suggest and allow to hypothesize that there might be a role for this cytokine network in molecular mechanisms associated with or implicated in the physiopathology of this neurodegenerative disorder.

J	Weiner, OM; Thien, TDV				Weiner, Oren M.; Thien Thanh Dang-Vu			Spindle Oscillations in Sleep Disorders: A Systematic Review	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Review							SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; ALTERNATING PATTERN CAP; EEG POWER SPECTRA; PRIMARY INSOMNIA; BEHAVIOR DISORDER; NREM SLEEP; FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION	Measurement of sleep microarchitecture and neural oscillations is an increasingly popular technique for quantifying EEG sleep activity. Many studies have examined sleep spindle oscillations in sleep-disordered adults; however reviews of this literature are scarce. As such, our overarching aim was to critically review experimental studies examining sleep spindle activity between adults with and without different sleep disorders. Articles were obtained using a systematic methodology with a priori criteria. Thirty-seven studies meeting final inclusion criteria were reviewed, with studies grouped across three categories: insomnia, hypersomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders (including parasomnias). Studies of patients with insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing were more abundant relative to other diagnoses. All studies were cross-sectional. Studies were largely inconsistent regarding spindle activity differences between clinical and nonclinical groups, with some reporting greater or less activity, while many others reported no group differences. Stark inconsistencies in sample characteristics (e.g., age range and diagnostic criteria) and methods of analysis (e.g., spindle bandwidth selection, visual detection versus digital filtering, absolute versus relative spectral power, and NREM2 versus NREM3) suggest a need for greater use of event-based detection methods and increased research standardization. Hypotheses regarding the clinical and empirical implications of these findings, and suggestions for potential future studies, are also discussed.

Methods: We describe the characteristics of the MDS-UPDRS in a population-based sample of individuals without parkinsonism. Multiple linear regression and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to examine potential associations. Results: Among 194 consecutive individuals without parkinsonism, the mean total MDS-UPDRS score was 12.5 (SD 9.8). Sixty-nine percent (134/193) had motor examination (Part III) scores of 2 or more, 16% (30/194) had scores of 10 or more. Female sex, arthritis or spondylosis, diabetes mellitus, and essential tremor were found to be associated with statistically significant increases in MDS-UPDRS Part III scores. For every 10-year increase in age, the Part III score was greater on average by 2.2 (1.5-2.8). Conclusions: Elevated MDS-UPDRS scores are common in the general population. The overall burden of motor signs of parkinsonism is especially high in older age groups, in women, and in those with particular comorbidities. Whether this represents evidence of a subclinical neurodegenerative process or the effect of co-morbid conditions requires further examination. (C) 2016 S.

Compensatory striatal-cerebellar connectivity in mild-moderate Parkinson's disease	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Dopamine; Putamen; Motor cortex; Cerebellum; Basal ganglia	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; BASAL GANGLIA; DOPAMINERGIC MODULATION; MOTOR NETWORKS; BRAIN IMAGES; MOVEMENT; LEVODOPA; FMRI; REORGANIZATION	Dopamine depletion in the putamen is associated with altered motor network functional connectivity in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), but the functional significance of these changes remains unclear, attributed to either pathological or compensatory mechanisms in different studies. Here, we examined the effects of PD on dorsal caudal putamen functional connectivity, off and on dopamine replacement therapy (DRT), using resting state fMRI. Motor performance was assessed with the Purdue pegboard task. Twenty-one patients with mild-moderate Parkinson's disease were studied twice, once after an overnight DRT washout and once after the administration of a standard dose of levodopa (Sinemet), and compared to 20 demographically-matched healthy control participants. PD patients off DRT showed increased putamen functional connectivity with both the cerebellum (lobule V) and primary motor cortex (M1), relative to healthy controls. Greater putamen-cerebellar functional connectivity was significantly correlated with better motor performance, whereas greater putamen-M1 functional connectivity was predictive of poorer motor performance. The administration of levodopa improved motor performance in the PD group, as expected, and reduced putamen-cerebellar connectivity to levels comparable to the healthy control group. The strength of putamen-cerebellar functional connectivity continued to predict motor performance in the PD group while on levodopa. These findings argue that increased putamen-M1 functional connectivity reflects a pathological change, deleterious to motor performance. In contrast, increased putamen-cerebellar connectivity reflects a compensatory mechanism. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, segmentation methods have been limited by factors relating to reproducibility or sensitivity to change. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a fully automated SC segmentation method (PropSeg), and compare this to a semi-automated active surface (AS) method, in healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (MS). MRI data from 120 people were retrospectively analysed; 26 HC, 21 with clinically isolated syndrome, 26 relapsing remitting MS, 26 primary and 21 secondary progressive MS. MRI data from 40 people returning after one year were also analysed. CSA measurements were obtained within the cervical SC. Reproducibility of the measurements was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A comparison between mean CSA changes obtained with the two methods over time was performed using multivariate structural equation regression models. Associations between CSA measures and clinical scores were investigated using linear regression models. Compared to the AS method, the reproducibility of CSA measurements obtained with PropSeg was high, both in patients and in HC, with ICC > 0.98 in all cases. There was no significant difference between PropSeg and AS in terms of detecting change over time. Furthermore, PropSeg provided measures that correlated with physical disability, similar to the AS method. PropSeg is a time-efficient and reliable segmentation method, which requires no manual intervention, and may facilitate large multi-centre neuroprotective trials in progressive MS.

Placebo analgesia: Self-report measures and preliminary evidence of cortical dopamine release associated with placebo response	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Placebo effect; Pain; PET; [F-18]fallypride; Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; CHRONIC PAIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CLINICAL IMPORTANCE; OPIOID ACTIVITY; HEALTH-CARE	Placebo analgesia is measured by self-report, yet current, expected, and recalled efficacy may be differentially related to brain function. Here we used a human thermal pain model to compare self-reports of expected, concurrent, and recalled efficacy of a topical placebo analgesic, and tested associations of the three measures of efficacy with changes in dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in brain using [F-18] fallypride with positron emission tomography (PET). Participants (15 healthy women) were assessed on three test days. The first test day included a laboratory visit, during which the temperature needed to evoke consistent pain was determined, placebo analgesia was induced via verbal and experience-based expectation, and the placebo response was measured. On two subsequent test days, PET scans were performed in Control and Placebo conditions, respectively, in counterbalanced order. During Visit 1, concurrent and recalled placebo efficacy were unrelated; during the Placebo PET visit, expected and recalled efficacy were highly correlated (rho = 0.68, p = 0.005), but concurrent efficacy was unrelated to expected or recalled efficacy. Region of interest analysis revealed dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was lower in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the Placebo condition (p < 0.001, uncorrected), and greater change in this measure was associated with higher levels of recalled analgesic efficacy (rho = 0.58, p = 0.02). These preliminary findings underscore the need to consider how self-reported symptom improvement is assessed in clinical trials of analgesics and suggest that dopaminergic activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex may promote recalled efficacy of placebo.

Ketones and brain development: Implications for correcting deteriorating brain glucose metabolism during aging	OCL-OILSEEDS AND FATS CROPS AND LIPIDS			English	Review						Brain energy metabolism; Alzheimer's disease; medium chain triglycerides; ketones; aging	MEDIUM-CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; CEREBRAL UPTAKE; KETOGENIC DIET; DEVELOPING RAT; FATTY-ACIDS; BODIES; ADULTS	Brain energy metabolism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized mainly by temporo-parietal glucose hypometabolism. This pattern has been widely viewed as a consequence of the disease, i.e. deteriorating neuronal function leading to lower demand for glucose. This review will address deteriorating glucose metabolism as a problem specific to glucose and one that precedes AD. Hence, ketones and medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) could be an alternative source of energy for the aging brain that could compensate for low brain glucose uptake. MCFA in the form of dietary medium chain triglycerides (MCT) have a long history in clinical nutrition and are widely regarded as safe by government regulatory agencies. The importance of ketones in meeting the high energy and anabolic requirements of the infant brain suggest they may be able to contribute in the same way in the aging brain. Clinical studies suggest that ketogenesis from MCT may be able to bypass the increasing risk of insufficient glucose uptake or metabolism in the aging brain sufficiently to have positive effects on cognition.

The localization of the key eCB receptors, particularly CB1R and CB2R, has been recently reported in rodent and primate retinas with striking interspecies differences. Little is known about the distribution of the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of these eCBs. We therefore examined the expression and localization of the main components of the eCB system in the retina of mice, tree shrews, and monkeys. We found that CB1R and FAAH distributions are well-preserved among these species. However, expression of NAPE-PLD is circumscribed to the photoreceptor layer only in monkeys. In contrast, CB2R expression is variable across these species; in mice, CB2R is found in retinal neurons but not in glial cells; in tree shrews, CB2R is expressed in Muller cell processes of the outer retina and in retinal neurons of the inner retina; in monkeys, CB2R is restricted to Muller cells. Finally, the expression patterns of MAGL and DAGL alpha are differently expressed across species. Overall, these results provide evidence that the eCB system is differently expressed in the retina of these mammals and suggest a distinctive role of eCBs in visual processing.

Identifying which patients are most likely to be at risk of chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is a difficult clinical challenge. Objectives. To examine the relationship between pain catastrophizing, defined as the exaggerated negative appraisal of a pain experience, and early MTBI outcome. Methods. This cross-sectional design included 58 patients diagnosed with a MTBI. In addition to medical chart review, postconcussion symptoms were assessed by self-report at 1 month (Time 1) and 8 weeks (Time 2) after MTBI. Pain severity, psychological distress, level of functionality, and pain catastrophizing were measured by self-report at Time 2. Results. The pain catastrophizing subscales of rumination, magnification, and helplessness were significantly correlated with pain severity (r = .31 to .44), number of postconcussion symptoms reported (r = .35 to .45), psychological distress (r = .57 to .67), and level of functionality (r = -.43 to -.29). Pain catastrophizing scores were significantly higher for patients deemed to be at high risk of postconcussion syndrome (6 or more symptoms reported at both Time 1 and Time 2). Conclusions. Higher levels of pain catastrophizing were related to adverse early MTBI outcomes. The early detection of pain catastrophizing may facilitate goal-oriented interventions to prevent or minimize the development of chronic pain and other postconcussion symptoms.

The listener or reader must be able to use these elements to focus and refocus attention on the mental representation being constructed. Research has shown that this type of attention control is specific to language and can be distinguished from attention control for non-relational (semantic or content) elements. Twenty-two monolinguals (18- 30 years) and nineteen bilinguals (18- 30 years) completed two conditions of an alternating-runs task-switching paradigm in their first language. The relational condition involved processing spatial prepositions, and the non-relational condition involved processing concrete nouns and adjectives. Overall, monolinguals had significantly larger shift costs (i. e. greater attention control burden) in the relational condition than the non-relational condition, whereas bilinguals performed similarly in both conditions. This suggests that proficiency in a second language has a positive impact on linguistic attention control in one's native language.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate that voxel-by-voxel intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) is selective to frequency preference of voxels in the human auditory cortex. Thus, FC was significantly higher for voxels with similar frequency tuning than for voxels with dissimilar tuning functions. Frequency-selective FC, measured via the correlation of residual hemodynamic activity, was not explained by generic FC that is dependent on spatial distance over the cortex. This pattern remained even when FC was computed using residual activity taken from resting epochs. Further analysis showed that voxels in the core fields in the right hemisphere have a higher frequency selectivity in within-area FC than their counterpart in the left hemisphere, or than in the noncore-fields in the same hemisphere. Frequency-selective FC is consistent with previous findings of topographically organized FC in the human visual and motor cortices. The high degree of frequency selectivity in the right core area is in line with findings and theoretical proposals regarding the asymmetry of human auditory cortex for spectral processing.

Our goal was to quantify the total patient burden/benefit in developing a new drug. Methods: We measured risk using drug-related adverse events that were grade 3 or higher, benefit by objective response rate, and trial outcomes by whether studies met their primary endpoint with acceptable safety. The differences in risk (death rate) and benefit (overall response rate) between industry and nonindustry trials were analyzed with an inverse-variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis implemented as a weighted regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: We identified 103 primary publications of sunitinib monotherapy, representing 9092 patients and 3991 patient-years of involvement over 10 years and 32 different malignancies. In total, 1052 patients receiving sunitinib monotherapy experienced objective tumor response (15.7% of intent-to-treat population, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 15.3% to 16.0%), 98 died from drug-related toxicities (1.08%, 95% CI = 1.02% to 1.14%), and at least 1245 experienced grade 3-4 drug-related toxicities (13.7%, 95% CI = 13.3% to 14.1%). Risk/benefit worsened as the development program matured, with several instances of replicated negative studies and almost no positive trials after the first responding malignancies were discovered. Conclusions: Even for a successful drug, the risk/benefit balance of trials was similar to phase I cancer trials in general. Sunitinib monotherapy development showed worsening risk/benefit, and the testing of new indications responded slowly to evidence that sunitinib monotherapy would not extend to new malignancies. Research decision-making should draw on evidence from whole research programs rather than a narrow band of studies in the same indication.

The aim of this study was to assess whether hypoperfusion in parietotemporal and frontal cortices of patients with mild cognitive impairment who converted to AD (MCI-c) and patients with mild AD is associated with atrophy in the MTL and/or microstructural changes in the white matter (WM) tracts connecting these areas. We assessed these relationships by investigating correlations between CBF in hypoperfused areas, mean cortical thickness in atrophied regions of the MTL, and fractional anisotropy (FA) in WM tracts. In the MCI-c group, a strong correlation was observed between CBF of the superior parietal gyri and FA in the parahippocampal tracts (left: r = 0.90, p < 0.0001; right: r = 0.597, p = 0.024), and between FA in the right parahippocampal tract and the right precuneus (r = 0.551, p = 0.041). No significant correlations between CBF in hypoperfused regions and FA in the WM tract were observed in the AD group. These results suggest an association between perfusion deficits and altered WM tracts in prodromal AD, while microvasculature impairments may have a greater influence in more advanced stages. We did not find correlations between cortical thinning in the medial temporal lobes and decreased FA in the WM tracts of the limbic system in either group.

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of five consecutive, daily 20-minute sessions of M1 a-tDCS on motor learning in healthy, cognitively intact, aging adults. Design. A total of 23 participants (51 to 69 years old) performed five consecutive, daily 20-minute sessions of a serial reaction time task (SRT task) concomitant with either anodal (n = 12) or sham (n = 11) M1 a-tDCS. Results. We found a significant group x training sessions interaction, indicating that whereas aging adults in the sham group exhibited little-to-no sequence-specific learning improvements beyond the first day of training, reproducible improvements in the ability to learn new motor sequences over 5 consecutive sessions were the net result in age-equivalent participants from the M1 a-tDCS group. A significant main effect of group on sequence-specific learning revealed greater motor learning for the M1 a-tDCS group when the five learning sessions were averaged. Conclusion. These findings raise into prominence the utility of multisession anodal TDCS protocols in combination with motor training to help prevent/alleviate age-associated motor function decline.

Although TBI is amongst the most common causes of olfactory dysfunction the relationship between injury severity and olfactory problems has not yet been investigated with validated and standardized methods in the first days following the TBI. Methods: We measured olfactory function in 63 patients admitted with TBI within the first 12 days following the trauma by means of the Sniffin' Sticks identification test (quantitative assessment) and a parosmia questionnaire (qualitative assessment). TBI severity was determined by means of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and by duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) as measured by the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test. Results: Poor olfactory scores correlated with a longer amnesia period, but not with GCS scores. Further, we observed higher parosmia scores in assault victims than in victims of falls or motor vehicle collisions. Conclusions: We show that PTA is intimately related to olfactory problems following a TBI. Thus, a thorough evaluation of olfaction is essential in order to detect posttraumatic olfactory dysfunction and to take appropriate actions early on to help the individual deal with this impairment.

Although there are a few literature reviews, mainly of animal studies, on the importance of neurotrophins in the ovary, we aimed to provide a complete review of neurotrophins as well as neuronal growth factors and their important roles in normal and pathological processes in the ovary. Follicular assembly is probably stimulated by complementary effects of NGF, NT4/5 and BDNF and their receptors. The neurotrophins, GDNF and VIP and their receptors have all been identified in preantral and antral follicles of mammalian species, including humans. Transgenic mice with mutations in the genes encoding for Ngf, Nt4/5 and Bdnf and their tropomyosin-related kinase beta receptor showed a reduction in preantral follicles and an abnormal ovarian morphology, whereas NGF, NT3, GDNF and VIP increased the in vitro activation of primordial follicles in rats and goats. Additionally, NGF, NT3 and GDNF promoted follicular cell proliferation; NGF, BDNF and VIP were shown to be involved in ovulation; VIP inhibited follicular apoptosis; NT4/5, BDNF and GDNF promoted oocyte maturation and NGF, NT3 and VIP stimulated steroidogenesis. NGF may also exert a stimulatory effect in ovarian cancer and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Low levels of NGF and BDNF in follicular fluid may be associated with diminished ovarian reserve and high levels with endometriosis. More knowledge of the roles of neuronal growth factors in the ovary has important implications for the development of new therapeutic drugs (such as anti-NGF agents) for ovarian cancer and PCOS as well as various infertility problems, warranting further research.

It remains unclear how these changes modify network connections between brain regions. Here we used diffusion-weighted MRI to relate differences in microstructure and structural connectedness of WM in individuals with congenital or late-onset blindness relative to normally sighted controls. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provided voxel-specific microstructural features of the tissue, while anatomical connectivity mapping (ACM) assessed the connectedness of each voxel with the rest of the brain. ACM yielded reduced anatomical connectivity in the corpus callosum in individuals with congenital but not late-onset blindness. ACM did not identify any brain region where blindness resulted in increased anatomical connectivity. DTI revealed widespread microstructural differences as indexed by a reduced regional fractional anisotropy (FA). Blind individuals showed lower FA in the primary visual and the ventral visual processing stream relative to sighted controls regardless of the blindness onset. The results show that visual deprivation shapes WM microstructure and anatomical connectivity, but these changes appear to be spatially dissociated as changes emerge in different WM tracts. They also indicate that regional differences in anatomical connectivity depend on the onset of blindness.

METHOD: The temperamental status of 121 infants (60 boys and 61 girls) exposed in utero to varying degrees of maternal stress and/or illness during either first (n = 40), second (n = 43), or third (n = 38) trimester of pregnancy was assessed using the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. RESULTS: Higher levels of maternal subjective distress and illness were primarily independently associated with poorer temperamental status in the infants. Maternal subjective distress explained 3.4, 3.1, and 9.8% and early pregnancy illness explained 4.3, 5.8, and 2.9% of the variance of the infants'fussy/difficult, dullness, and needs attention temperament dimensions, respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to assess whether temperament status is influenced by disaster-related prenatal maternal stress. Moreover, this is the first study to assess whether maternal stress and illness during pregnancy interact to determine infant temperament status. The findings suggest that while both factors predict temperament status at 6 mo, they do so primarily in an independent manner. These results suggest that pathways through which maternal stress and illness during pregnancy influence temperament status differ.

We conducted the first known longitudinal study of suicidal ideation in the homeless. Methods We used data collected over 24 months in the Vancouver At Home project (N = 497), comprised two randomized-controlled trials of housing interventions for homeless individuals with mental disorders. Presence of suicidal ideation was determined using the Colorado symptom index. Results Suicidal ideation significantly decreased over time [odds ratio (OR) = 0.31 at 24 months, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.46]. Baseline diagnoses of mood (OR = 2.18, 95 % CI 1.48-3.21) and anxiety disorders (OR = 2.05, 95 % CI 1.42-2.97), as well as depressive mood (OR = 2.52, 95 % CI 1.90-3.33), use of any substance (OR = 1.59, 95 % CI 1.09-2.32), and polysubstance use (OR = 1.90, 95 % CI 1.40-2.60) were significantly associated with suicidal ideation in the multivariate model. Baseline diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (protective effect), daily substance use, intravenous drug use, recent arrest, multiple physical illnesses and history of traumatic brain injury were significantly associated with suicidal ideation in the unadjusted model only. Conclusions Interventions targeting depressive symptoms and substance use could help decrease suicide risk in homeless individuals. Mental health services need to be tailored to address the complex needs of socially marginalized individuals.

Prevalence decreases from 20% to 14% in childhood to 8% to 3% in adulthood. Although the causes and mechanisms of idiopathic primary SB are unknown, putative candidates include psychologic risk factors (eg, anxiety, stress due to life events, hypervigilance) and sleep physiologic reactivity (eg, sleep arousals with autonomic activity, breathing events). Although certain neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, noradrenalin, histamine) have been proposed to play an indirect role in SB, their exact contribution to rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) (the electromyography marker of SB) genesis remains undetermined. No specific gene is associated with SB; familial environmental influence plays a significant role. To date, no single explanation can account for the SB mechanism. Secondary SB with sleep comorbidities that should be clinically assessed are insomnia, periodic limb movements during sleep, sleep-disordered breathing (eg, apnea-hypopnea), gastroesophageal reflux disease, and neurologic disorders (eg, sleep epilepsy, rapid eye movement behavior disorder). SB is currently quantified by scoring RMMA recordings in parallel with brain, respiratory, and heart activity recordings in a sleep laboratory or home setting. RMMA confirmation with audio-video recordings is recommended for better diagnostic accuracy in the presence of neurologic conditions. Management strategies (diagnostic tests, treatment) should be tailored to the patient's phenotype and comorbidities.

Results from two large population-based studies	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Accidental fall; Aged 80 and over; Artificial neural network; Prediction	RECURRENT FALLS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; OLDER-ADULTS; ASSOCIATION; SENSORS; GO	Objective: To compare performance criteria (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy) of linear and non-linear statistical models for fall risk in older community-dwellers. Methods: Participants were recruited in two large population-based studies, "Prevention des Chutes, Reseau 4" (PCR4, n = 1760, cross-sectional design, retrospective collection of falls) and "Prevention des Chutes Personnes Agees" (PCPA, n = 1765, cohort design, prospective collection of falls). Six linear statistical models (i.e., logistic regression, discriminant analysis, Bayes network algorithm, decision tree, random forest, boosted trees), three non-linear statistical models corresponding to artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron, genetic algorithm and neuroevolution of augmenting topologies [NEAT]) and the adaptive neuro fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) were used. Falls >= 1 characterizing fallers and falls >= 2 characterizing recurrent fallers were used as outcomes. Data of studies were analyzed separately and together. Results: NEAT and ANFIS had better performance criteria compared to other models. The highest performance criteria were reported with NEAT when using PCR4 database and falls >= 1, and with both NEAT and ANFIS when pooling data together and using falls >= 2. However, sensitivity and specificity were unbalanced. Sensitivity was higher than specificity when identifying fallers, whereas the converse was found when predicting recurrent fallers. Conclusions: Our results showed that NEAT and ANFIS were non-linear statistical models with the best performance criteria for the prediction of falls but their sensitivity and specificity were unbalanced, underscoring that models should be used respectively for the screening of fallers and the diagnosis of recurrent fallers.

NfvPPA is characterized by effortful speech and/or agrammatism and left frontal atrophy, while bvFTD is characterized by social emotional dysfunction often accompanied by right-lateralized frontal damage. Despite their contrasting clinical presentations, both disorders show prominent left anterior insula atrophy. We investigated differential patterns of insular sub-region atrophy in nfvPPA and bvFTD. Based on knowledge of insular connectivity and physiology, we hypothesized that the left superior precentral region of the dorsal anterior insula (SPGI) would be more atrophic in nvfPPA due to its critical role in motor speech, whereas the ventral anterior region would be more atrophied in bvFTD reflecting its known role in social emotional autonomic functions. Early stage nfvPPA and bvFTD patients matched for disease severity, age, gender and education and healthy controls participated in the study. Detailed clinical history, neurological examination, neuropsychological screening evaluation, and high-resolution T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were collected. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was applied to perform group comparisons across the whole brain and in bilateral insula region of interest (ROI). Correlation analyses between insular sub-region atrophy and relevant clinical features were performed. Whole brain group comparisons between nfvPPA and bvFTD showed the expected predominantly left or right anterior insular atrophy pattern. ROI analysis of bilateral insula showed that the left SPGI was significantly more atrophied in nfvPPA compared to bvFTD, while the bilateral ventral anterior and right dorsal anterior insula sub-regions were more atrophied in bvFTD than nfvPPA. Only left SPGI volume correlated with speech production abilities, while left and right ventral anterior insula volumes correlated with ratings of aberrant eating behavior. These two FTD clinical variants show different patterns of insular sub-region atrophy in the left precentral dorsal anterior and bilateral ventral anterior regions, providing further evidence for the role of these sub-regions in speech production and social emotional function.

The neural correlates of such trait-like differences in episodic and semantic remembering are unknown. We found that self reported individual differences in how one recalls the past were related to predictable intrinsic connectivity patterns of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system. A pattern of MTL connectivity to posterior brain regions supporting visual-perceptual processing (occipital/parietal cortices) was related to the endorsement of episodic memory based remembering (recalling spatiotemporal event information), whereas MTL connectivity to inferior and middle prefrontal cortical regions was related to the endorsement of semantic memory-based remembering (recalling facts). These findings suggest that the tendency to engage in episodic autobiographical remembering is associated with accessing and constructing detailed images of a past event in memory, while the tendency to engage in semantic autobiographical remembering is associated with organizing and integrating higher-order conceptual information. More broadly, these findings suggest that differences in how people naturally use memory are instantiated though distinct patterns of MTL functional connectivity. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Twenty EOAD patients, twenty LOAD patients, twenty matched younger controls, and twenty matched older controls participated in this study. All participants underwent a detailed neuropsychological assessment, an MRI scan, an FDG-PET scan, and AD patients had biomarkers as supporting evidence of both amyloIdopathy and neuronal injury. Results of the neuropsychological assessment showed that both EOAD and LOAD groups were impaired in the domains of memory, executive functions, language, praxis, and visuoconstructional abilities, when compared to their respective control groups. EOAD and LOAD groups, however, showed distinct patterns of memory impairment. Even though both groups were similarly affected on measures of episodic, short term and working memory, in contrast semantic memory was significantly more impaired in LOAD than in EOAD patients. The EOAD group was not more affected than the LOAD group in any memory domain. EOAD patients, however, showed significantly poorer performance in other cognitive domains including executive functions and visuoconstructional abilities. A more detailed analysis of the pattern of semantic memory performance among patient groups revealed that the LOAD was more profoundly impaired, in tasks of both spontaneous recall and semantic recognition. Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) analyses showed that impaired semantic performance in patients was associated with reduced gray matter volume in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) region, while PET-FDG analyses revealed that poorer semantic performance was associated with greater hypometabolism in the left temporoparietal region, both areas reflecting key regions of the semantic network. Results of this study indicate that EOAD and LOAD patients present with distinct patterns of memory impairment, and that a genuine semantic impairment may represent one of the clinical hallmarks of LOAD.

Since coming on the scene in the 1960s, electroencephalography-neurofeedback has become a treatment vehicle for a host of mental disorders; however, its clinical effectiveness remains controversial. Modern imaging technologies of the living human brain (e.g., real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging) and increasingly rigorous research protocols that utilize such methodologies begin to shed light on the underlying mechanisms that may facilitate more effective clinical applications. In this paper we focus on recent technological advances in the field of human brain imaging and discuss how these modem methods may influence the field of neurofeedback. Toward this end, we outline the state of the evidence and sketch out future directions to further explore the potential merits of this contentious therapeutic prospect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Plasma pharmacokinetics, liver metabolism, and blood biochemistry were examined for a limited number of animals to better explain anesthetic drug effects. Selected organs were collected for histopathology. The results for the withdrawal and corneal reflexes suggest a shorter duration and decreased depth of anesthesia with aging. Significant cardiac and respiratory depression, as well as decreased blood oxygen saturation, occurred in all age groups however, cardiac frequency was the most affected parameter with aging, since the 6-, 12-, and 18-month-old animals did not recuperate to normal values during recovery from anesthesia. Pharmacokinetic parameters (T-1/2 and AUC) increased and drug clearance decreased with aging, which strongly suggests that drug exposure is associated with the physiological results. The findings for liver S9 fractions of 18-month-old rats compared with the other age groups suggest that following a normal ketamine anesthetic dose (80 mg/kg), drug metabolism is impaired, leading to a significant increase of drug exposure. In conclusion, age and related factors have a substantial effect on ketamine and xylazine availability, which is reflected by significant changes in pharmacokinetics and liver metabolism of these drugs, and this translates into shorter and less effective anesthesia with increasing age.

We used brain samples derived from a cohort of 33 non-demented controls and 90 Alzheimer's disease autopsied-confirmed cases. HMGCR mRNA levels were determined in the frontal cortex (n = 114) and cerebellum (n = 110) using Taqman-qPCR, and HMGCR protein levels were determined in the frontal cortex (n = 117) using a commercial enzyme immunoassay. While densities of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques were determined in the frontal cortex (n = 74), total tau, phosphorylated Tau, and beta-amyloid 1-42 levels were determined in the frontal cortex (n = 94) and cerebellum (n = 91) using commercial enzyme immunoassays. Despite an increase in full-length HMGCR mRNA ratio in the frontal cortex of women carrying the AA genotype, there were no associations between rs3846662 and HMGCR mRNA or protein levels. An increased Delta 13 HMGCR mRNA ratio was associated with increased levels of HMGCR proteins and neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal cortex but with reduced beta-amyloid 1-42 levels in the cerebellum, suggesting a brain cell type- or a disease progression-dependent association.

Cannabinoid receptors are seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors favoring Gi/o protein. They are known to play an important role in various processes, including metabolic regulation, craving, pain, anxiety, and immune function. In the last decade, there has been a growing interest for endocannabinoids in the retina and their role in visual processing. The purpose of this review is to characterize the expression and physiological functions of the endocannabinoid system in the visual system, from the retina to the primary visual cortex, with a main interest regarding the retina, which is the best-described area in this system so far. It will show that the endocannabinoid system is widely present in the retina, mostly in the through pathway where it can modulate neurotransmitter release and ion channel activity, although some evidence also indicates possible mechanisms via amacrine, horizontal, and Muller cells. The presence of multiple endocannabinoid ligands, synthesizing and catabolizing enzymes, and receptors highlights various pharmacological targets for novel therapeutic application to retinal diseases.

Incidence and Prognosis of Spinal Hemangioblastoma: A Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Study	NEUROEPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						SEER; Spine; Hemangioblastoma; Incidence; Radiation; Surgery; Survival	HIPPEL-LINDAU DISEASE; CORD HEMANGIOBLASTOMAS; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; INTRAMEDULLARY HEMANGIOBLASTOMAS; OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; RESECTION	Objective: Intradural spinal hemangioblastoma are infrequent, vascular, pathologically benign tumors occurring either sporadically or in association with von Hippel-Lindau disease along the neural axis. Described in fewer than 1,000 cases, literature is variable with respect to epidemiological factors associated with spinal hemangioblastoma and their treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of intradural spinal hemangioblastoma with the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database while also presenting an illustrative case. Methods: The SEER database was queried for cases of spinal hemangioblastoma between 2000 and 2010 with the use of SEER*Stat software. Incidence was evaluated as a function of age, sex and race. Survival was evaluated with the Cox proportionate hazards ratio using IBM SPSS software evaluating age, sex, location, treatment modality, pathology and number of primaries (p = 0.05). Descriptive statistics of the same factors were also calculated. The case of a 43-year-old patient with a surgical upper cervical intramedullary hemangioblastoma is also presented. Results: In the data set between 2000 and 2010, there were 133 cases with an age-adjusted incidence of 0.014 (0.012-0.017) per 100,000 to the standard USA population. Hemangioblastoma was the tenth most common intradural spinal tumor type representing 2.1% (133 of 6,156) of all spinal tumors. There was no difference in incidence between men and women with an female: male rate ratio of 1.05 (0.73-1.50) with p = 0.86. The average age of patients was 48.0 (45.2-50.9) years, and a lower incidence was noted in patients < 15 years compared to all other age groups (p < 0.05). There was no difference in incidence amongst the different races. Treatment included surgical resection in 106 (79.7%) cases, radiation with surgery in 7 (5.3%) cases, and radiation alone was used in only 1 (0.8%) case, and no treatment was performed in 17 (12.8%) cases. Mortality was noted in 12 (9%) cases, and median survival of 27.5 months (range 1-66 months) over the 10-year period. Mortality was attributable to the malignancy in 3 (2%) cases. There was no statistically significant different in Cox hazard ratios for mortality for sex, race, treatment modality, pathology or number of primaries. Conclusions: Spinal hemangioblastoma represent a small fraction of primary intradural spinal tumors, and this study did not identify any difference in incidence between genders. Surgical treatment alone was the most common treatment modality. Overall prognosis is good, with 9% observed mortality over the 10-year period, with 2% mortality attributable to the malignancy.

Fetal brain mQTLs were primarily cis-acting, enriched in regulatory chromatin domains and transcription factor binding sites, and showed substantial overlap with genetic variants that were also associated with gene expression in the brain. Using tissue from three distinct regions of the adult brain (prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum), we found that most fetal brain mQTLs were developmentally stable, although a subset was characterized by fetal-specific effects. Fetal brain mQTLs were enriched amongst risk loci identified in a recent large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder with a hypothesized neurodevelopmental component. Finally, we found that mQTLs can be used to refine GWAS loci through the identification of discrete sites of variable fetal brain methylation associated with schizophrenia risk variants.

Study Design Term newborns with perinatal depression referred to our neonatal intensive care unit for possible hypothermia treatment from 2008 to 2012 were enrolled prospectively. The modified Sarnat score on admission was correlated with severity of brain injury on brain imaging and/or autopsy. Results A total of 215 newborns were referred for possible cooling. Sixty percent (128/215) were cooled. Most of the not-cooled newborns with an available brain magnetic resonance imaging (85% = 50/59) had an initial mild encephalopathy, and 40% (20/50) developed brain injury. Some cooled newborns had an initial mild encephalopathy (12% = 13/108); only 31% (4/13) developed brain injury. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that several newborns with an initial mild encephalopathy developed subsequent brain injury, especially when they were not cooled.

Genetic variation of COMT (COMT Val158Met) results in lower enzymatic activity and higher dopamine availability in Met carriers. Given the dramatic changes of synaptic dopamine during adolescence, it has been suggested that effects of COMT Val158Met genotypes might have oppositional effects in adolescents and adults. The present study aims to identify such oppositional COMT Val158Met effects in adolescents and adults in prefrontal brain networks at rest. Resting state functional connectivity data were collected from cross-sectional and multicenter study sites involving 106 healthy young adults (mean age 24 +/- A 2.6 years), gender matched to 106 randomly chosen 14-year-olds. We selected the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) as seed due to its important role as nexus of the executive control and default mode network. We observed a significant age-dependent reversal of COMT Val158Met effects on resting state functional connectivity between amPFC and ventrolateral as well as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus. Val homozygous adults exhibited increased and adolescents decreased connectivity compared to Met homozygotes for all reported regions. Network analyses underscored the importance of the parahippocampal gyrus as mediator of observed effects. Results of this study demonstrate that adolescent and adult resting state networks are dose-dependently and diametrically affected by COMT genotypes following a hypothetical model of dopamine function that follows an inverted U-shaped curve. This study might provide cues for the understanding of disease onset or dopaminergic treatment mechanisms in major neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

This study describes the histopathological aspects of PMG in a large series including a significant proportion of fetal cases. METHOD We have reviewed the neuropathology and medical records of 44 fetuses and 27 children and adults in whom the cortical architecture was focally or diffusely replaced by one or more festooning bands of neurons. RESULTS The pial surface of the brain overlying the polymicrogyric cortex was abnormal in almost 90% of cases irrespective of the aetiology. This accords with animal studies indicating the importance of the leptomeninges in cortical development. The aetiology of PMG was highly heterogeneous and there was no correlation between cortical layering patterns and aetiology. PMG was almost always associated with other brain malformations. INTERPRETATION The inclusion of many fetal cases has allowed us to examine the early developmental stages of PMG. The study indicates the significance of surface signals responsible for human corticogenesis and the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors leading to this common endpoint of cortical maldevelopment.

In this context, considerable research effort is being deployed to find the next generation of cancer immunotherapeutics. The CD73-adenosine axis constitutes one of the most promising pathways in immuno-oncology. We and others have demonstrated the immunosuppressive role of CD73-adenosine in cancer and established proof-of-concept that the targeted blockade of CD73 or adenosine receptors could effectively promote anti-tumor immunity and enhance the activity of first-generation immune checkpoint blockers. With Phase I clinical trials now underway evaluating anti-CD73 or anti-A2A therapies in cancer patients, we here discuss the fundamental, preclinical and clinical findings related to the role of the CD73-adenosinergic pathway in tumor immunity.

The persistent influence of concussion on attention, executive control and neuroelectric function in preadolescent children	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sport-concussion; Children; Brain function; Event related potentials; Cognition	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; HEAD-INJURIES; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION; PEDIATRIC CONCUSSION; ADOLESCENTS; PERFORMANCE; OUTCOMES; TASK	The aim of this investigation was to examine the influence of pediatric sport-related concussion on brain and cognitive function. To do so, we used a between-participants design, measures of executive control, and event related potentials (ERPs). The findings demonstrate that children with a history of concussion exhibit behavioral deficits in attention, working memory and impulse control, as well as neuroelectric alterations in ERP indices of visual attention (N1), conflict resolution (N2) and attentional resource allocation (P3). Furthermore, the age at injury related to the magnitude of several concussion-related deficits. Accordingly, a single sports-related concussive incident during childhood (m = 2.1 years prior to testing) may lead to subtle, yet pervasive alterations in the behavioral and neural indices of attention and executive control, and age at injury may moderate injury outcomes.

In a complex anticipation-coincidence task that required participants to intercept 3 targets with a virtual racquet, the task difficulty was either self-controlled or imposed to the participants in the two phases of the acquisition session. First, the results confirmed the beneficial effects of self-control over fully prescribed conditions. Second, the authors also demonstrated that a partial self-control of task difficulty better promotes learning than does a complete self-controlled procedure. Overall, the results revealed that these benefits are increased when this choice is allowed during early practice. The findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and applied perspectives.

Correlation of fingertip shear force direction with somatosensory cortical activity in monkey	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						grasping; direction; normal force; tangential force; single-unit recording	PRECISION GRIP; CUTANEOUS AFFERENTS; TACTILE PERCEPTION; FLUTTER-VIBRATION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; ARM MOVEMENTS; MOTOR CORTEX; AREA 3B; RESPONSES	To examine the activity of somatosensory cortex (S1) neurons to self-generated shear forces on the index and thumb, two monkeys were trained to grasp a stationary metal tab with a key grip and exert forces without the fingers slipping in one of four orthogonal directions for 1 s. A majority (similar to 85%) of slowly adapting and rapidly adapting (RA) S1 neurons had activity modulated with shear force direction. The cells were recorded mainly in areas 1 and 2 of the S1, although some area 3b neurons also responded to shear direction or magnitude. The preferred shear vectors were distributed in every direction, with tuning arcs varying from 50 degrees to 170 degrees. Some RA neurons sensitive to dynamic shear force direction also responded to static shear force but within a narrower range, suggesting that the direction of the shear force may influence the adaptation rate. Other neurons were modulated with shear forces in diametrically opposite directions. The directional sensitivity of S1 cortical neurons is consistent with recordings from cutaneous afferents showing that shear direction, even without slip, is a powerful stimulus to S1 neurons.

To investigate the cortical mechanisms involved with this behavior, we recorded 230 neurons in the somatosensory cortex (S1), as two monkeys scanned different surfaces with the fingertips in search of a tactile target without visual feedback. During the exploration, the monkeys, like humans, carefully controlled the finger forces. High-friction surfaces offering greater tangential shear force resistance to the skin were associated with decreased normal contact forces. The activity of one group of neurons was modulated with either the normal or tangential force, with little or no influence from the orthogonal force component. A second group responded to kinetic friction or the ratio of tangential to normal forces rather than responding to a specific parameter, such as force magnitude or direction. A third group of S1 neurons appeared to respond to particular vectors of normal and tangential force on the skin. Although 45 neurons correlated with scanning speed, 32 were also modulated by finger forces, suggesting that forces on the finger should be considered as the primary parameter encoding the skin compliance and that finger speed is a secondary parameter that co-varies with finger forces. Neurons (102) were also tested with different textures, and the activity of 62 of these increased or decreased in relation to the surface friction.

Single-trial decoding of intended eye movement goals from lateral prefrontal cortex neural ensembles	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain-computer interface; Macaca fascicularis; neural trajectory; prefrontal cortex	BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACES; WORKING-MEMORY; COMPUTER INTERFACE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CORTICAL-NEURONS; MOTOR CORTEX; DYNAMICS; MACAQUE; INFORMATION; DECISION	Neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) encode sensory and cognitive signals, as well as commands for goal-directed actions. Therefore, the LPFC might be a good signal source for a goal-selection brain-computer interface (BCI) that decodes the intended goal of a motor action previous to its execution. As a first step in the development of a goal-selection BCI, we set out to determine if we could decode simple behavioral intentions to direct gaze to eight different locations in space from single-trial LPFC neural activity. We recorded neuronal spiking activity from microelectrode arrays implanted in area 8A of the LPFC of two adult macaques while they made visually guided saccades to one of eight targets in a center-out task. Neuronal activity encoded target location immediately after target presentation, during a delay epoch, during the execution of the saccade, and every combination thereof. Many (40%) of the neurons that encoded target location during multiple epochs preferred different locations during different epochs. Despite heterogeneous and dynamic responses, the neuronal feature set that best predicted target location was the averaged firing rates from the entire trial and it was best classified using linear discriminant analysis (63.6-96.9% in 12 sessions, mean 80.3%; information transfer rate: 21-59, mean 32.8 bits/min). Our results demonstrate that it is possible to decode intended saccade target location from single-trial LPFC activity and suggest that the LPFC is a suitable signal source for a goal-selection cognitive BCI.

Undertaken between 2009 and 2013, the expansive program of research addressed the epidemiology, impacts, health services, and risk factors of 18 neurological conditions and estimated the health outcomes and costs of these conditions in Canada through 2031. This review summarizes highlights from the component projects of the study as presented in the synthesis report, Mapping Connections: An Understanding of Neurological Conditions in Canada. The key findings included new prevalence and incidence estimates, documentation of the diverse and often debilitating effects of neurological conditions, and identification of the utilization, economic costs, and current limitations of related health services. The study findings will support health charities, governments, and other stakeholders to reduce the impact of neurological conditions in Canada.

Disease-modifying therapies targeting the dysfunctional immune response are most effective in the first few years after disease onset, indicating that there is a limited time window for therapy to influence the disease course. No evidence of disease activity is emerging as a new standard for treatment response and may be associated with improved long-term disability outcomes. An aggressive management strategy, including earlier use of more potent immunomodulatory agents and close monitoring of the clinical and radiologic response to treatment, is recommended to minimize early brain volume loss and slow the progression of physical and cognitive impairments in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

Methods: This is a retrospective study of 128 patients admitted to the Montreal General Hospital following a TBI that occurred while cycling from 2007-2011. Information was collected from the Quebec trauma registry and the coroner's office in cases of death from cycling accidents. The independent variables collected were socio-demographic, helmet status, clinical and neurological patient information. The dependent variables evaluated were length of stay (LOS), extended Glasgow outcome scale (GOS-E), injury severity scale (ISS), discharge destination and death. Results: 25% of cyclists wore a helmet. The helmet group was older, more likely to be university educated, married and retired. Unemployment, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, severe intracranial bleeding and neurosurgical interventions were more common in the no helmet group. There was no significant association between the severity of the TBI, ISS scores, GOS-E or death and helmet wearing. The median age of the subjects who died was higher than those who survived. Conclusion: Cyclists without helmets were younger, less educated, single and unemployed. They had more severe TBIs on imaging, longer LOS in ICU and more neurosurgical interventions. Elderly cyclists admitted to the hospital appear to be at higher risk of dying in the event of a TBI.

Since then, the literature has not provided adequate clues to identify patients who are at higher risk for EDH progression (EDHP) and conversion to surgical therapy. The goal of our study was to identify those patients. Methods: We carried a retrospective review over a 5-year period of all EDH who were initially triaged for conservative management. Demographic data, injury severity and history, neurological status, use of anticoagulants or anti-platelets, radiological parameters, conversion to surgery and its timing, and Glasgow Outcome Scale were analyzed. Bivariate association and further logistic regression were used to point out the significant predictors of EDHP and conversion to surgery. Results: 125 patients (75% of all EDH) were included. The mean age was 39.1 years. The brain injury was mild in 62.4% of our sample and severe in 14.4%. Only 11.2% of the patients required surgery. Statistical comparison showed that younger age (p< 0.0001) and coagulopathy (p=0.009) were the only significant factors for conversion to surgery. There was no difference in outcomes between patients who had EDHP and those who did not. Conclusions: Most traumatic EDH are not surgical at presentation. The rate of conversion to surgery is low. Significant predictors of EDHP are coagulopathy and younger age. These patients need closer observation because of a higher risk of EDHP. Outcome of surgical conversion was similar to successful conservative management.

The purpose of this study is to describe preferences of general practitioners (GPs) with regards to providing care for MS patients. Methods: A stratified sample of 900 GPs in the province of Quebec were sent a questionnaire, with 266 returning completed questionnaires. Respondents were surveyed about their preferences using four clinical scenarios describing hypothetical patients experiencing different stages of MS. Respondents were asked whether they would continue managing the patient themselves, formally refer the patient to a specialist, or seek specialist advice. Results: In two scenarios representing stable courses, 40.9% and 61.6% of GPs, respectively, intended to manage the patient themselves. GPs who reported having experience with MS patients were more likely to report an intention to continue management. In one scenario, GPs operating in rural areas were less likely to consider management than those in the Montreal metropolitan area (odds ratio=0.422, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.90). Conclusions: For MS patients with a stable disease course, an important proportion of GPs appear to be willing to manage long-term care for MS patients.

Two simple language tasks and a different analytical procedure were developed. Methods: Ten healthy participants and 13 epileptic patients completed two language tasks during MEG recording: a verbal memory task and a verbal fluency task. As a first step, principal component analyses (PCA) were performed on source data from the group of healthy participants to identify spatiotemporal factors that were relevant to these paradigms. Averaged source data were used to localize areas activated during each task and a laterality index (LI) was computed on an individual basis for both groups, healthy participants and patients, using sensor data. Results: PCA revealed activation in the left temporal lobe (300 ms) during the verbal memory task, and from the frontal lobe (210 ms) to the temporal lobe (500 ms) during the verbal fluency task in healthy participants. Averaged source data showed activity in the left hemisphere (250-750 ms), in Wernicke's area, for all participants. Left hemisphere dominance was demonstrated better using the verbal memory task than the verbal fluency task (F-1.19 = 4.41, p = 0.049). Cohen's kappa statistic revealed 93% agreement (k = 0.67, p = 0.002) between LIs obtained from MEG sensor data and fMRI, the IAT, electrical cortical stimulation or handedness with the verbal memory task for all participants. At 74%, agreement results for the verbal fluency task did not reach statistical significance. Significance: Analysis procedures yielded interesting findings with both tasks and localized language related activation. However, based on source localization and laterality indices, the verbal memory task yielded better results in the context of the presurgical evaluation of epileptic patients. The verbal fluency task did not add any further information to the verbal memory task as regards language localization and lateralization for most patients and healthy participants that would facilitate decision making prior to surgery.

The use of intraglandular onabotulinum toxin A (OBTXA) injection has been recognized to effectively treat sialorrhea. As OBTXA injection reduces salivary flow rate and alters salivary quality, its use may have a detrimental effect on oral health. AimTo examine the effect of OBTXA injection on caries experience and salivary pH of neurologically impaired children with sialorrhea. DesignTwenty-five children receiving OBTXA treatment and 25 control children were enrolled in the study. Whole saliva was collected to determine salivary pH. All participants underwent an interview on their dietary habits. Dental clinical examinations were carried out to evaluate caries experience and oral hygiene level. ResultsOverall, mean salivary pH value was significantly lower in the OBTXA group (6.920.77) compared with the control group (7.36 +/- 0.70). Caries activity was significantly higher in the OBTXA group (P=0.01). The regression analyses showed a significant association between OBTXA treatment and salivary pH value (P=0.03). Results from the logistic regression show that dental caries was significantly associated with OBTXA treatment (OR=1.73, CI=1.14-27.3). ConclusionsThe study showed an intricate relationship between OBTXA treatment and oral findings. Hence, special dental care should be given to children receiving OBTXA treatment.

J	Gilbert, K; Godbout, R; Rousseau, G				Gilbert, Kim; Godbout, Roger; Rousseau, Guy			Caspase-3 Activity in the Rat Amygdala Measured by Spectrofluorometry After Myocardial Infarction	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 107; Myocardial infarction; Depression; Caspase-3; Limbic system; Amygdala; Apoptosis	LIMBIC SYSTEM; DEPRESSION; APOPTOSIS; MODEL; REPERFUSION; ONSET	Myocardial infarction (MI) has dramatic mid- and long-term consequences at the physiological and behavioral levels, but the mechanisms involved are still unclear. Our laboratory has developed a rat model of post-MI syndrome that displays impaired cardiac functions, neuronal loss in the limbic system, cognitive deficits and behavioral signs of depression. At the neuronal level, caspase-3 activation mediates post-MI apoptosis in different limbic regions, such as the amygdala - peaking at 3 days post-MI. Cognitive and behavioral impairments appear 2-3 weeks post-MI and these correlate statistically with measures of caspase-3 activity. The protocol described here is used to induce MI, collect amygdala tissue and measure caspase-3 activity using spectrofluorometry. To induce MI, the descending coronary artery is occluded for 40 min. The protocol for evaluation of caspase-3 activation starts 3 days after MI: the rats are sacrificed and the amygdala isolated rapidly from the brain. Samples are quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 degrees C until actual analysis. The technique performed to assess caspase-3 activation is based on cleavage of a substrate (DEVD-AMC) by caspase-3, which releases a fluorogenic compound that can be measured by spectrofluorometry. The methodology is quantitative and reproducible but the equipment required is expensive and the procedure for quantifying the samples is time-consuming. This technique can be applied to other tissues, such as the heart and kidneys. DEVD-AMC can be replaced by other substrates to measure the activity of other caspases.

Little is known about how informed are children and guardians when consenting to operation for AIS.Methods.Guardians and their children (10-18 yr) undergoing spinal fusion for AIS were prospectively evaluated at 4 institutions. Each child and guardian was asked to complete a questionnaire of the risks, benefits and expected results of operative treatment and a self-assessment of overall comprehension. A site-survey questionnaire regarding teaching methods, timing between teaching and consent, and healthcare provider involved in the consent process was also used. Significance was assessed using logistic regression examining factors associated with good (6 scores correct) and poor (<6 scores correct) comprehension.Results.One hundred seventy six pairs of patient/guardian were enrolled. Fifty-seven patient/guardian questionnaires were discarded due to incompleteness. A greater percentage of guardians had good overall comprehension of the surgical consent (patients: 59.7%; guardian: 71.4%). Post-operative mobility (patient 31%; guardian 42%) was poorly understood. Surgical risks (i.e., neurologic injury, infection, hardware failure, future sequelae) were modestly understood (40-70% correct). Factors associated with better understanding were older patient age (>12 yr), guardian with a college degree, obtaining consent by the attending surgeon and at a separate preoperative visit than the time of teaching, the use of visual aids, and participation in a peer-support group preoperatively. There was a trend toward guardians' and patients' self-assessment of understanding mirroring their respective objective performances.Discussion.Patients who undergo surgical intervention for AIS and their guardians understand approximately 60% of the surgical consent. The use of preoperative multimodal teaching techniques and peer-support groups may improve patient and guardian comprehension.Level of Evidence: 2	[Theologis, Alexander A.; Anaya, Andres; Sabatini, Coleen; Diab, Mohammad] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Orthopaed Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Sucato, Daniel J.] Texas Scottish Rite Hosp Crippled Children, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Dallas, TX USA; [Parent, Stefan] St Justine Univ Hosp Ctr, Res Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Erickson, Mark] Childrens Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Denver, CO 80218 USA	Theologis, AA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 500 Parnassus Ave,MU 320-W, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.

This raise the question whether maternally produced cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-1 elevated in pathological pregnancies and known to alter fetal development, can cross the placental barrier and affect the fetus directly. Method of study We addressed if IL-1 agonist/antagonist could cross the placenta. Results Radiolabelled-IL-1 injected maternally reached the fetus in minimal amount. 3% of the amount detected within the placenta was transferred into the fetal liver and less than 1% recovered in the fetal brain 30 min after the injection Importantly, transfer of IL-1 was not affected by maternal exposure to LPS. Maternal administration of IL-1 receptor antagonist also reached the fetus in low concentration. Conclusions This suggests that minimal amount of maternally produced IL-1 family members cross the placental barrier. Their negative effects are likely indirect, through their deleterious placental actions.

Effects of fumarates on circulating and CNS myeloid cells in multiple sclerosis	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							FUMARIC-ACID ESTERS; HEME OXYGENASE-1; GLUTATHIONE DEPLETION; DIMETHYL FUMARATE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DISEASE-ACTIVITY; NICOTINIC-ACID; IN-VITRO; BLOOD; MICROGLIA	ObjectiveDimethyl fumarate (DMF), a therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), is implicated as acting on inflammatory and antioxidant responses within both systemic immune and/or central nervous system (CNS) compartments. Orally administered DMF is rapidly metabolized to monomethyl fumarate (MMF). Our aim was to analyze the impact of fumarates on antiinflammatory and antioxidant profiles of human myeloid cells found in the systemic compartment (monocytes) and in the inflamed CNS (blood-derived macrophages and brain-derived microglia). MethodsWe analyzed cytokine and antioxidant expression in monocytes from untreated or DMF-treated RRMS patients and controls, and in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and microglia isolated from adult and fetal human brain tissue. ResultsMonocytes from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving DMF had reduced expression of the proinflammatory micro-RNA miR-155 and of antioxidant genes HMOX1 and OSGIN1 compared to untreated MS patients; similar changes were observed in patients receiving FTY720 and/or natalizumab. In vitro addition of DMF but not MMF to MDMs and microglia inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and increased expression of the antioxidant gene HMOX1 in the absence of significant cytotoxicity. InterpretationOur in vivo-based observations that effects of DMF therapy on systemic myeloid cell gene expression are also observed with FTY720 and natalizumab therapy suggests that the effect may be indirect, reflecting reduced overall disease activity. Our in vitro results demonstrate significant effects of DMF but not MMF on inflammation and antioxidant responses by MDMs and microglia, questioning the mechanisms whereby DMF therapy would modulate myeloid cell properties within the CNS.

Interaction Forces between Supported Lipid Bilayers in the Presence of PEGylated Polymers	BIOMACROMOLECULES			English	Article							PEO TRIBLOCK COPOLYMERS; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; AQUEOUS-ELECTROLYTE SOLUTIONS; EFFLUX TRANSPORTER ACTIVITY; PLURONIC BLOCK-COPOLYMERS; MYELIN BASIC-PROTEIN; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; POLYETHYLENE-GLYCOL; DEPLETION ATTRACTION; HYDRATION DYNAMICS	Using the surface forces apparatus (SFA), interaction forces between supported lipid bilayers were measured in the presence of polyethylene glycol and two other commercially available pegylated triblock polymers, Pluronic F68 and F127. Pluronic F68 has a smaller central hydrophobic block compared to F127 and therefore is more hydrophilic. The study aimed to unravel the effects of polymer architecture and composition on the interactions between the bilayers. Our keys findings show that below the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of the polymers, a soft, weakly anchored, polymer layer is formed on the surface of the bilayers. The anchoring strength of this physisorbed layer was found to increase significantly with the size of the hydrophobic block of the polymer, and was strongest for the more hydrophobic polymer, F127. Above the CAC, a dense polymer layer, exhibiting gel-like properties, was found to rapidly grow on the bilayers even after mechanical disruption. The cohesive interaction maintaining the gel layer structure was found to be stronger for F127, and was also found to promote the formation of highly structured aggregates on the bilayers.

Our aim was to compare the performance of different distributed inverse solutions in localizing IEDs: coherent maximum entropy on the mean (cMEM), hierarchical Bayesian implementations of independent identically distributed sources (IID, minimum norm prior) and spatially coherent sources (COH, spatial smoothness prior). Source maxima (i.e., the vertex with the maximum source amplitude) of IEDs in 14 EEG and 19 MEG studies from 15 patients with focal epilepsy were analyzed. We visually compared their concordance with intracranial EEG (iEEG) based on 17 cortical regions of interest and their spatial dispersion around source maxima. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) maxima from cMEM were most often confirmed by iEEG (cMEM: 14/19, COH: 9/19, IID: 8/19 studies). COH electric source imaging (ESI) maxima co-localized best with iEEG (cMEM: 8/14, COH: 11/14, IID: 10/14 studies). In addition, cMEM was less spatially spread than COH and IID for ESI and MSI (p < 0.001 Bonferroni-corrected post hoc t test). Highest positive predictive values for cortical regions with IEDs in iEEG could be obtained with cMEM for MSI and with COH for ESI. Additional realistic EEG/MEG simulations confirmed our findings. Accurate spatially extended sources, as found in cMEM (ESI and MSI) and COH (ESI) are desirable for source imaging of IEDs because this might influence surgical decision. Our simulations suggest that COH and IID overestimate the spatial extent of the generators compared to cMEM.

Previous research has shown that the cannabinoid receptor CB1R is associated with longer gaze duration and increased brain responses in the striatum to happy faces in adults, yet, for adolescents, it is not clear whether an association between CBR1 and face processing exists. In the present study we investigated genetic effects of the two CB1R polymorphisms, rs1049353 and rs806377, on the processing of emotional faces in healthy adolescents. They participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging during a Faces Task, watching blocks of video clips with angry and neutral facial expressions, and completed a Morphed Faces Task in the laboratory where they looked at different facial expressions that switched from anger to fear or sadness or from happiness to fear or sadness, and labelled them according to these four emotional expressions. A-allele versus GG-carriers in rs1049353 displayed earlier recognition of facial expressions changing from anger to sadness or fear, but not for expressions changing from happiness to sadness or fear, and higher brain responses to angry, but not neutral, faces in the amygdala and insula. For rs806377 no significant effects emerged. This suggests that rs1049353 is involved in the processing of negative facial expressions with relation to anger in adolescence. These findings add to our understanding of social emotion-related mechanisms in this life period.

Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation enhances the effects of motor imagery training in a finger tapping task	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						human; mental practice; motor imagery; motor sequence learning; neuromodulation; primary motor cortex	MENTAL PRACTICE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; PREMOTOR CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION; SEQUENCE; REHABILITATION; ACQUISITION; ACTIVATION; IMPLICIT	Motor imagery (MI) training and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the primary motor cortex can independently improve hand motor function. The main objective of this double-blind, sham-controlled study was to examine whether anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex could enhance the effects of MI training on the learning of a finger tapping sequence. Thirty-six right-handed young human adults were assigned to one of three groups: (i) who performed MI training combined with anodal tDCS applied over the primary motor cortex; (ii) who performed MI training combined with sham tDCS; and (iii) who received tDCS while reading a book. The MI training consisted of mentally rehearsing an eight-item complex finger sequence for 13 min. Before (Pre-test), immediately after (Post-test 1), and at 90 min after (Post-test 2) MI training, the participants physically repeated the sequence as fast and as accurately as possible. An ANOVA showed that the number of sequences correctly performed significantly increased between Pre-test and Post-test 1 and remained stable at Post-test 2 in the three groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the percentage increase in performance between Pre-test and Post-test 1 and Post-test 2 was significantly greater in the group that performed MI training combined with anodal tDCS compared with the other two groups (P < 0.05). As a potential physiological explanation, the synaptic strength within the primary motor cortex could have been reinforced by the association of MI training and tDCS compared with MI training alone and tDCS alone.

To this aim, we recorded cell assemblies from multi-electrodes in the primary visual cortex of anaesthetized cats in response to randomly presented sine-wave drifting gratings whose orientation tilted in 22.5 degrees steps. Cross-correlograms revealed the functional connections at all the tested orientations. We show that a cell-assembly discriminates between orientations by recruiting a 'salient' functional network at every presented orientation, wherein the connections and their strengths (peak-probabilities in the cross-correlogram) change from one orientation to another. Within these assemblies, closely tuned neurons exhibited increased connectivity and connection-strengths compared with differently tuned neurons. Minimal connectivity between untuned neurons suggests the significance of neuronal selectivity in assemblies. This study reflects upon the dynamics of functional connectivity, and brings to the fore the importance of a 'signature' functional network in an assembly that is strictly related to a specific stimulus. It appears that an assembly is the major 'functional unit' of information processing in cortical circuits, rather than the individual neurons.

Genetics of mating in members of the Chaetomiaceae as revealed by experimental and genomic characterization of reproduction in Myceliophthora heterothallica	FUNGAL GENETICS AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Myceliophthora heterothallica; Thermophile; Chaetomiaceae; Heterothallism; Mating; Genomics	NEUROSPORA-CRASSA; THIELAVIA-TERRESTRIS; THERMOPHILIC FUNGI; GENES; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; EUKARYOTE; LOCI	Members of the Chaetomiaceae are among the most studied fungi in industry and among the most reported in investigations of biomass degradation in both natural and laboratory settings. The family is recognized for production of carbohydrate-active enzymes and antibiotics. Thermophilic species are of special interest for their abilities to produce thermally stable enzymes and to be grown under conditions that are unsuitable for potential contaminant microorganisms. Such interests led to the recent acquisition of genome sequences from several members of the family, including thermophilic species, several of which are reported here for the first time. To date, however, thermophilic fungi in industry have served primarily as parts reservoirs and there has been no good genetic model for species in the family Chaetomiaceae or for thermophiles in general. We report here on the reproductive biology of the thermophile Myceliophthora heterothallica, which is heterothallic, unlike most described species in the family. We confirmed heterothallism genetically by following the segregation of mating type idiomorphs and other markers. We have expanded the number of known sexually-compatible individuals from the original isolates from Indiana and Germany to include several isolates from New Mexico. An interesting aspect of development in M. heterothallica is that ascocarp formation is optimal at approximately 30 degrees C, whereas vegetative growth is optimal at 45 degrees C. Genome sequences obtained from several strains, including isolates of each mating type, revealed mating-type regions whose genes are organized similarly to those of other members of the Sordariales, except for the presence of a truncated version of the mat A-1 (MAT1-1-1) gene in mating-type a (MAT1-2) strains. In M. heterothallica and other Chaetomiaceae, mating-type A (MAT1-1) strains have the full-length version of mat A-1 that is typical of mating-type A strains of diverse Ascomycota, whereas a strains have only the truncated version. This truncated mat A-1 has an intact open reading frame and a derived start codon that is not present in mat A-1 from A strains. The predicted protein contains a region that is conserved across diverse mat A-1 genes, but it lacks the major alphal domain, which characterizes proteins in this family and is known to be required for fertility in A strains from other Ascomycota. Finally, we have used genes from M. heterothallica to probe for mating genes in other homothallic and heterothallic members of the Chaetomiaceae. The majority of homothallic species examined have a typical mat A-1,2,3 (MAT1-1-1,2,3) region in addition to an unlinked mat a-1 (MAT1-2-1) gene, reflecting one type of homothallism commonly observed in diverse Ascomycota.

Here we report a means for monitoring in real time the conformational changes undergone by channel proteins upon exposure to pharmacological stimuli. The approach relies on tracking structural rearrangements by monitoring changes in bioluminescence energy transfer (BRET). To provide proof of principle we have worked with Kir3 neuronal channels producing 10 different constructs which were combined into 17 donor-acceptor BRET pairs. Among these combinations, pairs bearing the donor Nano-Luc (NLuc) at the C-terminal end of Kir3.2 subunits and the FlAsH acceptor at the N-terminal end (NT) or the interfacial helix (N70) of Kir3.1 subunits were identified as potential tools. These pairs displayed significant changes in energy transfer upon activation with direct channel ligands or via stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors. Conformational changes associated with channel activation followed similar kinetics as channel currents. Dose response curves generated by different agonists in FlAsH-BRET assays displayed similar rank order of potency as those obtained with conventional BRET readouts of G protein activation and ion flux assays. Conformational biosensors as the ones reported herein should prove a valuable complement to other methodologies currently used in channel drug discovery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although the neurologic symptoms of ZSD tend to be the most prominent, patients also have hepatic, renal and adrenal impairment. Little is known about bone health in patients with ZSD, particularly those with mild or moderate presentation. We investigated 13 ZSD patients who had strikingly abnormal bone mineral density for age. DXA scans showed mean lumbar and femoral neck Z-scores of -3.2. There were no major differences between ambulatory and nonambulatory patients, and no biochemical abnormalities consistent with rickets or vitamin D deficiency were seen. Cyclic bisphosphonate therapy in one ZSD patient was successfully used to increase in bone mineral density. Although the etiology of bone disease in this condition is unknown, we speculate that altered signaling through the PPAR gamma pathway or deficient plasmalogens in patients with ZSD disrupts osteogenesis, resulting in poor bone formation and poor mineralization. Further investigation into the pathogenic mechanisms of bone disease in ZSD and the role of peroxisomal metabolism in osteogenesis may yield insights into the pathology of bone disease and suggest novel treatment options.

Rats learned to perform a two-tone frequency discrimination task over the course of two weeks, combined with either the administration of a cholinesterase inhibitor or saline. We found that while both age groups learned the task more quickly through cholinergic enhancement, the young did so by improving target detection, whereas the old did so by inhibiting erroneous responses to nontarget stimuli. We also found that cholinergic enhancement led to marked functional and structural changes within A1 in both young and old rats. Importantly, we found that several functional changes observed in the old rats, particularly those relating to the processing and inhibition of nontargets, produced cortical processing features that resembled those of young untrained rats more so than those of older adult rats. Overall, these findings demonstrate that combining auditory training with neuromodulation of the cholinergic system can restore many of the auditory cortical functional deficits observed as a result of normal aging and add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating that many age-related perceptual and neuroplastic changes are reversible.

Therefore, identifying markers of neurodegeneration in iRBD could have major implications. We aimed to assess the usefulness of electroencephalography (EEG) spectral analysis performed during wakefulness for predicting the development of a neurodegenerative disease in iRBD. Fifty-four iRBD patients, 28 of whom developed Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy bodies (mean follow-up: 3.5 years), and 30 healthy controls underwent at baseline a resting-state waking EEG recording, neurological exam, and neuropsychological assessment. Absolute and relative spectral powers were analyzed for 5 frequency bands in frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions. The slow-to-fast [(delta + theta)/(beta 1 + beta 2)] power ratio for each of the 5 cortical regions and the dominant occipital frequency were calculated as an index of cortical slowing. Patients who developed disease showed higher absolute delta and theta power in all 5 cortical regions compared to disease-free patients and controls. The slow-to-fast power ratio was higher in all regions in patients who developed disease than in the 2 other groups. Moreover, patients who developed disease had a slower dominant occipital frequency compared to controls. The only significant difference observed between disease-free iRBD patients and controls was higher absolute delta power in frontal and occipital regions in iRBD patients. Specific EEG abnormalities were identified during wakefulness in iRBD patients who later developed a synucleinopathy. EEG slowing is a promising marker of neurodegeneration in iRBD patients.

Replication study of MATR3 in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Matrin-3; Nuclear matrix protein and DNA/RNA binding protein; French-Canadian population; Genetic mutation	DISTAL MYOPATHY; SEQUENCING DATA; MUTATIONS; PROTEIN; VARIANTS; ALS	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an extensive loss of motor neurons in the primary motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Genetic studies report a high heritability of ALS. Recently, whole-exome sequencing analysis of familial ALS (FALS) patients allowed the identification of missense variations within the MATR3 gene. MATR3 was previously associated to distal myopathy 2 and encodes for a nuclear matrix and DNA/RNA binding protein that has been shown to interact with TDP43 in an RNA-dependent manner. Here, we assessed the MATR3 mutation frequency in French-Canadian ALS and control individuals (n(FALS) = 83, sporadic ALS [n(SALS)] = 164, and n(controls) = 162) and showed that MATR3 mutations were found in 0%, 1.8%, and 0% of FALS, SALS, and controls, respectively. Interestingly, among the mutations identified in SALS, the splicing mutation c.48+1G>T was found to result in the insertion of 24 amino acids in MATR3 protein. These findings further support the role of MATR3 in ALS, and more studies are needed to shed more light on MATR3 proteinopathy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Red Blood Cell Transfusion in Patients With Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	TRANSFUSION MEDICINE REVIEWS			English	Review						Red blood cell transfusion; Traumatic brain injury; Systematic review	CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINE; SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; CEREBRAL OXYGENATION; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; ADULT PATIENTS; ANEMIA; MORTALITY; IMPACT	Our objectives were to evaluate the frequency of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as potential determinants and outcomes associated with RBC transfusion in this population. We conducted a systematic review of cohort studies and randomized trials of patients with TBI. We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and BIOSIS databases from their inception up to April 2015. We selected studies of adult patients with acute TBI reporting data on RBC transfusions. Cumulative incidences of transfusion were pooled using random-effect models with a DerSimonian approach. To evaluate the association between RBC transfusion and potential determinants or clinical outcomes, we pooled risk ratios or mean differences with random-effect models and the Mantel-Haenszel method. We identified 24 eligible studies (17414 patients). After pooling data from 23 studies (7524 patients), approximately 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28-44; I-2 = 98%) of patients received RBC transfusion at some point during their hospital stay. Hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion were rarely available (reported in 9 studies) and varied from 6 to 10 g/dL Glasgow Coma Scale scores at admission were lower in patients who were transfused than those who were not (3 cohort studies; 1371 patients; mean difference of 1.38 points [95% CI, 0.86-1.89]; I-2 = 12%). Mortality was not significantly different among transfused and nontransfused patients in univariate and multivariate meta-analyses. Hospital length of stay was longer among patients receiving RBC transfusion compared to those who did not (3 studies; n = 455; mean difference, 9.58 days [95% CI, 3.94-15.22]; I-2 = 74%). Results should be considered cautiously due to the high heterogeneity and high risk of confounding from the observational nature of included studies.

Time-frequency analysis can reveal large high-frequency (HF) power changes (80-500 Hz) associated with inter-ictal spikes. The present study determines how well the rate of HFOs and spike-related HF power changes were co-localized with SOZ. Methods: We analyzed 583 channels (68 in the SOZ) sampled from 14 patients who underwent intracranial EEG recording. We determined if the rate of visually-marked HFOs and spike-related HF power changes differed between SOZ and non-SOZ. Results: Significantly higher rates of HFOs were found in SOZ. The degree of spike-related HF power augmentation failed to differ between SOZ and non-SOZ, whereas that of post-spike HF power attenuation was significantly more severe in SOZ compared to in non-SOZ. Regions showing HFOs and large spike-related HF-changes showed a partial overlap in distribution in 7/14 patients. Conclusions: Strong HF augmentation during spikes and high HFO rates occurred over different brain locations. The rate of HFOs showed the best performance in identifying SOZ. Post-spike HF power attenuation may represent increased inhibition in these channels and should be investigated further. Significance: Strong HF power changes during spikes and HFOs per se seem to reflect distinct phenomena. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Ripples often co-occur with spikes. We investigated the spatiotemporal relation between spikes and ripples, and differences between spikes that do and do not co-occur with ripples. Methods: We marked 50 time points with spikes in bipolar surface EEG during NREM sleep in patients with focal or multifocal epilepsy. We marked ripples that occurred with spikes and calculated parameters relating spikes and ripples: the duration, amplitude and slope of spikes, the timing of the start of ripples and spikes and the proportion of overlap. Results: In total 219 ripples and 5995 individual spikes were marked in 31 patients. Spikes with ripples were on average shorter, had higher amplitude and higher slope than spikes without ripples. 64% of ripples started before spikes started. Spikes occurred on 13 (5-26) channels per patient, and ripples on 3 (0-14) channels, which were also spike channels. Conclusion: Ripples precede rather than follow spikes, so ripples are unlikely to result from spikes. Significance: Ripples and spikes seem not one-on-one coupled, but certain states of the brain can accommodate both. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

To distinguish real HFOs from spurious ones using analysis of the raw signal. Method: We developed a new method to prevent false HFO detections due to the filtering effect by detecting oscillations in the raw signal at the time of sharp events. We specified temporal features to classify sharp events with and without HFOs using support vector machine in both ripple and fast ripple bands. The traditionally used time-frequency representation served as the gold standard to indicate real and false HFOs. Results: 44% of ripples and 43% of FRs concurring with sharp events were found to be false HFOs. Sharp events with HFOs had significantly more oscillations in the raw signal than sharp events without. They could be distinguished from false HFOs with accuracy of 76.6% in the ripple band and 72.6% in the fast ripple band. Conclusion: It may be most appropriate to detect HFOs as oscillations not only on the filtered signal but also on the raw signal. The classical time-frequency display used for identifying HFOs should be used with great care due to the possible masking effect of broadband activities. Significance: The separation of real HFOs from broadband activities will raise the validity of HFO detection methods and will therefore support future HFO investigations.

This increase can be the result of both muscle atrophy and reciprocal facilitation mechanism. It remains however unclear to what extent increased antagonist muscles activation could be rather attributable to central vs. peripheral changes during voluntary contractions achieved by SCI participants. Methods: We investigated the activations of elbow extensors and flexors during isometric elbow flexion and extension contractions performed at 3 force levels by 10 healthy participants and 8 participants with cervical SCI (cSCI). Results: At similar force level and absolute net torque in flexion, the antagonist muscles activation was increased for the participants with cSCI. At similar absolute net torque in extension, the activations of agonist and antagonist muscles were increased for the participants with cSCI. Conclusion: During flexion contractions, increased antagonist muscles activation may be explained by extensors atrophy or reciprocal facilitation. During extension contractions, increased antagonist muscles activation may reflect the importance of reciprocal facilitation as antagonist muscles were evaluated as intact by clinical testing and maximal net joint torque recording. Significance: These results in cSCI participants revealed an increased activation of antagonist muscles, which may reflect a reorganization of the spinal reflexes and their supraspinal control involved during isometric elbow contractions.

Practical application of AOPs in chemical-specific risk assessment requires incorporation of knowledge on exposure, along with absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of chemicals. OBJECTIVES: We developed a conceptual workflow to examine exposure and ADME properties in relation to an MIE. The utility of this workflow was evaluated using a previously established AOP, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. METHODS: Thirty chemicals found to inhibit human AChE in the ToxCast (TM) assay were examined with respect to their exposure, absorption potential, and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Structures of active chemicals were compared against structures of 1,029 inactive chemicals to detect possible parent compounds that might have active metabolites. RESULTS: Application of the workflow screened 10 "low-priority" chemicals of 30 active chemicals. Fifty-two of the 1,029 inactive chemicals exhibited a similarity threshold of >= 75% with their nearest active neighbors. Of these 52 compounds, 30 were excluded due to poor absorption or distribution. The remaining 22 compounds may inhibit AChE in vivo either directly or as a result of metabolic activation. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of exposure and ADME properties into the conceptual workflow eliminated 10 "low-priority" chemicals that may otherwise have undergone additional, resource-consuming analyses. Our workflow also increased confidence in interpretation of in vitro results by identifying possible "false negatives."

Myelin basic protein (MBP) is required for normal myelin elaboration with maximal mbp transcription in oligodendrocytes requiring the upstream M3 enhancer. To further characterize the mechanism regulating mbp transcription, we defined M3 structure/function relationships by evaluating its evolutionary conservation, DNA footprints and the developmental programing conferred in mice by M3 derivatives. Multiple M3 regulatory element combinations were found to drive expression in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells with a minimal 129 bp sequence conferring expression in oligodendrocytes throughout myelin elaboration, maintenance and repair. Unexpectedly, M3 derivatives conferred markedly different spatial and temporal expression programs thus illuminating striking transcriptional heterogeneity within post-mitotic oligodendrocytes. Finally, one M3 derivative engaged only during primary myelination, not during adult remyelination, demonstrating that transcriptional regulation in the two states is not equivalent.

However, few studies have simultaneously examined whether these patterns of attention are shared among disorders or distinguish between them. In the present study, we recorded the Late Positive Potential (LPP), an event-related potential and putative index of motivated attention, from 145 patients with anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders and 32 controls, as they viewed blocks of rewarding and threatening images, respectively. We found that a current diagnosis of depression was associated with a reduced LPP to rewarding visual stimuli. This appeared to be specific to a subgroup of individuals with early onset depression; this subgroup was also characterized by a reduced LPP to threatening images. Anxiety diagnosis and age of onset of anxiety, whether comorbid with depression or not, was unrelated to the magnitude of the LPP. Finally, a transdiagnostic symptom dimension measuring current severity of suicidal ideation was related to a reduced LPP to both rewarding and threatening images. These data suggest that dysfunction in neural markers of attention to threat and reward can effectively distinguish features of depression from anxiety, particularly early onset depression, and may track suicidal ideation across disorders.

Recollection Rejection of New Items in Individuals With First-Episode Psychosis	JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						first-episode psychosis; fMRI; episodic memory; correct rejection; false recognition	EPISODIC MEMORY RETRIEVAL; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; FALSE RECOGNITION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTICHOLINERGIC MEDICATION; FUNCTIONAL MECHANISMS; CONJUNCTION ERRORS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TRUE RECOGNITION	Many objects seen for the first time look familiar because they resemble known objects. To overcome this feeling of familiarity and detect novelty, memories of known objects must be recollected and compared to new objects. This experiment examines whether recollection performed when perceiving new items (i.e., recollection rejection) is abnormal in people who experienced a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Recollection of old items is impaired in this clinical population but it has not yet been demonstrated that this impairment influences the processing of new items. Eighteen FEP participants and 19 healthy controls completed an episodic memory task consisting of a study phase and a recognition phase. All the new objects looked familiar because they resembled the studied objects. Brain activity underlying false recognition and correct rejection of new objects was measured with functional resonance magnetic imaging and compared across groups. Behavioral responses to new items were not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, the between-groups analysis revealed significant differences in brain activity in the left middle frontal gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule, the right superior parietal lobule, and the right temporal fusiform gyrus during the correct rejection of new items. This activity seems related to recollection rejection and suggests that FEP patients do not normally recollect information of past events when they process new items.

The glycerolipid/ fatty acid cycle, encompassing lipolysis and lipogenesis, generates many lipid signals. Reliable procedures are not available for measuring activities of several lipolytic enzymes for the purposes of drug screening, and this resulted in questionable selectivity of various known lipase inhibitors. We now describe simple assays for lipolytic enzymes, including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), sn-1-diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL), monoacylglycerol lipase, alpha/beta-hydrolase domain 6, and carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) using recombinant human and mouse enzymes either in cell extracts or using purified enzymes. We observed that many of the reported inhibitors lack specificity. Thus, Cay10499 (HSL inhibitor) and RHC20867 (DAGL inhibitor) also inhibit other lipases. Marked differences in the inhibitor sensitivities of human ATGL and HSL compared with the corresponding mouse enzymes was noticed. Thus, ATGListatin inhibited mouse ATGL but not human ATGL, and the HSL inhibitors WWL11 and Compound 13f were effective against mouse enzyme but much less potent against human enzyme. Many of these lipase inhibitors also inhibited human CES1. Results describe reliable assays for measuring lipase activities that are amenable for drug screening and also caution about the specificity of the many earlier described lipase inhibitors.

The National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria A Bridge Too Far	JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE			English	Article						Classification of mental disorders; explanation in psychiatry; reductionism; Research Domain Criteria	BRAIN DISORDERS; NIMH RESEARCH; SOCIAL BRAIN; RDOC; PSYCHIATRY; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; NEUROSCIENCE; DEPRESSION; DIAGNOSIS; FRAMEWORK	The National Institute of Mental Health is actively promoting Research Domain Criteria as a new model for the research on mental disorders. Research Domain Criteria approaches disorders through a matrix, linking units of analysis with domains, based on the assumption that psychopathology reflects abnormal connectivity in the brain. This review suggests that the Research Domain Criteria perspective is likely to fail to provide an adequate basis for clinical psychiatric theory and practice. First, it uses models from neuroscience that are insufficiently developed. Second, it is based on the premise that mental phenomena and mental disorders can be reduced to neural activity, without consideration of cognition, experience, and social interaction. Third, it downplays psychosocial factors in psychopathology and treatment. Research Domain Criteria may therefore prove inadequate for providing a neuroscientific basis for psychiatric nosology and treatment and needs to be supplemented with a broader view that incorporates insights from social sciences, psychology, and phenomenology.

The superior performance levels for the trained, compared to the untrained sequence, were associated with a greater magnitude of activity within the primary motor cortex (M1), bilaterally, for the trained sequence. The differential responses in the trained' M1, ipsilateral to the untrained hand, were positively correlated with experience-related differences in the functional connectivity between the trained' M1 and (1) its homologue and (2) the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) within the contralateral hemisphere. No significant correlation was evident between experience-related differences in M1-M1 and M1-PMd connectivity measures. These results suggest that the transfer of sequence-specific information between the two primary motor cortices is predominantly mediated by excitatory mechanisms driven by the trained' M1 via two independent neural pathways. AbstractFollowing unimanual training on a novel sequence of movements, sequence-specific performance may improve overnight not only in the trained hand, but also in the hand afforded no actual physical experience. It is not clear, however, how transfer to the untrained hand is achieved. In the present study, we examined whether and how interaction between the two primary motor cortices contributes to the performance of a sequence of movements, extensively trained the day before, by the untrained hand. Acordingly, we studied participants during the untrained-hand performance of a finger-to-thumb opposition sequence (FOS), intensively trained a day earlier (T-FOS), and a similarly constructed, but novel, untrained FOS (U-FOS). Changes in neural signals driven by task performance were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging. To minimize potential differences as a result of the rate of sequence execution per se, participants performed both sequences at an identical paced rate. The analyses showed that the superior fluency in executing the T-FOS compared to the U-FOS was associated with higher activity within the primary motor cortex (M1), bilaterally, for the T-FOS. The differential responses in the trained' M1 were positively correlated with experience-related differences in the functional connectivity between the trained' M1 and (1) its left homologue and (2) the left dorsal premotor cortex. However, no significant correlation was evident between the changes in connectivity in these two routes. These results suggest that the transfer of sequence-specific information between the two primary motor cortices is predominantly mediated by excitatory mechanisms driven by the trained' M1 via at least two independent neural pathways. Key points Participants were scanned during the untrained-hand performance of a motor sequence, intensively trained a day earlier, and also a similarly constructed but novel, untrained sequence. The superior performance levels for the trained, compared to the untrained sequence, were associated with a greater magnitude of activity within the primary motor cortex (M1), bilaterally, for the trained sequence. The differential responses in the trained' M1, ipsilateral to the untrained hand, were positively correlated with experience-related differences in the functional connectivity between the trained' M1 and (1) its homologue and (2) the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) within the contralateral hemisphere.

Bruce			The Effect of Dissolved Oxygen on the Susceptibility of Blood	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						susceptibility; dissolved O-2; blood; BOLD; hyperoxia	MAGNETIC-FIELD INHOMOGENEITY; FOURIER-BASED METHOD; HUMAN BRAIN; CYLINDER APPROXIMATION; SENSORY STIMULATION; SATURATION; CONTRAST; WATER; MR; QUANTIFICATION	Purpose: It has been predicted that, during hyperoxia, excess O-2 dissolved in arterial blood will significantly alter the blood's magnetic susceptibility. This would confound the interpretation of the hyperoxia-induced blood oxygenation level-dependent signal as arising solely from changes in deoxyhemoglobin. This study, therefore, aimed to determine how dissolved O-2 affects the susceptibility of blood. Theory and Methods: We present a comprehensive model for the effect of dissolved O-2 on the susceptibility of blood and compare it with another recently published model, referred to here as the ideal gas model (IGM). For validation, distilled water and samples of bovine plasma were oxygenated over a range of hyperoxic O-2 concentrations and their susceptibilities were determined using multiecho gradient echo phase imaging. Results: In distilled water and plasma, the measured changes in susceptibility were very linear, with identical slopes of 0.062 ppb/mm Hg of O-2. This change was dramatically less than previously predicted using the IGM and was close to that predicted by our model. The primary source of error in the IGM is the overestimation of the volume fraction occupied by dissolved O-2. Conclusion: Under most physiological conditions, the susceptibility of dissolved O-2 can be disregarded in MRI studies employing hyperoxia. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	[Berman, Avery J.

Yet scant research has investigated the neuronal correlates of insight into symptoms (IS), a dimension of insight that may be particularly significant in enduring schizophrenia. Sixty-six patients with enduring schizophrenia (duration >4 years) and 33 healthy controls completed MRI scanning and IQ, depression, and anxiety assessments. The Scale to Assess Insight-Expanded (SAI-E) measured insight into patients' four most prominent symptoms and patients were classified into two groups: low IS (0-2; n=33), and high IS (>2; n=33). We evaluated the association between cortical thickness (CT) and insight into symptoms using two methods: (1) a between-patients region-of-interest analysis in the insula, superior temporal gyrus (STG) and frontal lobe; and (2) a whole-brain exploratory regression between patient and controls. Brain regions were segmented using a neuroanatomical atlas and vertex-wise CT analyses were conducted with CIVET, covaried for age and sex. ROI analysis revealed thinner insula cortex in patients with low IS (p < 0.05, surviving FDR correction). Patients with low IS also showed significantly thinner right insula, STG, and parahippocampal cortex compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05, surviving FDR correction). Regions of observed CT reductions have been hypothesized to subserve self-monitoring, error awareness, and ability to identify hallucinations. Results highlight an important association between right insula abnormalities and impaired IS in schizophrenia. The diverse clinical presentation of patients further suggests an independent relationship between symptomology and insight-related differences in CT that has been previously unexplored in enduring schizophrenia.

This study compared cortical thickness and structural connectivity linked to the DMN in patients with persistent insomnia (PI) and good sleepers (GS). Methods: The current study used a clinical subsample from the longitudinal community-based Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). Cortical thickness and structural connectivity linked to the DMN in patients with persistent insomnia symptoms (PIS; n = 57) were compared to good sleepers (GS; n = 40). All participants underwent MRI acquisition. Based on literature review, we selected cortical regions corresponding to the DMN. A seed-based structural covariance analysis measured cortical thickness correlation between each seed region of the DMN and other cortical areas. Association of cortical thickness and covariance with sleep quality and neuropsychological assessments were further assessed. Results: Compared to GS, cortical thinning was found in PIS in the anterior cingulate cortex, precentral cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex. Decreased structural connectivity between anterior and posterior regions of the DMN was observed in the PIS group. Decreased structural covariance within the DMN was associated with higher PSQI scores. Cortical thinning in the lateral frontal lobe was related to poor performance in executive function in PIS. Conclusion: Disrupted structural covariance network in PIS might reflect malfunctioning of antero-posterior disconnection of the DMN during the wake to sleep transition that is commonly found during normal sleep. The observed structural network alteration may further implicate commonly observed sustained sleep difficulties and cognitive impairment in insomnia.

This is the first study to examine the effects of 3D-MOT training on attention, working memory, and visual information processing speed as well as using functional brain imaging on a normative population. Twenty university-aged students were recruited and divided into a training (NT) and nonactive control (CON) group.

Somatosensory rehabilitation is a novel, nonpharmacological intervention described by Spicher based on the neuroplasticity of the somatosensory system. The rationale for somatosensory rehabilitation is that treating hypoesthesia will decrease neuropathic pain. Particularly for those with established neuropathic pain, the hypoesthesia may be masked by mechanical allodynia, which must be treated before treating the underlying hyposensitive zone. This case series describes the outcome of 17 burn survivors treated with somatosensory rehabilitation for their neuropathic pain. Before initiating treatment a modified version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire-short form (Questionnaire de la douleur St. Antoine, QDSA) was completed with the patients. The total score (x/64) was converted to percentage. The mechanical allodynia was assessed with the Rainbow Pain Scale that uses touch with the 15-g Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments (SWMs) and that was rated as painful on the visual analog scale (3/10 or resting pain + 1/10), as the criteria for mechanical allodynia. The severity level was assessed using seven predetermined SWMs to identify the smallest that elicited pain. The treatment consisted of avoiding all touch in the allodynic zone while concurrently providing proximal sensory and vibratory counter stimulation. Once the mechanical allodynia was eliminated, the underlying hypoesthesia was treated. Hypoesthesia was evaluated with the SWMs, and the percent improvement from baseline was calculated. The sensory reeducation treatment for hypoesthesia consisted of touch discrimination, texture perception, and vibratory stimulation. Seventeen patients (71/29% male/female, 21 +/- 25% TBSA burned, 486 +/- 596 days postburn) were evaluated and treated. Of these 15 initially presented with mechanical allodynia. The SWM scores had improved by 27 +/- 21% (n = 14) and 29 +/- 26% (n = 12) at 2 and 3 months posttreatment, respectively. The QDSA scores had improved by 9 +/- 14% (n = 8) and 23 +/- 23% (n = 6) at 2 and 3 months posttreatment, respectively. There were two patients who initially presented with hypoesthesia and six who had their zone of hypoesthesia treated after the mechanical allodynia had resolved. For these eight patients, their ability to perceive light touch improved by 27 +/- 17% (n = 8) and 35 +/- 25% (n = 6) at 2 and 3 months postsensory reeducation treatment initiation, respectively. The QDSA improved by 9 and 50% for the two patients who initially presented with hypoesthesia. In this case series, the majority of patients (13/17 or 76%) showed substantial improvements after somatosensory rehabilitation suggesting this is a treatment approach that should be considered with burn survivors experiencing neuropathic pain. There is a need, however, for future controlled studies to further investigate this approach and to determine if there is a subpopulation of burn survivors that are more likely than others to benefit from this approach.

Accumulating experimental, clinical and epidemiological data has provided support for the chemopreventive properties of olive oil compounds traditionally found within the Mediterranean diet. In this study, we investigated whether tyrosol (Tyr), hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein and oleic acid (OA), four compounds contained in extra virgin olive oil, can prevent tumor necrosis factor (TNE)-alpha-induced expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (an inflammation biomarlcer) in a human glioblastoma cell (U-87 MG) model. We found that Tyr and OA significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced COX-2 gene and protein expression, as well as PGE(2) secretion. Both compounds also inhibited TNF-alpha-induced JNK and ERK phosphorylation, whereas only Tyr inhibited TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B phosphorylation. Paracrine-regulated migration of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) was assessed using growth factor-enriched conditioned media (CM) isolated from U-87 MG cells. We found that while PGE2 triggered HBMEC migration, the CM isolated from U-87 MG cells, where either COX-2 or NF-kappa B had been silenced or had been treated with Tyr or OA, exhibited decreased chemotactic properties. These observations demonstrate that olive oil compounds inhibit the effect of the chronic inflammatory microenvironment on glioblastoma progression through TNF-alpha actions and may be useful in cancer chemoprevention.

Yet the exact biological processes leading to changes in covariance, and the relation between such covariance and behavior, remain largely unexplored. The steroid hormone testosterone represents a compelling mechanism through which this structural covariance may be developmentally regulated in humans. Although steroid hormone receptors can be found throughout the central nervous system, the amygdala represents a key target for testosterone-specific effects, given its high density of androgen receptors. In addition, testosterone has been found to impact cortical thickness (CTh) across the whole brain, suggesting that it may also regulate the structural relationship, or covariance, between the amygdala and CTh. Here, we examined testosterone-related covariance between amygdala volumes and whole-brain CTh, as well as its relationship to aggression levels, in a longitudinal sample of children, adolescents, and young adults 6-22 years old. We found: (1) testosterone-specific modulation of the covariance between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); (2) a significant relationship between amygdala-mPFC covariance and levels of aggression; and (3) mediation effects of amygdala-mPFC covariance on the relationship between testosterone and aggression. These effects were independent of sex, age, pubertal stage, estradiol levels and anxious-depressed symptoms. These findings are consistent with prior evidence that testosterone targets the neural circuits regulating affect and impulse regulation, and show, for the first time in humans, how androgen-dependent organizational effects may regulate a very specific, aggression-related structural brain phenotype from childhood to young adulthood.

Facebook behaviors associated with diurnal cortisol in adolescents: Is befriending stressful?

Despite great interest in psychology and sociology, little is known about Facebook behaviors in relation to physiological markers of stress. Given that the brain undergoes important development during adolescence and that glucocorticoids-a major class of stress hormones-are known to modulate its development, it is important to study psychosocial factors that may influence secretion of stress hormones during adolescence. The goal of the present study was to explore the associations between Facebook behaviors (use frequency, network size, self-presentation and peer-interaction) and basal levels of cortisol among adolescent boys and girls. Eighty-eight adolescents (41 boys, 47 girls) aged between 12 and 17(14.5 +/- 1.8) were recruited. Participants provided four cortisol samples per day for two non-consecutive weekdays. Facebook behaviors were assessed in accordance with the existing literature. Well-validated measures of perceived stress, perceived social support, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms were also included. A hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for sex, age, time of awakening, perceived stress, and perceived social support, cortisol systemic output (area under the curve with respect to ground) was positively associated with the number of Facebook friends and negatively associated with Facebook peer-interaction. No associations were found among depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and cortisol. These results provide preliminary evidence that Facebook behaviors are associated with diurnal cortisol concentrations in adolescents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

And yet, surprisingly few psychoneuroendocrine studies actually assess within-sex variations of testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone when investigating sex-specific activities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In this methodological study of 204 healthy adults (60 men), we assessed whether cortisol profiles would differ between the sexes when unadjusted or adjusted for basal sex hormones among both sexes. Reactive cortisol was sampled using 6 saliva samples measured every 10-min as part of the Trier Social Stress Test that generally activates cortisol among men more than women. Diurnal cortisol was sampled over two days at (1) awakening, (2) 30-min thereafter, (3) 1400 h, (4) 1600 h, and (5) bedtime. Sex hormones were collected at baseline before the psychosocial stressor and on two occasions during diurnal cortisol assessment. Repeated-measures analysis of covariance controlled for key covariates in analyses unadjusted or adjusted for sex hormones. Results revealed that men had higher reactive cortisol than women in unadjusted analysis, but this sex difference was attenuated when adjusting for sex hormones. While diurnal cortisol showed no sex differences in unadjusted models, adjusting for sex hormones revealed that women have higher morning cortisol. Correlations using area under the curve formulae revealed intriguing sex-specific associations with progesterone in men and testosterone in women that we propose have implications for social and affective neuroscience. In summary, our results reveal that adjusting for sex hormones alters "sex-specific" reactive and diurnal cortisol profiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects refer to decreased poorer strategy effects (i.e., poorer performance when the cued strategy is not the best) on current problem following poorer strategy problems compared to after better strategy problems. Analyses on electrophysiological (EEG) data revealed important age-related changes in time, frequency, and coherence of brain activities underlying sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects. More specifically, sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects were associated with earlier and later time windows (i.e., between 200- and 550 ms and between 850- and 1250 ms). Event-related potentials (ERPs) also revealed an earlier onset in older adults, together with more anterior and less lateralized activations. Furthermore, sequential modulations of poorer strategy effects were associated with theta and alpha frequencies in young adults while these modulations were found in delta frequency and theta inter-hemispheric coherence in older adults, consistent with qualitatively distinct patterns of brain activity. These findings have important implications to further our understanding of age-related differences and similarities in sequential modulations of cognitive control processes during arithmetic strategy execution.

However, it is unclear whether neurodegenerative and resultant clinical trajectories are accelerated inMCIpatients with concomitant depressive symptoms, leading to a faster conversion to dementia stages than those who are not depressed. No longitudinal study has investigated whether depressed amnestic MCI (DEP+aMCI) patients show an earlier onset of progression to dementia than non-depressed amnestic MCI (DEP-aMCI) patients and whether progressive hippocampal volume reductions are related in the conversion process. Using data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we examined 2-year follow-up data from 38 DEP+aMCI patients and 38 matched DEP-aMCI patients and compared their ages of conversion from aMCI to AD and trajectories of progressive hippocampal volume changes. DEP+ and DEP-patients were defined as having baseline Geriatric Depression Scale scores of 5 or above and 0, respectively. DEP+ converters showed earlier ages of conversion to dementia (p = 0.009) and greater left hippocampal volume loss than both DEP-converters and DEP+ non-converters over the 2-year period (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, respectively). These findings could not be explained by changes in total brain volume, differences in their clinical symptoms of dementia, daily functioning, or apolipoprotein E4 genotypes. No difference in conversion rate to dementia or progressive hippocampal volume change was found between DEP+ patients and DEP-patients, which suggested depressive symptoms themselves may not lead to progression of dementia from MCI. In conclusion, there is a synergistic effect of depressive symptoms and smaller left hippocampal volume in MCI patients that accelerates conversion to dementia.

Specifically, evidence that suggests the basal ganglia induces PD tremor via excessive inhibitory output to the thalamus and altered firing patterns which in turn generate rhythmic bursting activity of thalamic cells is presented. Then, evidence that the thalamus generates PD tremor by facilitating the generation and consolidation of rhythmic bursting activity of neurons within its nuclei is also offered. Finally, evidence that the cerebellum may modulate characteristics of PD tremor by treating it as if it was a voluntary motor behavior is presented. Accordingly, the current paper proposes that PD tremor is induced by abnormal basal ganglia activity; it is generated by the thalamus, and modulated or reinforced by the cerebellum.

Since stroke recovery relies on brain plastic processes, on which BDNF is permissive, the dominant thought is in favor of a worse recovery in Met carriers. Conversely, we suggest that Met carriers do not differ in terms of absolute ability to recover from stroke, but they do differ on the way they recover. In particular, Met carriers rely more on subcortical plasticity, while ValVal patients more on intracortical plastic processes. Indeed, the direct evidence of impaired Met carrier recovery is inconsistent, as a high worldwide diffusion of the polymorphism suggests. The plasticity taking place in cortex, which is the one targeted by noninvasive brain stimulation strategies aimed at enhancing recovery, is less pronounced in Met carrier stroke patients, who have instead spared global recovery potential. Enhanced subcortical plasticity sustains better stroke recovery of Met carrier mice: this may also happen in humans, explaining the weaker interhemispheric cortical excitability imbalance recently described in Met carriers. Thus, BDNF haplotype determines mechanisms and structures involved in stroke recovery. The less pronounced cortical plasticity of Met carrier implies that plastic changes induced by interventional neurophysiological protocols would be better predictors of ValVal chronic outcome and those protocols would be more effective to boost their recovery. Other strategies, more focused on subcortical mechanisms, should be used in Met carriers.

Activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the adult can be viewed as mostly adaptive to restore homeostasis in the short term. When stress occurs during development, and specifically during periods of vulnerability in maturing systems, it can significantly reprogram function, leading to pathologies in the adult. Thus, it is critical to understand how the HPA axis is regulated during developmental periods and what are the factors contributing to shape its activity and reactivity to environmental stressors. The HPA axis is not a passive system. It can actively participate in critical physiological regulation, inducing parturition in the sheep for instance or being a center stage actor in the preparation of the fetus to aerobic life (lung maturation). It is also a major player in orchestrating mental function, metabolic, and cardiovascular function often reprogrammed by stressors even prior to conception through epigenetic modifications of gametes. In this review, we review the ontogeny of the HPA axis with an emphasis on two species that have been widely studied-sheep and rodents-because they each share many similar regulatory mechanism applicable to our understanding of the human HPA axis. The studies discussed in this review should ultimately inform us about windows of susceptibility in the developing brain and the crucial importance of early preconception, prenatal, and postnatal interventions designed to improve parental competence and offspring outcome. Only through informed studies will our public health system be able to curb the expansion of many stress-related or stress-induced pathologies and forge a better future for upcoming generations.

Forebrain circuits underlying the social modulation of vocal communication signals	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Bengalese finch; birdsong; HVC; sequencing; social context	BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUIT; CONTEXT-DEPENDENT CHANGES; ADULT BENGALESE FINCHES; MALE ZEBRA FINCHES; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; GENE-EXPRESSION; SONG PRODUCTION; MOTOR CONTROL; SEQUENCE VARIABILITY; ZENK EXPRESSION	Across vertebrate species, signalers alter the structure of their communication signals based on the social context. For example, male Bengalese finches produce faster and more stereotyped songs when directing song to females (female-directed [FD] song) than when singing in isolation (undirected [UD] song), and such changes have been found to increase the attractiveness of a male's song. Despite the importance of such social influences, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the social modulation of communication signals. To this end, we analyzed differences in immediate early gene (EGR-1) expression when Bengalese finches produced FD or UD song. Relative to silent birds, EGR-1 expression was elevated in birds producing either FD or UD song throughout vocal control circuitry, including the interface nucleus of the nidopallium (NIf), HVC, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), Area X, and the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN). Moreover, EGR-1 expression was higher in HVC, RA, Area X, and LMAN in males producing UD song than in males producing FD song, indicating that social context modulated EGR-1 expression in these areas. However, EGR-1 expression was not significantly different between males producing FD or UD song in NIf, the primary vocal motor input into HVC, suggesting that context-dependent changes could arise de novo in HVC. The pattern of context-dependent differences in EGR-1 expression in the Bengalese finch was highly similar to that in the zebra finch and suggests that social context affects song structure by modulating activity throughout vocal control nuclei.

Eight regions of the brainstem and hypothalamus were surveyed, including seven previously shown to respond to hypoxia in late-gestation mammalian fetuses (Breen et al., 1997; Nitsos and Walker, 1999b). Hypoxia-related changes in chick embryo brain activation mirrored those found in fetal mammals with the exception of the medullary Raphe, which showed decreased hypoxic activation, compared with no change in mammals. This difference may be explained by the greater anapyrexic responses of chick embryos relative to mammalian fetuses. Activation in the A1/C1 region was examined in more detail to ascertain whether an O-2-sensitive subpopulation of these cells containing heme oxygenase 2 (HMOX2) may drive hypoxic brain responses before the maturation of peripheral O-2-sensing. HMOX2-positive and -negative catecholaminergic cells and interdigitating noncatecholaminergic HMOX2-positive cells all showed significant changes in cFos expression to hypoxia, with larger population responses seen in the catecholaminergic cells. Hypoxia-induced activation of lower-brain regions studied here was significantly better correlated with activation of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) than with that of HMOX2-containing A1/C1 neurons. Together, these observations suggest that (1) the functional circuitry controlling prenatal brain responses to hypoxia is strongly conserved between birds and mammals, and (2) NTS neurons are a more dominant driving force for prenatal hypoxic cFos brain responses than O-2-sensing A1/C1 neurons.

The radiopharmaceutical [C-11]ABP688 allows for in vivo quantification of mGluR5 availability using positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, we aimed to detail the regional distribution of [C-11]ABP688 binding potential (BPND) and the existence of age/sex effects in healthy individuals. Methods Thirty-one healthy individuals aged 20 to 77 years (men, n = 18, 45.3 +/- 18.2 years; females, n = 13, 41.5 +/- 19.6 years) underwent imaging with [C-11]ABP688 using the high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT). We developed an advanced partial volume correction (PVC) method using surface-based analysis in order to accurately estimate the regional variation of radioactivity. BPND was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model, with the cerebellum as the reference region. Surface-based and volume-based analyses were performed for 39 cortical and subcortical regions of interest per hemisphere. Results We found the highest [C-11]ABP688 BPND in the lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. The lowest [C-11]ABP688 BPND was observed in the pre- and post-central gyri as well as the occipital lobes and the thalami. No sex effect was observed. Associations between age and [C-11]ABP688 BPND without PVC were observed in the right amygdala and left putamen, but were not significant after multiple comparisons correction. Conclusions The present results highlight complexities underlying brain adaptations during the aging process, and support the notion that certain aspects of neurotransmission remain stable during the adult life span.

Over the past decade, several divergent genetic pathways have been implicated in the initiation, progression and clinical outcome of this disease. As our understanding of GBM expands and identifies actionable targets specific to individual tumors, there will be a pressing need for the development of new tools that will maximize the use of limited clinical samples to enable the employment of personalized care paradigms. We used PrimePCR validated assays to generate a custom real-time PCR screening panel, containing 74 previously published mRNA targets showing gene expression changes in glioblastoma, and five house-keeping genes. A cohort of 19 frozen brain specimens were analyzed, including WHO Grade II oligodendroglioma (n = 3), WHO Grade II astrocytoma (n = 2), WHO Grade III astrocytoma (n = 1), and glioblastoma (n = 13). Four normal brain samples were also analyzed. We performed RNA extraction, followed by cDNA synthesis, multiplexed pre-amplification and SYBR-based qPCR, to generate expression profiles on all samples. We demonstrated that the workflow shows high tolerance to variation in RNA quality (RIN 8.5-4) and high sensitivity in detection. cDNA input that is equivalent to 3 ng of starting RNA was sufficient to conduct accurate semiquantitative analysis of the panel of 79 assays. Using principal component analysis, we were able to accurately separate glioblastoma from low-grade glioma. The two WHO Grade III tumors analyzed clustered with glioblastoma, but showed more similarity to Grade II gliomas. In this study, we have shown the feasibility of consolidating high-throughput data into a single functional panel capable of accurately classifying glioma specimens based solely on semiquantitative gene expression profiling.

Objective Our objective was to explore the relationship between the incidences of ARIA-H during treatment with placebo and different doses of bapineuzumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid beta. Methods Two neuroradiologists independently reviewed 2572 GRE/T2* MRI sequences from 262 participants in two phase two clinical trials of bapineuzumab and an open-label extension study. Readers were blinded to the participant's therapy, APOE epsilon 4 genotype and medical history. Results Several risk factors for small ARIA-H <10 mm (microhaemorrhages) were identified: APOE epsilon 4, bapineuzumab treatment, pre-existing small ARIA-H and use of antithrombotics. The HR (95% CI) for incident ARIA-H <10 mm associated with the number of APOE epsilon 4 alleles was 11.9 (3.3 to 42.5) for 2 versus no alleles and 3.5 (1.0 to 12.0) for 1 versus no allele. The HR for bapineuzumab therapy was 3.5 (1.0 to 12.0); for the presence of baseline ARIA-H <10 mm, it was 3.5 (1.6 to 7.8), and for the use of antithrombotic agents it was 2.2 (1.0 to 4.8). The incidence rate for ARIA-H <10 mm was elevated only in the initial 6 months of active treatment and declined after this interval to a rate similar to that observed in the group treated with placebo. Conclusions ARIA-H represents a spectrum of MRI findings due to haemosiderin deposition that appears to be related to impaired vascular integrity. The increased risk for ARIA-H associated with APOE epsilon 4 allele frequency, pre-existing ARIA-H, treatment with bapineuzumab and use of antithrombotic agents provides additional support for this hypothesis of loss of integrity of cerebral vessels due to amyloid burden.

J	Karimaghaloo, Z; Arnold, DL; Arbel, T				Karimaghaloo, Zahra; Arnold, Douglas L.; Arbel, Tal			Adaptive multi-level conditional random fields for detection and segmentation of small enhanced pathology in medical images	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Probabilistic graphical models; CRF; Automatic detection and segmentation; Multiple sclerosis; MRI	MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; ENERGY MINIMIZATION; LESIONS; MRI; SCALE	Detection and segmentation of large structures in an image or within a region of interest have received great attention in the medical image processing domains. However, the problem of small pathology detection and segmentation still remains an unresolved challenge due to the small size of these pathologies, their low contrast and variable position, shape and texture. In many contexts, early detection of these pathologies is critical in diagnosis and assessing the outcome of treatment. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic Adaptive Multi-level Conditional Random Fields (AMCRF) with the incorporation of higher order cliques for detecting and segmenting such pathologies. In the first level of our graphical model, a voxel-based CRF is used to identify candidate lesions. In the second level, in order to further remove falsely detected regions, a new CRF is developed that incorporates higher order textural features, which are invariant to rotation and local intensity distortions. At this level, higher order textures are considered together with the voxel-wise cliques to refine boundaries and is therefore adaptive. The proposed algorithm is tested in the context of detecting enhancing Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions in brain MRI, where the problem is further complicated as many of the enhancing voxels are associated with normal structures (i.e. blood vessels) or noise in the MRI. The algorithm is trained and tested on large multi-center clinical trials from Relapsing-Remitting MS patients. The effect of several different parameter learning and inference techniques is further investigated. When tested on 120 cases, the proposed method reaches a lesion detection rate of 90%, with very few false positive lesion counts on average, ranging from 0.17 for very small (3-5 voxels) to 0 for very large (50+ voxels) regions. The proposed model is further tested on a very large clinical trial containing 2770 scans where a high sensitivity of 91% with an average false positive count of 0.5 is achieved. Incorporation of contextual information at different scales is also explored. Finally, superior performance is shown upon comparing with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and variant of an MRF. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, patch-based label fusion approaches have demonstrated state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new patch-based label fusion framework to perform segmentation of anatomical structures. The proposed approach uses an Optimized PAtchMatch Label fusion (OPAL) strategy that drastically reduces the computation time required for the search of similar patches. The reduced computation time of OPAL opens the way for new strategies and facilitates processing on large databases. In this paper, we investigate new perspectives offered by OPAL, by introducing a new multi-scale and multi-feature framework. During our validation on hippocampus segmentation we use two datasets: young adults in the ICBM cohort and elderly adults in the EADC-ADNI dataset. For both, OPAL is compared to state-of-the-art methods. Results show that OPAL obtained the highest median Dice coefficient (89.9% for ICBM and 90.1% for EADC-ADNI). Moreover, in both cases, OPAL produced a segmentation accuracy similar to inter-expert variability. On the EADC-ADNI dataset, we compare the hippocampal volumes obtained by manual and automatic segmentation. The volumes appear to be highly correlated that enables to perform more accurate separation of pathological populations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Role of the dorsal diencephalic conduction system in the brain reward circuitry	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Dorsal raphe; Habenula; Lateral hypothalamus; Reward; Self-stimulation	MEDIAL FOREBRAIN-BUNDLE; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; LATERAL HABENULA; SELF-STIMULATION; BASAL FOREBRAIN; LESIONS; DOPAMINE; MIDBRAIN; NEURONS; RAT	Previous work with psychophysically based studies suggests that electrolytic lesion of the habenula, which lies in the dorsal diencephalic conduction system (DDC), degrades the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). This experiment was aimed at studying the importance of the DDC in brain stimulation reward, and its connections with other areas that support operant responding for brain stimulation. For this purpose, rats were implanted with stimulating electrodes at the dorsal raphe (DR) and lateral hypothalamus (LH), and lesioning electrodes in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) and the DDC. Rats were trained to self-administer the stimulation at three different current intensities and were tested daily for changes in reward thresholds, defined as the pulse frequency required for half-maximal responding. The lesions were done at the DDC and the MFB, and were separated by two weeks interval during which the rats were tested for self-stimulation. At the end of the experiment, rats were transcardially perfused and their brains collected to determine the extent of the lesions and the locations of the stimulation sites. Results show that lesions at both the DDC and MFB produce larger and longer-lasting increases in the reward thresholds (upto 0.40 log(10) units) than lesions at either pathway alone (upto 0.25 log(10) units), and were more effective in attenuating the reward induced by the LH stimulation. These results suggest that there exist two parallel pathways, the MFB and the DDC, which could constitute a viable route for the reward signal triggered by ICSS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Estriol treatment is anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective in preclinical studies. In a small single-arm study of people with multiple sclerosis estriol reduced gadolinium-enhancing lesions and was favourably immunomodulatory. We assessed whether estriol treatment reduces multiple sclerosis relapses in women. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 16 academic neurology centres in the USA, between June 28, 2007, and Jan 9, 2014. Women aged 18-50 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis were randomly assigned (1: 1) with a random permuted block design to either daily oral estriol (8 mg) or placebo, each in combination with injectable glatiramer acetate 20 mg daily. Patients and all study personnel, except for pharmacists and statisticians, were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate after 24 months, with a significance level of p=0.10. Relapses were confirmed by an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale score assessed by an independent physician. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00451204. Findings We enrolled 164 patients: 83 were allocated to the estriol group and 81 were allocated to the placebo group. The annualised confirmed relapse rate was 0.25 relapses per year (95% CI 0.17-0.37) in the estriol group versus 0.37 relapses per year (0.25-0.53) in the placebo group (adjusted rate ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.37-1.05; p=0.077). The proportion of patients with serious adverse events did not differ substantially between the estriol group and the placebo group (eight [10%] of 82 patients vs ten [13%] of 76 patients). Irregular menses were more common in the estriol group than in the placebo group (19 [23%] vs three [4%], p=0.0005), but vaginal infections were less common (one [1%] vs eight [11%], p=0.0117). There were no differences in breast fibrocystic disease, uterine fibroids, or endometrial lining thickness as assessed by clinical examination, mammogram, uterine ultrasound, or endometrial lining biopsy. Interpretation Estriol plus glatiramer acetate met our criteria for reducing relapse rates, and treatment was well tolerated over 24 months. These results warrant further investigation in a phase 3 trial.	[Voskuhl, Rhonda R.; Wang, HeJing; Wu, T. C.

Here we present a collaborative effort led by the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre of the Montreal Neurological Institute, and the Universite de Montreal to build and share a centralised repository to curate MEG data in raw and processed form for open dissemination. The Open MEG Archive (OMEGA, omega.bic.mni.mcgill.ca) is bound to become a continuously expanding repository of multimodal data with a primary focus on MEG, in addition to storing anatomical MRI volumes, demographic participant data and questionnaires, and other forms of electrophysiological data such as EEG. The OMEGA initiative offers both the technological framework for multi-site MEG data aggregation, and serves as one of the largest freely available resting-state and eventually task-related MEG datasets presently available.

The MNI data-sharing and processing ecosystem	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							NEUROIMAGING-DATA; BIG DATA; MRI; PLATFORM; GENETICS; TOOLS; AGE	Neuroimaging has been facing a data deluge characterized by the exponential growth of both raw and processed data. As a result, mining the massive quantities of digital data collected in these studies offers unprecedented opportunities and has become paramount for today's research. As the neuroimaging community enters the world of "Big Data", there has been a concerted push for enhanced sharing initiatives, whether within a multisite study, across studies, or federated and shared publicly. This article will focus on the database and processing ecosystem developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) to support multicenter data acquisition both nationally and internationally, create database repositories, facilitate data-sharing initiatives, and leverage existing software toolkits for large-scale data processing.

The performance capabilities of our two proposed adaptive threshold bands are compared relative to each other as well as with the performance of a fixed threshold bands. To demonstrate and illustrate the capabilities of our proposed FDI methodology, the developed techniques are applied to a high fidelity model of a two wheeled mobile robot that is subject to the most physically possible faults in these systems. The mobile robot is modeled implicitly by utilizing two computationally intelligent methodologies. Specifically, locally linear models (LLM) as a neuro-fuzzy technique and a radial basis function as a neural network are used to identify and represent the model of the mobile robot. The resulting improvements in the FDI performance by employing our proposed adaptive threshold bands are demonstrated and illustrated through extensive simulation case studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, pathological mechanisms, such as the accumulation of amyloid and the proliferation of tau, are thought to begin years, even decades, before the initial clinical manifestations of AD. In this study, we compare the brain anatomy of amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients (aMCI, n= 16) to healthy subjects (CS, n = 22) using cortical thickness, subcortical volume, and shape analysis, which we believe to be complimentary to volumetric measures. We were able to replicate "classical" cortical thickness alterations in aMCI in the hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, insula, and inferior temporal regions. Additionally, aMCI showed significant thalamic and striatal shape differences. We observed higher global amyloid deposition in aMCI, a significant correlation between striatal displacement and global amyloid, and an inverse correlation between executive function and right-hemispheric thalamic displacement. In contrast, no volumetric differences were detected in thalamic, striatal, and hippocampal regions. Our results provide new evidence for early subcortical neuroanatomical changes in patients with aMCI, which are linked to cognitive abilities and amyloid deposition. Hence, shape analysis may aid in the identification of structural biomarkers for identifying individuals at highest risk of conversion to AD.

Four groups failed to fully replicate the primary results but the original authors claimed overall support for the general conclusions. Because of its potential clinical importance, the current work studied the effects of bexarotene using two animal species and highly relevant paradigms. Rats were tested for the ability of bexarotene to prevent changes induced by an A beta challenge in the form intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) administration of 7PA2 conditioned medium (7PA2 CM) which contains high levels of A beta species. Bexarotene had no effect on the long-term potentiation of evoked extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials induced by i.c.v. 7PA2 CM. It also had no effect following subcutaneous administration of 2, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg on behavioral/cognitive impairment using an alternating-lever cyclic-ratio schedule of operant responding in the rat. The effects of bexarotene were further tested using the APPSwFILon, PSEN1*M146L*L286V transgenic mouse model of AD, starting at the time A beta deposits first begin to develop. Mice were sacrificed after 48 days of exposure to 100 mg bexarotene per day. No significant difference between test and control mice was found using a water-maze test, and no significant difference in the number of A beta deposits in cerebral cortex, using two different antibodies, was apparent. These results question the potential efficacy of bexarotene for AD treatment, even if instigated in the preclinical period prior to the onset of cognitive deficits reported for human AD.

The perceptual phenomenon of consonance has been traced to the acoustic property of harmonicity. It has been repeatedly shown that neural correlates of consonance can be found as early as the auditory brainstem as reflected in the harmonicity of the scalp-recorded frequency-following response (FFR). "Neural Pitch Salience" (NPS) measured from FFRs-essentially a time-domain equivalent of the classic pattern recognition models of pitch-has been found to correlate with behavioral judgments of consonance for synthetic stimuli. Following the idea that the auditory system has evolved to process behaviorally relevant natural sounds, and in order to test the generalizability of this finding made with synthetic tones, we recorded FFRs for consonant and dissonant intervals composed of synthetic and natural stimuli. We found that NPS correlated with behavioral judgments of consonance and dissonance for synthetic but not for naturalistic sounds. These results suggest that while some form of harmonicity can be computed from the auditory brainstem response, the general percept of consonance and dissonance is not captured by this measure. It might either be represented in the brainstem in a different code (such as place code) or arise at higher levels of the auditory pathway. Our findings further illustrate the importance of using natural sounds, as a complementary tool to fully-controlled synthetic sounds, when probing auditory perception.

The present study examined whether symptom expression in early-onset TS was distinct from that observed in TS with a later onset. We compared the clinical characteristics in children with TS who developed tics before age 4 or after age 6. Early-onset TS was significantly associated with an increased rate of stuttering and other speech disfluencies as well as an increased rate of oppositional defiant disorder, symptoms that often appear before age 4. Early-onset TS was also linked to maternal transmission of tics. Early-onset TS was not significantly associated with tic severity, obsessive-compulsive behavior or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The results suggest that an early onset affects symptom expression in tic disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we aimed at replicating these previous findings by measuring brain activation during the Iowa Gambling Task and an emotional faces viewing task. Participants comprised 15 euthymic suicide attempters (history of depression and suicidal behavior) who were compared with 23 euthymic patient controls (history of depression without suicidal history) and 35 healthy controls. The following five model-based regions of interest were investigated: the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial (MPFC) and dorsal prefrontal cortex (DPFC). Suicide attempters relative to patient controls showed (1) increased response to angry vs. neutral faces in the left OFC and the VLPFC, as previously reported; (2) increased response to wins vs. losses in the right OFC, DPFC and ACC; (3) decreased response to risky vs. safe choices in the left DPFC; and (4) decreased response to sad vs. neutral faces in the right ACC. This study links impaired valuation processing (here for signals of social threat, sadness and reward) to prefrontal cortex dysfunction in suicide attempters. These long-term deficits may underlie the impaired decision-making and social difficulties found in suicide attempters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the precise cellular mechanisms by which p38 regulates OLG differentiation remain largely unknown. To determine whether p38 functions in part through transcriptional events in regulating OLG identity, we performed microarray analysis on differentiating oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) treated with a p38 inhibitor. Consistent with a role in OLG differentiation, pharmacological inhibition of p38 down-regulated the transcription of genes that are involved in myelin biogenesis, transcriptional control and cell cycle. Proliferation assays showed that OLPs treated with the p38 inhibitor retained a proliferative capacity which could be induced upon application of mitogens demonstrating that after two days of p38-inhibition OLGs remained poised to continue mitosis. Together, our results suggest that the p38 pathway regulates gene transcription which can coordinate OLG differentiation. Our microarray dataset will provide a useful resource for future studies investigating the molecular mechanisms by which p38 regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.

Previous studies have demonstrated the role of VCP mutations in altering the ATPase activity of the D2 ring; however the structural consequences of these mutations remain unclear. In this study, we report the three-dimensional (3D) map of the pathogenic VCP variant, R155P, as revealed by single-particle Cryo-Electron Microscopy (EM) analysis at 14 A resolution. We show that the N-terminal R155P mutation induces a large structural reorganisation of the D2 ATPase ring. Results from docking studies using crystal structure data of available wild-type VCP in the EM density maps indicate that the major difference is localized at the interface between two protomers within the D2 ring. Consistent with a conformational change, the VCP R155P variant shifted the isoelectric point of the protein and reduced its interaction with its well-characterized cofactor, nuclear protein localization-4 (Npl4). Together, our results demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution in the N-terminal domain can relay long-range conformational changes to the distal D2 ATPase ring. Our results provide the first structural clues of how VCP mutations may influence the activity and function of the D2 ATPase ring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) have shown limited reproducibility as they have had small sample sizes and substantial variation in study protocol. We sought to identify functional brain networks and connections that could consistently discriminate normal aging from aMCI despite variations in scanner manufacturer, imaging protocol, and diagnostic procedure. We therefore combined four datasets collected independently, including 112 healthy controls and 143 patients with aMCI. We systematically tested multiple brain connections for associations with aMCI using a weighted average routinely used in meta-analyses. The largest effects involved the superior medial frontal cortex (including the anterior cingulate), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, striatum, and middle temporal lobe. Compared with controls, patients with aMCI exhibited significantly decreased connectivity between default mode network nodes and between regions of the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. Despite the heterogeneity of methods among the four datasets, we identified common aMCI-related connectivity changes with small to medium effect sizes and sample size estimates recommending a minimum of 140 to upwards of 600 total subjects to achieve adequate statistical power in the context of a multisite study with 5-10 scanning sites and about 10 subjects per group and per site. If our findings can be replicated and associated with other established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (e.g., amyloid and tau quantification), then these functional connections may be promising candidate biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.

However, potential roles of B cells in progressive forms of disease continue to be debated. Prior work indicates that presence of B cells is fostered within the inflamed MS central nervous system (CNS) environment, and that B cell-rich immune cell collections may be present within the meninges of patients. A potential association is reported between such meningeal immune cell collections and the subpial pattern of cortical injury that is now considered important in progressive disease. Elucidating the characteristics of B cells that populate the MS CNS, how they traffic into the CNS and how they may contribute to progressive forms of the disease has become of considerable interest. Here, we will review characteristics of human B cells identified within distinct CNS subcompartments of patients with MS, including the cerebrospinal fluid, parenchymal lesions, and meninges, as well as the relationship between B cell populations identified in these subcompartments and the periphery. We will further describe the different barriers of the CNS and the possible mechanisms of migration of B cells across these barriers. Finally, we will consider the range of human B cell responses (including potential for antibody production, cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation) that may contribute to propagating inflammation and injury cascades thought to underlie MS progression.

Quantitative EEGs produce complex data sets derived from digitally analyzed electrical activity at different frequency bands, at multiple electrode locations, and under different vigilance (eyes open vs. closed) states, resulting in potential feature patterns which may be diagnostically useful, but detectable only with advanced mathematical models. Methods: This paper uses a data mining methodology for classifying EEGs of 53 MDD patients and 43 HVs. This included: (a) pre-processing the data, including cleaning and normalization, applying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map the features into a new feature space; and applying Genetic Algorithm (GA) to identify the most significant features; (b) building predictive models using the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm to discover rules and hidden patterns based on the reduced and mapped features; and (c) evaluating the models based on the accuracy and false positive values on the EEG data of MDD and HV participants. Two categories of experiments were performed. The first experiment analyzed each frequency band individually, while the second experiment analyzed the bands together. Results: Application of LDA and GA markedly reduced the total number of utilized features by >= 50 % and, with all frequency bands analyzed together, the model showed average classification accuracy (MDD vs. HV) of 80 %. The best results from model testing with additional test EEG recordings from 9 MDD patients and 35 HV individuals demonstrated an accuracy of 80 % and showed an average sensitivity of 70 %, a specificity of 76 %, and a positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 74 and 75 %, respectively.

We have developed a technique that allows for quantitation of protein levels in single cells in vivo. This protein quantitation ratioing (PQR) technique uses a genetic tag that produces a stoichiometric ratio of a fluorescent protein reporter and the protein of interest during protein translation. The fluorescence intensity is proportional to the number of molecules produced of the protein of interest and is usedtodetermine the relative amount of protein within the cell. We use PQR to quantify protein expression of different genes using quantitative imaging, electrophysiology, and phenotype. We use genome editing to insert Protein Quantitation Reporters into endogenous genomic loci in three different genomes for quantitation of endogenous protein levels. The PQR technique will allow for a wide range of quantitative experiments examining gene-to-phenotype relationships with greater accuracy.

However, extensive characterization of IHI in a large sample has not yet been performed. Furthermore, it is unclear whether IHI are restricted to the medial-temporal lobe or are associated with more extensive anatomical changes. Here, we studied the characteristics of IHI in a community based sample of 2008 subjects of the IMAGEN database and their association with extra-hippocampal anatomical variations. The presence of IHI was assessed on Ti-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using visual criteria. We assessed the association of IHI with other anatomical changes throughout the brain using automatic morphometry of cortical sulci. We found that IHI were much more frequent in the left hippocampus (left: 17%, right: 6%, chi(2) - test, p < 10(-28)). Compared to subjects without IHI, subjects with IHI displayed morphological changes in several sulci located mainly in the limbic lobe. Our results demonstrate that IHI are a common left-sided phenomenon in normal subjects and that they are associated with morphological changes outside the medial temporal lobe.

In a first experiment, we determine which subtype(s) of NT receptors is/are involved in the reward-inducing effect of ventral midbrain microinjection of NT using the conditioned place-preference (CPP) paradigm. In a second study, we used in vitro patch clamp recording technique to characterize the NT receptor subtype(s) involved in the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission (excitatory post-synaptic current, EPSC) in ventral tegmental neurons that expressed (l(h)(+)), or do not express (l(h)(-)), a hyperpolarization-activated cationic current. Behavioral studies were performed with adult male Long Evans rats while electrophysiological recordings were obtained from brain slices of rat pups aged between 14 and 21 days. Results show that bilateral ventral midbrain microinjections of 1.5 and 3 nmol of D-Tyr[(11)]NT induced a CPP that was respectively attenuated or blocked by co-injection with 1.2 nmol of the NTS1/NTS2 antagonist, SR142948, and the preferred NTS1 antagonist, SR48692. In electrophysiological experiments, D-Tyr[(11)]NT (0.01-0.5 mu M) attenuated glutamatergic EPSC in l(h)(+) but enhanced it in l(h)(-) neurons. The attenuation effect (l(h)(+) neurons) was blocked by SR142948 (0.1 mu M) while the enhancement effect (l(h)(-) neurons) was blocked by both antagonists (0.1 mu M). These findings suggest that (i) NT is acting on ventral midbrain NTS1 receptors to induce a rewarding effect and (ii) that this psychostimulant-like effect could be due to a direct action of NT on dopamine neurons and/or an enhancement of glutamatergic inputs to non dopamine (l(h)(-)) neurons.

Thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical circuits generate oscillations at different frequencies during spontaneous activity. However, it remains unclear how the various rhythms interact and whether their interactions are lamina-specific. Here we investigated intra- and inter-laminar spontaneous phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). We recorded local-field potentials using laminar probes inserted in the forelimb representation of rat area Si. We then computed time-series of frequency-band- and lamina-specific current source density (CSD), and PACs of CSD for all possible pairs of the classical frequency bands in the range of 1-150 Hz. We observed both intra- and inter-laminar spontaneous PAC. Of 18 possible combinations, 12 showed PAC, with the highest measures of interaction obtained for the pairs of the theta/gamma and delta/gamma bands. Intra- and inter-laminar PACs involving layers 2/3-5a were higher than those involving layer 6. Current sinks (sources) in the delta band were associated with increased (decreased) amplitudes of high-frequency signals in the beta to fast gamma bands throughout layers 2/3-6. Spontaneous sinks (sources) of the theta and alpha bands in layers 2/3-4 were on average linked to dipoles completed by sources (sinks) in layer 6, associated with high (low) amplitudes of the beta to fast-gamma bands in the entire cortical column. Our findings show that during spontaneous activity, delta, theta, and alpha oscillations are associated with periodic excitability, which for the theta and alpha bands is lamina-dependent. They further emphasize the differences between the function of layer 6 and that of the superficial layers, and the role of layer 6 in controlling activity in those layers. Our study links theories on the involvement of PAC in resting state functional connectivity with previous work that revealed lamina-specific anatomical thalamo-cortico-cortical connections.

These experiences have long remained difficult to explain, but current progress in cognitive neuroscience and psychoanalysis sheds light on the contexts in which they emerge, as well as on their underlying processes. Following a brief description of the different types of anomalous experiences, we underline how they can be better understood at the frontiers between psychoanalysis and cognitive neurosciences. In this regard, three main lines of research are discussed and illustrated, alongside clinical cases which come from a clinical service specializing in anomalous experiences. First, we study the links between anomalous experiences and hallucinatory processes, by showing that anomalous experiences frequently occur as a specific reaction to negative life events, in which case they mainly take the form of non-pathological hallucinations. Next, we propose to analyze these experiences from the perspective of their traumatic aspects and the altered states of consciousness they often imply. Finally, these experiences are considered to be the consequence of a hypersensitivity that can be linked to an increase in psychic permeability. In conclusion, these different processes lead us to consider anomalous experiences as primary forms of symbolization and transformation of the subjective experience, especially during, or after traumatic situations.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which mTOR regulates nociception remain unclear. Here we show that deletion of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a major mTOR downstream effector, which represses elF4E activity and cap-dependent translation, leads to mechanical, but not thermal pain hypersensitivity. Mice lacking 4E-BP1 exhibit enhanced spinal cord expression of neuroligin 1, a cell-adhesion postsynaptic protein regulating excitatory synapse function, and show increased excitatory synaptic input into spinal neurons, and a lowered threshold for induction of synaptic potentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of elF4E or genetic reduction of neuroligin 1 levels normalizes the increased excitatory synaptic activity and reverses mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus, translational control by 4E-BP1 downstream of mTOR effects the expression of neuroligin 1 and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord, and thereby contributes to enhanced mechanical nociception.

Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown relation between abnormal/altered dynamics in these circuits and male sexual dysfunction. However, alterations in the topological(1) organization of structural brain networks in male sexual dysfunction are still unclear. Here, we used graph theory(2) to investigate the topological properties of large-scale structural brain networks, which were constructed using inter-regional correlations of cortical thickness between 78 cortical regions in 40 patients with psychogenic erectile dysfunction (pED) and 39 normal controls. Compared with normal controls, pED patients exhibited a less optimal global topological organization with reduced global and increased local efficiencies. Our results suggest disrupted neural integration among distant brain regions in pED patients, consistent with previous reports of impaired white matter structure and abnormal functional integrity in pED. Additionally, disrupted global network topology in pED was observed to be primarily relevant to altered subnetwork and nodal properties within the networks mediating the cognitive, motivational and inhibitory processes of male SA, possibly indicating disrupted integration of these networks in the whole brain networks and might account for pED patients' abnormal cognitive, motivational and inhibitory processes for male SA. In total, our findings provide evidence for disrupted integrity in large-scale brain networks underlying the neurobehavioral processes of male SA in pED and provide new insights into the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of pED.

Induction of Neuronal Morphology in the 661W Cone Photoreceptor Cell Line with Staurosporine	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; DIFFERENTIATED RGC-5 CELLS; MEDIATED DEATH; TRANSGENIC MICE; APOPTOSIS; GLUTAMATE; TUMORS	Purpose RGC-5 cells undergo differentiation into a neuronal phenotype with low concentrations of staurosporine. Although the RGC-5 cell line was initially thought to be of retinal ganglion cell origin, recent evidence suggests that the RGC-5 line could have been the result of contamination with 661W mouse cone photoreceptor cells. This raised the possibility that a cone photoreceptor cell line could be multipotent and could be differentiated to a neuronal phenotype. Methods 661W and RGC-5 cells, non-neuronal retinal astrocytes, retinal endothelial cells, retinal pericytes, M21 melanoma cells, K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, and Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cells, were differentiated with staurosporine. The resulting morphology was quantitated using NeuronJ with respect to neurite counts and topology. Results Treatment with staurosporine induced similar-appearing morphological differentiation in both 661W and RGC-5 cells. The following measures were not significantly different between 661W and RGC-5 cells: number of neurites per cell, total neurite field length, number of neurite branch points, and cell viability. Neuronal-like differentiation was not observed in the other cell lines tested. Conclusions 661W and RGC-5 cells have virtually identical and distinctive morphology when differentiated with low concentrations of staurosporine. This result demonstrates that a retinal neuronal precursor cell with cone photoreceptor lineage can be differentiated to express a neuronal morphology.

Among these tools are nanoparticle-based probes and sensors that detect biochemical and physiological properties of neurons and glia, and generate signals proportionate to physical, chemical, and/or electrical changes in these cells. In this context, quantum dots (QDs), carbon-based structures (C-dots, grapheme, and nanodiamonds) and gold nanoparticles are the most commonly used nanostructures. They can detect and measure enzymatic activities of proteases (metalloproteinases, caspases), ions, metabolites, and other biomolecules under physiological or pathological conditions in neural cells. Here, we provide some examples of nanoparticle-based and genetically engineered probes and sensors that are used to reveal changes in protease activities and calcium ion concentrations. Although significant progress in developing these tools has been made for probing neural cells, several challenges remain. We review many common hurdles in sensor development, while highlighting certain advances. In the end, we propose some future directions and ideas for developing practical tools for neural cell investigations, based on the maxim "Measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so" (Galileo Galilei).

Selective REM Sleep Deprivation Improves Expectation-Related Placebo Analgesia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CLONIDINE; PAIN; RESPONSES; BRAIN; REWARD; HUMANS; SUPPRESSION; EXPERIENCE	The placebo effect is a neurobiological and psychophysiological process known to influence perceived pain relief. Optimization of placebo analgesia may contribute to the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of medication for acute and chronic pain management. We know that the placebo effect operates through two main mechanisms, expectations and learning, which is also influenced by sleep. Moreover, a recent study suggested that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is associated with modulation of expectation-mediated placebo analgesia. We examined placebo analgesia following pharmacological REM sleep deprivation and we tested the hypothesis that relief expectations and placebo analgesia would be improved by experimental REM sleep deprivation in healthy volunteers. Following an adaptive night in a sleep laboratory, 26 healthy volunteers underwent classical experimental placebo analgesic conditioning in the evening combined with pharmacological REM sleep deprivation (clonidine: 13 volunteers or inert control pill: 13 volunteers). Medication was administered in a double-blind manner at bedtime, and placebo analgesia was tested in the morning. Results revealed that 1) placebo analgesia improved with REM sleep deprivation; 2) pain relief expectations did not differ between REM sleep deprivation and control groups; and 3) REM sleep moderated the relationship between pain relief expectations and placebo analgesia. These results support the putative role of REM sleep in modulating placebo analgesia. The mechanisms involved in these improvements in placebo analgesia and pain relief following selective REM sleep deprivation should be further investigated.

Activity within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system has been traditionally associated with decision-making. The endocannabinoid system through its actions on inhibitory and excitatory synapses modulates dopamine activity and decision making. The aim of this brief review is to present a synopsis of available data obtained when the endocannabinoid system is manipulated and dopamine activity recorded. To this end, we review research using different behavioral paradigms to provide further insight into how this ubiquitous signaling system biases dopamine related behaviors to regulate decision-making.

Evidence for Enhanced Interoceptive Accuracy in Professional Musicians	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						interoception; musicians; insula; multisensory integration; heartbeat perception	PERFORMANCE ANXIETY; CHRONIC PAIN; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; HEARTBEAT DETECTION; PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION; EXPERIENCED MEDITATORS; ADOLESCENT MUSICIANS; SENSORIMOTOR CONTROL; DELIBERATE PRACTICE; SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS	Interoception is defined as the perceptual activity involved in the processing of internal bodily signals. While the ability of internal perception is considered a relatively stable trait, recent data suggest that learning to integrate multisensory information can modulate it. Making music is a uniquely rich multisensory experience that has shown to alter motor, sensory, and multimodal representations in the brain of musicians. We hypothesize that musical training also heightens interoceptive accuracy comparable to other perceptual modalities. Thirteen professional singers, twelve string players, and thirteen matched non-musicians were examined using a well-established heartbeat discrimination paradigm complemented by self-reported dispositional traits. Results revealed that both groups of musicians displayed higher interoceptive accuracy than non-musicians, whereas no differences were found between singers and string-players. Regression analyses showed that accumulated musical practice explained about 49% variation in heartbeat perception accuracy in singers but not in string-players. Psychometric data yielded a number of psychologically plausible inter correlations in musicians related to performance anxiety. However, dispositional traits were not a confounding factor on heartbeat discrimination accuracy. Together, these data provide first evidence indicating that professional musicians show enhanced interoceptive accuracy compared to non musicians We argue that musical training largely accounted for this effect.

Although it is now widely accepted that the brain can metabolize lactate, few studies have directly measured brain lactate following vigorous exercise. Here, we used ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain to obtain static measures of brain lactate, as well as brain glutamate and glutamine after vigorous exercise. The aims of our experiment were to (a) track the changes in brain lactate following recovery from exercise, and (b) to simultaneously measure the signals from brain glutamate and glutamine. The results of our experiment showed that vigorous exercise resulted in a significant increase in brain lactate. Furthermore, both glutamate and glutamine were successfully resolved, and as expected, although contrary to some previous reports, we did not observe any significant change in either amino acid after exercise. We did however observe a negative correlation between glutamate and a measure of fitness. These results support the hypothesis that peripherally derived lactate is taken up by the brain when available. Our data additionally highlight the potential of ultra-high field MRS as a non-invasive way of measuring multiple brain metabolite changes with exercise.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by pragmatic difficulties that are best captured by less structured tasks. To this end we tested adults with ASD who did not have language or intellectual impairments, and neurotypical comparison participants in a referential communication task. Participants were directors, describing unlexicalized, complex novel stimuli over repeated rounds of interaction. Group comparisons with respect to referential efficiency showed that directors with ASD demonstrated typical lexical entrainment: they became faster over repeated rounds and used shortened referential forms. ASD and neurotypical groups did not differ with respect to the number of descriptors they provided or the number of exchanges needed for matchers to identify figures. Despite these similarities the ASD group was slightly slower overall. We examined partner-specific effects by manipulating the common ground shared with the matcher. As expected, neurotypical directors maintained referential precedents when speaking to the same matcher but not with a new matcher. Directors with ASD were qualitatively similar but displayed a less pronounced distinction between matchers. However, significant differences and different patterns of reference emerged over time: neurotypical directors incorporated the new matcher's contributions into descriptions, whereas directors with ASD were less likely to do so.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; WECHSLER INTELLIGENCE SCALE; LONG-TERM STABILITY; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; CHILDREN-3RD EDITION; DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER; PROCESSING SPEED; MOTOR IMPAIRMENT; FOLLOW-UP; AGE	The cognitive profile and measured intellectual level vary according to assessment tools in children on the autism spectrum, much more so than in typically developing children. The recent inclusion of intellectual functioning in the diagnostic process for autism spectrum disorders leads to the crucial question on how to assess intelligence in autism, especially as some tests and subtests seem more sensitive to certain neurodevelopmental conditions. Our first aim was to examine the cognitive profile on the current version of the most widely used test, the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-IV), for a homogenous subgroup of children on the autism spectrum, i.e. corresponding to DSM-IV diagnosis of "autism". The second aim was to compare cognitive profiles obtained on the third edition versus 4th edition of WISC, in order to verify whether the WISC-IV yields a more distinctive cognitive profile in autistic children. The third aim was to examine the impact of the WISC-IV on the cognitive profile of another subgroup, children with Asperger's Syndrome. 51 autistic, 15 Asperger and 42 typically developing children completed the WISC-IV and were individually matched to children who completed the WISC-III. Divergent WISC-IV profiles were observed despite no significant intelligence quotient difference between groups. Autistic children scored significantly higher on the Perceptual Reasoning Index than on the Verbal Comprehension Index, a discrepancy that nearly tripled in comparison to WISC-III results. Asperger children scored higher on the VCI than on other indexes, with the lowest score found on the Processing Speed Index. WISC-IV cognitive profiles were consistent with, but more pronounced than WISC-III profiles. Cognitive profiles are a valuable diagnostic tool for differential diagnosis, keeping in mind that children on the autism spectrum might be more sensitive to the choice of subtests used to assess intelligence.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	PLOS ONE			English	Review							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SURGICAL METHODS; COMPLICATIONS; SURGERY; DECOMPRESSION; RISK	Background The Endoscopic Release of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (ECTR) is a minimal invasive approach for the treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. There is scepticism regarding the safety of this technique, based on the assumption that this is a rather "blind" procedure and on the high number of severe complications that have been reported in the literature. Purpose To evaluate whether there is evidence supporting a higher risk after ECTR in comparison to the conventional open release. Methods We searched MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2013), the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register ( November 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, issue 11 in The Cochrane Library). We hand-searched reference lists of included studies. We included all randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (e.g. study using alternation, date of birth, or case record number) that compare any ECTR with any OCTR technique. Safety was assessed by the incidence of major, minor and total number of complications, recurrences, and re-operations. The total time needed before return to work or to return to daily activities was also assessed. We synthesized data using a random- effects meta-analysis in STATA. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for rare events using binomial likelihood. We judged the conclusiveness of meta-analysis calculating the conditional power of meta-analysis. Conclusions ECTR is associated with less time off work or with daily activities. The assessment of major complications, reoperations and recurrence of symptoms does not favor either of the interventions. There is an uncertain advantage of ECTR with respect to total minor complications (more transient paresthesia but fewer skin-related complications). Future studies are unlikely to alter these findings because of the rarity of the outcome. The effect of a learning curve might be responsible for reduced recurrences and reoperations with ECTR in studies that are more recent, although formal statistical analysis failed to provide evidence for such an association.

Particularly, early-onset blindness may trigger profound brain alterations that affect not only the visual system but also the remaining sensory systems. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows in-vivo visualization of brain white matter connectivity, and has been extensively used to study brain white matter structure. Among statistical approaches based on DTI, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) is widely used because of its ability to automatically perform whole brain white matter studies. Tract specific analysis (TSA) is a more recent method that localizes changes in specific white matter bundles. In the present study, we compare TBSS and TSA results of DTI scans from 12 early blind individuals and 13 age-matched sighted controls, with two aims: (a) to investigate white matter alterations associated with early visual deprivation; (b) to examine the relative sensitivity of TSA when compared with TBSS, for both deficit and hypertrophy of white matter microstructures. Both methods give consistent results for broad white matter regions of deficits. However, TBSS does not detect hypertrophy of white matter, whereas TSA shows a higher sensitivity in detecting subtle differences in white matter colocalized to the posterior parietal lobe.

Integration of Th17-and Lymphotoxin-Derived Signals Initiates Meningeal-Resident Stromal Cell Remodeling to Propagate Neuroinflammation	IMMUNITY			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; FIBROBLASTIC RETICULAR CELLS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; LYMPHOID FOLLICLES; DENDRITIC CELLS; B-CELLS; BETA; DISEASE; SYSTEM; DEMYELINATION	Tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLTs) have been observed in the meninges of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, but the stromal cells and molecular signals that support TLTs remain unclear. Here, we show that T helper 17 (Th17) cells induced robust TLTs within the brain meninges that were associated with local demyelination during experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Th17-cell-induced TLTs were underpinned by a network of stromal cells producing extracellular matrix proteins and chemokines, enabling leukocytes to reside within, rather than simply transit through, the meninges. Within the CNS, interactions between lymphotoxin ab (LT alpha beta) on Th17 cells and LT beta R on meningeal radio-resistant cells were necessary for the propagation of de novo interleukin-17 responses, and activated T cells from MS patients expressed elevated levels of LTbR ligands. Therefore, input from both Th17 cells and the lymphotoxin pathway induce the formation of an immune-competent stromal cell niche in the meninges.

Engaging the diverse stakeholders in the research process using community-based participatory research (CBPR) can accelerate biomarker discovery into clinical applications. However, there are limited examples of stakeholder involvement in autism research, possibly due to conceptual and practical concerns. We evaluate the applicability of CBPR principles to biomarker discovery in autism and critically review empirical studies adopting these principles. Methods: Using a scoping review methodology, we identified and evaluated seven studies using CBPR principles in biomarker discovery. Results and conclusions: The limited number of studies in biomarker discovery adopting CBPR principles coupled with their methodological limitations suggests that such applications are feasible but challenging. These studies illustrate three CBPR themes: community assessment, setting global priorities, and collaboration in research design. We propose that further research using participatory principles would be useful in accelerating the pace of discovery and the development of clinically meaningful biomarkers. For this goal to be successful we advocate for increased attention to previously identified conceptual and methodological challenges to participatory approaches in health research, including improving scientific rigor and developing long-term partnerships among stakeholders.

Multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting techniques have been proposed to decrease the impact of MS lesions in medical image processing, however, most of these methods make the assumption that lesions only affect white matter. Here, we propose a method to fill lesion regions using the patch-based non-local mean (NLM) strategy. The method consists of a hierarchical concentric filling strategy after identification of the lesion region. The lesion is filled iteratively, based on the surrounding tissue intensity, using an onion peel strategy. This concentric technique presents the advantage of preserving the local information and therefore the continuity of the anatomy and does not require identification of any a priori normal brain tissues. The method is first evaluated on 20 healthy subjects with simulated artificial MS lesions where we assessed our technique by measuring the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the images with inpainted lesion and the original healthy images. Second, in order to assess the impact of lesion filling on longitudinal image analyses, we performed a power analysis with sample size estimation to evaluate brain atrophy and ventricular growth in patients with MS. The method was compared to two different publicly available methods (FSL lesion fill and Lesion LEAP) and a more classic method, which fills the region with intensities similar to that of the surrounding healthy white matter tissue or mask the lesions. The proposed method was shown to exceed the other methods in reproducing the fidelity of healthy subject images where the lesions were inpainted. The method also improved the power to detect brain atrophy or ventricular growth by decreasing the sample size by 25% in the presence of MS lesions.

Traditionally, sponges (Porifera) have been interpreted as the sister group to the remaining animals, a hypothesis consistent with the conventional view that the last common animal ancestor was relatively simple and more complex body plans arose later in evolution. However, this premise has recently been challenged by analyses of the genomes of comb jellies (Ctenophora), which, instead, found ctenophores as the sister group to the remaining animals (the "Ctenophora-sister" hypothesis). Because ctenophores are morphologically complex predators with true epithelia, nervous systems, muscles, and guts, this scenario implies these traits were either present in the last common ancestor of all animals and were lost secondarily in sponges and placozoans (Trichoplax) or, alternatively, evolved convergently in comb jellies. Here, we analyze representative datasets from recent studies supporting Ctenophora-sister, including genome-scale alignments of concatenated protein sequences, as well as a genomic gene content dataset. We found no support for Ctenophora-sister and conclude it is an artifact resulting from inadequate methodology, especially the use of simplistic evolutionary models and inappropriate choice of species to root the metazoan tree. Our results reinforce a traditional scenario for the evolution of complexity in animals, and indicate that inferences about the evolution of Metazoa based on the Ctenophora-sister hypothesis are not supported by the currently available data.

In situ evaluation of wastewater discharges and the bioavailability of contaminants to marine biota	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ruditapes philippinarum; Caged system; Wastewater discharges; Biochemical responses; Lysosomal membrane stability; Seasonality; Marine sediment	ELLIPTIO-COMPLANATA MUSSELS; CLAM RUDITAPES-PHILIPPINARUM; LYSOSOMAL MEMBRANE STABILITY; SEDIMENT QUALITY ASSESSMENT; CRAB CARCINUS-MAENAS; MYTILUS-GALLOPROVINCIALIS; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY; COLORIMETRIC DETERMINATION; PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS; MUNICIPAL EFFLUENTS	Marine sediment quality of wastewater discharges areas was determined by using in situ caged clams Ruditapes philippinarum taking into account the seasonality. Clams were caged in sediment directly affected by wastewater discharges at four sites (P1, P2, P3, P4) at the Bay of Cadiz (SW, Spain), and one reference site (P6). Exposure to contaminated sediments was confirmed by measurement of metals and As, PAH, pharmaceutical products and surfactants (SAS) in bottom sediments. Biological effects were determined by following biomarkers of exposure (activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase - EROD, dibenzylfluorescein dealkylase - DBF, glutathione S-transferase - GST, glutathione peroxidase - GPX, glutathione reductase - GR and acetylcholinesterase - AChE), effects (lysosomal membrane stability - LMS, DNA damage and lipid peroxidation - LPO), energy status (total lipids TIT and mitochondrial electron transport MET), and involved in the mode of action of pharmaceutical products (monoamine oxidase activity - MAO, alkali-labile phosphates - ALP levels and cyclooxygenase activity COX). In winter, urban effluents were detoxified by phase I biotransformation (CYP3A-like activity), phase II (GST), and the activation of antioxidant defence enzymes (GR). Urban effluents lead to the detoxification metabolism (CYP1A-like), oxidative effects (LPO and DNA damage), neurotoxicity (AChE) and neuroendocrine disruption (COX and ALP levels) involved in inflammation (P1 and P2) and changes in reproduction as spawning delay (P3 and P4) in clams exposed in summer. Adverse effects on biota exposed to sediment directly affected by wastewater discharges depend on the chemical contamination level and also on the reproductive cycle according to seasonality.

MLL5 Orchestrates a Cancer Self-Renewal State by Repressing the Histone Variant H3.3 and Globally Reorganizing Chromatin	CANCER CELL			English	Article							TUMOR-INITIATING CELLS; STEM-LIKE CELLS; HUMAN GLIOBLASTOMA; PEDIATRIC GLIOBLASTOMA; NEURAL PRECURSORS; MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; MALIGNANT GLIOMA; INTERFERON-GAMMA; GENE-EXPRESSION; DIFFERENTIATION	Mutations in the histone 3 variant H3.3 have been identified in one-third of pediatric glioblastomas (GBMs), but not in adult tumors. Here we show that H3.3 is a dynamic determinant of functional properties in adult GBM. H3.3 is repressed by mixed lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5) in self-renewing GBM cells. MLL5 is a global epigenetic repressor that orchestrates reorganization of chromatin structure by punctuating chromosomes with foci of compacted chromatin, favoring tumorigenic and self-renewing properties. Conversely, H3.3 antagonizes self-renewal and promotes differentiation. We exploited these epigenetic states to rationally identify two small molecules that effectively curb cancer stem cell properties in a preclinical model. Our work uncovers a role for MLL5 and H3.3 in maintaining self-renewal hierarchies in adult GBM.

Besides the major seven-transmembrane (7TM) receptors, the MOR gene codes for alternatively spliced six-transmembrane (6TM) isoforms, the biological and clinical significance of which remains unclear. Here, we show that the otherwise exclusively intracellular localized 6TM-MOR translocates to the plasma membrane upon coexpression with beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (beta(2)-ARs) through an interaction with the fifth and sixth helices of beta(2)-AR. Coexpression of the two receptors in BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells potentiates calcium responses to a 6TM-MOR ligand, and this calcium response is completely blocked by a selective beta(2)-antagonist in BE(2)-C cells, and in trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. Co-administration of 6TM-MOR and beta(2)-AR ligands leads to substantial analgesic synergy and completely reverses opioid-induced hyperalgesia in rodent behavioral models. Together, our results provide evidence that the heterodimerization of 6TM-MOR with beta(2)-AR underlies a molecular mechanism for 6TM cellular signaling, presenting a unique functional responses to opioids. This signaling pathway may contribute to the hyperalgesic effects of opioids that can be efficiently blocked by beta(2)-AR antagonists, providing a new avenue for opioid therapy.

Relationship between the Sequencing and Timing of Vocal Motor Elements in Birdsong	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CONTEXT-DEPENDENT CHANGES; STRIATA VAR. DOMESTICA; BENGALESE FINCH SONG; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; BASAL GANGLIA; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; MUSIC PERFORMANCE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BRAIN; GENERATION	Accurate coordination of the sequencing and timing of motor gestures is important for the performance of complex and evolutionarily relevant behaviors. However, the degree to which motor sequencing and timing are related remains largely unknown. Birdsong is a communicative behavior that consists of discrete vocal motor elements ('syllables') that are sequenced and timed in a precise manner. To reveal the relationship between syllable sequencing and timing, we analyzed how variation in the probability of syllable transitions at branch points, nodes in song with variable sequencing across renditions, correlated with variation in the duration of silent gaps between syllable transitions ('gap durations') for adult Bengalese finch song. We observed a significant negative relationship between transition probability and gap duration: more prevalent transitions were produced with shorter gap durations. We then assessed the degree to which long-term age-dependent changes and acute context-dependent changes to syllable sequencing and timing followed this inverse relationship. Age-but not context-dependent changes to syllable sequencing and timing were inversely related. On average, gap durations at branch points decreased with age, and the magnitude of this decrease was greater for transitions that increased in prevalence than for transitions that decreased in prevalence. In contrast, there was no systematic relationship between acute context-dependent changes to syllable sequencing and timing. Gap durations at branch points decreased when birds produced female-directed courtship song compared to when they produced undirected song, and the magnitude of this decrease was not related to the direction and magnitude of changes to transition probabilities. These analyses suggest that neural mechanisms that regulate syllable sequencing could similarly control syllable timing but also highlight mechanisms that can independently regulate syllable sequencing and timing.

The Effects of Electrical and Optical Stimulation of Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons on Rat 50-kHz Ultrasonic Vocalizations	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						phasic dopamine; ultrasonic vocalizations; nucleus accumbens; midbrain dopaminergic neurons; optogenetics; fast-scan cyclic voltammetry	INTRACRANIAL SELF-STIMULATION; SCAN CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; AMPHETAMINE EXPOSURE; MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE; WISTAR RATS; ADULT RATS; RELEASE	Rationale: Adult rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) at around 50-kHz; these commonly occur in contexts that putatively engender positive affect. While several reports indicate that dopaminergic (DAergic) transmission plays a role in the emission of 50 kHz calls, the pharmacological evidence is mixed. Different modes of dopamine (DA) release (i.e., tonic and phasic) could potentially explain this discrepancy. Objective: To investigate the potential role of phasic DA release in 50-kHz call emission. Methods: In Experiment 1, USVs were recorded in adult male rats following unexpected electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). In parallel, phasic DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) was recorded using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. In Experiment 2, USVs were recorded following response-contingent or non-contingent optogenetic stimulation of midbrain DAergic neurons. Four 20-s schedules of optogenetic stimulation were used: fixed interval, fixed time, variable interval, and variable-time. Results: Brief electrical stimulation of the MFB increased both 50-kHz call rate and phasic DA release in the NAcc. During optogenetic stimulation sessions, rats initially called at a high rate comparable to that observed following reinforcers such as psychostimulants. Although optogenetic stimulation maintained reinforced responding throughout the 2-h session, the call rate declined to near zero within the first 30 min. The trill call subtype predominated following both electrical and optical stimulation. Conclusion: The occurrence of electrically-evoked 50-kHz calls, time-locked to phasic DA (Experiment 1), provides correlational evidence supporting a role for phasic DA in USV production. However, in Experiment 2, the temporal dissociation between calling and optogenetic stimulation of midbrain DAergic neurons suggests that phasic mesolimbic DA release is not sufficient to produce 50-kHz calls. The emission of the trill subtype of 50 kHz calls potentially provides a marker distinguishing positive affect from positive reinforcement.	[Scardochio, Tina; Clarke, Paul B.

Ephrin-A3 promotes and maintains slow muscle fiber identity during postnatal development and reinnervation	JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article							TERMINAL SCHWANN-CELLS; HEAVY-CHAIN ISOFORMS; VERTEBRATE NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES; ORIGINAL SYNAPTIC SITES; NEURAL CREST MIGRATION; MOUSE TRANSGENIC LINES; MOTOR AXON GUIDANCE; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; MAMMALIAN MUSCLE	Each adult mammalian skeletal muscle has a unique complement of fast and slow myofibers, reflecting patterns established during development and reinforced via their innervation by fast and slow motor neurons. Existing data support a model of postnatal "matching" whereby predetermined myofiber type identity promotes pruning of inappropriate motor axons, but no molecular mechanism has yet been identified. We present evidence that fiber type-specific repulsive interactions inhibit innervation of slow myofibers by fast motor axons during both postnatal maturation of the neuromuscular junction and myofiber reinnervation after injury. The repulsive guidance ligand ephrin-A3 is expressed only on slow myofibers, whereas its candidate receptor, EphA8, localizes exclusively to fast motor end-plates. Adult mice lacking ephrin-A3 have dramatically fewer slow myofibers in fast and mixed muscles, and misexpression of ephrin-A3 on fast myofibers followed by denervation/reinnervation promotes their respecification to a slow phenotype. We therefore conclude that Eph/ephrin interactions guide the fiber type specificity of neuromuscular interactions during development and adult life.

Indeed, the hesitant tone of a "yes'' may be more telling than its affirmative lexical meaning [1]. The human brain contains dorsal and ventral processing streams in the left hemisphere that underlie core linguistic abilities such as phonology, syntax, and semantics [2-4]. Whether or not prosody-a reportedly right-hemispheric faculty [5, 6]-involves analogous processing streams is a matter of debate. Functional connectivity studies on prosody leave no doubt about the existence of such streams [7, 8], but opinions diverge on whether information travels along dorsal [9] or ventral [10, 11] pathways. Here we show, with a novel paradigm using audio morphing combined with multimodal neuroimaging and brain stimulation, that prosody perception takes dual routes along dorsal and ventral pathways in the right hemisphere. In experiment 1, categorization of speech stimuli that gradually varied in their prosodic pitch contour (between statement and question) involved (1) an auditory ventral pathway along the superior temporal lobe and (2) auditory-motor dorsal pathways connecting posterior temporal and inferior frontal/premotor areas. In experiment 2, inhibitory stimulation of right premotor cortex as a key node of the dorsal stream decreased participants' performance in prosody categorization, arguing for a motor involvement in prosody perception. These data draw a dual-stream picture of prosodic processing that parallels the established left-hemispheric multistream architecture of language, but with relative rightward asymmetry.

Early Growth Response 1 (Egr-1) Regulates N-Methyl-D-aspartate Receptor (NMDAR)-dependent Transcription of PSD-95 and alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole Propionic Acid Receptor (AMPAR) Trafficking in Hippocampal Primary Neurons	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SYNAPTIC VESICLE ENDOCYTOSIS; POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY 95; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; EXCITATORY SYNAPSES; GENE-EXPRESSION; MAMMALIAN BRAIN; PLASTICITY; PHOSPHORYLATION; MECHANISMS	The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) controls synaptic plasticity and memory function and is one of the major inducers of transcription factor Egr-1 in the hippocampus. However, how Egr-1 mediates the NMDAR signal in neurons has remained unclear. Here, we show that the hippocampus of mice lacking Egr-1 displays electrophysiology properties and ultrastructure that are similar to mice overexpressing PSD-95, a major scaffolding protein of postsynaptic density involved in synapse formation, synaptic plasticity, and synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which mediate the vast majority of excitatory transmission in the CNS. We demonstrate that Egr-1 is a transcription repressor of the PSD-95 gene and is recruited to the PSD-95 promoter in response to NMDAR activation. Knockdown of Egr-1 in rat hippocampal primary neurons blocks NMDAR-induced PSD-95 down-regulation and AMPAR endocytosis. Likewise, overexpression of Egr-1 in rat hippocampal primary neurons causes reduction in PSD-95 protein level and promotes AMPAR endocytosis. Our data indicate that Egr-1 is involved in NMDAR-mediated PSD-95 down-regulation and AMPAR endocytosis, a process important in the expression of long term depression.

While axonal responses to individual guidance cues have been extensively studied, less is known about responses to combination of signals and underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we studied the convergence of signals directing trajectory selection of spinal motor axons entering the limb. We first demonstrate that Netrin-1 attracts and repels distinct motor axon populations, according to their expression of Netrin receptors. Quantitative in vitro assays demonstrate that motor axons synergistically integrate both attractive or repulsive Netrin-1 signals together with repulsive ephrin signals. Our investigations of the mechanism of ephrin-B2 and Netrin-1 integration demonstrate that the Netrin receptor Unc5c and the ephrin receptor EphB2 can form a complex in a ligand-dependent manner and that Netrin ephrin synergistic growth cones responses involve the potentiation of Src family kinase signaling, a common effector of both pathways.

In this study, we determined the importance of possible participating professionals and respective roles and responsibilities within the intervention. Methods Using a modified Delphi methodology, recommended professionals and their associated roles and responsibilities were generated from a systematic scoping review of relevant scholarly and grey literatures. These items were reviewed, new items added for review, and rated/re-rated for their importance to the intervention on a 5-point Likert scale by an expert panel during a one day in-person meeting. Items that did not achieve consensus were subsequently re-rated in an online survey. Analysis Those items that achieved a mean Likert rating of 4+ (rated important to very important), and an interquartile range<1 in the first or second round, and/or for which 80% of ratings were 4+ in the second round were retained for the model elder abuse intervention. Results Twenty-two of 31 recommended professionals and 192 of 229 recommended roles and responsibilities rated were retained for our model elder abuse intervention. Retained professionals were: public guardian and trustee (mean rating = 4.88), geriatrician (4.87), police officer (4.87), GEM (geriatric emergency management) nurse (4.80), GEM social worker (4.78), community health worker (4.76), social worker/counsellor (4.74), family physician in community (4.71), paramedic (4.65), financial worker (4.59), lawyer (4.59), pharmacist (4.59), emergency physician (4.57), geriatric psychiatrist (4.33), occupational therapist (4.29), family physician in hospital (4.28), Crown prosecutor (4.24), neuropsychologist (4.24), bioethicist (4.18), caregiver advocate (4.18), victim support worker (4.18), and respite care worker (4.12). Conclusion A large and diverse group of multidisciplinary, intersectoral collaborators was deemed necessary to address the complex needs of abused older adults, each having important roles and responsibilities to fulfill within a model comprehensive elder abuse intervention.

Unlike the baseline HHM, its parametric extension exhibits a richer multitude of dynamic regimes, such as multiple fixed points (FP's), bi- and multistability (coexistence of FP's and/or periodic orbits). Such diversity correlates with a number of functional properties of excitable neural tissue, such as the capacity or not to evoke an action potential (AP) from the resting state, by applying a minimal absolute rheobase current amplitude. The utility of the HHM rooted in the giant squid for the descriptions of the mammalian nervous system is of topical interest. We conclude that the model's fundamental principles are still valid (up to using appropriate parameter values) for warmer-blooded species, without a pressing need for a substantial revision of the mathematical formulation. We demonstrate clearly that the continuous variation of the Delta V-1/2 parameter comes close to being equivalent with recent HHM 'optimizations'. The neural dynamics phenomena described here are nontrivial. The model family analyzed in this work contains the classical HHM as a special case. The validity and applicability of the HHM to mammalian neurons can be achieved by picking the appropriate Delta V-1/2 parameter in a significantly broad range of values. For such large variations, in contrast to the classical HHM, the h and n gates' dynamics may be uncoupled - i.e. the n gates may no longer be considered in mere linear correspondence to the h gates. Delta V-1/2 variation leads to a multitude of dynamic regimes-e.g models with either 1 fixed point (FP) or with 3 FP's. These may also coexist with stable and/or unstable periodic orbits. Hence, depending on the initial conditions, the system may behave as either purely excitable or as an oscillator. Delta V-1/2 variation leads to significant changes in the metabolic efficiency of an action potential (AP). Lower Delta V-1/2 values yield a larger range of AP response frequencies, and hence provide for more flexible neural coding. Such lower values also contribute to faster AP conduction velocities along neural fibers of otherwise comparable-diameter. The 3 FP case brings about an absolute rheobase current. In comparison in the classical HHM the rheobase current is only relative - i.e. excitability is lost after a finite amount of elapsed stimulation time. Lower Delta V-1/2 values translate in lower threshold currents from the resting state.

The present work applies the Typical Dreams Questionnaire (TDQ) to assess several aspects of the content and recall of dreams and nightmares among large cohorts of RBD patients and matched controls. Sixty-eight polysomnographically diagnosed RBD patients (49 men; 63.7 +/- 10.9 y.o.) and 44 healthy controls (28 men; 62.0 +/- 12.2 y.o.) completed the 56-item TDQ and a night of polysomnography. Phasic EMG% in REM sleep and tonic REM sleep% were both assessed. Patients reported remembering nightmares in a typical month almost 5 times more often (3.96) than did controls (0.68) and also recalling more dreams in a month (2.3) than did controls (1.6). More RBD patients reported clinically significant nightmare frequencies than did controls and female RBD patients reported higher dream theme diversity scores than either female controls or male patients. Group main effects for TDQ theme factors pinpointed that RBD patients dreamed more of Disasters, Snakes-Insects, Paralysis-Presence, and Beasts. Patients with the highest levels of tonic EMG% during REM sleep reported remembering fewer dreams (r - -0.377, p < .01), whereas controls with the highest levels of phasic events reported recalling more dreams (r =.491, p <.01). The typical content of patients' dreams reflects threats posed by a variety of external agents, with some differences for men and women patients. RBD patients' most frequently reported themes could reflect a lack of perceived control within the dream and could mirror their well-documented day-time passivity and lack of aggressiveness.

The evidence that an urban-dwelling lifestyle may be detrimental to the cardiometabolic health of Africans motivated the design of the Sympathetic activity and Ambulatory Blood Pressure in African Prospective cohort study. We aimed to determine neural mechanistic pathways involved in emotional distress and vascular remodelling. The baseline sample included 409 teachers representing a bi-ethnic sex cohort from South Africa. The study was conducted in 2008-09 and repeated after 3-year follow-up in 2011-12, with an 87.8% successful follow-up rate. Seasonal changes were avoided and extensive clinical assessments were performed in a well-controlled setting. Data collection included sociodemographics, lifestyle habits, psychosocial battery and genetic analysis, mental stress responses mimicking daily life stress (blood pressure and haemostatic, cardiometabolic, endothelial and stress hormones). Target organ damage was assessed in the brain, heart, kidney, blood vessels and retina. A unique highly phenotyped cohort is presented that can address the role of a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system and neural response pathways contributing to the burden of cardiometabolic diseases in Africans.

Care4Rare Canada Consortium	RTTN Mutations Cause Primary Microcephaly and Primordial Dwarfism in Humans	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							CONSANGUINEOUS FAMILIES; CILIA; IDENTIFICATION; DISORDERS; ROTATIN; PROTEIN; BRAIN; FLUID; FLOW	Primary microcephaly is a developmental brain anomaly that results from defective proliferation of neuroprogenitors in the germinal periventricular zone. More than a dozen genes are known to be mutated in autosomal-recessive primary microcephaly in isolation or in association with a more generalized growth deficiency (microcephalic primordial dwarfism), but the genetic heterogeneity is probably more extensive. In a research protocol involving autozygome mapping and exome sequencing, we recruited a multiplex consanguineous family who is affected by severe microcephalic primordial dwarfism and tested negative on clinical exome sequencing. Two candidate autozygous intervals were identified, and the second round of exome sequencing revealed a single intronic variant therein (c.2885+8A>G[p.Ser963*] in RTTN exon 23). RT-PCR confirmed that this change creates a cryptic splice donor and thus causes retention of the intervening 7 bp of the intron and leads to premature truncation. On the basis of this finding, we reanalyzed the exome file of a second consanguineous family affected by a similar phenotype and identified another homozygous change in RTTN as the likely causal mutation. Combined linkage analysis of the two families confirmed that RTTN maps to the only significant linkage peak. Finally, through international collaboration, a Canadian multiplex family affected by microcephalic primordial dwarfism and biallelic mutation of RTTN was identified. Our results expand the phenotype of RTTN-related disorders, hitherto limited to polymicrogyria, to include microcephalic primordial dwarfism with a complex brain phenotype involving simplified gyration.

This is in part due to the repetitive occlusions of the umbilical cord (UCO) induced by uterine contractions. Whereas fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is widely used clinically, it fails to detect fetal acidemia. Hence, new approaches are needed for early detection of fetal acidemia during labor. We built a mathematical model of the UCO effects on FHR, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), oxygenation and metabolism. Mimicking fetal experiments, our in silico model reproduces salient features of experimentally observed fetal cardiovascular and metabolic behavior including FHR overshoot, gradual MABP decrease and mixed metabolic and respiratory acidemia during UCO. Combined with statistical analysis, our model provides valuable insight into the labor-like fetal distress and guidance for refining FHR monitoring algorithms to improve detection of fetal acidemia and cardiovascular decompensation.

This article introduces a technique for recording somatosensory event-related potentials (ERP) that uses a novel mechanical stimulation method involving skin deformation using a robotic device. Controlled deformation of the facial skin is used to modulate kinesthetic inputs through excitation of cutaneous mechanoreceptors. By combining somatosensory stimulation with electroencephalographic recording, somatosensory evoked responses can be successfully measured at the level of the cortex. Somatosensory stimulation can be combined with the stimulation of other sensory modalities to assess multisensory interactions. For speech, orofacial stimulation is combined with speech sound stimulation to assess the contribution of multi-sensory processing including the effects of timing differences. The ability to precisely control orofacial somatosensory stimulation during speech perception and speech production with ERP recording is an important tool that provides new insight into the neural organization and neural representations for speech.

Among the mechanisms that are involved in the control of embryo or adult NSCs, the Notch signalling plays a major role. In embryo, the pathway participates in the maintenance of NSCs during all steps of development of the central nervous system which starts with the production of neurons also called neurogenesis and continues with gliogenesis giving rise to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. During the postnatal and adult period, Notch signalling is still present in the major neurogenic areas, the sub-ventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. In these regions, Notch maintains NSC quiescence, contributes to the heterogeneity of these cells and displays pleiotropic effects during the regeneration process occurring after a lesion.

Unilateral spatial neglect has been shown to strongly affect motor performance in functional activities, including non-affected upper extremity (UE) movements. To date, our understanding of the effects of USN on goal-directed UE movements is limited and comparing performance of individuals post-stroke with and without USN is required. Objective: To determine, in individuals with stroke, how does the presence of USN, in comparison to the absence of USN, impacts different types of goal-directed movements of the non-affected UE. Methods: The present review approach consisted of a comprehensive literature search, an assessment of the quality of the selected studies and qualitative data analysis. Results: A total of 20 studies of moderate to high quality were selected. The USN-specific impairments were found in tasks that required a perceptual, memory-guided or delayed actions, and fewer impairments were found in tasks that required an immediate action to a predefined target. Conclusion: The results indicate that USN contributes to deficits observed in action execution with the non-effected UE that requires greater perceptual demands.

VOR trough levels were obtained on day 5, 14, 28, and 42 (or at completion of drug; +/- 3 days). Real-time dose adjustments were made to maintain a range between 1-5 mu g/mL on the TDM-arm, while levels were assessed retrospectively in the standard-arm. Patient questionnaires were administered to assess subjective AEs. Results. The study was discontinued prematurely, after 29 patients were enrolled. Seventeen (58.6%) patients experienced 38 AEs: visual changes (22/38, 57.9%), neurological symptoms (13/38, 34.2%), and liver abnormalities (3/38, 7.9%). VOR was discontinued in 7 (25%) patients because of an AE (4 standard-arm, 3 TDM- arm). VOR levels were frequently out of range in the standard-arm (8 tests >5 mu g/mL; 9 tests <1 mu g/mL). Three dose changes occurred in the TDM- arm for VOR levels <1 mu g/mL. Levels decreased over time in the standard-arm, with mean VOR levels lower at end of therapy compared to TDM (1.3 vs. 4.6 mu g/mL, P = 0.008). Conclusions. VOR TDM has become widespread clinical practice, based on known variability in drug levels, which impaired accrual in this study. Although comparative conclusions are limited, observations of variability and waning levels over time support TDM.	[Neofytos, D.; Ostrander, D.; Shoham, S.; Clarke, W.; Brass, L.; Lu, N.; Marr, K.

The selectivity of responses to red-green colour and achromatic contrast in the human visual cortex: an fMRI adaptation study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hMT; L/M cone opponent; V1; V4; VO	CHROMATIC MECHANISMS; STRIATE CORTEX; OBJECT SHAPE; ORIENTATION; MACAQUE; SIGNALS; AREAS; FORM; V1; SENSITIVITY	There is controversy as to how responses to colour in the human brain are organized within the visual pathways. A key issue is whether there are modular pathways that respond selectively to colour or whether there are common neural substrates for both colour and achromatic (Ach) contrast. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation to investigate the responses of early and extrastriate visual areas to colour and Ach contrast. High-contrast red-green (RG) and Ach sinewave rings (0.5 cycles/degree, 2 Hz) were used as both adapting stimuli and test stimuli in a block design. We found robust adaptation to RG or Ach contrast in all visual areas. Cross-adaptation between RG and Ach contrast occurred in all areas indicating the presence of integrated, colour and Ach responses. Notably, we revealed contrasting trends for the two test stimuli. For the RG test, unselective processing (robust adaptation to both RG and Ach contrast) was most evident in the early visual areas (V1 and V2), but selective responses, revealed as greater adaptation between the same stimuli than cross-adaptation between different stimuli, emerged in the ventral cortex, in V4 and VO in particular. For the Ach test, unselective responses were again most evident in early visual areas but Ach selectivity emerged in the dorsal cortex (V3a and hMT+). Our findings support a strong presence of integrated mechanisms for colour and Ach contrast across the visual hierarchy, with a progression towards selective processing in extrastriate visual areas.

Ovarian steroids alter dopamine receptor populations in the medial preoptic area of female rats: implications for sexual motivation, desire, and behaviour	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autoradiography; dopamine receptors; medial preoptic area; ovarian hormones; western blot	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; TREATMENT INCREASES; ESTROGEN-TREATMENT; D2 RECEPTORS; STRIATUM; PROGESTERONE; D1; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Dopamine (DA) transmission in the medial preoptic area (mPOA) plays a critical role in the control of appetitive sexual behaviour in the female rat. We have shown previously that a DA D1 receptor (D1R)-mediated excitatory state appears to occur in females primed with estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P), whereas a DA D2 receptor (D2R)-mediated inhibitory state appears to occur in females primed only with EB. The present experiment employed three techniques to better understand what changes occur to DA receptors (DARs) in the mPOA under different hormonal profiles. Ovariectomized females were randomly assigned to one of three steroid treatment groups: EB + P (10 and 500 mu g, respectively), EB + Oil, or the control (Oil + Oil), with hormone injections administered at 48 and 4 h prior to euthanizing. First, the number of neurons in the mPOA that contained D1R or D2R was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Second, the mPOA and two control areas (the prelimbic cortex and caudate putamen) were analysed for DAR protein levels using western blot, and DAR functional binding levels using autoradiography. Ovarian steroid hormones affected the two DAR subtypes in opposite ways in the mPOA. All three techniques supported previous behavioural findings that females primed with EB have a lower D1R : D2R ratio, and thus a D2R-mediated system, and females primed with EB + P have a higher D1R : D2R ratio, and thus a D1R-mediated system. This provides strong evidence for a DA-driven pathway of female sexual motivation, desire, and behaviour that is modified by different hormone priming regimens.	[Graham, M.

There is consistent support for a functional specialization within the MTL according to these relational processes, much of which comes from recognition memory experiments. In this study, we compared brain activation patterns associated with retrieving within-item relations (i.e., associating conceptual and sensory-perceptual object features) and item-context relations (i.e., spatial relations among objects) with respect to naturalistic autobiographical retrieval. We developed a novel paradigm that cued participants to retrieve information about past autobiographical events, non-episodic within-item relations, and non-episodic item-context relations with the perceptuomotor aspects of retrieval equated across these conditions. We used multivariate analysis techniques to extract common and distinct patterns of activity among these conditions within the MTL and across the whole brain, both in terms of spatial and temporal patterns of activity. The anterior MTL (perirhinal cortex and anterior hippocampus) was preferentially recruited for generating within-item relations later in retrieval whereas the posterior MTL (posterior parahippocampal cortex and posterior hippocampus) was preferentially recruited for generating item-context relations across the retrieval phase. These findings provide novel evidence for functional specialization within the MTL with respect to naturalistic memory retrieval. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Among the potential biomarkers, neurodegeneration measurements from MRI are considered as good candidates but have so far not been effective at the early stages of the pathology. Our objective is to investigate the efficiency of a new MR-based hippocampal grading score to detect incident dementia in cognitively intact patients. This new score is based on a pattern recognition strategy, providing a grading measure that reflects the similarity of the anatomical patterns of the subject under study with dataset composed of healthy subjects and patients with AD. Hippocampal grading was evaluated on subjects from the Three-City cohort, with a followup period of 12 years. Experiments demonstrate that hippocampal grading yields prediction accuracy up to 72.5% (P<0.0001) 7 years before conversion to AD, better than both hippocampal volume (58.1%, P=0.04) and MMSE score (56.9%, P=0.08). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) supports the efficiency of imaging biomarkers with a gain of 8.4 percentage points for hippocampal grade (73.0%) over hippocampal volume (64.6%). Adaptation of the proposed framework to clinical score estimation is also presented. Compared with previous studies investigating new biomarkers for AD prediction over much shorter periods, the very long followup of the Three-City cohort demonstrates the important clinical potential of the proposed imaging biomarker. The high accuracy obtained with this new imaging biomarker paves the way for computer-based prognostic aides to help the clinician identify cognitively intact subjects that are at high risk to develop AD.

The endocannabinoids (eCBs) and their receptors are expressed in the cortex of developing animals where they act as a neuromodulating system during critical stages of brain development such as cell proliferation and migration, and axon guidance. Little is known on the impact of the cannabinoid system on cortical map formation and receptive field properties of cortical sensory neurons. The present study evaluates in vivo the functional organization of the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice lacking cannabinoid CB1R receptor (cnr1(-/-)). METHODS. Using optical imaging of intrinsic signals, azimuth, and elevation maps of cnr1(-/-) mice were compared with their wild-type littermates (cnr1(+/+)). RESULTS. Topographic maps were affected in mutant mice as they exhibited narrower visual field and changes in the shape of V1. CB1R exerted its action in an axis dependent manner as all changes were observed in the azimuth axis. Spatial frequency and contrast sensitivity were also compared between the two groups. Both properties were affected by the chronic lacking of CB1R as mutant mice exhibited a significantly lower contrast sensitivity as well as lower spatial frequency selectivity. CONCLUSIONS. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for CB1R in cortical map formation. Our results also clearly demonstrate the impact of CB1R in the development of visual properties of primary visual cortex neurons. Because psychoactive effects of cannabis consumption on visual experience are mediated mainly through CB1R, our results could possibly explain neuronal mechanisms involved in those perceptual changes.

Choroideremia Is a Systemic Disease With Lymphocyte Crystals and Plasma Lipid and RBC Membrane Abnormalities	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						retinal degeneration; retinal tubulations; lymphocyte crystals; fatty acid metabolism; plasmalogens; choroideremia; Bietti's crystalline dystrophy	GENE; MUTATIONS; DYSTROPHY	PURPOSE. Photoreceptor neuronal degenerations are common, incurable causes of human blindness affecting 1 in 2000 patients worldwide. Only half of all patients are associated with known mutations in over 250 disease genes, prompting our research program to identify the remaining new genes. Most retinal degenerations are restricted to the retina, but photoreceptor degenerations can also be found in a wide variety of systemic diseases. We identified an X-linked family from Sri Lanka with a severe choroidal degeneration and postulated a new disease entity. Because of phenotypic overlaps with Bietti's crystalline dystrophy, which was recently found to have systemic features, we hypothesized that a systemic disease may be present in this new disease as well. METHODS. For phenotyping, we performed detailed eye exams with in vivo retinal imaging by optical coherence tomography. For genotyping, we performed whole exome sequencing, followed by Sanger sequencing confirmations and cosegregation. Systemic investigations included electron microscopy studies of peripheral blood cells in patients and in normal controls and detailed fatty acid profiles (both plasma and red blood cell [RBC] membranes). Fatty acid levels were compared to normal controls, and only values two standard deviations above or below normal controls were further evaluated. RESULTS. The family segregated a REP1 mutation, suggesting choroideremia (CHM). We then found crystals in peripheral blood lymphocytes and discovered significant plasma fatty acid abnormalities and RBC membrane abnormalities (i.e., elevated plasmalogens). To replicate our discoveries, we expanded the cohort to nine CHM patients, genotyped them for REP1 mutations, and found the same abnormalities (crystals and fatty acid abnormalities) in all patients. CONCLUSIONS. Previously, CHM was thought to be restricted to the retina. We show, to our knowledge for the first time, that CHM is a systemic condition with prominent crystals in lymphocytes and significant fatty acid abnormalities.

TADs have internal substructures that are often cell type specific, but their higher-order organization remains elusive. Here, we investigate TAD higher-order interactions with Hi-C through neuronal differentiation and show that they form a hierarchy of domains-within-domains (metaTADs) extending across genomic scales up to the range of entire chromosomes. We find that TAD interactions are well captured by tree-like, hierarchical structures irrespective of cell type. metaTAD tree structures correlate with genetic, epigenomic and expression features, and structural tree rearrangements during differentiation are linked to transcriptional state changes.

The sequential events leading to muscle fibre damage remains largely unknown. Methods and results: We investigated the expression and the cellular localization of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-associated proteins (RPAPs) in muscle biopsies from patients with genetically proven and sporadic MFMs. Our data demonstrated that RPAP2, and to a lesser extent GPN1/RPAP4, are accumulated focally in the cytoplasm of MFM muscle fibres in which they co-localize with POLR2A/RPB1, the largest subunit of RNAPII, and correspond to alpha B-cystallin deposits in distribution and staining intensity. No abnormal staining for RPAP2 has been observed in muscle of patients with central cores, minicores and neurogenic target fibres. Conclusions: Together, these findings could provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of MFMs and suggest that RPAP2 immunostaining can be a useful diagnostic tool to depict protein aggregates in MFMs.	[Guglielmi, Valeria; Marini, Matteo; Tomelleri, Giuliano; Vattemi, Gaetano] Univ Verona, Sect Clin Neurol, Dept Neurol & Movement Sci, I-37134 Verona, Italy; [Masson, Emilie Fiola; Forget, Diane; Coulombe, Benoit] IRCM, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Malatesta, Manuela] Univ Verona, Sect Anat & Histol, Dept Neurol & Movement Sci, I-37134 Verona, Italy	Vattemi, G (reprint author), Univ Verona, Sect Clin Neurol, Dept Neurol & Movement Sci, Ple LA Scuro 10, I-37134 Verona, Italy.	gaetano.vattemi@univr.it						29	1	1	1	1	WILEY-BLACKWELL	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0309-0167	1365-2559		HISTOPATHOLOGY	Histopathology	DEC	2015	67	6					859	865		10.1111/his.12715		7	Cell Biology; Pathology	Cell Biology; Pathology	DA5CT	WOS:000367820500011	25891782	No			2017-07-26

We investigated whether maintenance of neural templates from early language experience influences subsequent language processing. Using fMRI, we scanned the following three groups performing a French phonological working memory (PWM) task: (1) monolingual French children; (2) children adopted from China before age 3 who discontinued Chinese and spoke only French; (3) Chinese-speaking children who learned French as a second language but maintained Chinese. Although all groups perform this task equally well, brain activation differs. French monolinguals activate typical PWM brain regions, while both Chinese-exposed groups also activate regions implicated in cognitive control, even the adoptees who were monolingual French speakers at testing. Early exposure to a language, and/or delayed exposure to a subsequent language, continues to influence the neural processing of subsequently learned language sounds years later even in highly proficient, early-exposed users.

Their etiology is complex including environmental and genetic factors. Defects in the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway have been strongly associated with NTDs in animal models and human cohorts. Protein tyrosine kinase 7 (Ptk7) was shown to cause a very severe form of NTDs called craniorachischisis in a mouse model and genetically interacts with a core PCP member Vangl2 where double heterozygotes suffer from spina bifida. In this study, we examined the role of PTK7 in human NTDs to determine whether variants at this gene predispose to these defects. MethodsWe sequenced the coding region and the exon-intron junctions of PTK7 in a cohort of 473 patients affected with various forms of open and closed NTDs. Novel and rare variants(<1%) were genotyped in a cohort of 473 individuals. Their pathogenic effect was predicted in silico and functionally in an overexpression assay in a well-established zebrafish model. ResultsWe identified in our cohort 6 rare variants, 3 of which were absent in public databases. One variant, p.Gly348Ser, acted as a hypermorph when overexpressed in the zebrafish model. ConclusionWe detected potentially pathogenic PTK7 variants in 1.1% of our NTD cohort. Our findings implicate PTK7 as a risk factor for NTDs and provide additional evidence for a pathogenic role of PCP signaling in these malformations.

Maternal folate deficiency may also modify the risk associated with these disorders. We recently established a mouse model with a mild deficiency of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity in MTHFD1 (Mthfd1S(+/-) mice) to investigate disorders associated with SNPs in this gene. The effect of synthetase deficiency on embryonic heart development has not yet been examined. MethodsFemale Mthfd1S(+/+) and (+/-) mice were placed on control and folate-deficient diets for 6 weeks before mating to Mthfd1S(+/-) males. Embryos and placentae were collected at embryonic day 14.5. Embryos were evaluated for congenital heart defects by histological examination. ResultsEmbryonic Mthfd1S(+/-) genotype was associated with an increased incidence of heart defects, primarily ventricular septal defects. Other markers of embryonic development (crown-rump length, embryonic weight, embryonic delay, placental weight, and thickness of the ventricular myocardium) were not affected by embryonic genotype. Maternal genotype and diet did not have a significant effect on these outcomes. ConclusionDeficiency of the MTHFD1 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity in embryos is associated with increased incidence of congenital heart defects.

The vagus nerve projects to several brainstem autonomic structures. As pupillary measures are an easy and non-invasive method to evaluate autonomic functioning, we used resting diameter and light reflex measures to investigate the influence of VNS on the human central autonomic nervous system. Method: We studied 21 patients (7 with major depression, 14 with epilepsy) treated with chronic VNS (30s ON, 5 min OFF stimulation trains). Resting pupil size and light reflex measures were compared in consecutive intervals with (ON) and without stimulation (OFF). Results: Compared to the OFF condition, the ON condition was associated with a significant increase in resting pupil diameter, but did not affect light reflex measures. There was no group difference between the two populations of patients (depression and epilepsy) on any of the pupil measures. Conclusion: VNS at clinically significant levels increases resting pupil diameter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded from 18 healthy volunteers during performance in the VTOT. Participants were required to detect random repetitions of three-dimensional visual stimuli (OLD) and to refrain from responding to non-repeated stimuli (NEW). Differences in ERP between the NEW and OLD conditions were tested for statistical significance using assumption-free non-parametric analyses. Further, a correlation between ERP and behavioral measures was sought. Significant OLD-NEW effects were found for four ERP components showing distinct spatio-temporal characteristics: a posterior positive component appearing at 100 ms (P100), a left-lateralized negative component pealcing at approximate to 250 ms (N250), a frontal negative component at approximate to 300-450 ms (FN400), and a right late frontal negativity (rLFN) at approximate to 500-720 ms. Moreover, individual differences in the OLD-NEW effect computed for the rLFN positively correlated with repeated stimulus recognition efficiency. However, there were no late left parietal P600 old/new effects. These findings suggest that the P100 component might reflect early visual perception processes taking place during performance in the task, whereas the N250 and FN400 components could be linked to stimulus-dependent access to visual memory representations and familiarity-related processes, respectively. In contrast, we propose that the rLFN component could be associated with higher-level cognitive functions, such as attention and monitoring processes. Altogether, our results suggest that the ERP version of the VTOT could play a role in the electrophysiological assessment of visuo-spatial memory and related sub-processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Racine, E				Racine, Eric			Revisiting the Persisting Tension Between Expert and Lay Views About Brain Death and Death Determination: A Proposal Inspired by Pragmatism	JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY			English	Article						Brain death; Death determination; Ethics; Pragmatism; Epistemology	DONOR RULE; WHOLE; CONTROVERSIES; DEFINITION; DIAGNOSIS; CRITERIA; SCIENCE; ETHICS; CARE	Brain death or determination of death based on the neurological criterion has been an enduring source of controversy in academic and clinical circles. The controversy chiefly concerns how death is defined, and it also bears on the justification of the proposed criteria for death determination and their interpretation. Part of the controversy on brain death and death determination stems from disputed crucial medical facts, but in this paper I formulate another hypothesis about the nature of ongoing controversies. At stake is a misunderstood relationship between, on the one hand, the nature of our lay (or our "manifest image") views about death and, on the other hand, the nature of scientific insights (and related conceptual refinements) into death and its determination (the "scientific image"). The misunderstanding of this relationship has partly anchored the controversy and continues to fuel it. Based on a perspective inspired by pragmatism, which stresses the positive contribution of science to ethical and policy debates but also challenges different forms of scientism in science and philosophy found in foundationalist interpretations, I scrutinize three different stances regarding the relationship between lay and scientific perspectives about the definition of death: (1) foundational lay views, (2) foundational expert views, and (3) co-evolving views. I argue that only the latter is sustainable given recent challenges to foundationalist interpretations.

J	Valverde, R				Valverde, Raul			Neurotechnology as a Tool for Inducing and Measuring Altered States of Consciousness in Transpersonal Psychotherapy	NEUROQUANTOLOGY			English	Article						altered states of consciousness; neurotechnology; biofeedback; transpersonal therapy	NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES; HYPOTHESIS; PSYCHOLOGY; COMPLEX; MYTH	Transpersonal psycho therapy is based on transpersonal psychology and considers that the psyche is multidimensional and that there are several "levels of consciousness" and each has different characteristics and is governed by different laws. Transpersonal psychology is the study of human nature and proceeds on the assumption that human beings possess potentials that exceed the limits of their ego and integrate the spiritual experience within a broader understanding of the human psyche and consciousness. Altered states of consciousness have been used as psychotherapy in transpersonal psychology for decades. Although there are very well known techniques to induce altered state of consciousness as holotropic breathwork, neurotechnology offers an alternative way not only to induce these states for transpersonal therapy but also to measure the level of a state of consciousness. The objective of this article is to provide a review of the main concepts of neurotechnology and the main technologies that can be used to induce and measure altered state of consciousness for transpersonal psychotherapy.

Borane-protected phosphines are redox-active radioprotective agents for endothelial cells	REDOX BIOLOGY			English	Article						Phosphine-borane complexes; Disulfide reduction; Radiation; Radioprotection; Endothelial cells	RADIATION OPTIC NEUROPATHY; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; NF-KAPPA-B; INTRACELLULAR SUPEROXIDE; CAPILLARY ENDOTHELIUM; CYSTEINE RESIDUES; AXONAL INJURY; THIOL; DAMAGE; DNA	Exposure to radiation can damage endothelial cells in the irradiated area via the production of reactive oxygen species. We synthesized phosphine-borane complexes that reduce disulfide bonds and had previously been shown to interfere with redox-mediated signaling of cell death. We hypothesized that this class of drugs could interfere with the downstream effects of oxidative stress after irradiation and rescue endothelial cells from radiation damage. Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells were plated for clonogenic assay prior to exposure to varying doses of irradiation from a Cs-137 irradiator and treated with various concentrations of bis(3-propionic acid methyl ester)phenylphosphine boranc complex (PB1) at different time points. The clone forming ability of the irradiated cells was assessed seven clays after irradiation. We compared the radioprotective effects of PB1 with the aminothiol radioprotectant WR1065 and known superoxide scavengers. PB1 significantly protected bovine aortic endothelial cells from radiation damage, particularly when treated both before and after radiation. The radioprotection with 1 mu M PB1 corresponded to a dose reduction factor of 1.24. Radioprotection by PB1 was comparable to the aminothiol WR1065, but was significantly less toxic and required much lower concentrations of drug (1 mu M vs. 4 mM, respectively). Superoxide scavengers were not radioprotective in this paradigm, indicating the mechanisms for both loss of clonogenicity and PB1 radioprotection are independent of superoxide signaling. These data demonstrate that PB1 is an effective redox-active radioprotectant for endothelial cells ill vitro, and is radioprotective at a concentration approximately 4 orders of magnitude lower than the aminothiol WR1065 with less toxicity.

Unwanted consequences of the UHI not only include an increase in mean/peak energy demand, but an escalation in the heat-related mortality and disease. Although UHI mitigation strategies are being implemented by cities, they serve as mid to long-term solutions. The implementation of short-term mitigation strategies is paramount for cities to reduce the immediate risks of the heatrelated hazards. Various prognostic tools have been developed to empower urban planners and decision makers in minimizing the related risks. These tools are mainly based on stationary parameters, such as the average surface temperature of a city, and are independent of land-use/land-cover (LULC). Furthermore, the outdoor temperatures are utilized to develop such models. However, heat-related risks occur mostly in indoor spaces, and correlations between indoor and outdoor spaces are rarely considered. In this study, a predictive model for the indoor air temperature of buildings is developed using the artificial neural network (ANN) concept. A four-month measurement campaign was conducted to obtain indoor temperatures of more than 50 buildings located on the island of Montreal. The area is then separated into 11 regions, each containing at least one of the measured buildings. The ANN model is then trained to be sensitive to the neighborhood's characteristics and LULC of each region. The surrounding radial area that influences the building's indoor temperature is first defined within an effective radius, by analyzing areas with radii ranging from 20 m to 500 m in 20 m increments. Hence, the effective radius is found for each region to be within a radial area, where the environment beyond its limit does not significantly impact the building indoor air temperature. This technique trains a single model for the city, encompassing the unique characteristics of the sub-regions that contain buildings under study. An effective radius was established to lie within 320-380 m. Analyzing surrounding radial areas within this range enabled the network to effectively forecast future indoor conditions resulting from UHI effects, producing hourly indoor temperature predictions with an MSE of 0.68. Furthermore, the ability of the developed tool in the city planning is investigated with an additional case study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We have recently shown that activating the central oxytocinergic system prevents emotional impairment and stress-induced reinstatement associated with opioid withdrawal. Here, we investigated whether the oxytocin analogue carbetocin (CBT) is able to reverse morphine-primed reinstatement of conditioned-place preference (CPP) in mice. The mechanism underlining the behavioural effect of CBT was investigated by assessing the involvement of the striatal noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in CBT reversal of priming- and stress-induced reinstatement of opioid CPP. In addition, given recent evidence suggesting the presence of oxytocin receptor (OTR)-mu-opioid receptor (MOPr) interactions in the brain, we further explored these interactions by carrying out OTR autoradiographic binding in brain of mice lacking MOPr. CBT administration prevented priminginduced reinstatement of morphine CPR While an acute effect of CBT in enhancing dopamine turnover was observed following stress- and priming-induced reinstatement, CBT significantly decreased striatal noradrenaline turnover only following priming-induced reinstatement. Moreover, a significant brain region- specific increase in OTR binding was observed in MOPr knockout mice, indicating the presence of a possible OTR-MOPr interaction, which may be involved in the modulation of relapse. These results support the oxytocinergic system as a promising target for the prevention of relapse to opioid use and highlight the differential involvement of monoaminergic systems on the effects of OTR stimulation in preventing stressand priming-induced reinstatement of opioid CPP behaviour.

Fault detection and isolation of gas turbine engines using a bank of neural networks	JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL			English	Article						Dynamic neural networks; Bank of neural networks; Fault detection and isolation; Gas turbine engines	ATTITUDE-CONTROL SUBSYSTEM; DIAGNOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; SATELLITES; MODEL	The main goal of this paper is to design and develop a fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme for aircraft gas turbine engines by using neural networks. Towards this end, first for the fault detection task two types of dynamic neural networks are used and compared to learn the engine dynamics. Specially, the dynamic neural model (DNM) and the time delay neural network (TDNN) are utilized. For both architectures a bank of neural networks is trained separately to capture the dynamic relationships among the engine measurable variables. The results show that certain engine parameters have better detection capabilities as compared to the others. Finally, the fault isolation task is accomplished by using a multilayer perception (MLP) network functioning as a pattern classifier applied to the residual signals that are generated by the two dynamic neural networks used for the purpose of the fault detection task. The simulation results do indeed substantiate and verify that our proposed FDI scheme represents a promising tool for aircraft engine diagnostics and health monitoring. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this study is to investigate whether these impairments can be identified early in life using electrophysiological auditory event-related potentials (AERPs) and mismatch negativity (MMN). Brain responses to speech and non-speech stimuli were assessed in prematurely born children to identify early electrophysiological markers of language and cognitive impairments. Participants were 74 children (41 full-term, 33 preterm) aged 3, 12, and 36 months. Pre-attentional auditory responses (MMN and AERPs) were assessed using an oddball paradigm, with speech and non-speech stimuli presented in counterbalanced order between participants. Language and cognitive development were assessed using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). Results show that preterms as young as 3 months old had delayed MMN response to speech stimuli compared to full-terms. A significant negative correlation was also found between MMN latency to speech sounds and the BSID-III expressive language subscale. However, no significant differences between full-terms and preterms were found for the MMN to non-speech stimuli, suggesting preserved pre-attentional auditory discrimination abilities in these children. Identification of early electrophysiological markers for delayed language development could facilitate timely interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy induces sensorimotor and specific electrocortical changes in chronic tic and Tourette's disorder	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; Tics; Cognitive-behavioral therapy; Event-related potentials; Lateralized readiness potentials; Sensorimotor remediation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE-DISORDER; STIMULUS-RESPONSE COMPATIBILITY; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; BRAIN POTENTIALS; P300 LATENCY; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; RETEST RELIABILITY; INVENTORY	Background: Tic disorders, such as the Gilles de la burette syndrome and persistent tic disorder, are neurodevelopmental movement disorders involving impaired motor control. Hence, patients show repetitive unwanted muscular contractions in one or more parts of the body. A cognitive-behavioral therapy, with a particular emphasis on the psychophysiology of tic expression and sensorimotor activation, can reduce the frequency and intensity of tics. However, its impact on motor activation and inhibition is not fully understood. Methods: To study the effects of a cognitive-behavioral therapy on electrocortical activation, we recorded the event-related potentials (ERP) and lateralized readiness potentials (LRP), before and after treatment, of 20 patients with tic disorders and 20 healthy control participants (matched on age, sex and intelligence), during a stimulus-response compatibility inhibition task. The cognitive-behavioral therapy included informational, awareness training, relaxation, muscle discrimination, cognitive restructuration and relapse prevention strategies. Results: Our results revealed that prior to treatment; tic patients had delayed stimulus-locked LRP onset latency, larger response-locked LRP peak amplitude, and a frontal overactivation during stimulus inhibition processing. Both stimulus-locked LRP onset latency and response-locked LRP peak amplitude normalized after the cognitive behavioral therapy completion. However, the frontal overactivation related to inhibition remained unchanged following therapy. Conclusions: Our results showed that P300 and reaction times are sensitive to stimulus-response compatibility, but are not related to tic symptoms. Secondly, overactivity of the frontal LPC and impulsivity in TD patients were not affected by treatment. Finally, CBT had normalizing effects on the activation of the pre-motor and motor cortex in TD patients. These results imply specific modifications of motor processes following therapy, while inhibition processes remained unchanged. Given that LRPs are partially generated within the sensorimotor and supplementary motor area, the reported reduction in tic frequency and improvements of LRPs components suggest that CBT induced a physiological change in patients' motor area.

Deletion of Melanin Concentrating Hormone Receptor-1 disrupts overeating in the presence of food cues	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual Meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior	JUL 29-AUG 02, 2014	Seattle, WA			Lateral hypothalamus; Licking microstructure; Binge eating; Obesity; Glucose sensing; Allostasis	FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; CONDITIONED-STIMULUS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; LEARNED CUES; MICE LEADS; SATED RATS; EXPRESSION; MICROSTRUCTURE; OBESITY; SYSTEM	Exposure to environmental cues associated with food can evoke eating behavior in the absence of hunger. This capacity for reward cues to promote feeding behaviors under sated conditions can be examined in the laboratory using cue-potentiated feeding (CPF). The orexigenic neuropeptide Melanin Concentrating Hormone (MCH) is expressed throughout brain circuitry critical for CPF. We examined whether deletion of the MCH receptor, MCH-1R, would in KO mice disrupt overeating in the presence of a Pavlovian CS + associated with sucrose delivery. While both wild-type controls and MO mice showed comparable food magazine approach responses during the CPF test, MCH-1R deletion significantly impaired the ability of the CS + to evoke overeating of sucrose under satiety. Through the use of a refined analysis of meal intake, it was revealed that this disruption to overeating behavior in MO mice reflected a reduction in the capacity for the CS + to initiate and maintain bursts of licking behavior. These findings suggest that overeating during CPF requires intact MCH-1R signaling and may be due to an influence of the CS + on the palatability of food and on regulatory mechanisms of peripheral control. Thus, disruptions to MCH-1R signaling may be a useful pharmacological tool to inhibit this form, of overeating behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

There is increasing evidence that DNA methylation is a mechanism by which environmental factors influence gene transcription and, ultimately, phenotype. However, differentiating the effects of the environment from those of genetics on DNA methylation profiles remains a significant challenge. Monozygotic (MZ) twin study designs are unique in their ability to control for genetic differences because each pair of MZ twins shares essentially the same genetic sequence with the exception of a small number of de novo mutations and copy number variations. Thus, differences within twin pairs in gene expression and phenotype, including behavior, can be attributed in the majority of cases to environmental effects rather than genetic influence. In this article, we review the literature showing how MZ twin designs can be used to study basic epigenetic principles, contributing to understanding the role of early in utero and postnatal environmental factors on the development of psychopathology. We also highlight the importance of initiating longitudinal and experimental studies with MZ twins during pregnancy. This approach is especially important to identify: (1) critical time periods during which the early environment can impact brain and mental health development, and (2) the specific mechanisms through which early environmental effects may be mediated. These studies may inform the optimum timing and design for early preventive interventions aimed at reducing risk for psychopathology.

J	Rath-Wilson, K; Guitton, D				Rath-Wilson, Kate; Guitton, Daniel			Refuting the hypothesis that a unilateral human parietal lesion abolishes saccade corollary discharge	BRAIN			English	Article						corollary discharge; parietal lesion; visuospatial representation; double-step; saccade	FRONTAL EYE FIELD; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; DOUBLE-STEP SACCADES; VISUAL EXTINCTION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MEMORY; CORTEX; BRAIN; SIGNALS; NEGLECT	This paper questions the prominent role that the parietal lobe is thought to play in the processing of corollary discharges for saccadic eye movements. A corollary discharge copies the motor neurons' signal and sends it to brain areas involved in monitoring eye trajectories. The classic double-step saccade task has been used extensively to study these mechanisms: two targets (T1 and T2) are quickly (40-150 ms) flashed sequentially in the periphery. After the extinction of the fixation point, subjects are to make two saccades (S1 and S2), in the dark, to the remembered locations of the targets in the order they appeared. The success of S2 requires a corollary discharge encoding S1's vector. Patients with a parietal lobe lesion, particularly on the right, are impaired at generating an accurate S2 when S1 is directed contralesionally, but not ipsilesionally, thought due to an impaired contralesional corollary discharge. In contrast, we hypothesize that failure on the classic double-step task is due to visual processing and attentional deficits that commonly result from lesions of the parietal lobe and imperfect data analysis methods. Here, we studied parietal patients who fail in the classic double-step task when tested and data analysed according to previously published methods. We then tested our patients on two modified versions of the double-step task, designed to mitigate deficits other than corollary discharge that may have confounded previous investigations. In our 'exogenous' task, T2 was presented prior to T1 and for longer (T2: 800-1200 ms, T1: 350 ms) than in the classic task. S1 went to T1 and S2 to T2, all in the dark. All patients who completed sufficient trials had a corollary discharge for contralesional and ipsilesional S1s (5/5). In our 'endogenous' task, a single target was presented peripherally for 800-1200 ms. After extinction of target and fixation point, patients made first an 'endogenous' S1, of self-determined amplitude either to the left or right, before making S2 to the remembered location of the previously flashed target. To be successful, a corollary discharge of endogenous S1-generated in the dark-was required in the calculation of S2's motor vector. Every parietal patient showed evidence of using corollary discharges for endogenous S1s in the ipsilesional and contralesional directions (6/6). Our results support the hypothesis, based on our previous studies of corollary discharge mechanisms in hemidecorticate patients, and electrophysiological studies by others in monkey, that corollary discharges for left and right saccades are available to each cortical hemisphere.

Few studies have focused on enhanced interoceptive sensitivity in FM. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate spontaneous sensations (SPS) in FM. Design: SPS are those tingling, tickly and other kind of sensations usually perceived on the skin during periods of rest and without any external trigger. Therefore, we have investigated SPS by requiring participants to focus attention on each hand. Methods: Eighteen patients with a diagnosis of FM and 18 matched healthy participants had to direct their gaze toward the hand tested for a period of 10 s. Subsequently, they had to map and report the intensity, the number and the qualitative properties of sensations arising spontaneously. Finally, participants had to fill out questionnaires assessing cognitive and affective status that may influence the interoceptive sensations feedback. Results: Patients with FM perceived SPS as significantly more intense than controls did. Additionally, SPS were perceived by the FM group as occupying an overall larger area on the hand than those reported by controls. Importantly, entering scores of pain and catastrophism as covariates produced a relative effect on the feeling of SPS. Conclusions: The outcome of this study supports the generalized hypervigilance model, suggesting that patients with FM have a perceptual style of amplification of non-aversive interoceptive stimulation, modulated by pain and catastrophizing. This is discussed in relationship to interoceptive awareness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Sensory gating (SG), or repetition suppression, refers to the attenuation of neural activity in response to a second stimulus and is considered to be an automatic process to inhibit redundant sensory inputs. It is controversial whether SG deficits, as tested with an auditory paired-stimulus protocol, accompany normal aging in humans. To reconcile the debates arising from event-related potential studies, we recorded auditory neuromagnetic reactivity in 20 young and 19 elderly adult men and determined the neural activation by using minimum-norm estimate (MNE) source modeling. SG of M100 was calculated by the ratio of the response to the second stimulus over that to the first stimulus. MNE results revealed that fronto-temporo-parietal networks were implicated in the M100 SG. Compared to the younger participants, the elderly showed selectively increased SG ratios in the anterior superior temporal gyrus, anterior middle temporal gyrus, temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting an insufficient age-related gating to repetitive auditory stimulation. These findings also highlight the loss of frontal inhibition of the auditory cortex in normal aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we used an fMRI affective face processing task to compare a large group (n = 70) of 14-year olds with a history of cannabis use to a group (n = 70) of never-using controls matched on numerous characteristics including IQ, SES, alcohol and cigarette use. The task contained short movies displaying angry and neutral faces. Results indicated that cannabis users had greater reactivity in the bilateral amygdalae to angry faces than neutral faces, an effect that was not observed in their abstinent peers. In contrast, activity levels in the cannabis users in cortical areas including the right temporal-parietal junction and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex did not discriminate between the two face conditions, but did differ in controls. Results did not change after excluding subjects with any psychiatric symptomology. Given the high density of cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala, our findings suggest cannabis use in early adolescence is associated with hypersensitivity to signals of threat. Hypersensitivity to negative affect in adolescence may place the subject at-risk for mood disorders in adulthood. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although these brain regions are the main targets of anesthetic action, they are contained in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical feedback loops, involved in naturally occurring and drug-induced psychoses. Therefore, functional integrity of these loops was examined in adolescent and adult rats through D-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. Propofol treatment (25 mg/kg) decreased exon-specific and total BDNF mRNA expression in the frontal cortex and thalamus, in a time-dependent manner. BDNF protein level was increased in the frontal cortex and decreased in the thalamus, which was accompanied by the change of phospho-TrkB expression. Similarly to BDNF, the expression of c-Fos was decreased in the frontal cortex while it was changed only at the protein level in the thalamus. Synaptic plasticity markers changed in a time- and region-specific manner, indicating increased synaptogenesis in the frontal cortex and synapse elimination in the thalamus in P7 rats after the propofol anesthesia exposure. These early molecular changes were followed by time-related, increased motor reaction to D-amphetamine in adolescent, but not in adult rats. Our study revealed that exposure of immature brain to propofol anesthesia during the critical phase of development provoked immediate changes in activity-dependent processes and synaptic adjustment, influencing brain capacity to integrate later developmental events and resulting in temporary altered response to acute psychotropic stimulation during adolescence.

PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE INVENTORY-REVISED IN A TURKISH ANALOGUE SAMPLE	PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article							THOUGHT CONTROL; DISORDER; QUESTIONNAIRE; REPLICATION; STRATEGIES; VALIDATION; EXTENSION; SYMPTOMS; VERSION; OCD	The Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) assesses distress associated with the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study reports on the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the OCI-R as a widely known measure. The sample consisted of 319 Turkish university students (67.1% women; M age = 21.5, SD = 2.0). The questionnaire battery included measures of OCD symptoms, specific cognitions, thought control, and personality characteristics. A target rotation analysis supported the factorial validity of the Turkish OCI-R as indicated by its replicability with the original factor structure (i.e., checking, washing, obsessing, hoarding, ordering, and mental neutralizing). High-scoring OCD symptom groups also significantly differed on the Turkish OCI-R and thus presented preliminary evidence for its criterion validity. Correlational analysis supported convergent and divergent validity of the measure, with significant correlations between the Turkish OCI-R and OCD symptoms, OCD-specific beliefs, two thought control strategies (e.g., worry and punishment), and neuroticism, but not with psychoticism or extraversion. The current findings provide initial evidence of sound psychometric properties for the Turkish OCI-R in a nonclinical sample.

Neuroimaging predictors of functional outcomes in schizophrenia at baseline and 6-month follow-up	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Diffusion tensor imaging; Fractional anisotropy; Arcuate fasciculus; Inferior longitudinal fasciculus; Cortical thickness; Network analysis	WHITE-MATTER ABNORMALITIES; DIFFUSION TENSOR MRI; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENT; FRACTIONAL ANISOTROPY; DEFICIT SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; INTEGRITY; SUBTYPE	Purpose: Studies show that deficit syndrome schizophrenia patients, characterized by primary negative symptoms and poor functional outcome, have impairment in specific neural circuits. We assessed whether these same neural circuits are directly linked to functional outcomes across schizophrenia patients. Methods: T1- and diffusion-weighted MR images were obtained for schizophrenia (n=30) and matched healthy control participants (n=30). Negative symptoms and functional outcome were assessed at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Cortical thickness and tract-wise fractional anisotropy (FA) were compared between groups. To assess relationships of neuroimaging measures with functional outcome, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on tract-wise FA values and components were entered into a multiple regression model for schizophrenia participants. Results: Consistent with the literature, schizophrenia participants showed frontotemporal reductions in cortical thickness and tract-wise FA compared to controls. The top two components from PCA explained 71% of the variance in tract-wise FA values. The second component (associated with inferior longitudinal and arcuate fasciculus FA) was significantly correlated with functional outcome (baseline: beta=0.54, p=0.03; follow-up: beta=0.74, p=0.047); further analysis revealed this effect was mediated by negative symptoms. Post-hoc network analysis revealed increased cortical coupling between right inferior frontal and supramarginal gyri (connected by the arcuate fasciculus) in schizophrenia participants with poorer functional outcome. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that impairment in the same neural circuitry susceptible in deficit syndrome schizophrenia predicts functional outcome in a continuous manner in schizophrenia participants. This relationship was mediated by negative symptom burden. Our findings provide novel evidence for brain-based biomarkers of longitudinal functional outcome in people with schizophrenia.

In these multitarget ligands, the two pharmacophores do not overlap, and this allowed maintaining high NK1R affinity and antagonist potency in compounds 12 and 13. Although the fusion of the two ligands resulted in slightly diminished opioid agonism at the mu- and delta-opioid receptors (MOR and DOR, respectively), as compared to the opioid parent peptide, balanced MOR/DOR activities were obtained. Compared to morphine, compounds 12 and 13 produced more potent antinociceptive effects in both acute (tail-flick) and neuropathic pain models (von Frey and cold plate). Similarly to morphine, analgesic tolerance developed after repetitive administration of these compounds. To our delight, compound 12 did not produce cross-tolerance with morphine and high antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects could be reinstated after chronic administration of each of the two compounds.

We demonstrate that improved sensitivity for wide-field spectroscopic fluorescence imaging is achieved with minimal disruption to the neurosurgical workflow using an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) relative to a state-of-the-art CMOS system. In phantom experiments the EMCCD system can detect at least two orders-of-magnitude lower PpIX. Ex vivo tissue imaging on a rat glioma model demonstrates improved fluorescence contrast compared with neurosurgical fluorescence microscope technology, and the fluorescence detection is confirmed with measurements from a clinically-validated spectroscopic probe. Greater PpIX sensitivity in wide-field fluorescence imaging may improve the residual tumor detection during surgery with consequent impact on survival.

Compressive and traumatic nerve injuries are the two main indications for imaging investigation of nerves with several publications describing the indications, technique and diagnostic capabilities of imaging signs. Investigation of entrapment neuropathies has three main goals, which are to confirm neuronal distress, search for the cause of nerve compression and exclude a differential diagnosis on the entire nerve. For traumatic nerve injuries, imaging, predominantly ultrasound, occasionally provides essential information for management including the type of nerve lesion, its exact site and local extension.

In addition to severe liver dysfunction, some of these individuals also suffered from other comorbidities including cardiomyopathy, neurologic phenotypes and gastrointestinal immune defects. Here we report on a consanguineous Lebanese family with three siblings affected by RALF. Of note, neonatal spontaneous fractures, developmental delay, prominent eyes, generalized hirsutism, gum hypertrophy, and hepatosplenomegaly were also present. Methods: Whole-genome SNP genotyping in all the patients, followed by exome sequencing was performed in one of the affected siblings. Results: A homozygous c.409C > T (p.Arg137Trp) missense mutation in NBAS was identified in all patients. Conclusion: Overall, our findings confirm the involvement of NBAS in the pathogenesis of this condition characterized by severe liver dysfunction and help expand its phenotypical spectrum.

However, these dense reversed-contrast SWI venograms pose new segmentation challenges. We present an automatic method for whole-brain venous blood segmentation in SWI using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The CRF model combines different first and second order potentials. First-order association potentials are modeled as the composite of an appearance potential, a Hessian-based shape potential and a non-linear location potential. Second-order interaction potentials are modeled using an auto-logistic (smoothing) potential and a data-dependent (edge) potential. Minimal post-processing is used for excluding voxels outside the brain parenchyma and visualizing the surface vessels. The CRF model is trained and validated using 30 SWI venograms acquired within a population of deep brain stimulation (DBS) patients (age range years). Results demonstrate robust and consistent segmentation in deep and sub-cortical regions (median kappa = 0.84 and 0.82), as well as in challenging mid-sagittal and surface regions (median kappa = 0.81 and 0.83) regions. Overall, this CRF model produces high-quality segmentation of SWI venous vasculature that finds applications in DBS for minimizing hemorrhagic risks and other surgical and non-surgical applications.

Within a repeated measures design, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was employed to investigate neural responses to threat in PTSD participants (N=7), during the presentation of emotional facial expressions. Scans were separated by 6 weekly reconsolidation impairment treatment sessions, consisting of traumatic memory reactivation under the influence of propranolol. Greater activation before versus after treatment emerged in the thalamus and amygdala during fearful versus neutral face processing. Furthermore, participants showed greater activation after versus before treatment in the right anterior cingulate, during fearful relative to happy face processing. PTSD symptoms significantly improved (d = 1.75), post-treatment. These preliminary results suggest that aberrant emotional responding is modulated by noradrenergic plasticity within the amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuit, a neural substrate for the pharmacological treatment of PTSD.

Inhaled Cannabis for Chronic Neuropathic Pain: A Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Review						Cannabis; chronic pain; neuropathy; painful; polyneuropathy; meta-analysis; meta-analysis of individual patient data; Bayesian analysis; human immunodeficiency virus	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; MEDICAL MARIJUANA; PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; CLINICAL IMPORTANCE; SENSORY NEUROPATHY; RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; BAYESIAN-APPROACH; MECHANISMS; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Chronic neuropathic pain, the most frequent condition affecting the peripheral nervous system, remains underdiagnosed and difficult to treat. Inhaled cannabis may alleviate chronic neuropathic pain. Our objective was to synthesize the evidence on the use of inhaled cannabis for chronic neuropathic pain. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of individual patient data. We registered our protocol with PROSPERO CRD42011001182. We searched in Cochrane Central, PubMed, EMBASE, and AMED. We considered all randomized controlled trials investigating chronic painful neuropathy and comparing inhaled cannabis with placebo. We pooled treatment effects following a hierarchical random-effects Bayesian responder model for the population-averaged subject-specific effect. Our evidence synthesis of individual patient data from 178 participants with 405 observed responses in 5 randomized controlled trials following patients for days to weeks provides evidence that inhaled cannabis results in short-term reductions in chronic neuropathic pain for 1 in every 5 to 6 patients treated (number needed to treat = 5.6 with a Bayesian 95% credible interval ranging between 3.4 and 14). Our inferences were insensitive to model assumptions, priors, and parameter choices. We caution that the small number of studies and participants, the short follow-up, shortcomings in allocation concealment, and considerable attrition limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the review. The Bayes factor is 332, corresponding to a posterior probability of effect of 99.7%. Perspective: This novel Bayesian meta-analysis of individual patient data from 5 randomized trials suggests that inhaled cannabis may provide short-term relief for 1 in 5 to 6 patients with neuropathic pain. Pragmatic trials are needed to evaluate the long-term benefits and risks of this treatment.

The safety of cannabis use for medical purposes has not been systematically evaluated. We conducted a prospective cohort study to describe safety issues among individuals with chronic non-cancer pain. A standardized herbal cannabis product (12.5% tetrahydrocannabinol) was dispensed to eligible individuals for a 1-year period; controls were individuals with chronic pain from the same clinics who were not cannabis users. The primary outcome consisted of serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events. Secondary safety outcomes included pulmonary and neurocognitive function and standard hematology, biochemistry, renal, liver, and endocrine function. Secondary efficacy parameters included pain and other symptoms, mood, and quality of life. Two hundred and fifteen individuals with chronic pain were recruited to the cannabis group (141 current users and 58 ex-users) and 216 controls (chronic pain but no current cannabis use) from 7 clinics across Canada. The median daily cannabis dose was 2.5 g/d. There was no difference in risk of serious adverse events (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 1.08, 95% confidence interval = .57-2.04) between groups. Medical cannabis users were at increased risk of non-serious adverse events (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.41-2.13); most were mild to moderate. There were no differences in secondary safety assessments. Quality-controlled herbal cannabis, when used by patients with experience of cannabis use as part of a monitored treatment program over 1 year, appears to have a reasonable safety profile. Longer-term monitoring for functional outcomes is needed. Study registration: The study was registered with www.controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN19449752). Perspective: This study evaluated the safety of cannabis use by patients with chronic pain over 1 year. The study found that there was a higher rate of adverse events among cannabis users compared with controls but not for serious adverse events at an average dose of 2.5 g herbal cannabis per day.

Here, we compared the antinociceptive effects of enantiomeric configurations of propranolol and bupranolol, two structurally similar nonselective beta-blocking drugs, against mouse models of inflammatory and chronic pain. In addition, we calculated in silico docking and measured the binding properties of propranolol and bupranolol for all 3 beta-ARs. Of the agents examined, S-bupranolol is superior in terms of its antinociceptive effect and exhibited fewer side effects than propranolol or its associated enantiomers. In contrast to propranolol, S-bupranolol exhibited negligible beta-AR intrinsic agonist activity and displayed a full competitive antagonist profile at beta(1)/beta(2)/beta(3)-ARs, producing a unique blockade of beta(3)-AR5. We have shown that S-bupranolol is an effective antinociceptive agent in mice without negative side effects. The distinctive profile of S-bupranolol is most likely mediated by its negligible beta-AR intrinsic agonist activity and unique blockade of beta(3)-AR. These findings suggest that S-bupranolol instead of propranolol may represent a new and effective treatment for a variety of painful conditions. Perspective: The S enantiomer of bupranolol, a beta-receptor antagonist, shows greater antinociceptive efficacy and a superior preclinical safety profile and it should be considered as a unique beta-adrenergic receptor compound to advance future clinical pain studies.

DIAbet Genetics Replication Meta-A	Genetic fine mapping and genomic annotation defines causal mechanisms at type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							LARGE-SCALE ASSOCIATION; HUMAN PANCREATIC-ISLETS; WIDE ASSOCIATION; BETA-CELL; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; GLUCOSE-HOMEOSTASIS; GENOTYPE IMPUTATION; INSULIN-SECRETION; COMMON VARIANTS; GLYCEMIC TRAITS	We performed fine mapping of 39 established type 2 diabetes (T2D) loci in 27,206 cases and 57,574 controls of European ancestry. We identified 49 distinct association signals at these loci, including five mapping in or near KCNQ1. 'Credible sets' of the variants most likely to drive each distinct signal mapped predominantly to noncoding sequence, implying that association with T2D is mediated through gene regulation. Credible set variants were enriched for overlap with FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation binding sites in human islet and liver cells, including at MTNR1B, where fine mapping implicated rs10830963 as driving T2D association. We confirmed that the T2D risk allele for this SNP increases FOXA2-bound enhancer activity in islet- and liver-derived cells. We observed allele-specific differences in NEUROD1 binding in islet-derived cells, consistent with evidence that the T2D risk allele increases islet MTNR1B expression. Our study demonstrates how integration of genetic and genomic information can define molecular mechanisms through which variants underlying association signals exert their effects on disease.

Recent findings indicate that FoxOs are also involved in the development of major depressive disorder. Alterations in the upstream molecules of FoxOs, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor or protein kinase B, have been linked to depression. Antidepressants, such as imipramine and venlafaxine, modify the FoxOs phosphorylation. Furthermore, FoxOs could be regulated by serotonin and norepinephrine receptor signaling as well as the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, all of which are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. FoxOs also regulate neuronal morphology, synaptogenesis and adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which are viewed as candidate mechanisms for the etiology of depression. In this review, we emphasize the possible roles of FoxOs during the development of depression and make some strategic recommendations for future research. We propose that FoxOs and its signaling pathways may constitute potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of depression. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is linked to a worsening of clinical outcome and to antipsychotic treatment failure. Here we investigated the role of striatal subregions [nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate-putamen (CPu)] in the expression of antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity. We treated rats with haloperidol (HAL) or olanzapine (OLZ), using regimens that achieve clinically relevant kinetics of striatal D2 receptor occupancy. Under these conditions, HAL produces dopamine supersensitivity whereas OLZ does not. We then assessed behaviors evoked by the dopamine agonist amphetamine (AMPH). We either injected AMPH into the striatum or inhibited striatal function with microinjections of GABA receptor agonists prior to injecting AMPH systemically. HAL-treated rats were dopamine supersensitive, as indicated by sensitization to systemic AMPH-induced potentiation of both locomotor activity and operant responding for a conditioned reward (CR). Intra-CPu injections of AMPH had no effect on these behaviors, in any group. Intra-NAc injections of AMPH enhanced operant responding for CR in OLZ-treated and control rats, but not in HAL-treated rats. In HAL-treated rats, inhibition of the NAc also failed to disrupt systemic AMPH-induced potentiation of operant responding for CR. Furthermore, while intra-NAc AMPH enhanced locomotion in both HAL-treated and control animals, inhibition of the NAc disrupted systemic AMPH-induced locomotion only in control rats. Thus, antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity persistently disrupts NAc function, such that some behaviors that normally depend upon NAc dopamine no longer do so. This has implications for understanding dysfunctions in dopamine-mediated behaviors in patients undergoing chronic antipsychotic treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They then tested whether these alterations are specific to anhedonia as compared with low mood and whether they are predictive of depressive outcomes. Method: Functional MRI was used to collect blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses to anticipation of reward in the monetary incentive task in 1,576 adolescents in a community-based sample. Adolescents with current subthreshold depression and clinical depression were compared with matched healthy subjects. In addition, BOLD responses were compared across adolescents with anhedonia, low mood, or both symptoms, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Results: Activity in the ventral striatum was reduced in participants with subthreshold and clinical depression relative to healthy comparison subjects. Low ventral striatum activation predicted transition to subthreshold or clinical depression in previously healthy adolescents at 2-year follow-up. Brain responses during reward anticipation decreased in a graded manner between healthy adolescents, adolescents with current or future subthreshold depression, and adolescents with current or future clinical depression. Low ventral striatum activity was associated with anhedonia but not low mood; however, the combined presence of both symptoms showed the strongest reductions in the ventral striatum in all analyses. Conclusions: The findings suggest that reduced striatal activation operates as a mechanism across the risk spectrum for depression. It is associated with anhedonia in healthy adolescents and is a behavioral indicator of positive valence systems, consistent with predictions based on the Research Domain Criteria.

Methylprednisolone Does Not Reduce Persistent Pain after Cardiac Surgery	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							CHRONIC POSTSURGICAL PAIN; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; RISK-FACTORS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; DOUBLE-BLIND; VALIDATION; DEXAMETHASONE; PREVENTION; PREVALENCE	Background: Persistent incisional pain is common after cardiac surgery and is believed to be in part related to inflammation and poorly controlled acute pain. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid with substantial antiinflammatory and analgesic properties and is thus likely to ameliorate persistent surgical pain. Therefore, the authors tested the primary hypothesis that patients randomized to methylprednisolone have less persistent incisional pain than those given placebo. Methods: One thousand forty-three patients having cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery via a median sternotomy were included in this substudy of Steroids in Cardiac Surgery (SIRS) trial. Patients were randomized to 500 mg intraoperative methylprednisolone or placebo. Incisional pain was assessed at 30 days and 6 months after surgery, and the potential risk factors were also evaluated. Results: Methylprednisolone administration did not reduce pain at 30 days or persistent incisional pain at 6 months, which occurred in 78 of 520 patients (15.7%) in the methylprednisolone group and in 88 of 523 patients (17.8%) in the placebo group. The odds ratio for methylprednisolone was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.09, P = 0.37). Furthermore, there was no difference in worst pain and average pain in the last 24 h, pain interference with daily life, or use of pain medicine at 6 months. Younger age, female sex, and surgical infections were associated with the development of persistent incisional pain. Conclusions: Intraoperative methylprednisolone administration does not reduce persistent incisional pain at 6 months in patients recovering from cardiac surgery.

Several biological pathways linking social adversity to health outcomes are heavily investigated in the aims of facilitating early identification and prevention of adverse health outcomes. We provide a practice-orientated overview of the allostatic load model and how it relates to metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidity in psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: Allostatic load brings together a set of neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and cardiovascular biomarkers that are elevated in individuals with adverse early life experiences and are predictive of cardiovascular and metabolic risk in psychiatric illness of critical importance for Indigenous Australians.

The organization of neural circuitry to form a map of sensory activation is critical for the interpretation of these sensory stimuli. In rodents, social communication relies strongly on the detection of chemosignals by the vomeronasal system, which regulates a wide array of behaviours, including mate recognition, reproduction, and aggression. The binding of these chemosignals to receptors on vomeronasal sensory neurons leads to activation of second-order neurons within glomeruli of the accessory olfactory bulb. Here, vomeronasal receptor activation by a stimulus is organized into maps of glomerular activation that represent phenotypic qualities of the stimuli detected. Genetic, electrophysiological and imaging studies have shed light on the principles underlying cell connectivity and sensory map formation in the vomeronasal system, and have revealed important differences in sensory coding between the vomeronasal and main olfactory system. In this review, we summarize the key factors and mechanisms that dictate circuit formation and sensory coding logic in the vomeronasal system, emphasizing differences with the main olfactory system. Furthermore, we discuss how detection of chemosignals by the vomeronasal system regulates social behaviour in mice, specifically aggression.

Different aspects of food can elicit the brain's reward system. In the present study we set out to investigate differences in brain activity evoked by pleasant food and non-food odors, with a particular focus on dopaminergic brain regions. We measured cerebral activity in 23 participants by means of magnetic resonance imaging, who were stimulated with three food odors (strawberry, orange, and mango) and three non-food odors (lily of the valley, jasmine, and lavender). We acquired functional images using a block stimulation design. Participants also evaluated pleasantness, intensity, and edibility of the odorants. Food odors elicited larger activations in the left postcentral gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus, and in the midbrain. However, despite careful piloting, food odors were on average rated as significantly more intense than the flower odors. We therefore restricted the subsequent analysis to odors which were matched with regard to intensity and pleasantness. Thus, comparing strawberry and lavender odor yielded significant activations in the right cingulate, the midbrain, and the insula bilaterally. We further extracted the percentage of signal change from the global mean (beta) for all odorants in all subjects' ventral tegmental area, which revealed stronger signal change when subjects smelled food odors compared to flower odors. These results indicate that food-related odors may activate dopaminergic pathways in the brain, possibly due to a conditioned association.

Previous findings from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) cohort study found increased prenatal levels of DDT and its breakdown product dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE) to be associated with altered neurodevelopment in children at 1 and 2 years of age. In this study, we combined the measured maternal DDT/E concentrations during pregnancy obtained for the prospective birth cohort with predicted prenatal DDT and DDE levels estimated for a retrospective birth cohort. Using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and linear regression models, we,evaluated the relationship of prenatal maternal. DDT and DDE serum concentrations with children's cognition at ages 7 and 10.5 years as assessed using the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and 4 subtest scores (Working Memory, Perceptual Reasoning, Verbal Comprehension, and Processing Speed) of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). In GEE analyses incorporating both age 7 and 10.5 scores (n = 619), we found prenatal DDT and DDE levels were not associated with Full Scale IQ or any of the WISC subscales (p-value > 0.05). In linear regression analyses assessing each time point separately, prenatal DDT levels were inversely associated with Processing Speed at age 7 years (n = 316), but prenatal DDT and DDE levels were not associated with Full Scale IQ or any of the WISC subscales at age 10.5 years (n = 595). We found evidence for effect modification by sex. In girls, but not boys, prenatal DDE levels were inversely associated with Full Scale IQ and Processing Speed at age 7 years. We conclude that prenatal DDT levels may be associated with delayed Processing Speed in children at age 7 years and the relationship between prenatal DDE levels and children's cognitive development may be modified by sex, with girls being more adversely affected.

Distal innervation deficiency results from incomplete colonization of the bowel by enteric neural crest cells (eNCCs), the ENS precursors. Here, we report the generation of a mouse model for HSCR - named Holstein - that contains an untargeted transgenic insertion upstream of the collagen(Col6a4) gene. This insertion induces eNCC-specific upregulation of Col6a4 expression that increases total collagen VI protein levels in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding both the developing and the postnatal ENS. Increased collagen VI levels during development mainly result in slower migration of eNCCs. This appears to be due to the fact that collagen VI is a poor substratum for supporting eNCC migration and can even interfere with the migration-promoting effects of fibronectin. Importantly, for a majority of patients in a HSCR cohort, the myenteric ganglia from the ganglionated region are also specifically surrounded by abundant collagen VI microfibrils, an outcome accentuated by Down syndrome. Collectively, our data thus unveil a clinically relevant pathogenic mechanism for HSCR that involves cell-autonomous changes in ECM composition surrounding eNCCs. Moreover, as COL6A1 and COL6A2 are on human Chr.21q, this mechanism is highly relevant to the predisposition of patients with Down syndrome to HSCR.

Despite intensive years of research, the etiology of this neurological disorder remains elusive. Nevertheless, the abundance of immune cells such as T lymphocytes and their products in CNS lesions of MS patients supports the notion that MS is an immune-mediated disorder. An important body of evidence gathered from MS animal models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), points to the central contribution of CD4 T lymphocytes in disease pathogenesis. Both Th1 (producing interferon-gamma) and Th17 (producing interleukin 17) CD4 T lymphocytes targeting CNS self-antigens have been implicated in MS and EAE pathobiology. Moreover, several publications suggest that CD8 T lymphocytes also participate in the development of MS lesions. The migration of activated T lymphocytes from the periphery into the CNS has been identified as a crucial step in the formation of MS lesions. Several factors promote such T cell extravasation including: molecules (e.g., cell adhesion molecules) implicated in the T cell-blood brain barrier interaction, and chemokines produced by neural cells. Finally, once in the CNS, T lymphocytes need to be reactivated by local antigen presenting cells prior to enter the parenchyma where they can initiate damage. Further investigations will be necessary to elucidate the impact of environmental factors (e.g., gut microbiota) and CNS intrinsic properties (e.g., microglial activation) on this inflammatory neurological disease.

In fact, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown a link between genes involved in neuroinflammation and AD. In order to further investigate whether interactions between candidate genetic variances coding for neuroinflammatory molecules are associated with brain amyloid beta (A beta) fibrillary accumulation, we conducted an epistasis analysis on a pool of genes associated with molecular mediators of inflammation. Methods: [F-18] Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was employed to assess brain A beta levels in 417 participants from ADNI-GO/2 and posteriorly 174 from ADNI-1. IL-1 beta, IL4, IL6, IL6r, IL10, IL12, IL18, C5, and C9 genes were chosen based on previous studies conducted in AD patients. Using the [F-18] florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) as a quantitative measure of fibrillary A beta, epistasis analyses were performed between two sets of markers of immune-related genes using gender, diagnosis, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) as covariates. Voxel-based analyses were also conducted. The results were corrected for multiple comparison tests. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A beta(1-42)/phosphorylated tau (p-tau) ratio concentrations were used to confirm such associations. Results: Epistasis analysis unveiled two significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP interactions (false discovery rate (FDR) threshold 0.1), both interactions between C9 gene (rs261752) and IL6r gene (rs4240872, rs7514452). In a combined sample, the interactions were confirmed (p <= 10-5) and associated with amyloid accumulation within cognitively normal and AD spectrum groups. Voxel-based analysis corroborated initial findings. CSF biomarker (A beta(1-42)/p-tau) confirmed the genetic interaction. Additionally, rs4240872 and rs7514452 SNPs were shown to be associated with CSF and plasma concentrations of IL6r protein. Conclusions: Certain allele combinations involving IL6r and C9 genes are associated with A beta burden in the brain. Hypothesis-driven search for epistasis is a valuable strategy for investigating imaging endophenotypes in complex neurodegenerative diseases.

Increasing placebo responses over time in US clinical trials of neuropathic pain	PAIN			English	Article						Neuropathic; Clinical trials; Placebo; Trends; Geography	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; DIABETIC NEUROPATHY; META-REGRESSION; METAANALYSIS; ANALGESIA; PREDICTORS; DEPRESSION	Recent failures of clinical trials of novel analgesics designed to treat neuropathic pain have led to much speculation about the underlying reasons. One often discussed possibility is that the placebo response in these trials has increased in recent years, leading to lower separation between the drug and placebo arms. Whether this has indeed occurred has not yet been adequately addressed. Here, we extracted data from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drugs for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain over the years 1990 to 2013. We find that placebo responses have increased considerably over this period, but drug responses have remained stable, leading to diminished treatment advantage. This trend has been driven by studies conducted in the United States. Consideration of participant and study characteristics revealed that in the United States but not elsewhere, RCTs have increased in study size and length. These changes are associated with larger placebo response. Analysis of individual RCT time courses showed different kinetics for the treatment vs placebo responses, with the former evolving more quickly than the latter and plateauing, such that maximum treatment advantage was achieved within 4 weeks.

Aim: To illustrate one of the ways in which hospice caregivers conceptualize end-of-life delirium and the significance of this conceptualization for the relationships that they form with patients' families in the hospice setting. Design: Ethnography. Setting/participants: Ethnographic fieldwork was conducted at a nine-bed, freestanding residential hospice, located in a suburban community of Eastern Canada. Data collection methods included 15months of participant observation, 28 semi-structured audio-recorded interviews with hospice caregivers, and document analysis. Results: Hospice caregivers draw on a culturally established framework of normal dying to help families come to terms with clinical end-of-life phenomena, including delirium. By offering explanations about delirium as a natural feature of the dying process, hospice caregivers strive to protect for families the integrity of the good death ideal. Conclusion: Within hospice culture, there is usefulness to deemphasizing delirium as a pathological neuropsychiatric complication, in favor of acknowledging delirious changes as signs of normal dying. This has implications for how we understand the role of nurses and other caregivers with respect to delirium assessment and care, which to date has focused largely on practices of screening and management.

Children with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and single-bone CNS-risk lesions have been reported to be at increased risk of diabetes insipidus (DI), central nervous system neurodegeneration (CNS-ND), and recurrence of disease. However, it is unknown whether the addition of chemotherapy or radiotherapy changes outcomes in these patients. Methods. Ten pediatric institutions across North America and Europe contributed data of their patients with LCH and single-bone CNS-risk lesions. Clinical information on age, sex, specific craniofacial site involvement, and intracranial extension at diagnosis, therapy, and disease course was collected for all eligible patients. Results. The final analysis included 93 eligible children who were either treated with systemic therapy (chemotherapy, chemo-radiotherapy, or radiotherapy) or local therapy (biopsy, curettage, and/or intralesional steroids). Fifty-nine patients had systemic and 34 had local therapy. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 80 +/- 5% and 98 +/- 2% in the systemic therapy group versus 85 +/- 6% and 95 +/- 5% in the local therapy group. There was no statistically significant difference between either group with regard to EFS (P = 0.26) and OS (P = 0.78). On multivariable analysis, there was no significant difference among the two treatment groups after adjusting for site and intracranial soft tissue extension, nor any trend favoring systemic therapy (HR = 2.26, 95% CI = 0.77-6.70; P = 0.14). Conclusion. Systemic therapy may not reduce the risk of recurrence or late sequelae in children with LCH and single-bone CNS-risk lesions as compared to local treatment.

The risk of increased left ventricular (LV) wall stress, irreversible myocardial fibrosis and sudden death in untreated patients warrants earlier intervention. The timing for curative therapy for severe AVS is clear, but optimal timing for moderate stenosis (modAS) is unknown. AVS often coexists with aortic regurgitation, which adds a volume overload to an already pressure-overloaded LV, adding an additional challenge to the estimation of disease severity. We investigated the possible value of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) upon treadmill exercise challenge in children with asymptomatic modAS versus moderate regurgitation (modAR). The aim was to determine optimal timing of peak biochemical response. Blood samples were obtained at rest, and then at 20, 40 and 60 min after peak exercise comparing modAS and modAR to healthy controls. Exercise performance was equivalent in all groups, with no difference for biomarker levels at rest. The increase in NT-proBNP was significant in modAR at 40 min (99.2 +/- A 48.6 ng/L; p = 0.04) and 60 min into recovery (100.0 +/- A 53.7 ng/L; p = 0.01), but not in modAS. The increase in hs-cTnT was significant only at 60 min into recovery for modAS and modAR. NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT following exercise challenge are possible discriminant biomarkers of modAR from modAS and controls at 60 min into recovery despite comparable exercise performance. This offers a promising avenue for future stratification of aortic valve disease and optimal timing of intervention.

J	Ramstead, MJD				Ramstead, Maxwell J. D.			Naturalizing what? Varieties of naturalism and transcendental phenomenology	PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Article						Phenomenology; Cognitive science; Naturalization; Epistemology; Constitution (phenomenology); Transcendentalism(phenomenology)	EMULATION THEORY; CONSCIOUSNESS; HUSSERL; NEUROSCIENCE; EXPERIENCE; PERCEPTION; NOEMA	This paper aims to address the relevance of the natural sciences for transcendental phenomenology, that is, the issue of naturalism. The first section distinguishes three varieties of naturalism and corresponding forms of naturalization: an ontological one, a methodological one (with strong and weak variants), and an epistemological one (also with strong and weak variants). In light of these distinctions, in the second section, I examine the main projects aiming to "naturalize phenomenology": neurophenomenology, front-loaded phenomenology, and formalized approaches to phenomenology. The third section then considers the commitments of Husserl's transcendental phenomenology with respect to the three varieties of naturalism previously discussed. I argue that Husserl rejected strong and weak forms of epistemological naturalism, strong methodological naturalism, and ontological naturalism. The fourth section presents the argument that Husserl endorsed a weak, conditional form of methodological naturalism. This point is illustrated with Husserl's proposal of "somatology," a natural science apt to study the corporeality of the lived body. The final section addresses the complementarity and respective limits of the transcendental phenomenological and the natural scientific frameworks. I argue that, on Husserl's account, the function of transcendental phenomenology with respect to the natural sciences is to provide them with an epistemological foundation and an ontological clarification. I suggest that certain natural sciences can be understood, within the transcendental phenomenological framework, as "sciences of constitution," that is, as sciences investigating the contribution of real structures acting as conditions of possibility for the occurrence of certain kinds of comprehensive unities in lived experience.

Combined effect of G3139 and TSPO ligands on Ca2+-induced permeability transition in rat brain mitochondria	ARCHIVES OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS			English	Article						VDAC; TSPO; Mitochondria; Permeability transition pore; PK11195; G3139	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; PROTEIN 18 KDA; DEPENDENT ANION CHANNEL; TRANSLOCATOR-PROTEIN; CHOLESTEROL-BINDING; OUTER-MEMBRANE; IN-VIVO; CANCER-CELLS; VDAC; APOPTOSIS	Permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane is determined by the activity of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) which are regulated by many factors and proteins. One of the main partner-regulator of VDAC is the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), whose role in the regulation of membrane permeability is not completely understood. We show that TSPO ligands, 1 mu M PPIX and PK11195 at concentrations of 50 mu M, accelerate opening of permeability transition pores (mPTP) in Ca2+-overloaded rat brain mitochondria (RBM). By contrast, PK11195 at 100 nM and anti-TSPO antibodies suppressed pore opening. Participation of VDAC in these processes was demonstrated by blocking VDAC with G3139, an 18-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, which sensitized mitochondria to Ca2+-induced mPTP opening. Despite the inhibitory effect of 100 nM PK11195 and anti-TSPO antibodies alone, their combination with G3139 considerably stimulated the mPTP opening. Thus, 100 nM PK11195 and anti-TSPO antibody can modify permeability of the VDAC channel and mPTP. When VDAC channels are closed and TSPO is blocked, permeability of the VDAC for calcium seems to be the highest, which leads to accelerated pore opening. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Behavioral signs of pain and functional impairment in a mouse model of osteogenesis imperfecta	BONE			English	Article						Col1a1(Jrt)/+; Hypersensitivity; Osteogenesis imperfecta; Pain; Skeletal deformity; Collagen mutation	RAT MODEL; SKELETAL PAIN; FRACTURE PAIN; BONE; OSTEOCLASTS; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; ALLODYNIA; FIBERS	Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a congenital disorder caused most often by dominant mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes that encode the alpha chains of type I collagen. Severe forms of OI are associated with skeletal deformities and frequent fractures. Skeletal pain can occur acutely after fracture, but also arises chronically without preceding fractures. In this study we assessed OI-associated pain in the Col1a1Jrt/+ mouse, a recently developed model of severe dominant OI. Similar to severe OI in humans, this mouse has significant skeletal abnormalities and develops spontaneous fractures, joint dislocations and vertebral deformities. In this model, we investigated behavioral measures of pain and functional impairment. Significant hypersensitivity to mechanical, heat and cold stimuli, assessed by von Frey filaments, radiant heat paw withdrawal and the acetone tests, respectively, were observed in OI compared to control wildtype littermates. OI mice also displayed reduced motor activity in the running wheel and open field assays. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed no changes between OI and WT mice in innervation of the glabrous skin of the hindpaw or in expression of the pain-related neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related protein in sensory neurons. In contrast, increased sensitivity to mechanical and cold stimulation strongly correlated with the extent of skeletal deformities in OI mice. Thus, we demonstrated that the Col1a1Jrt/+ mouse model of severe OI has hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli, consistent with a state of chronic pain. (C) 2OI5 Elsevier Inc.

This in vivo study aimed at evaluating the effects of static and dynamic compression application and subsequent removal on bone growth, mineralization and neuropathic pain markers in growing rats. Forty-eight immature rats (28 days old) were assigned in two groups (2- and 4 weeks experiment duration) and four subgroups: control, sham, static, and dynamic. Controls had no surgery. A micro-loading device was implanted on the 6th and 8th caudal vertebrae of shams without loading, static loading at 0.2 MPa or dynamic loading at 02 MPa +/- 30% and 0.1 Hz. In 2-week subgroups, compression was maintained for 15 days prior to euthanasia, while in 4-week subgroups, compression was removed for 10 additional days. Growth rates, histomorphometric parameters and mineralization intensity were quantified and compared. At 2 weeks, growth rates and growth plate heights of loaded groups (static/dynamic) were significantly lower than shams (p < 0.01). However, at 4 weeks, both growth rates and growth plate heights of loaded groups were similar to shams. At 4 weeks, alizarin red intensity was significantly higher in dynamics compared to shams (p < 0.05) and controls (p < 0.01). Both static and dynamic compressions enable growth resumption after loading removal, while preserving growth plate histomorphometric integrity. However, mineralization was enhanced after dynamic loading removal only. Dynamic loading showed promising results for fusionless treatment approaches for musculoskeletal deformities.

It was eventually concluded that plasticity depends on many factors, including cell type. More recently, it has become increasingly clear that plasticity is regulated at an even finer grained level; it is specific to the synapse type, a concept we denote synapse-type-specific plasticity (STSP). Here, we review recent developments in the field of STSP, discussing both long-term and short-term variants and with particular emphasis on neocortical function. As there are dozens of neocortical cell types, there is a multiplicity of forms of STSP, the vast majority of which have never been explored. We argue that to understand the brain and synaptic diseases, we have to grapple with STSP.	[Larsen, Rylan S.] Allen Inst Brain Sci, Seattle, WA 98103 USA; [Sjoestroem, P.

The Toronto group (Kulkarni et al.) developed the ETV Success Score (ETVSS) to predict the clinical response following ETV based on age, previous shunt, and cause of hydrocephalus in a pediatric population. However, the use of the ETVSS has not been validated for a population comprising adults. The objective of this study was to validate the ETVSS in a "closed-skull" population, including patients 2 years of age and older. METHODS In this retrospective observational study, medical charts of all consecutive cases of ETV performed in two university hospitals were reviewed. The primary outcome, the success of ETV, was defined as the absence of reoperation or death attributable to hydrocephalus at 6 months. The ETVSS was calculated for all patients. Discriminative properties along with calibration of the ETVSS were established for the study population. The secondary outcome is the reoperation-free survival. " RESULTS This study included 168 primary ETVs. The mean age was 40 years (range 3-85 years). ETV was successful at 6 months in 126 patients (75%) compared with a mean ETVSS of 82.4%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.61, revealing insufficient discrimination from the ETVSS in this population. In contrast, calibration of the ETVSS was excellent (calibration slope = 1.01), although the expected low numbers were obtained for scores <70. Decision curve analyses demonstrate that ETVSS is marginally beneficial in clinical decision-making, a reduction of 4 and 2 avoidable ETVs per 100 cases if the threshold used on the ETVSS is set at 70 and 60, respectively. However, the use of the ETVSS showed inferior net benefit when compared with the strategy of not recommending ETV at all as a surgical option for thresholds set at 80 and 90. In this cohort, neither age nor previous shunt were significantly associated with unsuccessful ETV. However, better outcomes were achieved in patients with aqueductal stenosis, tectal compressions, and other tumor-associated hydrocephalus than in cases secondary to myelomeningocele, infection, or hemorrhage (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS The ETVSS did not show adequate discrimination but demonstrated excellent calibration in this population of patients 2 years and older. According to decision-curve analyses, the ETVSS is marginally useful in clinical scenarios in which 60% or 70% success rates are the thresholds for preferring ETV to CSF shunt. Previous history of CSF shunt and age were not associated with worse outcomes, whereas Posthemorrhagic and postinfectious causes of the hydrocephalus were significantly associated with reduced success rated following ETV.

However, thus far, its spreading through the central nervous system (CNS) has not been completely elucidated. The authors present a case of multiple L. monocytogenes cerebral abscesses characterized by a pattern of distribution that suggested spread along white matter fiber tracts and reviewed the literature to identify other cases for analysis. They elected to include only those cases with 3 or more cerebral abscesses to make sure that the distribution was not random, but rather followed a pattern. In addition, they included those cases with abscesses in both the brainstem and the cerebral hemispheres, but excluded cases in which abscesses were located solely in the brainstem. Of 77 cases of L. monocyto genes CNS abscesses found in the literature, 17 involved multiple abscesses. Of those, 6 were excluded for lack of imaging and 3 because they involved only the brainstem. Of the 8 remaining cases from the literature, one was a case of bilateral abscesses that did not follow a fiber tract; another was also bilateral, but with lesions appearing to follow fiber tracts on one side; and in the remaining 6, to which the authors added their own case for a total of 7, all the abscesses were located exclusively in the same hemisphere and distributed along white matter fiber tracts. The findings suggest that after entering the CNS, L. monocyto genes travels within the axons, resulting in a characteristic pattern of distribution of multiple abscesses along the white matter fiber tracts in the brain. This report is the first description suggesting intraaxonal CNS spread of L. monocytogenes infection in humans following its entry into the brain. This distinct pattern is clearly seen on imaging and its recognition may be valuable in the di'agnosis of listeriosis. This finding may allow for earlier diagnosis, which may improve outcome.

Transcription factor Nr4a1 couples sympathetic and inflammatory cues in CNS-recruited macrophages to limit neuroinflammation	NATURE IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; NUCLEAR RECEPTOR; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; LEWIS RAT; NGFI-B; PRAZOSIN TREATMENT; CELL-DEVELOPMENT; GENE-EXPRESSION	The molecular mechanisms that link the sympathetic stress response and inflammation remain obscure. Here we found that the transcription factor Nr4a1 regulated the production of norepinephrine (NE) in macrophages and thereby limited experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Lack of Nr4a1 in myeloid cells led to enhanced NE production, accelerated infiltration of leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS) and disease exacerbation in vivo. In contrast, myeloid-specific deletion of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, protected mice against EAE. Furthermore, we found that Nr4a1 repressed autocrine NE production in macrophages by recruiting the corepressor CoREST to the Th promoter. Our data reveal a new role for macrophages in neuroinflammation and identify Nr4a1 as a key regulator of catecholamine production by macrophages.

Comparatively, sex-differences in brain connectivity received little attention, despite evidence for important fronto-limbic connections during emotion processing across sexes. Here, we investigated sex-differences in fronto-limbic connectivity during negative emotion processing. Methods: Forty-six healthy individuals (25 women, 21 men) viewed negative, positive and neutral images during an fMRI session. Effective connectivity between significantly activated regions was examined using Granger causality and psychophysical interaction analyses. Sex steroid hormones and feminine-masculine traits were also measured. Results: Subjective ratings of negative emotional images were higher in women than in men. Across sexes, significant activations were observed in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the right amygdala. Granger connectivity from right amygdala was significantly greater than that from dmPFC during the 'high negative' condition, an effect driven by men. Magnitude of this effect correlated negatively with highly negative image ratings and feminine traits and positively with testosterone levels. Discussion: These results highlight critical sex differences in brain connectivity during negative emotion processing and point to the fact that both biological (sex steroid hormones) and psychosocial (gender role and identity) variables contribute to them. As the dmPFC is involved in social cognition and action planning, and the amygdala in threat detection, the connectivity results suggest that compared to women, men have a more evaluative, rather than purely affective, brain response during negative emotion processing.

Postconcussion symptoms are frequent after traumatic brain injury (TBI) but their relationship with sexual quality of life remains unexplored. The current study aimed to: (a) compare sexual quality of life in a sample of individuals with TBI and healthy controls; and (b) explore the relationship between sexual quality of life and postconcussion symptoms in individuals with TBI. Forty-one individuals with TBI and 41 healthy controls, comparable in age, gender, years of education, work and relationship status, and annual income. Sexual quality of life was assessed with the self-report Sexual Quality of Life Questionnaire, and postconcussion symptoms with the Post-concussion Symptom Scale. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with TBI showed significantly lower sexual quality of life. In individuals with TBI, diminished sexual quality of life was significantly associated with self-reported postconcussion symptoms; the affective factor of the Post-concussion Symptom Scale provided the most unique contribution to sexual quality of life. Affective postconcussion symptoms could partially explain the impact of TBI on sexual quality of life. Ongoing screening and treatment of postconcussion symptoms, in particular affective symptoms, may lead to a secondary remediation/prevention of sexual difficulties in individuals with TBI.

Neurosurgical Assessment of Metrics Including Judgment and Dexterity Using the Virtual Reality Simulator NeuroTouch (NAJD Metrics)	SURGICAL INNOVATION			English	Article						NeuroTouch; NAJD Metrics; neurosurgical simulation; performance metrics; bimanual dexterity; neurosurgical judgment; brain tumor resection	EXPERIENCE; RESECTION; SURGERY; IMPACT	Advances in computer-based technology has created a significant opportunity for implementing new training paradigms in neurosurgery focused on improving skill acquisition, enhancing procedural outcome, and surgical skills assessment. NeuroTouch is a computer-based virtual reality system that can generate output data known as metrics from operator performance during simulated brain tumor resection. These measures of quantitative assessment are used to track and compare psychomotor performance during simulated operative procedures. Data output from the NeuroTouch system is recorded in a comma-separated values file. Data mining from this file and subsequent metrics development requires the use of sophisticated software and engineering expertise. In this article, we introduce a system to extract a series of new metrics using the same data file using Excel software. Based on the data contained in the NeuroTouch comma-separated values file, 13 novel NeuroTouch metrics were developed and classified. Tier 1 metrics include blood loss, tumor percentage resected, and total simulated normal brain volume removed. Tier 2 metrics include total instrument tip path length, maximum force applied, sum of forces utilized, and average forces utilized by the simulated ultrasonic aspirator and suction instrument along with pedal activation frequency of the ultrasonic aspirator. Advanced tier 2 metrics include instrument tips average separation distance, efficiency index, ultrasonic aspirator path length index, coordination index, and ultrasonic aspirator bimanual forces ratio. This system of data extraction provides researchers expedited access for analyzing the data files available for NeuroTouch platform to assess the multiple psychomotor and cognitive neurosurgical skills involved in complex surgical procedures.

A randomized trial comparing axillary block versus targeted intracluster injection supraclavicular block for upper limb surgery	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article							BRACHIAL-PLEXUS BLOCK; MINIMUM EFFECTIVE VOLUME; ULTRASOUND; LIDOCAINE	Purpose This randomized trial aimed to validate a new method for brachial plexus blockade, i.e., targeted intracluster injection supraclavicular block (TII SCB), by comparing it with ultrasound-guided axillary block (AXB). We hypothesized that TII SCB would result in a shorter total anesthesia-related time. Methods Forty patients undergoing upper limb surgery were randomized to ultrasound-guided TII SCB (n = 20) or AXB (n = 20). In the TII SCB group, we deposited 16 mL of lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5 A mu g center dot mL(-1) into the largest neural cluster (i.e., brachial plexus trunks/divisions). Subsequently, an additional 16 mL was divided into equal aliquots and injected inside each satellite cluster. In the AXB group, 5.5 mL were deposited around the musculocutaneous nerve and 23.5 mL were injected at the 6 o'clock position of the axillary artery. The main outcome for comparison between the two groups was the total anesthesia-related time (defined as the sum of block performance and onset times). We also recorded the number of needle passes, procedural pain, and complications (vascular puncture, paresthesia). Results The TII SCB method provided a quicker mean (SD) onset time compared with the AXB group [9.5 (5.8) min vs 18.9 (6.1) min; mean difference, -9.5 min; 99% CI, -14.7 to -4.2; P < 0.001] and a shorter mean (SD) total anesthesia-related time [20.1 (5.0) min vs 27.2 (6.5) min; mean difference, -7.0 min; 95% CI, -10.9 to -3.1; P = 0.001]. There were no intergroup differences in terms of success rate (95%), procedural pain, vascular puncture and paresthesia. The AXB group displayed a faster performance time [8.2 (1.6) min vs 10.6 (2.6) min; P = 0.001] with fewer median [interquartile range] needle passes (3 [2-6] vs 5 [4-8]; P < 0.001). Conclusion Ultrasound-guided TII SCB provides a quicker onset and a shorter total anesthesia-related time than ultrasound-guided AXB.

These recommendations are based on a review of current publications available in the literature. Principal findings Persistent postsurgical pain has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as clinical discomfort that lasts more than two months after surgery. Recent reviews reported that 10-50% of patients develop chronic pain after surgery, 2-10% with disabling chronic pain at six months. Preventive interventions should target all types of surgery, but specific attention should be placed on surgical insults that carry a high risk of pain chronicization. Regional anesthesia (RA) should be used whenever feasible, and a continuous perineural/epidural local anesthetic infusion is preferred over a single-shot technique. The RA should be initiated prior to the surgical incision and then continued for at least 24-72 hr after the surgery. Perioperative opioids should be used for nociceptive stimuli not managed by the RA. An intravenous infusion of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonist, might be added for a further decrease in neuronal sensitization, especially when the procedure is extensive or when RA is not feasible or contraindicated. A multimodal approach is always suggested. The literature still does not strongly support the use of gabapentinoids for PPSP prevention; however, they might be maintained in patients who use them preoperatively. Conclusions A winning strategy to reduce the incidence of PPSP may well involve performing minimally invasive surgery, providing adequate perioperative analgesia based on RA, and using a multimodal approach with NMDA antagonists.

J	Lu, J; Xiong, SH; Arora, N; Dube, L				Lu, Ji; Xiong, Suhong; Arora, Narendra; Dube, Laurette			Using food as reinforcer to shape children's non-food behavior: The adverse nutritional effect doubly moderated by reward sensitivity and gender	EATING BEHAVIORS			English	Article						Food rules; Instrumental learning; Reinforcement; Sensitivity to reward; Dietary pattern	PREFERENCES; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; PRESCHOOL; SCALES	Purpose: Control rules are parental practices that use food, especially those high in fat or sugar, as an instrumental reinforcer to encourage children to behave in a normative manner in non-food domains. Past laboratory experiments show that repeatedly presenting snacks as a reward or associated with adults' attention, increases children's preference for the presented food. This field study aims to examine whether control rules are associated with children's increased everyday intake of food high in sugar/fat, and whether this effect is moderated by individual differences in neurobehavioral sensitivity to reward and in gender. Design: 207 six-to twelve-year-old children's parents reported the children's everyday dietary intake through a food frequency questionnaire and provided information regarding the children's sensitivity to rewards as well as the frequency of enforcing control rules. Results: Children who lived in families with a high frequency of using control rules exhibited more daily fat, carbohydrate, and total energy intake than did children whose parents use control rules less often. Furthermore, the effect of control rules on dietary pattern was particularly strong for children with high reward sensitivity, especially boys. Conclusions: Control rules have adverse consequences on children's nutrition. The moderating effects of sensitivity to reward and gender are consistent to a reinforcement learning process-associating the high-fat/sugar food consumption with social-affective pleasure resulting from performing behavior desired by parents-through which parental control rules contribute to children's maladaptive dietary patterns.

Impaired decision-making in symptomatic anorexia and bulimia nervosa patients: a meta-analysis	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Review						Decision-making; eating disorders; Iowa gambling task	BINGE-EATING DISORDER; IOWA-GAMBLING-TASK; CENTRAL COHERENCE; COGNITIVE REMEDIATION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WOMEN; REWARD; BRAIN; INDIVIDUALS	Background. Impaired decision-making is a potential neurocognitive phenotype of eating disorders. It is therefore important to disentangle the decision-making deficits associated with the eating disorder subtypes and determine whether this putative impairment is a state or trait marker of the disease or more related to starvation. We systematically reviewed the literature on decision-making in eating disorders and conducted a meta-analysis to explore its role in anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED). Method. A search of the Medline and EMBASE databases and article references was performed. A total of 23 studies (2044 participants) met the selection criteria. When the Iowa gambling task (IGT) was used in at least three of the studies, a meta-analysis was run. Results. IGT performance was significantly worse in patients with an eating disorder diagnosis (AN, BN or BED) compared with healthy controls, indicating that eating disorders have a negative effect on decision-making. Hedges' g effect sizes were moderate to large (-0.72 in AN, -0.62 in BN, and -1.26 in BED). Recovered AN patients had IGT scores similar to those of healthy controls. Restrictive AN patients had significantly lower IGT net scores than purging AN patients, and both AN subtypes had worse performances than healthy controls. Age and body mass index did not explain results. Conclusions. Decision-making was significantly altered in patients with eating disorders. Poor decision-making was more pronounced during the acute phase than in the recovered state of AN. Nutritional status during the acute phase of the disease did not seem to influence decision-making skills.

They use this as an argument in favor of the drift-diffusion model and against the urgency-gating model. However, their implementation of the urgency-gating model is incomplete, as it lacks the low-pass filter that is necessary to deal with noisy input such as the motion signal used in their experimental task. Furthermore, by focusing analyses solely on comparison of mean RTs they overestimate how long early information influences individual trials. Here, we show that if the urgency-gating model is correctly implemented, including a low-pass filter with a 250 ms time constant, it can successfully reproduce the results of the Winkel et al. experiment.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for finding optimal weights and biases for each BPNN. To capture symmetry/asymmetry in the underlying data, three wavelet functions with different shapes are adopted. The proposed ensemble system was tested on three Asian stock markets: The Hang Seng, KOSPI, and Taiwan stock market data. Three statistical metrics were used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy; including, mean of absolute errors (MAE), root mean of squared errors (RMSE), and mean of absolute deviations (MADs). Experimental results showed that our proposed ensemble system outperformed the individual CWT-ANN models each with different wavelet function. In addition, the proposed ensemble system outperformed the conventional autoregressive moving average process. As a result, the proposed ensemble system is suitable to capture symmetry/asymmetry in financial data fluctuations for better prediction accuracy.

Pooled time-series negative binomial regression results are consistent with the ethnic threat hypothesis by indicating that lethal police action is associated with the size of the ethnic minority population in each city. Political accounts are supported as non-linear specifications suggest that once ethnic minorities reach a numerical majority in our sample of cities there is a decline in police killings. Findings also support expectations that greater female representation within policing will reduce the use of lethal force by changing the overall culture of the department. Theoretical implications of our findings are discussed.

Recordings included a 19-lead 10-20 electroencephalogram montage and standard electromyogram, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram and respiratory leads. Sleep spindles were automatically detected using a standard algorithm, and their characteristics (amplitude, duration, density, frequency and frequency slope) compared between groups. Topological analyses of group-discriminative features were conducted. Sleep spindles occurred at a significantly (e.g. t(34)=-4.49; P=0.00008 for C3) lower density (spindles.min(-1)) for RBD (mean +/- SD: 1.61 +/- 0.56 for C3) than for control (2.19 +/- 0.61 for C3) participants. However, when distinguishing slow and fast spindles using thresholds individually adapted to the electroencephalogram spectrum of each participant, densities smaller (31-96%) for fast but larger (20-120%) for slow spindles were observed in RBD in all derivations. Maximal differences were in more posterior regions for slow spindles, but over the entire scalp for fast spindles. Results suggest that the density of sleep spindles is altered in patients with RBD and should therefore be investigated as a potential marker of future neurodegeneration in these patients.

Although excessive daytime somnolence has been associated with cognitive impairment in several sleep disorders, very few data exist concerning sleepwalking. This study aimed to investigate daytime cognitive functioning in adults diagnosed with idiopathic sleepwalking. Fifteen sleepwalkers and 15 matched controls were administered the Continuous Performance Test and Stroop Colour-Word Test in the morning after an overnight polysomnographic assessment. Participants were tested a week later on the same neuropsychological battery, but after 25h of sleep deprivation, a procedure known to precipitate sleepwalking episodes during subsequent recovery sleep. There were no significant differences between sleepwalkers and controls on any of the cognitive tests administered under normal waking conditions. Testing following sleep deprivation revealed significant impairment in sleepwalkers' executive functions related to inhibitory control, as they made more errors than controls on the Stroop Colour-Word Test and more commission errors on the Continuous Performance Test. Sleepwalkers' scores on measures of executive functions were not associated with self-reported sleepiness or indices of sleep fragmentation from baseline polysomnographic recordings. The results support the idea that sleepwalking involves daytime consequences and suggest that these may also include cognitive impairments in the form of disrupted inhibitory control following sleep deprivation. These disruptions may represent a daytime expression of sleepwalking's pathophysiological mechanisms.

Often techniques are compared through computation of required sample size estimates for future clinical trials. However interpretation of such comparisons is rendered complex because, despite using the same publicly available cohorts, the various techniques have been assessed with different data exclusions and different statistical analysis models. We created the MIRIAD atrophy challenge in order to test various capabilities of atrophy measurement techniques. The data consisted of 69 subjects (46 Alzheimer's disease, 23 control) who were scanned multiple (up to twelve) times at nine visits over a follow-up period of one to two years, resulting in 708 total image sets. Nine participating groups from 6 countries completed the challenge by providing volumetric measurements of key structures (whole brain, lateral ventricle, left and right hippocampi) for each dataset and atrophy measurements of these structures for each time point pair (both forward and backward) of a given subject. From these results, we formally compared techniques using exactly the same dataset. First, we assessed the repeatability of each technique using rates obtained from short intervals where no measurable atrophy is expected. For those measures that provided direct measures of atrophy between pairs of images, we also assessed symmetry and transitivity. Then, we performed a statistical analysis in a consistent manner using linear mixed effect models. The models, one for repeated measures of volume made at multiple time-points and a second for repeated "direct" measures of change in brain volume, appropriately allowed for the correlation between measures made on the same subject and were shown to fit the data well. From these models, we obtained estimates of the distribution of atrophy rates in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control groups and of required sample sizes to detect a 25% treatment effect, in relation to healthy ageing, with 95% significance and 80% power over follow-up periods of 6, 12, and 24 months. Uncertainty in these estimates, and head-to-head comparisons between techniques, were carried out using the bootstrap. The lateral ventricles provided the most stable measurements, followed by the brain. The hippocampi had much more variability across participants, likely because of differences in segmentation protocol and less distinct boundaries. Most methods showed no indication of bias based on the short-term interval results, and direct measures provided good consistency in terms of symmetry and transitivity. The resulting annualized rates of change derived from the model ranged from, for whole brain: -1.4% to -2.2% (AD) and -0.35% to -0.67% (control), for ventricles: 4.6% to 10.2% (AD) and 1.2% to 3.4% (control), and for hippocampi: -1.5% to -7.0% (AD) and -0.4% to -1.4% (control). There were large and statistically significant differences in the sample size requirements between many of the techniques. The lowest sample sizes for each of these structures, for a trial with a 12 month follow-up period, were 242 (95% CI: 154 to 422) for whole brain, 168 (95% CI: 112 to 282) for ventricles, 190 (95% CI: 146 to 268) for left hippocampi, and 158 (95% CI: 116 to 228) for right hippocampi. This analysis represents one of the most extensive statistical comparisons of a large number of different atrophy measurement techniques from around the globe. The challenge data will remain online and publicly available so that other groups can assess their methods. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the impact of the resolution of functional brain parcels, ranging from large-scale networks to local regions, on a mass univariate general linear model (GLM) of connectomes. For each resolution taken independently, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlled the false-discovery rate (FDR) at nominal level on realistic simulations. However, the FDR for tests pooled across all resolutions could be inflated compared to the FDR within resolution. This inflation was severe in the presence of no or weak effects, but became negligible for strong effects. We thus developed an omnibus test to establish the overall presence of true discoveries across all resolutions. Although not a guarantee to control the FDR across resolutions, the omnibus test may be used for descriptive analysis of the impact of resolution on a GLM analysis, in complement to a primary analysis at a predefined single resolution. On three real datasets with significant omnibus test (schizophrenia, congenital blindness, motor practice), markedly higher rate of discovery were obtained at low resolutions, below 50, in line with simulations showing increase in sensitivity at such resolutions. This increase in discovery rate came at the cost of a lower ability to localize effects, as low resolution parcels merged many different brain regions together. However, with 30 or more parcels, the statistical effect maps were biologically plausible and very consistent across resolutions. These results show that resolution is a key parameter for GLM-connectome analysis with FDR control, and that a functional brain parcellation with 30 to 50 parcels may lead to an accurate summary of full connectome effects with good sensitivity in many situations.

A study was undertaken to test different structural models of EFs through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on a large sample of typically developing kindergarteners (N = 272). The method employed sought to remedy the shortcomings of past research in this field such as absence of CFA, insufficient number of EF components tested, insufficient number of indicators per latent variable, and absence of control on processing speed. Children were assessed using a battery of EF tasks developed by the researchers to measure working memory (WM), flexibility, and inhibition (backward word span, backward block span, fruit Stroop, day-night test, hand Stroop, Trails-P, card sort, face sort, and verbal fluency shift). CFA results show the best-fitting model to comprise two factors, namely, an inhibition factor and a WM-flexibility factor. Invariance analyses suggest that this structure is the same for girls and boys and that latent variable means do not differ by sex. These results support the hypothesis of EF differentiation during development. The researchers formulate other hypotheses regarding neurophysiological development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. Methods We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time. Findings Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6.2 years (95% UI 5.6-6.6), from 65.3 years (65.0-65.6) in 1990 to 71.5 years (71.0-71.9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5.4 years (4.9-5.8), from 56.9 years (54.5-59.1) to 62.3 years (59.7-64.8), total DALYs fell by 3.6% (0.3-7.4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people fell by 26.7% (24.6-29.1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. Interpretation Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition-in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden-is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions.	[Murray, Christopher J.

During the last decade, posttranslational modifications have emerged as critical regulators of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Notably, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and palmitoylation control the stability, trafficking, and synaptic expression of glutamate receptors in the central nervous system. In the current review, we will summarize some of the progress made by the neuroscience community regarding our understanding of phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and palmitoylation of the NMDA and AMPA subtypes of glutamate receptors.

In the past years, a plethora of small molecules interfering with amyloid- (A) aggregation has been reported. However, their mode of interaction with amyloid fibers is not understood. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known -secretase modulators; they influence A populations. It has been suggested that NSAIDs are pleiotrophic and can interact with more than one pathomechanism. Here we present a magic angle spinning solid-state NMR study demonstrating that the NSAID sulindac sulfide interacts specifically with Alzheimer disease A fibrils. We find that sulindac sulfide does not induce drastic architectural changes in the fibrillar structure but intercalates between the two -strands of the amyloid fibril and binds to hydrophobic cavities, which are found consistently in all analyzed structures. The characteristic Asp(23)-Lys(28) salt bridge is not affected upon interacting with sulindac sulfide. The primary binding site is located in the vicinity of residue Gly(33), a residue involved in Met(35) oxidation. The results presented here will assist the search for pharmacologically active molecules that can potentially be employed as lead structures to guide the design of small molecules for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.

Parasites obtain folate from the host or synthesize it de novo. Folate consumption has increased in many populations, prompting concerns regarding potential deleterious consequences of higher intake. The impact of high dietary folate on the host's immune function and response to malaria has not been examined. Our goal was to determine whether high dietary folate would affect response to malarial infection in a murine model of cerebral malaria. Mice were fed control diets (CD, recommended folate level for rodents) or folic acid-supplemented diets (FASD, 10x recommended level) for 5 weeks before infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Survival, parasitemia, numbers of immune cells and other infection parameters were assessed. FASD mice had reduced survival (p<0.01, Cox proportional hazards) and higher parasitemia (p<0.01, joint model of parasitemia and survival) compared with CD mice. FASD mice had lower numbers of splenocytes, total T cells, and lower numbers of specific T and NK cell sub-populations, compared with CD mice (p<0.05, linear mixed effects). Increased brain TNF alpha immunoreactive protein (p<0.01, t-test) and increased liver Abca1 mRNA (p<0.01, t-test), a modulator of TNF alpha, were observed in FASD mice; these variables correlated positively (r(s) = 0.63, p = 0.01). Bcl-xl/Bak mRNA was increased in liver of FASD mice (p<0.01, t-test), suggesting reduced apoptotic potential. We conclude that high dietary folate increases parasite replication, disturbs the immune response and reduces resistance to malaria in mice. These findings have relevance for malaria-endemic regions, when considering anti-folate anti-malarials, food fortification or vitamin supplementation programs.

Aged and obese people often report altered pain responses while underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We aim to understand whether spinal microglia could potentially contribute to altered sensory behavior in aged and obese population. Results: In this study, we monitored pain behavior in adult (6 months) and aged (17 months) mice fed with diet containing 10 % or 60 % Kcal fat. The group of young adult (3 months) mice was included as theoretical baseline control. Compared with lean adult animals, diet-induced-obese (DIO) adult, lean and DIO-aged mice showed enhanced painful response to heat and cold stimuli, while exhibiting hyposensitivity to mechanical stimulation. The impact of aging and obesity on microglia properties was evidenced by an increased microglial cell density in the spinal cords, stereotypic morphological changes and polarization towards pro-inflammatory phenotype. Obesity strikingly exacerbated the effect of aging on spinal microglia. Conclusion: Aging/obesity altered microglia properties in the spinal cords, which can dysregulate neuron-microglia crosstalk and impair physiological pain signal transmission. The inflammatory functions of microglia have special relevance for understanding of abnormal pain behavior in aged/obese populations.

Suicidal behaviour results from a complex interplay between stressful events and vulnerability factors, including cognitive deficits. It is not yet clear if memory impairment is part of this specific vulnerability. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the association between memory deficits and vulnerability to suicidal acts. Methods. A literature review was performed using Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo databases. Twenty-four studies (including 2,595 participants) met the selection criteria. Four different types of memory (i.e., working memory, short- and long-term memory, and autobiographical memory) were assessed in at least three different studies. Results. Autobiographical memory was significantly less specific and more general in patients with a history of suicide attempt relative to those without such a history (Hedges' g = 0.8 and 0.9, respectively). Long-term memory and working memory were both more impaired in suicide attempters than in patient and healthy controls. Only short-term memory did not differentiate suicide attempters from patient controls. Conclusions. Memory may play a significant role in the risk of suicidal acts, perhaps by preventing these individuals from using past experiences to solve current problems and to envision the future, and by altering inhibitory processes. More studies are necessary to better clarify these relationships.

The modulation of gamma oscillations is a widely established mechanism in a variety of neurobiological processes, yet its neurochemical basis is not fully understood. Modeling, in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies suggest that gamma oscillation properties depend on GABAergic inhibition. In humans, search for evidence linking total GABA concentration to gamma oscillations has led to promising -but also to partly diverging-observations. Here, we provide the first evidence of a direct relationship between the density of GABA(A) receptors and gamma oscillatory gamma responses in human primary visual cortex (V1). By combining Flumazenil-PET (to measure resting-levels of GABA(A) receptor density) and MEG (to measure visually-induced gamma oscillations), we found that GABA(A) receptor densities correlated positively with the frequency and negatively with amplitude of visually-induced gamma oscillations in V1. Our findings demonstrate that gamma-band response profiles of primary visual cortex across healthy individuals are shaped by GABA(A)-receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission. These results bridge the gap with in-vitro and animal studies and may have future clinical implications given that altered GABAergic function, including dysregulation of GABA(A) receptors, has been related to psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and depression.

Impaired Processing in the Primary Auditory Cortex of an Animal Model of Autism	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						animal model of mental disorders; autism spectrum disorders (ASD); auditory perception; inhibitory neurons; cortical mapping	FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; FETAL VALPROATE SYNDROME; ACID RAT MODEL; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; CRITICAL PERIOD; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; CHILDHOOD AUTISM; VISUAL-CORTEX; HEARING-LOSS; MOUSE MODEL	Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder clinically characterized by deficits in communication, lack of social interaction and repetitive behaviors with restricted interests. A number of studies have reported that sensory perception abnormalities are common in autistic individuals and might contribute to the complex behavioral symptoms of the disorder. In this context, hearing incongruence is particularly prevalent. Considering that some of this abnormal processing might stem from the unbalance of inhibitory and excitatory drives in brain circuitries, we used an animal model of autism induced by valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy in order to investigate the tonotopic organization of the primary auditory cortex (Al) and its local inhibitory circuitry. Our results show that VPA rats have distorted primary auditory maps with over-representation of high frequencies, broadly tuned receptive fields and higher sound intensity thresholds as compared to controls. However, we did not detect differences in the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in Al of VPA and control rats. Altogether our findings show that neurophysiological impairments of hearing perception in this autism model occur independently of alterations in the number of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. These data support the notion that fine circuit alterations, rather than gross cellular modification, could lead to neurophysiological changes in the autistic brain.

Loss of Cellular Sialidases Does Not Affect the Sialylation Status of the Prion Protein but Increases the Amounts of Its Proteolytic Fragment C1	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRUNCATED FORMS; LYSOSOMAL EXOCYTOSIS; CELLS; DIFFERENTIATION; EXPRESSION; SCRAPIE; MICE; CLEAVAGE; BRAIN; IDENTIFICATION	The central molecular event underlying prion diseases involves conformational change of the cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC), which is a sialoglycoprotein, into the disease-associated, transmissible form denoted PrPSc. Recent studies revealed a correlation between the sialylation status of PrPSc and incubation time to disease and introduced a new hypothesis that progression of prion diseases could be controlled or reversed by altering the sialylation level of PrPC. Of the four known mammalian sialidases, the enzymes that cleave off sialic acid residues, only NEU1, NEU3 and NEU4 are expressed in the brain. To test whether cellular sialidases control the steady-state sialylation level of PrPC and to identify the putative sialidase responsible for desialylating PrPC, we analyzed brain-derived PrPC from knockout mice deficient in Neu1, Neu3, Neu4, or from Neu3/Neu4 double knockouts. Surprisingly, no differences in the sialylation of PrPC or its proteolytic product C1 were noticed in any of the knockout mice tested as compared to the age-matched controls. However, significantly higher amounts of the C1 fragment relative to full-length PrPC were detected in the brains of Neu1 knockout mice as compared to WT mice or to the other knockout mice. Additional experiments revealed that in neuroblastoma cell line the sialylation pattern of C1 could be changed by an inhibitor of sialylatransferases. In summary, this study suggests that targeting cellular sialidases is apparently not the correct strategy for altering the sialylation levels of PrPC, whereas modulating the activity of sialylatransferases might offer a more promising approach. Our findings also suggest that catabolism of PrPC involves its a-cleavage followed by desialylation of the resulting C1 fragments by NEU1 and consequent fast degradation of the desialylated products.

While high-dose folic acid supplementation (up to 10 times the daily recommended dose) has been shown to improve sperm parameters in infertile men, the effects of supplementation on the sperm epigenome are unknown. To assess the impact of 6 months of high-dose folic acid supplementation on the sperm epigenome, we studied 30 men with idiopathic infertility. Blood folate concentrations increased significantly after supplementation with no significant improvements in sperm parameters. Methylation levels of the differentially methylated regions of several imprinted loci (H19, DLK1/GTL2, MEST, SNRPN, PLAGL1, KCNQ1OT1) were normal both before and after supplementation. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) revealed a significant global loss of methylation across different regions of the sperm genome. The most marked loss of DNA methylation was found in sperm from patients homozygous for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism, a common polymorphism in a key enzyme required for folate metabolism. RRBS analysis also showed that most of the differentially methylated tiles were located in DNA repeats, low CpG-density and intergenic regions. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that methylation of promoter regions was altered in several genes involved in cancer and neurobehavioral disorders including CBFA2T3, PTPN6, COL18A1, ALDH2, UBE4B, ERBB2, GABRB3, CNTNAP4 and NIPA1. Our data reveal alterations of the human sperm epigenome associated with high-dose folic acid supplementation, effects that were exacerbated by a common polymorphism in MTHFR.

Although transgenic mice overexpressing the mutant vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB) protein with neuron-specific promoters have provided some insight into the toxic properties of the mutant proteins, their role in pathogenesis remains unclear. To identify pathological defects in animals expressing the P56S mutant VAPB protein at physiological levels in the appropriate tissues, we have generated Vapb knock-in mice replacing wild-type Vapb gene with P56S mutant Vapb gene and analyzed the resulting pathological phenotypes. Heterozygous P56S Vapb knock-in mice show mild age-dependent defects in motor behaviors as characteristic features of the disease. The homozygous P56S Vapb knock-in mice show more severe defects compared with heterozygous mice reflecting the dominant and dose-dependent effects of P56S mutation. Significantly, the knock-in mice demonstrate accumulation of P56S VAPB protein and ubiquitinated proteins in cytoplasmic inclusions, selectively in motor neurons. The mutant mice demonstrate induction of ER stress and autophagic response in motor neurons before obvious onset of behavioral defects, suggesting that these cellular biological defects might contribute to the initiation of the disease. The P56S Vapb knock-in mice could be a valuable tool to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which the disease arises.

This includes the oxidation of RNA, which appears to underlie the detrimental effects of oxidative stress, aging and certain neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we investigate the management of oxidized RNA in the chloroplast of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our immunofluorescence microscopy results reveal that oxidized RNA (with 8-hydroxyguanine) is localized in the pyrenoid, a chloroplast microcompartment where CO2 is assimilated by the Calvin cycle enzyme Rubisco. Results of genetic analyses support a requirement for the Rubisco large subunit (RBCL), but not Rubisco, in the management of oxidized RNA. An RBCL pool that can carry out such a 'moonlighting' function is revealed by results of biochemical fractionation experiments. We also show that human (HeLa) cells localize oxidized RNA to cytoplasmic foci that are distinct from stress granules, processing bodies and mitochondria. Our results suggest that the compartmentalization of oxidized RNA management is a general phenomenon and therefore has some fundamental significance.

White and Gray Matter Abnormalities After Cranial Radiation in Children and Mice	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS			English	Article							CHILDHOOD-CANCER SURVIVOR; LONG-TERM SURVIVORS; POSTERIOR-FOSSA TUMORS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; IN-VIVO; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; MOUSE MODEL	Purpose: Pediatric patients treated with cranial radiation are at high risk of developing lasting cognitive impairments. We sought to identify anatomical changes in both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in radiation-treated patients and in mice, in which the effect of radiation can be isolated from other factors, the time course of anatomical change can be established, and the effect of treatment age can be more fully characterized. Anatomical results were compared between species. Methods and Materials: Patients were imaged with T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after radiation treatment. Nineteen radiation-treated patients were divided into groups of 7 years of age and younger (7-) and 8 years and older (8+) and were compared to 41 controls. C57BL6 mice were treated with radiation (n = 52) or sham treated (n = 52) between postnatal days 16 and 36 and then assessed with in vivo and/or ex vivo MRI. In both cases, measurements of WM and GM volume, cortical thickness, area and volume, and hippocampal volume were compared between groups. Results: WM volume was significantly decreased following treatment in 7- and 8+ treatment groups. GM volume was unchanged overall, but cortical thickness was slightly increased in the 7- group. Results in mice mostly mirrored these changes and provided a time course of change, showing early volume loss and normal growth. Hippocampal volume showed a decreasing trend with age in patients, an effect not observed in the mouse hippocampus but present in the olfactory bulb. Conclusions: Changes in mice treated with cranial radiation are similar to those in humans, including significant WM and GM alterations. Because mice did not receive any other treatment, the similarity across species supports the expectation that radiation is causative and suggests mice provide a representative model for studying impaired brain development after cranial radiation and testing novel treatments.

Real diffusion-weighted MRI enabling true signal averaging and increased diffusion contrast	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SIMULTANEOUS MULTISLICE EXCITATION; IN-VIVO VISUALIZATION; MOTION CORRECTION; FIELD-STRENGTH; AXON DIAMETER; HUMAN BRAIN; ECHO; RECONSTRUCTION; ACQUISITIONS; PARAMETERS	This project aims to characterize the impact of underlying noise distributions on diffusion-weighted imaging. The noise floor is a well-known problem for traditional magnitude-based diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data, leading to biased diffusion model fits and inaccurate signal averaging. Here, we introduce a total-variation-based algorithm to eliminate shot-to-shot phase variations of complex-valued diffusion data with the intention to extract real-valued dMRI datasets. The obtained real-valued diffusion data are no longer superimposed by a noise floor but instead by a zero-mean Gaussian noise distribution, yielding dMRI data without signal bias. We acquired high-resolution dMRI data with strong diffusion weighting and, thus, low signal-to-noise ratio. Both the extracted real-valued and traditional magnitude data were compared regarding signal averaging, diffusion model fitting and accuracy in resolving crossing fibers. Our results clearly indicate that real-valued diffusion data enables idealized conditions for signal averaging. Furthermore, the proposed method enables unbiased use of widely employed linear least squares estimators for model fitting and demonstrates an increased sensitivity to detect secondary fiber directions with reduced angular error. The use of phase-corrected, real-valued data for dMRI will therefore help to clear the way for more detailed and accurate studies of white matter microstructure and structural connectivity on a fine scale.

Single-dose serotonergic stimulation shows widespread effects on functional brain connectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						FMRI; Functional connectivity; Neuropharmacology; Resting state networks; SSRI; Serotonin	RESTING-STATE FMRI; ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG-ACTION; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY PET; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CINGULATE CORTEX; REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	The serotonergic system is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system. It is well known as a mood regulating system, although it also contributes to many other functions. With resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) it is possible to investigate whole brain functional connectivity. We used this non-invasive neuroimaging technique to measure acute pharmacological effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline (75 mg) in 12 healthy volunteers. In this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, RS-fMRI scans were repeatedly acquired during both visits (at baseline and 3, 5, 7 and 9 h after administering sertraline or placebo). Within-group comparisons of voxelwise functional connectivity with ten functional networks were examined (p < 0.005, corrected) using a mixed effects model with cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, motion parameters, heart rate and respiration as covariates. Sertraline induced widespread effects on functional connectivity with multiple networks; the default mode network, the executive control network, visual networks, the sensorimotor network and the auditory network. A common factor among these networks was the involvement of the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Cognitive and subjective measures were taken as well, but yielded no significant treatment effects, emphasizing the sensitivity of RS-fMRI to pharmacological challenges. The results are consistent with the existence of an extensive serotonergic system relating to multiple brain functions with a possible key role for the precuneus and cingulate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The current study investigated if DTMS delivered with H-coils has acute antidepressant effects in major depression using a systematic literature review and a quantitative meta analysis Methods: Seventeen studies on 'DTMS or H-coil' and 'depression' were identified on Medline, Psyclnfo, and Google Scholar (until November 2014). Data from nine open label studies were meta-analysed using a random-effects model with inverse-variance weights. The outcome measures were the standardised paired mean difference (Cohen's d) in depression scores on Hamilton Depression Raring Scale (HDRS), response, remission, and dropout: rates after acute DTMS treatment compared to baseline. Results: There was a large antidepressant effect after 20 acute, high-frequency DTMS sessions compared to baseline according to HDRS change scores (overall mean weighted d=2.04, 95% confidence interval: 1.53-2.55; nine studies; 150 patients). Overall weighted response, remission, and dropout rates were 60%, 29%, and 18% respectively. HDRS change scores and response rates fended to be higher in four studies with 68 patients on concurrent antidepressants compared to two studies with 26 patients who received DTMS as a monotherapy. Limitations: These results are based on data from a low number of open-label studies. Conclusion: High-frequency DTMS appears to have acute antidepressant effects after 20 sessions in mostly unipolar and treatment-resistant patients. Concurrent treatment with antidepressants might enhance the efficacy of DTMS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

The aim of this study was to document the effects of neonatal low-protein diet on masticatory efficiency. Newborn rats whose mothers were fed 17 % (nourished (N), n 60) or 8% (undernourished (U), n 56) protein were compared. Their weight was monitored and their masticatory jaw movements were video-recorded. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in brainstem slice preparations to investigate the intrinsic membrane properties and N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced bursting characteristics of the rhythmogenic neurons (N, n 43; U, n 39) within the trigeminal main sensory nucleus (NVsnpr). Morphometric analysis (N, n 4; U, n 5) were conducted on masseteric muscles serial cross-sections. Our results showed that undernourished animals had lower numbers of masticatory sequences (P=0.049) and cycles (P=0.045) and slower chewing frequencies (P=0.004) (N, n 32; U, n 28). Undernutrition reduced body weight but had little effect on many basic NVsnpr neuronal electrophysiological parameters. It did, however, affect sag potentials (P<0.001) and rebound firing (P=0.005) that influence firing pattern. Undernutrition delayed the appearance of bursting and reduced the propensity to burst (P=0.002), as well as the bursting frequency (P=0.032). Undernourished animals showed increased and reduced proportions of fibre type IIA (P<0.0001) and IIB (P<0.0001), respectively. In addition, their fibre areas (IIA, P<0.001; IIB, P<0.001) and perimeters (IIA, P<0.001; IIB, P<0.001) were smaller. The changes observed at the behavioural, neuronal and muscular levels suggest that undernutrition reduces chewing efficiency by slowing, weakening and delaying maturation of the masticatory muscles and the associated neuronal circuitry.

Quantifying cognition at the bedside: a novel approach combining cognitive symptoms and signs in HIV	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						HIV; Cognitive impairment; Cognitive testing; HAND; Rasch analysis; Practice effect	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; FORMER PLASMA DONORS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS; RASCH ANALYSIS; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; DEPRESSION SCALE; HOSPITAL ANXIETY; SCREENING TOOL; INFECTION	Background: Up to half of all people with HIV infection have some degree of cognitive impairment. This impairment is typically mild, but nonetheless often disabling. Although early detection of cognitive impairment offers the greatest hope of effective intervention, there are important barriers to this goal in most clinical settings. These include uncertainty about how self-reported cognitive symptoms relate to objective impairments, and the paucity of bedside measurement tools suitable for mild deficits. Clinicians need guidance in interpreting cognitive symptoms in this population, and a brief cognitive measurement tool targeted to mild impairment. We addressed these two problems together here. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which performance on cognitive tests and self-reported cognitive symptoms form a unidimensional construct. Methods: Two hundred three HIV+ individuals completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, computerized cognitive tasks and a questionnaire eliciting cognitive symptoms. Rasch measurement theory was applied to determine whether patient-reported and performance items could be combined to measure cognition as a unidimensional latent construct. Results: Performance-based items and cognitive symptoms are arranged hierarchically along the same continuum of cognitive ability, forming a measure with thresholds covering a broad spectrum of ability that has good internal reliability. The cognitive symptoms that fit the measurement model relate to important aspects of everyday life, providing evidence that the identified construct is meaningful. Conclusions: This finding lays the foundation for a rapid measure of cognitive ability in people with HIV infection that is feasible for routine clinical use, and shows that some cognitive symptoms are systematically related to performance in this population.

DEVELOPMENTAL EXPRESSION AND FUNCTION ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE RECEPTOR TYPE IN OLIGODENDROCYTE MYELINATION	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						axonal myelination; spinal cord; cuprizone; corpus callosum	CELL-ADHESION MOLECULE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; GROWTH CONES; ADULT-RAT; CNS; DELTA; MICE; DIFFERENTIATION; NKX2.2	Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are extensively expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), and have distinct spatial and temporal patterns in different cell types during development. Previous studies have demonstrated possible roles for RPTPs in axon outgrowth, guidance, and synaptogenesis. In the present study, our results revealed that protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type D (PTPRD) was initially expressed in mature neurons in embryonic CNS, and later in oligodendroglial cells at postnatal stages when oligodendrocytes undergo active axonal myelination process. In PTPRD mutants, oligodendrocyte differentiation was normal and a transient myelination delay occurred at early postnatal stages, indicating the contribution of PTPRD to the initiation of axonal myelination. Our results also showed that the remyelination process was not affected in the absence of PTPRD function after a cuprizone-induced demyelination in adult animals.

Genome-wide analysis implicates microRNAs and their target genes in the development of bipolar disorder	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							HOST GENES; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; RISK LOCI; ASSOCIATION; IDENTIFICATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BIOGENESIS; BRAIN; TRANSCRIPTOME	Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe and highly heritable neuropsychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 1%. Molecular genetic studies have identified the first BD susceptibility genes. However, the disease pathways remain largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs, a class of small noncoding RNAs, contribute to basic mechanisms underlying brain development and plasticity, suggesting their possible involvement in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders, including BD. In the present study, gene-based analyses were performed for all known autosomal microRNAs using the largest genome-wide association data set of BD to date (9747 patients and 14 278 controls). Associated and brain-expressed microRNAs were then investigated in target gene and pathway analyses. Functional analyses of miR-499 and miR-708 were performed in rat hippocampal neurons. Ninety-eight of the six hundred nine investigated microRNAs showed nominally significant P-values, suggesting that BD-associated microRNAs might be enriched within known microRNA loci. After correction for multiple testing, nine microRNAs showed a significant association with BD. The most promising were miR-499, miR-708 and miR-1908. Target gene and pathway analyses revealed 18 significant canonical pathways, including brain development and neuron projection. For miR-499, four Bonferroni-corrected significant target genes were identified, including the genome-wide risk gene for psychiatric disorder CACNB2. First results of functional analyses in rat hippocampal neurons neither revealed nor excluded a major contribution of miR-499 or miR-708 to dendritic spine morphogenesis. The present results suggest that research is warranted to elucidate the precise involvement of microRNAs and their downstream pathways in BD.	[Forstner, A. J.; Hofmann, A.; Maaser, A.; Muehleisen, T.

Although loss of inhibitory tone in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord is a major contributor to neuropathic pain, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this disinhibition are unclear. Here, we combined pharmacogenetic activation and selective ablation approaches in mice to define the contribution of spinal cord parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons in naive and neuropathic pain conditions. Ablating PV neurons in naive mice produce neuropathic pain-like mechanical allodynia via disinhibition of PKC gamma excitatory interneurons. Conversely, activating PV neurons in nerve-injured mice alleviates mechanical hypersensitivity. These findings indicate that PV interneurons are modality-specific filters that gate mechanical but not thermal inputs to the dorsal horn and that increasing PV interneuron activity can ameliorate the mechanical hypersensitivity that develops following nerve injury.

Ann			Lower physical activity is associated with higher disease burden in pediatric multiple sclerosis	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; STUDIES DEPRESSION SCALE; AEROBIC FITNESS; PREADOLESCENT CHILDREN; FATIGUE; METAANALYSIS; CHILDHOOD; PERFORMANCE; VOLUME; ONSET	Objective:To evaluate the association between physical activity (PA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity, depression, and fatigue in a cohort of children with MS and monophasic acquired demyelinating syndrome (mono-ADS). Methods:In this cross-sectional study of consecutive patients attending a specialized pediatric MS clinic, we administered the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Quantitative MRI analysis was performed to obtain whole brain and T2 lesion volume in a subset of participants (n = 60). Results:A total of 110 patients (79 mono-ADS; 31 MS; 5-18 years; M:F 1:1.2) were included. Patients with MS reported less strenuous (33.21 31.88 metabolic equivalents [METs] vs 15.97 +/- 22.73 METs, p = 0.002) and total (44.48 +/- 39.35 METs vs 67.28 +/- 59.65 METs; p = 0.0291) PA than those with mono-ADS. Patients with MS who reported greater amounts of moderate PA METs had fewer sleep/rest fatigue symptoms (r = -0.4). Participation in strenuous PA was associated with smaller T2 lesion volumes (r = -0.66) and lower annualized relapse rate (r = -0.66). No associations were found between total brain volume and participation in PA. Conclusions:Children with MS are less physically active than children with mono-ADS. Reasons for this are unclear, but may be related to ongoing disease activity, perceived limitations, or symptoms such as depression or fatigue. Children with MS reporting higher levels of strenuous PA had lower T2 lesion volumes and lower relapse rates, suggesting a potential protective effect of strenuous PA in this population. Further longitudinal studies are needed to establish the relationship of PA to MS symptoms and disease activity in this population.	[Grover, Stephanie A.; Yeh, E.

Close connections exist between music and mathematics since both pursue harmony and unity. In music, the consonance of notes played simultaneously partly determines our perception of harmony; associates with aesthetic responses; and influences the emotion expression. The consonance could be considered as a window to understand and analyze harmony. Here for the first time we used a 1/f fluctuation analysis to investigate whether the consonance fluctuation structure in music with a wide range of composers and genres followed the scale free pattern that has been found for pitch, melody, rhythm, human body movements, brain activity, natural images and geographical features. We then used a network graph approach to investigate which composers were the most influential both within and across genres. Our results showed that patterns of consonance in music did follow scale-free characteristics, suggesting that this feature is a universally evolved one in both music and the living world. Furthermore, our network analysis revealed that Bach's harmony patterns were having the most influence on those used by other composers, followed closely by Mozart.

The following possibilities have been suggested: loss of foveal cells, reduced cortical magnification, loss of spatial resolution of foveal cells, and topographical disarray in the cellular map. To resolve this we undertook a population receptive field (pRF) functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis in the central field in humans with moderate-to-severe amblyopia. We measured the relationship between averaged pRF size and retinal eccentricity in retinotopic visual areas. Results showed that cortical magnification is normal in the foveal field of strabismic amblyopes. However, the pRF sizes are enlarged for the amblyopic eye. We speculate that the pRF enlargement reflects loss of cellular resolution or an increased cellular positional disarray within the representation of the amblyopic eye.

To determine whether grid cell activity reflects distance traveled or elapsed time independent of external information, we recorded grid cells as animals ran in place on a treadmill. Grid cell activity was only weakly influenced by location, but most grid cells and other neurons recorded from the same electrodes strongly signaled a combination of distance and time, with some signaling only distance or time. Grid cells were more sharply tuned to time and distance than non-grid cells. Many grid cells exhibited multiple firing fields during treadmill running, parallel to the periodic firing fields observed in open fields, suggesting a common mode of information processing. These observations indicate that, in the absence of external dynamic cues, grid cells integrate self-generated distance and time information to encode a representation of experience.

Furthermore, curative attempts to treat ruptured AVM patients have not been questioned so far, and there is a lack of prospective data on clinical results according to treatment modality. Endovascular treatment is often used aiming to improve the safety or efficacy of surgery or radiation therapy, but benefits have never been documented in a trial. A care trial context is needed to evaluate interventions at the same time they are practised. Methods/Trial design: TOBAS is a pragmatic, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial and registry which offers a care trial context for brain AVM patients, including surgical resection, radiosurgery or endovascular embolization, alone or combined. The study includes two RCTs and a multimodality prospective registry. The objectives of the proposed study are to assess whether preventive interventions (surgery, embolization, radiation therapy, alone or combined), selected by the local treatment team and performed as locally practiced, randomly allocated and compared with conservative management, in unruptured brain AVM patients eligible for active or conservative management, can improve the proportion of patients having an independent outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) < 3, as assessed by a standardized questionnaire administered by non-masked care personnel) at 10 years. All patients judged ineligible for randomized allocation are to be entered in a multimodal registry. The objective of a nested trial in patients with ruptured or unruptured AVMs to be treated by surgery or radiation therapy, is to assess whether pre surgical or pre radiation embolization, randomly allocated and compared with no embolization, can improve the proportion of patients with complete eradication of the AVM, as locally adjudicated, combined with a good clinical outcome (mRS < 3). The study will require up to 2000 patients in approximately 30 centers or more, followed for 10 years.

We conducted a study to develop and validate a clinical decision rule to identify skull fracture in young children with head trauma and no immediate need for head tomography. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study in 3 tertiary care emergency departments in the province of Quebec. Participants were children less than 2 years old who had a head trauma and were not at high risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 15, altered level of consciousness or palpable skull fracture). The primary outcome was skull fracture. For each participant, the treating physician completed a standardized report form after physical examination and before radiologic evaluation. The decision to order skull radiography was at the physician's discretion. The clinical decision rule was derived using recursive partitioning. Results: A total of 811 patients (49 with skull fracture) were recruited during the derivation phase. The 2 predictors identified through recursive partitioning were parietal or occipital swelling or hematoma and age less than 2 months. The rule had a sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 83%-99%) and a specificity of 86% (95% CI 84%-89%) in the derivation phase. During the validation phase, 856 participants (44 with skull fracture) were recruited. The rule had a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 87% during this phase. Interpretation: The clinical decision rule developed in this study identified about 90% of skull fractures among young children with mild head trauma who had no immediate indication for head tomography. Use of the rule would have reduced the number of radiologic evaluations by about 60%.

Evidence of chronic stress-induced dendritic and spine atrophy among PFC pyramidal neurons led us to examine how chronic restraint stress (CRS) might alter the apical dendritic morphology of callosal neurons and the acute GLU stress responses in the left versus right PFC. Morphometric analyses of retrogradely labeled, dye-filled PFC callosal neurons revealed hemisphere-specific CRS-induced dendritic retraction; whereas significant dendritic atrophy occurred primarily within the distal arbor of left PFC neurons, it was observed within both the proximal and distal arbor of right PFC neurons. Overall, CRS also significantly reduced spine densities in both hemispheres with the greatest loss occurring among left PFC neurons, mostly at the distal extent of the arbor. While much of the overall decrease in dendritic spine density was accounted by the loss of thin spines, the density of mushroom-shaped spines, despite being fewer in number, was halved. Using microdialysis we found that, compared to controls, basal PFC GLU levels were significantly reduced in both hemispheres of CRS animals and that their GLU response to 30min of tail-pinch stress was significantly prolonged in the left, but not the right PFC. Together, these findings show that a history of chronic stress alters the dendritic morphology and spine density of PFC callosal neurons and suggest a mechanism by which this might disrupt the interhemispheric regulation of PFC-mediated responses to subsequent stressors.

Methods: Chart and literature reviews were performed. Results: The reported patient had delayed onset spinal drop metastasis that was only detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A 48-year-old patient had supratentorial glioblastoma, treated with radiotherapy (RT) and concurrent temozolomide followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Four years after completion of all treatments (62 months from initial presentation), he developed low backache and weakness in both legs. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans demonstrated intracranial recurrence only. Spinal drop metastases were detected only by MRI scan. Local spinal RT 40 Gy in 20 fractions with concurrent and maintenance temozolomide were given. Because of disease progression after nine cycles of temozolomide, systemic therapy was changed to bevacizumab, which greatly improved his symptoms for 4 months before deterioration of mental status. He is still alive with disease at 22 months after diagnosis of spinal metastases (84 months from initial glioblastoma diagnosis). Conclusions: MRI is the diagnostic imaging of choice for spinal metastases. This illustrative case of delayed-onset spinal metastases shows unusual slow progression. Local RT, temozolomide, and targeted therapy may improve survival. This illustrative case is the first report of bevacizumab as a second-line therapy in drop metastasis of glioblastoma.

Methods: All articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, HealthStar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to November 2014), and gray literature were searched. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodologies by two independent reviewers. Results: Overall, 20 original studies were identified, with 19 manuscripts and one meeting abstract. Two hundred and thirty-five pediatric patients were treated for 252 episodes of SE/RSE. Patients had varying numbers of antiepileptic drugs (two to eight) on board before lidocaine therapy. During 20 of the 252 (7.9%) episodes of SE/RSE, phenytoin was on board. The dose regimen of lidocaine varied, with some using bolus dosing alone; others used a combination of bolus and infusion therapy. Overall, 60.0% of seizures responded to lidocaine, with complete cessation and greater than 50% reduction seen in 57.6% and 12.3%, respectively. Patient outcomes were sparingly reported. Conclusions: There currently exists Oxford level 2b, Grading of Recommendations Assessment Developement, and Evaluation C evidence to support the consideration of lidocaine for SE and RSE in the pediatric population. Further prospective studies of lidocaine administration in this setting are warranted.

Approximately, half of all patients are associated with known mutations in more than 200 disease genes. Most retinal degenerations are restricted to the retina (primary retinal degeneration) but photoreceptor degeneration can also be found in a wide variety of systemic and syndromic diseases. These are called secondary retinal degenerations. We review several well-known systemic diseases with retinal degenerations (RD). We discuss RD with hearing loss, RD with brain disease, and RD with musculoskeletal disease. We then postulate which retinal degenerations may also have previously undetected systemic features. Emerging new and exciting evidence is showing that ubiquitously expressed genes associated with multitissue syndromic disorders may also harbor mutations that cause isolated primary retinal degeneration. Examples are RPGR, CEP290, CLN3, MFSD5, and HK1 mutations that cause a wide variety of primary retinal degenerations with intact systems.

Islet Neogenesis Associated Protein (INGAP) was discovered in the partially duct-obstructed hamster pancreas. Its bioactive fragment, pentadecapeptide 104-118 (INGAP-P), has been shown to reverse diabetes in animal models and to improve glucose homeostasis in patients with diabetes in clinical trials. Further development of INGAP as a therapy for diabetes requires identification of target cells in the pancreas and characterization of the mechanisms of action. We hypothesized that adult human pancreatic ductal cells retain morphogenetic plasticity and can be induced by INGAP to undergo endocrine differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we treated the normal human pancreatic ductal cell line (HPDE) with either INGAP-P or full-length recombinant protein (rINGAP) for short-term periods. Our data show that this single drug treatment induces both proliferation and transdifferentiation of HPDE cells, the latter being characterized by the rapid sequential activation of endocrine developmental transcription factors Pdx-1, Ngn3, NeuroD, IA-1, and MafA and subsequently the expression of insulin at both the mRNA and the protein levels. After 7 days, C-peptide was detected in the supernatant of INGAP-treated cells, reflecting their ability to secrete insulin. The magnitude of differentiation was enhanced by embedding the cells in Matrigel, which led to islet-like cluster formation. The islet-like clusters cells stained positive for nuclear Pdx-1 and Glut 2 proteins, and were expressing Insulin mRNA. These new data suggest that human adult pancreatic ductal cells retain morphogenetic plasticity and demonstrate that a short exposure to INGAP triggers their differentiation into insulin-expressing cells in vitro. In the context of the urgent search for a regenerative and/or cellular therapy for diabetes, these results make INGAP a promising therapeutic candidate.

Mallar			High-resolution In Vivo Manual Segmentation Protocol for Human Hippocampal Subfields Using 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 105; Structural magnetic resonance imaging; High resolution; Neuroanatomy; Hippocampus; Hippocampal subfields; Manual segmentation; Atlas	AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED TEMPLATES; MRI; ATLAS; REGISTRATION; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY; SPECIMENS; HISTOLOGY; AMYGDALA; SPACE	The human hippocampus has been broadly studied in the context of memory and normal brain function and its role in different neuropsychiatric disorders has been heavily studied. While many imaging studies treat the hippocampus as a single unitary neuroanatomical structure, it is, in fact, composed of several subfields that have a complex three-dimensional geometry. As such, it is known that these subfields perform specialized functions and are differentially affected through the course of different disease states. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can be used as a powerful tool to interrogate the morphology of the hippocampus and its subfields. Many groups use advanced imaging software and hardware (>3T) to image the subfields; however this type of technology may not be readily available in most research and clinical imaging centers. To address this need, this manuscript provides a detailed step-by-step protocol for segmenting the full anterior-posterior length of the hippocampus and its subfields: cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus (DG), strata radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare (SR/SL/SM), and subiculum. This protocol has been applied to five subjects (3F, 2M; age 29-57, avg. 37). Protocol reliability is assessed by resegmenting either the right or left hippocampus of each subject and computing the overlap using the Dice's kappa metric. Mean Dice's kappa (range) across the five subjects are: whole hippocampus, 0.91 (0.90-0.92); CA1, 0.78 (0.77-0.79); CA2/CA3, 0.64 (0.56-0.73); CA4/dentate gyrus, 0.83 (0.81-0.85); strata radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare, 0.71 (0.68-0.73); and subiculum 0.75 (0.72-0.78). The segmentation protocol presented here provides other laboratories with a reliable method to study the hippocampus and hippocampal subfields in vivo using commonly available MR tools.

The first part of the White Paper reviews, comments, and, in some cases, expands on the 4 session areas critical to new drug development: pharmacological challenges, recent drug approaches, drug targets and discovery, and clinical paths. Following this concise review of the science and clinical aspects of new CNS anticancer drug discovery and development, we discuss, under the rubric "Accelerating Drug Discovery and Development for Brain Tumors," further reasons why the pharmaceutical industry and academia have failed to develop new anticancer drugs for CNS malignancies and what it will take to change the current status quo and develop the drugs so desperately needed by our patients with malignant CNS tumors. While this White Paper is not a formal roadmap to that end, it should be an educational guide to clinicians and scientists to help move a stagnant field forward.

Cleavage of a Neuroinvasive Human Respiratory Virus Spike Glycoprotein by Proprotein Convertases Modulates Neurovirulence and Virus Spread within the Central Nervous System	PLOS PATHOGENS			English	Article							HUMAN CORONAVIRUS OC43; MOUSE HEPATITIS-VIRUS; TO-CELL FUSION; MURINE CORONAVIRUS; PROTEOLYTIC CLEAVAGE; BOVINE CORONAVIRUSES; PERSISTENT INFECTION; PROTEIN CLEAVAGE; FURIN CLEAVAGE; BALB/C MICE	Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are respiratory pathogens that may be associated with the development of neurological diseases, in view of their neuroinvasive and neurotropic properties. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein is a major virulence factor for several coronavirus species, including the OC43 strain of HCoV (HCoV-OC43). In an attempt to study the role of this protein in virus spread within the central nervous system (CNS) and neurovirulence, as well as to identify amino acid residues important for such functions, we compared the sequence of the S gene found in the laboratory reference strain HCoV-OC43 ATCC VR-759 to S sequences of viruses detected in clinical isolates from the human respiratory tract. We identified one predominant mutation at amino acid 758 (from RRSR down arrow(G) under bar 758 to RRSR down arrow(R) under bar 758), which introduces a putative furin-like cleavage (down arrow) site. Using a molecular cDNA infectious clone to generate a corresponding recombinant virus, we show for the first time that such point mutation in the HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein creates a functional cleavage site between the S1 and S2 portions of the S protein. While the corresponding recombinant virus retained its neuroinvasive properties, this mutation led to decreased neurovirulence while potentially modifying the mode of virus spread, likely leading to a limited dissemination within the CNS. Taken together, these results are consistent with the adaptation of HCoV-OC43 to the CNS environment, resulting from the selection of quasi-species harboring mutations that lead to amino acid changes in viral genes, like the S gene in HCoV-OC43, which may contribute to a more efficient establishment of a less pathogenic but persistent CNS infection. This adaptative mechanism could potentially be associated with human encephalitis or other neurological degenerative pathologies.

Design: Randomized, blinded, and sham-controlled study. Setting: Neurologic rehabilitation hospital. Participants: Participants (N = 30) with subacute aphasia after stroke. Interventions: During a 2-week treatment period, half of the participants received 10 sessions of 20-minute inhibitory 1-Hz rTMS over the right inferior frontal gyms (Brodmann area 45), and the other half received sham stimulation. Directly thereafter, all the participants underwent 45 minutes of speech and language therapy. Main Outcome Measures: Aachen Aphasia Test, Amsterdam-Nijmegen Everyday Language Test (ANELT), a naming screening, and subscales of the FIM, all assessed the day before and the day after treatment period. Results: The participants who received real rTMS significantly improved with respect to all 10 measures of basic linguistic skills and functional communication, whereas sham-treated participants significantly improved in only 6 of 10 measures (paired t tests, P<.05). There was a significant difference in the gains made by the 2 groups on 5 of 10 measures including functional communication (ANELT) (repeated-measures analysis of variance, P<.05). Conclusions: For the first time, this study has demonstrated that basic linguistic skills as well as functional communication are bolstered by combining rTMS and behavioral language therapy in patients with subacute aphasia.

The interplay of birth weight, dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4), and early maternal care in the prediction of disorganized attachment at 36 months of age	DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER PROMOTER; INFANT-MOTHER ATTACHMENT; ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION; BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; ADULT MOTHERS; RISK-FACTORS; SCHOOL-AGE; SENSITIVITY; CHILDREN	Disorganized attachment is an important early risk factor for socioemotional problems throughout childhood and into adulthood. Prevailing models of the etiology of disorganized attachment emphasize the role of highly dysfunctional parenting, to the exclusion of complex models examining the interplay of child and parental factors. Decades of research have established that extreme child birth weight may have long-term effects on developmental processes. These effects are typically negative, but this is not always the case. Recent studies have also identified the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) as a moderator of childrearing effects on the development of disorganized attachment. However, there are inconsistent findings concerning which variant of the polymorphism (seven-repeat long-form allele or non-seven-repeat short-form allele) is most likely to interact with caregiving in predicting disorganized versus organized attachment. In this study, we examined possible two-and three-way interactions and child DRD4 polymorphisms and birth weight and maternal caregiving at age 6 months in longitudinally predicting attachment disorganization at 36 months. Our sample is from the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment project, a sample of 650 mother-child dyads. Birth weight was cross-referenced with normative data to calculate birth weight percentile. Infant DRD4 was obtained with buccal swabs and categorized according to the presence of the putative allele seven repeat. Macroanalytic and microanalytic measures of maternal behavior were extracted from a videotaped session of 20 min of nonfeeding interaction followed by a 10-min divided attention maternal task at 6 months. Attachment was assessed at 36 months using the Strange Situation procedure, and categorized into disorganized attachment and others. The results indicated that a main effect for DRD4 and a two-way interaction of birth weight and 6-month maternal attention (frequency of maternal looking away behavior) and sensitivity predicted disorganized attachment in robust logistic regression models adjusted for social demographic covariates. Specifically, children in the midrange of birthweightwere more likely to develop a disorganized attachment when exposed to less attentive maternal care. However, the association reversed with extreme birth weight (low and high). The DRD4 seven-repeat allele was associated with less disorganized attachment (protective), while non-seven-repeat children were more likely to be classified as disorganized attachment. The implications for understanding inconsistencies in the literature about which DRD4 genotype is the risk direction are also considered. Suggestions for intervention with families with infants at different levels of biological risk and caregiving risk are also discussed.

Symptoms of major depressive disorder subsequent to child maltreatment: Examining change across multiple levels of analysis to identify transdiagnostic risk pathways	DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE; COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR-THERAPY; EMOTION REGULATION; MENTAL-DISORDERS; NEGATIVE AFFECT; SEXUAL-ABUSE; NEUROENDOCRINE ACTIVITY; ADULT PSYCHOPATHOLOGY	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition in the child maltreatment population. However, not all children who have been maltreated will develop MDD or MDD symptoms, suggesting the presence of unique risk pathways that explain how certain children develop MDD symptoms when others do not. The current study tested several candidate risk pathways to MDD symptoms following child maltreatment: neuroendocrine, autonomic, affective, and emotion regulation. Female adolescents (N = 110; age range = 14-19) were recruited into a substantiated child maltreatment or comparison condition and completed a laboratory stressor, saliva samples, and measures of emotion regulation, negative affect, and MDD symptoms. MDD symptoms were reassessed 18 months later. Mediational modeling revealed that emotion regulation was the only significant indirect effect of the relationship between child maltreatment and subsequent MDD symptoms, demonstrating that children exposed to maltreatment had greater difficulties managing affective states that in turn led to more severe MDD symptoms. These results highlight the importance of emotion dysregulation as a central risk pathway to MDD following child maltreatment. Areas of future research and implications for optimizing prevention and clinical intervention through the direct targeting of transdiagnostic risk pathways are discussed.

Ventral striatal gamma oscillations are highly variable from trial to trial, and are dominated by behavioural state, and only weakly influenced by outcome value	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						local field potential; nucleus accumbens; phase-amplitude coupling; striatum; value	HUMAN NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; REWARD-SEEKING BEHAVIOR; FREELY MOVING RATS; DECISION-MAKING; NEURONS ENCODE; FREQUENCY; DOPAMINE; MOTIVATION; ADDICTION; CIRCUITS	The human and rodent ventral striatal local field potentials show striking oscillations in the gamma band (similar to 40-100 Hz), which have been linked to aspects of behaviour such as reward anticipation and delivery, movement initiation, learning from feedback, and decision-making. These oscillations show a rich temporal organization, whose relationship with behavioural variables is not well understood. Here, we show that, in rats performing a conditioned approach task, low-gamma and high-gamma oscillations during an immobile reward anticipation epoch were largely insensitive to outcome value, even though rats distinguished behaviourally between different outcomes, and single units encoded outcome value. Behaviour was highly stereotyped, yet we observed large variability from trial to trial in the occurrence and timing of these oscillations. Furthermore, higher-order features such as high-gamma power leading low-gamma power, and phase-amplitude coupling to lower-frequency bands, were only marginally modulated by outcome value. Moreover, these patterns closely resembled those found during off-task rest periods in which no rewards could be earned. These observations suggest a new interpretation of ventral striatal gamma oscillations as reflecting a default or resting state, with only minor and highly variable modulation by specific task-related variables.

Outcomes of preterm infants following the introduction of room air resuscitation	RESUSCITATION			English	Article						Oxygen; Infant; Premature; Resuscitation; Neonatal intensive care	100-PERCENT OXYGEN; INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; DEPRESSED NEWBORN; OXIDATIVE STRESS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; METAANALYSIS; PREMATURITY; RETINOPATHY	Background: After 2006 most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Canada stopped initiating newborn resuscitation with 100% oxygen. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we compared neonatal outcomes in infants born at <= 27 weeks gestation that received <100% oxygen (OXtitrate group, typically 21-40% oxygen) during delivery room resuscitation to infants that received 100% oxygen (OX100 group). Results: Data from 17 NICUs included 2326 infants, 1244 in the OXtitrate group and 1082 in the OX100 group. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for the primary outcome of severe neurologic injury or death was higher in the OXtitrate group compared with the OX100 group (AOR 1.36; 95% CI 1.11, 1.66). A similar increase was also noted when comparing infants initially resuscitated with room air to the OX100 group (AOR 1.33; 95% CI 1.04, 1.69). Infants in the OXtitrate group were less likely to have received either medical or surgical treatment for a patent ductus arteriosus (AOR 0.53; 95% CI 0.37, 0.74). Conclusions: In Canadian NICUs, we observed a higher risk of severe neurologic injury or death among preterm infants of <= 27 weeks gestation following a change in practice to initiating resuscitation with either room air or an intermediate oxygen concentration.

Using in vitro, ex vivo and postmortem human materials, we identified a significant upregulation of junctional adhesion molecule-like expression at the blood-brain barrier, monocytes, and CD8 T cells of multiple sclerosis patients. We also detected junctional adhesion molecule-like(+) trans-migratory cups when monocytes/CD8 T cells adhered to the blood-brain barrier, however, their migratory capacity was significantly compromised when junctional adhesion molecule-like was blocked. These findings highlight a novel role for junctional adhesion molecule-like in leukocyte transmigration and its potential as a promising therapeutic target.

Phosphene thresholds, the minimum stimulation intensity required to reliably produce phosphenes, are widely used as an index of cortical excitability. However, the neural basis of phosphene thresholds and their relationship to individual differences in visual cognition are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the neurochemical basis of phosphene perception by measuring basal GABA and glutamate levels in primary visual cortex using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We further examined whether phosphene thresholds would relate to the visuospatial phenomenology of grapheme-color synesthesia, a condition characterized by atypical binding and involuntary color photisms. Phosphene thresholds negatively correlated with glutamate concentrations in visual cortex, with lower thresholds associated with elevated glutamate. This relationship was robust, present in both controls and synesthetes, and exhibited neurochemical, topographic, and threshold specificity. Projector synesthetes, who experience color photisms as spatially colocalized with inducing graphemes, displayed lower phosphene thresholds than associator synesthetes, who experience photisms as internal images, with both exhibiting lower thresholds than controls. These results suggest that phosphene perception is driven by interindividual variation in glutamatergic activity in primary visual cortex and relates to cortical processes underlying individual differences in visuospatial awareness.

There is growing evidence of environmental contamination and exposures to both humans and wildlife. Here, the objective was to increase understanding of the potential neurodevelopmental effects of two relevant OPFRs, TMPP (tri (methylphenyl) phosphate; a non-halogen-containing OPFR) and TDCIPP (tris (1,3-dichloro-isopropyl) phosphate; a halogen-containing OPFR) in an avian embryo/chick model. We injected white leghom chicken eggs with a range of TMPP (0, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/g) or TDCIPP (0, 10, 100, 1000, 50,000 ng/g) concentrations at incubation day 0 exposing embryos throughout the similar to 21-day in ovo period. Hatching success was unaffected by TMPP, but TDCIPP-exposed chicks had higher early-incubation mortality in 100 and 50,000 ng/g groups. On 7-9-dayr-old chicks, we assessed behavior via tests concerning righting reflex, angled balance beams, gait patterns, wing flap reflex, and open field movements. Chicks exposed to 100 ng/g TDCIPP achieved 40% lower maximum velocity in the open field test than vehicle-exposed controls, while those exposed to 1000 ng/g TDCIPP achieved 20% higher maximum velocity than vehicle-exposed controls. Chicks exposed to 50,000 ng/g TDCIPP showed reduced righting response success. There were no dose- or treatment-related differences in angled beam, gait analysis, or wing flap reflex tests. Cerebrum hemispheres from 10-day-old.chicks were examined for neurochemistry (acetylcholinesterase [AChE] activity and both nicotinic [nACh] and muscarinic [mACh] acetylcholine receptor levels) and cerebellums were examined for histopathology. TDCIPP-exposed chicks had reduced number of degenerate Purkinje cells (TDCIPP, 1000 ng/g), possibly indicating disruption of neurodevelopment. No neurochemical effects were found in TMPP- or TDCIPP-exposed chicks. In general this study shows some possible neurodevelopmental effects in chicks exposed to TDCIPP when levels greatly exceeded those measured in wild bird eggs and no clear changes in TMPP-exposed chicks. This study builds upon previous in vitro studies as well as work on adult birds showing that toxic responses in avian models can vary among species and OPFRs.

Huntingtin Haplotypes Provide Prioritized Target Panels for Allele-specific Silencing in Huntington Disease Patients of European Ancestry	MOLECULAR THERAPY			English	Article							SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; ANTISENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES; MUTANT HUNTINGTIN; MOUSE MODEL; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; EMBRYONIC LETHALITY; GENE HOMOLOG; CAG REPEATS; IN-VIVO; MICE	Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Heterozygous polymorphisms in cis with the mutation allow for allele-specific suppression of the pathogenic HTT transcript as a therapeutic strategy. To prioritize target selection, precise heterozygosity estimates are needed across diverse HD patient populations. Here we present the first comprehensive investigation of all common target alleles across the HTT gene, using 738 reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project and 2364 haplotypes from HD patients and relatives in Canada, Sweden, France, and Italy. The most common HD haplotypes (A1, A2, and A3a) define mutually exclusive sets of polymorphisms for allele-specific therapy in the greatest number of patients. Across all four populations, a maximum of 80% are treatable using these three target haplotypes. We identify a novel deletion found exclusively on the A1 haplotype, enabling potent and selective silencing of mutant HTT in approximately 40% of the patients. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the deletion reduce mutant A1 HTT mRNA by 78% in patient cells while sparing wild-type HTT expression. By suppressing specific haplotypes on which expanded CAG occurs, we demonstrate a rational approach to the development of allele-specific therapy for a monogenic disorder.

The rates of O-2 consumption and CO2 production were higher at the peak of treadmill versus cycle testing (p <= 0.05). Nevertheless, work rate, minute ventilation, tidal volume (V-T), breathing frequency (f(R)), inspiratory capacity (IC), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), tidal esophageal (Pes, tidal) and transdiaphragmatic pressure swings (Pdi, tidal), peak expiratory gastric pressures (Pga, peak), the root mean square of the diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi, rms) expressed as a percentage of maximum EMGdi, rms (EMGdi,rms%max), and dyspnea ratings were similar at the peak of treadmill versus cycle testing (p > 0.05). Ratings of leg discomfort were higher at the peak of cycle versus treadmill exercise (p <= 0.05), even though peak O-2 consumption was lower during cycling. Oxygen consumption, CO2 production, minute ventilation, f(R), Pes, tidal, Pdi, tidal and Pga, peak were higher (p <= 0.05), while V-T, IC, IRV, EMGdi, rms% max, and ratings of dyspnea and leg discomfort were similar (p > 0.05) at all or most submaximal work rates during treadmill versus cycle exercise. Our findings highlight important differences (and similarities) in physiological and perceptual responses at maximal and submaximal work rates during incremental treadmill and cycle exercise testing protocols. The lack of effect of exercise test modality on peak work rate advocates for the use of this readily available parameter to optimize training intensity determination, regardless of exercise training mode.

A common complication resulting from this procedure is brain hemorrhaging from blood vessels clipped off during tissue extraction. Interstitial optical tomography (iOT) has recently been introduced by our group as a mean to assess the presence of blood vessels in the vicinity of the needle. The clinical need to improve safety requires the detection of blood vessels within 2 mm from the outer surface of the needle, since this distance is representative of the volume of tissue that is aspirated durirng tissue extraction. Here, a sensitivity analysis is presented to establish the intrinsic detection limits of iOT based on simulations and experiments using brain tissue phantoms. It is demonstrated that absorbers can be detected with diameters >300 mu m located up to >2 mm from the biopsy needle core for bulk optical properties consistent with brain tissue.

Trends in Prescribing Oral Anticoagulants in Canada, 2008-2014	CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article						NOAC; oral anticoagulants; prescribing trends	ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; SOCIETY; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; WARFARIN; STROKE; PREVENTION; COUNTRIES; UPDATE; DRUG	Purpose: The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, provide several advantages over vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin. Little is known about the trends of prescribing OACs in Canada. In this study we analyzed changes in prescription volumes for OAC drugs since the introduction of the NOACs in Canada overall, by province and by physician specialty. Methods: Canadian prescription volumes for warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban from January 2008 to June 2014 were obtained from the Canadian Compuscript Audit of IMS Health Canada Inc and were analyzed by physician specialty at the national and provincial levels. Total prescriptions by indication were calculated based on data from the Canadian Disease and Therapeutic Index for all OAC indications and for each commonly prescribed dose of dabigatran (75, 110, and 150 mg), rivaroxaban (10, 15, and 20 mg), and apixaban (2.5 and 5 mg). Findings: The overall number of OAC prescriptions in Canada has increased annually since 2008. With the availability of the NOACs, the proportion of total OAC prescriptions attributable to warfarin has steadily decreased, from 99% in 2010 to 67% by June 2014, and the absolute number of warfarin prescriptions has been decreasing since February 2011. The greatest decline in proportionate warfarin prescriptions was in Ontario. In general, the increase of NOAC prescriptions coincided with the introduction of provinces' reimbursement of NOAC prescription costs. The proportion of total OAC prescriptions represented by the NOACs varied by specialty, with the greatest proportionate prescribing found among orthopedic surgeons, cardiologists, and neurologists.

Abnormal epileptic activity is found in central and temporal brain regions, which are involved in reading and semantic and syntactic comprehension. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined reading networks in BED'S children with a new sentence reading comprehension task involving semantic and syntactic processing. Method: Fifteen children with BECTS (age = 11y 1m +/- 16 m; 12 boys) and 18 healthy controls (age = 11 y 8m +/- 20 m; 11 boys) performed an fMRI reading comprehension task in which they read a pair of syntactically complex sentences and decided whether the target sentence (the second sentence in the pair) was true or false with respect to the first sentence. All children also underwent an exhaustive neuropsychological assessment. Results: We demonstrated weaknesses in several cognitive domains in BED'S children. During the sentence reading fMRI task, left inferior frontal regions and bilateral temporal areas were activated in BED'S children and healthy controls. However, additional brain regions such as the left hippocampus and precuneus were activated in mos children. Moreover, specific activation was found in the left caudate and putamen in BED'S children but not in healthy controls. Cognitive results and accuracy during the fMRI task were associated with specific brain activation patterns. Conclusion: BED'S children recruited a wider network to perform the fMRI sentence reading comprehension task, with specific activation in the left dorsal striatum. BED'S cognitive performance differently predicted functional activation in frontal and temporal regions compared to controls, suggesting differences in brain network organisation that contribute to reading comprehension.

In order to investigate the dynamics of the ocular fundus, we present a simple and accurate automated algorithm to segment the inner limiting membrane in video-rate optic nerve head spectral domain (SD) OCT images. The method is based on morphological operations including a two-step contrast enhancement technique, proving to be very robust when dealing with low signal-to-noise ratio images and pathological eyes. An analysis algorithm was also developed to measure neuroretinal tissue deformation from the segmented retinal profiles. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated, and deformation results are presented for healthy and glaucomatous eyes.

Impact on health-related quality of life and costs of managing chronic neuropathic pain in academic pain centres: Results from a one-year prospective observational Canadian study	PAIN RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Chronic neuropathic pain; Economic evaluation; Health-related quality of life; Pain management strategy	IMMPACT RECOMMENDATIONS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; DISABILITY INDEX; QUESTIONNAIRE; DATABASE; BURDEN; MODELS	BACKGROUND: The management of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain (NeP), is a major public health issue. However, there is a paucity of data evaluating pain management strategies in real-life settings. OBJECTIVE: To inform policy makers about the economic value of managing chronic NeP in academic centres by conducting a subeconomic assessment of a Canadian multicentre cohort study aimed at determining the long-term outcomes of the management of chronic NeP in academic pain centres. Specific questions regarding the economic value of this type of program were answered by a subset of patients to provide further information to policy makers. METHODS: Baseline demographic information and several pain-related measurements were collected at baseline, three, six and 12 months in the main study. A resource use questionnaire aimed at determining NeP-related costs and the EuroQoL-5 Dimension were collected in the subset study from consenting patients. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare outcomes over time and according to responder status. RESULTS: A total of 298 patients were evaluated in the present economic evaluation. The mean (+ SD) age of the participants was 53.7+14.0 years, and 56% were female. At intake, the mean duration of NeP was >5 years. Statistically significant improvements in all pain and health-related quality of life outcomes were observed between the baseline and one-year visits. Use decreased over time for many health care resources (eg, visits to the emergency room decreased by one-half), which resulted in overall cost savings. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that increased access to academic pain centres should be facilitated in Canada.

The advances of micro/nanotechnology dovetailed with novel biomaterials have further enhanced biocompatibility, sensitivity, longevity and reliability in newly-emerged low-cost and compact devices. Close-loop systems with both sensing and treatment functions have also been developed to provide point-of-care and personalized medicine. Nevertheless, one of the remaining challenges is whether power can be supplied sufficiently and continuously for the operation of the entire system. This issue is becoming more and more critical to the increasing need of power for wireless communication in implanted devices towards the future healthcare infrastructure, namely mobile health (m-Health). In this review paper, methodologies to transfer and harvest energy in implantable medical devices are introduced and discussed to highlight the uses and significances of various potential power sources.

This generator is used as a source to feed linear and nonlinear loads. A three-leg voltage source converter (VSC)-based distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is implemented using an adaptive neural network-based control algorithm for harmonic suppression, load balancing, and voltage regulation in a three-phase SyRG system with a battery energy storage system. This control algorithm is used for extraction of active and reactive power components of distorted load currents. These components of load currents are used for estimation of reference source currents to generate the gating pulses of VSC used as DSTATCOM. The performance of DSTATCOM is observed satisfactory for this type of power generating system under balanced and unbalanced loads.

Neuroinflammation-Induced Interactions between Protease-Activated Receptor 1 and Proprotein Convertases in HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN; CELL-LINES; C PATHWAY; FURIN; EXPRESSION; CLEAVAGE; MOUSE; INHIBITION; INFECTION	The proprotein convertases (PCs) furin, PC5, PACE4, and PC7 cleave secretory proteins after basic residues, including the HIV envelope glycoprotein (gp160) and Vpr. We evaluated the abundance of PC mRNAs in postmortem brains of individuals exhibiting HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), likely driven by neuroinflammation and neurotoxic HIV proteins (e.g., envelope and Vpr). Concomitant with increased inflammation-related gene expression (interleukin-1 beta [IL-1 beta]), the mRNA levels of the above PCs are significantly increased, together with those of the proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), an inflammation- associated receptor that is cleaved by thrombin at ProArg(41)down arrow (where the down arrow indicates the cleavage location), and potentially by PCs at Arg(41)XXXXArg(46)down arrow. The latter motif in PAR1, but not its R46A mutant, drives its interactions with PCs. Indeed, PAR1 upregulation leads to the inhibition of membrane-bound furin, PC5B, and PC7 and inhibits gp160 processing and HIV infectivity. Additionally, a proximity ligation assay revealed that furin and PC7 interact with PAR1. Reciprocally, increased furin expression reduces the plasma membrane abundance of PAR1 by trapping it in the trans-Golgi network. Furthermore, soluble PC5A/PACE4 can target/disarm cell surface PAR1 through cleavage at Arg(46)down arrow. PACE4/PC5A decreased calcium mobilization induced by thrombin stimulation. Our data reveal a new PC-PAR1-interaction pathway, which offsets the effects of HIV-induced neuroinflammation, viral infection, and potentially the development of HAND.

The Female Sexual Response: Current Models, Neurobiological Underpinnings and Agents Currently Approved or Under Investigation for the Treatment of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder	CNS DRUGS			English	Review							MELANOCORTIN RECEPTOR AGONIST; BUPROPION SUSTAINED-RELEASE; MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; SURGICALLY MENOPAUSAL WOMEN; INCREASES DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION; EJACULATORY REFRACTORY PERIOD; BRAIN MONOAMINERGIC CONTROL; MALE REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR; MALE-RATS; PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN	How a woman responds to sexual cues is highly dependent on a number of distinct, yet related, factors. Researchers have attempted to explain the female sexual response for decades, but no single model reigns supreme. Proper female sexual function relies on the interplay of somatic, psychosocial and neurobiological factors; misregulation of any of these components could result in sexual dysfunction. The most common sexual dysfunction disorder is hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). HSDD is a disorder affecting women across the world; a recent in-person diagnostic interview study conducted in the USA found that an estimated 7.4 % of US women suffer from HSDD. Despite the disorder's prevalence, it is often overlooked as a formal diagnosis. In a survey of primary care physicians and obstetrics/gynaecology specialists, the number one reason for not assigning an HSDD diagnosis was the lack of a safe and effective therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This changed with the recent FDA approval of flibanserin (Addyi (TM)) for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized HSDD; there are still, however, no treatments approved outside the USA. HSDD is characterized by a marked decrease in sexual desire, an absence of motivation (also known as avolition) to engage in sexual activity, and the condition's hallmark symptom, marked patient distress. Research suggests that HSDD may arise from an imbalance of the excitatory and inhibitory neurobiological pathways that regulate the mammalian sexual response; top-down inhibition from the prefrontal cortex may be hyperactive, and/or bottom-up excitation to the limbic system may be hypoactive. Key neuromodulators for the excitatory pathways include norepinephrine, oxytocin, dopamine and melanocortins. Serotonin, opioids and endocannabinoids serve as key neuromodulators for the inhibitory pathways. Evolving treatment strategies have relied heavily on these crucial research findings, as many of the agents currently being investigated as treatment options for HSDD target and influence key players within these excitatory and inhibitory pathways, including various hormone therapies and centrally acting drugs, such as buspirone, bupropion and bremelanotide.

Because ATL is more extensive and involves the lateral and medial parts of the temporal lobe, it may be predicted that its impact onmemory is more important than SAH, which involves resection of medial temporal structures only. However, several studies do not support this assumption. Possible explanations include task-specific factors such as the extent of semantic and syntactic information to be memorized and failure to control for main confounders. We compared preoperative vs. postoperative memory performance in 13 patients with SAH with 26 patients who underwent ATL matched on side of surgery, IQ, age at seizure onset, and age at surgery. Memory function was assessed using the Logical Memory subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scales - 3rd edition (LM-WMS), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), the Digit Span subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test. Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed opposite effects of SAH and ATL on the two verbal learning memory tests. On the immediate recall trial of the LM-WMS, performance deteriorated after ATL in comparison with that after SAH. By contrast, on the delayed recognition trial of the RAVLT, performance deteriorated after SAH compared with that after ATL. However, additional analyses revealed that the latter finding was only observed when surgery was conducted in the right hemisphere. No interaction effects were found on other memory outcomes. The results are congruent with the view that tasks involving rich semantic content and syntactical structure are more sensitive to the effects of lateral temporal cortex resection as compared with mesiotemporal resection. The findings highlight the importance of task selection in the assessment of memory in patients undergoing TLE surgery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evaluating the initial impact of the Riyadh Epilepsy Awareness Campaign	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epilepsy; Awareness; Public attitudes; Perceptions of epilepsy; Public awareness; Epilepsy education	PUBLIC AWARENESS; SAUDI-ARABIA; ATTITUDES; EDUCATION; STIGMA; HEALTH; TRENDS	Objective: We determine the impact of an educational awareness campaign on the level of knowledge and the attitude of the Saudi population in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in an attempt to improve the awareness and reduce the social stigma associated with epilepsy. Methods: The Saudi Epilepsy Society organized a citywide awareness campaign in 2013. A survey consisting of 11 questions pertaining to epilepsy awareness was distributed to Saudi citizens living in Riyadh, aged 15 years and above, in malls, health clubs, mosques, universities, and schools during that campaign. The same questionnaire was administered before and after the awareness campaign to the same individuals on the same day to assess the impact of the campaign (n = 2118). Results: The epilepsy awareness campaign significantly raised the general knowledge about epilepsy: 1519 before vs. 1944 after (P < 0.001) would allow their children to interact with an individual who had epilepsy; 1567 before vs. 688 after (P < 0.001) would not want their children to marry an individual with epilepsy. Eight hundred twenty six before vs. 47 after (P < 0.001) thought that epilepsy is untreatable. Regarding the causes of epilepsy, 1663 before vs. 896 after (P < 0.001) believed that epilepsy is caused by supernatural powers, and 1224 before vs. 1874 after (P < 0.001) chose brain disease as a cause of epilepsy. Conclusion: These findings suggest that epilepsy awareness campaigns can close knowledge gaps. A long-term reevaluation may be needed to assess awareness sustainability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We show that morphine and the antioxidant Nacetylcysteine (NAC) act synergistically to reduce mechanical allodynia in CPIP rats. The tetrapeptide amide [Dm(1)]DALDA (H-Dmt-D-ArgPhe-Lys-NH2) is a potent and selective p opioid receptor (MOR) agonist with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and with antioxidant activity due to its N-terminal Dmt (2',6'-dimethyltyrosine) residue. In the CPIP model, [Dmti]IDALDA was 15-fold more potent than morphine in reversing mechanical allodynia and 4.5-fold more potent as analgesic in the heat algesia test. The results indicate that bifunctional compounds with MOR agonist/antioxidant activity have therapeutic potential for the treatment of CRPS-I.

Neuropathic pain phenotyping by international consensus (NeuroPPIC) for genetic studies: a NeuPSIG systematic review, Delphi survey, and expert panel recommendations	PAIN			English	Review						Neuropathic pain; Genetics; Phenotype; Systematic review; Delphi survey	POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA PHN; CASE-CONTROL ASSOCIATION; LUMBAR DISC HERNIATION; LOW-BACK-PAIN; SENSORY NEUROPATHY; RISK PREDICTION; POPULATION; HAPLOTYPE; SCIATICA; ALLELE	For genetic research to contribute more fully to furthering our knowledge of neuropathic pain, we require an agreed, valid, and feasible approach to phenotyping, to allow collaboration and replication in samples of sufficient size. Results from genetic studies on neuropathic pain have been inconsistent and have met with replication difficulties, in part because of differences in phenotypes used for case ascertainment. Because there is no consensus on the nature of these phenotypes, nor on the methods of collecting them, this study aimed to provide guidelines on collecting and reporting phenotypes in cases and controls for genetic studies. Consensus was achieved through a staged approach: (1) systematic literature review to identify all neuropathic pain phenotypes used in previous genetic studies; (2) Delphi survey to identify the most useful neuropathic pain phenotypes and their validity and feasibility; and (3) meeting of experts to reach consensus on the optimal phenotype(s) to be collected from patients with neuropathic pain for genetic studies. A basic "entry level" set of phenotypes was identified for any genetic study of neuropathic pain. This set identifies cases of "possible" neuropathic pain, and controls, and includes: (1) a validated symptom-based questionnaire to determine whether any pain is likely to be neuropathic; (2) body chart or checklist to identify whether the area of pain distribution is neuroanatomically logical; and (3) details of pain history (intensity, duration, any formal diagnosis). This NeuroPPIC "entry level" set of phenotypes can be expanded by more extensive and specific measures, as determined by scientific requirements and resource availability.

A trunk postural control test protocol, controlling for the influence of body size on performance, was implemented to carry out between-subject comparisons. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of sex and low back pain status with the use of two measures of trunk postural control, the first based on chair motion, and the second based on trunk motion. Methods: Thirty-six subjects (with and without low back pain) performed three 60-s trunk postural control trials with their eyes closed while seated on an instrumented wobble chair, following a calibration procedure. Chair and trunk angular kinematics were measured with an optoelectronic system. A chair-based stabilogram and a trunk-based (lumbar spine) stabilogram were created using the angular motions produced in the sagittal and frontal planes. Twenty body-sway measures were computed for each stabilogram. Findings: The calibration task efficiently controlled for the influence of body size. Several sex effects were detected, with most of them originating from the trunk-based measures. Subjects with low back pain and healthy controls showed comparable trunk postural control. Interpretation: Sex differences were substantiated for the first time, but almost only with the trunk-based stabilogram, showing that the kinematic information captured on the trunk segments is quite different from what is captured on the wobble chair. Contrary to previous studies, pain status was not related to lowered trunk postural control, which can be attributed to the patients recruited or measurement reliability issues.

It is unknown however, how changes in excitatory or inhibitory neurochemical expression (glutamate, -aminobutyric acid (GABA)) contribute to skill acquisition during development. Here we used single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) to reveal how differences in cortical glutamate vs. GABA ratios relate to face proficiency and working memory abilities in children and adults. We show that higher glutamate levels in the inferior frontal gyrus correlated positively with face processing proficiency in the children, but not the adults, an effect which was independent of age-dependent differences in underlying cortical gray matter. Moreover, we found that glutamate/GABA levels and gray matter volume are dissociated at the different maturational stages. These findings suggest that increased excitation during development is linked to neuroplasticity and the acquisition of new cognitive skills.

However, the neuroanatomical correlates of pED are still unclear. In this work, we obtained cortical thickness (CTh) measurements from structural magnetic resonance images of 40 pED patients and 39 healthy control subjects. Abnormalities in CTh related to pED were explored using a scale space search based brain morphometric analysis. Organizations of brain structural covariance networks were analyzed as well. Compared with healthy men, pED patients showed significantly decreased CTh in widespread cortical regions, most of which were previously reported to show abnormal dynamics of male SA in pED, such as the medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, cingulate, inferotemporal, and insular cortices. CTh reductions in these areas were found to be significantly correlated with male sexual functioning degradation. Moreover, pED patients showed decreased interregional CTh correlations from the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex to the right supramarginal gyrus and the left angular cortex, implying disassociations between the cognitive, motivational, and inhibitory networks of male SA in pED. This work provides structural insights on the complex phenomenon of psychogenic sexual dysfunction in men, and suggests a specific vulnerability factor, possibly as an extra organic factor, that may play an important role in pED.

Alterations have been noted in grey and white matter, in the brain's resting state, on the glutamatergic system, and on neural and behavioural responses to aversive stimuli. These effects can be linked to psychiatric disorder such as depression and anxiety disorders that are influenced by excessive exposure to early life stressors. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of NCEs on these systems. Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), aversion task fMRI, glutamate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) were combined with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) in healthy subjects to examine the impact of NCEs on the brain. Low CTQ scores, a measure of NCEs, were related to higher resting state glutamate levels and higher resting state entropy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). CTQ scores, mPFC glutamate and entropy, correlated with neural BOLD responses to the anticipation of aversive stimuli in regions throughout the aversion-related network, with strong correlations between all measures in the motor cortex and left insula. Structural connectivity strength, measured using mean fractional anisotropy, between the mPFC and left insula correlated to aversion-related signal changes in the motor cortex. These findings highlight the impact of NCEs on multiple inter-related brain systems. In particular, they highlight the role of a prefrontal-insular-motor cortical network in the processing and responsivity to aversive stimuli and its potential adaptability by NCEs.

Dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases: a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial	LANCET ONCOLOGY			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL; BRAIN METASTASES; CLINICAL-TRIALS; CANCER; THERAPY; QUESTIONNAIRE; UPDATE	Background Pain flare occurs after palliative radiotherapy, and dexamethasone has shown potential for prevention of such flare. We aimed to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone with that of placebo in terms of reduction of incidence of pain flare. Methods In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, patients from 23 Canadian centres were randomly allocated (1:1) with a web-based system and minimisation algorithm to receive either two 4 mg dexamethasone tablets or two placebo tablets taken orally at least 1 h before the start of radiation treatment (a single 8 Gy dose to bone metastases; day 0) and then every day for 4 days after radiotherapy (days 1-4). Patients were eligible if they had a non-haematological malignancy and bone metastasis (or metastases) corresponding to the clinically painful area or areas. Patients reported their worst pain scores and opioid analgesic intake before treatment and daily for 10 days after radiation treatment. They completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life QLQ-C15-PAL, the bone metastases module (EORTC QLQ-BM22), and the Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire at baseline, and at days 10 and 42 after radiation treatment. Pain flare was defined as at least a two-point increase on a scale of 0-10 in the worst pain score with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% or greater increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in the worst pain score from days 0-10, followed by a return to baseline levels or below. Primary analysis of incidence of pain flare was by intention-to-treat (patients with missing primary data were classified as having pain flare). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01248585, and is completed. Findings Between May 30, 2011, and Dec 11, 2014, 298 patients were enrolled. 39 (26%) of 148 patients randomly allocated to the dexamethasone group and 53 (35%) of 150 patients in the placebo group had a pain flare (difference 8.9%, lower 95% confidence bound 0.0, one-sided p=0.05). Two grade 3 and one grade 4 biochemical hyperglycaemic events occurred in the dexamethasone group (without known clinical effects) compared with none in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were bone pain (61 [41%] of 147 vs 68 [48%] of 143), fatigue (58 [39%] of 147 vs 49 [34%] of 143), constipation (47 [32%] of 147 vs 37 [26%] of 143), and nausea (34 [23%] of 147 vs 34 [24%] of 143), most of which were mild grade 1 or 2. Interpretation Dexamethasone reduces radiation-induced pain flare in the treatment of painful bone metastases.

Neurotensin enhances glutamatergic EPSCs in VTA neurons by acting on different neurotensin receptors	PEPTIDES			English	Article						Neurotensin; Ventral tegmental area; Glutamatergic EPSCs; SR142948A; SR48692	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; MIDBRAIN DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; ENDOGENOUS NEUROTENSIN; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; SYNAPTIC INPUTS; NMDA RECEPTORS; BINDING-SITE	Neurotensin (NT) is an endogenous neuropeptide that modulates dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission in several limbic regions innervated by neurons located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). While several studies showed that NT exerted a direct modulation on VTA dopamine neurons less is known about its role in the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in this region. The present study was aimed at characterising the effects of NT on glutamate-mediated responses in different populations of VTA neurons. Using whole cell patch clamp recording technique in horizontal rat brain slices, we measured the amplitude of glutamatergic excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by electrical stimulation of VTA afferents before and after application of different concentrations of NT1-13 or its Cterminal fragment, NT8-13. Neurons were classified as either I-h(+) or I-h(-) based on the presence or absence of a hyperpolarisation activated cationic current (I-h). We found that NT1-13 and NT8-13 produced comparable concentration dependent increase in the amplitude of EPSCs in both Ih' and neurons. In I-h(+) neurons, the enhancement effect of NT8-13 was blocked by both antagonists, while in neurons it was blocked by the NTS1/NTS2 antagonist, SR142948A, but not the preferred NTS1 antagonist, SR48692. In as much as neurons are non-dopaminergic neurons and I-h(+) neurons represent both dopamine and nondopamine neurons, we can conclude that NT enhances glutamatergic mediated responses in dopamine, and in a subset of non-dopamine, neurons by acting respectively on NTS1 and an NT receptor other than NTS1.

Method: The authors used RNA sequencing, a powerful technique that captures the complexity of gene expression, in postmortem tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex from 13 bipolar disorder case subjects and 13 matched comparison subjects. Differential expression was computed, and a global pattern of downregulation was detected, with 10 transcripts significant at a false discovery rate <= 5%. Importantly, all 10 genes were also replicated in an independent RNA sequencing data set (N=61) from the anterior cingulate cortex. Results: Among the most significant results were genes coding for class A G protein-coupled receptors: SSTR2 (somatostatin receptor 2), CHRM2 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 2), and RXFP1 (relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1). A gene ontology analysis of the entire set of differentially expressed genes pointed to an over-representation of genes involved in G protein-coupled receptor regulation. The top genes were followed up by querying the effect of treatment with mood stabilizers commonly prescribed in bipolar disorder, which showed that these drugs modulate expression of the candidate genes. Conclusions: By using RNA sequencing in the postmortem bipolar disorder brain, an interesting profile of G protein-coupled receptor dysregulation was identified, several new bipolar disorder genes were indicated, and the noncoding transcriptome in bipolar disorder was characterized. These findings have important implications with regard to fine-tuning our understanding of the bipolar disorder brain, as well as for identifying potential new drug target pathways.

This is the first report of the International Society for Bipolar Disorder (ISBD) Task Force on Older-Age Bipolar Disorder (OABD). MethodsThis task force report addresses the unique aspects of OABD including epidemiology and clinical features, neuropathology and biomarkers, physical health, cognition, and care approaches. ResultsThe report describes an expert consensus summary on OABD that is intended to advance the care of patients, and shed light on issues of relevance to BD research across the lifespan. Although there is still a dearth of research and health efforts focused on older adults with BD, emerging data have brought some answers, innovative questions, and novel perspectives related to the notion of late onset, medical comorbidity, and the vexing issue of cognitive impairment and decline. ConclusionsImproving our understanding of the biological, clinical, and social underpinnings relevant to OABD is an indispensable step in building a complete map of BD across the lifespan.

In this study, we investigated whether targeting of N-cadherin represents a potential treatment for the similar to 50% of MM patients with elevated N-cadherin. Initially, we stably knocked-down N-cadherin in the mouse MM plasma cell (PC) line 5TGM1 to assess the functional role of N-cadherin in MM pathogenesis. When compared with 5TGM1-scramble-shRNA cells, 5TGM1-Cdh2-shRNA cells had significantly reduced adhesion to bone marrow endothelial cells. However, N-cadherin knock-down did not affect 5TGM1 cell proliferation or adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells. In the C57BL/KaLwRij murine MM model, mice intravenously inoculated with 5TGM1-Cdh2-shRNA cells showed significantly decreased tumour burden after 4 weeks, compared with animals bearing 5TGM1-scramble-shRNA cells. Finally, the N-cadherin antagonist ADH-1 had no effect on tumour burden in the established disease setting, whereas up-front ADH-1 treatment resulted in significantly reduced tumour burden after 4 weeks. Our findings demonstrate that N-cadherin may play a key role in the extravasation of circulating MM PCs promoting bone marrow homing. Moreover, these studies suggest that N-cadherin may represent a viable therapeutic target to prevent the dissemination of MM PCs and delay MM disease progression.

The targeting of physiologic features of epileptogenesis in FCD and colocalizing functionality has enhanced completeness of surgical resection, the main determinant of outcome. Electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography are helpful in guiding electrode implantation and surgical treatment, and high-frequency oscillations help defining the extent of the epileptogenic dysplasia. Ultra high-field MRI has a role in understanding the laminar organization of the cortex, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is highly sensitive for detecting FCD in MRI-negative cases. Multimodal imaging is clinically valuable, either by improving the rate of postoperative seizure freedom or by reducing postoperative deficits. However, there is no level 1 evidence that it improves outcomes. Prooffor a specific effect of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in FCD is lacking. Pathogenic mutations recently described in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes in FCD have yielded important insights into novel treatment options with mTOR inhibitors, which might represent an example of personalized treatment of epilepsy based on the known mechanisms of disease. The ketogenic diet (KD) has been demonstrated to be particularly effective in children with epilepsy caused by structural abnormalities, especially FCD. It attenuates epigenetic chromatin modifications, a master regulator for gene expression and functional adaptation of the cell, thereby modifying disease progression. This could imply lasting benefit of dietary manipulation. Neurostimulation techniques have produced variable clinical outcomes in FCD. In widespread dysplasias, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has achieved responder rates >50%; however, the efficacy of noninvasive cranial nerve stimulation modalities such as transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) and noninvasive (nVNS) requires further study. Althoughreview of current strategies underscores the serious shortcomings of treatment-resistant cases, initial evidence from novel approaches suggests that future success is possible.

In this paper we focus on the case where the input also has a rich structure and the input and output structures are somehow related. We describe systems that learn to attend to different places in the input, for each element of the output, for a variety of tasks: machine translation, image caption generation, video clip description, and speech recognition. All these systems are based on a shared set of building blocks: gated recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks, along with trained attention mechanisms. We report on experimental results with these systems, showing impressively good performance and the advantage of the attention mechanism.

Interaction of CRF and Kappa Opioid Systems on GABAergic Neurotransmission in the Mouse Central Amygdala	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; ETHANOL-DEPENDENT RATS; INDUCED REINSTATEMENT; CENTRAL NUCLEUS; RECEPTOR; STRESS; DYNORPHIN; PRODYNORPHIN; SENSITIVITY; ANTAGONISTS	The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) systems are both implicated in stress-related behaviors and drug dependence. Although previous studies suggest that antagonism of each system blocks aspects of experimental models of drug dependence, the possible interaction between these systems at the neuronal level has not been completely examined. We used an in vitro brain slice preparation to investigate the interaction of these two peptide systems on inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Application of exogenous CRF increased the mean frequency of GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC) by 20.2%, suggesting an increase in presynaptic GABA release. Although the pharmacological blockade of KORs by norBNI alone did not significantly affect mIPSC frequency, it significantly enhanced the effect of CRF (by 43.9%, P = 0.02). Similarly, the CRF effects in slices from KOR knockout (KO) mice (84.0% increase) were significantly greater than in wild-type (WT) mice (24.6%, P = 0.01), although there was no significant difference in baseline mIPSC frequency between slices from KOR KO and WT mice. The increase in CRF action in the presence of norBNI was abolished by a CRF-1 receptor antagonist but was unaffected by a CRF-2 receptor antagonist. We hypothesize that CRF facilitates the release of an endogenous ligand for KORs and that subsequent activation of KOR receptors modulates presynaptic effects of CRF in CeA. These results suggest that potential pharmacotherapies aimed at neurobehavioral and addictive disorders may need to involve both the KOR/dynorphin and the CRF systems in CeA.

There are, however, neurophysiological changes across different areas of the peripheral and central nervous systems, including peripheral receptors, dorsal horn of the spinal cord, brain stem, sensorimotor cortical areas, and the mesolimbic and prefrontal areas associated with chronic musculoskeletal disorders, including chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, and tendon injuries. These neurophysiological changes appear not only to be a consequence of peripheral structural injury but also to play a part in the pathophysiology of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Neurophysiological changes are consistent with a biopsychosocial formulation reflecting the underlying mechanisms associated with sensory and motor findings, psychological traits, and perceptual changes associated with chronic musculoskeletal conditions. These changes, therefore, have important implications in the clinical manifestation, pathophysiology, and treatment of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Musculoskeletal rehabilitation professionals have at their disposal tools to address these neuroplastic changes, including top-down cognitive-based interventions (eg, education, cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation, motor imagery) and bottom-up physical interventions (eg, motor learning, peripheral sensory stimulation, manual therapy) that induce neuroplastic changes across distributed areas of the nervous system and affect outcomes in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Furthermore, novel approaches such as the use of transcranial direct current stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be utilized to help renormalize neurological function. Comprehensive treatment addressing peripheral structural injury as well as neurophysiological changes occurring across distributed areas of the nervous system may help to improve outcomes in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders.

Estimation of foliar chlorophyll and nitrogen content in an ombrotrophic bog from hyperspectral data: Scaling from leaf to image	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Peatland; Airborne hyperspectral; Foliar chlorophyll; Nitrogen; CASI; Ombrotrophic bog	REMOTE-SENSING APPROACH; SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; NORTHERN PEATLAND; CANOPY NITROGEN; PIGMENT CONTENT; SATELLITE DATA; PLANT-LEAVES; WIDE-RANGE; FOREST; CARBON	The relationship between spectral reflectance and foliar chlorophyll (Chl) and nitrogen (N) was examined for 19 species over a six-month growing period at Mer Bleue, an ombrotrophic bog located near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The goal of this study was to model total Chl and N concentration at the landscape-scale from remotely sensed data utilizing a model insensitive to plant functional type (PFT), species and season. To date the relationship between spectral reflectance and foliar properties is poorly understood in peatlands owing to the scarcity of studies examining the spectral variability between mosses and vascular plants. A model that comprised a continuous wavelet transform coupled with a neural network was constructed to predict Chl and N content from selected wavelet features (coefficients) at both leaf and airborne image scales. The model was compared to thirteen common spectral indices used to determine vegetation properties in forest environments. The heterogeneity of the vascular plant/moss cover over small spatial scales (<1 m) and the spectral complexity of the vegetation cover, precluded a regression model to be derived from the spectral indices for all species across seasons; the best model for all species combined was R-2 = 0.3. The final continuous wavelet model resulted in a noticeable improvement with R-2 values ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 (for both Chl and N content). We scaled up our predictive model from the leaf/capitulum level data to 40 cm spatial resolution 72-band airborne imagery (CASI-2 429.6-968.8 nm) to create surfaces of Chi and N content for the study area.

J	Kim, YJ; Mullen, KT				Kim, Yeon Jin; Mullen, Kathy T.			The dynamics of cross-orientation masking at monocular and interocular sites	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Color vision; Temporal properties; Psychophysics; Dichoptic; Isoluminance	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; DETECTION MECHANISMS; CONTRAST GAIN; HUMAN VISION; SURROUND SUPPRESSION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; DICHOPTIC MASKING; MACAQUE MONKEY	We investigated the temporal properties of monocular and dichoptic cross-orientation masking (XOM) mediating suppressive or facilitatory cross-channel interactions between the neural detectors for the test and orthogonal mask stimuli. We measured the evolution of masking as a function of the duration of the test and mask stimuli to determine its time constant, and determined its dependence on stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), for three contrast combinations: color-only (red-green color test and mask), luminance-only (luminance test and mask) and color-luminance (color test and luminance mask). Results show that the temporal properties of monocular and dichoptic masking differ markedly from each other and across contrast type. For the color-only condition, the dichoptic suppressive interaction is significantly longer than for the monocular one and both are largely independent of SOA. For the luminance-only condition, the suppressive interactions in both presentations are faster than for color, have similar time constants, but have different dependencies on SOA. For the color-luminance condition under the monocular conditions, cross-orientation facilitation (XOF) occurs with the luminance mask speeding up the processing of the color test with greatest XOF when the luminance mask precedes the color test by around 22 ms. No significant effects are observed for the dichoptic condition. Effects are invariant across spatial frequency. These strongly differential dynamic effects suggest that there is separate encoding of color contrast, luminance contrast, and their combination at the relatively early within-eye stage of processing, which is distinct from the dichoptic site.

Genome-wide variant by serum urate interaction in Parkinson's disease	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							URIC-ACID; OXIDATIVE STRESS; FOLLOW-UP; ASSOCIATION; PROGRESSION; NEUROPROTECTION; METAANALYSIS; PREDICTOR; SCLEROSIS; OBESITY	ObjectiveSerum urate levels have been associated with risk for and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Urate-related compounds are therapeutic candidates in neuroprotective efforts to slow PD progression. A urate-elevating agent is currently under investigation as a potential disease-modifying strategy in people with PD. However, PD is a heterogeneous disorder, and genetic variation may explain divergence in disease severity and progression. MethodsWe conducted a genome-wide association study to identify gene variant x serum urate interaction effects on the striatal I-123-ioflupane (DaTscan) binding ratio measured using single photon emission computed tomography in patients with possible PD from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI, n = 360). Follow-up analyses were conducted to assess gene variant x serum urate interaction effects on magnetic resonance imaging-derived regional brain volumes and clinical status. We then attempted to replicate our primary analysis in patients who entered the Parkinson Research Examination of CEP-1347 Trial (PRECEPT) with a clinical diagnosis of PD (n = 349). ResultsRs1109303 (T>G) variant within the INPP5K gene on chromosome 17p13.3 demonstrated a genome-wide significant interaction with serum urate level to predict striatal dopamine transporter density among all PPMI participants (n = 359) with possible PD (p = 2.01 x 10(-8); after excluding participants with SWEDD [scan without evidence of dopaminergic deficit]: p = 1.12 x 10(-9); n = 316). Independent of striatal dopamine transporter density, similar effects on brain atrophy, bradykinesia, anxiety, and depression were observed. No effect was present in the PRECEPT sample at baseline; however, in non-SWEDD PD participants in PRECEPT (n = 309), we observed a significant longitudinal genotype x serum urate interaction effect, consistent in direction with the PPMI sample, on progression of striatal dopamine transporter density over the 22-month follow-up. InterpretationGenetic profile combined with serum urate level can be used to predict disease severity and potential disease progression in patients with PD. These results may be relevant to therapeutic efforts targeting the urate pathway.

Attenuation of dendritic spine density in the perirhinal cortex following 17 beta-Estradiol replacement in the rat	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						17-beta estradiol; perirhinal cortex; synaptic plasticity; dendritic spines; mature spines	OBJECT-RECOGNITION MEMORY; OVARIECTOMIZED RHESUS-MONKEYS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FEMALE RATS; LONG-TERM; POSTRHINAL CORTICES; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; ESTROGEN; NEURONS; PLASTICITY	Intraperirhinal cortex infusion of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) impairs object-recognition memory. However, it is not currently known whether this hormone modulates synaptic plasticity in this structure. Most excitatory synapses in the central nervous system are located on dendritic spines, and elevated E2 levels influence the density of these spines in several brain areas. The goal of the present study was to determine whether differences in dendritic spine density in the perirhinal cortex are observed following high E2 replacement in ovariectomized rats. The density of total spines, and mushroom-shaped (i.e. mature) spines were compared between a high E2 replacement (10 mu g/kg/day, s.c.) and a no replacement condition. The perirhinal cortex is subdivided into Broadmann's area 35 and 36 and so group comparisons were made within each sub-region separately. High E2 replacement resulted in lower density of mushroom-shaped spines in area 35 relative to no replacement. There was no effect of high E2 replacement on dendritic spine density in area 36. These findings are consistent with the idea that higher E2 levels reduce dendritic spine density in area 35, which may result from spine shrinkage, or reduced synapse formation. This study provides preliminary evidence for a mechanism through which E2 may impair object-recognition memory. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We present our experience of using this new neuronavigation system in neurovascular surgery and discuss the feasibility of this technology for aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs). We developed an augmented reality system that uses an external camera to capture the live view of the patient on the operating room table and to merge this view with pre-operative volume-rendered vessels. We have extensively tested the system in the laboratory and have used the system in four surgical cases: one aneurysm, two AVMs and one AVF case. The developed AR neuronavigation system allows for precise patient-to-image registration and calibration of the camera, resulting in a well-aligned augmented reality view. Initial results suggest that augmented reality is useful for tailoring craniotomies, localizing vessels of interest, and planning resection corridors. Augmented reality is a promising technology for neurovascular surgery. However, for more complex anomalies such as AVMs and AVFs, better visualization techniques that allow one to distinguish between arteries and veins and determine the absolute depth of a vessel of interest are needed.

Medical students () and neurosurgery residents () completed four simulated Glioblastoma multiforme resections. Simulated surgeries took place over four days with intermittent spacing in between (average time between surgeries of 4.77 0.73 days). The volume of tumor removed (cc), volume of healthy brain removed (cc), and instrument path length (mm) were recorded. Additionally, surgical effectiveness (% tumor removed divided by % healthy brain removed) and efficiency (% tumor removed divided by instrument movement in mm) were calculated. Performance was compared (1) between groups, and (2) for each participant over time to assess the learning curve. In addition, the effect of real-time instruction ("coaching") was assessed with a randomly selected group of medical students. Neurosurgery residents removed less healthy brain, were more effective in removing tumor and sparing healthy brain tissue, required less instrument movement, and were more efficient in removing tumor tissue than medical students. Medical students approached the resident level of performance over serial sessions. Coached medical students showed more conservative surgical behavior, removing both less tumor and less healthy brain. In sum, neurosurgery residents removed more tumor, removed less healthy brain, and required less instrument movement than medical students. Coaching modified medical student performance. Virtual Reality brain surgery can differentiate operators based on both recent and long-term experience and may be useful in the acquisition and assessment of neurosurgical skills. Coaching alters the learning curve of na < ve inexperienced individuals.

Objective: To describe ChEI related ADRs in Alzheimer's disease (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and characterize their seriousness as reported by national pharmacovigilance systems to VigiBase, a World Health Organization International Drug Monitoring Program database, between 1998 and 2013. Methods: All ChEI related reports, submitted to VigiBase between 1998 and 2013 from the five continents were extracted. Analyses were carried out for general, serious, and nonserious ADRs. Results: A total of 18955 reports (43753 ADRs) from 58 countries were reported: 60.1% in women; mean age 77.4 +/- 9.1 years. Most reports originated from Europe (47.6%) and North America (40.4%). Rivastigmine and donepezil were involved in most reports (41.4% each). The most frequently reported ADRs were neuropsychiatric (31.4%), gastrointestinal (15.9%), general (11.9%), and cardiovascular (11.7%) disorders. During the 2006-2013 period, serious ADRs remained more often reported than nonserious ones; the most serious were neuropsychiatric (34.0%), general (14.0%), cardiovascular (12.1%), and gastrointestinal (11.6%) disorders. Medication errors were reported in 2.0% of serious cases. Death occurred in 2.3% of the reports. Conclusions: This international pharmacovigilance study highlights the ADR pattern induced by ChEIs. Neuropsychiatric events were the most frequently reported ADRs. Serious cardiovascular events were frequently reported, suggesting that their significance has probably been previously underestimated. Given the frailty of the patients and the frequent comedications, caution is advised before introducing a ChEI.

In the mature organism, however, they are bound to the confines of the nervous system. Likewise metastatic cancer cells have the potential to establish auxiliary tumor sites in remote tissues or entirely different organs. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition is the transformation of proliferative cancer cells into a highly invasive state, which facilitates the crossing of tissue boundaries and migration across various environments. This review contributes a first look into the parallels and contrasts between physical aspects of neuronal and metastatic cancer cells.

At the organismal level, microtubules are crucial for various biological processes, such as viral entry, inflammation, immunity, learning and memory in mammals. Microtubules are subject to various covalent modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity. Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and function.

CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Pediatric; Intracranial pressure monitoring; Practice guidelines; Glasgow coma score	BRAIN-INJURY; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Despite pediatric guidelines, variability exists in the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), as somewhere between 7 and 60 % of children undergo intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Reasons for this low adherence to TBI management guidelines remain unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the current practices at CHU Sainte-Justine with regards to ICP monitoring in severe TBI and explore the reasons why ICP monitoring is not undertaken. A retrospective review was conducted of all patients age 1 month to 18 years, with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) a parts per thousand currency sign8) from 2007 to 2014. Presence of ICP monitoring, head imaging reports, and reasons for lack of monitoring were recorded. Sixty-four patients with severe TBI were admitted. Twenty (31 %) patients had invasive ICP monitoring in the first 6 h and 5 in the following 24 h. Improvement of the GCS on arrival to tertiary care center (20 %, n = 13) and moribund status (20 %, n = 13) were the two main reasons ICP monitoring was not undertaken. Fourteen patients (21 %) with reassuring cerebral tomography (Rotterdam scores 1-3) and median GCS 7 (IQR 6-8) were initially followed with clinical surveillance, five of which ended up with an ICP monitor (> 6 h). Our study confirms that many children with severe TBI do not undergo ICP monitoring, mainly due to rapid improvement or moribund status. A subgroup of patients, with reassuring cerebral CT scan, was not monitored. Further research is necessary to assess if imaging should be considered in ICP indication, as in adult guidelines.

J	Najafian, A; Haghighat, F; Moreau, A				Najafian, Arman; Haghighat, Fariborz; Moreau, Alain			Integration of PCM in domestic hot water tanks: Optimization for shifting peak demand	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Thermal storage; Discharge time; Power demand shift; PCM; ANN; Optimization	PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; THERMAL-ENERGY STORAGE; UNFULFILLED PROMISE; SOLAR DHW; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; MODULE	Most of the current domestic hot water tanks store heat in sensible form. Latent heat storage systems have become popular recently due to their capacity of storing energy in high density with slight temperature variation. They use phase change materials (PCMs) as the storage medium which have a high heat of fusion and are able to store and release large amount of energy. This paper reports the outcomes of implementing PCM in a standard domestic hot water tank, on energy consumption and the discharge period and suggests a method for optimization of the tanks regarding their discharge time. Geometrical aspects of PCM containers and the amount of PCM inside the tank were design parameters of this study. TRNSYS was used to simulate the behavior of the tank with PCM. Artificial neural network was used to find a correlation between design parameters of the tank and the discharge time. Genetic Algorithm was then used in order to find the optimum amount of PCM needed for a desired peak shift. Finally, a comparison between an optimized tank with PCM and a tank without PCM was performed and it was concluded that an optimized tank is able to provide hot water while consuming less energy compared to the regular one (without PCM). Furthermore, by applying a certain amount of PCM, electrical energy consumption could be shifted completely to off peak periods characterized by less power demand. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In such a case, it is necessary to make assumptions on the sources to restore identifiability. This problem is encountered in brain-source imaging when identifying the source signals from noisy electroencephalographic or magnetoencephalographic measurements. This inverse problem has been widely studied during recent decades, giving rise to an impressive number of methods using different priors. Nevertheless, a thorough study of the latter, including especially sparse and tensor-based approaches, is still missing. In this article, we propose 1) a taxonomy of the algorithms based on methodological considerations; 2) a discussion of the identifiability and convergence properties, advantages, drawbacks, and application domains of various techniques; and 3) an illustration of the performance of seven selected methods on identical data sets. Directions for future research in the area of biomedical imaging are eventually provided.

The main advantages of the developed scheme are: 1) NNs are utilized to approximately describe nonlinearities and unknown dynamics of the nonlinear time-delay systems, making it possible to deal with unknown nonlinear uncertain systems and pursue the L infinity performance of the tracking error; 2) using the finite covering lemma together with the NNs approximators, the Krasovskii function is abandoned, which paves the way for obtaining the L infinity performance of the tracking error; 3) by introducing an initializing technique, the L infinity performance of the tracking error can be achieved; 4) using a generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) model, the limitation of the traditional PI hysteresis model is overcome; and 5) by applying the Young's inequalities to deal with the weight vector of the NNs, the updated laws are needed only at the last controller design step with only two parameters being estimated, which reduces the computational burden. It is proved that the proposed scheme can guarantee semiglobal stability of the closed-loop system and achieves the L infinity performance of the tracking error. Simulation results for general second-order time-delay nonlinear systems and the tuning metal cutting system are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

We investigated the extent to which AN is associated with a distinct methylation profile compared to that seen in normal-eater women. MethodGenome-wide methylation profiles, obtained using DNA from whole blood, were determined in 29 women currently ill with AN (10 with AN-restrictive type, 19 with AN-binge/purge type) and 15 normal-weight, normal-eater control women, using 450 K Illumina bead arrays. ResultsRegardless of type, AN patients showed higher and less-variable global methylation patterns than controls. False Discovery Rate corrected comparisons identified 14 probes that were hypermethylated in women with AN relative to levels obtained in normal-eater controls, representing genes thought to be associated with histone acetylation, RNA modification, cholesterol storage and lipid transport, and dopamine and glutamate signaling. Age of onset was significantly associated with differential methylation in gene pathways involved in development of the brain and spinal cord, while chronicity of illness was significantly linked to differential methylation in pathways involved with synaptogenesis, neurocognitive deficits, anxiety, altered social functioning, and bowel, kidney, liver and immune function. DiscussionAlthough pre-existing differences cannot be ruled out, our findings are consistent with the idea of secondary alterations in methylation at genomic regions pertaining to social-emotional impairments and physical sequelae that are commonly seen in AN patients. Further investigation is needed to establish the clinical relevance of the affected genes in AN, and, importantly, reversibility of effects observed with nutritional rehabilitation and treatment.

JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; subdural hematoma; acute subdural hematoma; nonsurgical subdural hematoma; trauma	CEREBRAL ATROPHY; PRACTICAL SCALE; INJURY; BICAUDATE; SCORE; COMA	OBJECT The Brain Trauma Foundation has published guidelines on the surgical management of traumatic subdural hematoma (SDH). However, no data exist on the proportion of patients with SDH that can be selected for conservative management and what is the outcome of these patients. The goals of this study were as follows: 1) to establish what proportion of patients are initially treated conservatively; 2) to determine what proportion of patients will deteriorate and require surgical evacuation; and 3) to identify risk factors associated with deterioration and delayed surgery. METHODS All cases of acute traumatic SDH (869 when inclusion criteria were met) presenting over a 4-year period were reviewed. For all conservatively treated SDH, the proportion of delayed surgical intervention and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were taken as outcome measures. Multiple factors were compared between patients who required delayed surgery and patients without surgery. RESULTS Of the 869 patients with acute traumatic SDH, 646 (74.3%) were initially treated conservatively. A good outcome was achieved in 76.7% of the patients. Only 6.5% eventually required delayed surgery, and the median delay for surgery was 9.5 days. Factors associated with deterioration were as follows: 1) thicker SDH (p < 0.001); 2) greater midline shift (p < 0.001); 3) location at the convexity (p = 0.001); 4) alcohol abuse (p = 0.0260); and 5) history of falls (p = 0.018). There was no significant difference in regard to age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale score, Injury Severity Score, abnormal coagulation, use of blood thinners, and presence of cerebral atrophy or white matter disease. CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients with SDH are treated conservatively. Of those, only 6.5% later required surgery, for raised intracranial pressure or SDH progression. Patients at risk can be identified and followed more carefully.

Therefore, it needs specialized vasculature to provide it with the necessary oxygen and nutrients, while protecting it against pathogens and toxins. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is very tightly regulated by specialized endothelial cells, two basement membranes, and astrocytic endfeet. The proximity of astrocytes to the vessel makes them perfect candidates to influence the function of the BBB. Moreover, other glial cells are also known to contribute to either BBB quiescence or breakdown.

Regulation of human glia by multiple sclerosis disease modifying therapies	SEMINARS IN IMMUNOPATHOLOGY			English	Review							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG FTY720; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; FUMARIC-ACID ESTERS; HUMAN T-CELLS; SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE; INTERFERON-BETA; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; GLATIRAMER ACETATE	This review focuses on the effects of the agents currently approved (or in late clinical trials) as therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) on the glial cell populations of the central nervous system (CNS). These are comprised of astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes (OLs), and their progenitors (OPCs). Although the efficacy of these agents is to date established only for the relapsing component of the disease and linked to effects on the systemic immune system, each has been examined with regard to effects on the CNS compartment. The impact of therapies on glia would include modulating these cells immune reactivity, which is considered to underlie the tissue injury process in MS and to any subsequent repair process. As reviewed, these agents can exert their effects either indirectly by modulating the constituents of the systemic immune system or directly depending on their capacity to traverse the blood brain barrier (BBB). Most available data has been derived from administration of these agents in animal models or application to glial cells in vitro. The challenge remains of translating these observations into effective means to impact on the progressive course of disease and reverse existent disabilities.

This review and meta-regression analysis studies the effect of aging on MMSE scores in schizophrenic patients. Methods: We entered the search terms schizophrenia and MMSE in PubMed and PsychInfo. Bibliographies of pertinent articles were also examined. We included every study presenting the MMSE scores in schizophrenic patients along with a corresponding mean age. We conducted our analyses using simple linear regression weighted for the inverse of within-trial variance of the age variable, thus conferring more importance to studies with narrower age groups. Results: We identified 56 articles (n = 5,588) published between 1990 and 2012. The MMSE scores of schizophrenic patients decline by approximately 1 point for every four years (y = 34.939-0.247x, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [-0.304, -0.189], R-2 = 0,545), which is five times the rate in the general population. Institutionalized patients account for a large proportion of this decline (y = 37.603-0.308x, 95% CI [-0.349, -0.267], R-2 = 0.622) whereas community-dwelling patients are relatively stable throughout aging (y = 27.591-0.026x, 95% CI [-0.074, 0.023], R-2 = 0.037). Conclusions: Subgroup analyses show different trajectories between institutionalized and outpatients with schizophrenia. The deterioration observed in institutionalized patients may have to do with greater illness severity, heavier medication load, vascular risk factors, and lack of stimulation in institutional settings. Studies documenting the role of these variables would be useful. Cognitive screening tools that assess executive functions would be interesting to study in schizophrenics, as they may reveal more subtle age-related cognitive changes not measured by the MMSE.

Early life stress (ELS), especially emotional abuse (EA), is associated with altered reactivity to psychosocial stress in adulthood and moderates or even reverses the stress-attenuating effect of oxytocin (OXT). The neural underpinnings of the interaction between ELS and OXT remain unclear, though. Therefore, we here investigate the joint effect of ELS and OXT on transient changes in amygdala-centered functional connectivity induced by acute psychosocial stress, using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design. Psychophysiological interaction analysis in the placebo session revealed stress-induced increases in functional connectivity between amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, putamen, caudate and thalamus. Regression analysis showed that EA was positively associated with stress-induced changes in connectivity between amygdala and hippocampus. Moreover, hierarchical linear regression showed that this positive association between EA and stress-induced amygdala-hippocampal connectivity was moderated after the administration of intranasal OXT. Amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in the OXT session correlated negatively with cortisol stress responses. Our findings suggest that altered amygdala-hippocampal functional connectivity during psychosocial stress may have a crucial role in the altered sensitivity to OXT effects in individuals who have experienced EA in their childhood.

Here, we employed field potential recordings in an in vitro brain slice preparation to establish the effects induced by the KCC2 blockers VU0240551 (10 mu M) or bumetanide (50 mu M) and by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (10 mu M) on the two types of interictal events. We found that blocking KCC2 activity decreased the amplitude of the short-lasting events. In addition, this pharmacological procedure increased the interval of occurrence of the long-lasting events and reduced their amplitude. Blocking carbonic anhydrase activity with acetazolamide reduced the interval of occurrence and the duration of the short-lasting events while increasing their amplitude; acetazolamide also reduced the duration and amplitude of the long-lasting events. Finally, blocking either KCC2 or carbonic anhydrase activity increased the interval of occurrence of pharmacologically isolated synchronous GABAergic events and decreased their duration and amplitude. These data substantiate further the role of GABA(A) receptor-mediated signaling in driving neuronal populations toward hypersynchronous states presumably by increasing extracellular [K+].

This impairment in gap detection may reflect the interaction of low-level encoding or the division of attention between two sound objects, both of which could interfere with signal detection. To distinguish between these two alternatives, we compared ERPs during active and passive listening with complex harmonic tones that could include a gap, a mistuned harmonic, both features, or neither. During active listening, participants indicated whether they heard a gap irrespective of mistuning. During passive listening, participants watched a subtitled muted movie of their choice while the same sounds were presented. Gap detection was impaired when the complex sounds included a mistuned harmonic that popped out as a separate object. The ERP analysis revealed an early gap-related activity that was little affected by mistuning during the active or passive listening condition. However, during active listening, there was a marked decrease in the late positive wave that was thought to index attention and response-related processes. These results suggest that the limitation in detecting the gap is related to attentional processing, possibly divided attention induced by the concurrent sound objects, rather than deficits in preattentional sensory encoding.

Whereas stressors can affect emotion and impair cognition, environmental enrichment may prevent the occurrence of such negative sequelae. Animals exposed to semi-natural group-housing experience a complex environment; whereas environmental enrichment might protect against stressors, a socially-enriched environment(SEE) could entail aggressive inter-male encounters with additive stress effects. In the present study, we investigated the effects of exposure to external stressors, footshocks and forced swimming, on adrenal gland and body weights as well as on behavior in rats housed under SEE or standard, non-enriched environment (NEE), conditions. We found that SEEs reduced the anxiogenic effects of stress. Moreover, SEEs improved the performance in an operant task and prevented the increase in impulsive behavior produced by external stressors on NEE animals. Whereas these findings are indicative of stress-buffering effects of SEEs, adrenal gland weights were increased while total body weights were decreased in SEE rats, suggesting that SEEs may simultaneously exacerbate physiological measurements of stress. Finally, in the SEE, total aggressive behaviors and body wounds were paradoxically reduced in animals that received external stressors in comparison to non-stressed controls. The consequences of the external stressors applied here are not uniform, varying according to the housing condition and the outcome considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Kent			Upper Face: Clinical Anatomy and Regional Approaches with Injectable Fillers	PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY			English	Article							HYALURONIC-ACID GEL; BROW; INJECTION; POSITION; FAT	Background: The use of facial fillers has been rapidly increased as the range of injectable products and indications continues to expand. Complications may arise from improper placement or technique. This article highlights the importance of anatomic knowledge when using injectable fillers in the face. Methods: A detailed review of the clinical anatomy of the upper face is performed. Regional approaches are described using the applied anatomy to efficiently and safely augment the different subunits of the upper face. Results: Key aspects of safe and successful injection of fillers in the upper face include a thorough knowledge of the location of fat compartments and neurovascular structures. Awareness of these structures enables the practitioner to maximize injections, while avoiding damage to important nerves and vessels. Conclusion: A detailed knowledge of the anatomy and properties of the product is paramount to maximize the efficacy while minimizing the risk of complications.

Trial-unique, delayed nonmatching-to-location (TUNL) touchscreen testing for mice: sensitivity to dorsal hippocampal dysfunction	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Mouse; Hippocampus; Delayed nonmatching-to-location; Touchscreen operant chamber; Spatial working memory; Spatial pattern separation	OPERANT PLATFORM; PATTERN SEPARATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MOUSE BEHAVIOR; MEMORY; RATS; LESIONS; MODEL; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COGNITION	The hippocampus is implicated in many of the cognitive impairments observed in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Often, mice are the species of choice for models of these diseases and the study of the relationship between brain and behaviour more generally. Thus, automated and efficient hippocampal-sensitive cognitive tests for the mouse are important for developing therapeutic targets for these diseases, and understanding brain-behaviour relationships. One promising option is to adapt the touchscreen-based trial-unique nonmatching-to-location (TUNL) task that has been shown to be sensitive to hippocampal dysfunction in the rat. This study aims to adapt the TUNL task for use in mice and to test for hippocampus-dependency of the task. TUNL training protocols were altered such that C57BL/6 mice were able to acquire the task. Following acquisition, dysfunction of the dorsal hippocampus (dHp) was induced using a fibre-sparing excitotoxin, and the effects of manipulation of several task parameters were examined. Mice could acquire the TUNL task using training optimised for the mouse (experiments 1). TUNL was found to be sensitive to dHp dysfunction in the mouse (experiments 2, 3 and 4). In addition, we observed that performance of dHp dysfunction group was somewhat consistently lower when sample locations were presented in the centre of the screen. This study opens up the possibility of testing both mouse and rat models on this flexible and hippocampus-sensitive touchscreen task.

Using a principal component analysis of 19 craniofacial landmarks placed on the MR images, we identified a principal component capturing craniofacial features that distinguished females with a presumed differential exposure to prenatal androgens by virtue of having a male (vs. a female) co-twin (Cohen's d = 0.76). Subsequently, we tested the possibility that this craniofacial "signature" of prenatal exposure to androgens predicts brain size, a known sexually dimorphic trait. In an independent sample of female adolescents (singletons; n = 462), we found that the facial signature predicts up to 8 % of variance in brain size. These findings are consistent with the organizational effects of androgens on brain development and suggest that the facial signature derived in this study could complement other indirect measures of prenatal exposure to androgens.

Fifty-one participants took daytime naps (with REM or NREM awakenings) and provided both waking daydream and nap dream reports. They also provided ratings of their bizarreness, sensory experience, and emotion intensity. Recall rates for REM (96%) and NREM (89%) naps were elevated compared to typical recall rates for nighttime dreams (80% and 43% respectively), suggesting an enhanced circadian influence. All attribute ratings were higher for REM than for NREM dreams, replicating findings for nighttime dreams. Compared with daydreams, NREM dreams had lower ratings for emotional intensity and sensory experience while REM dreams had higher ratings for bizarreness and sensory experience. Results support using daytime naps in dream research and suggest that there occurs selective enhancement and inhibition of specific dream attributes by REM, NREM and waking state mechanisms.

The Design, Implementation, and Testing of a Sensorized MRI-Compatible Cello	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Fibre optic sensors; MRI-compatible interface; musical performance gestures	PULSED MAGNETIC-FIELD; VERDET CONSTANT; FUNCTIONAL MRI; MUSIC; PERFORMANCE; BRAIN; PIANISTS; SYSTEMS; IMAGERY; PITCH	The design and testing of optical sensors for a cello compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are presented. The interface is used in neuroimaging experiments, allowing for the first time, the acquisition of cello performance gestures captured inside the MRI scanner. Left-hand fingering and right-hand bowing gestures were captured with optical sensors embedded in the fingerboard, bridge, and bow. Finger-string interaction was sensed through diffuse reflection using plastic optical fibres potted in a 3D-printed fingerboard. Acoustic string vibration was sensed through the transmissive amplitude modulation of an emitting-receiving fibre pair mounted in a specially designed bridge. Bow position and force was transduced with a combination of optical sensors, including optical flow, macrobending loss under compressive strain, and with a three-axis Faraday rotator. The sensors provided sufficient resolution and dynamic range to measure cello gestures inside the MRI scanner, and no interference from the scanner was noted in the acquired signals. Further MRI compatibility testing confirmed that the interface and sensors had no meaningful effect on field homogeneity and no image artifacts were noted. The interface is currently being used in neuroscience experiments.
