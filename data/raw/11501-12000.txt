Techniques measuring electrical changes are commonly used to analyze seizures. Neuronal activity can be also defined by concomitant hemodynamic and metabolic changes. Simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG)-functional MRI (fMRI) measures noninvasively with a high-spatial resolution BOLD changes during seizures in the whole brain. Until now, only a static image representing the whole seizure was provided. We report in 10 focal epilepsy patients a new approach to dynamic imaging of seizures including the BOLD time course of seizures and the identification of brain structures involved in seizure onset and discharge propagation. The first activation was observed in agreement with the expected location of the focus based on clinical and EEG data (three intracranial recordings), thus providing validity to this approach. The BOLD signal preceded ictal EEG changes in two cases. EEG-fMRI may detect changes in smaller and deeper structures than scalp EEG, which can only record activity form Superficial cortical areas. This method allowed us to demonstrate that seizure onset zone was limited to one structure, thus supporting the concept of epileptic focus, but that a complex neuronal network was involved during propagation. Deactivations were also found during seizures, usually appearing after the first activation in areas close or distant to the activated regions. Deactivations may correspond to actively inhibited regions or to functional disconnection from normally active regions. This new noninvasive approach should open the study of seizure generation and propagation mechanisms in the whole brain to groups of patients with focal epilepsies. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3993-4011, 2009.

Reproducibility measures included an overlap ratio with four different thresholds, statistical comparisons of the condition contrasts across sessions (test-retest contrasts), ANCOVAs, and intraclass correlation (ICC) on selected regions of interests (ROIs). In all four conditions and for all reproducibility measures, MCI individuals showed fMRI test-retest reproducibility indices that were comparable to those of healthy older adults. At the group level, the comparison of the test-retest condition contrasts yielded very few differences in the areas and level of activation and those differences tended to show a slight reduction of activation in the second session. In addition, the results from the ANCOVAs showed that the fMRI signal measured at the group level does not vary significantly from one session to another. Overlap ratios, however, showed that the fMRI signal failed to produce a reliable pattern of significantly activated voxels across sessions. ICC analyses on selected ROIs indicated that there is high within-subject variability, suggesting reduced reliability at the individual level. Overall, these findings indicate that MCI individuals show fMRI test-retest reproducibility comparable to those of healthy controls and hence that MCI do not alter fMRI reproducibility. Furthermore, they indicate that monitoring treatment effects is reliable when comparing groups but reduced when comparing single individuals. These results have precise implications for the design of longitudinal studies relying on fMRI measures in older adults. Hum Brain Mapp 30:4033-4047, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In a previous study, we have shown that activity in the anterior cerebellum varies with the rate of learning, with fast learners exhibiting more activity in this region than slow learners. Here, we investigated whether this variability in behavior may partly reflect inter-individual differences in the structural properties of cerebellar white-matter output tracts. For this purpose, we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to estimate fractional anisotropy (FA), and correlated the FA with the rate of adaptation to an optical rotation in 11 subjects. We found that FA in a region consistent with the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), containing fibers connecting the cerebellar cortex with motor and premotor cortex, was positively correlated with the rate of adaptation but not with the general level of performance or the initial deviation. The same pattern was observed in a region of the lateral posterior cerebellum. In contrast, FA in the angular gyrus of the posterior parietal cortex correlated positively both with the rate of adaptation and the overall level of performance. Our results show that the rate of learning a visuomotor task is associated with FA of cerebellar pathways. Hum Brain Mapp 30:4048-4053, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This is the case in all three forms of amblyopia; strabismic, anisometropic, and deprivation. Here we use both a random block design and a phase-encoded design to ascertain (1) the extent to which fMRI activation is reduced at low-mid spatial frequencies in different visual areas, (2) how accurately spatial frequency is mapped across the amblyopic cortex. We report a loss of function to suprathreshold low-medium spatial frequency stimuli that involves more than just area VI, suggesting a diffuse loss in spatial frequency processing in a number of different cortical areas. An analysis of the fidelity of the spatial frequency cortical map reveals that many voxels lose their spatial frequency preference when driven by the amblyopic eye, suggesting a broader tuning for spatial frequency for neurons driven by the amblyopic eye within this low-mid spatial frequency range.

A widely-used test of fluid reasoning and intelligence, the RSPM assays abilities to flexibly infer rules, manage goal hierarchies, and perform high-level abstractions. The neural substrates for these abilities are known to encompass a large frontoparietal network, with different processing models placing variable emphasis on the specific roles of the prefrontal or posterior regions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the neural bases of autistics' RSPM problem solving. Fifteen autistic and eighteen non-autistic participants, matched on age, sex, manual preference and Wechsler IQ, completed 60 self-paced randomly-ordered RSPM items along with a visually similar 60-item Pattern matching comparison task. Accuracy and response times did not differ between groups in the pattern matching task. In the RSPM task, autistics performed with similar accuracy, but with shorter response times, compared to their non-autistic controls. hi both the entire sample and a subsample of participants additionally matched on RSPM performance to control for potential response time confounds, neural activity was similar in both groups for the pattern matching task. However, for the RSPM task, autistics displayed relatively increased task-related activity in extrastriate areas (BA18), and decreased activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) and the medial posterior parietal cortex (BA7). Visual processing mechanisms may therefore play a more prominent role in reasoning in autistics. Hum Brain Mapp 30:4082-4107, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

With the increasingly large data sets being used in brain mapping, there has been a significant rise in the need for accelerating these algorithms. Partial volume estimation (PVE), a brain tissue classification algorithm for MRI, was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based high performance reconfigurable computer using the Mitrion-C high-level language (HLL). This work develops on prior work in which we conducted initial studies on accelerating the prior information estimation algorithm. In this paper, we extend the work to include probability density estimation and present new results and additional analysis. We used several simulated and real human brain MR images to evaluate the accuracy and performance improvement of the proposed algorithm. The FPGA-based probability density estimation and prior information estimation implementation achieved an average speedup over an Itanium 2 CPU of 2.5x and 9.4x, respectively. The overall performance improvement of the FPGA-based PVE algorithm was 5.1x with four FPGAs.

Although AVMs can have various clinical presentations due to their dynamic nature, the most common presenting sign is intracerebral hemorrhage. Whenever an AVM is discovered. the therapeutic choice is often not obvious and It is Influenced not only by the hemodynamic features of the AVM. but also by considerations of the extent of intervention-related morbidity and mortality A patient wall a left frontal AVM is described. He bled three years after gamma knife radiosurgery and developed aphasia. The complete obliteration of the AVM was later achieved by embolization Functional compensatory brain reorganization and plasticity is discussed, since our patient presented with a fast recovery from aphasia and unexpected contralateral redistribution of the speech function and with preference for his second spoken language.

Corticosterone (CORT)-treated rats have emerged as a pharmacological model of depression-like behaviors. Previous studies have shown that CORT administration induces neuronal atrophy in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus and laminae II/III of the prefrontal cortex. However, little attention has been given to other limbic structures such as the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). We investigated here whether 3 weeks of CORT administration in rats causes dendritic remodeling and spine density reorganization in the basolateral amygdala and pyramidal neurons of the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus as well as in spiny medium neurons of NAcc. Quantitative morphological analysis revealed retracted neuronal arborizations and modified configuration of length depending on branch order in medium spiny neurons of the NAcc of CORT-treated animals. Moreover, distal dendritic sections of the NAcc showed massive reductions in the number of spines caused by the CORT treatment. This treatment also induced a reduction in total dendritic length specific to fourth and sixth branch orders of pyramidal CA1 hippocampal neurons. These neurons also showed decreased branching and diminished number of spines. Finally, pyramidal neurons of the basolateral amygdala were apparently not significantly affected by the CORT treatment. Taken together, these data show for the first time neuronal morphological alterations in the NAcc in the CORT model of depression-like behaviors. Our results also add further information about the morphological reorganization occurring in CORT-sensitive regions of the limbic system. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Design: Literature search. Setting: University-affiliated hospital. Measurements: A search was done in the American National Library of Medicine's PUBMED, EMBASE (1980-2007, wk 11), and Medline (from 1950) in March 2007. All complications associated with IVRA were reviewed. Main Results: The lowest dose of local anesthetic associated with a seizure was 1.4 mg/kg for lidocaine; 4 mg/kg for prilocaine, and 1.3 mg/kg for bupivacaine. Cardiac arrests and deaths were reported with lidocaine and bupivacaine only. The lowest dose associated with a cardiac arrest was 2.5 mg/kg for lidocaine and 1.6 mg/kg for bupivacaine. Local anesthetic toxicity occurring during tourniquet inflation has been reported, with tourniquet pressure exceeding initial systolic arterial blood pressure by 150 mmHg. Seizures occurring after tourniquet deflation have been reported with a tourniquet time as long as 60 minutes. Ten cases of compartment syndrome are reported. Conclusion: Seizures have been reported with lidocaine at its lowest effective dose (1.5 mg/kg). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although the cause of hypertension is unknown in most patients, genetic factors are recognized as contributing significantly to an individual's lifetime risk of developing the condition. Here, we investigated the role of the G protein regulator phosducin (Pdc) in hypertension. Mice with a targeted deletion of the gene encoding Pdc (Pdc(-/-) mice) had increased blood pressure despite normal cardiac function and vascular reactivity, and displayed elevated catecholamine turnover in the peripheral sympathetic system. Isolated postganglionic sympathetic neurons from Pdc(-/-) mice showed prolonged action potential firing after stimulation with acetylcholine and increased firing frequencies during membrane depolarization. Furthermore, Pdc(-/-) mice displayed exaggerated increases in blood pressure in response to post-operative stress. Candidate gene-based association studies in 2 different human populations revealed several SNPs in the PDC gene to be associated with stress-dependent blood pressure phenotypes. Individuals homozygous for the G allele of an intronic PDC SNP (rs12402521) had 12-15 mmHg higher blood pressure than those carrying the A allele. These findings demonstrate that PDC is an important modulator of sympathetic activity and blood pressure and may thus represent a promising target for treatment of stress-dependent hypertension.

Lesion Evidence That Two Distinct Regions within Prefrontal Cortex are Critical for n-Back Performance in Humans	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; FRONTAL-LOBE DAMAGE; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; FALSE RECOGNITION; BRAIN ACTIVATION; TASK-DIFFICULTY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Although prefrontal cortex is clearly important in executive function, the specific processes carried out by particular regions within human prefrontal cortex remain a matter of debate. A rapidly growing corpus of functional imaging work now implicates various areas within prefrontal cortex in a wide range of "executive'' tasks. Loss-of-function studies can help constrain the interpretation of such evidence by testing to what extent particular brain areas are necessary for a given cognitive process. Here we apply a component process analysis to understand prefrontal contributions to the n-back task, a widely used test of working memory, in a cohort of patients with focal prefrontal damage. We investigated letter 2-back task performance in 27 patients with focal damage to various regions within prefrontal cortex, compared to 29 demographically matched control subjects. Both "behavior-defined'' approaches, using qualitative lesion analyses and voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping methods, and more conventional "lesion-defined'' groupwise comparisons were undertaken to determine the relationships between specific sites of damage within prefrontal cortex and particular aspects of n-back task performance. We confirmed a critical role for left lateral prefrontal cortex in letter 2-back performance. We also identified a critical role for medial prefrontal cortex in this task: Damage to dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and adjacent dorsal fronto-medial cortex led to a pattern of impairment marked by high false alarm rates, distinct from the impairment associated with lateral prefrontal damage. These findings provide converging support for regionally specific models of human prefrontal function.

Although gain fields have been shown to exist in some cortical and subcortical areas of the brain, their existence has not been explored in the brainstem. In the present modeling study, we develop a physiologically relevant simplified model for the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) to show that gain modulation could also be the underlying mechanism that modifies VOR function with sensorimotor context (i.e. concurrent eye positions and stimulus intensity). The resulting nonlinear model is further extended to generate both slow and quick phases of the VOR. Through simulation of the hybrid nonlinear model we show that disconjugate eye movements during the VOR are an inevitable consequence of the existence of such gain fields in the bilateral VOR pathway. Finally, we will explore the properties of the predicted disconjugate component. We will demonstrate that the apparent phase characteristics of the disconjugate response vary with the concurrent conjugate component.

Materials and methods: This is a prospective, observational study on motor activity of adult patients using wrist actigraphs. Nurses recorded the number of sleep and agitation hours as well as assessed pain and anxiety level (verbal numeric rating) and the agitation/sedation level (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale). Results: Thirteen mechanically ventilated patients were studied during their whole intensive care unit stay (total, 165 patients/d). The number of surveyed movements was gathered for each hour, obtaining an estimation of patient motor status. This measure was different between days and nights (33.3 [20.3-49.0] vs 8.5 [4.4-13.8]; P < .001), with a correlation with sleeping hours estimated by nurses (P = .017 during the days [D], P < .001 during the nights [N]), agitation hours (P = .002 D, P = .0 17 N), Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale value (P < .001 D and N), pain (P = .012 D), and anxiety (P < .001 D) verbal numeric rating. No differences were found using epochs of 15 or 120 seconds. Compliance with patients and nurses was acceptable. Conclusions: Patients' limb movements were significantly related to all studied neurologic status indexes. Continuous actigraphy measuring may become important as a clinical tool both to guide utilization of sedative drugs and to enhance early recognition and management of agitation.

Despite the fact that the cost of storage is dropping, the savings are largely surpassed by the increasing volume of data being generated. While local area network bandwidth within a hospital is adequate for timely access to imaging data, efficiently moving the data between institutions requires wide area network bandwidth, which has a limited availability at a national level. A solution to address those issues is the use of lossy compression as long as there is no loss of relevant information. The goal of this study was to determine levels at which lossy compression can be confidently used in diagnostic imaging applications. In order to provide a fair assessment of existing compression tools, we tested and compared the two most commonly adopted DISCOM compression algorithms: JPEG and JPEG-2000. We conducted an extensive pan-Canadian evaluation of lossy compression applied to seven anatomical areas and five modalities using two recognized techniques: objective methods or diagnostic accuracy and subjective assessment based on Just Noticeable Difference. By incorporating both diagnostic accuracy and subjective evaluation techniques, enabled us to define a range of compression for each modality and body part tested. The results of our study suggest that at low levels of compression, there was no significant difference between the performance of lossy JPEG and lossy JPEG 2000, and that they are both appropriate to use for reporting on medical images. At higher levels, lossy JPEG proved to be more effective than JPEG 2000 in some cases, mainly neuro CT. More evaluation is required to assess the effect of compression on thin slice CT. We provide a table of recommended compression ratios for each modality and anatomical area investigated, to be integrated in the Canadian Association of Radiologists standard for the use of lossy compression in medical imaging.

To determine whether Casp-6 is also activated in familial AD, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of active Casp-6 and Tau cleaved by Casp-6 in temporal cortex and hippocampal tissue sections from cases of familial AD. The cases included 5 carrying the amyloid precursor protein K670N and M671L Swedish mutation, I carrying the amyloid precursor protein E693G Arctic mutation, 2 each carrying the Presenilin 1 M146V, F105L, A431E, V261F, and Y115C mutations, and I with the Presenilin I I N 1411 mutation. Active Casp-6 immunoreactivity was found in all cases. Caspase-6 immunoreactivity was observed in neuritic plaques or in some cases cotton-wool plaques, and in neuropil threads and neurofibrillary tangles. These results indicate that Casp-6 is activated in familial forms of AD, as previously observed in sporadic forms. Because sporadic and familial AD cases have similar pathological features, these results support a fundamental role of Casp-6 in the pathophysiology of both familial and sporadic AD.

Elevated proNGF and reduced levels of the TrkA high-affinity NGF receptor occur in prodromal and advanced stages of AD. We recently described a protease cascade responsible for the conversion of proNGF to mature NGF (mNGF) in which matrix metal loproteinase 9 (MMP-9) degrades mNGF in the extracellular space. To determine whether this proteolytic cascade is altered during the progression of AD, we examined human frontal and parietal cortex tissues from aged subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD, mild cognitive impairment, or no cognitive impairment. The analysis demonstrated greater MMP-9 activity in both AD and mild cognitive impairment compared with no cognitive impairment brain samples (p < 0.01), which supports the notion that a metabolic failure in the NGF-maturation/degradation pathway may be associated with an exacerbated degradation of mNGF in the cerebral cortex in early AD. Moreover, there were inverse correlations between Global Cognitive Score and Mini-Mental State Examination score and MMP-9 activity. These findings suggest that a reduction in mNGF as a consequence of MMP-9-mediated degradation may in part underlie the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits in mild cognitive impairment and AD.

Differences in the time course of short-term depression across receptive fields are correlated with directional selectivity in electrosensory neurons. J Neurophysiol 102: 3270-3279, 2009. First published September 30, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00645.2009. Directional selectivity, in which neurons respond preferentially to one direction of movement ("preferred") over the opposite direction ("null"), is a critical computation that is found in the nervous systems of many animals. Here we show the first experimental evidence for a correlation between differences in short-term depression and direction-selective responses to moving objects. As predicted by quantitative models, the observed differences in the time courses of short-term depression at different locations within receptive fields were correlated with measures of direction selectivity in awake, behaving weakly electric fish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus). Because short-term depression is ubiquitous in the central nervous systems of vertebrate animals, it may be a common mechanism used for the generation of directional selectivity and other spatiotemporal computations.

This study reexamined the perceptual equivalence of active and passive touch using a computer-controlled force-feedback device. Nine subjects explored a 6 x 10-cm workspace, with the index finger resting on a mobile flat plate, and experienced simulated Gaussian ridges and troughs (width, 15 mm; amplitude, 0.5 to 4.5 mm). The device simulated shapes by modulating either lateral resistance with no vertical movement or by vertical movement with no lateral forces, as a function of the digit position in the horizontal workspace. The force profiles and displacements recorded during active touch were played back to the stationary finger in the passive condition, ensuring that stimulation conditions were identical. For the passive condition, shapes simulated by vertical displacements of the finger had lower categorization thresholds and higher magnitude estimates compared with those of active touch. In contrast, the results with the lateral force fields showed that with passive touch, subjects recognized that a stimulus was present but were unable to correctly categorize its shape as convex or concave. This result suggests that feedback from the motor command can play an important role in processing sensory inputs during tactile exploration. Finally, subjects were administered a ring-block anesthesia of the digital nerves of the index finger and subsequently retested. Removing skin sensation significantly increased the categorization threshold for the perception of shapes generated by lateral force fields, but not for those generated by displacement fields.

The purpose of the current review is to compare the results provided by the different assessment tools used in the scientific literature in order to gain a better understanding of the sequelae and recovery following a concussion. Until recently, the bulk of the has literature focused on the immediate outcome in the hours and days post-injury as a means to plan the safest return-to-play strategy. This has led to the development of several assessment batteries that are relatively easy and rapid to administer and that allow for multiple testing sessions. The main conclusion derived from that literature is that cognitive symptoms tend to resolve within 1 week. However, accumulating evidence indicates that cognitive testing should be viewed as one of several complementary tools necessary for a comprehensive assessment of concussion. Including an objective measure of postural stability increases the sensitivity of the return-to-play decision-making process and minimizes the consequences of mitigating factors (e.g., practice effects and motivation) on neuropsychological test results. This is consistent with findings that symptom severity, neuropsychological function, and postural stability do not appear to be related or affected to the same degree after a concussion. Furthermore, recent evidence from brain imaging, including event-related potentials and functional and metabolic imaging, suggest abnormalities in the electrical responses, metabolic balance, and oxygen consumption of neurons that persist several months after the incident. We explain this apparent discrepancy in recovery by suggesting an initial and rapid phase of functional recovery driven by compensatory mechanisms and brain plasticity, which is followed by a prolonged neuronal recovery period during which subtle deficits in brain functioning are present but not apparent to standard clinical assessment tools.

J	Fenneteau, F; Li, J; Nekka, F				Fenneteau, Frederique; Li, Jun; Nekka, Fahima			Assessing drug distribution in tissues expressing P-glycoprotein using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling: identification of important model parameters through global sensitivity analysis	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS			English	Article						PBPK; GSA; Model parameters correlation; PRCC; Brain; Heart; Transporters	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; COMPUTER-MODELS; INTRAVENOUS DOMPERIDONE; IN-VIVO; DISPOSITION; TRANSPORT; PREDICTION; RATS; VARIABILITY	The structural complexity of a PBPK model is usually accompanied with significant uncertainty in estimating its input parameters. In the last decade, the global sensitivity analysis, which accounts for the variability of all model input parameters simultaneously as well as their correlations, has gained a wide attention as a powerful probing technique to identify and control biological model uncertainties. However, the current sensitivity analysis techniques used in PBPK modeling often neglect the correlation between these input parameters. We introduce a new strategy in the PBPK modeling field to investigate how the uncertainty and variability of correlated input parameters influence the outcomes of the drug distribution process based on a model we recently developed to explain and predict drug distribution in tissues expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp). As direct results, we will also identify the most important input parameters having the largest contribution to the variability and uncertainty of model outcomes. We combined multivariate random sampling with a ranking procedure. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed on the PBPK model with eighteen model input parameters. Log-normal distributions were assumed for these parameters according to literature and their reported correlations were also included. A multivariate sensitivity analysis was then performed to identify the input parameters with the greatest influence on model predictions. The partial rank correlation coefficients (PRCC) were calculated to establish the input-output relationships. A moderate variability of predicted C-last and C-max was observed in liver, heart and brain tissues in the presence or absence of P-gp activity. The major statistical difference in model outcomes of the predicted median values has been obtained in brain tissue. PRCC calculation confirmed the importance for a better quantitative characterisation of input parameters related to the passive diffusion and active transport of the unbound drug through the blood-tissue membrane in heart and brain. This approach has also identified as important input parameters those related to the drug metabolism for the prediction of model outcomes in liver and plasma. The proposed Monte-Carlo/PRCC approach was aimed to address the effect of input parameters correlation in a PBPK model. It allowed the identification of important input parameters that require additional attention in research for strengthening the physiological knowledge of drug distribution in mammalian tissues expressing P-gp, thereby reducing the uncertainty of model predictions.

Many approaches have been used to generate fMRI simulations, but there is currently no generic framework to assess how realistic each one of these approaches may be. In this article, a statistical technique called parametric bootstrap was used to generate a simulation database that mimicked the parameters found in a real database, which comprised 40 subjects and five tasks. The simulations were evaluated by comparing the distributions of a battery of statistical measures between the real and simulated databases. Two Popular simulation models were evaluated for the first time by applying the bootstrap framework. The first model was an additive mixture of Multiple components and the second one implemented a non-linear motion process. In both models, the simulated components included the following brain dynamics: a baseline, physiological noise, neural activation and random noise. These models were found to successfully reproduce the relative variance of the components and the temporal autocorrelation of the fMRI time series. By contrast, the level of spatial autocorrelation was found to be drastically low using the additive model. Interestingly, the motion process in the second model intrisically generated sonic slow time drifts and increased the level of spatial autocorrelations. These experiments demonstrated that the bootstrap framework is a powerful new tool that can pinpoint the respective strengths and limitations of simulation models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This model was used to gain insight into the observations from multicomponent quantitative T-2 relaxometry and quantitative magnetization transfer imaging, both based on simplified white matter models and experimentally feasible in vivo. Using a set of coupled Bloch equations describing the behavior of the magnetization in a four-pool model of white matter, simulations of the quantitative T-2 relaxometry and quantitative magnetization transfer imaging techniques were performed. pathology-inspired modifications were made to the four-pool model to gauge their impact on quantitative T-2 relaxometry and quantitative magnetization transfer imaging observations. Our results show that changes in the rate of water movement between microanatomic compartments may impact otherwise stable quantitative T-2 relaxometry observations; that the measure of the quantitative magnetization transfer imaging-based semisolid pool population is robust, despite the presence of two distinct semisolid components; and that quantitative magnetization transfer imaging compartment size estimates are not influenced by changes in the T-2 of the intra/extracellular water pool. The four-pool model, while impractical for in vivo characterization, yields important insight into the interpretation of changes observed with these quantitative MRI methods based on simplified models of white matter.

Inhibition of Y-box binding protein-1 slows the growth of glioblastoma multiforme and sensitizes to temozolomide independent O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase	MOLECULAR CANCER THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT PHENOTYPE; BREAST-CANCER CELLS; PEDIATRIC GLIOBLASTOMA; ONCOLYTIC ADENOVIRUS; MALIGNANT GLIOMA; TARGETING YB-1; UP-REGULATION; GENE; DNA; EXPRESSION	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive type of brain tumor where < 3% of newly diagnosed cases in the patients will survive >5 years. In adults, GBM is the most common type of brain tumor. It is rarer in children, where it constitutes similar to 15% of all brain tumors diagnosed. These tumors are often invasive, making surgical resection difficult. Further, they can be refractory to current therapies such as temozolomide. The current dogma is that temozolomide resistance rests on the expression of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) because it cleaves methylated DNA adducts formed by the drug. Our laboratory recently reported that another drug resistance gene known as the Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is highly expressed in primary GBM but not in normal brain tissues based on the evaluation of primary tumors. We therefore questioned whether GBM depend on YB-1 for growth and/or response to temozolomide. Herein, we report that YB-1 inhibition reduced tumor cell invasion and growth in monolayer as well as in soft agar. Moreover, blocking this protein ultimately delayed tumor onset in mice. Importantly, inhibiting YB-1 enhanced temozolomide sensitivity in a manner that was independent of MGMT in models of adult and pediatric GBM. In conclusion, inhibiting YB-1 may be a novel way to improve the treatment of GBM.

At the site of injury, glial cells conspire with an inhibitory biochemical milieu to construct both physical and chemical barriers that prevent the outgrowth of axons to or beyond the lesion site. These inhibitors include factors derived from myelin, repulsive guidance cues, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Each bind receptors on the axon surface to initiating intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately result in cytoskeletal reorganization and growth cone collapse. Here, we present an overview of the molecules, receptors, and signaling pathways that inhibit CNS regeneration, with a particular focus on the intracellular signaling machinery that may function as convergent targets for multiple inhibitory ligands.

Alterations in any of the normal parameters of serotonergic neurotransmission can produce several different psychiatric disorders, including major depression. In many instances, brain neurochemical variables are not able to be studied properly in humans, thus making the use of good animal models extremely valuable. One of these animal models is the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) of rats, which has face, predictive and constructive validities in relation to human depression. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of the tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activation inhibitor, AGN-2979, on the FSL rats (rats with depression-like behaviour), and compare it to the effect on the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) of rats used as the control rats. The effect was evaluated by measuring changes in regional serotonin synthesis in the vehicle treated rats (FSL-VEH and FRL-VEH) relative to those measured in the AGN-2979 treated rats (FSL-AGN and FRL-AGN). Regional serotonin synthesis was measured autoradiographically in more than 30 brain regions. The measurements were performed using alpha-[(14)C]methyl-L-tryptophan as the tracer. The results indicate that AGN-2979 did not produce a significant reduction of TPH activity in the AGN-2979 group relative to the vehicle group (a reduction would have been observed if there had been an activation of TPH by the experimental setup) in the FSL rats. On the other hand, there was a highly significant reduction of synthesis in the FRL rats treated by AGN-2979, relative to the vehicle group. Together, the results demonstrate that in the FSL rats, AGN-2979 does not affect serotonin synthesis. This suggests that there was no activation of TPH in the FSL rats during the experimental procedure, but such activation did occur in the FRL rats. Because of this finding, it could be hypothesized that TPH in the FSL rats cannot be easily activated. This may contribute to the development of depressive-like symptoms in the FSL rats ("depressed" rats), as they cannot easily modulate their need for elevated amounts of this neurotransmitter, and possibly other neurotransmitters. Further, because these rats represent a very good model of human depression, one can hypothesize that humans who do not have readily activated TPH may be more prone to develop depression.

Minocycline attenuates oxidative/nitrosative stress and cerebral complications of acute liver failure in rats	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Hepatic encephalopathy; Acute liver failure; Nitric oxide synthase; Oxidative stress; Brain edema; Minocycline	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; AMMONIA INTOXICATION; BRAIN EDEMA; ENCEPHALOPATHY; RADICALS; CORTEX	In the present study, the effects of minocycline on progression of encephalopathy and brain edema in rats with acute liver failure (ALF) resulting from hepatic devascularization were studied in relation to the antioxidant action of the drug. ALF rats were sacrificed at precoma and coma stages of encephalopathy along with their appropriate sham-operated controls. Minocycline-treated ALF rats were sacrificed in parallel with comatose vehicle-treated ALF controls. Microglial activation was assessed using CD11b/c (OX-42) immunohistochemistry. Nitrite/nitrate levels in plasma and brain were measured using the Griess reaction. Expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were measured using real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. Increased nitrite/nitrate levels were observed in the plasma of ALF rats at coma stage of encephalopathy compared to sham-operated controls. increased expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein was observed in the frontal cortex of ALF rats at both precoma and coma stages of encephalopathy. Significant increases in expression of endothelial (eNOS) and inducible (iNOS) isoforms of NOS mRNA and protein occurred only at coma stages of encephalopathy accompanied by increased brain nitrite/nitrate concentrations. As expected, minocycline attenuated microglial activation as confirmed by decreased OX-42 immunoreactivity, normalized nitrite/nitrate levels in brain and significantly attenuated HO-1, eNOS and iNOS expression. These results indicate that the beneficial effect of minocycline on the neurological complications of ALF is mediated, at least in part, by reduction of oxidative/nitrosative stress.

J	Kanemaru, K; Diksic, M				Kanemaru, Kazuya; Diksic, Mirko			The Flinders Sensitive Line of rats, a rat model of depression, has elevated brain glucose utilization when compared to normal rats and the Flinders Resistant Line of rats	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Depression model; Autoradiography; Imaging; Naive rats	CHRONIC ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT; SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY PET; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; 5-HT SYNTHESIS; ANIMAL-MODEL; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MOOD DISORDERS; ACID LEVELS; IN-VIVO	The Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) of rats, developed as a line of rats with behavioral supersensitivity to diisopropyl fluorophosphates, a cholinesterase inhibitor, has been used as a rat model of depression. This line has many behavioral and neurochemical similarities to human depression. Because brain regional glucose utilization has been extensively studied in patients with depression with a rather heterogeneous outcome, it became necessary to evaluate this parameter in a well defined and homogeneous animal model. In the present study, the regional glucose utilization measured in thirty-six distinct brain regions and the pineal body was determined in FSL rats and the values were compared to those found in normal Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats and the Flinders Resistant Line of rats (FRL: animals which have a high resistance to the above noted cholinesterase inhibitor). The measurements were performed by autoradiography with 2-[(14)C]deoxyglucose (2-DG) as the tracer. SPD and FRL groups consisted of six and FSL had 8 rats. The rats were sacrificed 45 min following the start of the tracer injection. The results showed that the global, and, in many brain areas, regional, glucose utilization is higher in the FSL rats than in the control SPD rats. The synthesis in the FRL rats was very similar to that of the SPD rats, but it was different in many brain regions from the FSL rats. Because the FSL rats have many neurochemical and behavioral differences, in particular, those parameters having lower values, the results presented here suggest that the biochemical processes in the brain of FSL rats occur with lower efficiency than in either the normal SPD rats or FRL rats.

Regional brain metabolism was analyzed by cytochrome c oxidase (COX) histochemistry in PS1-A246E mouse mutants, a model of autosomal dominant AD overexpressing beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide without amyloidosis or cell degeneration. Immunohistochemical samples were analyzed on adjacent sections for regional A beta 1-42 levels, as well as DNA oxidative damage with 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). COX activity increased in the basal forebrain nuclear complex, specific parts of the amygdala and hippocampus, as well as in striatum and connected regions. On the contrary, a hypometabolism was observed in midline thalamic, interpeduncular, and pedonculopontine nuclei. The integration of these regions in circuitries subserving emotions, arousal, and cognitive functions may explain why neurochemical alterations in specific brain regions were linearly correlated with psychomotor slowing and disinhibition previously reported in the mutant. As the PS1-A246E model appears to mimick prodromal AD, the results support the existence of mitochondrial abnormalities prior to AD-related cognitive deficits. However, since affected PS1-A246E brain regions were not primarily those altered in AD-associated histopathological features and did not systematically display either A beta overexpression or higher 8-OHdG immunolabelling, the hypermetabolism observed seems to comprise a compensatory reaction to early mitochondrial abnormalities; furthermore, neuronal synaptic function should be considered as particularly relevant in COX activity changes.

Profiles of Neurological Outcome Prediction Among Intensivists	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Prognosis; Coma; Critical care; Ethics; Neurology; Neuroethics	LIFE-SUPPORT; CARE-UNIT; CRITICALLY-ILL; HEALTH-CARE; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; MEDICAL LITERATURE; USERS GUIDES; END; CERTAINTY; DECISION	Advances in intensive care medicine have increased survival rates of patients with critical neurological conditions. The focus of prognostication for such patients is therefore shifting from predicting chances of survival to meaningful neurological recovery. This study assessed the variability in long-term outcome predictions among physicians and aimed to identify factors that may account for this variability. Based on a clinical vignette describing a comatose patient suffering from post-anoxic brain injury intensivists were asked in a semi-structured interview about the patient's specific neurological prognosis and about prognostication in general. Qualitative research methods were used to identify areas of variability in prognostication and to classify physicians according to specific prognostication profiles. Quantitative statistics were used to assess for associations between prognostication profiles and physicians' demographic and practice characteristics. Eighteen intensivists participated. Functional outcome predictions varied along an evaluative dimension (fair/good-poor) and a confidence dimension (certain-uncertain). More experienced physicians tended to be more pessimistic about the patient's functional outcome and more certain of their prognosis. Attitudes toward quality of life varied along an evaluative dimension (good-poor) and a "style" dimension (objective-subjective). Older and more experienced physicians were more likely to express objective judgments of quality of life and to predict a worse quality of life for the patient than their younger and less experienced counterparts. Various prognostication profiles exist among intensivists. These may be dictated by factors such as physicians' age and clinical experience. Awareness of these associations may be a first step to more uniform prognostication.

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate improves cholestasis-associated fatigue in bile duct ligated rats	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						bile duct ligation; cholestasis; cirrhosis; dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate; fatigue; neuroactive steroids	PRIMARY BILIARY-CIRRHOSIS; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; RECEPTOR; NEUROSTEROIDS; STEROIDS; BRAIN; DHEA; INHIBITION; DEPRESSION; SEVERITY	Fatigue is a common debilitating symptom in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The mechanism of fatigue is still poorly understood. However, it has been reported that levels of the steroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) are reduced in plasma of patients with PBC, and substitutive therapy has been suggested to improve fatigue symptoms experienced during the course of this disease. In this study, we tested the effect of DHEAS on whole body fatigue in rats following bile duct ligation (BDL). Fatigue was estimated by the time spent on an electrified grid as a result of falling off a treadmill and by performance of rats on an infrared beam monitor which allows the assessment of travelled distance and stereotypic movement activities. On day 5 after BDL surgery, cholestatic rats exhibited increased whole body fatigue as reflected by significantly increased time spent on the electrified grid, reduced travelled distance and reduced stereotypic movements. Administration of 5 mg kg-1 of DHEAS to BDL rats for three consecutive days significantly normalized their behaviour. Fatigue scores were also found to be reduced in cirrhotic rats 4 weeks after BDL surgery, and DHEAS treatment for 3 days reduced fatigue scores at this stage. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate treatment was sufficient to increase brain levels of DHEAS in the BDL rats in a manner that is significantly and highly correlated with those of plasma DHEAS and brain dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Substitutive therapies with DHEAS or DHEA could represent novel approaches in the management of fatigue due to cholestasis-induced liver failure.

Studying this trait helps to learn about mechanisms of epileptogenicity. While simultaneous recordings of EEG and functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) in patients with spontaneous generalised spike-wave discharges (GSW) have revealed activation of the thalamus and deactivation in frontoparietal areas, EEG-fMRI studies on evoked GSW such as PPR are lacking. In this EEG-fMRI study, 30 subjects with reported generalised PPR underwent intermittent photic stimulation (IPS) in a 3 T MR scanner. PPR was elicited in 6 subjects, four diagnosed with idiopathic generalised epilepsy and two with tension-type headache. Because PPR is preceded by synchronization of cortical gamma oscillations, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes were analysed at the onset of the PPR (standard regressor) and 3 s before the onset of PPR (early regressor) in one model. In all subjects, IPS led to a significant activation of the visual cortex. Based on the early regressor, PPR associated activation was found in the parietal cortex adjacent to the intraparietal sulcus in five and in the premotor cortex in all 6 subjects. The standard regressor revealed deactivation in early activated areas in all subjects and thalamic activation in one subject. In contrast to spontaneous GSW, these results suggest that PPR is a cortical phenomenon with an involvement of the parietal and frontal cortices. Pronounced haemodynamic changes seen with the early regressor could mirror gamma activity that is known to precede PPR. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We investigated the role of vision in the effective development of audiotactile interactions in peripersonal space. Early blind (EB), late blind (LB) and sighted control (SC) participants were asked to lateralize auditory, tactile and audiotactile stimuli. The experiment was conducted with the hands uncrossed or crossed over the body midline in order to alter the relationship between personal and peripersonal spatial representations. First, we observed that the crossed posture results in a greater detrimental effect for tactile performance in sighted subjects but a greater deficit in auditory performance in early blind ones. This result is interpreted as evidence for a visually driven developmental process that automatically remaps tactile and proprioceptive spatial representation into an external framework. Second, we demonstrate that improved reaction times observed in the bimodal conditions in SC and LB exceeds that predicted by probability summation in both conditions of postures, indicating neural integration of different sensory information. In EB, nonlinear summation was obtained in the uncrossed but not in the crossed posture. We argue that the default use of an anatomically anchored reference system in EB prevents effective audiotactile interactions in the crossed posture due to the poorly aligned spatial coordinates of these two modalities in such conditions. Altogether, these results provide compelling evidence for the critical role of early vision in the development of multisensory perception and action control in peripersonal space.

Currently, this relationship is widely assumed to be characterized by Grubb's power-law, derived from primate data, where the power coefficient (alpha) was found to be 0.38. The validity of this general formulation has been examined previously, and an alpha of 0.38 has been frequently cited when calculating the cerebral oxygen metabolism change (Delta CMRo(2)) using calibrated BOLD. However, the direct use of this relationship has been the subject of some debate, since it is well established that the BOLD signal is primarily modulated by changes in 'venous' CBV (Delta CBV(v), comprising deoxygenated blood in the capillary, venular, and to a lesser extent, in the arteriolar compartments) instead of total CBV, and yet Delta CBV(v) measurements in humans have been extremely scarce. In this work, we demonstrate reproducible Delta CBV(v) measurements at 3 T using venous refocusing for the volume estimation (VERVE) technique, and report on steady-state Delta CBV(v) and ACBF measurements in human subjects undergoing graded visual and sensorimotor stimulation. We found that: (1) a BOLD-specific flow-volume power-law relationship is described by alpha = 0.23 +/- 0.05, significantly lower than Grubb's constant of 0.38 for total CBV, (2) this power-law constant was not found to vary significantly between the visual and sensorimotor areas; and (3) the use of Grubb's value of 0.38 in gradient-echo BOLD modeling results in an underestimation of Delta CMRo(2).

All children with term intrapartum asphyxia encountered in a single pediatric neurologic practice with at least 2 years of follow-up and an abnormal neurologic outcome were identified. Abnormal outcomes were grouped into those with or without cerebral palsy. A total of 40 children (28 male, 12 female) met study criteria. Of these, 23 developed cerebral palsy; the remaining 17 children developed an abnormal neurologic outcome that did not include cerebral palsy. A more severe grade of neonatal encephalopathy, a higher number of neonatal seizures, the neonatal use of phenytoin, diffuse abnormalities on imaging, and abnormal findings on neurologic examination at neonatal discharge were all significantly (P<0.05) associated with an abnormal outcome that included cerebral palsy. Abnormal neurologic outcomes other than cerebral palsy subsequent to term intrapartum asphyxia may occur. It appears that a more severe grade of apparent initial clinical injury is more likely to result in an outcome featuring cerebral palsy. (C) 2009 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

More specifically, Gro/TLE1 participates in mechanisms that inhibit/delay the differentiation of cerebral cortex neural progenitor cells into neurons during mammalian forebrain development. The anti-neurogenic function of Gro/TLE1 depends on the formation of protein complexes with specific DNA-binding transcription factors that engage Gro/TLE1 through WRP(W/Y) sequences. Interaction with those transcription partners results in Gro/TLE1 recruitment to selected DNA sites and causes increased Gro/TLE1 phosphorylation. The physiological significance of the latter event, termed "cofactor-activated phosphorylation," had not been determined. Therefore, this study aimed at clarifying the role of cofactor-activated phosphorylation in the anti-neurogenic function of Gro/TLE1. Methods and Principal Findings: A combination of site-directed mutagenesis, mass spectrometry, biochemistry, primary cell culture, and immunocytochemical assays was utilized to characterize point mutations of Ser-286, a residue that is phosphorylated in vivo and is located within the serine/proline-rich (SP) domain of Gro/TLE1. Mutation of Ser-286 to alanine or glutamic acid does not perturb the interaction of Gro/TLE1 with DNA-binding partners, including the basic helix-loophelix transcription factor Hes1, a prototypical anti-neurogenic WRP(W/Y) motif protein. Ser-286 mutations do not prevent the recruitment of Gro/TLE1 to DNA, but they impair cofactor-activated phosphorylation and weaken the interaction of Gro/TLE1 with chromatin. These effects are correlated with an impairment of the anti-neurogenic activity of Gro/TLE1. Similar results were obtained when mutations of Ser-289 and Ser-298, which are also located within the SP domain of Gro/TLE1, were analyzed. Conclusion: Based on the positive correlation between Gro/TLE1 cofactor-activated phosphorylation and ability to inhibit cortical neuron differentiation, we propose that hyperphosphorylation induced by cofactor binding plays a positive role in the regulation of Gro/TLE1 anti-neurogenic activity.

Auditory plasticity and speech motor learning	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						sensorimotor adaptation; speech perception; speech production	PERCEPTION; CORTEX; SOUND; DISCRIMINATION; DISTINCTNESS; DYNAMICS; HEARING; VOWELS; TOUCH	Is plasticity in sensory and motor systems linked? Here, in the context of speech motor learning and perception, we test the idea sensory function is modified by motor learning and, in particular, that speech motor learning affects a speaker's auditory map. We assessed speech motor learning by using a robotic device that displaced the jaw and selectively altered somatosensory feedback during speech. We found that with practice speakers progressively corrected for the mechanical perturbation and after motor learning they also showed systematic changes in their perceptual classification of speech sounds. The perceptual shift was tied to motor learning. Individuals that displayed greater amounts of learning also showed greater perceptual change. Perceptual change was not observed in control subjects that produced the same movements, but in the absence of a force field, nor in subjects that experienced the force field but failed to adapt to the mechanical load. The perceptual effects observed here indicate the involvement of the somatosensory system in the neural processing of speech sounds and suggest that speech motor learning results in changes to auditory perceptual function.

The Autonomy Over Smoking Scale was produced through a process involving item generation, focus-group evaluation, testing in adults to winnow items, field testing with adults and adolescents, and head-to-head comparisons with other measures. The final 12-item scale shows excellent reliability (alpha s = .91-97), with a one-factor solution explaining 59% of the variance in adults and 61%-74% of the variance in adolescents. Concurrent validity was supported by associations with age of smoking initiation, lifetime use, smoking frequency, daily cigarette consumption, history of failed cessation, Hooked on Nicotine Checklist scores, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (4th ed., text rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) nicotine dependence criteria. Potentially useful features of this new instrument include (a) it assesses tobacco withdrawal, cue-induced craving, and psychological dependence on cigarettes; (b) it measures symptom intensity; and (c) it asks about current symptoms only, so it could be administered to quitting smokers to track the resolution of symptoms.

Target-distractor interference in the attentional blink implicates the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Article							SUPPRESSION	We provide evidence that the locus coeruleus-norephinephrine (LC-NE) system is the neurophysiological basis of the attentional blink. The attentional blink refers to decreased accuracy for reporting the second of two targets in a rapid serial visual presentation of distractors. The LC-NE account of the attentional blink posits that targets elicit a facilitative LC-NE system response that is available for the first target but subsequently unavailable to the second, due to the autoinhibitory nature of the LC-NE system. We propose a modification of the LC-NE account, suggesting that the LC-NE system response is elicited by interference between mutually exclusive responses demanded by temporally proximal targets and distractors. We increased the interference between the first target and the following distractor by reducing the time between them. For identifying the second target this high-interference condition yielded a benefit up to 200 msec after onset of the first, followed by a decrease in accuracy. Consistent with our modification of the LC-NE account, this result suggests a temporarily enhanced LC-NE system response to increased target-distractor interference.

To assess the changes in regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCGU) following chronic treatment with citalopram in OBX and sham-operated rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats (160-190 g) were used. Two weeks following the surgeries, the rats were implanted with osmotic minipumps which delivered 10 mg/kg/day of citalopram (the sham-CTP and OBX-CTP groups) or saline (to the sham-SAL and OBX-SAL groups) for 2 weeks. Following the treatment, the rates of rCGU were determined in 43 brain regions using 2-[C-14]deoxyglucose (2-[C-14]DG) autoradiography. The general linear model statistical analysis revealed significantly lower rCGU in the OBX-SAL group compared to the sham-SAL group in the medial prefrontal cortex and the median forebrain bundle. The sham-CTP group had significantly lower rCGU relative to the sham-SAL group in the medial prefrontal cortex. The OBX-CTP group had significantly lower rCGU than the OBX-SAL group in the anterior olfactory nucleus, orbitofrontal cortex, frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, visual cortex, and substantia nigra-pars reticulata. The rCGU in the OBX-CTP group was significantly lower than that in the sham-CTP group in the anterior olfactory nucleus, orbitofrontal cortex, visual cortex, and substantia nigra-pars reticulata. The results imply that chronic citalopram treatment, shown previously to result in behavioral normalization in OBX rats, establishes a new pattern of rCGU, rather than normalizing it to the pattern of the sham-CTP rats.

Manganese exposure and the neuropsychological effect on children and adolescents: a review	REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						Manganese; neurobehavioral manifestations; cognition; neurotoxicity	INTELLECTUAL FUNCTION; INFANT FORMULAS; NEUROTOXICITY; HAIR; WATER; BANGLADESH; ARAIHAZAR; DOPAMINE; TOXICITY; PROPOSAL	Objectives. Manganese (Mn) is an essential element, but overexposure can have neurotoxic effects. Methods. In this article, we review and summarize studies on exposure to Mn and nervous system impairments in children. Results. We identified 12 original articles published between 1977 and 2007. Overexposure to Mn was suspected to occur through diverse sources: infant milk formula, drinking water, industrial pollution, and mining wastes. The most common bioindicator of exposure to Mn was hair Mn content, but some studies measured Mn in blood, urine, or dentin; one study on prenatal exposure measured Mn content in cord blood. Most studies indicate that higher postnatal exposure to Mn is associated with poorer cognitive functions and hyperactive behavior. Conclusions. The limitations of the existing studies are numerous: most were cross-sectional, had a modest sample size, and lacked adjustment for important confounders. Future investigations should be performed on a larger sample size and include a more detailed exposure assessment, addressing multiple sources of exposure such as food, water, and airborne particulates.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and socio-demographic factors associated with VPA response in newly diagnosed childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and to determine if these factors also influence the chances of achieving long-term seizure freedom. Methods: Medical charts of 180 children with CAE were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, electro-encephalographic and imaging findings were recorded to correlate with complete VPA response and long-term epilepsy outcome. Factors associated with non-responsiveness were identified individually and in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: Treatment Was Successful in 112 (58.3%) children. More children that were non-responsive to VPA experienced generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) (33.8% vs. 13.4% for responders; p = 0.001) and 52.9% had a pre-treatment seizure frequency greater than 10/day (vs. 27.0% for responders; p < 0.001). Finally, responders were older at time of diagnosis versus non-responders (p = 0.001). Absence of long-term seizure freedom was linked to the presence of GTCS, the absence of initial response and the need for multiple AEDs to control seizures. Interpretation: Our results suggest that clinical phenotypes are associated with reduced response rates to VPA. This should be taken into account when counselling families of children with newly diagnosed absence epilepsy. (C) 2009 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Deep brain stimulation may also be effective in treating a number of psychiatric disorders, including treatment refractory depression and OCD. Although DBS is a widely accepted therapy in motor disorders, it remains an invasive and expensive procedure. The ethical and social challenges of DBS need further examination, and discussion and emerging applications of DBS in psychiatry may also complicate the ethical landscape of DBS. Methods: To identify and characterize current and emerging issues in the use of DBS, we reviewed the neurosurgical literature on DBS as well as the interdisciplinary medical ethics and relevant psychological and sociological literatures. We also consulted the USPTO database, FDA regulations and report decisions, and the business reports of key DBS manufacturers. Results: Important ethical and social challenges exist in the current and extending practice of DBS, notably in patient selection, informed consent, resource allocation, and in public understanding. These challenges are likely to be amplified if emerging uses of DBS in psychiatry are approved. Conclusions: Our review of ethical and social issues related to DBS highlights that several significant challenges, although not insurmountable, need much closer attention. A combination of approaches previously used in neuroethics, such as expert consensus workshops to establish ethical guidelines and public engagement to improve public understanding, may be fruitful to explore.

Altered Expression and Alpha-1 Adrenergic Receptor Mediated Activity of Protein Kinase C in the Prefrontal Cortex of Rats With Neonatal Ventral Hippocampus Lesions	SYNAPSE			English	Article						schizophrenia; animal model; neurodevelopment; norepinephrine; signal transudation	POST-PUBERTAL RATS; WORKING-MEMORY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; MESSENGER-RNA; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; EXCITOTOXIC LESIONS; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; POSTPUBERTAL RATS; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; POSTMORTEM BRAIN	The neonatal ventral hippocampus (nVH) lesion in rats captures many features of schizophrenia at the levels of behavior and neurobiological markers. We have previously reported enhanced expression of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (AR) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of postpubertal nVH-lesioned rats and proposed that enhanced alpha-1 AR signaling might participate ill some of the behavioral abnormalities observed in the nVH-lesioned rats. To assess the components of alpha-1 adrenergic signaling in nVH-lesiond rats, we examined prefrontal cortical expression of protein kinase C (PKC) subtypes by Western blotting and alpha-1 AR-stimulated PKC activity by in vitro enzyme assay in Postpubertal animals. Neonatal VH-lesioned animals showed significantly increased expression of membrane-bound PKC-alpha and the phosphorylated form of PKC. Cytosolic PKC-beta II and PKC-gamma expression were found to be decreased in the PFC of lesioned animals with no change in the expression of PKC-beta I either in the cytosol or membrane. PKC activity assays showed an increase in basal PKC activity in the PFC slices of nVH-lesioned animals. Stimulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor with different concentrations of the agonist phenylephrine (PE), while increasing PKC activity in the sham-lesioned animals surprisingly decreased the activity in nVH-lesioned animals. Increased basal levels as well as activity of prefrontal PKC and its anomalous regulation by alpha-1 adrenergic receptors may participate in the cognitive and stress-induced behavioral alterations in nVH-lesioned animals.

In addition, depression may induce gastrointestinal perturbations that maintain the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It has been shown that some specific probiotic formulations may reduce gastrointestinal problems induced by stress and the pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio Therefore, we hypothesised that probiotics, when given prophylactically, may diminish the apoptosis propensity in the limbic system following a MI. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were given probiotics (Lactobacillus helvencits and Bifidobacterium longum in combination) or placebo in their drinking-water for four consecutive weeks A MI was then induced in the rats by occluding the left anterior coronary artery for 40min. Rats were killed following a 72h reperfusion period Infarct size was not different in the two groups. Bax/Bcl-2 (pro-apoptotic/anti-apoptotic) ratio and caspase-3 (pro-apoptotic) activity were reduced in the amygdala (lateral and medial), as well as in the dentate gyrus in the probiotics group when compared with the placebo. Akt activity (anti-apoptotic) was increased in these same three regions. No significant difference was observed in Ca1 and Ca3 for the different markers measured In conclusion, the probiotics L helvetcus and B longum, given in combination a,, preventive therapy, reduced the predisposition of apoptosis found in different cerebral regions following a MI.

Here we present functional connectivity analyses of this region using resting-state functional MRI data collected from both humans and macaque monkeys. Three distinct patterns of functional connectivity were demonstrated within the precuneus of both species, with each subdivision suggesting a discrete functional role: (i) the anterior precuneus, functionally connected with the superior parietal cortex, paracentral lobule, and motor cortex, suggesting a sensorimotor region; (ii) the central precuneus, functionally connected to the dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal, and multimodal lateral inferior parietal cortex, suggesting a cognitive/associative region; and (iii) the posterior precuneus, displaying functional connectivity with adjacent visual cortical regions. These functional connectivity patterns were differentiated from the more ventral networks associated with the posterior cingulate, which connected with limbic structures such as the medial temporal cortex, dorsal and ventromedial prefrontal regions, posterior lateral inferior parietal regions, and the lateral temporal cortex. Our findings are consistent with predictions from anatomical tracer studies in the monkey, and provide support that resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) may in part reflect underlying anatomy. These subdivisions within the precuneus suggest that neuroimaging studies will benefit from treating this region as anatomically (and thus functionally) heterogeneous. Furthermore, the consistency between functional connectivity networks in monkeys and humans provides support for RSFC as a viable tool for addressing cross-species comparisons of functional neuroanatomy.

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 interacts with Parkin, DJ-1 and PINK-1 in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Parkinson's disease	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; GENE LRRK2; DEGENERATION; KINASE; PHOSPHORYLATION; NEUROTOXICITY; MORPHOLOGY; EXPOSURE; PATHWAY	Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most common genetic cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its physiological and pathological functions are unknown. Therefore, we generated several independent Drosophila lines carrying WT or mutant human LRRK2 (mutations in kinase, COR or LRR domains, resp.). Ectopic expression of WT or mutant LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons caused their significant loss accompanied by complex age-dependent changes in locomotor activity. Overall, the ubiquitous expression of LRRK2 increased lifespan and fertility of the flies. However, these flies were more sensitive to rotenone. LRRK2 expression in the eye exacerbated retinal degeneration. Importantly, in double transgenic flies, various indices of the eye and dopaminergic survival were modified in a complex fashion by a concomitant expression of PINK1, DJ-1 or Parkin. This evidence suggests a genetic interaction between these PD-relevant genes.	[Kabbach, Ghassan; Abdel-Messih, Elizabeth; Zhang, Yi; Slack, Ruth S.; Haque, M.

In the subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream, precursor cells contact each other. Cell-cell interactions mediated via adhesion molecules are no doubt involved in establishing and maintaining the neurogenic ability of these cells. Here, we demonstrate that N-cadherin plays important roles in forming cell clusters and in regulating cell differentiation. N-cadherin is abundantly expressed in chain migrating cells in the subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream but is down-regulated after cells exit these regions. We also show that neurosphere formation is inhibited via suppression of N-cadherin function and that N-cadherin expression is decreased after induction of neurosphere differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that functional blockade of N-cadherin can enhance glial cell differentiation in explant cultures of precursors from the subventricular zone. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

NF155 is present in the oligodendrocyte cell body and processes, whereas caspr is on the axonal surface. In mature nerves, these proteins are clustered at paranodes, flanking the node of Ranvier. To understand how NF155 and caspr become localized to the paranodal regions of myelinated nerves, we have studied their distribution over time in myelinating cultures. Our observations indicate that these two proteins are recruited to the cell surface at the contact zone between axons and oligodendrocytes, where they trans-interact. This association explains the early pattern of caspr distribution, a helical coil that winds around the axon, resembling the turns of the myelin sheath. Caspr, an axonal membrane protein, therefore seems to move in register with the overlying myelinating cell via its interactions with myelin proteins. We suggest that NF155 is the glial cell membrane protein responsible for caspr distribution. The pair act as interacting partners on either side of the axoglial contact area. Most likely, there are other proteins on the axonal surface whose distribution is equally influenced by interaction with the nascent myelin sheath. The fact that caspr follows the movement of the spiraling membrane has a direct affect on the interpretation of the way in which myelin is formed. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, the nature of the disease that emerges front RBD has not been fully characterized. Since 2004, we have been conducting a prospective study of idiopathic RBD patients, providing an opportunity to directly observe patients as they transitioned to a defined neurodegenerative syndrome. Patients with idiopathic RBD underwent an extensive annual evaluation of motor function, olfaction, color vision, autonomic function, cognition and psychiatric symptoms. Neurodegenerative disease was defined according to standard criteria. We compared these measures in patients who had developed PD to those with dementia, all within the first year of developing disease. Of 67 patients, 6 developed PD and eleven developed dementia. Except for cognitive functioning, all tests of olfaction, color vision, autonomic function, depression, and quantitative measures of motor speed were similar in patients with PD and dementia. Of dementia patients, seven met criteria for probable Lewy body dementia (LBD) and four for Alzheimer's disease (or, possible LBD). In all probable LBD cases, the diagnosis was made because of parkinsonism, with no patient experiencing hallucinations or fluctuations. Patients with "Alzheimer's disease" seemed to have LBD, as they demonstrated typical LBD cognitive profiles on neuropsychological testing and were indistinguishable from LBD patients in ancillary measures. Therefore, among RBD patients with new-onset LBD, hallucinations or fluctuations are absent, suggesting that RBD is a reliable early sign of LBD. The indistinguishability of dementia and PD in all ancillary Measures suggests a single unitary "RBD-then-neurodegeneration" process, the clinical presentation of which depends upon selective neuronal Vulnerability.

A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on a cohort of 19 myelomeningocele patients undergoing spino-pelvic deformity surgery. Objective. To examine if greater curve correction with third generation spinal implants correlate with improved pressure distribution and resolution, or prevention of skin ulcerations in myelomeningocele patients. Summary of Background Data. Children born with myelomeningocele have often complex spino-pelvic deformities leading to skin ulcerations. Methods. A cohort of 19 consecutive wheelchair dependent patients with myelodisplastic spinal deformities, who underwent spinal surgery, was prospectively followed with regular pressure mappings for a minimum of 2 years. Standard spino-pelvic radiologic measurements were obtained. Sitting pressure mappings were obtained over the study period using the Force Sensitive Applications from Vista Medical (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). Statistical analysis was done using SAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Paired t-test and Wilcox on Signed Rank test was used where applicable. Significance was taken to be P < 0.05. Results. Surgery significantly corrected radiographic parameters, specifically, Cobb angle (52%), pelvic obliquity (89%), and to a lesser degree pelvic tilt. Stratifying the data based on fixation type showed that the M-W construct was able to significantly correct pelvic obliquity. While significant changes in radiographic variables were observed after surgery, this was not the case with the various pressure mapping variables. Only minor changes after surgery were observed in the average pressure, maximum pressure, and variable coefficient of pressure. What was observed was an improvement in the overall distribution from anterior/posterior and right/left. While the values only approached statistical significance (P = 0.053) for right/left, however, this did not appear to be clinically significant regarding skin ulceration. Conclusion. Despite significant surgical corrections in radiographic parameters, these resulted in small changes in pressure distributions and do not appear to influence skin ulceration in the myelomeningocele patient. Pressure mapping may not be a useful tool in predicting outcome of spinal surgery. Factors which were proven to influence pressure distribution are the sagittal pelvic orientation and also achieving coronal spine balance.

Here we review findings from our work on the nature and regulation of rhythms of expression of PER2 in two anatomically and neurochemically defined subregions of the central extended amygdala, the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA). Daily rhythms in the expression of PER2 in these regions are coupled to those of the master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) but, importantly, they are sensitive to homeostatic perturbations and to hormonal states that directly influence motivated behavior.

Using our docking program FITTED, we have designed a series of constrained covalent inhibitors, built from a series of bicyclic scaffolds, to study the optimal shape required for these small molecules. These structures bear nitrile functional groups that we predicted to covalently bind to the catalytic serine of the enzyme. Synthesis and biological assays using human brain-derived astrocytic cells and endothelial cells and human fibroblasts revealed that these compounds act as selective inhibitors of prolyl oligopeptidase activity compared to prolyl-dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase activity, are able to penetrate the cells and inhibit intracellular activities in intact living cells. This integrated computational and experimental study shed light oil the binding mode of inhibitors in the enzyme active site and will guide the design of future drug-like molecules.

However, the extent to which the radial glia are themselves influenced by retinal inputs and visual experience remains unknown. Using multiphoton live imaging of radial glia in the optic tectum of intact Xenopus laevis tadpoles in conjunction with manipulations of neural activity and sensory stimuli, radial glia were observed to exhibit spontaneous calcium transients that were modulated by visual stimulation. Structurally, radial glia extended and retracted many filopodial processes within the tectal neuropil over minutes. These processes interacted with retinotectal synapses and their motility was modulated by nitric oxide (NO) signaling downstream of neuronal NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation and visual stimulation. These findings provide the first in vivo demonstration that radial glia actively respond both structurally and functionally to neural activity, via NMDAR-dependent NO release during the period of retinal axon ingrowth.

Columnar restriction is conceptually similar to tiling, a phenomenon referring to the avoidance of neurites from adjacent same-type neurons. The molecular mechanism underlying the establishment of columnar restriction or axonal/dendritic tiling remains largely undefined. Here, we identify Turtle (Tutl), a member of the conserved Tutl/Dasm1/IgSF9 subfamily of the Ig superfamily, as a key player in regulating the tiling pattern of R7 photoreceptor terminals in Drosophila. Tutl functions to prevent fusion between two adjacent R7 terminals, and acts in parallel to the Activin pathway. Tutl mediates homophilic cell-cell interactions. We propose that extrinsic terminal-terminal recognition mediated by Tutl, acts in concert with intrinsic Activin-dependent control of terminal growth, to restrict the connection made by each R7 axon to a single column.

In mice, the accessory olfactory system is thought to regulate a wide variety of social and sexual behaviors. The expression of the Slit receptors Robo-1 and Robo-2 in vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) suggests they may direct the stereotypic targeting of their axons to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Here, we have examined the roles of Robo-1 and Robo-2 in the formation of connections by VSN axons within the AOB. While Robo-1 is not necessary for the segregation of VSN axons within the anterior and posterior regions of the AOB, Robo-2 is required for the targeting of some basal VSN axons to the posterior region of the AOB but is dispensable for the fasciculation of VSN axons. Furthermore, the specific ablation of Robo-2 expression in VSNs leads to mistargeting of a portion of basal VSN axons to the anterior region of the AOB, indicating that Robo-2 expression is required on projecting VSN axons. Together, these results identify Robo-2 as a receptor that controls the targeting of basal VSN axons to the posterior AOB.	[Prince, Janet E.

Various interventions that modulate pain, such as the application of a competing noxious stimulus (counterirritation), are thought to involve cerebrospinal regulation through diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNICs). However, no study has yet examined the relation between brain and spinal cord activity during counterirritation analgesia in humans. This fMRI study investigates brain responses to phasic painful electrical stimulation administered to the sural nerve to evoke a spinal nociceptive response (RIII reflex) before, during and after counterirritation induced by the immersion of the left contralateral foot in cold water. Responses are compared with a control condition without counterirritation. As expected, counterirritation produced robust pain inhibition with residual analgesia persisting during the recovery period. In contrast, RIII reflex amplitude was significantly decreased by counterirritation only in a subset of subjects. Modulatory effects of counterirritation on pain perception and spinal nociception were paralleled by decreased shock-evoked activity in pain-related areas. Individual changes in shock-evoked brain activity were specifically related to analgesia in primary somatosensory cortex (SI), anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala, and to RIII modulation in supplementary motor area and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Moreover, sustained activation induced by the counterirritation stimulus in the OFC predicted shock-pain decrease while sustained activity in SI and the periaqueductal gray matter predicted RIII modulation. These results provide evidence for the implication of at least two partly separable neural mechanisms underlying the effects of counterirritation on pain and spinal nociception in humans.

Canadian Critical Care Trials Grp	Critically Ill Patients With 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) Infection in Canada	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							A H1N1 VIRUS; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PANDEMICS; DURATION	Context Between March and July 2009, the largest number of confirmed cases of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection occurred in North America. Objective To describe characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of critically ill patients in Canada with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection. Design, Setting, and Patients A prospective observational study of 168 critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection in 38 adult and pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada between April 16 and August 12, 2009. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome measures were 28-day and 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of ICU stay. Results Critical illness occurred in 215 patients with confirmed (n=162), probable (n=6), or suspected (n=47) community-acquired 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection. Among the 168 patients with confirmed or probable 2009 influenza A(H1N1), the mean(SD) age was 32.3 (21.4) years; 113 were female (67.3%) and 50 were children (29.8%). Overall mortality among critically ill patients at 28 days was 14.3% (95% confidence interval, 9.5%-20.7%). There were 43 patients who were aboriginal Canadians (25.6%). The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4 days (interquartile range [IQR], 2-7 days) and from hospitalization to ICU admission was 1 day (IQR, 0-2 days). Shock and nonpulmonary acute organ dysfunction was common (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment mean [SD] score of 6.8 [3.6] on day 1). Neuraminidase inhibitors were administered to 152 patients (90.5%). All patients were severely hypoxemic (mean [SD] ratio of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen [FIO2] of 147 [128] mm Hg) at ICU admission. Mechanical ventilation was received by 136 patients (81.0%). The median duration of ventilation was 12 days (IQR, 6-20 days) and ICU stay was 12 days (IQR, 5-20 days). Lung rescue therapies included neuromuscular blockade (28% of patients), inhaled nitric oxide (13.7%), high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (11.9%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4.2%), and prone positioning ventilation (3.0%). Overall mortality among critically ill patients at 90 days was 17.3%(95% confidence interval, 12.0%-24.0%; n=29). Conclusion Critical illness due to 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in Canada occurred rapidly after hospital admission, often in young adults, and was associated with severe hypoxemia, multisystem organ failure, a requirement for prolonged mechanical ventilation, and the frequent use of rescue therapies.

A Mutation that Creates a Pseudoexon in SOD1 Causes Familial ALS	ANNALS OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; neurodegenerative disease; SOD1; cryptic exon; intronic mutation; alternative splicing	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; CU/ZN SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; MESSENGER-RNA; CHROMOSOME 9P; GENE; LOCUS; LINKAGE; IDENTIFICATION; DISEASE	P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult onset neurodegenerative disease which targets motor neurons of the cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. About 5-10% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases are familial (FALS), and 15-20% of FALS cases are caused by mutations in the zinc-copper superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1). We identified a large family from France with ten members affected with ALS. Linkage was established to the SOD1 locus on chromosome 21 and genomic and cDNA sequencing was performed for the SOD1 gene. This revealed an activated pseudoexon between exons 4 and 5 that was present in two tested members of the family. Translation of this 43 base pair exon results in the introduction of seven amino acids before a stop codon is present, leading to a prematurely truncated SOD1 protein product of 125 amino acids. Sequencing intron 4 in a patient revealed a heterozygous change 304 bp before exon 5 (c.358 - 304C > G), but only 5 bp after the cryptic exon, thus causing this alternative splice product. This mutation segregated in all affected individuals of the family. This adds an additional genetic mechanism for developing SOD1-linked ALS and is one which can be more readily targeted by gene therapy.

Our objectives were to determine the source of central nervous system (CNS) NMO-IgGs and their role in disease pathogenesis. Methods: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and single-cell reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were used to identify overrepresented plasma cell immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of an NMO patient after a first clinical attack. Monoclonal recombinant antibodies (rAbs) were generated from the paired heavy and light chain sequences and tested for target specificity and Fc effector function. The effect of CSF rAbs on CNS immunopathology was investigated by delivering single rAbs to rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Results: Repertoire analysis revealed a dynamic, clonally expanded plasma cell population with features of an antigen-targeted response. Using multiple independent assays, 6 of 11 rAbs generated from CSF plasma cell clones specifically bound to AQP4. AQP4-specific rAbs recognized conformational epitopes and mediated both AQP4-directed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated lysis. When administered to rats with EAE, an AQP4-specific NMO CSF rAb induced NMO immunopathology: perivascular astrocyte depletion, myelinolysls, and complement and Ig deposition. Interpretation: Molecular characterization of the CSF plasma cell repertoire in an early NMO patient demonstrates that AQP4-specfic Ig is synthesized intrathecally at disease onset and directly contributes to CNS pathology. AQP4 is now the first confirmed antigenic target in human demyelinating disease.

In the present Study, we examined spinal cord tissue from 30 clinically well-characterized MS patients. MS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and control spinal cord tissue were subjected to morphometric analysis and immunohistochemistry, for markers of cell damage and regeneration. Data were related to disease duration and age at death. Here, we present evidence for substantial, non-progressive neuronal loss on the cervical and lumbar levels early in the disease course of MS. Chromatolytic neurons and immunoreactivity for c-Jun and GAP43 were observed in the ventral gray matter in and adjacent to actively demyelinating lesions, pointing toward neuronal damage and regeneration as an early response to lesion formation.

Objective: To evaluate the involvement of the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) in mediating the relationship between PEMCS and substance use. Design: Cross-sectional analyses from the Saguenay Youth Study aimed at evaluating the effects of PEMCS on brain development and behavior among adolescents. Nonexposed adolescents were matched with adolescents exposed prenatally to cigarette smoking by maternal educational level. Participants and Setting: A French Canadian founder population of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, Canada. The behavioral data set included 597 adolescents (275 sibships; 12-18 years of age), half of whom were exposed in utero to maternal cigarette smoking. Analysis of cortical thickness and genotyping were performed using available data from 314 adolescents. Main Outcome Measures: The likelihood of substance use was assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Predictive Scales. The number of different drugs tried by each adolescent was assessed using another questionnaire. Thickness of the OFC was estimated from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images using FreeSurfer software. Results: Prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking is associated with an increased likelihood of substance use. Among exposed adolescents, the likelihood of drug experimentation correlates with the degree of OFC thinning. In nonexposed adolescents, the thickness of the OFC increases as a function of the number of drugs tried. The latter effect is moderated by a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genotype (Val66Met). Conclusions: We speculate that PEMCS interferes with the development of the OFC and, in turn, increases the likelihood of drug use among adolescents. In contrast, we suggest that, among nonexposed adolescents, drug experimentation influences the OFC thickness via processes akin to experience-induced plasticity.

Post-TBI neuroendocrine disorders have been increasingly acknowledged in recent years due to their potential contribution to morbidity and, probably, to mortality after trauma. Marked alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis during the post-TBI acute and chronic phases have been reported. Prospective and longitudinal studies have shown that some abnormalities are transitory. On the other hand, there is a high frequency (15% to 68%) of pituitary hormone deficiency among TBI survivors in a long term setting. Post-TBI hypogonadism is a common finding after cranial trauma, and it is predicted to develop in 16% of the survivors in the long term. Post-TBI hypogonadism has been associated with adverse results in the acute and chronic phases after injury. These data reinforce the need for identification of hormonal deficiencies and their proper treatment, in order to optimize patient recovery, improve their life quality, and avoid the negative consequences of non-treated hypogonadism in the long term.

The granulin gene family: from cancer to dementia	BIOESSAYS			English	Article						carcinogenesis; evolution; frontotemporal lobar dementia; inflammation; wounds	FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; LEUKOCYTE PROTEASE INHIBITOR; EPITHELIN PRECURSOR GEP; PROMOTES TUMOR-GROWTH; FACTOR 1 RECEPTOR; PROGRANULIN GENE; CELL-GROWTH; OVARIAN-CANCER; IN-VIVO	The growth factor progranulin (PGRN) regulates cell division, survival, and migration. PGRN is an extracellular glycoprotein bearing multiple copies of the cysteine-rich granulin motif. With PGRN family members in plants and slime mold, it represents one of the most ancient of the extracellular regulatory proteins still extant in modern animals. PRGN has multiple biological roles. It contributes to the regulation of early embryogenesis, to adult tissue repair and inflammation. Elevated PGRN levels often occur in cancers, and PGRN immunotherapy inhibits the growth of hepatic cancer xenografts in mice. Recent studies have demonstrated roles for PGRN in neurobiology. An autosomal dominant mutation in GRN, the gene for PGRN, leads to neuronal atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes, resulting in the disease frontotemporal lobar dementia. In this review we will discuss current knowledge of the multifaceted biology of PGRN.	[Bateman, Andrew; Bennett, Hugh P.

We examined the brain expression and genetic/epigenetic regulation of QKI, an oligodendrocyte-specific RNA binding protein important for cell development and myelination. Methods: The microarray-based expression of QKI was evaluated in cortical and subcortical brain regions from suicide victims with a diagnosis of major depression (n = 16) and control subjects (n = 13). These findings were also assessed with a real-time (quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR]) approach, with QKI protein levels evaluated through immunoblotting. Identification of a QKI promoter sequence was then used to examine genetic and epigenetic variation at the QKI locus. Results: The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of multiple transcripts of QKI were evaluated on Affymetrix microarrays, revealing significant reductions in 11 cortical regions and the hippocampus and amygdala of suicide victims compared with control subjects. Microarray findings were confirmed by qPCR, and reduced expression of QKI protein was identified in orbitofrontal cortex. Analysis of promoter variation and methylation state in a subset of individuals did not identify differences at the genetic or epigenetic level between depressed suicide victims and control subjects. Conclusions: The observation of consistent reductions in multiple isoforms of QKI mRNA in depressed suicide victims supports the growing body of evidence for a role of myelination-related deficits in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. A specific role of QKI in this process is implied by its reduced expression and known interactions with genes involved in oligodendrocyte determination; however, QKI gene variation responsible for these changes remains to be identified.

Thinning of the Motor-Cingulate-Insular Cortices in Siblings Concordant for Tourette Syndrome	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Tourette syndrome; Cortical thickness; Neuroimaging; Anterior cingulate; Insula; Motor; Similarity; Intra class correlations	CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN STRUCTURE; TIC SEVERITY; MRI DATA; SCALE; RELIABILITY; MORPHOMETRY; EVOLUTION; VALIDITY; FAMILY	Fraternal twin studies on normal subjects have demonstrated low heritability (intra-class correlation coefficient) estimates for frontal brain regions (r = 0.43). Here we aimed to investigate the relatedness/similarity estimates of the frontal brain regions in fraternal subjects concordant for Tourette syndrome (TS). We sought to identify regional brain similarities between siblings concordant for TS as an exploratory step towards the identification of potential brain structures involved in the TS phenotype. The identified brain structures may then serve in subsequent molecular genetic and linkage studies. In addition, we regressed cortical thickness and TS clinical severity scores to assess the relation between TS clinical symptoms and cortical structures. Sixteen sibling pairs concordant for TS were scanned using a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner (age range 10-25, mean 17.19 +/- A 4.1). Brain morphology was assessed using the fully automated Civet pipeline at the Montreal Neurological Institute. TS was assessed using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the Goetz Tic Scale. We report high relatedness/similarity estimates for fraternal siblings concordant for TS (r = 0.86-0.60) in the middle frontal-motor/cingulate/insular cortices. Regression analysis revealed significant negative correlations in the right insula with the YGTSS (r = -0.41, F = 6.09, P < 0.02) and the left cingulated cortex with the (CY-BOCS) (r = -0.35, F = 4.30, P < 0.05). Since previous findings have concluded that normal fraternal siblings are less alike in frontal cortices, the present findings may be attributed to TS. We speculate that the high ICC between siblings and the negative correlation between TS symptoms severity and cortical thickness measurements are related to the disturbances in the maturation of the motor-cingulate-insular cortical neural system that mediate self-regulatory processes. Such delayed maturation may consequently contribute to the development of TS by releasing motor and vocal tics from regulatory control. These findings may have important genetic implications.

The Metabolic Epicenter of Supratentorial Gliomas: A H-1-MRSI Study	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; HYPERFRACTIONATED RADIATION-THERAPY; PROTON MR SPECTROSCOPY; LOW-GRADE ASTROCYTOMA; GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME; MALIGNANT GLIOMA; BRAIN-TUMORS; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; ONCOLOGY-GROUP; PHASE-II	Background: Assessing the impact of glioma location on prognosis remains elusive. We approached the problem using multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRST) to define a tumor "metabolic epicenter", and examined the relationship of metabolic epicenter location to survival and histopathological grade. Methods: We studied 54 consecutive patients with a supratentorial glioma (astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma, WHO grades II-IV). The metabolic epicenter in each tumor was defined as the H-1-MRSI voxel containing maximum intra-tumoral choline on preoperative imaging. Tumor location was considered the X-Y-Z coordinate position, in a standardized stereotactic space, of the metabolic epicenter. Correlation between epicenter location and survival or grade was assessed. Results: Metabolic epicenter location correlated significantly with patient survival for all tumors (r(2) = 0.30, p = 0.0002) and astrocytomas alone (r(2) = 0.32, p = 0.005). A predictive model based on both metabolic epicenter location and histopathological grade accounted for 70% of the variability in survival, substantially improving on histology alone to predict survival. Location also correlated significantly with grade (r(2) = 0.25, p = 0.001): higher grade tumors had a metabolic epicenter closer to the midpoint of the brain. Conclusions: The concept of the metabolic epicenter eliminates several problems related to existing methods of classifying glioma location. The location of the metabolic epicenter is strongly correlated with overall survival and histopathological grade, suggesting that it reflects biological factors underlying glioma growth and malignant dedifferentiation. These findings may be clinically relevant to predicting patterns of local glioma recurrence, and in planning resective surgery or radiotherapy.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Background. Prior studies have shown that the electroencephalogram (EEG) is of low diagnostic yield in the evaluation of syncope but have not looked at the yield according to referring physician specialty. The goals of this study were to determine if the yield of the EEG is higher when ordered by neurologists and whether EEGs with abnormal findings resulted in any significant change in patient management. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of the EEGs requested for a clinical diagnosis of syncope, convulsive syncope, loss of consciousness, or falls from 2003 to 2007 at our institution. We obtained further information from the medical record of patients with an abnormal EEG. Results: Of 517 EEGs meeting our inclusion criteria, only 57 (11.0%) were read as abnormal. No EEG was positive for epileptiform activity and only 9 (1.6%) showed potentially epileptic activity. EEGs ordered by neurologists did not have a higher yield compared to non-neurologists. Five abnormal EEGs resulted in further investigations being ordered. One patient was ultimately started on phenytoin. Conclusions: EEGs requested for the evaluation of patients with suspected syncope have an extremely low diagnostic yield and do not significantly alter the management of the patients, regardless of the specialty of the referring physician.

Magnetic resonance molecular imaging of post-stroke neuroinflammation with a P-selectin targeted iron oxide nanoparticle	CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						magnetic resonance imaging; P-selectin; stroke; neuroinflammation; iron oxide; nanoparticle	EARLY ENDOTHELIAL ACTIVATION; CEREBRAL-ARTERY OCCLUSION; CONTRAST AGENT; RAT-BRAIN; STROKE; ISCHEMIA; INFLAMMATION; INJURY; REPERFUSION; EXPRESSION	We have developed a magnetic resonance molecular imaging method using a novel iron-oxide contrast agent targeted towards P-selectin - MNP-PBP (magnetic nanoparticle-P-selectin binding peptide) - to image endothelial activation following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. MNP-PBP consists of similar to 1000 PBP ligands (primary sequence: GSIQPRPQIHNDGDFEEIPEEYLQ GGSSLVSVLDLEPLDAAWL) conjugated to a 50 nm diameter aminated dextran iron oxide particle. In vitro P- and E-selectin binding was assessed by competition ELISA. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male C57/BL 6 mice followed by contrast injection (MNP-PBP; MNP-NH2; Feridex; MNP-PBP-FITC) at 24 h after reperfusion and T(2) magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4 T was performed. Infarction and microvasculature accumulation of contrast agent was assessed in coronal brain sections. MNP-PBP attenuated antibody binding to P-selectin by 34.8 +/- 1.7%. P-selectin was preferentially increased in the infarct hemisphere and MNP-PBP-FITC accumulation in the infarct hemisphere microvasculature was observed. Compared with the nontargeted iron oxide agents MNP-NH2 and Feridex, MNP-PBP showed a significantly greater T(2) effect within the infarction. MR imaging of P-selectin expression with a targeted iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agent may reveal early endothelial activation in stroke and other neuroinflammatory states.

Recently, we have proposed that the study of these receptors may also bring a new hope for treating depression, their agonists possibly acting as fast-acting antidepressants. This hypothesis was based on several studies showing that 5-HT(4) receptors play an important role in the modulation of central 5-HT neurotransmission, both at pre- and postsynaptic levels. The possible physiological meaning of this control is discussed, together with the different research perspectives opened by its discovery.

Recent findings Recent publications have shown significant advancement in medical and invasive treatment of coronary artery disease in elderly, with special focus on the potential benefit of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery. Summary Although OPCAB surgery has gained popularity over the past 15 years, its benefit regarding operative mortality and major complications has not been clearly defined in the general population There is a body of literature supporting its benefit in the elderly population. OPCAB surgery has the potential of decreasing operative mortality and major postoperative complications such as stroke, delirium, atrial fibrillation, and decline in neurocognitive functions in these patients. Off-pump surgery is technically more demanding and has been blamed for providing less complete revascularization and lower graft patency rate, especially in less experienced hands However, with the upcoming demographic explosion of senior citizens in western societies, OPCAB surgery has definitely to be a part of the armamentarium of modern cardiac surgeons.

A standardized functional classification of gross motor skills has recently been validated - the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). The relationship between the neurological subtype of CP and GMFCS level remains undefined in CP. Method The Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry (Registre de la paralysie cerebrale au Quebec [REPACQ]) over a 4-year birth interval (1999-2002 inclusive) identified 301 children with CP. Information on both CP subtype and GMFCS level was available for 243 children (138 males, 105 females) with final data extraction at a mean age of 44 months (SD 14mo, range 24-79mo). Proportions of children with a particular CP subtype at GMFCS levels I to III versus levels IV to V were determined and compared. Results CP subtype versus GMFCS levels I to III or IV to V was distributed proportionally as follows: spastic diplegic, 51/52 (98%) versus 1/52 (2%); spastic quadriparetic, 20/85 (24%) versus 65/85 (76%); spastic hemiplegic, 76/77 (99%) versus 1/77 (1%); dyskinetic, 4/16 (25%) versus 12/16 (75%); other (triplegic or ataxic-hypotonic), 10/13 (77%) versus 3/13 (23%). These distributions (proportions) all yielded significant (p < 0.001) Pearson KH2 values. Interpretation Neurological subtype is a powerful predictor of functional status related to ambulation. This has implications for counseling families.

Circadian rhythms in clock gene expression are observed in the master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus but are also observed in many other brain regions that have diverse roles, including influences on motivational and emotional state, learning, hormone release and feeding. Increasingly, important links between circadian rhythms and metabolism are being uncovered. In particular, restricted feeding (RF) schedules which limit food availability to a single meal each day lead to the induction and entrainment of circadian rhythms in food-anticipatory activities in rodents. Food-anticipatory activities include increases in core body temperature, activity and hormone release in the hours leading up to the predictable mealtime. Crucially, RF schedules and the accompanying food-anticipatory activities are also associated with shifts in the daily oscillation of clock gene expression in diverse brain areas involved in feeding, energy balance, learning and memory, and motivation. Moreover, lesions of specific brain nuclei can affect the way rats will respond to RF, but have generally failed to eliminate all food-anticipatory activities. As a consequence, it is likely that a distributed neural system underlies the generation and regulation of food-anticipatory activities under RF. Thus, in the future, we would suggest that a more comprehensive approach should be taken, one that investigates the interactions between multiple circadian oscillators in the brain and body, and starts to report on potential neural systems rather than individual and discrete brain areas.

Among these genes, that encoding paraoxonase 1 (PON1) has gained newfound interest from a public health perspective, as recent studies have suggested that PON1 L55M and Q192R genetic variants might affect individual susceptibility to environmental events, such as exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors. Cholinesterase inhibitor therapy being the treatment of choice for patients with mild to moderate AD, we sought to answer two main questions: (i) are these genetic variants associated with increased AD risk, earlier age of onset/death, or shorter AD duration; and (ii) do they affect the neuropathological hallmarks of AD? This genetic study used a large cohort of clinical and autopsy-confirmed AD cases and age-matched, cognitively intact controls from the Douglas Hospital Brain Bank, Quebec, Canada (n = 1066). The evidence presented here suggests multiple gender-specific effects of PON1 polymorphisms on AD etiopathology. The L55M Met allele exerts an AD risk-enhancing effect only in men (P < 0.001), whereas both men and women carrying the M55M/Q192Q genotype exhibit increased survival (2.5 years, P < 0.05) and later age of onset (1.5 years, P < 0.05). These genetic variants are also individually and significantly associated, sometimes in opposite directions for both genders, with beta-amyloid levels (P < 0.001), senile plaque accumulation (P < 0.001) and choline acetyltransferase activity (P < 0.05) in, respectively, two of two, five of six, and three of six brain areas. These results suggest an involvement of the PON1 gene in AD etiopathology and responses to treatment.

Such changes enhance information processing capacity, which can be indexed by estimation of neural signal complexity. Here, we show that during development, EEG signal complexity increases from one month to 5 years of age in response to auditory and visual stimulation. However, the rates of change in complexity were not equivalent for the two responses. Infants' signal complexity for the visual condition was greater than auditory signal complexity, whereas adults showed the same level of complexity to both types of stimuli. The differential rates of complexity change may reflect a combination of innate and experiential factors on the structure and function of the two sensory systems.

These atlases can be customized to fit an individual patient's anatomy through atlas-to-patient warping procedures. Once fitted to pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, the customized atlas can be used to plan and navigate surgical procedures. Linear, piece-wise linear and nonlinear registration methods have been used to customize different digital atlases with varying accuracies. Our goal was to evaluate eight different registration methods for atlas-to-patient customization of a new digital atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus to demonstrate the value of nonlinear registration for automated atlas-based subcortical target identification in functional neurosurgery. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of two automated linear techniques, two piece-wise linear techniques (requiring the identification of manually placed anatomical landmarks), and four different automated nonlinear atlas-to-patient warping techniques (where two of the four nonlinear techniques are variants of the ANIMAL algorithm). Since a gold standard of the subcortical anatomy is not available, manual segmentations of the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus are used to derive a silver standard for evaluation. Four different metrics, including the kappa statistic, the mean distance between the surfaces, the maximum distance between surfaces, and the total structure volume are used to compare the warping techniques. The results show that nonlinear techniques perform statistically better than linear and piece-wise linear techniques. In addition, the results demonstrate statistically significant differences between the nonlinear techniques, with the ANIMAL algorithm yielding better results. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3574-3595, 2009.

According to the Kinematic Theory of rapid human movements, these parameters contain information on both the motor commands and the timing properties of a neuromuscular system. The new algorithm, called XZERO, exploits relationships between the zero crossings of the first and second time derivatives of a lognormal function and its four basic parameters. The methodology is described and then evaluated under various testing conditions. The new tool allows a greater variety of stroke patterns to be processed automatically. Furthermore, for the first time, the extraction accuracy is quantified empirically, taking advantage of the exponential relationships that link the dispersion of the extraction errors with its signal-to-noise ratio. A new extraction system which combines this algorithm with two other previously published methods is also described and evaluated. This system provides researchers involved in various domains of pattern analysis and artificial intelligence with new tools for the basic study of single strokes as primitives for understanding rapid human movements.

The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) plays a significant neuroprotective role in medulloblastoma survival through regulation of the downstream effectors of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase-protein kinase-B (PI3K-PKB/c-Akt) pathway. One such target is Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1; FKHR), which is part of the FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors. Phosphorylation by Akt results in cytoplasmic sequestration of FOXO1 thus inhibiting the expression of genes controlling cell death, cell proliferation, differentiation, cellular metabolism and oxidative stress. Here we show that serum starvation of medulloblastoma cells is accompanied by nuclear translocation of FOXO1. IGF-I stimulation of serum-starved cells resulted in rapid phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO1, and was associated with a significant increase in cell viability. In contrast, expression of a constitutively active form of FOXO1 that cannot be phosphorylated led to a significant reduction in medulloblastoma cell viability, even in the presence of growth factors provided by fetal bovine serum (FBS). These data suggest that the transcription factor FOXO1 may be a critical effector of medulloblastoma growth suppression.

The cause of death was established as a craniocerebral trauma with brain expulsion. The circumstances and manner of death were still unclear at that time. A low fall seemed very unlikely considering the severity of the skull and brain damage. The police investigation clearly revealed that the man, in a paranoid psychotic state, attacked his wife with a knife and then was witnessed by his children to have hit his head several times with a hammer. Afterwards, they saw him running to the top of the basement stairs and jumping to the bottom of the stairs head first.

Asymmetric changes in cutaneous reflexes after a partial spinal lesion and retention following spinalization during locomotion in the cat. J Neurophysiol 102: 2667-2680, 2009. First published September 2, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.00572.2009. Locomotion involves dynamic interactions between the spinal cord, supraspinal signals, and peripheral sensory inputs. After incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), interactions are disrupted, and remnant structures must optimize function to maximize locomotion. We investigated if cutaneous reflexes are altered following a unilateral partial spinal lesion and whether changes are retained within spinal circuits after complete spinal transection (i.e., spinalization). Four cats were chronically implanted with recording and stimulating electrodes. Cutaneous reflexes were evoked with cuff electrodes placed around left and right superficial peroneal nerves. Control data, consisting of hindlimb kinematics and electromyography ( bursts of muscular activity and cutaneous reflexes), were recorded during treadmill locomotion. After stable control data were achieved (53-67 days), a partial spinal lesion was made at the 10th or 11th thoracic segment (T-10-T-11) on the left side. Cats were trained to walk after the partial lesion, and following a recovery period (64-80 days), a spinalization was made at T-13. After the partial lesion, changes in short-latency excitatory (P1) homologous responses between hindlimbs, evoked during swing, were largely asymmetric in direction relative to control values, whereas changes in longer-latency excitatory (P2) and crossed responses were largely symmetric in direction. After spinalization, cats could display hindlimb locomotion within 1 day. Early after spinalization, reflex changes persisted a few days, but over time homologous P1 responses increased symmetrically toward or above control levels. Therefore changes in cutaneous reflexes after the partial lesion and retention following spinalization indicate an important spinal plasticity after incomplete SCI.

Effects of canal plugging on the vestibuloocular reflex and vestibular nerve discharge during passive and active head rotations. J Neurophysiol 102: 2693-2703, 2009. First published September 2, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.00710.2009. Mechanical occlusion (plugging) of the slender ducts of semicircular canals has been used in the clinic as well as in basic vestibular research. Here, we investigated the effect of canal plugging in two macaque monkeys on the horizontal vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the responses of vestibular-nerve afferents during passive head rotations. Afferent responses to active head movements were also studied. The horizontal VOR gain decreased after plugging to <0.1 for frequencies <2 Hz but rose to about 0.6 as frequency was increased to 15 Hz. Afferents innervating plugged horizontal canals had response sensitivities that increased with the frequency of passive rotations from <0.01 (spikes/s)/(degrees/s) at 0.5 Hz to values of about 0.2 and 0.5 (spikes/s)/(degrees/s) at 8 Hz for regular and irregular afferents, respectively (<50% of responses in controls). An increase in phase lead was also noted following plugging in afferent discharge, but not in the VOR. Because the phase discrepancy between the VOR and afferent discharge is much larger than that seen in control animals, this suggests that central adaptation shapes VOR dynamics following plugging. The effect of canal plugging on afferent responses can be modeled as an increase in stiffness and a reduction in the dominant time constant and gain in the transfer function describing canal dynamics. Responses were also evident during active head rotations, consistent with the frequency content of these movements. We conclude that canal plugging in macaques is effective only at frequencies <2 Hz. At higher frequencies, afferents show significant responses, with a nearly 90 phase lead, such that they encode near-rotational acceleration. Our results demonstrate that afferents innervating plugged canals respond robustly during voluntary movements, a finding that has implications for understanding the effects of canal plugging in clinical practice.

Across a range of chronic pain conditions, similar observations have been made regarding changes in structure and function within the brains of patients. We discuss these observations within the framework of the current definition of a disease. Perspective: Neuroimaging studies have made a significant scientific impact in the study of pain. Knowledge of nociceptive processing in the noninjured and injured central nervous system has grown considerably over the past 2 decades. This review examines the information from these functional, structural, and molecular studies within the framework of a disease state.

Role of NF kappa B in an Animal Model of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome-type I (CRPS-I)	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						Chronic postischemia pain; CPIP; pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; PDTC; ischemia; reperfusion; inflammation; neuropathic pain	CHRONIC POSTISCHEMIA PAIN; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; RAT MODEL; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; INTRATHECAL INJECTION; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; THERMAL HYPERALGESIA; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; GENE-EXPRESSION; SMOOTH-MUSCLE	NF kappa B is involved in several pathogenic mechanisms that are believed to underlie the complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), including ischemia, inflammation and sensitization. Chronic postischemia pain (CPIP) has been developed as an animal model that mimics the symptoms of CRPS-I. The possible involvement of NF kappa B in CRPS-I was studied using CPIP rats. Under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed around the rat left ankle joint, producing 3 hours of ischemia, followed by rapid reperfusion (IR injury). NF kappa B was measured in nuclear extracts of muscle and spinal cord tissue using ELISA. Moreover, the anti-allodynic (mechanical and cold) effect was tested for systemic, intrathecal, or intraplantar treatment with the NF kappa B inhibitor pyrrolidine clithiocarbamate (PDTC). At 2 and 48 hours after IR injury, NF kappa B was elevated in muscle and spinal cord of CPIP rats compared to shams. At 7 days, NF kappa B levels were normalized in muscle, but still elevated in spinal cord tissue. Systemic PDTC treatment relieved mechanical and cold allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, lasting for at least 3 hours. Intrathecal-but not intraplantar-administration also relieved mechanical allodynia. The results suggest that muscle and spinal NF kappa B plays a role in the pathogenesis of CPIP and potentially of human CRPS. Perspective: Using the CPIP model, we demonstrate that NF kappa B is involved in the development of allodynia after a physical injury (ischemia and reperfusion) without direct nerve trauma. Since CPIP animals exhibit many features of human CRPS-I, this observation indicates a potential role for NF kappa B in human CRPS.

A 39-year-old woman Suffering from an acute ST elevated myocardial infarction and severe cardiogenic shock underwent implant of left and right ventricular assist devices (BiVAD). Neurologic deficits prevented her from safely resuming oral intake, and long-term feeding access was required. The decision was made to insert a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy under fluoroscopic guidance. Patients implanted with ventricular assist devices may require enteral nutrition support. Placement of feeding access other than through the nasoenteric route can be rendered more challenging because Of anatomical constraints related to BiVAD positioning; however whenever enteral nutrition Support is required for extended periods percutaneous or ostomy access offers easier delivery of nutrition. Although technically difficult, Successful placement of the enteral feeding tube allowed for continuous 24-hour feeds to optimize nutrition intake. This is the first time that a percutaneous enteral feeding access was obtained for a ventricular assist device patient at the authors' institution, and it has proven valuable in providing long-term nutrition in a safe and efficient manner.

Immunoneutralization of Agmatine Sensitizes Mice to mu-Opioid Receptor Tolerance	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							SPINAL NERVE-TERMINALS; RAT-BRAIN; DECARBOXYLATED ARGININE; MORPHINE-TOLERANCE; CORD-INJURY; ENDOMORPHIN-1; RELEASE; MOUSE; NEUROTRANSMITTER; ANTINOCICEPTION	Systemically or centrally administered agmatine (decarboxylated arginine) prevents, moderates, or reverses opioid-induced tolerance and self-administration, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and sequelae associated with ischemia and spinal cord injury in rodents. These behavioral models invoke the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor/nitric-oxide synthase cascade. Agmatine (AG) antagonizes the NMDA receptor and inhibits nitric-oxide synthase in vitro and in vivo, which may explain its effect in models of neural plasticity. Agmatine has been detected biochemically and immunohistochemically in the central nervous system. Consequently, it is conceivable that agmatine operates in an anti-glutamatergic manner in vivo; the role of endogenous agmatine in the central nervous system remains minimally defined. The current study used an immunoneutralization strategy to evaluate the effect of sequestration of endogenous agmatine in acute opioid analgesic tolerance in mice. First, intrathecal pretreatment with an anti-AG IgG (but not normal IgG) reversed an established pharmacological effect of intrathecal agmatine: antagonism of NMDA-evoked behavior. This result justified the use of anti-AG IgG to sequester endogenous agmatine in vivo. Second, intrathecal pretreatment with the anti-AG IgG sensitized mice to induction of acute spinal tolerance of two mu-opioid receptor-selective agonists, [D-Ala(2), N-Me- Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin and endomorphin-2. A lower dose of either agonist that, under normal conditions, produces moderate or no tolerance was tolerance-inducing after intrathecal pretreatment of anti-AG IgG (but not normal IgG). The effect of the anti-AG IgG lasted for at least 24 h in both NMDA-evoked behavior and the acute opioid tolerance. These results suggest that endogenous spinal agmatine may moderate glutamate-dependent neuroplasticity.	[Eskridge, Lori L.; Nguyen, H.

Duchenne, Charcot and Babinski, three neurologists of La Salpetriere Hospital, and their contribution to concepts of the central organization of motor synergy	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-PARIS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	COST Workshop on Advanced Methods for the Estimation of Human Brain Activity and Connectivity	APR 28-29, 2008	Jena, GERMANY	COST		Historical perspectives; Human neurophysiology; La Salpetriere Hospital; Locomotion; Motor co-ordination; Muscle sense; Synergy	INTERNAL-MODELS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; CEREBELLUM; HISTORY; COORDINATION; POSTURE; SYSTEM; EQUILIBRIUM; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION	Many currently accepted notions of motor control originate from a few seminal concepts developed in the latter half of the 19th century (see Bennett and Hacker, 2002). The goal of this review is to retrace some current ideas about motor control back to the thought of three French neurologists of Hospital of the Salpetriere hospital in Paris during the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century (Fig. 1): Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne (1806-1875), jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893), and Joseph Babinski (1857-1932). A common theoretical and methodological thread unites these three men as Charcot was taught neurology by Duchenne, and Babinski was trained by Charcot. The influential concepts developed by these pioneering French neurologists have been neglected for nearly a century and only rediscovered recently. We intend to highlight how these astute clinicians used their meticulous clinical observations of patients to reveal novel and original perspectives of motor co-ordination. Between 1850 and 1930, all three men played a major role in developing and shaping the entire field of normal and pathological motor control in addition to making important contributions to three major scientific issues; the centralist view of muscle sense, the emerging concept of muscle synergy in voluntary movements and in locomotion and finally the specific role of the cerebellum in muscle synergy. The important contributions of these men will be considered in the context of other significant schools of neurology from other countries. Finally, the concept of cerebellar asynergy as proposed by Babinski anticipated the development of the internal models which much later were able to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the mechanism of learned motor co-ordination involving the cerebellum.

Objective: To identify risk factors for NCM in patients with LCMN and Suggest guidelines for their management. Methods: Medical records of patients with LCMN were reviewed at Sainte-Justine Hospital between 1980 and 2006. Presence of multiple satellite nevi and posterior midline location were evaluated as risk factors for NCM using chi-square test. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed by a neuroradiologist. Results: Twenty-six of 52 patients underwent radiologic investigation. Six of 26 (23%) had NCM. Patients with this condition are more likely to have multiple satellite nevi (100% vs 50%, P = .03) and have a trend to posterior midline location of their LCMN (100% vs 60%, P = .08). Patients with NCM are more likely to have both multiple satellite nevi and posterior midline location (100% vs 25%, P = .002). Radiologic findings are also presented. Limitations: This was a retrospective case series with imprecise chart data in 38% of cases. Conclusion: The presence Of Multiple satellite nevi alone or with associated posterior midline location of LCMN is associated with a higher risk of NCM. We recommend magnetic resonance imaging testing before 4 months of age in patients with these features. (J Am Acad Dermatol 2009;61:766-74.)

J	Kriazhev, L				Kriazhev, L.			Calcium channel as a potential anticancer agent	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							CELL-DEATH; NEUROTOXICITY; VERSATILITY	Anticancer treatment in modern clinical practices includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy with or without surgical interventions. Efficiency of both methods varies greatly depending on cancer types and stages. Besides, chemo- and radiotherapy are toxic and damaging that causes serious side effects. This fact prompts the search for alternative methods of antitumor therapy. It is well known that prolonged or high increase of intracellular calcium concentration inevitably leads to the cell death via apoptosis or necrosis. However, stimulation of cell calcium level by chemical agents is hardly achievable because cells have very sophisticated machinery for maintaining intracellular calcium in physiological ranges. This obstacle can be overridden, nevertheless. It was found that calcium channels in so called calcium cells in land snails are directly regulated by extracellular calcium concentration. The higher the concentration the higher the calcium intake is through the channels. Bearing in mind that extracellular/intracellular calcium concentration ratio in human beings is 10,000-12,000 fold the insertion of the channel into cancer cells would lead to fast and uncontrollable by the cells calcium intake and cell death. Proteins composing the channel may be extracted from plasma membrane of calcium cells and sequenced by mass-spectrometry or N-terminal sequencing. Either proteins or corresponding genes could be used for targeted delivery into cancer cells. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The "epigenome" refers to the overall epigenetic state of a cell, and serves as an interface between the environment and the genome. The epigenome is dynamic and responsive to environmental signals not only during development, but also throughout life; and it is becoming increasingly apparent that chemicals can cause changes in gene expression that persist long after exposure has ceased. Here we present the hypothesis that commonly-used pharmaceutical drugs can cause such persistent epigenetic changes. Drugs may alter epigenetic homeostasis by direct or indirect mechanisms. Direct effects may be caused by drugs which affect chromatin architecture or DNA methylation. For example the anti hypertensive hydralazine inhibits DNA methylation. An example of an indirectly acting drug is isotretinoin, which has transcription factor activity. A two-tier mechanism is postulated for indirect effects in which acute exposure to a drug influences signaling pathways that may lead to an alteration of transcription factor activity at gene promoters. This stimulation results in the altered expression of receptors, signaling molecules, and other proteins necessary to alter genetic regulatory circuits. With more chronic exposure, cells adapt by an unknown hypothetical process that results in more permanent modifications to DNA methylation and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a given epigenetic network. Therefore, any epigenetic side-effect caused by a drug may persist after the drug is discontinued. It is further proposed that some iatrogenic diseases such as tardive dyskinesia and drug-induced SLE are epigenetic in nature. If this hypothesis is correct the consequences for modern medicine are profound, since it would imply that our current understanding of pharmacology is an oversimplification. We propose that epigenetic side-effects of pharmaceuticals may be involved in the etiology of heart disease, cancer, neurological and cognitive disorders, obesity, diabetes, infertility, and sexual dysfunction. It is suggested that a systems biology approach employing microarray analyses of gene expression and methylation patterns can lead to a better understanding of long-term side-effects of drugs, and that in the future, epigenetic assays should be incorporated into the safety assessment of all pharmaceutical drugs. This new approach to pharmacology has been termed "phamacoepigenomics", the impact of which may be equal to or greater than that of pharmacogenetics. We provide here an overview of this potentially major new field in pharmacology and medicine. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We describe findings indicating that GMX1778 is a potent and specific inhibitor of the NAD(+) biosynthesis enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Cancer cells have a very high rate of NAD(+) turnover, which makes NAD(+) modulation an attractive target for anticancer therapy. Selective inhibition by GMX1778 of NAMPT blocks the production of NAD(+) and results in tumor cell death. Furthermore, GMX1778 is phosphoribosylated by NAMPT, which increases its cellular retention. The cytotoxicity of GMX1778 can be bypassed with exogenous nicotinic acid (NA), which permits NAD(+) repletion via NA phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (NAPRT1). The cytotoxicity of GMX1778 in cells with NAPRT1 deficiency, however, cannot be rescued by NA. Analyses of NAPRT1 mRNA and protein levels in cell lines and primary tumor tissue indicate that high frequencies of glioblastomas, neuroblastomas, and sarcomas are deficient in NAPRT1 and not susceptible to rescue with NA. As a result, the therapeutic index of GMX1777 can be widended in the treatment animals bearing NAPRT1-deficient tumors by coadministration with NA. This provides the rationale for a novel therapeutic approach for the use of GMX1777 in the treatment of human cancers.

Growing, differentiating, transfecting, and recording from single neurons and neuronal networks all present particular challenges. Some of the difficulties arise from the small scale of cellular structures, and have already seen Substantial advances due to nanotechnology, particularly highly fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles. Other issues have less obvious solutions, but the complex and often surprising way that novel nanomaterials react with cells have Suggested some revolutionary approaches. We review some of the ways nanomaterials and nanostructures can contribute to in vitro neuroscience, with a particular focus on emphasizing techniques that are widely accessible to many laboratories and on providing references to protocols and methods. The issues of nanotoxicology of greatest interest to cultured neurons are discussed. Finally, we present some future trends and challenges in nano-neuroscience.

NATURE REVIEWS ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review							CONJUGATED EQUINE ESTROGENS; POSTMENOPAUSAL HORMONE-THERAPY; SURGICALLY MENOPAUSAL WOMEN; GLOBAL COGNITIVE FUNCTION; DENDRITIC SPINE DENSITY; REPLACEMENT THERAPY; TRANSDERMAL ESTRADIOL; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PLUS PROGESTIN; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES	According to the 'critical period' hypothesis, which attempts to explain the observed discrepancies in the studies on estrogen and cognition, estrogen therapy effectively decreases cognitive decline in aging women when it is initiated around the time of menopause but not when it is started decades later. Here, I review studies in which the timing of the initiation of estrogen therapy was provided, to determine whether their findings support the 'critical period' hypothesis. The vast majority of the reviewed studies support the idea that early but not late initiation of estrogen therapy might prevent or delay cognitive decline in aging women. Nevertheless, numerous design issues, such as the specific drugs and doses that were used, the possible effects of progestins on cognition, and the failure to administer neuropsychological tests of specific cognitive domains that are sensitive to estrogen therapy confound the extant literature. In view of the reanalyzes of the Women's Health Initiative's data that show a beneficial effect of estrogen therapy on cardiac and breast diseases in women aged 50-59 years, more definitive evidence is needed to confirm that the early initiation of estrogen therapy that is continued for a few years provides enduring protection against cognitive aging 15-20 years later.

The goal of this study was to characterise the response of pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to 5-HT and NMDA before and after administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (dizocilpine), a well-validated pharmacological model of psychosis. mPFC pyramidal (glutamatergic) neurons were recorded in urethane-anaesthetised rats. The responses to NMDA and 5-HT were assessed using in vivo electrophysiology and microiontophoresis. The 5-HT(2A/2C) antagonist ritanserin and the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY100635 were used to block 5-HT responses. MK-801 decreased the NMDA-induced excitatory responses and increased NMDA-evoked burst activity among mPFC pyramidal neurons. Three subpopulations of pyramidal cells were identified according to their responses to 5-HT: excitation (33%), inhibition (40%) and non-response (27%). The inhibitory responses were blocked by WAY100635 in 100% of cases, but not by ritanserin; the excitatory responses were blocked by ritanserin in 75% of cases, but not by WAY100635. The administration of MK-801 potentiated the firing rate of excitatory responses but did not modify the inhibitory responses induced by microiontophoretic application of 5-HT. These results suggest that MK-801 modifies 5-HT synapses in the mPFC by potentiating the excitatory 5-HT(2A/2C) responses and attenuating NMDA excitations. These data indicate that 5-HT excitatory transmission is selectively impaired at the mPFC level in this pharmacological model of schizophrenia.

We show that 1,2-DAB and 2,5-HD lower the abundance of sPDI and THX. However, the protein expression of mPDI is increased in 1,2-DAB axonopathy and neuroproteins became more S-nitrosylated. The abundance of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (neuronal, endothelial, and inducible NOS) remained unchanged suggesting that S-nitrosylation occured via increased mPDI-transnitrosylation and/or diminished THX-denitrosylation. The transcription of PDI and glucose regulated protein-78 (GRP-78) remained unchanged indicating that post-translational modifications, e.g. S-nitrosylation, mediate the pathogenesis of gamma-diketone axonopathy. These findings open opportunities for new therapeutic testing (e.g., supplementation with denitrosylating THX) in gamma-diketone-induced axonal disease.

J	Forlini, C; Racine, E				Forlini, Cynthia; Racine, Eric			Autonomy and Coercion in Academic "Cognitive Enhancement" Using Methylphenidate: Perspectives of Key Stakeholders	NEUROETHICS			English	Article						Cognitive enhancement; Autonomy; Neuroethics; Public understanding; Neuropharmaceuticals	PRESCRIPTION STIMULANTS; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; COSMETIC NEUROLOGY; NONMEDICAL USE; PREVALENCE; SAMPLE; MISUSE; ABUSE; UNDERGRADUATE; BIOETHICS	There is mounting evidence that methylphenidate (MPH; Ritalin) is being used by healthy college students to improve concentration, alertness, and academic performance. One of the key concerns associated with such use of pharmaceuticals is the degree of freedom individuals have to engage in or abstain from cognitive enhancement (CE). From a pragmatic perspective, careful examination of the ethics of acts and contexts in which they arise includes considering coercion and social pressures to enhance cognition. We were interested in understanding how university students, parents of university students, and healthcare providers viewed autonomy and coercion in CE using MPH. We found that perspectives converged on the belief that CE is a matter of personal and individual choice. Perspectives also converged on the existence of tremendous social pressures to perform and succeed. Parents emphasized personal responsibility and accountability for CE choices, and expressed feelings of worry, sadness and fear about CE. Students emphasized the importance of personal integrity in CE, expressed tolerance for personal choices of others, and highlighted the challenge that CE poses to maintaining one's personal integrity. Healthcare providers emphasized the health consequences of CE. These results illustrate: (1) the importance of understanding how context is viewed in relation to perspectives on autonomous choice; (2) the limitations of individualistic libertarian approaches that do not consider social context; and (3) the ethical implications of public health interventions in a value-laden debate where perspectives diverge.

While voice stimuli are known to involve voice-selective areas of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in sighted persons, it remains unknown if the processing of vocal stimuli involves similar brain regions in blind persons, or whether it benefits from cross-modal processing. To address these questions, we used fMRI to measure cerebral responses to voice and non-voice stimuli in blind (congenital and acquired) and sighted subjects. The global comparison of all sounds vs. silence showed a different pattern of activation between blind (pooled congenital and acquired)and sighted groups,with blind subjects showing stronger activation of occipital areas but weaker activation of temporal areas centered around Heschl's gyrus. In contrast, the specific comparison of vocal vs. non-vocal sounds did not isolate activations in the occipital areas in either of the blind groups. In the congenitally blind group, however, it led to a stronger activation in the left STS, and to a lesser extent in the fusiform cortex, compared to both sighted participants and those with acquired blindness. Moreover, STS activity in congenital blind participants significantly correlated with performance in a voice discrimination task. This increased recruitment of STS areas in the blind for voice processing is in marked contrast with the usual cross-modal recruitment of occipital cortex. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, direct comparison of cognitive functions between different types of dementia is necessary for differential diagnosis. Executive dysfunction is common in several types of dementia, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD); however, FTD and LBD patients have never been directly compared on measures of executive functioning. The authors compared the performance of 17 FTD and 15 LBD patients on 6 measures of executive functioning in terms of statistical group differences, mean severity of clinical impairment in comparison to normal controls, and frequency of impairment. Results indicated a remarkably similar pattern of performance across all areas examined in terms of mean performance, as well as degree and frequency of impairment. Only the Stroop test produced results that could potentially differentiate the patient groups. These findings suggest that both FTD and LBD should be considered disorders involving executive dysfunction.

Visual and auditory oddball paradigms were administered at 5 (N = 27) and I I (N = 110) years of age, respectively, to elicit this ERP component. Pearson correlations and multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between Pb levels and P3b parameters (peak latency and amplitude). Greater prenatal Pb exposure was related to a decrease in P3b amplitude at 5 years of age, and early childhood Pb exposure was associated with delayed P3b latency at 5 years. No significant association was observed at 11 years. These results, in line with those from previous neurobehavioral studies, suggest that Pb exposure affects cognitive processing in children even though the Pb levels measured in a large majority of our sample were below the threshold value for public health intervention used by federal agencies. This study strengthens the arguments for reducing sources of Pb exposure in Nunavik and for lowering the blood Pb concentrations considered "acceptable" in governmental policies.

While there is an extensive literature on occupational exposure, few studies have examined adults and children living near important sources of airborne Mn. The objective of this study was to analyze hair Mn of children living in the vicinity of a ferro-manganese alloy production plant in the Great Salvador region, State of Bahia, Brazil and examine factors that influence this bioindicator of exposure. We examined 109 children in the age range of 1-10 years, living near the plant. Four separate housing areas were identified a priori on the bases of proximity to the emission sources and downwind location. A non-exposed group (n = 43) of similar socio-economic status was also evaluated. Mn hair (MnH) concentration was measured by graphite atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). Possible confounding hematological parameters were also assessed. Mean MnH concentration was 15.20 mu g/g (1.10-95.50 mu g/g) for the exposed children and 1.37 mu g/g (0.39-5.58 mu g/g) for the non-exposed. For the former, MnH concentrations were 7.95 +/- 1.40 mu g/g (farthest from the plant). 11.81 +/- 1.11 mu g/g(mid-region), 34.43 +/- 8.66 mu g/g(closest to the plant) and 34.22 +/- 9.15 mu g/g (directly downwind). Multiple regression analysis on log transformed MnH concentrations for the exposed children derived a model that explained 36.8% of the variability. In order of importance, area of children's residence, gender (girls > boys) and time of mother's residence in the area at the birth of the child, were significantly associated with MnH. Post hoc analyses indicated two groupings for exposure areas, with those living closest to and downwind of the plant displaying higher MnH concentrations compared to the others. The contribution of the time the mother lived in the community prior to the child's birth to the children's current MnH suggests that in utero exposure may play a role. A study of neurobehavioral performance with respect to Mn exposure in these children is currently underway. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The family of ADAR enzymes converts some adenosines of RNA duplexes to inosines through hydrolytic deamination. The adenosine recognition mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, to investigate it, we analyzed a set of selectively edited substrates with a cluster of edited sites. We used a large set of individual transcripts sequenced by the 454 sequencing technique. On average, we analyzed 570 single transcripts per edited region at four different developmental stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. To our knowledge, this is the first time, large-scale sequencing has been used to determine synchronous editing events. We demonstrate that edited sites are only coupled within specific distances from each other. Furthermore, our results show that the coupled sites of editing are positioned on the same side of a helix, indicating that the three-dimensional structure is key in ADAR enzyme substrate recognition. Finally, we propose that editing by the ADAR enzymes is initiated by their attraction to one principal site in the substrate.

These central and peripheral clocks are based on clock genes and their protein products. In recent years, the expression of clock genes has started to be investigated in human samples, primarily white blood cells, but also skin, oral mucosa, colon cells, adipose tissue as well as post-mortem brain tissue. The expression of clock genes in those peripheral tissues offers a way to monitor human peripheral clocks and to compare their function and regulation with those of the central clock, which is followed by markers such as melatonin, cortisol and core body temperature. We have recently used such an approach to compare central and peripheral rhythms in subjects under different lighting conditions. In particular, we have monitored the entrainment of the clock of blood cells in subjects undergoing a simulated night shift protocol with bright light treatment, known to efficiently reset the central clock. This line of research will be helpful for learning more about the human circadian system and to find ways to alleviate health problems of shift workers, and other populations experiencing altered circadian rhythms.

The objective of the present study was to further evaluate and detail the time course of this enhanced retinal response. Methods: Twenty healthy adults volunteered for this study. The OPs were recorded with a DTL-type electrode following pupillary dilation and retinal dark adaptation. Stimuli consisted of white flashes. The OPs were recorded at 8 points in time before, during and after breathing pure oxygen (O(2)). The arterial blood O(2) saturation (SaO(2)), end-tidal CO(2) (EtCO(2)), respiratory rate (RR), pulse rate (PR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored throughout the experiment. Results: The amplitude of the OPs did not vary significantly across test conditions except for OP3, which increased with systemic hyperoxia and was still elevated by the end of the experiment. The SaO(2) and RR increased, the EtCO(2) and PR decreased, whereas the BP was not altered during O(2) breathing. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence indicating that the neural generators of OP3 display a unique hyper-reactivity to increased systemic O(2) levels in the young healthy adult. Further studies looking at OP3 are still needed to determine if this unique behavior could serve as an index of altered oxygen level and retinal function in health or disease.

This study was undertaken to investigate the role of AM in a model of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain. Injection of CFA, but not of saline, in the unilateral hindpaw produced an increase in the expression of AM-like immunoreactivity (AM-IR) in larninae I-II of the spinal cord as well as in small- and medium-sized dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons at 48 h. The content of AM in DRG on the side ipsilateral to CFA injection started to increase at 4 h and remained at high levels at 24 and 48 h. The selective antagonist of AM receptors, AM(22-52), administered intrathecally (i.t.) 24 h after CFA injection inhibited inflammation-associated hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner (2, 5 and 10 nmol). Impressively, this anti-hyperalgesic effect lasted for at least 24 h. I.t. administration of AM22-52 (10 nmol) also reversed CFA-induced increase in AM-IR in the spinal dorsal horn and DRG. Furthermore, blockade of AM receptors abolished CFA-induced changes in the expression and content of CGRP-like immunoreactivity in these regions. Taken together, our results suggest that the upregulation of AM in DRG neurons contributes to the development of inflammatory pain, and this effect is mediated, at least in part, by enhancing the expression and release of CGRP. Blocking AM receptor downstream signaling effects using antagonists has the potential of relieving pain following the induction of inflammation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the interobserver reliability of both assessments. Infants between 29 and 37 weeks gestation were examined with the Amiel-Tison Neurological Assessment at Term (n = 33) and with the Amiel-Tison Neurological Assessment From Birth to 6 Years Old (n = 26). The infants were assessed by two examiners, one after and in the absence of the other. The kappa coefficient and percentage of agreement were calculated. The majority of items in both assessments showed an excellent reliability. The kappa coefficient for the final synthesis was also excellent in both cases. Future studies on the predictive validity of both assessments are required to determine their utility in predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. (C) 2009 by Elsevier Inc.

The diagnosis has been broadly inclusive by using a case definition of a facial hemangioma plus >= 1 extracutaneous features, leading to numerous reports of potential associated disease features, many of uncertain significance. This consensus statement was thus developed to establish diagnostic criteria for PHACE syndrome. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of specialists with expertise in PHACE syndrome drafted initial diagnostic criteria on the basis of review of published, peer-reviewed medical literature and clinical experience. The group then convened in both executive and general sessions during the PHACE Syndrome Research Conference held in November 2008 for discussion and used a consensus method. All con. flicting recommendations were subsequently reconciled via electronic communication and teleconferencing. RESULTS: These criteria were stratified into 2 categories: (1) PHACE syndrome or (2) possible PHACE syndrome. Major and minor criteria were determined for the following organ systems: cerebrovascular, structural brain, cardiovascular, ocular, and ventral/midline. Definite PHACE requires the presence of a characteristic segmental hemangioma or hemangioma >5 cm on the face or scalp plus 1 major criterion or 2 minor criteria. Possible PHACE requires the presence of a hemangioma >5 cm on the face or scalp plus 1 minor criterion. The group recognized that it may be possible to have PHACE syndrome with a hemangioma affecting the neck, chest, or arm only or no cutaneous hemangioma at all. In such cases, fulfillment of additional required criteria would also lead to a possible PHACE diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These criteria represent current knowledge and are expected to enhance future assessments of PHACE syndrome. It is understood that modi. cations are to be expected over time to incorporate new research findings.

As human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) play an essential role as structural and functional components in tumor angiogenesis, we assessed whether propranolol could target HBMEC's in vitro angiogenic properties. We found that biopsies from human glioblastoma as well as from experimental brain tumor-associated vasculature expressed high levels of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor, suggesting adrenergic adaptative processes could take place during tumor vascularization. We observed that in vitro tubulogenesis was significantly reduced by propranolol when HBMEC were seeded on Matrigel. Propranolol,as much as 100 mu M, did not reduce cell viability and did not alter HBMEC migration as assessed with Boyden chambers. Secretion of the key angiogenic and extracellular matrix degrading enzymes MMP-2 and MMP-9 was assessed by zymography. Propranolol significantly reduced MMP-9 secretion upon treatment with the tumor-promoting agent phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, while secretion of MMP-2 remained unaffected. This was correlated with a decrease in MMP-9 gene expression which is, in part, explained by a decrease in the nucleocytoplasmic export of the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR. Our data are therefore indicative of a selective role for propranolol in inhibiting MMP-9 secretion and HBMEC tubulogenesis which could potentially add to propranolol's anti-angiogenic properties.

Evaluation of the Oscillatory Interference Model of Grid Cell Firing through Analysis and Measured Period Variance of Some Biological Oscillators	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIAL ENTORHINAL CORTEX; HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS; HIPPOCAMPAL PLACE CELLS; FREELY MOVING RATS; LAYER-III NEURONS; PATH-INTEGRATION; SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS; PERSISTENT ACTIVITY; THETA-RHYTHM; POSITION	Models of the hexagonally arrayed spatial activity pattern of grid cell firing in the literature generally fall into two main categories: continuous attractor models or oscillatory interference models. Burak and Fiete (2009, PLoS Comput Biol) recently examined noise in two continuous attractor models, but did not consider oscillatory interference models in detail. Here we analyze an oscillatory interference model to examine the effects of noise on its stability and spatial firing properties. We show analytically that the square of the drift in encoded position due to noise is proportional to time and inversely proportional to the number of oscillators. We also show there is a relatively fixed breakdown point, independent of many parameters of the model, past which noise overwhelms the spatial signal. Based on this result, we show that a pair of oscillators are expected to maintain a stable grid for approximately t = 5 mu(3)/(4 pi sigma)(2) seconds where mu is the mean period of an oscillator in seconds and sigma(2) its variance in seconds(2). We apply this criterion to recordings of individual persistent spiking neurons in postsubiculum (dorsal presubiculum) and layers III and V of entorhinal cortex, to subthreshold membrane potential oscillation recordings in layer II stellate cells of medial entorhinal cortex and to values from the literature regarding medial septum theta bursting cells. All oscillators examined have expected stability times far below those seen in experimental recordings of grid cells, suggesting the examined biological oscillators are unfit as a substrate for current implementations of oscillatory interference models. However, oscillatory interference models can tolerate small amounts of noise, suggesting the utility of circuit level effects which might reduce oscillator variability. Further implications for grid cell models are discussed.

Adaptive neuro-fuzzy controllers for an open-loop morphing wing system	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART G-JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						morphing; neuro-fuzzy controller; Simulation; modelling; testing	NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION	A new method for the realization of two neuro-fuzzy controllers for a morphing wing design application is presented here. The controllers' main function is to correlate each set of pressure differences, calculated between the optimized and the reference airfoil, with each of the airfoil deformations produced by the actuators' system. The pressures are calculated at different chord positions and will also be measured during wind tunnel tests. During a first identification phase, the two fuzzy inference systems (FISs) from the controllers' structure are generated for 16 flight conditions characterized by Mach numbers and angles of attack. Next, the FIS are optimized with the Matlab function adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) by training over different epochs. Finally, the controllers are validated for the other 33 flight conditions of the open-loop morphing wing system. This is the first time that such a method of relating the pressure differences to airfoil displacements has been conceived and used in an open-loop morphing wing controller system.	[Grigorie, T.

When a reorienting event was presented in the interval between cue and target, IOR was accompanied by reductions in the amplitudes of early occipital ERP peaks oil validly cited trials relative to invalidly cued trials When a reorienting event was not presented, neither IOR nor modulations of the occipital ERP peaks was observed. These results provide strong evidence that IOR arises from changes in occipital visual processing We propose that IOR arises from a slowing of response-selection processes on validly cited trials due differences in the perceptual input to the decision-making process	[Prime, David J.; Jolicoeur, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H2V 2B1, Canada	Prime, DJ (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H2V 2B1, Canada.							50	18	22	1	5	WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC	MALDEN	COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA	0048-5772			PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY	Psychophysiology	NOV	2009	46	6					1278	1287		10.1111/j.1469-8986.2009.00858.x		10	Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental	Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology	510OJ	WOS:000271099100019	19572908	No			2017-07-26	
J	Cervero, F				Cervero, Fernando			Pain: Friend or Foe? A Neurobiologic Perspective The 2008 Bonica Award Lecture	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							DORSAL-ROOT REFLEXES; PRESYNAPTIC INHIBITION; INTRADERMAL INJECTION; NKCC1 COTRANSPORTER; CHLORIDE REGULATION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MECHANISMS; NEURONS; RAT; HYPERALGESIA	Pain is a protective sensation, but it can also be a burden without any useful value. Pain as a friend warns of impending damage and protects the body from injury. Pain as a foe is a useless sensation that makes the underlying problem worse and becomes a disease in its own right. Mechanistically, the systems that mediate good pain and bad pain are often the same, with bad pain being the result of such mechanisms being triggered inappropriately, by irrelevant stimuli or with a time course and intensity disproportionate to the originating cause. We are beginning to know more about the neurobiology of bad pain. The relevant mechanisms are often linked to dysfunction or disease of the nervous system, either of the peripheral nerves or of the central nervous system itself For example, under normal conditions, activity in large, myelinated A beta-fibers, inhibits nociceptive primary afferent inputs to the central nervous system. However, in inflammatory and neuropathic conditions, these actions are reversed, leading to touch-evoked pain or tactile allodynia. The mechanism responsible for this reversal is a change in the synaptic actions of gamma-aminobutyric acid that switches from being an inhibitory neurotransmitter to an excitatory one. Our challenge was to devise methods for pain relief based on elimination of the useless aspects of pain and the restoration of the protective qualifies of normal pain sensation.

Previous cross-sectional structural neuroimaging research has suggested that normal cortical asymmetry patterns [(R - L/(R + L)] may be altered in adult schizophrenia, although these findings were not well replicated. Recent studies show dynamic changes in brain asymmetry during childhood and adolescence. We hypothesized that COS patients would show a lack of normal development of asymmetry and decreased overall asymmetry. Methods: Prospective structural magnetic resonance scans were obtained at baseline and at two-year follow-up visits in 49 right-handed COS patients (mean baseline age: 14.72 +/- 2.63, 117 scans) and 50 age and sex-matched, right-handed healthy controls (mean baseline age: 15.15 +/- 3.37, 125 scans). Cortical thickness was calculated at 40,962 homologous points across each cerebral hemisphere using a fully automated, validated method. Differences in developmental asymmetry patterns across the cortical surface were analyzed using a linear mixed effects regression model. Results: No significant asymmetry differences were found either for cross-sectional comparisons of COS and healthy controls across the lateral and medial cortical surfaces or with respect to timing of developmental changes in asymmetry. Conclusions: The present findings do not support asymmetry differences for this severe, early form of schizophrenia. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The clam population metrics were age distribution, growth, condition factor, distance of the clam beds from the shore. and gonad development. Physiological biomarkers comprised biomarkers of defence such as superoxide dismutase, labile fib metals in tissues, redox status of metallothioneins and glutathione S-transferase, of tissue damage such as lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks, of reproduction as determined by vitellogenin-like proteins and gonadosomatic index and immunocompetence such as phagocytosis and hemocyte viability. Age-related pigments were also examined to compare the physiological age of the clams with their chronological age. The results showed that all the above biomarkers were significantly affected at one of the two polluted sites at least. Distance from the shore was significantly correlated with most (81%) of the biomarkers examined. Clams collected at one polluted site were physiologically older than clams from the corresponding reference site. Canonical and adaptive regression (artificial neural networks) analyses found that the biomarkers measured in this study were able to predict the ecologically relevant endpoints. Biomarkers implicated in defense mechanisms, tissue damage and age-related pigments were most closely related to the clam population characteristics. Sensitivity analysis of the learning algorithm found that the following physiological and biochemical markers were the most predictive, in decreasing order, of clam population characteristics: glutathione S-transferase, phagocytosis, age pigments, lipid peroxidation in the gills, labile fib metals and total MT levels. These biomarkers were affected by the distance of the clam beds from the shore, site quality (pollution) and reproduction activity. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The design and characterization of these devices are of particular interest in frequency discrimination tasks and investigations of the somatopic organization of sensory areas. However, few have investigated the utility of vibrotactile stimulation in a clinical context. We have previously demonstrated that vibrotactile stimulation can provide robust activations in areas targeted in stereotactic functional neurosurgical procedures used for turnout resection (i.e.: primary and secondary somatosensory areas) and subcortical targets for thalamic pain and movement disorders (i.e.: sensory thalamus). The main contribution of this manuscript is the presentation of the design, materials, construction, and validation of a novel vibrotactile stimulator intended for clinical use. The thalamic activations are also compared to a digital atlas in order to evaluate anatomical localization. The proposed stimulator was constructed entirely from non-ferromagnetic parts. uses compressed air to deliver stimulation using computer control, and stimulates the entirety of the hand and fingers to ensure robust somatosensory activations. In addition, this stimulator is constructed entirely from "off-the-shelf" parts and would be easily replicated due to the simplicity of design and the relatively small expense of the parts required. The device was tested by stimulating the right hand of 10 normal controls (5 females, 5 males, all right handed; age range: 25-42 years, mean: 30.9 years, standard deviation: 5.2 years) during an fMRI experiment. The results demonstrate significant single subject activations of primary and secondary somatosensory cortices and of the sensory thalamus. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pattern Motion Selectivity of Spiking Outputs and Local Field Potentials in Macaque Visual Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CORTICAL AREA MT; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; STIMULUS CONTRAST; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; NEURONS; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES	The dorsal pathway of the primate visual cortex is involved in the processing of motion signals that are useful for perception and behavior. Along this pathway, motion information is first measured by the primary visual cortex (V1), which sends specialized projections to extrastriate regions such as the middle temporal area (MT). Previous work with plaid stimuli has shown that most V1 neurons respond to the individual components of moving stimuli, whereas some MT neurons are capable of estimating the global motion of the pattern. In this work, we show that the majority of neurons in the medial superior temporal area (MST), which receives input from MT, have this pattern-selective property. Interestingly, the local field potentials (LFPs) measured simultaneously with the spikes often exhibit properties similar to that of the presumptive feedforward input to each area: in the high-gamma frequency band, the LFPs in MST are as component selective as the spiking outputs of MT, and MT LFPs have plaid responses that are similar to the spiking outputs of V1. In the lower LFP frequency bands (beta and low gamma), component selectivity is very common, and pattern selectivity is almost entirely absent in both MT and MST. Together, these results suggest a surprisingly strong link between the sensory tuning of cortical LFPs and afferent inputs, with important implications for the interpretation of imaging studies and for models of cortical function.

WHO ISBRA Study State Trait Marker	Genetical genomic determinants of alcohol consumption in rats and humans	BMC BIOLOGY			English	Review							VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; PROTEASE-ACTIVATED RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPAL DENTATE GYRUS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GABAERGIC TRANSMISSION; ETHANOL INTAKE; MELANOCORTIN-4 RECEPTOR; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; CANDIDATE GENES; FOOD-INTAKE	Background: We have used a genetical genomic approach, in conjunction with phenotypic analysis of alcohol consumption, to identify candidate genes that predispose to varying levels of alcohol intake by HXB/BXH recombinant inbred rat strains. In addition, in two populations of humans, we assessed genetic polymorphisms associated with alcohol consumption using a custom genotyping array for 1,350 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our goal was to ascertain whether our approach, which relies on statistical and informatics techniques, and non-human animal models of alcohol drinking behavior, could inform interpretation of genetic association studies with human populations. Results: In the HXB/BXH recombinant inbred (RI) rats, correlation analysis of brain gene expression levels with alcohol consumption in a two-bottle choice paradigm, and filtering based on behavioral and gene expression quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses, generated a list of candidate genes. A literature-based, functional analysis of the interactions of the products of these candidate genes defined pathways linked to presynaptic GABA release, activation of dopamine neurons, and postsynaptic GABA receptor trafficking, in brain regions including the hypothalamus, ventral tegmentum and amygdala. The analysis also implicated energy metabolism and caloric intake control as potential influences on alcohol consumption by the recombinant inbred rats. In the human populations, polymorphisms in genes associated with GABA synthesis and GABA receptors, as well as genes related to dopaminergic transmission, were associated with alcohol consumption. Conclusion: Our results emphasize the importance of the signaling pathways identified using the non-human animal models, rather than single gene products, in identifying factors responsible for complex traits such as alcohol consumption. The results suggest cross-species similarities in pathways that influence predisposition to consume alcohol by rats and humans. The importance of a well-defined phenotype is also illustrated. Our results also suggest that different genetic factors predispose alcohol dependence versus the phenotype of alcohol consumption.

While inappropriate over-expression of the progranulin gene has been associated with many cancers, haploinsufficiency leads to atrophy of the frontotemporal lobes and development of a form of dementia (frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin positive inclusions, FTLD-U) associated with the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions. Recent reports indicate that progranulin has neurotrophic effects, which, if confirmed would make progranulin the only neuroprotective growth factor that has been associated genetically with a neurological disease in humans. Preliminary studies indicated high progranulin gene expression in spinal cord motor neurons. However, it is uncertain what the role of Progranulin is in normal or diseased motor neuron function. We have investigated progranulin gene expression and subcellular localization in cultured mouse embryonic motor neurons and examined the effect of progranulin over-expression and knockdown in the NSC-34 immortalized motor neuron cell line upon proliferation and survival. Results: In situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical techniques revealed that the progranulin gene is highly expressed by motor neurons within the mouse spinal cord and in primary cultures of dissociated mouse embryonic spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia. Confocal microscopy coupled to immunocytochemistry together with the use of a progranulin-green fluorescent protein fusion construct revealed progranulin to be located within compartments of the secretory pathway including the Golgi apparatus. Stable transfection of the human progranulin gene into the NSC-34 motor neuron cell line stimulates the appearance of dendritic structures and provides sufficient trophic stimulus to survive serum deprivation for long periods (up to two months). This is mediated at least in part through an anti-apoptotic mechanism. Control cells, while expressing basal levels of progranulin do not survive in serum free conditions. Knockdown of progranulin expression using shRNA technology further reduced cell survival. Conclusion: Neurons are among the most long-lived cells in the body and are subject to low levels of toxic challenges throughout life. We have demonstrated that progranulin is abundantly expressed in motor neurons and is cytoprotective over prolonged periods when over-expressed in a neuronal cell line. This work highlights the importance of progranulin as neuroprotective growth factor and may represent a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases including motor neuron disease.

Protein Kinase C Mediates the Synergistic Interaction Between Agonists Acting at alpha(2)-Adrenergic and Delta-Opioid Receptors in Spinal Cord	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SUBSTANTIA-GELATINOSA NEURONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; DORSAL-ROOT GANGLIA; ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; NORADRENERGIC AGONISTS; INTRATHECAL MORPHINE; SUPERFICIAL LAYERS; AXON TERMINALS; HORN NEURONS	Coactivation of spinal alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (ARs) and opioid receptors produces antinociceptive synergy. Antinociceptive synergy between intrathecally administered alpha(2)AR and opioid agonists is well documented, but the mechanism underlying this synergy remains unclear. The delta-opioid receptor (DOP) and the alpha(2A)ARs are coexpressed on the terminals of primary afferent fibers in the spinal cord where they may mediate this phenomenon. We evaluated the ability of the DOP-selective agonist deltorphin II (DELT), the alpha(2)AR agonist clonidine (CLON) or their combination to inhibit calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release from spinal cord slices. We then examined the possible underlying signaling mechanisms involved through coadministration of inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC) or protein kinase A (PKA). Potassium-evoked depolarization of spinal cord slices caused concentration-dependent release of CGRP. Coadministration of DELT and CLON inhibited the release of CGRP in a synergistic manner as confirmed statistically by isobolograpic analysis. Synergy was dependent on the activation of PLC and PKC, but not PKA, whereas the effect of agonist administration alone was only dependent on PLC. The importance of these findings was confirmed in vivo, using a thermal nociceptive test, demonstrating the PKC dependence of CLON-DELT antinociceptive synergy in mice. That inhibition of CGRP release by the combination was maintained in the presence of tetrodotoxin in spinal cord slices suggests that synergy does not rely on interneuronal signaling and may occur within single subcellular compartments. The present study reveals a novel signaling pathway underlying the synergistic analgesic interaction between DOP and alpha(2)AR agonists in the spinal cord.

In the present study, we investigated whether an early electrophysiological difference between voice and non-voice stimuli could be observed. Results: ERPs were recorded from 32 healthy volunteers who listened to 200 ms long stimuli from three sound categories - voices, bird songs and environmental sounds - whilst performing a pure-tone detection task. ERP analyses revealed voice/non-voice amplitude differences emerging as early as 164 ms post stimulus onset and peaking around 200 ms on fronto-temporal (positivity) and occipital (negativity) electrodes. Conclusion: Our electrophysiological results suggest a rapid brain discrimination of sounds of voice, termed the "fronto-temporal positivity to voices" (FTPV), at latencies comparable to the well-known face-preferential N170.

The Rewarding Aspects of Music Listening Are Related to Degree of Emotional Arousal	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STRIATAL DOPAMINE RELEASE; GALVANIC SKIN-RESPONSES; HEART-RATE; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; UNPLEASANT MUSIC; MOOD INDUCTION; STIMULI; CHILLS; BRAIN; CORRELATE	Background: Listening to music is amongst the most rewarding experiences for humans. Music has no functional resemblance to other rewarding stimuli, and has no demonstrated biological value, yet individuals continue listening to music for pleasure. It has been suggested that the pleasurable aspects of music listening are related to a change in emotional arousal, although this link has not been directly investigated. In this study, using methods of high temporal sensitivity we investigated whether there is a systematic relationship between dynamic increases in pleasure states and physiological indicators of emotional arousal, including changes in heart rate, respiration, electrodermal activity, body temperature, and blood volume pulse. Methodology: Twenty-six participants listened to self-selected intensely pleasurable music and "neutral'' music that was individually selected for them based on low pleasure ratings they provided on other participants' music. The "chills'' phenomenon was used to index intensely pleasurable responses to music. During music listening, continuous real-time recordings of subjective pleasure states and simultaneous recordings of sympathetic nervous system activity, an objective measure of emotional arousal, were obtained. Principal Findings: Results revealed a strong positive correlation between ratings of pleasure and emotional arousal. Importantly, a dissociation was revealed as individuals who did not experience pleasure also showed no significant increases in emotional arousal. Conclusions/Significance: These results have broader implications by demonstrating that strongly felt emotions could be rewarding in themselves in the absence of a physically tangible reward or a specific functional goal.

Dendrite branching and self-avoidance are controlled by Turtle, a conserved IgSF protein in Drosophila	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Neuron; Dendrite; Drosophila; Arborization; Repulsion	SENSORY NEURONS; REQUIRE DSCAM; MORPHOGENESIS; ARBORIZATION; ROBO; ROLES; EXPRESSION; FLAMINGO; SYSTEM; MEMBER	The dendritic trees of neurons result from specific patterns of growth and branching, and dendrite branches of the same neuron avoid one another to spread over a particular receptive field. Recognition molecules on the surfaces of dendrites influence these patterning and avoidance processes by promoting attractive, repulsive or adhesive responses to specific cues. The Drosophila transmembrane protein Turtle (Tutl) and its orthologs in other species are conserved members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the in vivo functions of which are unknown. In Drosophila sensory neurons, we show that the tutl gene is required to restrain dendrite branch formation in neurons with simple arbors, and to promote dendrite self-avoidance in neurons with complex arbors. The cytoplasmic tail of Tutl is dispensable for control of dendrite branching, suggesting that Tutl acts as a ligand or co-receptor for an unidentified recognition molecule to influence the architecture of dendrites and their coverage of receptive territories.

Such studies present significant surgical risks, and high degrees of uncertainty about intervention risks and biological effects. We argue that maintaining a favorable risk-benefit balance in such circumstances requires a higher than usual degree of confidence that protocols will lead to significant direct and/or social benefits. One critical way of promoting such confidence is through the application of stringent evidentiary standards for preclinical studies. We close with a series of recommendations for strengthening the internal and external validity of preclinical studies, reducing their tendency toward optimism and publication biases, and improving the knowledge base used to design and evaluate preclinical studies.

Systematic review of the literature. Objective. Should cement augmentation procedures such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty be used in patients with painful compression fractures associated with metastatic spine disease? What is the role of embolization in the treatment of metastatic spine disease? Summary of Background Data. Vertebral augmentation is commonly employed in treating osteoporotic fractures and is now increasingly used in the management of pain in patients with spinal tumors. Intra-arterial and transcutaneous embolization techniques are also available in the management of spinal tumors. To date, the effectiveness and safety of these procedures have not been adequately demonstrated. Methods. A review of the English literature was performed in Pub-Med. One search was performed using the following keywords: cancer, tumor, vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, vertebral augmentation, outcome, safety, pain, and quality of life. A Second search was performed using the keywords: embolization, spinal, and tumors. Original studies reporting on at least 10 patients were included and systematically reviewed. The results were reviewed and discussed through consensus among a multidisciplinary panel of expert members of the Spine Oncology Study Group. Recommendations were made according to the Guyatt Guidelines. Results. A total of 1665 abstracts were identified. Twenty-eight articles using vertebroplasty reported on 877 patients and 1599 treated levels. Medical and neurologic complications varied from 0% to 7.1% and 0% to 8.1%, respectively. Twelve articles using kyphoplasty reported on 333 patients and 481 treated levels. Medical complication rates varied from 0% to 0.5%, without any neurologic complications. Pain and functional outcomes were universally successful using either technique. Ten studies on embolization reported on 330 patients. There were 4 permanent complications (1.4%). Complete or partial embolization was possible in 97.5% with an estimated reduction of intraoperative blood loss of 2.3 L. Conclusion. There is strong recommendation and moderate evidence for vertebral augmentation as safe and effective in providing pain relief and improving functional outcome in patients with vertebral body fractures and axial pain due to metastatic disease. There is a strong recommendation and very low evidence for embolization techniques as safe and effective in decreasing intraoperative blood loss in hypervascular tumors.

Methods: To extend these recent genetic reports, we screened the entire gene in a cohort of 200 patients with ALS. An additional 285 patients with sporadic ALS were screened for variants in exon 15 for which mutations were previously reported. Results: In total, 3 different mutations were identified in 4 different patients, including 1 3-bp deletion in exon 3 of a patient with sporadic ALS and 2 missense mutations in exon 15 of 1 patient with familial ALS and 2 patients with sporadic ALS. Conclusions: Our study identified sporadic patients with mutations in the FUS gene. The accumulation and description of different genes and mutations helps to develop a more comprehensive picture of the genetic events underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Protein Misfolding as an Underlying Molecular Defect in Mucopolysaccharidosis III Type C	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GLUCOSAMINIDE N-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISORDERS; DISEASE TYPE-C; SANFILIPPO-SYNDROME; ACETYL-COA; TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN; SKIN FIBROBLASTS; PURIFICATION; NETHERLANDS; PREVALENCE	Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC or Sanfilippo syndrome type C (MPS IIIC, MIM #252930) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal membrane enzyme, heparan sulfate acetyl-CoA: alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT, EC 2.3.1.78), which catalyses transmembrane acetylation of the terminal glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate prior to their hydrolysis by alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Lysosomal storage of undegraded heparan sulfate in the cells of affected patients leads to neuronal death causing neurodegeneration and is accompanied by mild visceral and skeletal abnormalities, including coarse facies and joint stiffness. Surprisingly, the majority of MPS IIIC patients carrying missense mutations are as severely affected as those with splicing errors, frame shifts or nonsense mutations resulting in the complete absence of HGSNAT protein. In order to understand the effects of the missense mutations in HGSNAT on its enzymatic activity and biogenesis, we have expressed 21 mutant proteins in cultured human fibroblasts and COS-7 cells and studied their folding, targeting and activity. We found that 17 of the 21 missense mutations in HGSNAT caused misfolding of the enzyme, which is abnormally glycosylated and not targeted to the lysosome, but retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The other 4 mutants represented rare polymorphisms which had no effect on the activity, processing and targeting of the enzyme. Treatment of patient cells with a competitive HGSNAT inhibitor, glucosamine, partially rescued several of the expressed mutants. Altogether our data provide an explanation for the severity of MPS IIIC and suggest that search for pharmaceutical chaperones can in the future result in therapeutic options for this disease.

Comparative processing of emotional prosody and semantics following basal ganglia infarcts: ERP evidence of selective impairments for disgust and fear	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory; Perception; Emotional speech; Language; Basal ganglia	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; IMPAIRED RECOGNITION; NEURAL RESPONSES; SPEECH; LANGUAGE; COMPREHENSION; HUNTINGTONS	There is evidence from neuroimaging and clinical studies that functionally link the basal ganglia to emotional speech processes. However, in most previous studies, explicit tasks were administered. Thus, the underlying mechanisms substantiating emotional speech are not separated from possibly process-related task effects. Therefore, the current study tested emotional speech processing in an event-related potential (ERP) experiment using an implicit emotional processing task (probe verification). The interactive time course of emotional prosody in the context of emotional semantics was investigated using a cross-splicing method. As previously demonstrated, combined prosodic and semantic expectancy violations elicit N400-like negativities irrespective of emotional categories in healthy listeners. In contrast, basal ganglia patients show this negativity only for the emotions of happiness and anger, but not for fear or disgust. The current data serve as first evidence that lesions within the left basal ganglia affect the comparative online processing of fear and disgust prosody and semantics. Furthermore, the data imply that previously reported emotional speech recognition deficits in basal ganglia patients may be due to misaligned processing of emotional prosody and semantics.

Acrolein induces a cellular stress response and triggers mitochondrial apoptosis in A549 cells	CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Acrolein; Apoptosis; Mitochondria; AKT; Inhibitor of apoptosis protein; Oxidative stress	HAMSTER OVARY CELLS; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; CYTOCHROME-C; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSES; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; CASPASE ACTIVITY; JURKAT CELLS	Acrolein is a highly reactive, alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde that is an omnipresent environmental pollutant. Humans are exposed to acrolein in food, vapors of overheated cooking oil, cigarette smoke and by combustion of organic products. Acrolein is a toxic by-product of lipid peroxidation resulting from oxidative stress, which is implicated in pulmonary, cardiac and neurodegenerative diseases. Low dose exposure to toxic compounds often leads to adaptive responses. if the adaptive response does not counteract the adverse exposure, death processes such as apoptosis will eliminate the cell. This study investigates the activation of antiapoptosis survival factors in relation to the induction of cell death by apoptosis, following exposure to low doses of acrolein, in A549 human lung cells. Exposure to acrolein (<15 mu M, 30 min) activated the survival factor AKT, which led to phosphorylation of Bad and induction of antiapoptosis proteins clAP1/2. Acrolein (10-50 mu M, 30-60 min) increased reactive oxygen species and caused mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarisation. Inhibition by the antioxidants catalase, polyethylene glycol-catalase, sodium pyruvate and MnTBAP showed that acrolein-induced reactive oxygen species were responsible for mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarisation. Acrolein (3-27 mu M, 30-60 min) activated early stage processes in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, such as Bax translocation to mitochondria, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activation, and translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor to the nucleus. Acrolein (10-50 mu M) triggered later stage processes such as activation of caspases-3, -7 and -6, phosphatidylserine externalization and cleavage of poly(ADP)ribose polymerase after longer times (2h). These events were inhibited by polyethylene glycol-catalase, showing that apoptosis was mediated by overproduction of reactive oxygen species by acrolein. The novel findings show that antiapoptosis processes dominate at low dose (<15 mu M)/shorter exposure times to acrolein, whereas proapoptotic processes dominate at higher dose (10-50 mu M)/longer exposure times. Acrolein induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway that was mediated by reactive oxygen species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rapid Assembly of Functional Presynaptic Boutons Triggered by Adhesive Contacts	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HEPARAN-SULFATE PROTEOGLYCANS; ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT REGULATION; SYNAPTIC VESICLE EXOCYTOSIS; CELL-ADHESION; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; ACTIN CYTOSKELETON; SELECTIVE STABILIZATION; CHEMICAL CONNECTIONS; EXCITATORY SYNAPSES; DENDRITIC SPINES	CNS synapse assembly typically follows after stable contacts between "appropriate" axonal and dendritic membranes are made. We show that presynaptic boutons selectively form de novo following neuronal fiber adhesion to beads coated with poly-D-lysine (PDL), an artificial cationic polypeptide. As demonstrated by atomic force and live confocal microscopy, functional presynaptic boutons self-assemble as rapidly as 1 h after bead contact, and are found to contain a variety of proteins characteristic of presynaptic endings. Interestingly, presynaptic compartment assembly does not depend on the presence of a biological postsynaptic membrane surface. Rather, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, including syndecan-2, as well as others possibly adsorbed onto the bead matrix or expressed on the axon surface, are required for assembly to proceed by a mechanism dependent on the dynamic reorganization of F-actin. Our results indicate that certain ( but not all) nonspecific cationic molecules like PDL, with presumably electrostatically mediated adhesive properties, can effectively bypass cognate and natural postsynaptic ligands to trigger presynaptic assembly in the absence of specific target recognition. In contrast, we find that postsynaptic compartment assembly depends on the prior presence of a mature presynaptic ending.

The authors have sought to expand their previous findings implicating altered expression of spermidine/spermine N-1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), the rate-limiting enzyme involved in catabolism of the polyamines spermidine and spermine in the polyamine stress response (PSR), across multiple brain regions between control individuals and depressed individuals who have died by suicide. Microarray expression of probesets annotated to SAT1 were examined across 17 brain regions in 13 controls and 26 individuals who have died by suicide (16 with a diagnosis of major depression and 10 without), all of French-Canadian origin. Profiling conducted on the Affymetrix U133A/B chipset was further examined on a second chipset (U133 Plus 2.0) using RT-PCR, and analyzed in a second, independent sample. A reduction in SAT1 expression identified through multiple probesets was observed across 12 cortical regions in depressed individuals who have died by suicide compared with controls. Of these, five cortical regions showed statistically significant reductions which were supported by RT-PCR and analysis on the additional chipset. SAT1 cortical expression levels were also found to be significantly lower in an independent sample of German subjects with major depression who died by suicide in comparison with controls. These findings suggest that down-regulation of SAT1 expression may play a role in depression and suicidality, possibly by impeding the normal PSR program or through compensation for the increased polyamine metabolism accompanying the psychological distress associated with depressive disorders.

Several integrative properties of these ganglia have been described: convergence of central inputs, projection of visceral inputs at the pre- and post synaptic level and pacemaker activity of the neurones. This review presents the results obtained on another integrative property which has been widely studied over the last 10 years: the modulation of the fast central inputs by neuromodulators such as nitric oxide, ceramide and GABA. These substances facilitate or inhibit the fast central inputs through complex interrelated actions. We also present striking results recently obtained during the study of a regulatory reflex of the digestive tract motility organized by the prevertebral ganglia: the gastro-duodenal inhibitory reflex. During this reflex, the neurotransmitter released by the visceral afferent fibres to activate the ganglionic neurones is gaseous: nitric oxide. Moreover, the mechanism conducting the excitation along the afferent and efferent fibres is independent of action potentials. This mechanism requires the integrity of the membrane lipid rafts and the activation in cascade of the following second messenger sequence: ceramide, calcium, nitric oxide and guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate. The existence of this mechanism gives grounds for rethinking one of the central dogmas in neuroscience according to which excitation is only conducted along nerves by an electrical phenomenon, the action potential. All these results strengthen the role of the prevertebral ganglia as a model for the study of neuronal networks and basic neuronal properties. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Clavesin Family, Neuron-specific Lipid-and Clathrin-binding Sec14 Proteins Regulating Lysosomal Morphology	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TYROSINE-PHOSPHATASE MEG2; TRANS-GOLGI NETWORK; PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3,5-BISPHOSPHATE; MEMBRANE TRAFFICKING; EARLY ENDOSOMES; DOMAIN; IDENTIFICATION; MOTIF; VESICLES; DISTINCT	Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) originating from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) provide a major transport pathway from the secretory system to endosomes/lysosomes. Herein we describe paralogous Sec14 domain-bearing proteins, clavesin 1/CRALBPL and clavesin 2, identified through a proteomic analysis of CCVs. Clavesins are enriched on CCVs and form a complex with clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and adaptor protein-1, major coat components of TGN-derived CCVs. The proteins co-localize with markers of endosomes and the TGN as well as with CHC and adaptor protein-1. A membrane mimic assay using the Sec14 domain of clavesin 1 reveals phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate as a specific lipid partner. Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate is localized to late endosomes/lysosomes, and interestingly, isoform-specific knockdown of clavesins in neurons using lentiviral delivery of interfering RNA leads to enlargement of a lysosome-associated membrane protein 1-positive membrane compartment with no obvious influence on the CCV machinery at the TGN. Since clavesins are expressed exclusively in neurons, this new protein family appears to provide a unique neuron-specific regulation of late endosome/lysosome morphology.

Methods Ninety-two right-handed patients who had left-sided lesions (tumors, focal cortical dysplasia, and vascular lesions) and 19 right-handed normal subjects were included and synonym generation task was used for evaluation of language lateralization. Results As expected, the majority of individuals in both groups showed left hemisphere dominance. Lesions in the vicinity of language-related areas did not alter patterns of activation responses. However, atypical inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activations (33.6%) were more commonly observed in the patient group than in the control group (21%). There were no clear right-sided IFG activations in the control group but almost 28% of the patients showed clear right-sided IFG activations. Atypical language lateralization was strongly correlated with duration of seizure (p = 0.01) and early age at onset (p = 0.03). Conclusions Our data provide evidence for inter-hemispheric plasticity related to language function as a response to lesions involving the left hemisphere. A better understanding of the dynamic organization of the brain and about the interaction between the lesion and reactional plasticity will lead to changes in surgical strategy, which will enable us to perform a total removal of the lesion involving eloquent brain areas with improved functional outcome.

VRQ397 (CRAVKY): a novel noncompetitive V2 receptor antagonist. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 297: R1009-R1018, 2009. First published July 29, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.90766.2008.-Vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R) exhibits mostly important properties for hydroosmotic equilibrium and, to a lesser extent, on vasomotricity. Drugs currently acting on this receptor are analogs of the natural neuropeptide, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and hence are competitive ligands. Peptides that reproduce specific sequences of a given receptor have lately been reported to interfere with its action, and if such molecules arise from regions remote from the binding site they would be anticipated to exhibit noncompetitive antagonism, but this has yet to be shown for V2R. Six peptides reproducing juxtamembranous regions of V2R were designed and screened; the most effective peptide, cravky (labeled VRQ397), was characterized. VRQ397 was potent (IC(50) = 0.69 +/- 0.25 nM) and fully effective in inhibiting V2R-dependent physiological function, specifically desmopressin-L-desamino-8-arginine-vasopressin (DDAVP)-induced cremasteric vasorelaxation; this physiological functional assay was utilized to avoid overlooking interference of specific signaling events. A dose-response profile revealed a noncompetitive property of VRQ397; correspondingly, VRQ397 bound specifically to V2R-expressing cells could not displace its natural ligand, AVP, but modulated AVP binding kinetics (dissociation rate). Specificity of VRQ397 was further confirmed by its inability to bind to homologous V1 and oxytocin receptors and its inefficacy to alter responses to stimulation of these receptors. VRQ397 exhibited pharmacological permissiveness on V2R-induced signals, as it inhibited DDAVP-induced PGI(2) generation but not that of cAMP or recruitment of beta-arrestin2. Consistent with in vitro and ex vivo effects as a V2R antagonist, VRQ397 displayed anticipated in vivo aquaretic efficacy. We hereby describe the discovery of a first potent noncompetitive antagonist of V2R, which exhibits functional selectivity, in line with properties of a negative allosteric modulator.

In birds, foraging innovations have been observed in over 800 species, and include behaviours that range from eating a novel food to using tools. Previous comparative studies have quantified innovativeness by summing all reports of innovative behaviour, regardless of the nature of the innovation. Here, we use the variety of foraging innovations recorded for birds to see which of two classic hypotheses best accounts for the relationship between innovativeness and brain size: the technical intelligence hypothesis or the opportunistic-generalism intelligence hypothesis. We classified 2182 innovation cases into 12 categories to quantify the diversity of innovations performed by each of 76 avian families. We found that families with larger brains had a greater repertoire of innovations, and that innovation diversity was a stronger predictor of residual brain size than was total number of innovations. Furthermore, the diversity of technical innovations displayed by bird families was a much better predictor of residual brain size than was the number of food type innovations, providing support for the technical intelligence hypothesis. Our results suggest that the cognitive capacity required to perform a wide variety of novel foraging techniques underpins the positive relationship between innovativeness and brain size in birds. We include a summary of innovation data for 803 species as Supplementary Material. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Preclinical and clinical trials, as well as tests carried out on both humans and animals (rats. dogs, cats) demonstrated certain qualities of this hydrolysate. It shows a marked affinity for GABA-A receptors with a benzodiazepine-like profile and a tranquilizing and antistress activity associated with good tolerance characterized, in particular, by the absence of any habituation, dependence, sedation, memory impairment and toxicity. THC is a nutritional supplement (French regulatory status) which cannot be used its a substitute for psychotropes, such as benzodiazepines, in the treatment of severe anxiety and sleep disorders in respect of the medical recommendations. However, it could be effective in cases of slighter signs of these disorders. It could also be appropriate in the medical prevention and follow-up of subjects who have difficulty adapting to changes and stressful situations of daily life. An original pilot clinical trial respecting good practice and representative of the cases observed by General Practitioners (GPs) showed the interest of a global management program for benzodiazepine withdrawal. This global management program which included the use of THC opened a new application for it in general practice. As a result of a certain neuropsychiatric similarity between man and the domestic dog, we took the opportunity of presenting this natural tranquillizer in its application in both human and veterinary medicine.

OLYMPUS Trial Grp	Rituximab in Patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Results of a Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Multicenter Trial	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							INNATE IMMUNE-SYSTEM; INTERFERON BETA-1A; AGED MICE; B-CELLS; INFLAMMATION; DAMAGE; EVENT; MRI; NEUROINFLAMMATION; AUTOANTIBODIES	Objective: Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody selectively depleting CD20+ B cells, has demonstrated efficacy in reducing disease activity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). We evaluated rituximab in adults with primary progressive MS (PPMS) through 96 weeks and safety through 122 weeks. Methods: Using 2:1 randomization, 439 PPMS patients received two 1,000mg intravenous rituximab or placebo infusions every 24 weeks, through 96 weeks (4 courses). The primary endpoint was time to confirmed disease progression (CDP), a prespecified increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale sustained for 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints were change from baseline to week 96 in T2 lesion volume and total brain volume on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results: Differences in time to CDP between rituximab and placebo did not reach significance (96-week rates: 38.5% placebo, 30.2% rituximab; p = 0.14). From baseline to week 96, rituximab patients had less (p < 0.001) increase in T2 lesion volume; brain volume change was similar (p = 0.62) to placebo. Subgroup analysis showed time to CDP was delayed in rituximab-treated patients aged <51 years (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52; p = 0.010), those with gadolinium-enhancing lesions (HR = 0.41; P = 0.007), and those aged <51 years with gadolinium-enhancing lesions (HR = 0.33; p = 0.009) compared with placebo. Adverse events were comparable between groups; 16.1% of rituximab and 13.6% of placebo patients reported serious events. Serious infections occurred in 4.5% of rituximab and <1.0% of placebo patients. Infusion-related events, predominantly mild to moderate, were more common with rituximab during the first course, and decreased to rates comparable to placebo on successive courses. Interpretation: Although time to CDP between groups was not significant, overall subgroup analyses suggest selective B-cell depletion may affect disease progression in younger patients, particularly those with inflammatory lesions.

SCARB2 Mutations in Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy (PME) Without Renal Failure	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							DISEASE; EPM1	Objective: Mutations in SCARB2 were recently described as causing action myoclonus renal failure syndrome (AMRF). We hypothesized that mutations in SCARB2 might account for unsolved cases of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) without renal impairment, especially those resembling Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD). Additionally, we searched for mutations in the PRICKLE1 gene, newly recognized as a cause of PME mimicking ULD. Methods: We reviewed cases of PME referred for diagnosis over two decades in which a molecular diagnosis had not been reached. Patients were classified according to age of onset, clinical pattern, and associated neurological signs into "ULD-like" and "not ULD-like." After exclusion of mutations in cystatin B (CSTB), DNA was examined for sequence variation in SCARB2 and PRICKLE1. Results: Of 71 cases evaluated, 41 were "ULD-like" and five had SCARB2 mutations. None of 30 "not ULD-like" cases were positive. The five patients with SCARB2 mutations had onset between 14 and 26 years of age, with no evidence of renal failure during 5.5 to 15 years of follow-up; four were followed until death. One living patient had slight proteinuria. A subset of 25 cases were sequenced for PRICKLE1 and no mutations were found. Interpretation: Mutations in SCARB2 are an important cause of hither-to unsolved cases of PME resembling ULD at onset. SCARB2 should be evaluated even in the absence of renal involvement. Onset is in teenage or young adult life. Molecular diagnosis is important for counseling the patient and family, particularly as the prognosis is worse than classical ULD.	[Dibbens, L. M.; Bayly, M.

Naloxone, but Not Flupenthixol, Disrupts the Development of Conditioned Ejaculatory Preference in the Male Rat	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						opioids; dopamine; naloxone; flupenthixol; partner preference	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS DOPAMINE; MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; FEMALE RAT; OPIOID RECEPTORS; PARTNER PREFERENCE; PLACE PREFERENCE; NEUROCHEMICAL BASIS; PACED COPULATION; ESTROUS FEMALE	Male rats display a conditioned preference to ejaculate with a female bearing an odor paired previously with copulation to ejaculation. The present study examined the role of endogenous opioid and dopamine systems in this preference. Male rats received saline, the opioid receptor antagoinst naloxone, or the dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol prior to 10 conditioning trials in a pacing chamber with an almond-scented female. On the final test, all males were injected with saline and given access to 2 females, 1 scented and the other unscented, in an open field. Only males injected with naloxone during training failed to manifest a conditioned ejaculatory preference. These findings suggest that activation of opioid, but not dopamine, systems during sexual interaction are necessary for conditioned ejaculatory preference in male rats.

Photoperiodic Condition Is Associated with Region-Specific Expression of GNRH1 mRNA in the Preoptic Area of the Male Starling (Sturnus vulgaris)	BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION			English	Article						gonadotropin-releasing hormone; neuroendocrinology; seasonal reproduction	GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; PHOTOREFRACTORY EUROPEAN STARLINGS; ZONOTRICHIA-LEUCOPHRYS-GAMBELII; SPARROWS PASSER-DOMESTICUS; WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW; JUNCOS JUNCO-HYEMALIS; JAPANESE-QUAIL; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; GALLUS-DOMESTICUS; MEDIAN-EMINENCE	Many seasonally breeding avian species exhibit marked changes in hypothalamic content of gonadotropin-releasing vhormone 1 (GNRH1) protein that are reflective of breeding condition. We recently cloned the GNRH1 cDNA in European starlings and demonstrated that changes in GNRH1 mRNA levels occur with a time course similar to what has been observed with GNRH1 protein. However, we did not previously resolve whether these differences were attributable to changes in the number of cells expressing the gene. Herein, we investigated photoperiod-induced changes in the number and distribution of GNRH1 mRNA-expressing cells in the preoptic area of male starlings. GNRH1 mRNA-expressing cell number was significantly greater in breeding birds than in nonbreeding birds. Starlings maintained in short nonstimulatory day length (i.e., prebreeding) showed intermediate cell numbers. Detailed analysis of the rostrocaudal and mediolateral distribution revealed that breeding birds had greater numbers of cells expressing GNRH1 mRNA in the medial intermediate, mediocaudal, and lateral intermediate preoptic area compared with prebreeding and nonbreeding birds. These data demonstrate that photoperiodic changes in reproductive state in starlings are associated with region-specific alterations in the number of cells expressing the GNRH1 gene. It remains to be determined whether these changes reflect quantitative differences in gene expression among an otherwise stable population of cells or a phenotypic switch in which cells gain or lose the ability to make GNRH1 mRNA in response to environmental cues.

These nanoparticles can interact with soluble proteins through hydrophobic bonding. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether CHP nanogels would interact with oligomeric forms of the 42 amino acid variant of beta-amyloid (A beta(1-42)) and if the formation of CHP-A beta(1-42) oligomer entities will reduce cytotoxicity of A beta(1-42) in primary cortical cells and microglial (N9) cells. By employing fluorescent CHP analogs with different charges we provide evidence that, (i) both neutral and positively charged CHP nanoparticles interact with A beta(1-42) monomers and oligomers, (ii) neutral CHP is non-toxic, but positively charged derivatives (CHPNH2) are toxic, particularly in primary cortical cultures, and (iii) binding of both monomeric and oligomeric A beta(1-42) to CHP significantly reduces A beta(1-42) toxicity in both the primary cortical and microglial cells. These results suggest that CHP nanogels could provide a valid complementary approach to antibody immunotherapy in neurological disorders characterized by the formation of soluble toxic aggregates, such as those in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Long-term memory (LTM) was tested with a recognition procedure using unfamiliar melodies. Short-term memory (STM) was evaluated with same/different judgment tasks on short series of notes. Musical memory was compared to verbal memory using a task that used pseudowords (LTM) or syllables (STM). Results indicated impaired musical memory in AD patients relative to healthy controls. The deficit was found for both long-term and short-term memory. Furthermore, it was of the same magnitude for both musical and verbal domains whether tested with short-term or long-term memory tasks, No correlation was found between musical and verbal LTM. However, there was a significant correlation between verbal and musical STM in AD participants and healthy older adults, which suggests that the two domains may share common mechanisms.

However, whether this region is crucial for speech perception under normal listening conditions remains debated. To directly test this hypothesis, we applied rTMS to the left ventral premotor cortex and participants performed auditory speech tasks involving the same set of syllables but differing in the use of phonemic segmentation processes. Compared to sham stimulation, rTMS applied over the ventral premotor cortex resulted in slower phoneme discrimination requiring phonemic segmentation. No effect was observed in phoneme identification and syllable discrimination tasks that could be performed without need for phonemic segmentation. The findings demonstrate a mediating role of the ventral premotor cortex in speech segmentation under normal listening conditions and are interpreted in relation to theories assuming a link between perception and action in the human speech processing system.

It can trigger relapse in abstinent addicts, and both in the everyday world and in the laboratory, a stressor can induce drug craving. Drug cues, such as the sight of drug, can also trigger subjective craving and relapse, and this effect may be amplified by stress. Underpinning this interaction may be the fact that stress and reward-predicting drug cues act on overlapping brain regions. We exposed 15 smokers undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging to a psychosocial stressor, the Montreal Imaging Stress Task, followed by drug cues consisting of video clips of smokers. in a separate session similar video clips were shown after a non-stress control task. We observed significantly decreased neural activity during stress in the hippocampus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens. Following stress there was an increased neural response to drug cues in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial thalamus, medial temporal lobe, caudate nucleus, and primary and association visual areas. These regions are thought to be involved in visual attention and in assigning incentive value to cues. Stress-induced limbic deactivation predicted subsequent neural cue-reactivity. We suggest that stress increases the incentive salience of drug cues. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neural correlates of processing stressful information: An event-related fMRI study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Psychosocial stress; fMRI; Event-related design; Deactivation; Limbic system; Prefrontal cortex	PITUITARY-ADRENOCORTICAL AXIS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; WORKING-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; LIMBIC SYSTEM; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTISOL; MECHANISMS	Recent neuroimaging studies investigating neural correlates of psychological stress employ cognitive paradigms that induce a significant hormonal stress response in the scanner. The Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) is one such task that combines challenging mental arithmetic with negative social evaluative feedback. Due to the block design nature of the MIST, it has not been possible thus far to investigate which brain areas respond specifically to the key components of the MIST (mental arithmetic, failure, negative social evaluation). in the current study, we developed an event-related MIST (eventMIST) in order to investigate which neural activation patterns are associated with performing mental arithmetic vs. processing of social evaluative threat. Data was available from twenty healthy university students. The eventMIST induced a significant stress response in a subsample of subjects, called the responders (n=7). Direct comparison between brain activity changes in responders vs. non-responders, in response to challenging math, revealed increased activity bilaterally in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), left temporal pole, and right dorsolateral PFC. In response to negative social evaluation, responders showed reduction of brain activity in limbic system regions (medial orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus), which was largely lacking in non-responders. Direct comparison between the groups for this contrast did not reveal any significant difference, probably due to small number of events available.

However, after 25 years, it has become clear that the earlier distinctions in terms of neuroanatomy and functional dissociation are less pure than originally considered. Dorsal visual areas may exhibit object-selective responses and many 3-D cues of shape, particularly structure-from-motion, appear to be computed exclusively by dorsal areas. These findings imply a more important role for dorsal visual areas in object recognition than previously considered and also place restrictions on the nature of ventral object representations. These representations will need to include information about the objects in 3-D, making them more viewpoint-invariant. They will also need to be invariant to the 3-D cue used to describe them. Through the discussion of relevant findings in psychophysics, single-unit electrophysiology, neuroanatomy and functional imaging, I suggest that these qualities are indeed present in ventral stream representations. Thus dorsal visual areas that extract 3-D structure of shapes from certain cues, can relate these representations to cue-invariant and view-invariant representations in the ventral stream.

BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article							ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT SECRETION; FAMILY-BASED ASSOCIATION; WHITE-MATTER; BIPOLAR DISORDER; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MRI DATA; SEGMENTATION; REGISTRATION; DEPRESSION; VARIANT	A common Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism in the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) gene coding the Val66Met substitution in the pro-BDNF protein has been associated with a number of behavioural and neuroanatomical phenotypes; the latter include, for example, regional differences in volumes of the hippocampus and prefrontal grey matter. Here, we show that the observed regional differences may not stem from a localised effect of this gene. Our analysis of regional brain volume in a cohort of 331 adolescents indicates that the Val66Met substitution has a global effect on brain volume, and that the observed local differences are to be expected if brain allometry-the covariance pattern of regional brain volumes-is taken into account.

Methods: Relevant publications were found primarily by searching the MEDLINE and PubMed databases using the keywords ADHD and the abbreviations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography. The reference lists of the articles found through the databases were then reviewed for the purpose of finding additional articles. Results: There is now substantial evidence of structural and functional alterations in regions outside the frontostriatal circuitry in ADHD, most notably in the cerebellum and the parietal lobes. Conclusions: Although there is compelling evidence suggesting that frontostriatal dysfunction may be central to the pathophysiology of ADHD, the neuroimaging findings point to distributed neural substrates rather than a single one. More research is needed to elucidate the nature of contributions of nonfrontostriatal regions to the pathophysiology of ADHD.

Inverse Mapping the Neuronal Substrates of Face Categorizations	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						face perception; M170; MEG; reverse correlation approach	CLASSIFICATION IMAGES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; VISUAL INFORMATION; CORTICAL RESPONSES; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; HUMAN BRAIN; PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; MEG; LOCALIZATION	Face perception is a complex process involving a network of brain structures, dynamically processing information to enable judgments about a face to be made (e.g., familiarity, identity, and expression). Here we introduce an analysis methodology that makes it possible to directly study this information processing in the brain from spatially and temporally resolved magnetoencephalographic signals. We apply our methodology to the study of 2 face categorization tasks, gender and expressiveness, and track the processing of 3 key visual features that underlie behavioral performance, over time and throughout the cortex. We find information processing correlates beginning from 90 ms following stimulus onset, where features are processed in isolation in occipital extrastriate regions. Over time, processing of successively more features and feature combinations takes place in occipitotemporal regions, with maximal information processing of visual information coinciding with the well-established face-selective M170 component at 170 ms. Later still, around 250-400 ms, cortical activity responds significantly more to task-specific features and their complex combinations. These results indicate a complex process of visual information processing during face perception with face parts processed in isolation at very early stages, and task-specific processing of combinations of features taking place within 300 ms. Crucially, our approach specifically establishes which information in the visual stimulus the brain signal is responding to and how this varies with time, cortical location, and task demands to establish a more precise tracking of information processing mechanisms in the cortex during face perception.

This article aims to distinguish these types of vocal diseases into four different classes for the purpose of automatic screening. Firstly, the reconstructed signal at each wavelet packet decomposition sub-band in five levels of decomposition with mother wavelet of (db10) is used to extract the nonlinear features of self-similarity and approximate entropy. Also, wavelet packet coefficients are used to measure energy and Shannon entropy features at different spectral sub-bands. Consequently, to find a discriminant feature vector, three different methods have been applied: Davies-Bouldin (DB) criteria. genetic algorithm (GA) with the fitness functions of support vector machine's (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor's (KNN) recognition rates. Finally. obtained feature vectors have been passed on to SVM and KNN classifiers. The results show that a feature vector of length 12 obtained by the optimization method of GA with the fitness function of SVM's recognition rate fed to SVM classifier achieves the highest classification accuracy of 91%. Furthermore, nonlinear features play an important role in pathological voice classification by participating rate of approximately 67% in the optimal feature vector.

High occupancy increases the risk of early death or readmission after transfer from intensive care	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						intensive care; readmission; mortality; transfer; vacancy; quality of health care	EFFICACY ASSESSMENT PROJECT; DISCHARGE DECISION-MAKING; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; UNIT READMISSION; MEDICAL ICU; ADMISSION; HOSPITALIZATION; PHYSICIANS; MORTALITY	Objective: To determine whether a lack of intensive care unit beds was leading to premature patient discharge from the intensive care unit and subsequent early readmission or death. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: A single Canadian tertiary care teaching hospital. Patients: All intensive care unit admissions between January 1, 1989 and December 31, 1996 were collected prospectively for inclusion in a registry database. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: There was a positive correlation between early readmission or death and average quarterly intensive care unit percent occupancy (p = .001). During the study period, 8693 patients experienced 10,185 admissions to intensive care. Of the 8222 patients remaining under active treatment (patients under palliative care were excluded), there were 455 (5.5%) adverse events (431 intensive care unit readmissions and 24 deaths) in the first 7 days post intensive care unit discharge. Patients requiring a new surgical intervention with postoperative intensive care unit admission were not considered readmissions. In a multivariate analysis, significant risk factors for an adverse event included age >35 yrs, particular diagnoses (respiratory diagnoses, sepsis, neurosurgery, thoracic surgery, and gastrointestinal diagnoses), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and intensive care unit length of stay. Discharge from the intensive care unit at a time of no vacancy was also a significant risk factor for intensive care unit readmission or unexpected death with an adjusted relative risk of 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.05, 2.31). Conclusions: Increased patient occupancy within an intensive care unit is associated with an increased risk of early death or intensive care unit readmission post intensive care unit discharge. Overloading the capacity of an intensive care unit to care for critically ill patients may affect physician decision-making, resulting in premature discharge from the intensive care unit.

Effect of acute inflammatory brain injury on accumulation of morphine and morphine 3-and 6-glucuronide in the human brain	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						blood-brain barrier; inflammation; morphine; morphine-3-glucuronide; morphine-6-glucuronide; P-glycoprotein; multidrug resistance protein	P-GLYCOPROTEIN EXPRESSION; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; BARRIER TRANSPORT; MEDIATED TRANSPORT; MORPHINE-6-GLUCURONIDE; MORPHINE-3-GLUCURONIDE; PHARMACOKINETICS; MICRODIALYSIS; MICE; RAT	Objective: In animals, central nervous system inflammation increases drug accumulation in the brain partly due to a loss of central nervous system drug efflux transporter function at the blood-brain barrier. To determine whether a similar loss of active drug efflux occurs in humans after acute inflammatory brain injury. Design: Observational human pharmacokinetic study. Setting: Medical-surgical-neurosurgical intensive care unit at a university-affiliated, Canadian tertiary care center. Patients: Patients with acute inflammatory brain injury, including subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 10), intracerebral and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 4), or closed head trauma (n = 2) who received morphine intravenously after being fitted with cerebrospinal fluid ventriculostomy and peripheral arterial catheters. Interventions: We correlated the cerebrospinal fluid distribution of morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide, and morphine-6-glucuronide with the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma concentration of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and the passive marker of blood-brain barrier permeability, albumin. Measurements and Main Results: Acute brain injury produced a robust inflammatory response in the central nervous system as reflected by the elevated concentration of interleukin-6 in cerebrospinal fluid. Penetration of morphine metabolites into the central nervous system increased in proportion to the neuroinflammatory response as demonstrated by the positive correlation between cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-6 exposure and the area under the curve cerebrospinal fluid/plasma ratio for morphine-3-glucuronide (r = .49, p < .001) and morphine-6-glucuronide (r = .51, p < .001). In contrast, distribution of morphine into the brain was not linked with cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-6 exposure (r = .073, p = .54). Albumin concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were consistently in the normal range, indicating that the physical integrity of the blood-brain barrier was likely undisturbed. Conclusions: Our results suggest that central nervous system inflammation following acute brain injury may selectively inhibit the activity of specific drug efflux transporters within the blood-brain barrier. This finding may have significant implications for patients with neuroinflammatory conditions when administered centrally acting drugs normally excluded from the brain by such transporters.

Suppression of Glial HO-1 Activitiy as a Potential Neurotherapeutic Intervention in AD	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article	9th International Conference on Alzheimers Disease Drug Discovery	OCT 06-07, 2008	New York, NY	Alzheimers Drug Discovery Fdn		Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Astrocyte; Heme oxygenase-1; Iron; Metalloporphyrin; Mitochondria; Neuroprotection; OB-24; Oxidative stress	HEME OXYGENASE-1 EXPRESSION; CELLULAR STRESS MODEL; MITOCHONDRIAL IRON SEQUESTRATION; IMIDAZOLE-DIOXOLANE COMPOUNDS; HYPOTHALAMIC ARCUATE NUCLEUS; PERMEABILITY TRANSITION PORE; AMYLOID-PRECURSOR-PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ASTROCYTIC INCLUSIONS	The mechanisms responsible for oxidative damage, pathological brain iron deposition and mitochondrial insufficiency in Alzheimer disease (AD) remain enigmatic. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a 32 kDa stress protein that catabolizes heme to biliverdin, free iron and carbon monoxide. The HO-1 gene is exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress and is induced in brain and other tissues in various models of disease and trauma. Our laboratory demonstrated that 1) HO-1 protein is significantly over-expressed in AD-affected temporal cortex and hippocampus relative to neurohistologically-normal control preparations, 2) in cultured astrocytes, HO-1 up-regulation by transient transfection of the human ho-1 gene, or stimulation of endogenous HO-1 expression by exposure to beta-amyloid, TNF alpha or IL-1 beta, promotes intracellular oxidative stress, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and accumulation of non-transferrin iron in the mitochondrial compartment, and 3) the glial iron sequestration renders co-cultured neuron-like PC12 cells prone to oxidative injury. Induction of the astroglial ho-1 gene may constitute a 'common pathway' leading to pathological brain iron deposition, intracellular oxidative damage and bioenergetic failure in AD and other human CNS disorders. Hypothesis: Targeted suppression of glial HO-1 hyperactivity may prove to be a rational and effective neurotherapeutic intervention in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. To begin testing this hypothesis, studies have been initiated to determine whether systemic administration of a novel, selective and brain-permeable inhibitor of HO-1 activity ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and neuropathology in a transgenic mouse model of AD.

Xenopus Insm1 Is Essential for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Endocrine Cell Development	DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						Xenopus; pancreas; intestine; endocrine; insm1	FINGER TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; NEUROENDOCRINE DIFFERENTIATION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IA-1; EXPRESSION; ENDODERM; LIVER; CONVERSION; PROTEIN; GENES	In mammals, it has been well established that gastrointestinal and pancreatic endocrine cells are specified by a cascade of different transcription factors, but whether these same pathways (or linear relationships) operate in Xenopus is currently unknown. We recently identified the endocrine-specific zinc finger transcription factor insulinoma associated protein 1 (insm1) as a dorsal-enriched gene. We found that insm1 is expressed in the dorsal pancreas as early as NF28, making it one of the earliest markers to be localized to the dorsal pancreas. Through morpholino-mediated knockdown, we demonstrate that insm1 is essential for proper specification of both gastrointestinal and pancreatic endocrine cells. In addition, we place insm1 downstream of ngn3 and upstream of pax6 and neuroD in the endocrine cell transcription factor cascade. These are the first results showing that the endodermal endocrine cell development in Xenopus uses the same transcriptional cascade as in mammals. Developmental Dynamics 238:2505-2510, 2009.

During their first day of development, zebrafish embryos show two simple motor behaviors. First, they coil their trunks spontaneously, and a few hours later they start responding to touch with contralateral coils. These behaviors are contemporaneous until spontaneous coils become infrequent by 30 h. Glutamatergic neurons are distributed throughout the embryonic spinal cord, but their contribution to these early motor behaviors in immature zebrafish is still unclear. We demonstrate that the kinetics of spontaneous coiling and touch-evoked responses show distinct developmental time courses and that the touch response is dependent on AMPA-type glutamate receptor activation. Transection experiments suggest that the circuits required for touch-evoked responses are confined to the spinal cord and that only the most rostral part of the spinal cord is sufficient for triggering the full response. This rostral sensory connection is presumably established via CoPA interneurons, as they project to the rostral spinal cord. Electrophysiological analysis demonstrates that these neurons receive short latency AMPA-type glutamatergic inputs in response to ipsilateral tactile stimuli. We conclude that touch responses in early embryonic zebrafish arise only after glutamatergic synapses connect sensory neurons and interneurons to the contralateral motor network via a rostral loop. This helps define an elementary circuit that is modified by the addition of sensory inputs, resulting in behavioral transformation. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Neurobiological consequences of maternal cannabis on human fetal development and its neuropsychiatric outcome	EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Endocannabinoid; Cannabinoid receptor; Drug addiction; Schizophrenia; THC	PRENATAL MARIJUANA EXPOSURE; ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE; MESSENGER-RNA LEVELS; RAT-BRAIN REGIONS; SELF-ADMINISTRATION BEHAVIOR; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS; MU-OPIOID RECEPTORS; LOW-RISK POPULATION	Despite the high prevalence of marijuana use among pregnant women and adolescents, the impact of cannabis on the developing brain is still not well understood. However, growing evidence supports that the endocannabinoid system plays a major role in CNS patterning in structures relevant for mood, cognition, and reward, such as the mesocorticolimbic system. It is thus clear that exposure to cannabis during early ontogeny is not benign and potential compensatory mechanisms that might be expected to occur during neurodevelopment appear insufficient to eliminate vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders in certain individuals. Both human longitudinal cohort studies and animal models strongly emphasize the long-term influence of prenatal cannabinoid exposure on behavior and mental health. This review provides an overview of the endocannabinoid system and examines the neurobiological consequences of cannabis exposure in pregnancy and early life by addressing its impact on the development of neurotransmitters systems relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and its association with these disorders later in life. It posits that studying in utero cannabis exposure in association with genetic mutations of neural systems that have strong relationships to endocannabinoid function, such as the dopamine, opioid, glutamate, and GABA, might help to identify individuals at risk. Such data could add to existing knowledge to guide public health platform in regard to the use of cannabis and its derivatives during pregnancy.

However, they are not considered on the same level. The Asperger's syndrome belongs to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) since 1994 whereas the Nonverbal Learning Disorder is not part of any official classification to this day. Moreover, the origin of the Nonverbal Learning Disorder is neurological whereas that of Asperger's syndrome remains to be discovered. Some behavioral patterns make it possible to distinguish them, but many similarities exist with children presenting one or the other of the diagnoses. From an examination of the scientific literature, the principal characteristics and disorders associated with both syndromes will be exposed. This article thrives to describe these syndromes and highlight their differences to better diagnose the children presenting one or the other of these conditions.

The economic implications of generic substitution of antiepileptic drugs: a review of recent evidence	EXPERT OPINION ON PHARMACOTHERAPY			English	Review						antiepileptic drugs; bioequivalence; economics; generic substitution; review	EPILEPSY; LAMOTRIGINE; BIOEQUIVALENCE; ISSUES; CARBAMAZEPINE; CONSEQUENCES; PATIENT; IMPACT; COST	Background: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers generic and branded drugs to be therapeutically equivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) disagrees and opposes generic substitution of branded antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) without physician and patient approval due to the risk of loss of seizure control. Objective: To review the evidence to date surrounding the economic impact of brand-to-generic substitutions of AEDs. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted; the bibliographies of key articles obtained from the search were used to identify additional sources. Results/conclusion: Current literature suggests statistically higher overall healthcare costs during periods of generic AED use than during periods when branded AED are used, consistently demonstrated across different countries (Canada and the USA) and in both stable and unstable epilepsy patients, with more pronounced cost increases in patients receiving multiple generic versions. Brand-to-generic substitutions of AEDs do not necessarily reduce overall healthcare costs and may even increase them.

Autonomous parallel parking of a car-like mobile robot by a neuro-fuzzy sensor-based controller	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Car-like mobile robot; Parallel parking; Non-holonomic constraints; Sensor-based fuzzy control; Neuro-fuzzy modeling	SYSTEM	In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy model has been developed for autonomous parallel parking of a car-like mobile robot, In our approach we have focused on the most difficult case of parallel parking which is the case when the parking space dimensions cannot be identified. The proposed model uses the data from three sonar sensors mounted in the front left corner of the car to decide on the turning angle. Fifth-order polynomial reference paths for three different size parking dimensions have been used to generate the training data. The fuzzy model has been identified by subtractive clustering algorithm and trained by ANFIS. The simulation results show that the model can successfully decide about the motion direction at each sampling time without knowing the parking space width, based on the direct sonar readings which serve as inputs. The results which are based oil real dimensions of a typical car demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller in parallel parking. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency enhances resistance against cytomegalovirus infection	GENES AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						MTHFR; folate metabolism; cytomegalovirus; mouse models; innate resistance	QUIESCENT CELLS; T-CELLS; MUTATION; GENE; MICE; HYPERHOMOCYSTEINEMIA; RECOGNITION; EXPRESSION; DISEASE; ENZYME	Folates provide one-carbon units for nucleotide synthesis and methylation reactions. A common polymorphism in the MTHFR gene (677C-T) results in reduced enzymatic activity, and is associated with an increased risk for neural tube defects and cardiovascular disease. The high prevalence of this polymorphism suggests that it may have experienced a selective advantage under environmental pressure, possibly an infectious agent. To test the hypothesis that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype influences the outcome of infectious disease, we examined the response of Mthfr-deficient mice against mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Acute MCMV infection of Mthfr(-/-) mice resulted in early control of cytokine secretion, decreased viral titer and preservation of spleen immune cells, in contrast to Mthfr wild-type littermates. The phenotype was abolished in MTHFR transgenic mice carrying an extra copy of the gene. Infection of primary fibroblasts with MCMV showed a decrease in viral replication and in the number of productively infected cells in Mthfr(+/-) fibroblasts compared with wild-type cells. These results indicate that Mthfr deficiency protects against MCMV infection in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that human genetic variants may provide an advantage in the host response against certain pathogens.

Vaginocervical stimulation induces Fos in glutamate neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus: Attenuation by estrogen and progesterone	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sexual behavior; Genitosensory stimulation; Inhibition; Female rat	FEMALE RAT FOREBRAIN; CONDITIONED PARTNER PREFERENCE; CONSUMMATORY SEXUAL-BEHAVIORS; PACED COITAL STIMULATION; REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR; VAGINAL STIMULATION; ESTRUS TERMINATION; LOCALIZED REGIONS; LORDOSIS BEHAVIOR; BILEVEL CHAMBERS	Vaginocervical stimulation (VCS) induces the immediate-early gene product Fos in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of female rats. However, this induction is lower in ovariectomized rats that receive estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P) relative to an oil vehicle. We have observed that a substantial proportion of cells activated in the VMH by VCS stain for glutamate, and infusions of glutamate or its selective receptor agonists to the VMH inhibit both appetitive and consummatory sexual behaviors in females. This raises the possibility that VCS activates an inhibitory glutamate system in the VMH, and that ovarian steroids blunt the activation, although it is not known whether EB or P, alone or in combination, lead to this effect. The present experiment examined the ability of VCS to induce Fos in glutamate neurons in the VMH of ovariectomized rats under 4 hormonal regimens: oil, EB alone, P alone, or EB+P, following 1 or 50 distributed VCSs administered with a lubricated glass rod over the course of 1 h. Treatment with EB or P alone significantly reduced the number of glutamate neurons activated by 1 VCS, with P being more effective than EB. Treatment with EB+P also produced a significant reduction, but not to the extent of EB or P alone. Although EB and P work in synergy to activate sexual behavior in female rats, actions of EB or P alone are sufficient to blunt the ability of VCS to activate glutamate neurons in the VMH. It thus appears that ovarian steroids may "disinhibit" sexual responding, in part, by dampening the ability of VCS to activate glutamate neurons in the VMH. In turn, this may allow females to receive a sufficient number of intromissions for the activation of sexual reward and the facilitation of pregnancy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Double Dissociation Between Striate and Extrastriate Visual Cortex for Pattern Motion Perception Revealed Using rTMS	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						component motion; pattern motion; plaids; rTMS; V1; V5/MT; fMRI	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; AREA MT; LOW-FREQUENCY; DIRECTION DISCRIMINATION; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; V1; BRAIN; INTEGRATION	The neural mechanisms underlying the integration and segregation of motion signals are often studied using plaid stimuli. These stimuli consist of two spatially coincident dynamic gratings of differing orientations, which are either perceived to move in two unique directions or are integrated by the visual system to elicit the percept of a checkerboard moving in a single direction. Computations pertaining to the motion of the individual component gratings are thought to take place in striate cortex (VI) whereas motion integration is thought to involve neurons in dorsal stream extrastriate visual areas, particularly V5/MT. By combining a psychophysical task that employed plaid stimuli with 1 Hz offline repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), we demonstrated a double dissociation between striate and extrastriate visual cortex in terms of their contributions to Motion integration. rTMS over striate cortex increased coherent motion percepts whereas rTMS over extrastriate cortex had the opposite effect. These effects were robust directly after the Stimulation administration and gradually returned to baseline within 15 minutes. This double dissociation is consistent with previous patient data and the recent hypothesis that both coherent and transparent motion percepts are Supported by the Visual system simultaneously and compete for perceptual dominance.

As shown previously in histological studies, this is likely due to the presence of very large axons. We measured the apparent grey-matter density (aGMd) of the putative CST (pCST) in a large cohort of adolescents (n = 409, aged 1218 years). We tested the following hypotheses: (1) The aGMd in the pCST shows a hemispheric asymmetry that is, in turn, related to hand preference; (2) the maturation of the CST during adolescence differs between both sexes, due to the influence of testosterone; (3) variations in aGMd in the pCST reflect inter-individual differences in manual skills. We confirmed the first two predictions. Thus, we found a strong left > right hemispheric asymmetry in aGMd that was, on average, less marked in the 40 left-handed Subjects. Apparent GMd in the pCST increased with age in adolescent males but not females, and this was particularly related to rising plasma levels of testosterone in male adolescents. This finding is compatible with the idea that testosterone influences axonal calibre rather than myelination. The third prediction, namely, that of a relationship between age-related changes in manual skills and Maturation of the pCST, was not confirmed. We conclude that the leftward asymmetry of the pCST may reflect an early established asymmetry in the number of large corticomotoneuronal fibres in the pCST. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3151-3162, 2009.

Subjects remembered the location and color of either two or four colored disks that were encoded from the left or right visual field (equal number of distractors in the other Visual hemifield). The data were analyzed using time-frequency methods, which enabled LIS to discover a strong oscillatory activity in the 8-15 Hz band during the retention interval. The study of the alpha power variation revealed two types of responses, in different brain regions. The first was a decrease in alpha power in parietal cortex, contralateral to the stimuli, with no load effect. The second was an increase of alpha power in parietal and lateral prefrontal cortex, as memory load increased, but without interaction with the hemifield of the encoded stimuli. The absence of interaction between side of encoded stimuli and memory load suggests that these effects reflect distinct underlying mechanisms. A novel method to localize the neural generators of load-related oscillatory activity was devised, using cortically-constrained distributed source-localization methods. Some activations were found in the inferior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and intraoccipital sulcus (IOS). Importantly, strong oscillatory activity was also found in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Alpha oscillatory activity in DLPFC was synchronized with the activity in parietal regions, suggesting that VSTM functions in the human brain may be implemented via a network that includes bilateral DLPFC and bilateral IOS/IPS as key nodes.

Studying the variability of handwriting patterns using the Kinematic Theory	HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Kinematic Theory; Sigma-Lognormal model; Motor control; Handwriting variability; Complex movements	ARM MOVEMENTS; AIMED MOVEMENTS; NEURAL-NETWORK; MOTOR CONTROL; MODEL; GENERATION; TIME; REPRESENTATION; RECOGNITION; PRIMITIVES	The variability observed in handwriting patterns is analyzed from the perspective of integrating the resulting motor control knowledge in the design of more powerful handwriting recognizers in personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones. Using the highest representational level of the Kinematic Theory of Rapid Human Movement, the Sigma-Lognormal model, this article reports basic theoretical and practical results that could be taken into account in the design of such systems. The main movement variability introduced by the neuromuscular system (NMS) and induced through the scheduling of motor tasks by the central nervous system (CNS) is divided into global and local fluctuations. From a fiducial action plan decoded by this model, a wide range of handwriting distortions are artificially generated by acting on the Sigma-Lognormal parameters. The resulting patterns are studied to understand scale changes and rotational deformations, the two basic features that a recognizer has to take into account. An experiment based on the writing of the same word by six writers is also reported. The results, obtained by an ANOVA analysis, corroborate the predictions and support the relevance of the Kinematic Theory for the analysis and synthesis of handwriting disruptions. These findings consolidate the results of previous studies on single strokes using the Sigma-Lognormal model. Overall, this report provides new insights into our understanding of motor control, as well as into practical cues for the development of huge databases of letters and words to train and test on-line handwriting classifiers and recognizers.

To investigate the residual stereo function of a group of 15 patients with strabismic amblyopia, by using motion-in-depth stimuli that allow discrimination of contributions from local disparity as opposed to those from local velocity mechanisms as a function of the rate of depth change. METHODS. The stereo performance (percentage correct) was measured as a function of the rate of depth change for dynamic random dot stimuli that were either temporally correlated or uncorrelated. RESULTS. Residual stereoscopic function was demonstrated for motion in depth based on local disparity information in 2 of the 15 observers with strabismic amblyopia. The use of a neutral-density (ND) filter in front of the fixing eye enhanced motion-in-depth performance in four subjects randomly selected from the group that originally displayed only chance performance. This finding was true across temporal rate and for correlated and uncorrelated stimuli, suggesting that it was disparity based. The opposite occurred in a group of normal subjects. In a separate experiment, the hypothesis was that the beneficial effect of the ND filter is due to its contrast and/or mean luminance-reducing effects rather than any interocular time delay that it may introduce and that it is specific to motion-in-depth performance, as similar improvements were not found for static stereopsis. CONCLUSIONS. A small proportion of observers with strabismic amblyopia exhibit residual performance for motion in depth, and it is disparity based. Furthermore, some observers with strabismic amblyopia who do not display any significant stereo performance for motion in depth under normal binocular viewing may display above-chance stereo performance if the degree of interocular suppression is reduced. The authors term this phenomenon latent stereopsis.

Rainfall Estimation from Polarimetric S-Band Radar Measurements: Validation of a Neural Network Approach	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							RAINDROP SIZE DISTRIBUTION; DUAL-POLARIZATION RADAR; OKLAHOMA MESONET; HYDROMETEOR CLASSIFICATION; WEATHER RADAR; FUZZY-LOGIC; C-BAND; PRECIPITATION; REFLECTIVITY; ATTENUATION	A procedure for the estimation of rainfall rate, capitalizing on a radar-based raindrop size distribution (RSD) parameter retrieval and neural network (NN) inversion techniques, is validated using an extensive and quality-controlled archive. The RSD retrieval algorithm utilizes polarimetric variables measured by the polarimetric prototype of the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) in Norman, Oklahoma (KOUN), through an ad hoc regularized neural network method. Evaluation of rainfall estimation from the NN-based method is accomplished using a large radar data and surface gauge observation dataset collected in central Oklahoma during the multiyear Joint Polarization Experiment (JPOLE) field campaign. Point estimates of hourly rainfall accumulations and instantaneous rainfall rates from NN-based and parametric polarimetric rainfall relations are compared with dense surface gauge observations. Rainfall accumulations from RSD retrieval-based methods are shown to be sensitive to the choice of a raindrop fall speed model. To minimize the impact of this choice, a new "direct" neural network approach is tested. Proposed NN-based approaches exhibit bias and root-mean-square error characteristics comparable with those obtained from parametric relations, specifically optimized for the JPOLE dataset, indicating an appealing generalization capability with respect to the climatological context. All tested polarimetric relations are shown to be sensitive to hail contamination as inferred from the results of automatic polarimetric echo classification and available storm reports.

First published August 13, 2009; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00564.2009.-Nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells were detected in the peri-infarct/infarct region of the ischemically damaged heart. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the phenotype and potential origin of nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells and identify stimuli implicated in their appearance. In the infarcted human and rat heart, nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells were morphologically and structurally immature, exhibited a desmin-immunoreactive striated phenotype, expressed the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, and associated with an aberrant pattern of connexin-43 expression and/or organization. Nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells were detected 24 h postischemic injury and persisted in the infarcted rat heart for 9 mo. In the normal rat heart, cardiac progenitor transcriptional factors Nkx2.5/GATA4 were detected in a subpopulation of nestin(+) neural stem cells. Following an ischemic insult, nestin(+)/Nkx2.5(+) neural stem cells migrated to the peri-infarct/infarct region and appeared to be in a primordial state of differentiation to a nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cell. The exposure of adult male rats to normobaric hypoxia (12% O-2) for 10 days failed to promote the appearance of nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells. Following osmotic pump delivery of isoproterenol to normal adult rats, nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells were detected, albeit the response was modest and secondary to tissue loss. Thus ischemia-induced appearance of nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cells apparently represents an adaptive response to heal the infarcted heart. Nkx2.5/GATA4 expression in a subpopulation of resident neural stem cells provides the appropriate phenotype for their potential differentiation to a nestin(+) cardiac myocyte-like cell.

The model consisted of five compartments interconnected by systemic circulation. The tissue uptake of RDX was described as a perfusion-limited process whereas hepatic clearance and gastrointestinal absorption were described as first-order processes. The physiological parameters for the rat were obtained from the literature whereas the tissue: blood partition coefficients were estimated on the basis of the tissue and blood composition as well as the lipophilicity characteristics of RDX (logP = 0.87). The tissue: blood partition coefficients (brain, 1.4; muscle, 1; fat, 7.55; liver, 1.2) obtained with this algorithmic approach were used without any adjustment, since a focused in vitro study indicated that the relative concentration of RDX in whole blood and plasma is about 1:1. An initial estimate of metabolic clearance of RDX (2.2 h(-1) kg(-1)) was obtained by fitting PBPK model simulations to the data on plasma kinetics in rats administered 5.5 mg kg(-1) i.v. The rat PBPK model without any further change in parameter values adequately simulated the blood kinetic data for RDX at much lower doses (0.77 and 1.04 mg kg(-1) i.v.), collected in this study. The same model, with the incorporation of a first order oral absorption rate constant (K(a) 0.75 h(-1)), reproduced the blood kinetics of RDX in rats receiving a single gavage dose of 1.53 or 2.02 mg kg(-1). Additionally, the model simulated the plasma and blood kinetics of orally administered RDX at a higher dose (100 mg kg(-1)) or lower doses (0.2 or 1.24 mg kg(-1)) in male rats. Overall, the rat PBPK model for RDX with its parameters adequately simulates the blood and plasma kinetic data, obtained following i.v. doses ranging from 0.77 to 5.5 mg kg(-1) as well as oral doses ranging from 0.2 to 100 mg kg(-1).

Introduction: Vasovagal syncope is common, often recurrent, and reduces quality of life. No therapies have proven useful to improve quality of life in adequately designed randomized clinical trials. Beta-blockers have mixed evidence for effectiveness in preventing syncope. Methods: The Prevention of Syncope Trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational, clinical trial that tested the hypothesis that metoprolol improves quality of life in adult patients with vasovagal syncope in a 1-year observation period. Randomization was stratified in strata of patients <42 and >= 42 years old. The quality of life questionnaires Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Euroqol EQ-5D were completed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of treatment by 204, 132, and 121 patients, respectively. Results: There were 208 patients, mean age 42 +/- 18, of whom 134 (64%) were females. All had positive tilt tests. There was no improvement in quality of life during the trial in the entire group or in either treatment arm. Patients in the metoprolol treatment arm did not have improved quality of life compared to the patients in the placebo arm using either the SF-36 or EQ5D after either 6 or 12 months. Finally, there was no improvement in quality of life associated with metoprolol use in patients either <42 or >= 42 years of age. Conclusion: Metoprolol does not improve quality of life in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope and a positive tilt test.

We report on a phase I/II trial of the XIAP antisense oligonucleotide AEG35156 in combination with reinduction chemotherapy. Patients and Methods Twenty-four patients with rapidly relapsed or refractory AML were treated with escalating doses of AEG35156 (12 to 250 mg/m(2)) as an intravenous solution over 2 hours and 32 patients were treated with the highest planned dose of 350 mg/m(2) in combination with idarubicin and high-dose cytarabine reinduction chemotherapy. Correlative studies were conducted to determine the effects of AEG35156 on levels of XIAP mRNA. Results Knockdown of XIAP mRNA during treatment increased with the dose of the antisense. All patients who received 350 mg/m(2) of AEG35156 had higher than 30% target knockdown with a median maximal knockdown of 90% (range, 48% to 100%). The overall response rate was higher among the patients receiving the highest dose of AEG35156. In this group, 15 (47%) of 32 patients achieved complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp) compared with only one (4%) of 24 receiving 12 to 250 mg/m(2) AEG35156. Among the patients receiving 350 mg/m(2) of AEG35156 in combination with chemotherapy, 10 (91%) of 11 who were refractory to a single induction chemotherapy regimen achieved CR/CRp after reinduction with AEG35156 and chemotherapy. AEG35156 was well tolerated save for two cases of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving multiple doses of AEG35156. Conclusion At the highest dose tested, AEG35156 knocks down its target and appears very effective when combined with chemotherapy in patients with AML refractory to a single induction regimen.

Despite WBRT, the tumor bed remains a common site of failure. We reviewed outcomes following adjuvant WBRT with tumor bed radiosurgery (SRS). We retrospectively identified patients having undergone neurosurgical resection of a single brain metastasis followed by adjuvant WBRT and tumor bed SRS. SRS dose selection was independent of target volume (10 Gy peripheral dose). Outcomes were calculated actuarially. Patients were censured for local control at the time of last imaging. From 2005 to 2008, 27 patients were treated with WBRT and tumor bed SRS. Median age was 58.7 years, median KPS 80%. The primary malignancy was non-small cell lung cancer in 70%. Median follow-up was 9.7 months. Following the combination of surgery, WBRT and SRS the median overall survival was 17.6 months. Actuarial 2-year local control was 94%. The SRS boost was well tolerated with one patient (4%) requiring reoperation for symptomatic radiation necrosis 16 months post treatment. Radiosurgery can be safely added to WBRT as an adjuvant treatment following resection of a single brain metastasis. In our retrospective series, this combination treatment produced a high rate of local control.

Neuropathologic consequences of TD include region-selective neuronal cell loss and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. Early increased expression of the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) occurs selectively in vulnerable brain regions in TD. We hypothesize that region-selective eNOS induction in TD leads to altered expression of tight junction proteins and BBB breakdown. In order to address this issue, TD was induced in C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and eNOS-/- mice by feeding a thiamine-deficient diet and treatment with the thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine. Pair-fed control mice were fed the same diet with additional thiamine. In medial thalamus of TD-WT mice (vulnerable area), increased heme oxygenase-1 and S-nitrosocysteine immunostaining was observed in vessel walls, compared to pair-fed control-WT mice. Concomitant increases in IgG extravasation, decreases in expression of the tight junction proteins occludin, zona occludens-1 and zona occludens-2, and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in endothelial cells were observed in the medial thalamus of TD-WT mice. eNOS gene deletion restored these BBB alterations, suggesting that eNOS-derived nitric oxide is a major factor leading to cerebrovascular alterations in TD. However, eNOS gene deletion only partially attenuated TD-related neuronal cell loss, suggesting the presence of mechanisms additional to BBB disruption in the pathogenesis of these changes.

SK channels gate information processing in vivo by regulating an intrinsic bursting mechanism seen in vitro. J Neurophysiol 102: 2273-2287, 2009. First published August 12, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.00282.2009. Understanding the mechanistic substrates of neural computations that lead to behavior remains a fundamental problem in neuroscience. In particular, the contributions of intrinsic neural properties such as burst firing and dendritic morphology to the processing of behaviorally relevant sensory input have received much interest recently. Pyramidal cells within the electrosensory lateral line lobe of weakly electric fish display an intrinsic bursting mechanism that relies on somato-dendritic interactions when recorded in vitro: backpropagating somatic action potentials trigger dendritic action potentials that lead to a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP) at the soma. We recorded intracellularly from these neurons in vivo and found firing patterns that were quite different from those seen in vitro: we found no evidence for DAPs as each somatic action potential was followed by a pronounced afterhyperpolarization (AHP). Calcium chelators injected in vivo reduced the AHP, thereby unmasking the DAP and inducing in vitro-like bursting in pyramidal cells. These bursting dynamics significantly reduced the cell's ability to encode the detailed time course of sensory input. We performed additional in vivo pharmacological manipulations and mathematical modeling to show that calcium influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors activate dendritic small conductance (SK) calcium-activated potassium channels, which causes an AHP that counteracts the DAP and leads to early termination of the burst. Our results show that ion channels located in dendrites can have a profound influence on the processing of sensory input by neurons in vivo through the modulation of an intrinsic bursting mechanism.

However, their application in brain delivery is relatively a new area of research. The present study was aimed at evaluating the uptake and permeation of polyether-copolyester (PEPE) dendrimers across the blood-brain barrier model and exploring the underlying mechanisms. Saturation was observed in the uptake of rhodamine B labeled PEPE dendrimers by brain vascular endothelial (bEnd.3) cells at high concentrations. Clathrin and caveolin inhibitors produced partial inhibition of the dendrimer uptake, signifying contribution of both pathways in the uptake process. PEPE dendrimers were able to cross in vitro BBB model in high amounts with P(app) of 19.7 +/- 1.9 x 10(-6) cm/s and 38.6 +/- 4.1 x 10(-6) cm/s for den-1-(G2)-400 and den-2-(G2)-400, respectively; and only 11-14% reduction in transendothelial electrical resistance during initial 4 h. The results of this study suggest that architecture of dendrimers plays a major role not only in influencing the extent and mechanism of uptake by bEnd.3 cells but also permeation across the BBB model.

Recent studies showed a cardioprotective role of oxytocin (OT) to induce natriuretic peptides (NPs) and nitric oxide (NO) release. It is not known if the diabetic state is associated with a reduced OT-NPs-NO system and if exercise training improves this system. To address this, we investigated the effects of treadmill running using the db/db mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Eight-week-old db/db mice were subjected to running 5 days per week for a period of 8 weeks. The lean db/+ littermates were used as controls. Sedentary db/db mice were obese and hyperglycaemic, and exercise training was not effective in reducing body weight and the hyperglycaemic state. Compared to control mice, db/db mice had lower heart weight and heart-to-body weight ratios. In these mice, this was associated with augmented cardiac apoptosis, cardiomyocyte enlargement and collagen deposits. In addition, db/db mice displayed significant downregulation in gene expression of OT (76%), OT receptors (65%), atrial NP (ANP; 43%), brain NP (BNP; 87%) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (54%) in the heart (P < 0.05). Exercise training had no effect on expression of these genes which were stimulated in control mice. In response to exercise training, the significant increment of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene expression was observed only in control mice (P < 0.05). In conclusion, downregulation of the OT-NPs-NO system occurs in the heart of the young db/db mouse. Exercise training was not effective in reversing the defect, suggesting impairment of this cardiac protective system in diabetes.

This is the second case report of a woman with bipolar disorder type I who noted the onset of persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) symptoms after abrupt cessation of paroxetine. With the worsening of PGAD symptoms, she developed severe depression and suicidal thoughts, resulting in her undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as management. Aim. To describe a case of PGAD and develop hypotheses to explain the beneficial actions of ECT on PGAD based on 4 years of ECT administration. Methods. Patient self-report after obtaining consent, as well as literature review. Results. After the fourth ECT, the patient's PGAD symptoms abated serendipitously. She was placed on ECT on demand for the treatment of her PGAD. With each ECT treatment, PGAD symptoms immediately disappeared, relapsing slowly over time until the next ECT was administered. The patient has, thus far, received a total of 30 treatments of ECT. Side effects continue to be minimal and include brief short-term memory loss, headache, and muscle aches. Conclusion. ECT is known to induce cerebral excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter changes after acute and chronic administration. Sexual arousal is stimulated by the action of hypothalamic and limbic dopamine, noradrenaline, melanocortin, and oxytocin, and inhibited by serotonin, cerebral opioids, and endocannabinoids. Based on the patient's bipolar disorder, the mechanism of action of ECT and the observation of ECT effectiveness on her PGAD, we hypothesize the following: (i) bipolar disorder led to central hyperactive dopamine release, an important component in the pathophysiology of her PGAD; (ii) central serotonin deficiency after selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) withdrawal resulted in a lack of inhibition of sexual excitement; (iii) ECT resulted in lowering of the hyperstimulated central dopamine release; and (iv) ECT led to an increase in sexual inhibition by stimulating serotonin activity. Further research in the central control of sexual arousal is needed. Korda JB, Pfaus JG, Kellner CH, and Goldstein I.

Isolated positional vertigo or dizziness can be the initial presentation symptom. The objective is to compare the presence of isolated positional vertigo or dizziness in patients with evaluation of VA morphology, thrombotic stroke risk factors, and evolution of symptoms with time. Study Design: Double-blind retrospective cohort study. Methods: Magnetic resonance angiography reports describing the VAs of 258 patients were reviewed, and 133 were questioned and their hospital charts reviewed for positional vertigo or dizziness. Neurotologic examination was performed on 75 patients. Vestibular testing using electronystagmography was performed on 46 patients. The prevalence of thrombotic stroke factors was evaluated in all patients. Groups were compared using chi-square statistical analysis. Results: A total of 72 patients with normal VAs (group A) were compared with a group of 61 patients with stenotic or hypoplastic VAs (group 13). When stratifying patients for stroke risk factors, 85.7% of group B patients complaining of isolated positional vertigo on the questionnaire with at least three stroke risk factors had a vertebral artery abnormality (P = .026). A hypothesized mechanism is transient ischemic attack of the semicircular canals or vestibular nucleus during rotation and extension of the neck, which compresses a contralateral stenotic VA in patients with bilateral VA abnormalities. Conclusions: In patients complaining of isolated positional vertigo or dizziness of unexplained etiology and having at least three thrombotic stroke risk factors, we recommend a vertebrobasilar radio-logical evaluation for timely treatment accordingly to the results.

Since the brain tissue microenvironmental niche is a prerequisite for expression of the stem cell marker CD133 antigen in brain tumors, we investigated the invasion mechanisms specific to CD133(+) U87 glioblastoma cells in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), two circulating bioactive lysophospholipids and potent inducers of cancer. A CD133(+) U87 glioma cell population was isolated from parental U87 glioblastoma cells using magnetic cell sorting technology. The CD133(+)-enriched cell population grew as neurospheres and showed enhanced maximal response to both LPA (similar to 5.0-fold) and S1P (similar to 2.5-fold) at 1 mu M when compared to parental U87 cells. The increased response to LPA in CD133(+) cells, reflected by increased levels of phosphorylated ERK, was found independent of the cooperative functions of the membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), while this cooperativity was essential to the SIP response. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed and we found higher gene expression levels of the SIP receptors S1P1 and S1P2, and of the LPA receptor LPA1 in CD133(+) cells than in their parental U87 cells. These increased levels reflected those observed from in vivo experimental U87 tumor implants. Our data suggest that the CD133(+) cell subpopulation evokes most of the lysophospholipid response within brain tumors through a combined regulation of S1P/LPA cell surface receptors signaling and by MT1-MMP. The emergence of lead compounds targeting the stem cell niche and S1P/LPA signaling in CD133(+) cancer cells is warranted. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Nearly 400 GPCRs (i.e., excluding odorant and light receptors) are encoded within the human genome, but only a small fraction of these seven-transmembrane proteins have been identified as drug targets. Chronic pain affects more than one-third of the population, representing a substantial societal burden in use of health care resources and lost productivity. Furthermore, currently available treatments are often inadequate, underscoring the significant need for better therapeutic strategies. The expansion of the identified human GPCR repertoire, coupled with recent insights into the function and structure of GPCRs, offers new opportunities for the development of novel analgesic therapeutics.

Materials & methods: The extent of colocalization between the nanoparticles and organelles was assessed by confocal microscopy, spectrofluorometry and cell sorting. Results: Cell treatment with a common fatty acid (oleic acid) within the range of physiological concentrations markedly enhanced the InGaP/ZnS uptake by microglia and afforded their colocalization within lipid droplets/lysosomes but not with mitochondria. Conclusion: These results suggest that the availability of mono-unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, in different cells could significantly alter nanoparticle uptake and localization, which can in turn affect the functions of cells and tissues coexposed to nanoparticles.

In this study we used magnetic resonance images to describe the patterns of cortical thinning in 11 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 38 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 34 healthy elderly (H(E)) subjects. AD and FTD displayed significant thinning of the cortical mantle compared to the H(E) group, but with distinctive distributions. AD subjects had significantly thinner cortex in all lobes whereas FTD compared to H(E) showed significant differences only in specific regions of frontal and temporal lobes. When compared to AD, the FTD subjects had a trend of thinner cortex in the anterior cingulate region and in selective regions of anterior frontal and temporal regions. In conclusion, the cortical thinning in dementia when compared to H(E), is disease specific whereby FTD subjects display a pattern distinct than that seen in Alzheimer's disease.

Neurol. 59:282-288, 2006). In the present study, we measured for the first time mRNA levels of Nur77, an orphan nuclear receptor that participates to adaptive and/or aberrant dopamine-related behaviors, and retinoid X receptor gamma 1 (RXR gamma 1), a putative brain receptor for DHA and transcriptional partner of Nur77, in MPTP monkeys treated with L-Dopa and DHA. The RXR gamma 1 mRNA is strongly expressed in monkey caudate nucleus and putamen, but no change in levels of RXR gamma 1 was observed following MPTP and L-Dopa treatments. On the other hand, denervation reduced Nur77 mRNA levels, whereas chronic L-Dopa treatment strongly induced Nur77 transcripts. These modulations are taking place in substance P positive cells and are associated with both caudate-putamen matrix and striosome compartments. Interestingly, combination of L-Dopa with DHA further increases Nur77 mRNA levels in the anterior caudate-putamen, and mainly in striosomes. This is accompanied by a significant inverse correlation between Nur77 mRNA levels and dyskinetic scores. Taken together, our results show that Nur77 expression is modulated following dopamine denervation and chronic L-Dopa therapy in a non-human primate model of Parkinson's disease, and suggest that strong modulation of Nur77 expression might be linked to a reduced risk to develop LIDs.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of group I mGluR selective ligands, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ((S)-3,5-DHPG) and (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA), in lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50 ng/ml)-activated rat microglial cultures. (S)-3,5-DHPG (150 mu M) significantly reduced (approximately 20-60%) the LPS-mediated production of nitrite (NO(2) (-)), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and l-glutamate (Glu) at 24 and 72 h. Image analysis revealed increases in both cell area and number, with larger amoeboid microglia (with retracted processes) formed following 2 h LPS exposure. This cellular population was absent after addition of (S)-3,5-DHPG, an effect antagonised by AIDA, and a concomitant reduction in cell area was also found. Taken together, these biochemical and morphological observations suggest that (S)-3,5-DHPG reduces microglial activation, indicating a role for group I mGluRs in modulating microglial function.

Altered expression of tight junction proteins and matrix metalloproteinases in thiamine-deficient mouse brain	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Thiamine deficiency; Blood-brain barrier; Tight junction proteins; Matrix metalloproteinase-9; Wernicke's encephalopathy	OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; NEURONAL LOSS; CDNA CLONING; BARRIER; OCCLUDIN; RAT; INFLAMMATION; DISRUPTION; MODEL	Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) in humans is a metabolic disorder caused by thiamine deficiency (TD). In both humans and experimental animals, TD leads to selective neuronal cell death in diencephalic and brainstem structures. Neuropathologic features of WE include petechial hemorrhagic lesions, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of TD. The goal of the present study was to examine expression of the tight junction (TJ) protein occludin. its associated scaffolding proteins zona occludens (ZO-1 and ZO-2), and to measure matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels as a function of regional BBB permeability changes in thiamine-deficient mice. TD was induced in 12-week-old male C57B1/6 mice by feeding a thiamine-deficient diet and administration of the central thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine. BBB permeability was measured by IgG extravasation: expression of occludin, ZO-1 and ZO-2 was measured by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, structural integrity of the BBB was assessed using occludin and ZO-1 immunostaining, and MMPs levels were measured by gelatin zymography and immunohistochemistry. Studies were performed in vulnerable (medial thalamus) versus spared (frontal cortex) regions of the brain. Hemorrhagic lesions, selective increases in brain IgG extravasation, a concomitant loss in protein expression of occludin, ZO-1 and ZO-2, as well as decreased and disrupted patterns of occludin and ZO-1 immunostaining were observed in the medial thalamus of thiamine-deficient mice. MMP-9 levels were also selectively increased in the medial thalamus of these animals, and were found to be localized in the vascular endothelium, as well as in cells with an apparent polymorphonuclear morphology. No changes of TJ gene expression were observed. These results indicate that alterations in TJ proteins occur in TD, and offer a plausible explanation for the selective increase in BBB permeability in thiamine-deficient animals. They also suggest a role for MMP-9 in the initiation of changes to BBB integrity in TD. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Low-Dose and High-Dose Synacthen Tests and the Hemodynamic Response to Hydrocortisone in Acute Traumatic Brain Injury	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Tetracosactide; Synacthen; Low-dose; Adrenal insufficiency	PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; SEPTIC SHOCK; STIMULATION TESTS; INSUFFICIENCY; DISEASE	In order to identify whether low-dose (1 mu g) tetracosactide (Synacthen(A (R))) testing may be preferable to high-dose (250 mu g) testing in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in traumatic brain injury (TBI), as suggested by studies in other forms of critical illness. We retrospectively reviewed the results of modified tetracosactide tests (involving administration of both low-dose and high-dose tetracosactide) conducted for clinical indications in patients in a neurocritical care unit within 10 days of TBI. Sixty-three modified tests were included and cortisol concentrations before and after administration of tetracosactide were extracted from the hospital records. Data were also extracted regarding hemodynamic response to empirical corticosteroid therapy, based on rapid weaning from vasoactive drugs. Cortisol increments at 30 and 60 min following tetracosactide correlated well in the low-dose test (r (2) = 0.875, P < 0.0001). The mean cortisol concentration was 581 nmol/l at 30 min and 556 nmol/l at 60 min in the low-dose test. Cortisol increments following low-dose and high-dose testing correlated well overall (r (2) = 0.839, P < 0.0001), but results were discordant in 27 of 63 cases (43%) when the same diagnostic threshold was used. ROC curve analysis showed that both tests performed poorly in identifying hemodynamic steroid responsiveness (AUC 0.553 and 0.502, respectively). In the low-dose tetracosactide test, it is sufficient to determine cortisol concentrations at baseline and at 30 min. Low-dose and high-dose tests give discordant results in a significant proportion of cases when using the same diagnostic threshold. Neither test can be used to guide the initiation of corticosteroid therapy in acute TBI.	[Wijesurendra, R. S.; Bernard, F.; Outtrim, J.; Maiya, B.; Menon, D.

Subjects: A reference group composed of 75 patients with clinically probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 75 age-matched controls: and a study group composed of 49 MCI, 20 having progressed to clinically probable AD and 29 having remained stable after a 48 month follow-up. Methods: We created a pathology-specific reference space using principal component analysis of MRI-based features (intensity, local volume changes) within the medial temporal lobe of T1-weighted baseline images for the reference group. We projected similar data from the study group and identified a restricted set of image features highly correlated with one-year change in MMSE, using a bootstrap sampling estimation. We used robust linear regression models to predict one-year MMSE changes from baseline MRI, baseline MMSE, age, gender, and years of education. Results: All experiments were performed using a leave-one-out paradigm. We found multiple image-based features highly correlated with one-year MMSE changes (vertical bar r vertical bar > 0.425). The model for all N=49 MCI subjects had a correlation of r=0.31 between actual and predicted one-year MMSE change values. A second model only for MCI subjects with MMSE loss larger than 1 U had a pairwise correlation r=0.80 with an adjusted coefficient of determination r(2)=0.61. Findings: Our automated MRI-based technique revealed a strong relationship between baseline MRI features and one-year cognitive changes in a sub-group Of MCI Subjects. This technique should be generalized to other aspects of cognitive evaluation and to a wider scope of dementias. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This approach uses spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients to model the shape of the hippocampi, which are segmented from magnetic resonance images (MRI) using a fully automatic method that we previously developed. SPHARM coefficients are used as features in a classification procedure based on support vector machines (SVM). The most relevant features for classification are selected using a bagging strategy. We evaluate the accuracy of our method in a group of 23 patients with AD (10 males, 13 females, age standard-deviation (SD) = 73 +/- 6 years, mini-mental score (MMS) = 24.4 +/- 2.8). 23 patients with amnestic MCI (10 males, 13 females, age SD = 74 +/- 8 years, MMS = 27.3 +/- 1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13 males, 12 females, age SD = 64 8 years), using leave-one-out cross-validation. For AD vs controls, we obtain a correct classification rate of 94%, a sensitivity of 96%, and a specificity of 92%. For MCI vs controls, we obtain a classification rate of 83%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 84%. This accuracy is superior to that of hippocampal volumetry and is comparable to recently published SVM-based whole-brain classification methods, which relied on a different strategy. This new method may become a useful tool to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With the aim of designing an algorithm-based frame realignment method, we first conducted investigations that aimed at optimizing the parameters of a coregistration method, such as the choice of the target volume and the similarity criterion. Based on these results we designed a novel frame realignment strategy in a multi-step algorithm using uncorrected reconstructed images, cross-correlation similarity criteria for the determination of inter-frame motion parameters and emission-transmission mismatch for each frame. Features and validation results are reported here based on a multi-subject simulated [(11)C]raclopride dynamic PET scan database incorporating intra-frame movements of various magnitudes and with various times of occurrence. Performances of the proposed algorithm were evaluated at regional and voxel-based level for binding potential parametric images. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cerebellar Cleft: Confirmation of the Neuroimaging Pattern	NEUROPEDIATRICS			English	Article						cerebellar cleft; cerebellar hemorrhage; cerebellar disruption	CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; GENETIC CLASSIFICATION; PRETERM INFANTS; RISK-FACTORS; MR; MALFORMATIONS; BRAIN; ABNORMALITIES	We recently described the neuroimaging and clinical findings in 6 children with cerebellar clefts and proposed that they result from disruptive changes following prenatal cerebellar hemorrhage. We now report an additional series of 9 patients analyzing the clinical and neuroimaging findings. The clefts were located in the left cerebellar hemisphere in 5 cases, in the right in 3, and bilaterally in one child who had bilateral cerebellar hemorrhages as a preterm infant at 30 weeks gestation. In one patient born at 24 weeks of gestation a unilateral cerebellar hemorrhage has been found at the age of 4 months. Other findings included disordered alignment of the folia and fissures, an irregular gray/white matter junction, and abnormal arborization of the white matter in all cases. Supratentorial abnormalities were found in 4 cases. All but 2 patients were born at term. We confirm the distinct neuroimaging pattern of cerebellar clefts. Considering the documented fetal cerebellar hemorrhage in our first series, we postulate that cerebellar clefts usually represent residual disruptive changes after a prenatal cerebellar hemorrhage. Exceptionally, as now documented in 2 patients, cerebellar clefts can be found after neonatal cerebellar hemorrhages in preterm infants. The short-term outcome in these children was variable.

F-18-Labeled flumazenil ([F-18]FZ) provides a potentially useful tracer to investigate those disorders by means of positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: [18F]Flumazenil was synthesized from its nitro-precursor Ro 15-2344 in DMF at high temperatures between 150 degrees C and 160 degrees C. Other solvents like acetonitrile and dimethylsulfoxide were also investigated as reaction media. A new HPLC method for the final Purification of [F-18]FZ was developed to circumvent some difficulties associated with a previously published procedure sometimes led to a contamination of [F-18]FZ with Ro 15-2344. The final purification of the radiotracer was achieved using a Waters Symmetry Prep C18 HPLC column with elution with 0.05 M sodium acetate (NaOAc) buffer (pH 5)/THF/MeOH (80: 10: 10). Results: [F-18]FZ could be synthesized in reproducible radiochemical yields (RCYs) of 15-20% (decay corrected to EOB) after 80 min overall synthesis time. The synthesized [F-18]FZ was applied for the first time in a human PET study in a patient with ischemic right middle cerebral artery stroke using the HRRT high-resolution research scanner (Siemens Medical Solution, Knoxville, TN, USA). Conclusions: [F-18]FZ is a potentially useful GABA receptor-binding PET ligand. A modified procedure for its preparation in reproducibly high radiochemical yields has been described and the [F-18]FZ thus produced has been used successfully in a pilot clinical study.

We designed and tested a mini-library of small molecules peptidomimetics based on beta-turns of the neurotrophin growth factor polypeptides NT-3, which is the natural ligand for TrkC receptors. Biological studies identified a peptidomimetic 2Cl that exhibited selective antagonism of TrkC. 2Cl reduces TrkC activation and signaling promoted by NT-3, and selectively blocks ligand-dependent cell survival. 2Cl also blocks ligand-independent TrkC activation and signals that take place when the receptor is over-expressed. This work adds to our understanding of how the neurotrophins function through Trk receptors, and demonstrates that peptidomimetics can be designed to selectively disturb neurotrophin-receptor interactions, and receptor activation.

This website, with open and free access, is built from free software with Web 2.0 technology. It is hosted at the University of Limoges. It functions as a digital library, containing scanned books, slide shows, more than 200 hours of recorded courses and round tables accessible by streaming video. The site is indexed according to the users' needs, by level of knowledge, specialty, keywords, and supplementary MeSH terms. The campus is organized as the College of Neurosurgery (http.//college.neurochirurgie.fr). The durability of this type of training (in existence for 9 years now) is made possible by a powerful and committed consortium: the French Society of Neurosurgery, which has created high-quality intellectual and scientific resources, the University of Limoges, the Dupoytren University Hospital Center in Limoges, the region of Limousin, and the French-language virtual Medical University, which hove provided logistic and financial support. To target appropriate levels at various users, we distinguished four groups: medical students, neurosurgery students, neurosurgeons (continuing medical education), and students in allied health fields. All areas of neurosurgery ore concerned. All the courses, including tests for self-evaluation and scientific meetings (organized with information and communication technologies) ore digitally recorded for the site. The principles that make it possible for a medical discipline to organize around an online project are: a pedagogical conception of projects built in the form of models reusable by other health specialties; a stronghold within professional societies of the relevant specialties able to create high-quality intellectual and scientific resources; on organization by educational levels that con be extended transversally to other health disciplines; and free access to the digital campus, the durability of which depends on the dissemination and dynamism of its consortium.

The number and location of these oculomotor control zones remain controversial, especially in the human brain. In the monkey, the frontal eye field (FEF) is located in the rostral bank of the arcuate sulcus at approximately the level of the posterior end of the sulcus principalis, the supplementary eye field (SEF) is located on the dorsomedial frontal cortex, and the cingulate eye field (CEF) in the dorsal bank of the cingulate sulcus. In the human frontal cortex, the location of the FEF varies depending on the method used, electrical stimulation or functional neuroimaging, to establish it. Some investigators have argued that the SEF is located on the media] wall of the frontal lobe but its presumed location remains controversial. The location of the CEF in the human brain is not known. The present article reviews electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging evidence regarding the location of these frontal oculomotor areas in the macaque monkey and human brains and, in light of new findings in the human brain, attempts to reconcile the differences observed in the location of these eye fields using the different techniques. Together, these data suggest the existence of at least four eye fields in the frontal cortex, i.e. the FEF, the SEF, the CEF, and a premotor eye field, and suggest that their anatomical relationships are preserved from monkey to human brain.

This Study compares the effects of caffeine on daytime recovery sleep in young (20-30 y.) and middle-aged subjects (45-60 y.). Methods: Subjects participated in both caffeine (200 mg) and placebo conditions (double-blind crossover design), spaced one month apart. For each condition, subjects initially came to the laboratory for a nocturnal sleep episode. Daytime recovery sleep started in the morning after 25 h of wakefulness. Subjects were administered either one caffeine (100 mg) or placebo capsule three hours before daytime recovery sleep and the remaining dose one hour before daytime recovery sleep. Results: Middle-aged Subjects showed greater decrements of sleep duration and sleep efficiency than young subjects during daytime recovery under placebo compared to nocturnal sleep. Caffeine decreased sleep efficiency, sleep duration, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep during daytime recovery sleep similarly in both age groups. Caffeine also reduced N-REM sleep EEG synchronization during daytime recovery sleep (reduced delta, theta, and alpha power, and greater beta power). Conclusions: The combined influence of age and caffeine made the sleep of middle-aged subjects particularly vulnerable to the circadian waking signal. We propose that lower brain synchronization due to age and caffeine produces greater difficulty in overriding the circadian waking signal during daytime sleep and leads to fragmented sleep. These results have implications for the high proportion of the population using caffeine to cope with night work and jet lag, particularly the middle-aged. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tools and Technologies for Computer-Aided Speech and Language Therapy	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Spoken language learning; Speech disorders; Speech corpora; Automatic speech recognition; Pronunciation verification	RECOGNITION	This paper addresses the problem of Computer-Aided Speech and Language Therapy (CASLT). The goal of the work described in the paper is to develop and evaluate a semi-automated system for providing interactive speech therapy to the increasing population of impaired individuals and help professional speech therapists. A discussion on the development and evaluation of a set of interactive therapy tools, along with the underlying speech technologies that support these tools is provided. The interactive tools are designed to facilitate the acquisition of language skills in the areas of basic phonatory skills, phonetic articulation and language understanding primarily for children with neuromuscular disorders like dysarthria. Human-machine interaction for all of these areas requires the existence of speech analysis, speech recognition, and speech verification algorithms that are robust with respect to the sources of speech variability that are characteristic of this population of speakers. The paper will present an experimental study that demonstrates the effectiveness of an interactive system for eliciting speech from a population of impaired children and young speakers ranging in age from 11 to 21 years. The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and subword-based pronunciation verification (PV) on this domain are also presented. The results indicate that ASR and PV systems configured from speech utterances taken from the impaired speech domain can provide adequate performance, similar to the experts' agreement rate, for supporting the presented CASLT applications.

Organ Donation: A Portrait of Family Refusal in Quebec	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th Annual Congress of the French-Speaking-Society-of-Transplantation	OCT, 2008	Quebec City, CANADA				TRANSPLANTATION	Many studies from around the world have reported different reasons why families refuse organ donation. In Quebec, however, there are no known data on the subject. To enable us to better communicate with families, a research project was conducted from January to December 2007 in hospital centers with personnel who specialize in supporting families. Our objective was to identify the reasons why Quebecers refuse a request for organ donation. The findings demonstrate that knowing the express wishes of the deceased person about organ donation and end-of-life treatment influences the family, When these wishes are not known, the partners of older donors refuse in greater numbers, primarily for familial or circumstantial reasons. Refusal based on religion or ethnicity is rare. Some families approached before neurologic death is diagnosed do not wish to wait until all the criteria for neurologic death are met.

Light not only guides performance on these tasks through vision but also exerts non-visual effects that are mediated in part by recently discovered retinal ganglion cells maximally sensitive to blue light. We review recent neuroimaging studies which demonstrate that the wavelength, duration and intensity of light exposure modulate brain responses to (non-visual) cognitive tasks. These responses to light are initially observed in alertness-related subcortical structures (hypothalamus, brainstem, thalamus) and limbic areas (amygdala and hippocampus), followed by modulations of activity in cortical areas, which can ultimately affect behaviour. Light emerges as an important modulator of brain function and cognition.

Although facial expressions are widely considered to be the universal language of emotion [1-3], some negative facial expressions consistently elicit lower recognition levels among Eastern compared to Western groups (see [4] for a meta-analysis and [5, 6] for review). Here, focusing on the decoding of facial expression signals, we merge behavioral and computational analyses with novel spatiotemporal analyses of eye movements, showing that Eastern observers use a culture-specific decoding strategy that is inadequate to reliably distinguish universal facial expressions of "fear" and "disgust." Rather than distributing their fixations evenly across the face as Westerners do, Eastern observers persistently fixate the eye region. Using a model information sampler, we demonstrate that by persistently fixating the eyes, Eastern observers sample ambiguous information, thus causing significant confusion. Our results question the universality of human facial expressions of emotion, highlighting their true complexity, with critical consequences for cross-cultural communication and globalization.

Regulation of peripheral blood flow in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: clinical implication for symptomatic relief and pain management	BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS			English	Review							REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY; SYNDROME-TYPE-I; CHRONIC POSTISCHEMIA PAIN; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; IMPAIRED SELF-PERCEPTION; CORONARY-ARTERY DISEASE; LASER-DOPPLER FLOWMETRY; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NITRIC-OXIDE; SYNDROME TYPE-1	Background: During the chronic stage of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS), impaired microcirculation is related to increased vasoconstriction, tissue hypoxia, and metabolic tissue acidosis in the affected limb. Several mechanisms may be responsible for the ischemia and pain in chronic cold CPRS. Discussion: The diminished blood flow may be caused by either sympathetic dysfunction, hypersensitivity to circulating catecholamines, or endothelial dysfunction. The pain may be of neuropathic, inflammatory, nociceptive, or functional nature, or of mixed origin. Summary: The origin of the pain should be the basis of the symptomatic therapy. Since the difference in temperature between both hands fluctuates over time in cold CRPS, when in doubt, the clinician should prioritize the patient's report of a persistent cold extremity over clinical tests that show no difference. Future research should focus on developing easily applied methods for clinical use to differentiate between central and peripheral blood flow regulation disorders in individual patients.

Discharge Profiles of Identified GABAergic in Comparison to Cholinergic and Putative Glutamatergic Basal Forebrain Neurons across the Sleep-Wake Cycle	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ALPHA-2-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; LATERAL HYPOTHALAMUS; PARADOXICAL SLEEP; ANESTHETIZED RATS; C-FOS; WAKING; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ACETYLCHOLINE; TRANSPORTERS; ASSOCIATION	Whereas basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons are known to participate in processes of cortical activation during wake ( W) and paradoxical sleep ( PS or P, also called REM sleep), codistributed GABAergic neurons have been thought to participate in processes of cortical deactivation and slow-wave sleep (SWS or S). To learn the roles the GABAergic neurons might play, in relation to cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons, we juxtacellularly recorded and labeled neurons during natural sleep-wake states in head-fixed rats. Neurobiotin (Nb)-labeled cells were identified immunohistochemically as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)+, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)+, or ChAT-/GAD-. Of the latter, some were identified as glutamatergic by immunostaining of their terminals with the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT2). In contrast to ChAT+ neurons, which all discharged maximally during W and PS, GAD+ neurons comprised multiple sleep-wake subgroups. Some GABAergic neurons discharged maximally during W and PS, as WP-max active cells (36%), and in positive correlation with gamma electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Some discharged maximally during SWS, as S-max active cells (28%), and in positive correlation with delta EEG activity. Others increased their discharge progressively during sleep to discharge maximally during PS, as P-max active cells (36%), and in negative association with electromyographic (EMG) activity. ChAT-/GAD- cells comprised WP-max (46%), S-max (17%), P-max (17%), and W-max active cells (14%), whose discharge was positively correlated with EMG activity. GABAergic neurons would thus play similar or reciprocal roles to other cholinergic and glutamatergic BF neurons in regulating cortical activity and muscle tone along with behavior across sleep-wake states.

Elucidation of the mechanism of mitochondrial iron loading in Friedreich's ataxia by analysis of a mouse mutant	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						heme synthesis; iron; transferrin; frataxin	FRATAXIN HOMOLOG; HEME-SYNTHESIS; CLUSTER SYNTHESIS; PROTEINS; DEFICIENCY; EXPRESSION; MICE; INTERLEUKIN-6; METABOLISM; CELLS	We used the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) conditional frataxin knockout mouse to elucidate how frataxin deficiency alters iron metabolism. This is of significance because frataxin deficiency leads to Friedreich's ataxia, a disease marked by neurologic and cardiologic degeneration. Using cardiac tissues, we demonstrate that frataxin deficiency leads to down-regulation of key molecules involved in 3 mitochondrial utilization pathways: iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) synthesis (iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein1/2 and the cysteine desulferase Nfs1), mitochondrial iron storage (mitochondrial ferritin), and heme synthesis (5-aminolevulinate dehydratase, coproporphyrinogen oxidase, hydroxymethylbilane synthase, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, and ferrochelatase). This marked decrease in mitochondrial iron utilization and resultant reduced release of heme and ISC from the mitochondrion could contribute to the excessive mitochondrial iron observed. This effect is compounded by increased iron availability for mitochondrial uptake through (i) transferrin receptor1 up-regulation, increasing iron uptake from transferrin; (ii) decreased ferroportin1 expression, limiting iron export; (iii) increased expression of the heme catabolism enzyme heme oxygenase1 and down-regulation of ferritin-H and -L, both likely leading to increased "free iron" for mitochondrial uptake; and (iv) increased expression of the mammalian exocyst protein Sec15I1 and the mitochondrial iron importer mitoferrin-2 (Mfrn2), which facilitate cellular iron uptake and mitochondrial iron influx, respectively. Our results enable the construction of a model explaining the cytosolic iron deficiency and mitochondrial iron loading in the absence of frataxin, which is important for understanding the pathogenesis of Friedreich's ataxia.

These models explain error rates and reaction time distributions in a variety of tasks and are supported by neurophysiological studies showing that neural activity in several cortical and subcortical regions gradually builds up at a rate related to task difficulty and reaches a relatively constant level of discharge at a time that predicts movement initiation. The mechanism responsible for this buildup is believed to be related to the temporal integration of sequential samples of sensory information. However, an alternative mechanism that may explain the neural and behavioral data is one in which the buildup of activity is instead attributable to a growing signal related to the urgency to respond, which multiplicatively modulates updated estimates of sensory evidence. These models are difficult to distinguish when, as in previous studies, subjects are presented with constant sensory evidence throughout each trial. To distinguish the models, we presented human subjects with a task in which evidence changed over the course of each trial. Our results are more consistent with "urgency gating" than with temporal integration of sensory samples and suggest a simple mechanism for implementing trade-offs between the speed and accuracy of decisions.

Atlantic salmon exhibits extreme alternative life histories. We defined the gene-expression signatures of wild-caught salmon at two different life stages by comparing the brain expression profiles of mature sneaker males and immature males, and early migrants and late migrants. In addition to life-stage-specific signatures, we discovered a surprisingly large gene set that was differentially regulated-at similar magnitudes, yet in opposite direction-in both life history transitions. We suggest that this co-variation is not a consequence of many independent cellular and molecular switches in the same direction but rather represents the molecular equivalent of a physiological shift orchestrated by one or very few master regulators.

The immunological mechanisms of disease are largely unexplored in pediatric-onset MS, in part because studies have historically focused on adult-onset disease. We investigated autoantibodies to myelin surface Ags in a large cohort of pediatric MS cases by flow cytometric labeling of transfectants that expressed different myelin proteins. Although Abs to native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were uncommon among adult-onset patients, a subset of pediatric patients had serum Abs that brightly labeled the MOG transfectant. Abs to two other myelin surface Ags were largely absent. Affinity purification of MOG Abs as well as competition of binding with soluble MOG documented their binding specificity. Such affinity purified Abs labeled myelin and glial cells in human CNS white matter as well as myelinated axons in gray matter. The prevalence of such autoantibodies was highest among patients with a very early onset of MS: 38.7% of patients less than 10 years of age at disease onset had MOG Abs, compared with 14.7% of patients in the 10- to 18-year age group. B cell autoimmunity to this myelin surface Ag is therefore most common in patients with a very early onset of MS. The Journal of Immunology, 2009,183: 4067-4076.

The pig is a non-primate species that is immunologically closest to human. The proliferative zone of this neurogenic structure was first localized in situ in the pig brain by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry, as a ventral subfield of the Nissl-stained subventricular zone. For in vitro cultures, the striatal forebrain was sampled from deeply anaesthetized adult pigs and SVZ tissue explants were immediately microdissected out and dissociated in the appropriate medium. Primary cell culture in the presence of EGF and bFGF allowed growth of spherical masses that exhibited sustained growth and self-renewal capacity through six subsequent passages. Molecular characterization using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that expanded pro-differentiating neurospheres expressed markers of proliferation, neural stem cells, and committed neural progenitors. After growth factor removal, the spheres became adherent and were shown to contain the three neural cell lineages by triple immunocytofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The present protocol therefore allowed for in vitro expansion of pig brain primary cells that display capacities for proliferation, self-renewal, and multipotency, i.e., the cardinal features of multipotent neural precursor cells.

Burst firing induces postsynaptic LTD at developing mossy fibre-CA3 pyramid synapses	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; EXCITATORY SYNAPTIC-INTERACTIONS; RECEPTOR SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; RETINOTOPIC MAP REFINEMENT; GABA-MEDIATED INHIBITION; CA3 HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; AMPA RECEPTORS; EXTRACELLULAR POTASSIUM; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX	Synaptic development is an activity-dependent process utilizing coordinated network activity to drive synaptogenesis and subsequent refinement of immature connections. Hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (PYRs) exhibit intense burst firing (BF) early in development, concomitant with the period of mossy fibre (MF) development. However, whether developing MF-PYR synapses utilize PYR BF to promote MF synapse maturation remains unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that transient tonic depolarization of postsynaptic PYRs induces a persistent postsynaptic form of long-term depression (depolarization-induced long-term depression, DiLTD) at immature MF-PYR synapses. DiLTD induction is NMDAR independent but does require postsynaptic Ca<SU2+</SU influx through L-type voltage gated Ca<SU2+</SU channels (L-VGCCs), and is expressed as a reduction in AMPAR function through the loss of GluR2-lacking AMPARs present at immature MF-PYR synapses. Here we examined whether more physiologically relevant phasic L-VGCC activation by PYR action potential (AP) BF activity patterns can trigger DiLTD. Using combined electrophysiological and Ca<SU2+</SU imaging approaches we demonstrate that PYR BF effectively drives L-VGCC activation and that brief periods of repetitive PYR BF, produced by direct current injection or intrinsic network activity induces NMDAR-independent LTD by promoting Ca<SU2+</SU influx through the activated L-VGCCs. This BF induced LTD, just like DiLTD, is specific for developing MF-PYR synapses, is PICK1 dependent, and is expressed postsynaptically. Our results demonstrate that DiLTD can be induced by phasic L-VGCC activation driven by PYR BF, suggesting the engagement of natural PYR network activity patterns for MF synapse maturation.

Interindividual differences in withdrawal symptom severity are well known, and at least partially due to genetic variation. To identify genes contributing to variation in withdrawal severity, we chronically treated 30 strains of the AcB/BcA recombinant congenic mouse strain set, including their A/J and C57BL/6J (B6) progenitors, with morphine for seven days and compared jumping frequencies-a sensitive and widely used index of withdrawal magnitude-during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal (NPW). Jumping frequencies of B6 mice were more than threefold greater than values obtained in A/J mice. Visual inspection of the genomic distribution of parental haplotypes in the AcB/BcA strains identified a putative quantitative trait locus (QTL) localized to chromosome 8 (90-117 Mb), and this QTL was confirmed in a B6AF2 intercross. The most salient candidate gene within this QTL, Gnao1 (guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha(o); G alpha(o); 96.3 Mb), was tested for functional relevance using quantitative PCR and an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide strategy. The expression of Gnao1 in the locus coeruleus was found to be upregulated in morphine-dependent B6 but not A/J mice. Antisense knockdown of Gnao1 reduced NPWjumping in B6, but riot A/J, mice rendered dependent on either morphine or heroin, largely rescuing the original strain difference. These data strongly implicate the G alpha(o) protein in the locus coeruleus as contributing to interindividual variability in physical dependence on opioids in mice. (C) 2009 IBRO.

[(125)I]VpA, a compound selective in rodents and human for the AVP Via receptor, yielded the same labeling pattern as [(3)H]AVP, thus suggesting that most AVP receptors present in the marmoset brain are of the Via subtype. Numerous areas exhibited AVP binding sites, among which the olfactory bulb, the accumbens nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic, arcuate and ventromedial nuclei, the medial amygdaloid nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the cerebral cortex. Binding sites for [(125)I]OTA, a selective OT receptor antagonist in rat and human, were markedly less abundant than [(125)I]VPA ones, and, to a few exceptions, expressed in different areas. Neither AVP, nor OT binding sites were detected in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei identified by neurophysin immunoreactivity. Marked species-related differences were observed in the distribution of both AVP and OT binding sites. Altogether, our data provide a morphological basis to investigate the function of central AVP and OT in the marmoset. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

PAMPA measurements were performed, and the values were used to develop an in combo model, including Abraham descriptors. Published rodent K(in) values were used to enhance the dataset and validate the model. The model predicted 92% of the variance of the training set permeability. In all, 182 K(in) values were considered in this study, spanning four log orders of magnitude and where Pgp decreased brain uptake by as much as 14-fold. The calculated permeability-surface area (PS) values along with literature reported brain tissue binding were used to group molecules in terms of their brain penetration classification. The in situ BBB permeability can be predicted by the in combo PAMPA model to a satisfactory degree, and can be used as a lower-cost, high throughput first-pass screening method for FIN passive permeability.

However, spatially segregated neurons may exist in the peripheral olfactory organ of lampreys, extant representatives of ancestral jawless vertebrates. In lampreys, the caudoventral portion of the peripheral olfactory organ contains tubular diverticula, named the accessory olfactory organ (AOO). Short, ciliated AOO cells were retrogradely labelled following application of biocytin or carbocyanine dyes to the medial region of the olfactory bulb. Tracer application to eight radial locations within the layer of glomeruli with mitral cells, of the olfactory bulb, showed that AOO projections were restricted to the medial region of the olfactory bulb. The outer boundary of the AOO projection extended to the ventromedial region of glomerular neuropil in 43% of the specimens. The olfactory sensory neurons in the main olfactory epithelium projected to glomerular neuropil throughout the olfactory bulb, including sparse projections to the medial region of the olfactory bulb. This study shows that these AOO neurons and their projections in the medial region of the olfactory bulb are anatomically distinct regions of the primary olfactory pathway in the sea lamprey. J.

J	Zhou, WD; Gotman, J				Zhou, Weidong; Gotman, Jean			Automatic removal of eye movement artifacts from the EEG using ICA and the dipole model	PROGRESS IN NATURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Independent Component Analysis (ICA); Dipole model; Artifact; EEG	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC RECORDINGS; SEPARATION; LOCALIZATION; BRAIN	In this study, we proposed and evaluated the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) combining the EEG dipole model to automatically remove eye movement artifacts from the EEG without needing EOG as a reference. We separated the EEG data into independent components using the ICA method, and determined the source localization of these independent components with a single dipole model. The EEG signal was reconstructed by automatically excluding those components localized within a preset eye model. EEGs from 12 patients were analyzed. The experimental results indicate that ICA with the dipole model is very efficient at automatically subtracting the eye movement artifacts, while retaining the EEG slow waves and making their interpretation easier.

BDNF, Relative Preference, and Reward Circuitry Responses to Emotional Communication	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B-NEUROPSYCHIATRIC GENETICS			English	Review						facial expression; relative preference; fMRI; orbitofrontal cortex; BDNF	NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR VAL66MET; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER GENE; ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT SECRETION; CEREBRAL WHITE-MATTER; LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION; HUMAN AMYGDALA; DECISION-MAKING; HUMAN BRAIN; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS	Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates neural development and synaptic transmission. We have tested the hypothesis that functional variation in the BDNF gene (Val66Met polymorphism, rs6265) affects brain reward circuitry encoding human judgment and decision-making regarding relative preference. We quantified relative preference among faces with emotional expressions (angry, fearful, sad, neutral, and happy) by a keypress procedure performed offline to measure effort traded for viewing time. Keypress-based relative preferences across the ensemble of faces were mirrored significantly by fMRI signal in the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus when passively viewing these faces. For these three brain regions, there was also a statistically significant group difference by BDNF genotype in the fMRI responses to the emotional expressions. In comparison with Val/Met heterozygotes, Val/Val individuals preferentially sought exposure to positive emotions (e.g., happy faces) and had stronger regional fMRI activation to aversive stimuli (e.g., angry, fearful, and sad faces). BDNF genotype accounted for similar to 30% of the variance in fMRI signal that mirrors keypress responses to these stimuli. This study demonstrates that functional allelic variation in BDNF modulates human brain circuits processing reward/aversion information and relative preference transactions. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Paus, T; Toro, R				Paus, Tomas; Toro, Roberto			Could sex differences in white matter be explained by g ratio?	FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY			English	Review						myelin; axon; connectivity; adolescence; schizophrenia; brain development		Recent studies with magnetic resonance imaging suggest that age-related changes in white matter during male adolescence may indicate an increase in g ratio wherein the radial growth of an axon outpaces a corresponding increase in myelin thickness. We review the original Rushton (1951) model where a g ratio of similar to 0.6 represents an optimal relationship between the axon and fibre diameters vis-a-vis conduction velocity, and point out evidence indicating slightly higher g ratio in large-diameter fibres. We estimate that fibres with a diameter larger than 9.6 mu m will have a relatively thinner myelin sheath, and brains with increasingly larger proportions of such large-diameter fibres will have progressively lower concentration of myelin. We conclude by pointing out possible implications of "suboptimal" g ratio for the emergence of "disconnection" disorders, such as schizophrenia, in late adolescence.

Microtubules are dynamic structures that assemble from tubulin dimers to support intracellular transport of molecules and organelles. We show here that neurofilaments, and other intermediate-filament proteins, contain motifs in their N-terminal domains that bind unassembled tubulin. Peptides containing such motifs inhibit the in vitro polymerization of microtubules and can be taken up by cultured cells in which they disrupt microtubules leading to altered cell shapes and an arrest of division. In transgenic mice in which neurofilaments are withheld from the axonal compartment, axonal tubulin accumulation is normal but microtubules assemble in excessive numbers. These observations suggest a model in which axonal neurofilaments modulate local microtubule assembly. This capacity also suggests novel mechanisms through which inherited or acquired disruptions in intermediate filaments might contribute to pathogenesis in multiple conditions.

"Minimalist" mimics of P-turns were designed for this purpose. These mimics are (i) rigid, yet easily folded into turn-like conformations, and (ii) readily accessible from amino acids bearing most of the natural side chains. Gram quantities of 16 of these, turn mimics were prepared and then assembled into 152 fluorescein-labeled bivalent peptidomimetics via a solution-phase combinatorial method. Fluorescence-based screening of these molecules using cells transfected with the, Trk receptors identified 10 potential ligands of TrkC, the receptor for neurotrophin-3. Analogues of these bivalent peptidomimetics with biotin replacing the fluorescein label were then prepared and tested to confirm that binding was not due to the fluorescein, Several assays were conducted to find the mode of action of these, biotinylated compounds. Thus, direct binding, survival and neuritogenic, and biochemical signal transduction assays showed 8 of the original 10 hits were agonistic ligands binding to the ectodomain of TrkC. Remarkably, some peptidomimetics afford discrete signals leading to either cell survival or neuritogenic differentiation; The significance of,this work is three-fold. First, we succeeded in finding small, selective, proteolytically stable ligands for the TrkC receptor; there are very few of these in the literature. Second, we show that it is possible to activate distinct and biased signaling, pathways with ligands binding at the ectodomain of wild-type receptors. Third, the discovery that some peptidomimetics initiate different modes of cell signaling increases their potential as pharmacological probes and therapeutic leads.

J	Page, DD; Dumas, C				Page, Dominique Dorais; Dumas, Claude			Decision making and visibility in cats (Felis catus) in a progressive elimination task	ANIMAL COGNITION			English	Article						Decision making; Object permanence; Progressive elimination task	DOGS CANIS-FAMILIARIS; MONKEYS CEBUS-APELLA; INVISIBLE DISPLACEMENT; POP-OUT; LATERALIZATION; SEARCH; MEMORY; BRAIN	When making decisions animals can rely on information stored in memory and/or on information available through perceptual processes. Under some circumstances, perceptual access to a relevant piece of information can be lost as when a prey hides under a cover. If this piece of information is critical, the animal must be able to keep it active in the working memory until the final decision is made. Species endowed with object permanence can to a certain extent overcome such a lack of perceptual access. Numerous studies have investigated object permanence in animals, but no study systematically examined the interaction when making a decision between an information directly available through perception and an information that can no longer be perceived. In the present study, domestic cats (Felis catus) were administered a progressive elimination task in which they had to visit and deplete either two visible and one hidden target (e.g., Experiments 1 and 2) or one visible and two hidden targets (e.g., Experiments 3 and 4). The cats were brought back to the starting point after each visit to any target whether that target had been previously visited or not. The results revealed that the cats searched at the visible target(s) first and at the hidden target(s) last, which was referred to as the visibility rule. The results also revealed that the position of the bowl that was distinct (e.g., the visible bowl when the two other ones were hidden and the opposite) influenced the way this cognitive rule was implemented. More specifically, when the intermediate bowl was distinct the visibility rule was readily implemented but when either the right of the left bowl was distinct the visibility was violated. That is the cats did no longer choose the visible target(s) first. The visibility rule was interpreted in terms of optimization principles, the external distinct target effect was interpreted in terms of divided attention and lateralization.

However, to date little is known about the potential cooperative interplay between these 2 cytokines. In the current study, we sought to evaluate the frequency of IFN-gamma-expressing T(H)17 lymphocytes in MS and EA-E, and study their recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS). Methods: Human T(H)17 lymphocytes were expanded in vitro from the blood of healthy controls and relapsing MS patients using IL-23. Immune cell migration to the CNS was assessed in vitro with primary cultures of human blood-brain barrier (BBB)-derived endothelial cells, and in vivo in EAE mice. Results: We demonstrate that in response to IL-23, human memory lymphocytes expand into a T(H)17 phenotype, with a subpopulation of cells simultaneously expressing IFN-gamma and IL-17. We note that lymphocytes obtained from the blood of relapsing MS patients have an increased propensity to expand into IFN-gamma-producing T(H)17 cells and identify numerous T lymphocytes coexpressing IL-17 and IFN-gamma in brain tissue of MS patients. We also find lymphocytes expressing both the TH1- and the T(H)17-associated transcription factors ROR-gamma t and T-bet, in situ and in vitro. We further provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that IFN-gamma(+) T(H)17 lymphocytes preferentially cross the human BBB and accumulate in the CNS of mice during the effector phase of EAE. Interpretation: Our data underscore the involvement of IFN-gamma(+) T(H)17 lymphocytes in the pathology of MS and EAE and their preferential recruitment into the CNS during inflammatory events.

Design: Cross-sectional study of a population-based cohort. Setting: Saguenay Youth Study, Quebec, Canada, from November 2003 to June 2007. Participants: A total of 425 adolescents (225 girls aged 12-18 years). Outcome Measures: Systolic and diastolic BP measured using a Finometer. Secondary outcome measures were (1) hemodynamic parameters also measured with a Finometer, (2) body composition assessed with magnetic resonance imaging, bioimpedance, and anthropometry, and (3) metabolic indices determined from a fasting blood sample. Results: Girls vs boys demonstrated lower systolic and diastolic BP at rest and during challenges, with the differences being greatest during a math-stress test (adjusted difference, 7 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4-10 mm Hg and adjusted difference, 6 mm Hg; 95% CI, 4-8 mmHg, respectively). The differences were mainly due to girls vs boys having lower stroke volume while lying down, standing (adjusted difference, 4 mL; 95% CI, 1-7 mL), and sitting, and lower total peripheral resistance during the math-stress test (adjusted difference, 0.14 mm Hg.s/mL; 95% CI, 0.09-0.21 mm Hg.s/mL). Intra-abdominal fat was positively associated with BP, but less in girls than in boys, and fat-free mass, fat mass, and insulin resistance were also positively associated with BP, similarly in boys and girls. Conclusions: In adolescence, BP is lower in girls than boys, with the difference being determined mainly by lower stroke volume during physical challenges and by lower total peripheral resistance during mental challenges. Body composition and insulin resistance contribute to these differences.

Design: Group comparison study. Setting: Gait analysis laboratory within a postacute rehabilitation facility. Participants: Volunteer sample (N=18). Persons with moderate to severe TBI (n=11) (9 men, 3 women; age, 37.56 13.79y) and a comparison group (n=7)of subjects without neurologic problems matched on average for body mass index and age (4 men, 3 women; age, 39.19 +/- 17.35y). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Magnitudes and variability for walking speeds, foot clearance margins (ratio of foot clearance distance to obstacle height), and response reaction times (both direct and as a relative cost because of obstacle avoidance). Results: The TBI group had well-recovered walking speeds and a general ability to avoid obstacles. However, these subjects did show lower trail limb toe clearances (P=.003) across all conditions. Response reaction times to the Stroop tasks were longer in general for the TBI group (P=.017), and this group showed significant increases in response reaction times for the visual modality within the more challenging obstacle avoidance task that was not observed for control subjects. A measure of multitask costs related to differences in response reaction times between obstructed and unobstructed trials also only showed increased attention costs for the visual over the auditory stimuli for the TBI group (P=.002). Conclusions: Mobility is a complex construct, and the present results provide preliminary findings that, even after good locomotor recovery, subjects with moderate to severe TBI show residual locomotor deficits in multitasking. Furthermore, our results suggest that sensory modality is important,	[McFadyen, Bradford J.; Fait, Philippe] Univ Laval, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Rehabil & Social Integr, Quebec City, PQ G1M 2S8, Canada; [McFadyen, Bradford J.; Fait, Philippe] Univ Laval, Fac Med, Dept Rehabil, Quebec City, PQ G1M 2S8, Canada; [Swaine, Bonnie] Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Rehabil Greater Montrea, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Swaine, Bonnie] Montreal Rehabil Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Swaine, Bonnie] Univ Montreal, Sch Rehabil, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Doyon, Julien] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Cantin, Jean-Francois; Duchesneau, Guylaine; Dumas, Denyse] Quebec Rehabil Inst, Quebec City, PQ, Canada	McFadyen, BJ (reprint author), Univ Laval, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Rehabil & Social Integr, 525 Hamel, Quebec City, PQ G1M 2S8, Canada.	brad.mcfadyen@rea.ulaval.ca		Fait, Philippe/0000-0002-2554-9273	Canadian Institutes of Health Research [64408]	Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (grant no. 64408).		26	14	14	1	9	W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC	PHILADELPHIA	1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA	0003-9993			ARCH PHYS MED REHAB	Arch.

Methods: We genotyped 18 promoter polymorphisms in SAT1 in a French-Canadian population. The relationship between haplotypes and gene expression was assessed with microarray analysis of three brain regions as well as reporter gene assays in three cell lines. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to examine the role of individual polymorphisms in reporter gene expression. Results: We identified two major and several minor haplotypes in the promoter region of SAT1. Subjects who possessed the haplotype containing the risk allele for rs6526342 demonstrated decreased SAT1 expression in BA4, BA8/9, and BA11. This haplotype was also associated with decreased expression in reporter gene assays. Site-directed mutagenesis identified three polymorphisms-an insertion/deletion (rs6151267), and two SNPs (rs6526342 and rs928931)-that were involved in determining reporter gene expression. These polymorphisms do not seem to exert their effects through the polyamine responsive element, because all constructs were induced to a similar extent in the presence of spermine. Conclusions: Our results indicate that genetic variations in the promoter region of SAT1 are involved in determining levels of gene expression and might provide a mechanism for the decreased SAT1 expression observed in suicide completers.

Functional and Structural Connectivity Between the Perigenual Anterior Cingulate and Amygdala in Bipolar Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Amygdala; anterior cingulate cortex; bipolar disorder; diffusion tensor imaging; fMRI; functional connectivity; magnetic resonance imaging	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DIFFUSION-TENSOR; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; MOOD DISORDERS; ABNORMALITIES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EMOTION; MONKEY; MANIA; ADOLESCENTS	Objective: Abnormalities in the morphology and function of two gray matter structures central to emotional processing, the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) and amygdala, have consistently been reported in bipolar disorder (BD). Evidence implicates abnormalities in their connectivity in BD. This study investigates the potential disruptions in pACC-amygdala functional connectivity and associated abnormalities in white matter that provides structural connections between the two brain regions in BD. Methods: Thirty-three individuals with BD and 31 healthy comparison subjects (HC) participated in a scanning session during which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during processing of face stimuli and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed. The strength of pACC-amygdala functional connections was compared between BD and HC groups, and associations between these functional connectivity measures from the fMRI scans and regional fractional anisotropy (FA) from the DTI scans were assessed. Results: Functional connectivity was decreased between the pACC and amygdala in the BD group compared with HC group, during the processing of fearful and happy faces (p < .005). Moreover, a significant positive association between pACC-amygdala functional coupling and FA in ventrofrontal white matter, including the region of the uncinate fasciculus, was identified (p < .005). Conclusion: This study provides evidence for abnormalities in pACC-amygdala functional connectivity during emotional processing in BD. The significant association between pACC-amygdala functional connectivity and the structural integrity of white matter that contains pACC-amygdala connections suggest that disruptions in white matter connectivity may contribute to disturbances in the coordinated responses of the pACC and amygdala during emotional processing in BD.

In the present study, a modified AB paradigm was used in which targets could appear in any of four simultaneous RSVP streams, one in each quadrant of the visual field. In half of the trials, T1 and T2 were displayed in the same visual hemifield (either left or right) and, in the other half, T1 and T2 were displayed in different visual hemifields. Using this paradigm with both neurologically intact individuals and a split-brain patient, we sought to investigate (1) possible hemispheric asymmetries in attentional processes, and (2) whether the AB would be reduced when targets are displayed in different visual hemifields. A comparable AB was found for both neurologically intact individuals and the split-brain patient, with no significant variations due to whether targets were displayed in the same or in different hemifields. A left hemisphere advantage in the processing of same and different hemifield targets was observed only in the split-brain patient. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper sets out the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) guidelines for the safety monitoring of widely used agents in the treatment of bipolar disorder. These guidelines aim to provide recommendations that take into consideration the balance between safety and cost-effectiveness, to highlight iatrogenic and preventive clinical issues, and to facilitate the broad implementation of therapeutic safety monitoring as a standard component of treatment for bipolar disorder. Methods: These guidelines were developed by an ISBD workgroup, headed by the senior author (MB), through an iterative process of serial consensus-based revisions. After this, feedback from a multidisciplinary group of health professionals on the applicability of these guidelines was sought to develop the final recommendations. Results: General safety monitoring recommendations for all bipolar disorder patients receiving treatment and specific monitoring recommendations for individual agents are outlined. Conclusions: These guidelines are derived from evolving and often indirect data, with minimal empirical cost-effectiveness data available to provide guidance. These guidelines will therefore need to be modified to adapt to different clinical settings and health resources. Clinical acumen and vigilance remain critical ingredients for safe treatment practice.

The Impact of Human Superoxide Dismutase 1 Expression in a Mouse Model on the Embryotoxicity of Hydroxyurea	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH PART A-CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR TERATOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	48th Annual Meeting of the Teratology-Society	JUN 28-JUL 02, 2008	Monterey, CA	Teratol Soc		oxidative stress; reactive oxygen species; superoxide; teratogen; hydroxyurea; Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase	FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGER; DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY; REDOX STATUS; CELL-DEATH; RAT FETUS; MICE; ORGANOGENESIS; EMBRYOS; TERATOGENICITY; GLUTATHIONE	BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is hypothesized to mediate embryotoxicity during organogenesis, yet the reactive oxygen species involved are not defined. The superoxide oxygen radical is converted to hydrogen peroxide, a less reactive species, by superoxide dismutases (SODs). If superoxide is important in. mediating embryotoxicity, increased SOD expression should protect embryos against insult. Exposure to hydroxyurea during organogenesis causes brain defects, cleft palate, tail anomalies, and limb defects; administration of D-mannitol, a free radical scavenger, ameliorates hydroxyurea embryotoxicity, suggesting that oxidative stress is important. To elucidate the role of superoxide in mediating hydroxyurea embryotoxicity, we assessed the impact of human SOD1 expression in a murine model. METHODS: hSOD1 hemizygous male mice, carrying the human SOD1 gene, were mated to wild-type or hSOD1. hemizygous females. Dams were treated on gestation day (GD) 9 with saline (control) or 400 (low) or 600 (high) mg/kg hydroxyurea (n = 8-13/group). Mice were euthanized on GD 18 and developmental toxicity was assessed. RESULTS: Exposure to hydroxyurea caused a dose-dependent increase in fetal deaths that was not affected by hSOD1 expression; hydroxyurea decreased fetal weights in litters from wild-type but not hemizygous darns. Hydroxyurea increased the incidence of external and skeletal malformations; fetuses from hemizygous dams treated with high-dose hydroxyurea had fewer malformations compared to wild-type dams. There was no correlation between embryonic phenotype and genotype or SOD activity. CONCLUSION: Maternal hSOD1 expression protected fetuses against malformations induced by hydroxyurea, providing evidence that superoxide plays a role in mediating the response of organogenesis stage embryos to this teratogen.

With their lower airflow resistance, large cross-sectional area ETAHEs have been found to be more energy efficient than the conventional small ones, especially when integrated in hybrid ventilation systems. However, the lack of available methods for determining the heat convection at the duct surfaces has made accurate energy simulation and proper system design overly difficult. In this study, numerical experiments using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were conducted to investigate the airflow and thermal behavior in the large ducts. A two-layer turbulence model was used to ensure accuracy in resolving the flow information in the near-wall region, which is critical for predicting accurate heat convection. The modeling method was verified by comparing its results with measurements from literature. Parametric studies were conducted to identify the influential design and operation variables for the heat convection. Thirty numerical experimental setups designed with the Latin Hypercube Sampling method were simulated to prepare a database with six design parameters as the simulation inputs and average Nusselt numbers over the duct ceiling, wall, and floor as the outputs. Based on the database an artificial neural network (ANN) model was trained to build a mathematical relation between the design variables and the Nusselt numbers. The developed ANN model showed very accurate prediction when compared with test data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bouchard, J; Presse, N; Ferland, G				Bouchard, Joanie; Presse, Nancy; Ferland, Guylaine			Study on the link between aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition in active geriatric unit patients	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DIETETIC PRACTICE AND RESEARCH			French	Article							DYSPHAGIA; RISK; PREDICTORS	Purpose: To study the association between malnutrition and aspiration pneumonia (AP) in patients from active geriatric units and describe patients who developed AP. Methods: Cases of AP were identified from archived medical charts of two active geriatric units between 2001 and 2007 (n=2238). The prevalence of neurologic disorders, dysphagia and malnutrition was assessed in patients who developed AP and those who did not. Results: Cumulative incidence of AP was low in both units investigated (1.1%). Aspiration pneumonia was highly associated with neurologic disorders (stroke and Parkinson's disease) and dysphagia (p<0.01), and tended to be more prevalent in those who were malnourished (p<0.10). In AP cases, about 80% of patients were malnourished assessed by the dietitians, a result supported by a high prevalence of nutritional risk indicators. Conclusions: Results support the hypothesis that malnutrition Could have contributed to AP in these two active geriatric units. Prevention and treatment of malnutrition, especially in dysphagic patients, could reduce risk of AP in hospitalized elderly.

Methods: We reviewed the files of 77 medically intractable BTLE patients who underwent ICES with positive results through implanted DEs and then were under surgical treatment. One year or more after surgery, we evaluated the outcome. ICES was performed through: 1) Square-wave bipolar stimulation with symmetrical pulses of 60 Hz for 0.5 ms was delivered by a constant current Nuclear Chicago stimulator; 2) An initial intensity of 0.5 mA, and subsequently progressively stronger currents at 1-2 and occasionally 3 or 4 mA; 3) The duration of a single stimulation was usually 5 seconds; 4) The volume of tissue effectively stimulated did not exceed 5 mm. Results: We obtained habitual auras or seizures (clinical responses, CRs) in 74 patients and after-discharges, ADs in 61 of them, according to Engel's classification for post surgery outcomes. If CRs or ADs were obtained by stimulation of only one temporal lobe the result of epilepsy surgery tended to be better (Engel classes I or II) when the operation was done on the same side of positive CRs (15 cases) or ADs (14 cases), and tended to be worse (Engel classes III or IV) when the ICES had provoked bilateral responses or when the side operated on was contra-lateral to positive CRs (33 cases) or ADs (28 cases). Statistical analyses were performed in order to test these results and we found better post-operative results when the resection took place in the same side of positive responses to ICES (CRs: chi(2) 4.74 and p=0.0295; ADs: chi(2) 7.57 and p=0.0059). Conclusion: In addition to other methods (PET, MRI and neuropsychology) presurgical ICES can provide useful data in the process of identifying the temporal lobe to be targeted for resection in BTLE patients.

We utilized a novel 3-dimensional assay to identify how (a) radiation, (b) excision of the primary tumour aggregate, and (c) both treatments combined influence MB cell invasiveness. Methods: Five MB cell lines (UW228-1, 2 and 3; Daoy, and Madsen) were implanted onto 3-dimensional, type I collagen gel assay to assess tumour invasion distance over five days, in response to (1) needle-assisted excision of the central cell aggregate; (2) pre-exposure to single-dose and fractionated dose irradiation in doses from 6-25 and 8-24 Gy, respectively; and (3) excision plus either single-dose or fractionated radiation. Results: Within hours, individual MB cells detached from the surface of the cell aggregates and invaded the collagen matrix, to distances up to 1200 mu m and at rates up to 300 mu m daily. The UW228-1 cell line was less invasive than the other cell lines and was dropped from further analysis. In the four remaining lines, a dose-dependent decline in tumour invasiveness was identified, both for single-dose and fractionated radiation, which achieved statistically decreased invasion distances at higher doses, especially of fractionated irradiation. Excision of the central tumour aggregate tended towards exerting a late effect on cell invasion, but exerted no significant influence on the radio-sensitivity of residual cells. Conclusions: Both single-dose and fractionated dose irradiation appear to inhibit MB cell invasiveness in a dose-dependent manner, whereas excision of the central cell aggregate exerts no effect on residual invading cells.

Neural Substrates of Self-Regulatory Control in Children and Adults With Tourette Syndrome	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE			English	Article						Tourette syndrome; children; impulse control; cognitive inhibition; anterior cingulate cortex; basal ganglia; neuroimaging; functional magnetic resonance imaging	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SCALE; BASAL GANGLIA VOLUMES; AFFECTIVE-DISORDERS; TIC SEVERITY; HUMAN BRAIN; FOLLOW-UP; K-SADS; RELIABILITY; FMRI; PSYCHOPATHOLOGIES	Objective: To identify the neural substrate of self-regulatory control in children and adults with Tourette syndrome (TS). Method: We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural correlates of cognitive self-regulation during the Simon task. Forty-two people from The Tic Disorder Specialty Clinic who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for diagnosis with TS (24 children; 18 adults) were compared with 37 control subjects (19 children; 18 adults). Patients with TS were excluded from participation if they had any Axis I psychiatric disorder other than obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prior to the onset of TS. Control participants were excluded if they reported a history of tic disorder, OCD, ADHD, or if they met diagnostic criteria for any Axis I disorder at the time of interview. Results: We detected greater overall fMRI activation in adults than in children across both diagnostic groups, primarily in frontal and striatal regions. In both groups we also detected an age-related shift away from more general cortical activation toward a more specific reliance on frontostriatal activity, a developmental correlate that was exaggerated in the TS group despite behavioural performances similar to those of control subjects. Moreover, the severity of tics correlated positively with frontal activations across age groups. Conclusion: Frontostriatal circuits support cognitive and behavioural control. These circuits likely contribute both to optimal performance in this self-regulatory task and to the regulation of the severity of tics. Adults with persistent TS likely possess deficient activity in these circuits, attributable to either a failure of prefrontal plasticity or to disturbances in striatal functioning.

In the present study, a group of eleven non-demented PD patients and eleven healthy control (HC) participants were tested on their ability to interpret communicative intentions underlying verbal irony and lies, as well as on their ability to infer first- and second-order mental states (i.e., theory of mind). Following Winner et al. (1998), participants answered different types of questions about the events which unfolded in stories which ended in either an ironic statement or a lie. Results showed that PD patients were significantly less accurate than HC participants in assigning second-order beliefs during the story comprehension task, suggesting that the ability to make a second-order mental state attribution declines in PD. The PD patients were also less able to distinguish whether the final statement of a story should be interpreted as a joke or a lie, suggesting a failure in pragmatic interpretation abilities. The implications of frontal lobe dysfunction in PD as a source of difficulties with working memory, mental state attributions, and pragmatic language deficits are discussed in the context of these findings.

Here, we examine the possibility that these after-effects might depend on two distinct neural pathways (geniculostriate vs. collicular-extrastriate). To this end, patients with a lesion of the striate cortex (hemianopic patients) or temporoparietal cortex (neglect patients) were asked to localize weak sounds, before and after a brief exposure to repetitive auditory-visual stimulation which was given either in the normal or in the affected field. Adaptation comprised spatially disparate (Experiment 1) or spatially coincident (Experiment 2) auditory-visual stimuli. After exposure to spatially disparate stimuli in the normal field, all patients exhibited the usual shifts toward the visual attractor, at each sound location. In contrast, when the same kind of adaptation was given in the affected field, a consistent shift was still evident in neglect patients but not in patients with hemianopia. After adaptation to spatially coincident stimuli, and regardless of the adaptation hemifield, all patients exhibited a significant improvement in auditory localization, which was largest for sounds presented at the adapted location. The findings suggest the presence of two distinct recalibration mechanisms. Adapting to spatially conflicting stimuli invokes a corrective mechanism implemented within the geniculostriate circuit, which tries to reduce the registered discrepancy. Adapting to spatially aligned inputs invokes a mechanism implemented along a collicular-extrastriate circuit, which tries to reduce the localization error.

TBI activates numerous cellular mechanisms and molecular cascades that produce detrimental outcomes, including neuronal death and loss of function. The mitochondrion is one of the major targets of TBI, as seen by increased mitochondrial activity in activated and proliferating microglia (due to high energy requirements and/or calcium overload) as well as increased reactive oxygen species, changes in mitochondrial permeability transition, release of cytochrome c, caspase activation, reduced ATP levels, and cell death in neurons. Translocator protein (TSPO) is an 18-kDa outer mitochondrial membrane protein that interacts with the mitochondria permeability transition pore and binds with high affinity to cholesterol and various classes of drug ligands, including some benzodiazepines such as 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864). Although TSPO levels in the brain are low, they are increased after brain injury and inflammation. This finding has led to the proposed use of TSPO expression as a marker of brain injury and repair. TSPO drug ligands have been shown to participate in the control of mitochondrial respiration and function, mitochondrial steroid and neurosteroid formation, as well as apoptosis.

J	Ateme-Nguema, B; Dao, TM				Ateme-Nguema, Barthelemy; Dao, Thien-My			Quantized Hopfield networks and tabu search for manufacturing cell formation problems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management	MAY 30-JUN 02, 2007	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA			Metaheuristic; Quantized networks; Hybrid approach; Manufacturing cells	GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS; COST	The use of neural networks in the design of cellular manufacturing system is not new. This paper presents an application of modified Hopfield neural networks in order to solve cell formation problems: the quantized and fluctuated Hopfield neural networks (QFHN). This kind of Hopfield network combined with the "tabu search" approach were primarily used in a hybrid procedure in order to solve the cell formation for big sizes industrial data set. The problem is formulated as a 0/1 linear and integer programming model in order to minimize the dissimilarities between machines and/or parts. Our hybrid approach allows us to obtain optimal or nearly optimal solutions very frequently and much more quickly than traditional Hopfield networks. It is also illustrated that the fluctuation associated with this quantization may enable the network to escape from local minima, to converge to global minima, and consequently to obtain optimal solutions very frequently and much more quickly than pure quantized Hopfield networks (QHN). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is flexibility it gives us, for example, in time problem-solving for large-scale and speed of execution when we apply it. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Group I (n = 393) included those patients with gliosis or normal tissue and Group 11 (n = 107) included patients with space-occupying lesions. For cortical stimulation, a unipolar voltage-controlled electrode was used. The tongue, lip, and hand/finger sequences over the lower postcentral gyrus lateromedially in both groups were in agreement with classic teaching. The presence of structural lesions, such as tumors and dysplasia, did not affect the vertical representation of the body parts on the lower sensory strip. Individual variations, which included mosaicism over the sensory strip, were frequent. Whether the functional variability and mosaicism within the sensory cortex result from a pathological condition or not remains to be elucidated in healthy humans using advanced non-invasive brain mapping techniques.

Data analyzed: A total of 222 cases extracted from a clinical database (57-91 years) of patients screened for cognitive impairment in outpatient geriatric assessment clinics. Data collected: Demographic information and individual item responses to Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Results: Comparison of the data with a unidimensional Rasch model indicated that the total score obtained by summing across all items yields a reliable (0.75) quantitative estimate of global cognitive ability. All items fit the model and together spanned a range of difficulty from - 3.75 to + 2.88 logits. Items were assessed for differential item functioning across such patient characteristics as age, education, and language spoken. We provide a table for converting Montreal Cognitive Assessment total scores onto a linearly scaled score, with guidelines for interpreting changes in Montreal Cognitive Assessment score in terms of their statistical significance. Conclusions: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment can provide a reliable and valid quantitative estimate of cognitive ability in a geriatric cognitive disorders clinic setting.

Participants: Thirty-four children with MTBI (aged 8-16 years) and 34 control children matched for age, sex, and premorbid level of physical activity. Main Measure: Activity diary documenting the exact level of activity during 3 consecutive days during the 1st, 4th, and 12th week post-MTBI (corresponding time intervals for controls) and the Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results: Fifteen pairs of children (MTBI + control) completed the diaries for all 3 assessment times (77% participation rate among consecutive admissions and 44% compliance rate with diary completion). Although some children engaged in activities before the end of the 4-week restriction period, the majority of the children followed the recommendations they received. Children with MTBI maintained a lower level of energy expenditure at the 1- and 4-week evaluations than did the noninjured children, but not at the 12-week evaluation. Conclusion: Children with MTBI usually comply with the activity restrictions they receive upon discharge from the hospital.

Interactions of ghrelin signaling pathways with the GH neuroendocrine axis: a new and experimentally tested model	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							GROWTH-HORMONE-SECRETION; MESSENGER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; SECRETAGOGUE RECEPTOR; ULTRADIAN RHYTHM; (GH)-RELEASING FACTOR; ACYLATED PEPTIDE; ARCUATE NUCLEUS; FOOD-INTAKE; RATS	Growth hormone (GH) is secreted in a pulsatile fashion from the pituitary gland into the circulation. Release is governed by two hypothalamic neuropeptides, growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (SRIF), resulting in secretion episodes with a periodicity of 3.3 h in the male rat. Ghrelin is an additional recently identified potent GH-secretagogue. However, its in vivo interactions with the GH neuroendocrine axis remain to be elucidated. Moreover, two different sites of ghrelin synthesis are involved, the stomach and the hypothalamus. We used our previously developed core model of GH oscillations and added the sites of ghrelin action at the pituitary and in the hypothalamus. With this extended model, we simulated the effects of central and peripheral ghrelin injections, monitored the GH profile and compared it with existing experimental results. Systemically administered ghrelin elicits a GH pulse independent of SRIF, but only in the presence of GHRH. The peripheral ghrelin signal is mediated to the brain via the vagus nerve, where it augments the release of GHRH and stimulates the secretion of neuropeptide-Y (NPY). By contrast, centrally administered ghrelin initiates a GH pulse by increasing the GHRH level and by antagonizing the SRIF block at the pituitary. In addition, NPY neurons are activated, which trigger a delayed SRIF surge. The major novel features of the present model are a) the role played by NPY, and b) the dissimilar functions of ghrelin in the hypothalamus and at the pituitary. Furthermore, the predictions of the model were experimentally examined and confirmed.

Although CGRP is widely distributed in the brain, little is known about the effects of supraspinal CGRP. We used AKR and C57BL/6 mice as a model to explore the effects of centrally (intracerebroventricular) injected CGRP and the CGRP receptor antagonists, CGRP(8-37) and BIBN4096BS, in a series of behavioral assays. Locomotor activity was significantly increased in C57BL/6 mice following the injection of BIBN4096BS and in both strains after the administration of CGRP(8-37) into the third ventricle. CGRP increased paw-withdrawal latencies in C57BL/6 mice only, while decreasing depression-like behaviors in both strains in the forced-swimming test. CGRP and CGRP receptor antagonists failed to modulate activity in the elevated plus maze, a model of anxiety. Taken together, these results suggest a complex role for supraspinal CGRP systems in the regulation of locomotion, nociception, and depression-like behaviors.

A few studies have shown that RHD individuals may exhibit moderate difficulties in tasks requiring attribution of second-order mental states (ToM), Suggesting a link between pragmatic and ToM abilities. Although links seem to exist between pragmatic abilities, TOM and executive functions in other populations, no study had tested those three abilities in RHD individuals to explore the possible co-occurrence of impairments in these three abilities. This study evaluated pragmatic and ToM abilities and executive functions in 15 RHD individuals and 15 healthy control participants. The results suggest that the ability to understand pragmatic aspects of language is closely associated with the ability to make inferences about other people's intentions. More interestingly, the association of ToM deficits with executive dysfunction rather than executive dysfunction alone might be the best predictor of different patterns of pragmatic deficits found in different RHD subgroups of patients.

First published June 24, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.91295.2008. This event-related functional MRI study examines the neural correlates of vibrotactile sensation within the context of different psychophysical demands. Nine subjects received vibrotactile stimuli on the right volar forearm during detection, localization, and passive tasks. In the detection task, subjects indicated the offset ( end) of each stimulus by pressing a response key with their left hand. In the localization task, subjects identified the location of the stimulus ("distal?" or "proximal?") by pressing the appropriate response key 4 s after the end of the stimulus. In the passive task, subjects received the same vibrotactile stimuli, but no response was required. Analysis of stimulus-evoked activity compared with the resting baseline period revealed significant bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex activation for all three tasks. However, only in the offset-detection and localization tasks was stimulus-evoked activation observed in other expected areas of tactile processing, such as contralateral primary somatosensory cortex neighboring the posterior parietal cortex (SI/PPC) and in bilateral anterior insular cortex (aIC). During the localization task, we identified vibrotactile-evoked activation in the right aIC, which was maintained after the termination of the stimulus. Results suggest that vibrotactile-related activation within SI/PPC and aIC is enhanced by the increased levels of attention and cognitive demands required by the detection and localization tasks. Activation of aIC not only during vibrotactile stimulation, but also during the poststimulus delay in the localization trials, is consistent with the growing literature linking this area with the perception and short-term memory of tactile information.

Domain-specific cognitive effects of tramiprosate in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: ADAS-cog subscale results from the Alphase study	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION HEALTH & AGING			English	Article							AMYLOID-BETA; DECLINE	Tramiprosate (homotaurine, ALZHEMED (TM)) was recently investigated for its efficacy, safety and disease-modification effects in a Phase III clinical study in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (the Alphase study). The primary cognitive endpoint measure of that study was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). To characterize potential cognitive benefits of tramiprosate, the present study describes exploratory analyses performed on scores obtained from the specific ADAS-cog subscales in order to determine whether specific domains of cognition may be differentially affected by tramiprosate, which would not have been evident from the measure's total score. Multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. 67 investigative sites in the United States and Canada. A total of 1,052 patients were randomized. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive twice a day Placebo (n=353), tramiprosate 100 mg (n=352) and tramiprosate 150 mg (n=347). ADAS-cog assessments were conducted every three months over the 78-week study period. Exploratory analyses were performed by comparing ADAS-cog subscale scores between Placebo and each active treatment arm at each visit. The findings of this analysis revealed statistically significant differences or statistical trends in favour of tramiprosate on six ADAS-cog subscales, namely Following Commands, Language Comprehension, Ideational Praxis, Object Naming, Remembering Test Instructions, and Spoken Language Ability. Differences in favor of Placebo were only observed on the Constructional Praxis subscale. This exploratory analysis suggests that tramiprosate may have some benefit on memory, language and praxis skills in mild to moderate AD individuals. Future clinical studies of tramiprosate should include specialized neuropsychological tests to validate its effects within these cognitive domains.

Psychiatric morbidity has been observed in up to 81% of patients with US but findings with VVS are contradictory. Little is known regarding the chronicity of their psychiatric morbidity. Objective: To determine the psychological profile of patients with recurrent syncope prior to and following diagnostic head-up tilt testing (HUT), and whether it predicts syncope recurrence. Method: Seventy-three women and 43 men (mean age=48 +/- 16.6) were recruited from all consenting patients referred for HUT. Psychological status (Psychiatric Symptom Index, Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), Fear of Blood Injury Subscale) and presence of mood/anxiety disorders (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders) were evaluated I month prior to and 6 months following HUT. Follow-up data were collected for 83 patients (mean age=48 +/- 17.34). Results: At baseline, clinically significant levels of distress were observed in 60% of patients. Those with US (negative HUT) had a fivefold greater risk of suffering from a depressive or anxiety disorder compared to VVS (positive HUT) after controlling for significant covariates. There was no significant change in distress level over follow-up, although psychiatric morbidity dropped from 33% to 22% (P=.049). Syncope recurrence was predicted by elevations in baseline psychological distress (OR=1.544, P=.013) independently of lifetime number of syncopes. Conclusions: Patients exhibited high levels of psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity despite reassurance and education received after HUT. Improved screening for and treatment of psychological distress in these patients is critical. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It will be argued that indigenous pluralism is a theoretically and practically useful concept for bioethics as well and hence should be incorporated into bioethical methodology and processes of bioethical policy formation. Subsequently, the notion of indigenous pluralism will be discussed in relation to determinations of death as a means of illustrating this concept's applicability to bioethical inquiry.

Practice Management Guidelines for Identification of Cervical Spine Injuries Following Trauma: Update From the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma Practice Management Guidelines Committee	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Article							LOW-RISK CRITERIA; BLUNT TRAUMA; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; GUNSHOT WOUNDS; RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION; EXTENSION RADIOGRAPHS; CLINICAL INDICATIONS; CLEARANCE PROTOCOL; OBTUNDED PATIENTS; HEAD-INJURY	Background: Injury to the cervical spine (CS) is common after major trauma. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma first published its Practice Management Guidelines for the evaluation of CS injury in 1998. A subsequent revision was published in 2000. Since that time a large volume of literature has been published. As a result, the Practice Management Guidelines Committee set out to develop updated guidelines for the identification of CS injury. Methods: A search of the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health MEDLINE database was performed using PubMed (www.pubmed.gov). The search retrieved English language articles regarding the identification of CS injury from 1998 to 2007. The questions posed were: who needs CS imaging; what imaging should be obtained; when should computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or flexion/extension radiographs be used; and how is significant ligamentous injury excluded in the comatose patient? Results: Seventy-eight articles were identified. From this group, 52 articles were selected to construct the guidelines. Conclusion: There have been significant changes in practice since the previous CS injury guidelines. Most significantly, computed tomography has supplanted plain radiography as the primary screening modality in those who require imaging. Clinical clearance remains the standard in awake, alert patients with trauma without neurologic deficit or distracting injury who have no neck pain or tenderness with full range of motion. Cervical collars should be removed as soon as feasible. Controversy persists regarding CS clearance in the obtunded patient without gross neurologic deficit, (J Trauma. 2009;67: 651-659)	[Como, John J.] Metrohlth Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Trauma Crit Care & Burns, Cleveland, OH 44109 USA; [Diaz, Jose J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Surg, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Dunham, C.

Methods: This prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial has evaluated the effect of daily local intravaginal application of Prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone; DHEA) for 12 weeks on the domains of sexual dysfunction, namely, desire/interest, arousal, orgasm, and pain at sexual activity, in 216 postmenopausal women with moderate to severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Results: A time- and dose-dependent improvement of the four domains of sexual function was observed. At the 12-week time interval, the 1.0% DHEA dose led, compared with placebo, to 49% (P = 0.0061) and 23% (P = 0.0257) improvements of the desire domains in the Menopause Specific Quality of Life and Abbreviated Sex Function questionnaires, respectively. Compared with placebo, the Abbreviated Sex Function arousal/sensation domain was improved by 68% (P = 0.006), the arousal/lubrication domain by 39% (P = 0.0014), orgasm by 75% (P = 0.047), and dryness during intercourse by 57% (P = 0.0001). Conclusions: By a local action in the vagina, DHEA applied daily at doses at which serum steroids remain well within normal postmenopausal values exerts relatively potent beneficial effects on all four aspects of sexual dysfunction. Such data indicate that combined androgenic/estrogenic stimulation in the three layers of the vagina exerts important beneficial effects on sexual function in women without systemic action on the brain and other extravaginal tissues.

In rodents, administration of antibodies to cubilin, a component of the intestinal receptor responsible for cobalamin absorption, results in a Variety of defects including neural tube defects. There is no direct evidence that this is mediated through a direct effect on cobalamin metabolism. Homozygosity for inactive versions of the genes for CUBN coding for cubilin, AMN, coding for amnionless, the MTR gene coding for methionine synthase, or MTRR coding for methionine synthase reductase, is embryonic lethal in mice. Homozygosity for a hypomorphic form of the MTRR gene is associated with increased occurrence of defects. In man, the following have been associated with neural tube defects: decreased maternal serum and amniotic fluid levels of vitamin B(12), decreased serum levels of cobalamin bound to the serum transport protein transcobalamin; increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid; and the G allele in mothers and embryos at the 66A>G polymorphism in the MTRR gene. A Prospective Study to determine whether fortification of food with vitamin B(12) in addition to folic acid might decrease the incidence of birth defects to a greater extent than does fortification with folic acid alone is warranted.

Here we show that the benzamide derivative N-[2-(4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-3-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1-(tert-butyl-1H-indol-3-yl-methyl)-2-oxo-ethyl]-4-nitrobenzamide (SP-10) inhibits dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP)-induced corticosteroid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner in Y-1 adrenal cortical mouse tumor cells, without affecting basal steroid synthesis and reduced stress-induced corticosterone increases in rats without affecting the physiological levels of the steroid in blood. SP-10 did not affect cholesterol transport and metabolism by the mitochondria but was unexpectedly found to increase 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A, low density lipoprotein receptor, and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) expression. However, it also markedly reduced dbcAMP-induced NBD-cholesterol uptake, suggesting that this is a compensatory mechanism aimed at maintaining cholesterol levels. SP-10 also induced a redistribution of filamentous (F-) and monomeric (G-) actin, leading to decreased actin levels in the submembrane cytoskeleton suggesting that SP-10-induced changes in actin distribution might prevent the formation of microvilli-cellular structures required for SR-BI-mediated cholesterol uptake in adrenal cells.

Structural equation modeling was used to identify significant pathways between exogenous variables of conscientiousness, openness, and education to need for cognition, and between neuroticism and health to perceived control. Need for cognition and perceived control emerged as separate and distinct forms of motivation, contributing to positive and negative affect in this model through differing patterns and to different degrees. Mediators between need for cognition and positive affect were frequency of cognitive activity and problem-focus coping. Perceived control had direct effects on positive and negative affect and indirect effects through cognitive activity on positive affect. The model helps to explain some of the psychological mechanisms instrumental in successful adaptation to change in adulthood. The dispositional motivation of need for cognition is described as a character strength with unique predictive value for older adults.

We show here that ex vivo GIFT15 treatment of mouse splenocytes generates suppressive regulatory cells of B cell ontogeny (hereafter called GIFT15 B(reg) cells). Arising from CD19(+) B cells, GIFT15 B(reg) cells express major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) and MHCII, surface IgM and IgD, and secrete IL-10, akin to previously described B10 and T2-MZP B(reg) cells, but lose expression of the transcription factor PAX5, coupled to upregulation of CD138 and reciprocal suppression of CD19. Mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis went into complete remission after intravenous infusion of GIFT15 B(reg) cells paralleled by suppressed neuroinflammation. The clinical effect was abolished when GIFT15 B(reg) cells were derived from m mu MT (lacking B cells), MHCII-knockout, signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT-6)-knockout, IL-10-knockout or allogeneic splenocytes, consistent with a pivotal role for MHCII and IL-10 by sygeneic B cells for the observed therapeutic effect. We propose that autologous GIFT15 B(reg) cells may serve as a new treatment for autoimmune ailments.

Recently, it has been suggested that statins could be beneficial to AD patients independently from their cholesterol-lowering effects. Using 10 month-old amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (APP mice), we sought to reverse cerebrovascular, neuronal and memory impairments with simvastatin (20 mg/kg/day, 8 weeks). Simvastatin improved reactivity of cerebral arteries, rescued the blood flow response to neuronal activation, attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation, and reduced cortical soluble amyloid-beta (A(3) levels and the number of A(3 plaque-related dystrophic neurites. However, at such an advanced stage of the pathology. it failed to reduce A(3 plaque load and normalize cholinergic and memory deficits. These findings demonstrate that low-dose simvastatin treatment in aged APP mice largely salvages cerebrovascular function and has benefits on several AD landmarks, which could explain some of the positive effects of statins reported in AD patients.

Cortisol, the final hormone of this axis, affects metabolic, cardiovascular and central nervous systems both acutely and chronically. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have led to the investigation of regulatory networks and mechanisms of cortisol regulation in the central nervous system in human populations. In the following review, results from human and animal studies are being presented that investigate the specific role of hippocampus (HC), amygdala (AG), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and brainstem nuclei in cortisol regulation in response to stress. In general, the types of stressors need to be distinguished when discussing the contributions of these Structures in regulating the HPA axis. We propose a basic framework oil how these Structures communicate as a network to regulate cortisol secretion in response to psychological stress. Furthermore, we review critical studies that have substantially contributed to the literature. Possible future research avenues in the field of neuroimaging of cortisol regulation are discussed. In combination with investigations on genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of the HPA axis, this emerging new research will eventually allow the formulation of a more comprehensive framework of functional neuroanatomy of cortisol regulation.

Nevertheless, little is known about the time Course of these changes or the relationship of anatomical changes to perception and behaviour. In the present Study, We use a Fat model of neuropathic pain (spared nerve injury, SNI) and 7 T MRI to determine the longitudinal supraspinal changes associated with pain-like and anxiety-like behaviours. SNI rats and sham controls were scanned at seven time points, I week before surgery, 2 weeks after, and then once a month for 5 months. At each time point we performed behavioural tests, including thermal and mechanical sensitivity, and tests of locomotion and exploratory behaviour. (open field and elevated plus maze). We found that SNI rats had early and sustained thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, and developed anxiety-like behaviour's several months after injury. Compared to sham controls, SNI rats had decreased frontal cortex volumes several months after surgery, coincident with the onset of anxiety-like behaviours. There was also decreased Volume in retrosplenial and entorhinal cortices. We also explored areas that correlated with mechanical hyperalgesia and found that increased hyperalgesia was associated with decreased volumes in bilateral S1 hindlimb area, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, areas 32 and 24), and insula. Overall, Our results suggest that long-term neuropathic pain has widespread effects on brain anatomy related to the duration and Magnitude of the pain. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Whether their treatment can slow down the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unsettled. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate whether the treatment of VRF is associated with a slower cognitive decline in patients who have AD without cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Methods: We recruited 301 consecutive patients who had AD without CVD (mean age 71.7 years; 69.4% women; first Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] mean score 21.6; mean follow-up 2.3 years), who had attended a memory clinic between 1997 and 2003. VRF sought were high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and atherosclerotic disease. Only 21 patients (7.0%) had no VRF. Others were classified as having no VRF treated (n = 72; 25.7%), some VRF treated (n = 119; 42.5%), or all VRF treated (n = 89; 31.8%). We compared MMSE progression over time among these 3 groups using a mixed random effects regression model. Results: Baseline MMSE scores were similar in the 3 groups. With adjustment for confounding factors, MMSE progression over time differed significantly between groups (p = 0.002). Patients with all their VRF treated declined less than those with none of their VRF treated. Those with some VRF treated tended to have an intermediate decline. Conclusions: In patients who have Alzheimer disease without CVD, treatment of vascular risk factors (VRF) is associated with a slower decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this association, but our data suggest that dementia should not prevent treatment of VRF.

The results indicate that contingent negative variation (CNV) and P300 components changed according to task demands. In the time-related task, amplitudes and duration of both components increased as a function of stimulus duration and easier discriminability. This was not the case in the size discrimination task. These results are in accordance with the hypothesis of a functional link between PFC and PPC in timing behavior. The later-appearing LPCt component was observed in both tasks, but its amplitude increased only as a function of stimulus duration.

Forcht; Prestigiacomo, Charles J.; Preul, Mark C.			Anatomy, technology, art, and culture: toward a realistic perspective of the brain	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS			English	Article						brain illustration; anatomy; dissection; neurosurgical history; linear perspective		In the 15th century, brain illustration began to change from a schematic system that involved scant objective rendering of the brain, to accurate depictions based on anatomical dissections that demanded significant artistic talent. Notable examples of this innovation are the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci (1498-1504), Andreas Vesalius' association with the bottega of Titian to produce the drawings of Vesalius' De humani corporis fabrica (1543), and Christopher Wren's illustrations for Thomas Willis' Cerebri Anatome (1664). These works appeared during the Renaissance and Age of Enlightenment, when advances in brain imaging, or really brain rendering, reflected not only the abilities and dedications of the artists, but also the influences of important cultural and scientific factors. Anatomy and human dissection became popular social phenomena as well as scholarly pursuits, linked with the world of the fine arts. The working philosophy of these artists involved active participation in both anatomical study and illustration, and the belief that their discoveries of the natural world could best be communicated by rendering them in objective form (that is, with realistic perspective). From their studies emerged the beginning of contemporary brain imaging. In this article, the authors examine how the brain began to be imaged in realism within a cultural and scientific milieu that witnessed the emergence of anatomical dissection, the geometry of linear perspective, and the closer confluence of art and science.

Vania			Prefrontal cortex and spinal cord mediated anti-neuropathy and analgesia induced by sarcosine, a glycine-T1 transporter inhibitor	PAIN			English	Article						Allodynia; Nerve injury; D-Cycloserine; Gavage; Tactile sensitivity	CHRONIC BACK-PAIN; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RAT MODEL; MODULATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DEHYDROGENASE; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS; ALLODYNIA; RESPONSES	Sarcosine is a competitive inhibitor of glycine type 1 transporter. We hypothesized that it may have analgesic and anti-neuropathic efficacy by a dual action: affecting neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex as well as within the spinal cord. In rats with spared nerve injury (SNI) oral sarcosine reduced mechanical sensitivity for the injured limb (and-neuropathy or anti-allodynia) as well as for the uninjured limb (analgesia), showing better dose efficacy for the injured limb. Intrathecal administration of sarcosine was more effective in reducing mechanical sensitivity for the uninjured paw. In contrast, prefrontal cortex infusions of sarcosine acutely reduced mechanical sensitivity for the injured paw. Repeated daily oral sarcosine induced anti-neuropathy, observed only after days of repeated treatment: this long-term effect disappeared a few days after treatment cessation. The findings indicate that manipulating glycine-T1 transporter at multiple central sites can induce acute analgesia, as well as acute and long-term reduction in neuropathic pain behavior. Analgesic effects seem primarily mediated through spinal cord circuitry while anti-neuropathic effects seem mediated through prefrontal cortex circuitry, most likely through distinct molecular pathways. The results suggest that such an approach may provide a novel venue for treating clinical pain conditions. (C) 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We previously showed that maternal care provided to pups experiencing pain reduced adult pain sensitivity. This study tested whether sensory stimulation was responsible for this effect. Rat pups were either mother-reared controls (MR-CON) or artificially reared (AR) with minimal (AR-MIN) or maximal (AR-MAX) stimulation provided daily. In each rearing condition, pups were either uninjected or injected from postnatal day (PND) 4 to 14 with saline (0.9%) or formalin (0.2-0.4%). Pain behavior and paw inflammation were scored. Thermal sensitivity and responses to formalin were tested in adulthood (PND 70). AR neonates, irrespective of sensory stimulation received, exhibited a pain response (p < 0.001), even with a mild formalin dose. Maternal rearing reduced inflammation during the second week of life compared with AR pups (p < 0.05). Early pain exposure did not modify adult pain sensitivity. However, rearing altered adult pain sensitivity such that uninjected MR-CON rats had lower pain sensitivities than uninjected AR rats (p < 0.05). This suggests that the beneficial effects of maternal rearing can be obliterated if additional stimulation/stress occurs during the early neonatal period. In addition, this suggests that optimal level of maternal stimulation exists that determines adult pain sensitivity.

AVP is the most important bioactive substance in PVN regulating pain process. Our pervious study has pointed that pain stimulation induced AVP increase in the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM), which plays a role in pain modulation. The present study was designed to investigate the source of AVP in the rat NRM during pain process using the methods of nucleus push-pull perfusion and radioimmunoassay. The results showed that pain stimulation increased the AVP concentration in the NRM perfusion liquid, PVN cauterization inhibited the role that pain stimulation induced the increase of AVP concentration in the NRM perfusion liquid, and PVN microinjection of L-glutamate sodium, which excited the PVN neurons, could increase the AVP concentration in the NRM perfusion liquid. The data suggested that AVP in the PVN might be transferred to the NRM to participate in pain modulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CDF Collaboration	Search for hadronic decays of W and Z bosons in photon events in p(p)over-bar collisions at root s=1.96 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							SILICON VERTEX DETECTOR; CERN PBARP COLLIDER; GAMMA PRODUCTION; QCD CORRECTIONS; FERMILAB; COUPLINGS	We report on a search for the process p (p) over bar -> gamma + W/Z with W/Z -> q (q) over bar in events containing two jets and a photon at the center-of-mass energy root s 1.96 TeV, using 184 pb(-1) of data collected by the CDF II detector. A neural network event selection has been developed to optimize the rejection of the large QCD production background; it is shown that this method gives a significant improvement in both signal-to-noise ratio and signal sensitivity, as compared with an event selection based on conventional cuts. An upper limit is presented for the gamma + W/Z production cross section with the W and Z decaying hadronically.	[Chen, Y. C.; Hou, S.; Lu, R. -S.; Mitra, A.; Teng, P. K.; Wang, S.

Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based controllers for smart material actuator modelling	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART G-JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						smart material actuator; neuro-fuzzy controller; simulation; modelling; testing	ALGORITHM	An intelligent approach for smart material actuator modelling of the actuation lines in a morphing wing system is presented, based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems. Four independent neuro-fuzzy controllers are created from the experimental data using a hybrid method - a combination of back propagation and least-mean-square methods - to train the fuzzy inference systems. The controllers' objective is to correlate each set of forces and electrical currents applied on the smart material actuator to the actuator's elongation. The actuator experimental testing is performed for five force cases, using a variable electrical current. An integrated controller is created from four neuro-fuzzy controllers, developed with Matlab/Simulink software for electrical current increases, constant electrical current, electrical current decreases, and for null electrical current in the cooling phase of the actuator, and is then validated by comparison with the experimentally obtained data.

This sustained posterior contralateral magnetic (SPCM) field is likely the magnetic equivalent of the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN) found in electrophysiology. Magnetoencephalography data showed, at the sensor level, a bilateral activation over the parietal cortex that increased in amplitude for higher memory load. Others sensors, also over the parietal cortex, showed an activation pattern similar to the SPCN with higher activation for the hemisphere contralateral to the visual field from which visual information was encoded. These two activation patterns suggest that the SPCN and SPCM are generated by a network of cortical sources that includes bilateral parietal loci, likely intra-parietal/intra-occipital cortex, and contralateral parietal sources.

Hence, these cells act as a useful source for acquiring renewable adult cell lines. This, in turn, acts as a potent therapeutic tool to treat various diseases related to the heart, liver and kidney, as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. However, a major problem that must be overcome before it can be effectively implemented into the clinical setting is a suitable delivery system that can retain an optimal quantity of the cells at the targeted site for a maximal clinical benefit; a system that will give a mechanical as well as an immune protection to the foreign cells, while at the same time enhancing the yields of differentiated cells, maintaining cell microenvironments and sustaining the differentiated cell functions. To address this issue we opted for a novel delivery system, termed the 'artificial cells', which are semipermeable microcapsules with strong and thin multilayer membrane components with specific mass transport properties. Here, we briefly introduce the concept of artificial cells for encapsulation of stem cells and investigate the application of microencapsulation technology as an ideal tool for all stem transplantations and relate their role to the emerging field of cellular cardiomyoplasty.

Methods: In two separate experiments, brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) during a Meditation condition and a Control condition. In the Meditation condition, participants were asked to mentally visualize and emotionally connect with the "being of light" allegedly encountered during their "near-death experience". In the Control condition, participants were instructed to mentally visualize the light emitted by a lamp. Results: In the fMRI experiment, significant loci of activation were found during the Meditation condition (compared to the Control condition) in the right brainstem, right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, right medial prefrontal cortex, right superior parietal lobule, left superior occipital gyrus, left anterior temporal pole, left inferior temporal gyrus, left anterior insula, left parahippocampal gyrus and left substantia nigra. In the EEG experiment, electrode sites showed greater theta power in the Meditation condition relative to the Control condition at FP1, F7, F3, T5, P3, O1, FP2, F4, F8, P4, Fz, Cz and Pz. In addition, higher alpha power was detected at FP1, F7, T3 and FP2, whereas higher gamma power was found at FP2, F7, T4 and T5. Conclusions: The results indicate that the meditative state was associated with marked hemodynamic and neuroelectric changes in brain regions known to be involved either in positive emotions, visual mental imagery, attention or spiritual experiences.

Neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus throughout development into adulthood and is believed to modulate hippocampal function. This study used a Fat model in which bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is administered to pregnant dams, to test if prenatal immune activation has acute and/or long term effects on various phases of neurogenesis (proliferation, survival, differentiation) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of offspring. When LPS was administered to dams on gestation days (GD) 15 and 16, there was decreased proliferation of dentate cells at postnatal day (PD) 14 and decreased survival of cells generated at PD14 in offspring. When prenatal exposure to LPS was later in pregnancy (GD 18 and 19) offspring showed, decreased survival of cells generated both at the time of LPS exposure and at PD14. There was no change in cell proliferation or survival in adult offspring at PD60, with prenatal LPS exposure. Co-administration of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (IBU), together with prenatal LPS on GD 15 and 16, was unable to prevent the deficit in neuronal survival at PD14. IBU blocked LPS-induced fever but did not block LPS-induced increases in plasma cytokines and corticosterone in the pregnant dam. This indicates that deficits in neurogenesis caused by prenatal LPS are not mediated by LPS-induced fever or eicosanoid induction, but could be mediated by LPS-induced increases in maternal cytokines or corticosterone.

They result from failure of neural tube closure during early embryonic life. Their etiology is complex, involving environmental and genetic factors that interact to modulate the incidence and severity of the developing phenotype. Despite a long history of etiologic studies, the molecular and cellular pathogenic mechanisms underlining NTDs remain poorly understood. The major epidemiologic finding in NTDs is the protective effect of perinatal folic acid supplementation that reduces their risk by 60%-70%. Genetic studies in NTDs have focused mainly on folate-related genes and identified a few significant associations between variants in these genes and an increased risk for NTDs. The candidate gene approach investigating genes involved in neurulation and inferred from animal models has faced limited success in identifying major causative genes predisposing to NTDs. However, we are witnessing a rapid and impressive progress in understanding the genetic basis of NTDs, based mainly on the development of whole genome innovative technologies and the powerful tool of animal models.

Substantial evidence has accumulated implicating a deficit in endocannabinoid in the etiology of depression; accordingly, pharmacological augmentation of endocannabinoid signaling could be a novel target for the pharmacotherapy of depression. Within preclinical models, facilitation of endocannabinoid neurotransmission evokes both antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Similar to the actions of conventional antidepressants, enhancement of endocannabinoid signaling can enhance serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission; increase cellular plasticity and neurotrophin expression within the hippocampus; and dampen activity within the neuroendocrine stress axis. Furthermore, limbic endocannabinoid activity is increased by both pharmacological and somatic treatments for depression, and, in turn, appears to contribute to some of the neuroadaptive alterations elicited by these treatments. These preclinical findings support the rationale for the clinical development of agents which inhibit the cellular uptake and/or metabolism of endocannabinoids in the treatment of mood disorders.

Perceiving motion transparency in the absence of component direction differences	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Motion transparency; Fourier spectrum; Phase; Speed; Global motion	HUMAN VISUAL-SYSTEM; PHENOMENAL COHERENCE; MOVING PLAIDS; MT NEURONS; PERCEPTION; INFORMATION; PATTERNS; SIGNALS; ENERGY; MODEL	The simultaneous perception of multiple motion components within the same region in the visual field is a difficult processing task, which can be solved by human observers for a range of transparently moving stimuli. We use transparently moving gratings to study this phenomenon psychophysically, focussing on configurations in which individual components move in the same direction and can only be discriminated by speed differences. We first demonstrate that the stimuli are perceived as transparent and then proceed to quantify how the strength of motion transparency changes while component grating parameters such as fundamental spatial frequency, speed and luminance are varied. The results were consistent with perception resolving a signal detection task of separating two superimposed global motion signals corresponding to each of the components. We also identify the importance of broadband stimuli containing edges, both for perceiving transparency with the same direction stimulus configuration, and for static transparency. The local density of edges has a direct influence on the strength of perceived transparency, suggesting that local motion detection at the edges of the stimuli, which is sensitive to speed differences, may be critical to solve the task. The work suggests that there may be a simultaneous retinotopic representation of the two speeds of motion analogous to that accomplished by the motion direction tuned neurons found across regions of visual cortex.

Multimodal Integration in Rostral Fastigial Nucleus Provides an Estimate of Body Movement	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; MACULAR VESTIBULAR INPUTS; CANAL-NECK INTERACTION; CERVICAL SPINAL-CORD; GALVANIC STIMULATION; REFERENCE FRAMES; HEAD ROTATION; EYE-MOVEMENTS; POSTURAL RESPONSES; CEREBELLAR NUCLEI	The ability to accurately control posture and perceive self-motion and spatial orientation requires knowledge of the motion of both the head and body. However, whereas the vestibular sensors and nuclei directly encode head motion, no sensors directly encode body motion. Instead, the convergence of vestibular and neck proprioceptive inputs during self-motion is generally believed to underlie the ability to compute body motion. Here, we provide evidence that the brain explicitly computes an internal estimate of body motion at the level of single cerebellar neurons. Neuronal responses were recorded from the rostral fastigial nucleus, the most medial of the deep cerebellar nuclei, during whole-body, body-under-head, and head-on-body rotations. We found that approximately half of the neurons encoded the motion of the body in space, whereas the other half encoded the motion of the head in space in a manner similar to neurons in the vestibular nuclei. Notably, neurons encoding body motion responded to both vestibular and proprioceptive stimulation (accordingly termed bimodal neurons). In contrast, neurons encoding head motion were sensitive only to vestibular inputs (accordingly termed unimodal neurons). Comparison of the proprioceptive and vestibular responses of bimodal neurons further revealed similar tuning in response to changes in head-on-body position. We propose that the similarity in nonlinear processing of vestibular and proprioceptive signals underlies the accurate computation of body motion. Furthermore, the same neurons that encode body motion (i.e., bimodal neurons) most likely encode vestibular signals in a body-referenced coordinate frame, since the integration of proprioceptive and vestibular information is required for both computations.

A survey of present understanding	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Review						Growth plate; Bone; Endochondral growth; Mechanical loading; Mechanobiology	LONGITUDINAL BONE-GROWTH; MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE-3; POSTNATAL-GROWTH; HYPERTROPHIC CHONDROCYTES; PERIOSTEAL DIVISION; ARTICULAR-CARTILAGE; TENSILE PROPERTIES; FEMALE GYMNASTS; DIFFERENT RATES; X COLLAGENS	The longitudinal growth of long bones occurs in growth plates where chondrocytes synthesize cartilage that is subsequently ossified. Altered growth and subsequent deformity resulting from abnormal mechanical loading is often referred to as mechanical modulation of bone growth. This phenomenon has key implications in the progression of infant and juvenile musculoskeletal deformities, such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, hyperkyphosis, genu varus/valgus and tibia vara/valga, as well as neuromuscular diseases. Clinical management of these deformities is often directed at modifying the mechanical environment of affected bones. However, there is limited quantitative and physiological understanding of how bone growth is regulated in response to mechanical loading. This review of published work addresses the state of knowledge concerning key questions about mechanisms underlying biomechanical modulation of bone growth. The longitudinal growth of bones is apparently controlled by modifying the numbers of growth plate chondrocytes in the proliferative zone, their rate of proliferation, the amount of chondrocytic hypertrophy and the controlled synthesis and degradation of matrix throughout the growth plate. These variables may be modulated to produce a change in growth rate in the presence of sustained or cyclic mechanical load. Tissue and cellular deformations involved in the transduction of mechanical stimuli depend on the growth plate tissue material properties that are highly anisotropic, time-dependent, and that differ in different zones of the growth plate and with developmental stages. There is little information about the effects of time-varying changes in volume, water content, osmolarity of matrix, etc. on differentiation, maturation and metabolic activity of chondrocytes. Also, the effects of shear forces and torsion on the growth plate are incompletely characterized. Future work on growth plate mechanobiology should distinguish between changes in the regulation of bone growth resulting from different processes, such as direct stimulation of the cell nuclei, physico-chemical stimuli, mechanical degradation of matrix or cellular components and possible alterations of local blood supply.

Cognitive impairment and reduced life span of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy homozygotes	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							BUKHARA JEWS; PABP2 GENE; NUCLEAR INCLUSIONS	Objective: To assess the evolution and life expectancy in patients with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) who are homozygotes for two (GCN) 13 expansions in the PABPN1 encoding gene. Background: OPMD is particularly frequent among French Canadians (FCs) and Uzbek Jews (UJs), who carry a same size, (GCN) 13, PABPN1 mutation. The high rate of consanguinity among UJs together with late disease onset and normal fertility results in homozygous cases. Methods: For 15 to 20 years, we followed 4 FC and 6 UJ homozygotes with OPMD and compared them with their heterozygous parents and siblings. In addition to clinical evaluation, electro-diagnostic tests, psychological tests, and brain imaging studies were performed. Results: In all (GCN) 13-(GCN) 13 patients, OPMD started before age 35 years, with bilateral ptosis and dysphagia; external ophthalmoparesis and dysphonia followed within a few years, as well as weakness in proximal limb muscles. All patients had recurrent aspirations and lost weight; 4 patients required surgical interventions to alleviate dysphagia, and 5 required feeding gastrostomies. Most patients were followed by psychiatrists due to cognitive decline, recurrent depression, or psychotic episodes. Six patients died at ages 50, 51, 53, 56, 56, and 57 years. The eldest patient is now 51 years old; she is cachectic and requires special diet and psychiatric care for paranoid psychosis and uninhibited behavior. Conclusions: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy progresses faster in homozygote compared with heterozygote patients. It is not restricted to the muscles, but also involves the CNS with cognitive decline and psychotic manifestations and leads to a reduced life expectancy. Neurology (R) 2009; 73: 596-601	[Blumen, S.

Spectro-temporal modulation transfer function of single voxels in the human auditory cortex measured with high-resolution fMRI	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						auditory system; cortical representation; dynamic ripples	RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; NATURAL SOUNDS; HUMAN BRAIN; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; TEMPORAL ENVELOPE; DYNAMIC RIPPLES; CORTICAL FIELDS; SPECTRAL MOTION; UNIT RESPONSES; REPRESENTATION	Are visual and auditory stimuli processed by similar mechanisms in the human cerebral cortex? Images can be thought of as light energy modulations over two spatial dimensions, and low-level visual areas analyze images by decomposition into spatial frequencies. Similarly, sounds are energy modulations over time and frequency, and they can be identified and discriminated by the content of such modulations. An obvious question is therefore whether human auditory areas, in direct analogy to visual areas, represent the spectro-temporal modulation content of acoustic stimuli. To answer this question, we measured spectro-temporal modulation transfer functions of single voxels in the human auditory cortex with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We presented dynamic ripples, complex broadband stimuli with a drifting sinusoidal spectral envelope. Dynamic ripples are the auditory equivalent of the gratings often used in studies of the visual system. We demonstrate selective tuning to combined spectro-temporal modulations in the primary and secondary auditory cortex. We describe several types of modulation transfer functions, extracting different spectro-temporal features, with a high degree of interaction between spectral and temporal parameters. The overall low-pass modulation rate preference of the cortex matches the modulation content of natural sounds. These results demonstrate that combined spectro-temporal modulations are represented in the human auditory cortex, and suggest that complex signals are decomposed and processed according to their modulation content, the same transformation used by the visual system.

For example, different preferences are expressed when options are encountered one at a time or concurrently. This phenomenon has been attributed to differences in the "evaluability" of a particular attribute when comparison to an option with a different value of this attribute is or is not available. Research on the preferences of laboratory animals has often been carried out by means of operant-conditioning methods. Formal treatments of operant behavior relate preferences to variables such as the strength and cost of reward but do not address the evaluability of these variables. Two experiments assessed the impact of procedural factors likely to alter the evaluability of an opportunity cost ("price"): the work time required for a rat to earn a train of rewarding electrical brain stimulation. The results support the notion that comparison between recently encountered prices is necessary to render the price variable highly evaluable. When price is held constant over many trials and test sessions, the evaluability of this variable appears to decline. implications are discussed for the design of procedures for estimating subjective reward strengths and costs in operant-conditioning experiments aimed at characterizing, identifying and understanding neural circuitry underlying evaluation and choice.

These lysosomal events begin rapidly and simultaneously with mitochondrial permeabilization and caspase activation within 3 h after drug treatment. In this study, comparative and quantitative proteome analyses were performed to identify early changes in lysosomal protein expression/localization from U-937 cells undergoing apoptosis. in 2 independent experiments, among a total of more than 538 proteins putatively identified and quantitated by iTRAQ isobaric labeling and LC-ESI-MS/MS, 18 proteins were found to be upregulated and 9 downregulated in lysosomes purified from early apoptotic compared to control cells. Protein expression was validated by Western blotting on enriched lysosome fractions, and protein localization confirmed by fluorescence confocal microscopy of representative protein candidates, whose functions are associated with lysosomal membrane fluidity and dynamics. These include sterol-4-alpha-carboxylate 3-dehydrogenase (NSDHL), prosaposin (PSAP) and protein kinase C delta (PKC-delta). This comparative proteome analysis provides the basis for novel hypothesis and rationale functional experimentation, where the 3 validated candidate proteins are associated with lysosomal membrane fluidity and dynamics, particularly cholesterol, sphingolipid and glycosphingolipid metabolism.

J	Jemel, B; Coutya, J; Langer, C; Roy, S				Jemel, Boutheina; Coutya, Julie; Langer, Caroline; Roy, Sylvain			From upright to upside-down presentation: A spatio-temporal ERP study of the parametric effect of rotation on face and house processing	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; INVERTED FACES; HUMAN BRAIN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES; CONFIGURAL INFORMATION; RECOGNITION PROCESSES; OBJECT RECOGNITION; THATCHER ILLUSION; SELECTIVE CORTEX; FAMILIAR OBJECTS	Background: While there is a general agreement that picture-plane inversion is more detrimental to face processing than to other seemingly complex visual objects, the origin of this effect is still largely debatable. Here, we address the question of whether face inversion reflects a quantitative or a qualitative change in processing mode by investigating the pattern of event-related potential (ERP) response changes with picture plane rotation of face and house pictures. Thorough analyses of topographical (Scalp Current Density maps, SCD) and dipole source modeling were also conducted. Results: We find that whilst stimulus orientation affected in a similar fashion participants' response latencies to make face and house decisions, only the ERPs in the N170 latency range were modulated by picture plane rotation of faces. The pattern of N170 amplitude and latency enhancement to misrotated faces displayed a curvilinear shape with an almost linear increase for rotations from 0 degrees to 90 degrees and a dip at 112.5 degrees up to 180 degrees rotations. A similar discontinuity function was also described for SCD occipito-temporal and temporal current foci with no topographic distribution changes, suggesting that upright and misrotated faces activated similar brain sources. This was confirmed by dipole source analyses showing the involvement of bilateral sources in the fusiform and middle occipital gyri, the activity of which was differentially affected by face rotation. Conclusion: Our N170 findings provide support for both the quantitative and qualitative accounts for face rotation effects. Although the qualitative explanation predicted the curvilinear shape of N170 modulations by face misrotations, topographical and source modeling findings suggest that the same brain regions, and thus the same mechanisms, are probably at work when processing upright and rotated faces. Taken collectively, our results indicate that the same processing mechanisms may be involved across the whole range of face orientations, but would operate in a non-linear fashion. Finally, the response tuning of the N170 to rotated faces extends previous reports and further demonstrates that face inversion affects perceptual analyses of faces, which is reflected within the time range of the N170 component.

Here, we demonstrate that activation of PKC Apl II is highly sensitive to the pattern of 5HT application. Spaced applications downregulate PKC translocation through PKA signaling, whereas massed applications lead to persistent translocation of PKC. Differential regulation of PKC translocation is mediated by competing feedback mechanisms that act through protein synthesis. These studies elucidate a fundamental molecular difference between spaced and massed training protocols.

Long-term Outcomes in Survivors of Neuroblastoma: A Report From the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE			English	Article							ADVANCED-STAGE NEUROBLASTOMA; BONE-MARROW-TRANSPLANTATION; 2ND MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS; HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA; 5-YEAR SURVIVORS; LATE MORTALITY; NORDIC COUNTRIES; ADULT SURVIVORS; CHILDREN; CHEMOTHERAPY	Background The 5-year survival rate for individuals with neuroblastoma is approaching 70%. Few data exist, however, on the long-term outcomes of these patients, who are often treated at a very young age. Methods Outcome data were obtained for 954 5-year neuroblastoma survivors who were diagnosed in 1970-1986 and enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). Late mortality, second malignant neoplasms, and chronic health conditions were analyzed in relation to treatment factors using Poisson regression models and their modification with generalized estimating equations. Neuroblastoma survivors were compared with a cohort of 3899 siblings of CCSS participants for risk of chronic health conditions and selected sociodemographic outcomes. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Six percent of patients died more than 5 years after their diagnosis (standardized mortality ratio = 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4 to 6.9). The most common causes of death were disease recurrence (n = 43) and second malignant neoplasms (n = 13). The cumulative incidence of second malignant neoplasms was 3.5% at 25 years and 7.0% at 30 years after diagnosis. Compared with the sibling cohort, survivors had an increased risk of selected chronic health conditions (risk ratio [RR] = 8.3; 95% CI = 7.1 to 9.7) with a 20-year cumulative incidence of 41.1%. The most prevalent outcomes involved the neurological, sensory, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems, with 20-year cumulative incidences of 29.8%, 8.6%, 8.3%, and 7.8%, respectively. Neuroblastoma survivors who were treated with multimodality therapy were more likely to develop a chronic health condition than survivors treated with surgery alone (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.6 to 3.0). Neuroblastoma survivors were less likely than siblings to have ever been employed (P = .04) or to be married (P < .001) and had a lower personal income (P = .009). Conclusions Neuroblastoma survivors have an increased rate of mortality and second malignant neoplasms, relative to the age- and sex-comparable US population, and of chronic health conditions, relative to their siblings, which underscores the need for long-term medical surveillance.

In this study, we identified a family with high rates of suicidal behavior and assessed brain gene expression levels in the proband. A neuronally-expressed solute carrier for glutamine (Sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 (SNAT1), also known as solute carrier family 38, member 1 (SLC38A1)) was identified as severely decreased across all brain regions. Follow-up analysis by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot confirmed the reduction of SNAT1. We categorized the SNAT1 gene in human brain, cloned the gene promoter and assessed in silico the expression pattern of SNAT1 in >25 tissues from human. Complete DNA sequencing of the SNAT1 gene was performed in the family and 276 controls. The family was homozygous for rare alleles which suggests a possible association between low expression of SNAT1 and suicidal behavior.

RUNX proteins regulate the transition from proliferation to differentiation in a variety of cell lineages. Moreover, they control the diversification of distinct cellular phenotypes in numerous tissues. Alterations of RUNX functions are associated with several cancers and other human pathologies, underscoring the vital roles of these transcription factors in adult organs. Insights into the functions and regulations of mammalian RUNX proteins have been provided mostly by studies of RUNX involvement in mechanisms of hematopoietic and skeletal development and disease. A growing number of recent investigations are revealing new functions for RUNX family members during the development of the mammalian nervous system. This review will discuss recent progress in the study of RUNX protein involvement in mammalian neural development, with emphasis on the differentiation of olfactory, sensory, and motor neuron lineages.

The aims of the study were to quantify T1, T2 and PD values in all cortical gray matter regions for a group of healthy Volunteers scanned at 1.5 T and to cluster regions showing statistically distinguishable tissue characteristics. Using a combination of spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) and fast spin echo (FSE) sequences, 3D T1, T2 and PD of the brain were measured at 1.5 T for twenty healthy Young Volunteers. Cortical GM volumes of interest (VOIs) were identified by transforming 56 labels from an atlas onto each Subject volumes: 8 frontal, 5 parietal, 6 occipital and 9 temporal oil both the left and tight sides. T1, T2 and PD measurements within these anatomical regions were quantified and reported here. Correspondence analysis (CA) and hierarchical clustering (HC) were combined and applied to averaged T1, T2 and PD values within each VOI in order to identify groups of anatomical structures that are related statistically. Interestingly, except for one Structure, all VOIs were grouped with left-right symmetry and showed an interesting pattern: the four lobes (frontal, occipital, parietal and temporal) were roughly Clustered and the precentral and postcentral gyri were merged together. Our study shows that CA and HC analysis of MRI relaxation parameters and proton density can be used for cortical clustering of atlas-defined cortical regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, anatomical and indirect physiological data suggest the presence of NT receptors at the terminal level. However, a clear demonstration of the mechanism of action of NT on dopaminergic axon terminals is lacking. We hypothesize that NT acts to increase DA release by inhibiting the function of terminal D2 autoreceptors. To test this hypothesis, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCV) to monitor in real time the axonal release of DA in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Results: DA release was evoked by single electrical pulses and pulse trains (10 Hz, 30 pulses). Under these two stimulation conditions, we evaluated the characteristics of DA D-2 autoreceptors and the presynaptic action of NT in the NAcc shell and shell/core border region. The selective agonist of D-2 autoreceptors, quinpirole (1 mu M), inhibited DA overflow evoked by both single and train pulses. In sharp contrast, the selective D-2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride (5 mu M), strongly enhanced DA release triggered by pulse trains, without any effect on DA release elicited by single pulses, thus confirming previous observations. We then determined the effect of NT (8-13) (100 nM) and found that although it failed to increase DA release evoked by single pulses, it strongly enhanced DA release evoked by pulse trains that lead to prolonged DA release and engage D-2 autoreceptors. In addition, initial blockade of D-2 autoreceptors by sulpiride considerably inhibited further facilitation of DA release generated by NT (8-13). Conclusion: Taken together, these data suggest that NT enhances DA release principally by inhibiting the function of terminal D-2 autoreceptors and not by more direct mechanisms such as facilitation of terminal calcium influx.

To determine if the anti-Bax function of PrP modulates the manifestation of prion diseases, we further investigated the anti-Bax function of eight familial Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome (GSS)-associated PrP mutants. These PrP mutants contained their respective methionine ((M)) or valine ((V)) at codon 129. All of the mutants lost their ability to prevent Bax-mediated chromatin condensation or DNA fragmentation in primary human neurons. In the breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells, the F198S(V), D202N(V), P102L(V) and Q217R(V) retained, whereas the P102L(M), P105L(V), Y145stop(M) and Q212P(M) PrP mutants lost their ability to inhibit Bax-mediated condensed chromatin. The inhibition of Bax-mediated condensed chromatin depended on the ability of the mutants to generate cytosolic PrP. However, except for the P102L(V), none of the mutants significantly inhibited Bax-mediated caspase activation. These results show that the cytosolic PrP generated from the GSS mutants is not as efficient as wild type PrP in inhibiting Bax-mediated cell death. Furthermore, these results indicate that the anti-Bax function is also disrupted in GSS-associated PrP mutants and is not associated with the difference between CJD and GSS.

The Geometry of Perisaccadic Visual Perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; FOVEAL STRIATE CORTEX; BRAIN-STEM TELLS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; VISUOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MAGNIFICATION FACTOR; LOCALIZATION ERRORS; APPARENT POSITION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS	Our ability to explore our surroundings requires a combination of high-resolution vision and frequent rotations of the visual axis toward objects of interest. Such gaze shifts are themselves a source of powerful retinal stimulation, and so the visual system appears to have evolved mechanisms to maintain perceptual stability during movements of the eyes in space. The mechanisms underlying this perceptual stability can be probed in the laboratory by briefly presenting a stimulus around the time of a saccadic eye movement and asking subjects to report its position. Under such conditions, there is a systematic misperception of the probes toward the saccade end point. This perisaccadic compression of visual space has been the subject of much research, but few studies have attempted to relate it to specific brain mechanisms. Here, we show that the magnitude of perceptual compression for a wide variety of probe stimuli and saccade amplitudes is quantitatively predicted by a simple heuristic model based on the geometry of retinotopic representations in the primate brain. Specifically, we propose that perisaccadic compression is determined by the distance between the probe and saccade end point on a map that has a logarithmic representation of visual space, similar to those found in numerous cortical and subcortical visual structures. Under this assumption, the psychophysical data on perisaccadic compression can be appreciated intuitively by imagining that, around the time of a saccade, the brain confounds nearby oculomotor and sensory signals while attempting to localize the position of objects in visual space.

Chromosomal 7q34 duplication leading to fusion genes formed between KIAA1549 and BRAF and subsequent constitutive activation of BRAF was recently identified in a proportion of LGA, and may be involved in their pathogenesis. Our aim was to investigate additional chromosomal unbalances in LGA and whether incidence of 7q34 duplication is associated with tumour type or location. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Illumina-Human-Hap300-Duo and 610-Quad high-resolution-SNP-based arrays and quantitative PCR on genes of interest, we investigated 84 paediatric LGA. We demonstrate that 7q34 duplication is specific to sporadic JPA (35 of 53-66%) and does not occur in other LGA subtypes (0 of 27) or NFI-associated-JPA (0 of 4). We also establish that it is site specific as it occurs in the majority of cerebellar JPA (24 of 30-80%) followed by brainstem, hypothalamic/optic pathway JPA (10 of 16-62.5%) and is rare in hemispheric JPA (1 of 7-14%). The MAP-kinase pathway, assessed through ERK phosphorylation, was active in all tumours regardless of 7q34 duplication. Gain of function studies performed on hTERT-immortalised astrocytes show that overexpression of wild-type BRAF does not increase cell proliferation or baseline MAPK signalling even if it sensitises cells to EGFR stimulation. CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that variants of JPA might arise from a unique site-restricted progenitor cell where 7q34 duplication, a hallmark of this tumour-type in association to MAPK-kinase pathway activation, potentially plays a site-specific role in their pathogenesis. Importantly, gain of function abnormalities in components of MAP-Kinase signalling are potentially present in all JPA making this tumour amenable to therapeutic targeting of this pathway.

The phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) are involved in functional modulation of several types of ion channels. We report here evidence that these phospholipids are able to modulate the function of homomeric P2X3 and heteromeric P2X2/3 purinoceptors expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors and in heterologous expression systems. Results: In dissociated rat DRG neurons, incubation with the PI3K/PI4K inhibitor wortmannin at 35 mu M induced a dramatic decrease in the amplitude of ATP- or alpha,beta-meATP-evoked P2X3 currents, while incubation with 100 nM wortmannin (selective PI3K inhibition) produced no significant effect. Intracellular application of PIP(2) was able to fully reverse the inhibition of P2X3 currents induced by wortmannin. In Xenopus oocytes and in HEK293 cells expressing recombinant P2X3, 35 mu M wortmannin incubation induced a significant decrease in the rate of receptor recovery. Native and recombinant P2X2/3 receptor-mediated currents were inhibited by incubation with wortmannin both at 35 mu M and 100 nM. The decrease of P2X2/3 current amplitude induced by wortmannin could be partially reversed by application of PIP(2) or PIP(3), indicating a sensitivity to both phosphoinositides in DRG neurons and Xenopus oocytes. Using a lipid binding assay, we demonstrate that the C-terminus of the P2X2 subunit binds directly to PIP(2), PIP(3) and other phosphoinositides. In contrast, no direct binding was detected between the C-terminus of P2X3 subunit and phosphoinositides. Conclusion: Our findings indicate a functional regulation of homomeric P2X3 and heteromeric P2X2/3 ATP receptors by phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane of DRG nociceptors, based on subtype-specific mechanisms of direct and indirect lipid sensing.

While it seems clear that serotonergic alterations play a role in the pathogenesis of these major public health problems, dysfunction in additional neurotransmitter systems and other molecular alterations may also be implicated. Microarray expression studies are excellent screening tools to generate hypotheses about additional molecular processes that may be at play. In this study we investigated brain regions that are known to be implicated in the neurobiology of suicide and major depression are likely to represent valid global molecular alterations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed gene expression analysis using the HG-U133AB chipset in 17 cortical and subcortical brain regions from suicides with and without major depression and controls. Total mRNA for microarray analysis was obtained from 663 brain samples isolated from 39 male subjects, including 26 suicide cases and 13 controls diagnosed by means of psychological autopsies. Independent brain samples from 34 subjects and animal studies were used to control for the potential confounding effects of comorbidity with alcohol. Using a Gene Ontology analysis as our starting point, we identified molecular pathways that may be involved in depression and suicide, and performed follow-up analyses on these possible targets. Methodology included gene expression measures from microarrays, Gene Score Resampling for global ontological profiling, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We observed the highest number of suicide specific alterations in prefrontal cortical areas and hippocampus. Our results revealed alterations of synaptic neurotransmission and intracellular signaling. Among these, Glutamatergic (GLU) and GABAergic related genes were globally altered. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR results investigating expression of GLU and GABA receptor subunit genes were consistent with microarray data. Conclusions/Significance: The observed results represent the first overview of global expression changes in brains of suicide victims with and without major depression and suggest a global brain alteration of GLU and GABA receptor subunit genes in these conditions.

Here we investigate possible underlying causes for the state of cortical hyperexcitability which was recently shown to be one of the characteristics of BS. Our hypothesis was that cortical inhibition is diminished during isoflurane-induced BS. Experiments were performed in vivo using intracellular recordings of cortical neurons to assess their responsiveness to stimulations of connected thalamic nuclei. We demonstrate that during BS EPSPs were diminished by 44%, whereas inhibitory potentials were completely suppressed. This finding was supported by additional results indicating that a decrease in neuronal input resistance normally found during inhibitory responses under low isoflurane conditions was abolished in the BS condition. Moreover, removal of inhibition occasionally revealed excitatory components which were absent during recordings before the induction of BS. We also show that the absence of inhibition during BS is not caused by a blockage of GABA receptors, since iontophoretically applied GABA shows receptor availability. Moreover, the concentration of extracellular chloride was increased during BS, as would be expected after reduced flow of chloride through GABA(A) receptors. Also inhibitory responses were reinstated by selective blockage of glial glutamate transporters with dihydrokainate. These results suggest that the lack of inhibition during BS is caused by reduced excitation, probably resulting from increased glial uptake of glutamate stimulated by isoflurane, which creates a diminished activation of cortical interneurons. Thus cortical hyperexcitability during BS is favored by suppressed inhibition.

Possible common central pathway for resistin and insulin in regulating food intake	ACTA PHYSIOLOGICA			English	Article						adipocyte-derived peptides; food intake; insulin; neuropeptide Y; resistin	NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; TRANSIENT TRANSFECTION; GLUCOSE-PRODUCTION; EXPRESSION; RATS; INHIBITION; CELLS	Aim: Adipose tissue has been the object of intense research in the field of obesity and diabetes diseases in the last decade. Examination of adipocyte-secreted peptides led to the identification of a unique polypeptide, resistin (RSTN), which has been suggested as a link between obesity and diabetes. RSTN plays a clearly documented role in blocking insulin (INS)-induced hypoglycaemia. As brain injection of INS affects feeding behaviour, we studied the possible interaction between INS and RSTN in food-deprived rats, measuring effects on food intake. In addition, we examined how RSTN might affect neuropeptide Y (NPY)-induced feeding, as studies have shown that rat RSTN can interfere with the NPY system. Methods: Overnight food-deprived rats were injected into the third brain ventricle (3V) with either INS (10 or 20 mUI), RSTN (0.1-0.4 nmol/rat), or saline before access to food. Another group of rats was injected into the 3V with RSTN alone, NPY alone or RSTN plus NPY. Their food intake and body weight were measured. Results: Our results confirm the hypophagic effect of RSTN on food deprivation-induced food intake, and more importantly, show that RSTN neither potentiates nor blocks the effects of INS on food intake, but does reduce the hyperphagic effect of NPY. Conclusion: The observation that RSTN does not modify feeding INS-induced hypophagia, but does influence NPY-induced feeding, points to the possibility that RSTN may be involved in control of food intake through an NPY-ergic mechanism as INS.

First published June 10, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.90821.2008.-Populations of intrathoracic extracardiac neurons transduce myocardial ischemia, thereby contributing to sympathetic control of regional cardiac indices during such pathology. Our objective was to determine whether electrical neuromodulation using spinal cord stimulation (SCS) modulates such local reflex control. In 10 anesthetized canines, middle cervical ganglion neurons were identified that transduce the ventricular milieu. Their capacity to transduce a global (rapid ventricular pacing) vs. regional (transient regional ischemia) ventricular stress was tested before and during SCS (50 Hz, 0.2 ms duration at 90% MT) applied to the dorsal aspect of the T1 to T4 spinal cord. Rapid ventricular pacing and transient myocardial ischemia both activated cardiac-related middle cervical ganglion neurons. SCS obtunded their capacity to reflexly respond to the regional ventricular ischemia, but not rapid ventricular pacing. In conclusion, spinal cord inputs to the intrathoracic extracardiac nervous system obtund the latter's capacity to transduce regional ventricular ischemia, but not global cardiac stress. Given the substantial body of literature indicating the adverse consequences of excessive adrenergic neuronal excitation on cardiac function, these data delineate the intrathoracic extracardiac nervous system as a potential target for neuromodulation therapy in minimizing such effects.

No study has examined the development of cortical asymmetry using longitudinal neuroanatomical data. Objective: To delineate the development of cortical asymmetry in children with and without ADHD. Design: Longitudinal study. Setting: Government Clinical Research Institute. Participants: A total of 218 children with ADHD and 358 typically developing children, from whom 1133 neuroanatomical magnetic resonance images were acquired prospectively. Main Outcome Measures: Cortical thickness was estimated at 40 962 homologous points in the left and right hemispheres, and the trajectory of change in asymmetry was defined using mixed-model regression. Results: In right-handed typically developing individuals, a mean (SE) increase in the relative thickness of the right orbitofrontal and inferior frontal cortex with age of 0.011 (0.0018) mm per year (t(337)=6.2, P < .001) was balanced against a relative left-hemispheric increase in the occipital cortical regions of 0.013 (0.0015) mm per year (t(337)=8.1, P < .001). Age-related change in asymmetry in non-right-handed typically developing individuals was less extensive and was localized to different cortical regions. In ADHD, the posterior component of this evolving asymmetry was intact, but the prefrontal component was lost. Conclusions: These findings explain the way that, in typical development, the increased dimensions of the right frontal and left occipital cortical regions emerge in adulthood from the reversed pattern of childhood cortical asymmetries. Loss of the prefrontal component of this evolving asymmetry in ADHD is compatible with disruption of prefrontal function in the disorder and demonstrates the way that disruption of typical processes of asymmetry can inform our understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders.

The grafting reactions were optimized to generate a dense and homogeneous EGF layer. Impact of EGF orientation on A-431 cellular response was investigated. Our results demonstrate that, in sharp contrast to responses obtained with soluble EGF supply or with randomly grafted EGF, oriented immobilization of EGF via a de novo designed coiled-coil capture system leads to a sustained phosphorylation of A-431 cell surface EGF receptors. Our results thus indicate that oriented protein immobilization via coiled-coil interactions is an efficient: and versatile method to control tethering of bioactive molecules for future applications in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.

Intracarotid Amobarbital Procedure and Etomidate Speech and Memory Test	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	30th Canadian League Against Epilepsy Meeting	OCT, 2007	Vancouver, CANADA				ESAM	The intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) has for over 50 years been an important component of the presurgical investigation of patients with epilepsy who are candidates for surgical intervention as treatment for their seizures. Owing to increasing frequency and duration of amobarbital shortages, alternatives for this drug have been sought and implemented, but until now only the drug was changed, while the basic procedure remained essentially the same as that used with amobarbital. This paper describes the Montreal Neurological Institute experience using etomidate in place of amobarbital and introducing a significant change in the procedure: after an initial bolus injection, an infusion is used to maintain the level of hemianesthesia during critical test times. Results of 28 patients tested with this procedure are compared to results from 40 patients tested in the standard IAP.

Method: Relevant literature on this problem was selectively reviewed. Results: Thus far, neuroscience research has contributed more to the understanding of the brain than to determining the causes of mental disorders. Its model is more appropriate to severe than to common mental disorders. A reductionistic approach cannot account for emergent phenomena occurring at the level of the mind.

A total of 548 incident cases and 760 healthy controls recruited between 1980 and 2002 from two Canadian provinces (Qu,bec and Ontario) were included in this study, and their mothers were interviewed. Quantitative occupational ELF-MF exposure in microTesla units was estimated using individual exposure estimations or a job exposure matrix. We used three metrics to analyze exposure: cumulative, average, and maximum level attained. Using the average exposure metric measured before conception, an increased risk was observed for astroglial tumors (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.4). During the entire pregnancy period, a significantly increased risk was observed for astroglial tumors as well as for all childhood brain tumors with the average metric (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.5 and OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.2, respectively). Based on job titles, a twofold risk increase was observed for astroglial tumors (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 0.8-6.3) and for all childhood brain tumors (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.0-5.4) among sewing machine operators. Results are suggestive of a possible association between maternal occupational ELF-MF exposure and certain brain tumors in their offspring.

We implemented a procedure to establish the duration for which a stable measurement of rate of HFOs is achieved. Methods: To determine concordance, Kappa coefficient was computed. The information gained when increasing the duration was analyzed in terms of HFO rates and ranking of channels with respect to HFO and spike rates. Results: In a group of 30 patients, Kappa was 0.7 for ripples, 0.7 for fast ripples and 0.67 for spikes. Five minutes provided the same information as 10 min in terms of rates in 9/10 patients and with respect to ranking of channels in 8/10 patients; 5/30 patients did not achieve stable measurements of HFOs or spikes and needed marking for 10 min. Conclusion: We propose that 5 min provides in most cases the same information as a longer interval when identifying HFOs and spikes in slow wave sleep, and present methods to identify when this is not the case. Significance: This procedure is useful to control for consistency between readers and to evaluate if the selected interval provides stable information, for automatic and visual identification of events.

It has also been shown that regardless of their initial site of action many drugs of abuse, such as morphine, nicotine, cocaine, alcohol and amphetamines, induce ail increase in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens This, increased secretion of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens seems to be a common effect of many drugs of-abuse, and it was proposed that may mediate their rewarding and reinforcing properties Furthermore, activation of mu opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area, or of mu and delta opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens enhances the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens Thus, stimulation of the activity of distinct components of the endogenous opioid system either by opioid or by other drugs of abuse, may mediate some of their reinforcing effects fit this review article, a brief description of the endogenous opioid system and its implication in the processes of reward and reinforcement of opioid and other drugs of abuse will be presented Furthermore, the use of opioid antagonists in the treatment of drug addiction will be discussed. Special emphasis will be given to ethanol addiction, the drug mainly studied in my laboratory.

In rats, the extent of HFOs (>200 Hz) is correlated with seizure frequency. We studied whether the same applies to patients with focal epilepsy. Thirty-nine patients with intracerebral EEG sampled at 2000 Hz were studied for interictal ripples (80-250 Hz), fast ripples (FR, 250-500 Hz) and spikes. Seizure frequency before implantation was compared to numbers of channels with HFOs (>1 /min). Analyses were repeated for HFO rates of >5, >10 and >20. Separate analyses were done for 25 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy only and for a selection of similar unilateral temporal channels in 12 patients. No linear correlation or trend was found relating the number of channels with HFOs and seizure frequency. There was a linear positive correlation between the number of channels with more than 20 FRs/min and seizure frequency. The hypothesis that the more tissue generating HFOs, the higher the seizure frequency, was not confirmed, though there might be a correlation for high FR rates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which tactile roughness perception resembles tactile speed with respect to its dependence and/or independence of the spatial properties of raised-dot surfaces. Subjects scaled the roughness of surfaces displaced under the finger. Dot spacing (centre-to-centre) ranged from 1.5 to 8.5 mm in the direction of the scan (longitudinal). Mean dot density varied from 2.2 to 46.2 dots/cm(2). Dot disposition was varied: repeating rows (periodic) or quasi-random (non-periodic). In the first experiment (n = 8), the periodic and non-periodic surfaces were matched for mean dot density. Roughness showed a monotonic increase with 1/dot density, but non-periodic surfaces were judged to be smoother than the periodic surfaces. Subjective equality was obtained when the data were re-expressed relative to longitudinal SP. In the second experiment (n = 7), the periodic and non-periodic surfaces were matched for longitudinal dot spacing. Perceptual equivalence was observed when the results were plotted relative to dot spacing, but not 1/dot density. Dot spacing in the orthogonal direction (transverse) was excluded as a contributing factor. Thus, as found for tactile speed scaling, roughness is critically dependent on longitudinal dot spacing, but independent of dot disposition and dot density (over much of the tested range). These results provide a set of predictions to identify cortical neurones that play critical roles in roughness appreciation.	[Chapman, C.

The mechanisms underlying tolerance are not well understood. We previously suggested a possible role for spinal calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP) in the development of tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia. In the present study, we demonstrate that CGRP is involved in morphine tolerance by differentially regulating the ERK-dependent up-regulation of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) in astrocytes and p38-dependent up-regulation of IL-6 in microglia in the rat spinal cord. A 7-d treatment with morphine induced tolerance to the antinociceptive effect and increased phosphorylated ERK localized in astrocytes and phosphorylated p38 enriched in microglia, both effects being inhibited by blocking CGRP receptors. Interestingly, the inhibition of the ERK pathway suppressed the development of tolerance and morphine-induced up-regulation of IL1 beta, TNF-alpha, and mPGES-1. Blockade of p38 activity also inhibited the development of tolerance and morphine-induced IL-6 up-regulation. Taken together, these data suggest that chronic morphine induces the synthesis of CGRP, which in turn acts on CGRP receptors located on astrocytes and microglia to stimulate ERK and p38, respectively, leading to increased synthesis and release of proinflammatory mediators resulting in tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia.-Wang, Z., Ma, W., Chabot, J.-G., Quirion, R.

J	Barbosa-Vargas, E; Pfaus, JG; Woodside, B				Barbosa-Vargas, Erica; Pfaus, James G.; Woodside, Barbara			Sexual behavior in lactating rats: Role of estrogen-induced progesterone receptors	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Estrogen receptor; Progesterone receptor; Lordosis; Solicitation; RU 486; Lactation; Food restriction	FEMALE RATS; FOOD RESTRICTION; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; NEURAL ESTROGEN; CORPUS-LUTEUM; INHIBITION; ESTRADIOL; PREGNANCY; IMPLANTS; DIESTRUS	Lactation is associated with suppression of reproductive function, the duration of which depends on the number of young suckled and food availability. Although previous studies have documented increasing responsivity to the positive feedback effects of estrogen on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion with time postpartum, changes in the ability of estrogen to stimulate sexual behavior across these time points and the influence of food restriction on response to estrogen have not been investigated. Thus, we compared the ability of exogenous estrogen administration to stimulate proceptive and receptive behavior in ad libitum fed and food restricted rats on Days 15 and 20 postpartum. Because the ability of estrogen to induce sexual behavior depends on activation of both estrogen receptors and estrogen-induced progesterone receptors, a second study compared estrogen and progesterone-it within the VMH and MPOA in similar groups. Finally, we investigated the role of the high levels of progesterone typical of lactation in the suppression of estrogen-induced sexual behavior by transient blockade of the progesterone receptor using RU486. As expected there was an increase across time in the ability of estrogen to stimulate sexual behavior that correlated with an increased ability of estrogen to induce progesterone receptors in the MPOA that was most evident in ad libitum fed rats. RU486 administration concomitant with estrogen administration increased solicitation behavior and was most effective in ad libitum fed rats suggesting an inhibitory role of progesterone on estrogen-induced sexual proceptivity in lactating rats.

Random Fields-Union Intersection Tests for Detecting Functional Connectivity in EEG/MEG Imaging	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						connectivity; random fields; union-intersection	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL SYSTEMS; BRAIN; FMRI; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; MODEL	Electrophysiological (EEG/MEG) imaging challenges statistics by providing two views of the same underlying spatio-temporal brain activity: a topographic view (EEG/MEG) and tomographic view (EEG/MEG source reconstructions). It is a common practice that statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for these two Situations is developed separately. In particular, assessing statistical Significance of functional connectivity is a major challenge in these types Of Studies. This work introduces statistical tests for assessing simultaneously the significance of spatio-temporal correlation Structure between ERP/ERF components as well as that Of their generating Sources. We introduce a greatest root statistic as the multivariate test statistic for detecting functional connectivity between two sets of EEG/MFG measurements at a given time instant. We use some new results in random field theory to solve the multiple comparisons problem resulting from the correlated test statistics at each time instant. In general, our approach using the Union-intersection (UI) principle provides a framework for hypothesis testing about my linear combination of sensor data, which allows the analysis of the correlation structure of both topographic and tomographic views. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated with real ERP data obtained from a face recognition experiment. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2477-2486, 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Whereas isolating and studying kill recognition mechanisms in humans using auditory and visual stimuli is problematic because of the high degree of conscious recognition of the individual involved, kill recognition based oil body odors is done predominantly without conscious recognition. Using this, we mapped the neural substrates Of human kill recognition by acquiring measures Of regional cerebral blood flow from women smelling the body odors of either their sister or their same-sex friend. The initial behavioral experiment demonstrated that accurate identification of kill is performed with a low conscious recognition, The subsequent neuroimaging experiment demonstrated that Olfactory based kill recognition in women recruited the frontal-temporal junction, the insula, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; the latter area is implicated in the coding of self-referent processing and kill recognition. We further Show that file neuronal response is seemingly independent Of conscious identification of the individual source, demonstrating that humans have all odor based kill detection system akin to what has been shown for other mammals.

Connectionist Models of Reinforcement, Imitation, and Instruction in Learning to Solve Complex Problems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTONOMOUS MENTAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Cognitive science; learning systems; neural networks; problem-solving		We compared computational models and human performance on learning to solve a high-level, planning-intensive problem. Humans and models were subjected to three learning regimes: reinforcement, imitation, and instruction. We modeled learning by reinforcement (rewards) using SARSA, a softmax selection criterion and a neural network function approximator; learning by imitation using supervised learning in a neural network; and learning by instructions using a knowledge-based neural network. We had previously found that human participants who were told if their answers were correct or not (a reinforcement group) were less accurate than participants who watched demonstrations of successful solutions of the task (an imitation group) and participants who read instructions explaining how to solve the task. Furthermore, we had found that humans who learn by imitation and instructions performed more complex solution steps than those trained by reinforcement. Our models reproduced this pattern of results.

A new type of neural network, the Quantron, generates a complicated wave function whose global maximum value is crucial for classifying patterns. To obtain an analytical approximation of this maximum, we present a multiscale scheme based on compactly supported inverted parabolas. Motivated by the Quantron's architecture as well as Laplace's method, this scheme stems from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) developed in the theory of wavelets. This approximation method will be performed, first, one scale at a time and, second, as a global approach. Convergence will be proved and results analyzed.

In this paper, we show that by introducing an asymmetry parameter into a recently introduced chaotic BAM output function, prior knowledge can be used to momentarily disable desired attractors from memory, hence biasing the search space to improve recall performance. This property allows control of chaotic wandering, favoring given subspaces over others. In addition, reinforcement learning can then enable a dual BAM architecture to store and recall nonlinearly separable patterns. Our results allow the same BAM framework to model three different types of learning: supervised, reinforcement, and unsupervised. This ability is very promising from the cognitive modeling viewpoint. The new BAM model is also useful from an engineering perspective; our simulations results reveal a notable overall increase in BAM learning and recall performances when using a hybrid model with the general regression neural network (GRNN).

The proposed detector can achieve accurate automatic discrimination of action potential (APs) from the background activity by means of an energy-based preprocessor and a linear delay element. This strategy improves detected waveforms integrity and prompts for better performance in neural prostheses. The delay element is implemented with a low-power continuous-time filter using a ninth-order equiripple allpass transfer function. All circuit building blocks use subthreshold OTAs employing dedicated circuit techniques for achieving ultra low-power and high dynamic range. The proposed circuit function in the submicrowatt range as the implemented CMOS 0.18-mu m chip dissipates 780 nW, and it features a size of 0.07 mm(2). So it is suitable for massive integration in a multichannel device with modest overhead. The fabricated detector succeeds to automatically detect APs from underlying background activity. Testbench validation results obtained with synthetic neural waveforms are presented.

The technical challenge is to automatically modulate neurostimulation parameters, as a function of the observed EEG signal, so as to minimize the frequency and duration of seizures. The methodology leverages recent techniques from the machine learning literature, in particular the reinforcement learning paradigm, to formalize this optimization problem. We present an algorithm which is able to automatically learn an adaptive neurostimulation strategy directly from labeled training data acquired from animal brain tissues. Our results suggest that this methodology can be used to automatically find a stimulation strategy which effectively reduces the incidence of seizures, while also minimizing the amount of stimulation applied. This work highlights the crucial role that modern machine learning techniques can play in the optimization of treatment strategies for patients with chronic disorders such as epilepsy.

It consists of the identification of simple stimuli which are masked within a complex configuration according to their exact size, dimension, direction, spatial orientation, and shape within a limited span of time. This test has been successfully applied in clinical settings for the assessment of cognitive abilities and disorders in young and elderly populations. This investigation aimed to examine the neural correlates of analytical-specific visual perceptual processes as measured by the Mangina-Test. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was recorded during the administration of a computer-adapted version of the Mangina-Test in twelve young healthy adults. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to estimate the overall brain activation during task accomplishment. In addition, the fMRI response area was correlated with task difficulty, in order to explore the spatial distribution of brain regions modulated by increasing task demand. Results indicate that a widely distributed bilateral network of brain regions, including the ventral and dorsal occipital cortex, parietal lobule, frontal and supplementary eye field, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and supplementary motor area, was significantly activated during test performance. Moreover, increasing difficulty significantly enhanced the neural response of ventral and dorsal occipital regions, frontal eye field. and superior parietal sulcus bilaterally, as well as the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Conversely, neural activity in the left temporo-parietal junction, inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral middle-superior temporal cortex was inversely correlated with task difficulty. Results also indicate that performance in the Mangina-Test requires an optimal integration between the enhancement of activity in specific task-related cortical areas and suppression of interfering noise from unrelated brain regions.

Perceptual analysis of stimuli dealing with the exact discrimination of size and dimension is related more to mathematical abilities (MATH), while perceptual analysis of direction and spatial orientation is related more to abilities in reading and reading comprehension (READ). Some stimuli are MIXED since they deal with both of the above features combined. We previously determined the distributed neuronal network of analytical-specific visual perceptual processes as measured by the Mangina-Test. Here, we aim at further assessing as to how brain activity is differentially modulated by the discrimination of very subtle category-specific perceptual relationships. Brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 young healthy subjects while they performed a computer-adapted version of the Mangina-Test. Behavioral results of the present study indicate that performance was not different among stimulus categories. However, brain functional data show that analytical-specific perceptual processes for MATH, READ and MIXED stimuli rely on partially distinct brain circuits. Bilateral posterior parietal, premotor and prefrontal regions along with the anterior cingulate appeared to be more activated by MATH stimuli, while READ stimuli predominantly activated bilateral medial occipito-temporal, amygdala/parahippocampal and sensorimotor cortices, and the right inferior frontal cortex. Moreover, the posterior parahippocampal cortex showed a higher activity specifically for MIXED stimuli. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that in the Mangina-Test, the exact discrimination of very subtle perceptual relationships between geometrical stimuli distinctly modulates cerebral activity, so that category-specific brain responses can be related to identifiable cognitive abilities.

Excessive compensatory recruitment as a compulsory neurophysiological mechanism in Very Early Alzheimer's Disease as compared to Mild Vascular Dementia and to age-matched normal controls	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th World Congress of Psychophysiology the Olympics of the Brain	SEP 08-13, 2008	St Petersburg, RUSSIA	Int Org Psychophysiol		Very Early Alzheimer's Disease; Mild Vascular Dementia; Age-matched normal controls; Topographic mapping of ERPs; Memory Workload Paradigm; Excessive compensatory recruitment	PERCEPTION MANGINA-TEST; MEMORY DISORDERS; CLINICAL PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY; COGNITIVE DECLINE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORKLOAD; SYSTEMS; PATHOGENESIS; CIRCUITS; MARKERS	This paper supports the theoretical position of the existence of neurophysiological mechanisms of excessive compensatory recruitment of neuronal pools in Very Early Alzheimer's Disease (VEAD) as compared to patients with Mild Vascular Dementia (MVD) and age-matched normal controls. In addition, considering that the very early recognition of Alzheimer's disease is of paramount importance for diagnosis, treatment and clinical follow-up, in the present investigation, we have used Topographic Mapping of ERPs to our Memory Workload Paradigm to delineate excessive compensatory recruitment as a sensitive neurophysiological marker for the accurate detection of VEAD as compared to MVD and to age-matched normal controls. The present findings with the Topographic Mapping of ERPs indicate that VEAD patients displayed significantly larger amplitudes with memory loads as compared to MVD patients (p = 0.0001) and to age-matched normal controls (p = 0.0001). VEAD patients displayed abnormally high P450 amplitudes (p = 0.0001) and shorter P450 latencies (p = 0.0001) over parietal and occipital sites as opposed to age-matched normal controls. In addition, contrary to normal controls, VEAD patients exhibited longer latencies over pre-frontal and frontal regions (p = 0.0001). On the other hand, P450 latencies for VEAD and MVD patients were not significantly different over anterior and posterior regions (p>0.05). These findings suggest that the delayed P450 latencies found over pre-frontal and frontal regions in both patient populations, reflect the partial disconnection of their neuronal pathways from limbic structures. Specifically, in VEAD patients, this aspect, along with the abnormally high amplitudes found over parietal and occipital regions, support the conclusion that VEAD patients allocate much more cerebral physiological resources and effort to accomplish the memory workload tasks as opposed to age-matched normal controls and to MVD patients. As such, in VEAD, the excessive recruitment of compensatory neuronal pools becomes a compulsory neurophysiological mechanism to meet the demanding tasks of our Memory Workload Paradigm.

For this purpose, Topographic Mapping of Event-Related Brain Potentials (ERPs) to a Memory Workload Paradigm with visually presented words, Bilateral Electrodermal Activity during cognitive workload and Mangina-Test performance were used. The analysis of Topographic distribution of amplitudes revealed that normal preadolescents were significantly different from "Pure" ADHD (P<0.0001), "Pure" learning disabilities (P<0.0001), and comorbid ADHD with learning disabilities (P<0.0009), by displaying enhanced prefrontal and frontal negativities (N450). In contrast, preadolescents with "Pure" ADHD and comorbid ADHD with learning disabilities have shown a marked reduction of prefrontal and frontal negativities (N450). As for the "Pure" Learning Disabled preadolescents. very small positivities (P450) in prefrontal and frontal regions were obtained as compared to the other pathological groups. Bilateral Electrodermal Activity during cognitive workload revealed a significant main effect for groups (P<0.00001), Left versus Right (P=0.0029) and sessions (P=0.0136). A significant main effect for the Mangina-Test performance which separated the four groups was found (P<0.000001). Overall, these data support the existence of clear differences and similarities between the pathological preadolescent groups as opposed to age-matched normal controls. The psychophysiological differentiation of these groups, provides distinct biological markers which integrate central, autonomic and neuropsychometric variables by targeting the key features of these pathologies for diagnosis and intervention strategies and by providing knowledge for the understanding of normal neurocognitive processes and functions.

In the setting of diabetes, impaired wound healing represents a typical pathological feature. These findings provided the impetus to test the hypothesis that experimental diabetes adversely influenced the phenotype of cardiac neural stem cells. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were associated with elevated plasma glucose levels, significant loss of body weight and left ventricular contractile dysfunction. In the heart of STZ-diabetic rats, the density of nestin immunoreactive processes emanating from cardiac neural stem cells were reduced. The latter finding was reaffirmed as nestin protein expression was significantly decreased in the heart of STZ-diabetic rats and associated with a concomitant reduction of nestin mRNA. Employing the TUNEL assay, the loss of nestin expression in STZ-diabetic rats was not attributed to widespread cardiac neural stem cell apoptosis. Insulin administration to STZ-diabetic rats with established hyperglycaemia led to a modest recovery of nestin protein expression in cardiac neural stem cells. By contrast, the administration of insulin immediately after STZ injection improved plasma glucose levels and significantly attenuated the loss of nestin protein expression. These data highlight the novel observation that nestin protein expression in cardiac neural stem cells was significantly reduced in STZ-induced type I diabetic rats. The aberrant cardiac neural stem cell phenotype may compromise their biological role and predispose the diabetic heart to maladaptive healing following ischemic injury. J. Cell.

These amines are metabolites of ornithine and are metabolically interconvertible in mammals. The method was developed to support an ongoing epidemiological study correlating these amines with the frequency of suicide. The isolation methodology is robust and requires less work and time than many previous methods. Analysis is by conventional electron ionization GC-MS with selected ion monitoring using a stable isotope-labeled analog for PUT and a chemical analog for SPD and SPM as internal standards. The time required for chromatographic analysis, about 20 min, is determined by the wide range of the relative volatilities of the derivatized polyamines. The method allows the quantitation of PUT down to 10 ng/g and SPD and SPM down to 100 and 1000 ng/g, respectively of wet tissue. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Altered methylation, a proposed epigenetic mechanism responsible for these changes, has been studied in non-primate species but not nonhuman primates. We tested the hypotheses that global methylation in fetal baboon demonstrates organ specificity, gestational age specificity, and changes with maternal nutritional status. Methods We measured global DNA methylation in fetuses of control fed (CTR) and nutrient restricted mothers fed 70% of controls (MNR) for brain, kidney, liver and heart at 0.5 and 0.9 gestation (G). Results We observed organ and gestation specific changes that were modified by maternal diet. Methylation in CTR fetuses was highest in frontal cortex and lowest in liver. MNR decreased methylation in 0.5G kidney and increased methylation in 0.9G kidney and frontal cortex. Conclusion These results demonstrate a potential epigenetic mechanism whereby reduced maternal nutrition has long-term programming effects on fetal organ development.	[Cox, L.

The objective of this study was to evaluate how glucose concentration may modulate drug effects on ventricular repolarization and on cardiac repolarizing potassium currents. Guinea pig hearts were Langendorff-retroperfused and monophasic action potential duration (MAPD) was measured. Glucose (1, 5 or 20 mmol/L) was tested with either dofetilide (a specific I-Kr blocker), chromanol 293B (a specific I-Ks blocker) or both. Effects of glucose (1, 5 or 20 mmol/L) on I-Kr blockade mediated by dofetilide were also measured in HERG-transfected HEK293 cells in the absence vs presence of the P-glycoprotein drug transporter, using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Our results suggest that both hypo- and hyperglycemia potentiate the MAPD-prolonging and I-Kr-blocking properties of dofetilide. P-glycoprotein drug extrusion efficacy appears as a key determinant of dofetilide's I-Kr-blocking effect This efficacy appears to be affected by glucose concentration, particularly hyperglycemia.

Brain endothelial cells (BECs) that primarily constitute the BBB are tightly interconnected by multiprotein complexes, the adherens junctions and the tight junctions, thereby creating a highly restrictive cellular barrier. Lipid-enriched membrane microdomain compartmentalization is an inherent property of BECs and allows for the apicobasal polarity of brain endothelium, temporal and spatial coordination of cell signaling events, and actin remodeling. In this manuscript, we review the role of membrane microdomains, in particular lipid rafts, in the BBB under physiological conditions and during leukocyte transmigration/diapedesis. Furthermore, we propose a classification of endothelial membrane microdomains based on their function, or at least on the function ascribed to the molecules included in such heterogeneous rafts: (1) rafts associated with interendothelial junctions and adhesion of BECs to basal lamina (scaffolding rafts); (2) rafts involved in immune cell adhesion and migration across brain endothelium (adhesion rafts); (3) rafts associated with transendothelial transport of nutrients and ions (transporter rafts).

This study reviewed the incidence, characteristics, therapy, and outcome of children less than 36 months of age diagnosed with medulloblastoma from 1990 to 2005 in Canada. Ninety-six cases were identified with a median age at diagnosis of 19.5 months. Forty-seven percent of patients had a complete resection, 25% a 90-95% near complete resection, 20% an incomplete (10-90%) resection, and 3% biopsy only. Therapy consisted of chemotherapy (90%), high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue (13%), and radiation therapy (21%). The median survival time was 45 +/- A 13.82 months. There was no significant difference in survival when comparing patients with < 90% resection versus > 90% resection, nor when comparing the presence of metastases versus their absence. There was a significant increase in survival time in patients who received radiation therapy compared to those who were not treated with this modality, as well as for those who were over 18 months at diagnosis compared to those under 18 months.

Brain sterol dysregulation in sporadic AD and MCI: relationship to heme oxygenase-1	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; cholesterol; cholesterol precursors; heme oxygenase-1; lipids; multivariable analysis; oxysterols; Religious Orders Study	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CHOLESTEROL-SYNTHESIS; OLDER PERSONS; RISK-FACTORS; IN-VIVO; OXYSTEROLS; EXPRESSION	The objective of this study was to ascertain the impact of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on brain cholesterol (CH), CH precursors, and oxysterol homeostasis. Altered CH metabolism and up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) are characteristic of AD-affected neural tissues. We recently determined that HO-1 over-expression suppresses total CH levels by augmenting liver X receptor-mediated CH efflux and enhances oxysterol formation in cultured astroglia. Lipids and proteins were extracted from postmortem human frontal cortex derived from subjects with sporadic AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and no cognitive impairment (n = 17 per group) enrolled in the Religious Orders Study, an ongoing clinical-pathologic study of aging and AD. ELISA was used to quantify human HO-1 protein expression from brain tissue and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify total CH, CH precursors, and relevant oxysterols. The relationships of sterol/oxysterol levels to HO-1 protein expression and clinical/demographic variables were determined by multivariable regression and non-parametric statistical analyses. Decreased CH, increased oxysterol and increased CH precursors concentrations in the cortex correlated significantly with HO-1 levels in MCI and AD, but not no cognitive impairment. Specific oxysterols correlated with disease state, increasing neuropathological burden, neuropsychological impairment, and age. A model featuring compensated and de-compensated states of altered sterol homeostasis in MCI and AD is presented based on the current data set and our earlier in vitro work.

Here, we present evidence of diminished conversion of proNGF to itsmature from and of greater NGF degradation in Alzheimer disease (AD) brain samples compared with controls. These alterations of the NGF metabolic pathway likely resulted in the increased proNGF levels. The pro-NGF was largely in a peroxynitrited form in the AD samples. Intrahippocampal injection of amyloid-beta oligomers provoked similar upregulation of pro-NGF in naive rats that was accompanied by evidence of microglial activation (CD40), increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and increased activity of the NGF-degrading enzyme matrix metalloproteinase 9. The elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase provoked the generation of biologically inactive, peroxynitrite-modified pro-NGF in amyloid-beta oligomer-injected rats. These parameters were corrected by minocycline treatment. Minocycline also diminished altered matrix metalloproteinase 9, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and microglial activation (CD40); improved cognitive behavior; and normalized pro-NGF levels ill a transgenic mouse AD model. The effects of amyloid-beta amyloid CNS burden oil NGF metabolism may explain the paradoxical upregulation of pro-NGF in AD accompanied by atrophy of forebrain cholinergic neurons.

Parietal Reach Region Encodes Reach Depth Using Retinal Disparity and Vergence Angle Signals	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							ASSOCIATION CORTEX; FIXATION-DISTANCE; VIEWING DISTANCE; MOTOR CORTEX; EYE-MOVEMENT; OPTIC ATAXIA; IN-DEPTH; NEURONS; MONKEY; HAND	Bhattacharyya R, Mussalam S, Andersen RA. Parietal reach region encodes reach depth using retinal disparity and vergence angle signals. J Neurophysiol 102: 805-816, 2009. First published May 13, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.90359.2008. Performing a visually guided reach requires the ability to perceive the egocentric distance of a target in three-dimensional space. Previous studies have shown that the parietal reach region (PRR) encodes the two-dimensional location of fronto-parallel targets in an eye-centered reference frame. To investigate how a reach target is represented in three dimensions, we recorded the spiking activity of PRR neurons from two rhesus macaques trained to fixate and perform memory reaches to targets at different depths. Reach and fixation targets were configured to explore whether neural activity directly reflects egocentric distance as the amplitude of the required motor command, which is the absolute depth of the target, or rather the relative depth of the target with reference to fixation depth. We show that planning activity in PRR represents the depth of the reach target as a function of disparity and fixation depth, the spatial parameters important for encoding the depth of a reach goal in an eye centered reference frame. The strength of modulation by disparity is maintained across fixation depth. Fixation depth gain modulates disparity tuning while preserving the location of peak tuning features in PRR neurons. The results show that individual PRR neurons code depth with respect to the fixation point, that is, in eye centered coordinates. However, because the activity is gain modulated by vergence angle, the absolute depth can be decoded from the population activity.

A motor cortical contribution to the anticipatory postural adjustments that precede reaching in the cat. J Neurophysiol 102: 853-874, 2009. First published May 20, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00042.2009. We tested the hypothesis that pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) in the motor cortex contribute to the anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) that precede the onset of a reach in the standing cat. We recorded the discharge activity of 151 PTNs in area 4 of the pericruciate cortex during reaches of both the contralateral and the ipsilateral limbs in an instructed delay task. A total of 70/151 PTNs were identified as showing an initial short-latency period of discharge following the Go signal. Linear regression analysis showed that in many of these PTNs the short-latency discharge was time-locked to the Go signal and temporally dissociated from the subsequent voluntary movement of the limb. The onset of the change in activity of most of those Go-related neurons that we could test (62/70) was temporally related to the onset of the change in the center of vertical pressure. In 33/70 PTNs, Go-related activity was observed only during contralateral reach, in 13/70 only during ipsilateral reach, and in 24/70 during movements of each limb; most of these latter cells (20/24) showed nonreciprocal changes in activity. Although 35/151 (23%) cells showed significant changes during the instructed delay period for reaches made with at least one of the limbs, only one neuron showed a significant reciprocal change during reaches with either limb. We suggest that the discharge characteristics of these PTNs are compatible with our hypothesis that the motor cortex contributes to the production of the APAs preceding movement.

First published May 27, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.91324.2008. Online control of movement requires complex integration of predictive central feedforward and peripheral sensory feedback signals. We studied the hand trajectories of human subjects pointing to visual targets that abruptly changed locations by different amounts and modeled the mechanism of rapid online correction using a dynamic model of a two-joint limb. Small unperceived and large detected target displacements could be attributed to different origins (motor execution errors vs. environmental changes, respectively) and compensated differently. However, the behavioral findings indicate that the rapid feedback pathway is recruited regardless of the amplitude or subjective awareness of target displacement and that the size of the earliest correction is always proportional to the amplitude of the target displacement over the tested range of perturbations. The modeling findings suggest that the rapid online corrections can be accomplished by superimposing a dynamically appropriate error correction signal onto the outgoing feedforward motor command to the original target. Furthermore, the modeling shows that the online correction mechanism must include compensation for the dynamic mechanical properties of the limb and for sensory delays in its error-correction pathway.

Bursts of action potentials in sensory interneurons are believed to signal the occurrence of particularly salient stimulus features. Previous work showed that bursts in an identified, ultrasound-tuned interneuron (AN2) of the cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus code for conspicuous increases in amplitude of an ultrasound stimulus, resulting in behavioral responses that are interpreted as avoidance of echolocating bats. We show that the primary sensory neurons that inform AN2 about high- frequency acoustic stimuli also produce bursts. As is the case for AN2, bursts in sensory neurons perform better as feature detectors than isolated, nonburst, spikes. Bursting is temporally correlated between sensory neurons, suggesting that on occurrence of a salient stimulus feature, AN2 will receive strong synaptic input in the form of coincident bursts, from several sensory neurons, and that this might result in bursting in AN2. Our results show that an important feature of the temporal structure of interneuron spike trains can be established at the earliest possible level of sensory processing, i.e., that of the primary sensory neuron.

The authors reviewed their institutional experience with pure low-grade oligodendroglioma (LGO), correlating outcomes with several variables of possible prognostic values. Methods. Sixty-nine patients with WHO-classified LGOs were treated between 1992 and 2006 at the McGill University Health Center. Clinical, pathological, and radiological records were carefully reviewed. Demographic characteristics; the nature and duration of presenting symptoms; baseline neurological function; extent of resection; Karnofsky Performance Scale score; preoperative radiological findings including tumor size, location, and absence/presence of enhancement; and pathological data including chromosome arms 1p/19q codeletion and O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter gene methylation status were all compiled. The timing and dose of radio- and/or chemotherapy, date of tumor progression, pathological finding at disease progression, treatment at time of disease progression, and status at the last follow-up were also recorded. Results. The median follow-up period was 6.1 years (range 1.3-16.3 years). The majority (78%) of patients presented with seizures; contrast enhancement was initially seen in 16 patients (25%). All patients had undergone an initial surgical procedure: gross-total resection in 27%, partial resection in 59%, and biopsy only in the remaining 13%. Fifteen patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. Data on O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter gene methylation status was available in 47 patients (68%) and in all but 1 patient for 1p/19q status. Survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 83, 63, and 29%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that seizures at presentation and the absence of contrast enhancement were the only independent favorable prognostic factors for survival. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year progression-free survival rates were 46, 7.7, and 0%, respectively. Conclusions. This retrospective review confirms the indolent but progressively fatal nature of LGOs. Contrast enhancement was the most evident single prognostic factor. New treatment strategies are clearly needed in the management of this disease.

The brain specimen was from a young woman who had suffered from intermittent Jacksonian seizures for 14 years and had eventually died ill status epilepticus. Aware of the pioneering removal of a tumor from the cortex reported on in 1885 by Bennett and Godlee, Osler wrote of his case, "this was an instance in which operation would have been justifiable and possibly have been the means of saving life." In 1953, a young man with Jacksonian attacks that began ill his foot underwent removal of a Grade I glioma from the central fissure. The operation was performed in in awake craniotomy during which cortical mapping was used to define the motor and sensory cortices. Treatment with focal radiation followed, and afterward the patient became seizure-free, stopped taking anticonvulsant medication, and has led an active life over the past 50 years. Reference is made to the experiences of Sherrington, Cushing, and Penfield with cortical stimulation in the awake patient under regional anesthesia as an effective aid to Surgery for epileptogenic lesions, tumors, and vascular malformations. Their technique allows for maximal resection with minimal neurological deficits. Over the past 20 years, this approach has been adopted effectively in many neurosurgical centers.

The clinical neurologic manifestations of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome arc muscular weakness, sleepiness, absence of reflexes, and dysautonomia. Neurologic manifestations are explained by the induction of an autoimmune response because of the presence of antigens that are expressed by the tumor. Neurologic paraneoplastic disorders may also be the result of toxicity of drugs, coagulopathy, infection, or metabolic diseases. We describe the case of a 13-month-old child with unusual neurologic symptoms because of the presence of an abdominal neuroblastoma. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Rats Self-Administer Intravenous Nicotine Delivered in a Novel Smoking-Relevant Procedure: Effects of Dopamine Antagonists	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							CIGARETTE-SMOKING; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; NONPHARMACOLOGICAL STIMULI; INJECTION SPEED; DRUG-TAKING; COCAINE; ACQUISITION; SCHEDULE; BEHAVIOR; EXTINCTION	Attempts to explain tobacco addiction have relied heavily on the assumption that each cigarette puff delivers a bolus of nicotine to the brain within seconds. However, nicotine transits from lungs to brain much more gradually than once thought. Nevertheless, animal self-administration studies continue to use rapid (e. g., < 3-s) infusions, as well as high unit doses of nicotine (e. g., 15-30 mu g/kg/infusion), each equivalent to one to two cigarettes. Here, we report that nicotine is self-administered across a range of infusion durations (3, 30, 60, and 120 s) in rats. Slow (30-s) infusions were preferred over fast (nominal 3-s) infusions and were self-administered across several reinforcement schedules, at doses as low as 3 mu g/kg/infusion, equivalent to one to two puffs. A conventional "fast/high" self-administration procedure (3 s-30 mu g/kg/infusion) was then compared with our new "slow/low" procedure (30 s-3 mu g/kg/infusion) in rats trained on a progressive ratio schedule and acutely challenged with dopamine receptor antagonists. The D 1 antagonist R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SCH 23390) (6-25 mu g/kg s. c.) reduced intake in both procedures and in rats self-administering cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion). The D 2 antagonists spiperone (3-30 mu g/kg s. c.) and sulpiride (5-20 mg/kg i.p.) increased intake of fast/high nicotine and cocaine, but markedly reduced intake of slow/low nicotine. In a final test, in which only infusion speed was varied, an acute spiperone challenge produced the same differential effect on nicotine self-administration. In conclusion, our new slow/low nicotine self-administration procedure, designed to better mimic smoking-associated nicotine intake, is pharmacologically distinct from the conventional fast delivery/high-dose procedure.

Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single systemic dose of kainic acid (KA; 6 mg/kg, i.p.) and local field potential activity (1-475 Hz) of the dorsal hippocampus, the amygdala and the neocortex was recorded. Of 135 ictal discharges, 55 (40.7%) involved both limbic structures. We demonstrated that 78.2% of seizures involving both the hippocampus and amygdala showed hippocampal gamma oscillations. Seizure duration was also significantly correlated with the frequency of hippocampal gamma oscillations (r(2) = 0.31, p<0.01) and LFP synchrony in the amygdalo-hippocampal network (r(2)=0.21, p<0.05). These results suggest that gamma oscillations in the amygdalo-hippocampal network could facilitate long-range synchrony and participate in the propagation of seizures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Seven days after a single N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) intraperitoneal administration in mice, we observed a decrease of NA in both the LC and DRN, as well as in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIPP). Moreover, an increase of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) was detected at LC level, while no change was found in DRN. DSP-4 also caused a significant decrease of dopamine (DA) tissue content in HIPP and DRN, without affecting the LC and the PFC. A decrease of DA metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA), was found in the DRN of NA-depleted mice. These results highlight that the neurotoxic action of DSP-4 is not restricted to LC terminal projections but also involves NA depletion at the cell body level, where it is paralleled by adaptive changes in both serotonergic and dopaminergic systems.

Nonlinear system identification using optimized dynamic neural network	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Artificial neural network; Nonlinear system identification; On-line adaptation; Genetic algorithm	GENETIC ALGORITHMS	In this paper, both off-line architecture optimization and on-line adaptation have been developed for a dynamic neural network (DNN) in nonlinear system identification. In the off-line architecture optimization, a new effective encoding scheme-Direct Matrix Mapping Encoding (DMME) method is proposed to represent the structure of neural network by establishing connection matrices. A series of GA operations are applied to the connection matrices to find the optimal number of neurons on each hidden layer and interconnection between two neighboring layers of DNN. The hybrid training is adopted to evolve the architecture, and to tune the weights and input delays of DNN by combining GA with the modified adaptation laws. The modified adaptation laws are subsequently used to tune the input time delays, weights and linear parameters in the optimized DNN-based model in on-line nonlinear system identification. The effectiveness of the architecture optimization and adaptation is extensively tested by means of two nonlinear system identification examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Xie, W.

Variance decomposition of MRI-based covariance maps using genetically informative samples and structural equation modeling	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; CORTICAL THICKNESS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VAL66MET POLYMORPHISM; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MULTIVARIATE; NETWORKS; ADOLESCENTS	The role of genetics in driving intracortical relationships is an important question that has rarely been Studied in humans. In particular, there are no extant high-resolution imaging studies on genetic covariance. In this article, we describe a novel method that combines classical quantitative genetic methodologies for variance decomposition with recently developed semi-multivariate algorithms for high-resolution measurement of phenotypic covariance. Using these tools, we produced correlational maps of genetic and environmental (i.e. nongenetic) relationships between several regions of interest and the cortical surface in a large pediatric sample of 600 twins, siblings, and singletons. These analyses demonstrated high, fairly uniform, statistically significant genetic correlations between the entire cortex and global mean cortical thickness. In agreement with prior reports on phenotypic covariance using similar methods, we found that mean cortical thickness was most strongly correlated with association cortices. However, the present study suggests that genetics plays a large role in global brain patterning of cortical thickness in this manner. Further. using specific gyri with known high heritabilities as seed regions, we found a consistent pattern of high bilateral genetic correlations between structural homologues, with environmental correlations more restricted to the same hemisphere as the seed region, Suggesting that interhemispheric covariance is largely genetically mediated.

The communication was designed to investigate the interaction between AVP and NA in the rat PVN during the pain process. We used the potassium iontophoresis inducing tail-flick to test the pain threshold, PVN push-pull perfusion to collect the samples, high performance chromatography (HPLC) to determine the NA concentration and radioimmunoassay (RIA) to measure the AVP concentration. The results showed that (1) pain stimulation increased both NA and AVP concentrations in the PVN perfusion liquid; (2) PVN administration Of L-glutamate sodium increased AVP, not NA concentration in the PVN perfusion liquid; (3) AVP or d(CH2)(5)Tyr(Et)DAVP (AVP-receptor antagonist) neither changed pain threshold, nor influenced NA concentration in the PVN perfusion liquid; (4) Microinjection of NA into PVN could increase pain threshold in a dose-dependent manner, while PVN administration with phentolamine (a-receptor antagonist), not propranolol (beta-receptor antagonist) decreased pain threshold; (5) Administration of NA increased AVP concentration, while phentolamine, not propranolol decreased AVP concentration in the PVN perfusion liquid. These data suggested that it is through a-receptor rather than P-receptor, NA induced PVN secretion of AVP that was delivered to the related brain regions to participate in pain modulation.

We recently showed that blind subjects outperformed the sighted in a haptic 2D-angle discrimination task. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the same blind (n = 16) and sighted (n = 17, G1) subjects in three tactile discrimination tasks dependent solely on cutaneous inputs from the fingertip of the index finger, D2. A second group of sighted subjects (n = 30, G2) were also tested. Texture discrimination thresholds were 0.62 (G1)-0.80mm (G2) for the sighted subjects, and 0.64 mm for the blind (standard, 2 mm spatial period). Grating orientation thresholds were 0.99 (G1)-1.12 mm (G2) for the sighted subjects, and 0.96 mm. for the blind. Finally, vibrotactile frequency discrimination thresholds (100 Hz standard) were 19.5 (G2) and 20.0 Hz (G1) for the sighted, and 16.5 Hz for the blind subjects. There were no significant differences in performance between the blind and the sighted subjects for the grating orientation or vibrotactile frequency discrimination tasks. In contrast, blind subjects outperformed the sighted for the texture discrimination task (G2 only), possibly reflecting the fact that the raised dot surfaces were similar to the dots forming Braille characters (all were fluent Braille readers).

Previous studies have demonstrated that the impairment is accompanied by not only regional brain abnormalities but also changes in neuronal connectivity between anatomically distinct brain regions. Specifically, using neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques as well as advanced graph theory-based computational approaches, several recent studies have suggested that AD patients have disruptive neuronal integrity in large-scale structural and functional brain Systems Underlying high-level cognition, as demonstrated by a loss of small-world network characteristics. Small world is an attractive model for the description of complex brain networks because it can Support both segregated and integrated information processing. The altered small-world organization thus reflects aberrant neuronal connectivity in the AD brain that is most likely to explain cognitive deficits caused by this disease. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in the brain network research on AD, focusing mainly on the large-scale structural and functional descriptions. I Me literature reviewed here Suggests that AD patients are associated with integrative abnormalities in the distributed neuronal networks, which could provide new insights into the disease mechanism in AD and help LIS to uncover an imaging-based biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease.

Computational genetic mapping and quantitative trait locus analysis suggested that variation within the gene coding for the beta(3) subunit of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase pump (Atp1b3) contributes to inter-strain differences in the early phase formalin pain behavior. Significant strain differences in Atp1b3 gene expression, beta(3) protein expression, and biophysical properties of the Na(+),K(+) pump in dorsal root ganglia neurons from resistant (A/J) and sensitive (C57BL/6J) mouse strains supported the genetic prediction. Furthermore, in vivo siRNA knockdown of the beta(3) subunit produced strain-specific changes in the early phase pain response, completely rescuing the strain difference. These findings indicate that the beta(3) subunit of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase is a novel determinant of nociceptive sensitivity and further supports the notion that pain variability genes can have very selective effects on individual pain modalities.

Moreover, the criteria and the usual biological markers oversee the importance of cardiac-specific markers in diagnosing this disease. We sought to study the clinical usefulness of measuring B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its N-terminal moiety (NT-proBNP) at the onset of KD. Our objective was to evaluate blood concentrations of BNP and NT-proBNP during the acute and subacute phases of KD. We conducted a prospective study comparing newly diagnosed KD patients to non-KD febrile controls. Blood specimens were collected at presentation, 6-12 h after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, 1-2 weeks later, and 2-3 months later, or only upon reenrollment for controls. Forty-there KD and 19 control patients were enrolled consecutively. The mean age was 47.1 +/- A 34.3 and 62.2 +/- A 44.9 months, respectively (p = NS). Pre-IVIG NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in KD patients than in controls (923.6 +/- A 1361.7 vs. 186.2 +/- A 198.0 ng/L; p < 0.001), with no statistical difference for BNP (141.9 +/- A 227.5 vs. 59.9 +/- A 72.4 ng/L; p = 0.112). In conclusion, our data indicate that NT-proBNP is a better marker of myocardial involvement in acute KD than BNP, particularly in cases with incomplete diagnostic criteria, and suggest that it may be a valid adjunctive diagnostic method to support the diagnosis of KD.

These fibers target alpha 2 adrenergic receptors (alpha(2)ARs) on both primary afferent terminals and secondary neurons, and their activation mediates substantial inhibitory control over this transmission, rivaling that of opioid receptors which share a similar pattern of distribution. The terminals of primary afferent nociceptive neurons and secondary spinal dorsal horn neurons express alpha(2A)AR and alpha(2C)AR subtypes, respectively. Spinal delivery of these agents serves to reduce their side effects, which are mediated largely at supraspinal sites, by concentrating the drugs at the spinal level. Targeting these spinal alpha(2)ARs with one of five selective therapeutic agonists, clonidine, dexmedetomidine, brimonidine, ST91 and moxonidine, produces significant antinociception that can work in concert with opioid agonists to yield synergistic antinociception. Application of several genetically altered mouse lines had facilitated identification of the primary receptor subtypes that likely mediate the antinociceptive effects of these agents.

Distinct Parietal and Temporal Pathways to the Homologues of Broca's Area in the Monkey	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; MNEMONIC RETRIEVAL; ASSOCIATIVE AREA-7; LANGUAGE EVOLUTION	The homologues of the two distinct architectonic areas 44 and 45 that constitute the anterior language zone ( Broca's region) in the human ventrolateral frontal lobe were recently established in the macaque monkey. Although we know that the inferior parietal lobule and the lateral temporal cortical region project to the ventrolateral frontal cortex, we do not know which of the several cortical areas found in those regions project to the homologues of Broca's region in the macaque monkey and by means of which white matter pathways. We have used the autoradiographic method, which permits the establishment of the cortical area from which axons originate (i.e., the site of injection), the precise course of the axons in the white matter, and their termination within particular cortical areas, to examine the parietal and temporal connections to area 44 and the two subdivisions of area 45 (i.e., areas 45A and 45B). The results demonstrated a ventral temporo-frontal stream of fibers that originate from various auditory, multisensory, and visual association cortical areas in the intermediate superolateral temporal region. These axons course via the extreme capsule and target most strongly area 45 with a more modest termination in area 44. By contrast, a dorsal stream of axons that originate from various cortical areas in the inferior parietal lobule and the adjacent caudal superior temporal sulcus was found to target both areas 44 and 45. These axons course in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, with some axons originating from the ventral inferior parietal lobule and the adjacent superior temporal sulcus arching and forming a simple arcuate fasciculus. The cortex of the most rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule is preferentially linked with the ventral premotor cortex (ventral area 6) that controls the orofacial musculature. The cortex of the intermediate part of the inferior parietal lobule is linked with both areas 44 and 45. These findings demonstrate the posterior parietal and temporal connections of the ventrolateral frontal areas, which, in the left hemisphere of the human brain, were adapted for various aspects of language production. These precursor circuits that are found in the nonlinguistic, nonhuman, primate brain also exist in the human brain. The possible reasons why these areas were adapted for language use in the human brain are discussed. The results throw new light on the prelinguistic precursor circuitry of Broca's region and help understand functional interactions between Broca's ventrolateral frontal region and posterior parietal and temporal association areas.

Simultaneous anhedonia and exaggerated locomotor activation in an animal model of depression	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Anhedonia; Depression; Locomotion; Amphetamine; CREB; Animal model	UNPREDICTABLE MILD STRESS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS SHELL; CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; REWARD SUMMATION FUNCTION; BRAIN-STIMULATION REWARD; OLFACTORY BULBECTOMY; VENTRAL STRIATUM; SELF-STIMULATION; SUCROSE CONSUMPTION; MIXED DEPRESSION	Anhedonia, or hyposensitivity to normally pleasurable stimuli, is a cardinal symptom of depression. As such, reward circuitry may comprise a substrate with relevance to this symptom of depression. Our aim was to characterize in the rat changes in the rewarding properties of a pharmacological and a natural stimulus following olfactory bulbectomy (OBX), a pre-clinical animal model of depression. We measured amphetamine enhancement of brain stimulation reward, changes in sucrose intake, as well as striatal cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activity, a molecular index previously associated with depressant-like behavior. Moreover, since alteration of psychomotor activity is also a common symptom of depression, and psychostimulant reward and locomotion are thought to share common neurobiology, we used the same treatment schedule of amphetamine to probe for changes in locomotion. Our findings show that OBX produces a behavioral phenotype characterized by both anhedonia and exaggerated locomotor activation. Thus, we observed a blunted response to the rewarding properties of amphetamine (1 mg/kg, 21 days post-lesion), a long-lasting reduction in sucrose intake and increased striatal CREB activity. In addition, the same dose of amphetamine, at a coincident time post-lesion, triggered an exaggerated response to its locomotor-stimulant actions. These paradoxical findings are not consistent with the notion that reward and locomotion are mediated by a common substrate; this dissociation may be useful in modeling psychiatric disorders such as mixed depressive states. In addition, our findings suggest that central reward circuitry may constitute a possible target for rationally designed therapeutics for depression.

J	Chaput, G; Giguere, JF; Chauny, JM; Denis, R; Lavigne, G				Chaput, Genevieve; Giguere, Jean-Francois; Chauny, Jean-Marc; Denis, Ronald; Lavigne, Gilles			Relationship among subjective sleep complaints, headaches, and mood alterations following a mild traumatic brain injury	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Mild traumatic brain injury; Sleep complaints; Headaches; Mood alterations; Symptoms; Risk factor; Irritability; Depression	CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; POSTCONCUSSION SYMPTOMS; RECOVERY; SCALE	Background: Sleep complaints (e.g., frequent awakenings, nightmares), headaches and mood alterations (e.g., feeling depressed, irritable) can appear following a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). The objective of this retrospective study was to assess the relationships between the above symptoms. Our hypothesis was that sleep complaints might be among the risk factors for the development of headaches and mood alterations. Methods: The consecutive charts of 443 patients (68.2% males vs. 31.8% female; mean age of 46.9 years) diagnosed with MTBI were reviewed for past medical history and above symptoms using the Rivermead post-concussion symptom assessment questionnaire and self-report. Data were retrieved in 2 time courses: 10 days and 6 weeks. Results: For the 2 time Courses, the prevalence of subjective sleep complaints were 13.3% and 33.5%; headaches 46.8% and 39.3%; feeling depressed 9.5% and 20.4%; and feeling irritable 5.6% and 20.2%, respectively. Reports of sleep complaints at 6 weeks were 2.9 times (p = 0.004) more likely if such a symptom was reported at 10 days. Moreover, the presence of sleep complaints at 10 days is associated with concomitant headaches, depressive symptoms, and feeling irritable by 2.3, 9.9, and 12.2 times (p = 0.0001 and 0.014): and by 2.9, 6.3, and 4.8 times (p = 0.0001) at 6 weeks, respectively. Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients afflicted with sleep complaints are more likely to suffer from concomitant headaches, depressive symptoms, and irritability. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Huish, R				Huish, Robert			How Cuba's Latin American School of Medicine challenges the ethics of physician migration	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Editorial Material						Cuba; Medical education; Ethics; Migration; Capacity-building; Human resources	BRAIN-DRAIN; COSMOPOLITAN JUSTICE; PROFESSIONALS; ZIMBABWE; PIPELINE; COUNTRY; AFRICA; DOCTOR; MALAWI; IMPACT	This paper demonstrates a working alternative to the accepted ethics of physician migration. A dominant cosmopolitan ethics encourages upward mobility of physicians in a globalized labour force, and this ultimately advances the position of individuals rather than improving public health-care service for vulnerable communities in the global South. Cuba's Escuela Latinoamericana de Medicina (ELAM) challenges this trend as its institutional ethics furnishes graduates with appropriate skills, knowledge and service ethics to deliver quality care in marginalized areas. This paper provides an analysis of how ELAM trains physicians in community-oriented service for marginalized areas in the global South. The principle finding of this analysis is that ELAM exhibits a working alternative to the accepted ethics of physician migration, as it encourages graduates to practice in marginalized communities rather than feed the migration pipeline into the North. Arguably, ELAM serves as an important case study in how a medical school's ethics can work to bring graduates closer to the communities that are in desperate need of their skills and of their compassion.

A high-concentration (640 mu g/cm(2)) capsaicin patch, designated NGX-4010, is in clinical evaluation for the management of peripheral neuropathic pain. To determine systemic capsaicin exposure after single 60- or 90-minute NGX-4010 applications, plasma samples were collected from 173 patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), painful human immunodeficiency virus-associated neuropathy (HIV-AN), and painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). The percentages of patients with quantifiable levels of capsaicin at any time point were 31% for PHN (30 of 96), 7% for HIV-AN (3 of 44), and 3% for PDN (1 of 33). The maximum plasma concentration observed in any patient was 17.8 ng/mL. Due to the limited number of quantifiable levels, a population analysis was performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capsaicin. Plasma concentrations were fitted adequately using a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and linear elimination. Capsaicin levels declined very rapidly, with a mean population elimination half-life of 1.64 hours. Mean area under the curve and C(max) values after a 60-minute application were 7.42 ng.h/mL and 1.86 ng/mL, respectively. Only a few correlations between calculated PK parameters and patient characteristics were observed. Duration and area of application of the patch were detected as significant covariates explaining the PK of capsaicin. Ninety-minute applications of NGX-4010 resulted in capsaicin area under the curve and C(max) values approximately 1.78- and 2.15-fold higher than those observed in patients treated for 60 minutes. Treatment on the feet (patients with HIV-AN and PDN) produced far lower systemic exposure than treatment on the trunk (patients with PHN). Finally, larger treatment areas were associated with statistically higher V(c)/F values. The low systemic exposure and very rapid elimination half-life of capsaicin after NGX-4010 administration are unlikely to result in systemic effects and support the overall safety profile of this investigational cutaneous patch.

Interestingly, large particles such as procollagen, chylomicrons and some viruses all reach the TGN by atypical routes. Given this dichotomy, we anticipated that such cargos might rely on non-classical machineries downstream of the TGN. Using Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as a model and a synchronized infection protocol that focuses on TGN to plasma membrane transport, the present study revealed the surprising implication of the cellular serine-threonine protein kinase D in HSV-1 egress. These findings, confirmed by a variety of complementary means [pharmacological inhibitors, dominant negative mutant, RNA interference and electron microscopy (EM)], identify one of possibly several cellular factors that modulate the egress of viruses transiting at the TGN. Moreover, the involvement of this kinase, previously known to regulate the transport of small basolateral cargos, highlights the trafficking of both small and exceptionally large entities by a common machinery downstream of the TGN, in sharp contrast to earlier steps of transport. Conceptually, this indicates the TGN is not only a sorting station from which cargos can depart towards different destinations but also a meeting point where conventional and unconventional routes can meet along the biosynthetic pathway. Lastly, given the apical release of HSV-1 in neurons, it opens up the possibility that this kinase might regulate some apical sorting.

Following the retrograde transport of Calcium Green dye from the limb nerves, we observed the occurrence of spontaneous calcium waves activating the motor columns of the cervical enlargement of opossums aged from P3 to P15 (day of birth: PO) and of the lumbar enlargement from at least P6 to P12. In other preparations, SR101 was added to the bath to identify the active cells. in Pi opossums, only a few SR101-labeled cells were observed in the cervical enlargement and none in the lumbar enlargement. At P5, their number increased cervically and they appeared in the lumbar enlargement. Motoneurons were the major cell type labeled by SR101 but dye leakage made their quantification inaccurate. SR101-labeled cells also occurred elsewhere in the ventral and dorsal grey. Their number increased until P12-14 in both enlargements and then decreased to disappear by P21, the last age examined. Thus in contrast to eutherian mammals, in which spontaneous activity is mostly prenatal, spontaneous activity occurs predominantly postnatally in opossums. it increases at the time when connections from the brain begin to impinge on spinal neurons and when the limbs, especially the hindlimbs, start moving and then decreases as the systems mature.

Neural transplants in patients with Huntington's disease undergo disease-like neuronal degeneration	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						excitotoxicity; inflammation; mutant huntingtin; glutamate; microglia	FETAL STRIATAL TRANSPLANTATION; LATERAL GANGLIONIC EMINENCE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PRIMATE MODEL; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; GENE-EXPRESSION; BRAIN ATROPHY; GRAFTS	The clinical evaluation of neural transplantation as a potential treatment for Huntington's disease (HD) was initiated in an attempt to replace lost neurons and improve patient outcomes. Two of 3 patients with HD reported here, who underwent neural transplantation containing striatal anlagen in the striatum a decade earlier, have demonstrated marginal and transient clinical benefits. Their brains were evaluated immunohistochemically and with electron microscopy for markers of projection neurons and interneurons, inflammatory cells, abnormal huntingtin protein, and host-derived connectivity. Surviving grafts were identified bilaterally in 2 of the subjects and displayed classic striatal projection neurons and interneurons. Genetic markers of HD were not expressed within the graft. Here we report in patients with HD that (i) graft survival is attenuated long-term; (ii) grafts undergo disease-like neuronal degeneration with a preferential loss of projection neurons in comparison to interneurons; (iii) immunologically unrelated cells degenerate more rapidly than the patient's neurons, particularly the projection neuron subtype; (iv) graft survival is attenuated in the caudate in comparison to the putamen in HD; (v) glutamatergic cortical neurons project to transplanted striatal neurons; and (vi) microglial inflammatory changes in the grafts specifically target the neuronal components of the grafts. These results, when combined, raise uncertainty about this potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of HD. However, these observations provide new opportunities to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in HD, as well as to explore additional therapeutic paradigms.

Glial ephrin-A3 regulates hippocampal dendritic spine morphology and glutamate transport	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						glial glutamate transporters; hippocampus-dependent learning; neuron-glia communication; perisynaptic glial processes	LOCALIZATION; PHARMACOLOGY; PLASTICITY; RECEPTORS; SYNAPSES; GEOMETRY; EPILEPSY; DISEASE; INJURY; BRAIN	Increasing evidence indicates the importance of neuron-glia communication for synaptic function, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We reported that the EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase is in dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons of the adult hippocampus and regulates spine morphology. We now show that the ephrin-A3 ligand, which is located in the perisynaptic processes of astrocytes, is essential for maintaining EphA4 activation and normal spine morphology in vivo. Ephrin-A3-knockout mice have spine irregularities similar to those observed in EphA4knockout mice. Remarkably, loss of ephrin-A3 or EphA4 increases the expression of glial glutamate transporters. Consistent with this, glutamate transport is elevated in ephrin-A3-null hippocampal slices whereas Eph-dependent stimulation of ephrin-A3 signaling inhibits glutamate transport. Furthermore, some forms of hippocampus-dependent learning are impaired in the ephrin-A-3knockout mice. Our results suggest that the interaction between neuronal EphA4 and glial ephrin-A3 bidirectionally controls synapse morphology and glial glutamate transport, ultimately regulating hippocampal function.

METHODS: Fifty-three patients aged <age 3 years with embryonal CNS tumor medulloblastoma (n = 20), ependymoma (EP, n = 21), choroid plexus carcinoma (CPCA, n = 5), and primitive embryonal neoplasms including atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (n = 7) were treated with cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin. Radiation therapy was used only for residual disease at the end of chemotherapy or disease progression. RESULTS: The response rate after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was 34% (complete response, 13.8%; partial response, 20.7%). Myelosuppression was the dominant toxicity; 2 patients had toxic deaths related to thrombocytopenia with trauma. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 49% +/- 7%, and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 31% +/- 7%, with a median follow-up of 11.4 years (range, 5.2-15.0 years). For medulloblastoma, the 5-year PFS was 26% +/- 9%; for EP it was 33% +/- 10%; for CPCA it was 80% +/- 18%; and for primitive neuroectodermal and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors it was 0%. Localized EP patients with gross total resection who did not undergo radiotherapy had a 5-year PFS of 57% +/- 17% and OS of 71% +/- 16%. Two patients developed late second malignancies; I was associated with germline p53 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that carboplatin has similar activity to cisplatin in otherwise similar regimens. Five-year survival data are comparable to those reported in other recent studies, including high-dose chemotherapy studies. Of note is the marked activity in CPCA and gross totally resected EP.

In GBM, a subpopulation of CD133-positive cancer initiating cells displays stem cell characteristics. The Polycomb group (PcG) and oncogene BMI1 is part of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that regulates gene expression by modifying chromatin organization. Here we show that BMI1 is expressed in human GBM tumors and highly enriched in CD133-positive cells. Stable BMI1 knockdown using short hairpin RNA-expressing lentiviruses resulted in inhibition of clonogenic potential in vitro and of brain tumor formation in vivo. Cell biology studies support the notion that BMI1 prevents CD133-positive cell apoptosis and/or differentiation into neurons and astrocytes, depending on the cellular context. Gene expression analyses suggest that BMI1 represses alternate tumor suppressor pathways that attempt to compensate for INK4A/ARF/P53 deletion and PI(3)K/AKT hyperactivity. Inhibition of EZH2, the main component of the PRC2, also impaired GBM tumor growth. Our results reveal that PcG proteins are involved in GBM tumor growth and required to sustain cancer initiating stem cell renewal.

H-1-MRSI evidence for cortical gray matter pathology that is independent of cerebral white matter lesion load in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Cortical grey matter; Cortical lesions; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging; N-acetyl aspartate; White matter lesions	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; N-ACETYL-ASPARTATE; METABOLITE CHANGES; MR SPECTROSCOPY; AXONAL DAMAGE; TARGET NEURONS; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VITRO; DEMYELINATION; GREY	We examined: (i) neuro-axonal disturbance (as indicated by H-1-MRSI NA/Cr values) in the cortical grey matter (cGM) of 10 untreated patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) and 10 with secondary-progressive (SP) multiple sclerosis (MS), and (ii) the relationships between cGM-NA/Cr values and the degree of EDSS-measured clinical disability and cerebral white-matter (WM) lesion load (LL) in these patients. Whereas mean and median cGM-NA/Cr values in our RR group were similar to those in 18 age-matched normal controls (NC), large statistically-significant decreases (between 14.3% and 18.5%) were found in our SP group relative to both our RR and NC groups. When data from all patients was combined, we found: (i) a large negative correlation between EDSS scores and cGM-NA/Cr values (r = -0.55); and (ii) a larger negative correlation of cGM-NA/Cr values with cerebral T1-hypointese WM-LL (T1-LL, r = -0.73) than with cerebral T2-hyperintense-LL (T2-LL, r = -0.63). Importantly, (i) correlations of WM-LL with cGM-NA/Cr were larger in the RR group than in the SP group (T1-LL: r = -0.79 vs. -0.54; T2-LL: r = -0.63 vs. -0.51), and (ii) cerebral WM-LL values could not fully account for the extent of the decrease in mean cGM-NA/Cr that was seen in our SP group relative to our NC group. Our observations are consistent with the possibilities that: (i) in patients with RR-MS, H-1-MRSI-measured cGM neuro-axonal disturbances are strongly related to the effects of axonal transection that are associated with cerebral WM lesions; and (ii) in patients with SP-MS, such cGM neuro-axonal disturbances are more severe and are associated with a more-widespread degenerative process (which probably includes a considerable degree of cortical demyelination).

This study uses fully automated, surface-based techniques to analyse position and surface area asymmetry for the mid-surfaces of 112 right-handed subjects' cortical hemispheres from a cohort of young adults. Native space measurements of local surface area asymmetry and vertex position asymmetry were calculated from surfaces registered to a previously validated hemisphere-unbiased surface-based template. Our analysis confirms previously identified hemispheric asymmetries (Yakovlevian torque, frontal and occipital petalia) in enhanced detail. It does not support previous findings of gender/asymmetry interactions or rightward planum parietale areal increase. It reveals several new findings, including a striking leftward increase in surface area of the supramarginal gyrus (peak effect 18%), compared with a smaller areal increase in the left Heschl's gyrus and planum temporale region (peak effect 8%). A second finding was rightward increase in Surface area (peak effect 10%) in a hand around the medial junction between the occipital lobe, and parietal and temporal lobes. By clearly separating out the effects of structural translocation and surface area change from those of thickness and curvature, this study resolves the confound of these variables inherent in VBM studies.

Pattern of hippocampal shape and volume differences in blind subjects	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							VERBAL MEMORY PERFORMANCE; TAXI DRIVERS; VISUAL EXPERIENCE; HUMAN NAVIGATION; PLACE CELLS; NEUROGENESIS; ACTIVATION; BRAIN; MRI; EXPLORATION	Numerous studies in animals and humans have shown that the hippocampus (HP) is involved in spatial navigation and memory. Blind subjects, in particular, must memorize extensive information to compensate for their lack of immediate updating of spatial information. Increased demands on spatial cognition and memory may be associated with functional and structural HP plasticity. Here we examined local size and shape differences in the HP of blind and sighted individuals. A 3D parametric mesh surface was generated to represent right and left HPs in each individual, based on manual segmentations of 3D volumetric T1-weighted MR images of 22 blind subjects and 28 matched controls. Using a new surface mapping algorithm described in (Shi, Y., Thompson, P.M., de Zubicaray, G.I., Rose, S.E., Tu, Z., Dinov, I., Toga, A.W., Direct mapping of hippocampal surfaces with intrinsic shape context, NeuroImage, Available online May 24, (In Press).), we created an average hippocampal surface for the controls, and computed its normal distance to each individual surface. Statistical maps were created to visualize systematic anatomical differences between groups, and randomization tests were performed to correct for multiple comparisons. In both scaled and unscaled data, the anterior right HP was significantly larger, and the posterior right HP significantly smaller in blind individuals. No significant differences were found for left HP. These differences may reflect adaptive responses to sensory deprivation, and/or increased functional demands on memory systems. They offer a neuroanatomical substrate for future correlations with measures of navigation performance or functional activations related to variations in cognitive strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we coupled functional magnetic resonance imaging and a multiround economic exchange game ('trust game') to probe mentalizing, the social-cognitive ability to attribute mental states to others. Relative to interactions with a computer, those with human partners ('mentalizing') elicited less activation of medial prefrontal cortex in generalized social anxiety patients compared with matched healthy control participants. Diminished medial prefrontal cortex function may play a role in the social-cognitive pathophysiology of social anxiety.

During embryonic development, interactions between the ligands and receptors define tissue boundaries, Guide migrating axons, and regulate angiogenesis, as well as bone morphogenesis. These molecules have also been shown to modify neural activity in the adult nervous system and influence tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse functions are not completely understood. In this study, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify molecules that physically interact with Eph receptors using the cytoplasmic domain of EphA3 as "bait". This study identified Nck1 as a strong binding partner of EphA3 as assayed using both GST fusion protein pull down and co-immunoprecipitation techniques. The interaction is mediated through binding of the Nckl SH2 domain to the phosphotyrosine residue at position 602 (Y602) of the EphA3 receptor. The removal of the SH2 domain or the mutation of the Y602 residue abolishes the interaction. We further demonstrated that EphA3 activation inhibits cell migration and process outgrowth, and these inhibiting effects are partially alleviated by dominant-negative Nck1 mutants that lack functional SH2 or SH3 domains, but not by the wild-type Nck1 gene. These results suggest that Nck1 interacts with EphA3 to regulate cell migration and process retraction.

Climatic Patterns Predict the Elaboration of Song Displays in Mockingbirds	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							BIG BRAINS; BIRDS; COGNITION; ENVIRONMENTS; EVOLUTION; SIZE; VARIABILITY; SELECTION; CHOICE; MATTER	Climatic variability and unpredictability [1] affect the distribution and abundance of resources and the timing and duration of breeding opportunities. In vertebrates, climatic variability selects for enhanced cognition when organisms compensate for environmental changes through learning and innovation [2-5]. This hypothesis is supported by larger brain sizes [6], higher foraging innovation rates [7-9], higher reproductive flexibility [10-12], and higher sociality [13] in species living in more variable climates. Male songbirds sing to attract females and repel rivals [14]. Given the reliance of these displays on learning and innovation, we hypothesized that they could also be affected by climatic patterns. Here we show that in the mockingbird family (Aves: Mimidae), species subject to more variable and unpredictable climates have more elaborate song displays. We discuss two potential mechanisms for this result, both of which acknowledge that the complexity of song displays is largely driven by sexual selection [15, 16]. First, stronger selection in more variable and unpredictable climates could lead to the elaboration of signals of quality [14, 17-20]. Alternatively, selection for enhanced learning and innovation in more variable and unpredictable climates might lead to the evolution of signals of intelligence in the context of mate attraction [14, 21-23].

We compare predictions from the standard correlation model of motion perception with a model based on phase locking observed during periodic stimulation of an integrate-and-fire nonlinear oscillator. The close agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental observations suggests the possibility that periodic forcing of nonlinear neural oscillations may play a role in motion perception.

Given that actinonin's effects against membrane-bound MMPs remain unknown and that MT1-MMP has been linked to chemo- and radio-therapy resistance in brain tumor development, we therefore assessed MT1-MMP functional inhibition by actinonin in U87 glioblastoma cells. We show that actinonin inhibits concanavalin-A (ConA)-induced proMMP-2 activation, while it does not inhibit ConA-induced MT1-MMP gene expression suggesting post-transcriptional effects of the drug possibly mediated through the membrane-anchored protease regulator RECK. Specific gene silencing of MT1-MMP with siRNA abrogated the ability of ConA to activate proMMP-2. Functional recombinant MT1-MMP whose constitutive expression led to proMMP-2 activation was also efficiently antagonized by actinonin. We provide evidence for actinonin's new therapeutic application in the direct targeting of MT1-MMP mediated proMMP-2 activation, an essential step in both brain tumor infiltration and in brain tumor-associated angiogenesis.

Phosphorylation of Prion Protein at Serine 43 Induces Prion Protein Conformational Change	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							K-RESISTANT CONFORMATION; TRANSGENIC MICE; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; IN-VITRO; NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS; HUMAN NEURONS; SCRAPIE; CONVERSION; DISEASE; PRP	The cause of the conformational change of normal cellular prion protein (PrP) into its disease-associated form is unknown. Posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation, acetylation, S-nitrosylation, and phosphorylation, are known to induce protein conformational changes. Here, we investigated whether phosphorylation could induce the conformational change of PrP because PrP contains several kinase motifs and has been found recently in the cytosol, in which kinases generally reside. Neuronal cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylated recombinant PrP(23-231) at serine 43 (S43) in an in vitro kinase assay. Cdk5-phosphorylated PrP became proteinase K resistant, formed Congo Red-positive fibrils, and formed aggregates that were immunostained with anti-PrP and anti-phospho-PrP(S43) (anti-pPrP(S43)). pPrP(S43) was detected in PrP/Cdk5/p25 cotransfected N2a cells. Roscovitine inhibition of Cdk5 activity or transfection of N2a cells with mutant PrP S43A eliminated the anti-pPrP(S43)-immunopositive protein. Alkaline phosphatase-sensitive and proteinase K-resistant pPrP(S43) immunoreactivity was observed in scrapie-infected but not control-injected mice brains. These results raise the possibility that phosphorylation could represent a physiological mechanism of PrP conversion in vivo.

This mixture is formed by the three main classes of lipids found in the stratum corneum (SC), the top layer of the epidermis, and provides an optimized hydrophobic matching. Therefore, its behavior highlights the role played by hydrophobic matching oil the phase behavior of SC lipids. We found that, below 45 degrees C, the mixture is essentially formed of coexisting crystalline domains with a small fraction of lipids (less than 20%) that forms a gel or fluid phase, likely ensuring cohesion between the solid domains. Upon heating, there is the formation of a liquid ordered phase mainly composed of PA and cholesterol, including a small fraction of Cer16. This Finding is particularly highlighted by correlation vibrational microspectroscopy that indicates that domains enriched in cholesterol and PA include more disordered Cer16 than those found in the Cer16-rich domains. Solubilization of Cer16 in the fluid phase occurs progressively upon further heating, and this leads to the formation of a nonlamellar self-assembly where the motions are isotropic on the NMR time scale. It is round that the miscibility or Cer16 with cholesterol and PA is more limited than the one previously observed for ceramide III extracted from bovine brain, which is heterogeneous in chain composition and includes, in addition to Cer16, analogous ceramide with longer alkyl chains that are not hydrophobically matched with cholesterol and PA. Therefore, it is inferred that, in SC, the chain heterogeneity is a stronger criteria for lipid miscibility than chain hydrophobic matching.

However, several other large studies, including five genome-wide association studies, have not duplicated this finding. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of 10 published studies and one unpublished study of the paraoxonase locus, encompassing 4,037 ALS cases and 4,609 controls, including genome-wide association data from 2,018 ALS cases and 2,425 controls. Results: The combined fixed effects odds ratio (OR) for rs662(PON1Q192R) was 1.09(95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.16, p = 0.01); the genotypic OR for RR homozygotes at Q192R was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.45, p = 0.0004); the combined OR for rs854560(PON1L55M) was 0.97(95% CI, 0.86-1.10, p = 0.62); the OR for rs10487132 (PON2) was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.92-1.27, p = 0.35). Although the rs662 polymorphism reached a nominal level of significance, no polymorphism was significant after multiple testing correction. In the subanalysis of samples with genome-wide data from which population outliers were removed, rs662 had an OR of 1.06 (95% CI, 0.97-1.16, p = 0.22). Conclusions: In contrast to previous positive smaller studies, our genetic meta-analysis showed no significant association of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with the PON locus. This is the largest meta-analysis of a candidate gene in ALS to date and the first ALS meta-analysis to include data from whole genome association studies. The findings reinforce the need for much larger and more collaborative investigations of the genetic determinants of ALS. Neurology (R) 2009; 73: 16-24	[Wills, A-M.; Landers, J. E.; Brown, R.

Using fMRI, we have previously studied the patterns of activity observed in patients with PD after overnight removal of dopaminergic medication compared with control participants during the performance of different stages of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST). The results revealed decreased cortical activity in the PD group compared to controls in the conditions that significantly required striatum, while increased cortical activity was observed when striatum was not involved. However, the effect of dopaminergic medication in PD patients on those patterns of activity has not yet been studied. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, eleven PD patients at early stage of the disease taking L-Dopa medication were recruited and underwent two fMRI sessions while performing the WCST: one session while taking their normal dose of medication and the other following overnight dopaminergic medication withdrawal. We found that L-dopa medication helped restoring a normal pattern of activity when matching and not planning was required, by increasing cortical activity in the premotor cortex. This effect was even stronger in the motor loop, i.e. when the putamen was required for controls, when matching following negative feedback. However, the medication did not change the pattern of activity in conditions relying primarily on a cognitive loop, i.e. when the caudate nucleus was required. Conclusions/Significance: These studies provide explanation at the neural level regarding the relatively poor effects of L-Dopa on the cognitive deficits observed in PD.

J	Forlini, C; Racine, E				Forlini, Cynthia; Racine, Eric			Disagreements with implications: diverging discourses on the ethics of non-medical use of methylphenidate for performance enhancement	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							PRESCRIPTION STIMULANTS; STUDENT SAMPLE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; COLLEGE-STUDENTS; ENHANCING DRUGS; WORKING-MEMORY; YOUNG-ADULTS; PRINT MEDIA; HUMAN BRAIN; ILLICIT USE	Background: There is substantial evidence that methylphenidate (MPH; Ritalin), is being used by healthy university students for non-medical motives such as the improvement of concentration, alertness, and academic performance. The scope and potential consequences of the non-medical use of MPH upon healthcare and society bring about many points of view. Methods: To gain insight into key ethical and social issues on the non-medical use of MPH, we examined discourses in the print media, bioethics literature, and public health literature. Results: Our study identified three diverging paradigms with varying perspectives on the nature of performance enhancement. The beneficial effects of MPH on normal cognition were generally portrayed enthusiastically in the print media and bioethics discourses but supported by scant information on associated risks. Overall, we found a variety of perspectives regarding ethical, legal and social issues related to the non-medical use of MPH for performance enhancement and its impact upon social practices and institutions. The exception to this was public health discourse which took a strong stance against the non-medical use of MPH typically viewed as a form of prescription abuse or misuse. Wide-ranging recommendations for prevention of further non-medical use of MPH included legislation and increased public education. Conclusion: Some positive portrayals of the non-medical use of MPH for performance enhancement in the print media and bioethics discourses could entice further uses. Medicine and society need to prepare for more prevalent non-medical uses of neuropharmaceuticals by fostering better informed public debates.

The cytokine exerts many unique immunologic and biological effects. It is produced as a biologically inactive and leaderless precursor protein, which must be cleaved into its mature form by caspase-1. The caspase-1 also exists in an inactive precursor in the cytosol and needs proteolytic auto-cleavage, which is catalyzed by the assembly of a multi-protein complex called inflammasome. Inside the circulation, interleukin-18 is bound to its naturally occurring antagonist called interleukin-18 binding protein. The antagonist is induced as a negative feedback to increased interleukin-18 production. It protects body cells and tissues from the potentially destructive and harmful proinflammatory effects of the cytokine. Several researchers have reported that the concentrations and biological activities of the cytokine are increased in the circulation of HIV-infected patients. Unlike interleukin-18, the concentrations of its antagonist, interleukin-18 binding protein, are decreased in these persons. The cytokine may play a major role in the development and pathogenesis of AIDS in HIV-infected persons. Insufficient/lack of interleukin-12 and related cytokines may compromise the ability of interleukin-18 to induce interferon-gamma production from natural killer and T-cells. By inducing production of T-helper 2-type cytokines like interleukin-4,-5,-9, and -13 from basophils and mast cells, interleukin-18 promotes the development and differentiation of CD4(+) naive T-cells into T-helper 2-type effector cells, which blunt anti-HIV immunity. The effect may be more pronounced in HIV-infected persons with compromised production of interleukin-12. Interleukin-18 also directly enhances viral replication. Because of its proapoptotic effects, the cytokine decreases survivability and promotes the death of various immune and nonimmune cells. It has also been documented to play a role in the depletion and wasting of subcutaneous fat from the limbs and face. The wasting is a characteristic feature of HIV-associated lipodystrophy. The cytokine is also likely to be involved in the higher incidence of atherosclerotic plaques and systemic insulin resistance in these patients. Finally, increased production of the cytokine in the brain may lead to motor and cognitive dysfunctions, leading to the development of HIV-associated dementia. In conclusion, increased interleukin-18 concentrations in HIV-infected persons are likely to play an important role in the development and progression of the infection toward AIDS and associated clinical conditions. Therefore, its neutralization may represent an appropriate and useful immunotherapeutic strategy in these patients. It may delay AIDS progression and improve the immune status of infected persons. The best way to achieve this goal may be using exogenous interleukin-18 binding protein.

In addition to assessing drugs for symptomatic relief, an increasing number of trials are focusing on potential disease-modifying agents. Moreover, participants with AD are being studied earlier in their course of disease. As a result, the limitations of current outcome measures have become more apparent, as has the need for better instruments. In recognition of the need to review and possibly revise current assessment measures, the Alzheimer's Association, in cooperation with industry leaders and academic investigators, convened a Research Roundtable meeting devoted to scales as outcome measures for AD clinical trials. The meeting included a discussion of methodological issues in the use of scales in AD clinical trials, including cross-cultural issues. Specific topics related to the use of cognitive, functional, global, and neuropsychiatric scales were also presented. Speakers also addressed academic and industry initiatives for pooling data from untreated and placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. A number of regulatory topics were also discussed with agency representatives. Panel discussions highlighted areas of controversy, in an effort to gain consensus on various topics.

Only six patients with this distinctive association have been reported over the past 20 years, all of them being males. Of the patients described here, some have unreported findings such as vermian hypoplasia in one and prolonged survival into adulthood in two. Two patients developed central diabetes insipidus. All were mentally retarded. No abnormalities were found at the cytogenetic level, including array CGH in two. No known genes for holoprosencephaly or ectrodactyly were found, including GLI2. The cause of Hartsfield syndrome is unknown. An X-linked defect is possible, although no recurrences have been described to date. Our observations almost double the number of cases. They underscore the usefulness of fetal brain imaging in the differential diagnosis of syndromal clefting diagnosed in utero, particularly when ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome is suspected.

METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, randomized, and controlled study. Forty patients undergoing stereotactic brain tumor biopsy under regional anesthesia were randomized into two groups to receive remifentanil or propofol titrated to a level of four on the modified Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale. ICP was measured via the biopsy needle. RESULTS: At the targeted level of sedation, the rates of infusion for remifentanil and propofol were, respectively, 4.2 +/- 1.8 mu g . kg(-1) . h(-1) and 4.3 +/- 2.5 mg . kg(-1) . h(-1). At the time of ICP measurement, patients in the remifentanil group had a slower respiratory rate (11/min +/- 3 vs 15 per min +/- 3, P = 0.0001) and a higher PCO(2) (48.3 +/- 6.2 mm Hg vs 43.1 +/- 5.5 mm Hg, P = 0.009) than patients in the propofol group. The mean was similar for both groups, 19.0 +/- 11.9 mm Hg vs 16.4 +/- 11.1 mm Hg for remifentanil and propofol, respectively (P = 0.48). Higher mean arterial blood pressure in the remifentanil group (101.1 +/- 13.7 mm Hg vs 85.8 +/- 12.7 mm Hg, P = 0.0008) resulted in a higher CPP than the propofol group: 82.0 +/- 19.0 mm Hg vs 69.5 +/- 17.0 +/- 19.0 mm Hg (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Light sedation with remifentanil does not result in a higher ICP than propofol in patients undergoing stereotactic brain tumor biopsy. CPP might be better preserved with remifentanil.

Methods: One hundred and twelve subjects without dementia or major depression including 32 idiopathic RBD patients, 22 PD patients with polysomnography-confirmed RBD, 18 PD patients without RBD, and 40 healthy control subjects, underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. We compared the proportion of patients with MCI between groups using standard diagnostic criteria. Results: MCI was found in 50% of idiopathic RBD patients and 73% of PD patients with RBD. In contrast, only 11% of PD patients without RBD and 8% of control subjects had MCI. The presence of MCI was significantly greater in idiopathic RBD patients and PD patients with RBD than in PD patients without RBD and control subjects. PD patients with RBD also performed worse than idiopathic RBD patients on neuropsychological tests assessing visuoconstructional and visuoperceptual abilities. Interpretation: In both its association with PD and its idiopathic form, RBD is an important risk factor for MCI. Except for visuoconstructional and visuoperceptual problems, RBD may be an important determinant of cognitive impairment in PD.

Dysfunction of the Default Mode Network in Parkinson Disease A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORE ASSESSMENT PROGRAM; BRAIN-FUNCTION; BASAL GANGLIA; CONNECTIVITY; ATTENTION; CINGULATE; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS; ACTIVATION	Objective: To examine the integrity of the default mode network in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Previous functional neuroimaging experiments have studied executive deficits in patients with PD with regard to task-related brain activation. However, recent studies suggest that executive performance also relies on the integrity of the default mode network (ie, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and lateral parietal and medial temporal cortices), characterized by a deactivation of these cortical areas during the performance of executive tasks. Design: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate cortical deactivations during a card-sorting task (retrieval and manipulation of short-term memory contents) compared with a simple sensory-motor matching task. In addition, a functional connectivity analysis was performed. Setting: Tertiary outpatient clinic. Participants: Seven patients with mild to moderate PD (not taking medication) and 7 healthy controls. Main Outcome Measure: Cortical deactivations. Results: Both groups showed comparable deactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex but different deactivation in the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus. Compared with controls, patients with PD not only showed less deactivation of the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus, they even demonstrated a reversed pattern of activation and deactivation. Connectivity analysis yielded that in contrast to healthy individuals, medial prefrontal cortex and the rostral ventromedial caudate nucleus were functionally disconnected in PD. Conclusions: We describe specific malfunctioning of the default mode network during an executive task in PD. This finding is plausibly linked to dopamine depletion and may critically contribute to the understanding of executive deficits in PD.

To ensure that this step is achieved efficiently, free cholesterol must accumulate in excess at the outer mitochondrial membrane and then be transferred to the inner membrane. This is accomplished through a series of steps that involve various intracellular organelles, including lysosomes and lipid droplets and proteins such as the translocator protein (18 kDa, TSPO) and steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) proteins. TSPO, previously known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a high-affinity drug- and cholesterol-binding mitochondrial protein. StAR is a hormone-induced mitochondria-targeted protein that has been shown to initiate cholesterol transfer into mitochondria. Through the assistance of proteins such as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit lot (PKA-R1 alpha) and the PKA-R1 alpha- and TSPO-associated acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3) protein, PAP7, cholesterol is transferred to and docked at the outer mitochondrial membrane. The TSPO-dependent import of StAR into mitochondria, and the association of TSPO with the outer/inner mitochondrial membrane contact sites, drives the intramitochondrial cholesterol transfer and subsequent steroid formation. The focus of this review is on (i) the intracellular pathways and protein-protein interactions involved in cholesterol transport and steroid biosynthesis and (ii) the roles and interactions of these proteins in endocrine pathologies and neurological diseases where steroid synthesis plays a critical role.

RUNX proteins often control the balance between proliferation and differentiation and alterations of their functions are associated with different types of cancer and other human pathologies. Moreover, RUNX factors control important steps during the developmental acquisition of mature phenotypes. A number of investigations are beginning to shed light on the involvement of RUNX family members in the development of the nervous system. This review summarizes recent progress in the study of the roles of mammalian RUNX proteins during the differentiation of sensory and motor neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system, respectively. The implications of those findings for RUNX-mediated regulation of hematopoietic development will also be discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Left- and right-hemisphere-damaged participants and normal controls produced literal and idiomatic versions of idioms (He hit the books.) All groups modulated duration to distinguish the interpretations. LHD patients, however, showed typical speech timing difficulties. RHD patients did not differ from the normal controls. The results partially support a differential lateralization of prosodic cues in the two cerebral hemispheres [Van Lancker, D., & Sidtis, J.J. (1992).

By using neurons as basis functions and methods of nonlinear optimization, we are able to compute three states of a 6-D Hamiltonian using only 50 basis functions. In a standard direct product basis, thousands of basis functions would be necessary. Previous NN methods for solving the Schrodinger equation computed one level at a time and optimized all of the parameters using expensive nonlinear optimization methods. Using our approach, linear coefficients in the NN representation of wave functions are determined with methods of linear algebra and many levels are computed at the same time from one set of nonlinear NN parameters. In addition, we use radial basis function neurons to ensure the correct boundary conditions. The use of linear algebra methods makes it possible to treat systems of higher dimensionality.

For this report, the authors critically analyzed the factors associated with recovery of erectile function after surgery. A systematic review of the literature using the Medline and CancerLit databases was conducted. Keywords for the literature search included prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, erectile dysfunction, impotence, treatment, and prophylaxis. Accurate patient selection (based on patient age, preoperative erectile function, and comorbidity profile) and adequate surgical technique (ie, the preservation of neurovascular bundles) were the major determinants of postoperative erectile function. Moreover, better results were achieved when an appropriate pharmacologic treatment using either oral or local approaches was given. Therefore, the authors concluded that, if patients are stratified correctly according to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors, then a satisfactory functional recovery may be expected after surgery. For these reasons, an ideal multivariate model predicting the restoration of erectile function after surgery should include patient, surgeon, and postsurgical treatment variables. The authors also concluded that the stratification of patients with regard to their risk of developing erectile dysfunction after surgery was feasible based on several parameters, which should be taken into account for correct patient treatment and counseling. To address this objective, accurate tools for predicting the likelihood of complete functional recovery after surgery are needed. Cancer 2009;115(13 suppl):3150-9. (C) 2009 American Cancer Society.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway is altered in most glioblastoma multiforme. PTEN, an important negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway, is also commonly mutated in glioma, leading to constitutive activation of Akt. One ultimate consequence is phosphorylation and inactivation of FOXO forkhead transcription factors that regulate genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, nutrient availability, DNA repair, stress, and angiogenesis. We tested the ability of a mutant FOXO1 factor that is not subject to Akt phosphorylation to overcome dysiregalated PI3K-Akt signaling in two PTEN-null glioma cell lines, U87 and U251. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the mutant FOXO1 successfully restored cell cycle arrest and induced cell death in vitro and prolonged survival in vivo in xenograft models of human glioma (33% survival at I year of animals bearing U251 tumors). However, U87 were much more resistant than U251 to mutant FOXO1-induced death, showing evidence of increased nuclear export and Akt-independent phosphorylation of FOXO1 at S249. A cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor decreased phosphorylation of S249 and rendered U87 cells significantly more susceptible to mutant FOXO1-induced death. Our results indicate that targeting FOXO1, which is at the convergence point of several growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, can effectively induce glioma cell death and inhibit tumor growth. They also highlight the importance of Akt-independent phosphorylation events in the nuclear export of FOXO1.

In physiological and pathological conditions, Met triggers various cellular functions related to cell proliferation, cell migration and the inhibition of apoptosis, and also regulates a genetic program leading to coagulation. Since medulloblastomas (MBs) express high levels of tissue factor (TF), the main initiator of blood coagulation, we therefore examined the link between Met and TF expression in these pediatric tumors. We observed that stimulation of the MB cell line DAOY with HGF led to a marked increase of TF expression and procoagulant activity, in agreement with analysis of clinical MB tumor specimens, in which tumors expressing high levels of Met also showed high levels of TF. The HGF-dependent increase in TF expression and activity required Src family kinases and led to the translocation of TF to actin-rich structures at the cell periphery, suggesting a role of the protein in cell migration. Accordingly, addition of physiological concentrations of the TF activator factor VIIa (FVII) to HGF-stimulated DAOY cells promoted a marked increase in the migratory potential of these cells. Overall, these results suggest that HGF-induced activation of the Met receptor results in TF expression by MB cells and that this event probably contribute to tumor proliferation by enabling the formation of a provisional fibrin matrix. In addition, TF-mediated non-hemostatic functions, such as migration toward FVIIa, may also play a central role in MB aggressiveness.

Altered motile phenotypes are however often associated with the development and progression of diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis. Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is required for cell shape changes and is controlled by a broad variety of cellular proteins. Interestingly, several extracellular stimuli can promote actin reorganization and result in enhanced cell migration. Namely, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are activated by factors ranging from small amines, to hormones, and chemokines, initiate signalling cascades resulting in cell shape changes, formation of a migrating front (leading edge) and altered adhesion. GPCRs; are heptahelical membrane proteins, which classically transmit signal via the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. Sustained stimulation leads to the activation of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and the recruitment of arrestin proteins, which engage alternative signalling pathways. In this review, we will discuss the role of GPCR mediated signal transduction and review their importance in the regulation of actin remodeling leading to cell migration. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The phenotype of FXS is reproduced in fragile X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) knockout (KO) mice that have region-specific altered expression of some gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor subunits. However, little is known about the characteristics of GABAergic inhibition in the subiculum of these animals. We employed patch-clamp recordings from subicular pyramidal cells in an in vitro slice preparation. In addition, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot experiments were performed on subiculum obtained from wild-type (WT) and KO mice. We found that tonic GABA(A) currents were downregulated in fmr1 KO compared with WT neurons, whereas no significant differences were observed in phasic GABA(A) currents. Molecular biology analysis revealed that the tonic GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha 5 and delta were underexpressed in the fmr1 KO mouse subiculum compared with WT. Because the subiculum plays a role in both cognitive functions and epileptic disorders, we propose that altered tonic inhibition in this structure contributes to the behavioral deficits and epileptic activity seen in FXS patients. This conclusion is in line with evidence implicating tonic GABA(A) inhibition in learning and memory.

Neuroanatomical Correlates of Musicianship as Revealed by Cortical Thickness and Voxel-Based Morphometry	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Review						cortical thickness; voxel-based morphometry; musician; cortex; auditory; frontal	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTION PATTERNS; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; ABSOLUTE PITCH; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; PLANUM TEMPORALE	We used a multimethod approach to investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of musicianship and absolute pitch (AP). Cortical thickness measures, interregional correlations applied to these thicknesses, and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were applied to the same magnetic resonance imaging data set of 71 musicians (27 with AP) and 64 nonmusicians. Cortical thickness was greater in musicians with peaks in superior temporal and dorsolateral frontal regions. Correlations between 2 seed points, centered on peaks of thickness difference within the right frontal cortex, and all other points across the cortex showed greater specificity of significant correlations among musicians, with fewer and more discrete areas correlating with the frontal seeds, including the superior temporal cortex. VBM of gray matter (GM)-classified voxels yielded a strongly right-lateralized focus of greater GM concentration in musicians centered on the posterolateral aspect of Heschl's gyrus. Together, these results are consistent with functional evidence emphasizing the importance of a frontotemporal network of areas heavily relied upon in the performance of musical tasks. Among musicians, contrasts of AP possessors and nonpossessors showed significantly thinner cortex among possessors in a number of areas, including the posterior dorsal frontal cortices that have been previously implicated in the performance of AP tasks.

The blood-brain barrier, formed by endothelial cells of the brain capillaries, restricts access to brain cells allowing entry only to amino acids, glucose and hormones needed for normal brain cell function and metabolism. This very tight regulation of brain cell access is essential for the survival of neurons which do not have a significant capacity to regenerate, but also prevents therapeutic compounds, small and large, from reaching the brain. As a result, various strategies are being developed to enhance access of drugs to the brain parenchyma at therapeutically meaningful concentrations to effectively manage disease.

Self-criticism versus neuroticism in predicting depression and psychosocial impairment for 4 years in a clinical sample	COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							NEGATIVE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS; LONGITUDINAL PERSONALITY-DISORDERS; FOLLOW-UP EVALUATION; FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; RELATIVE STABILITY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; 5-FACTOR MODEL; PERFECTIONISM; SUPPORT	The present study extended previous findings demonstrating self-criticism, assessed by the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) (Weissmnan AN, Beck AT. Development and validation of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale: a preliminary investigation. Paper presented at the 86th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 1978), as a potentially important prospective predictor of depressive symptoms and psychosocial functional impairment over time. Using data from a prospective, 4-year study of a clinical sample, DAS self-criticism and neuroticism were associated with self-report depressive symptoms, interviewer-rated major depression, and global domains of psychosocial functional impairment 4 years later. Hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that self-criticism uniquely predicted depressive symptoms, major depression, and global psychosocial impairment 4 years later over and above the Titre I assessments of these outcomes and neuroticism. In contrast, neuroticism was a unique predictor of self-report depressive symptoms only 4 years later. Path analyses were used to test a preliminary 3-wave mediational model and demonstrated that negative perceptions of social support at 3 years mediated the relation between self-criticism and depression/global psychosocial impairment for 4 years.

The geometry of time-varying cross-correlation random fields	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EXCURSION SETS; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; ACTIVATION; TOPOLOGY; IMAGES; MODEL	The goal of this paper is to assess the P-value of local maxima of time-varying cross-correlation random fields. The motivation for this comes from an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, where one seeks connectivity between all pairs of voxels inside the brain at each time point of the recording window. In this way, we extend the results of [Cao, J., Worsley, K.J., 1999b. The geometry of correlation fields with an application to functional connectivity of the brain. The Annals of Applied Probability 9 (4),1021-1057] by searching for high correlations not only over all pairs of voxels, but over all time points as well. We apply our results to an EEG data set of a face recognition paradigm. Our analysis determines those time instants for which there are significantly correlated regions involved in face recognition.

This article will overview current thoughts on the pharmacological and clinical basis for the different classes of drugs currently used for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms/overactive bladder syndrome/and detrusor overactivity. Individual drugs are not discussed in detail; particular consideration is given to therapeutic aspects of the management of the elderly patient. Recent findings An extensive literature review confirms the rationale for using antimuscarinic drugs, and that the currently used drugs are efficacius with an acceptable tolerability and safety. In patients resistant to antimuscarinics, botulinum toxin may be an alternative - the vanilloids resiniferatoxin and capsaicin have very limited use. New therapeutic options with positive proof-of-concept studies, but with limited clinical experience, are beta(3) adrenoceptor agonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Positive signals have been found for other classes of drugs (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, neurokinin receptor-1 antagonists), but available information is not sufficient for proper assessment. Summary Antimuscarinic drugs remain the first-line treatment of the overactive bladder and a favorable efficacy/tolerability-safety ratio can be confirmed. Promising new alternatives are emerging and future controlled studies will decide their place in the therapeutic arsenal.

N-Cadherin Prodomain Cleavage Regulates Synapse Formation In Vivo	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						cadherin; zebrafish; Rohon-Beard; synaptogenesis; prodomain	CELL-ADHESION MOLECULES; BETA-CATENIN; PROTEOLYTIC CLEAVAGE; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; SYNAPTOGENESIS; LOCALIZATION; METALLOPROTEASE; POTENTIATION; VESICLE; NECTIN	Cadherins are initially synthesized bearing a prodomain that is thought to limit adhesion during early stages of biosynthesis. Functional cadherins lack this prodomain, raising the intriguing possibility that cells may utilize prodomain cleavage as a means to temporally or spatially regulate adhesion after delivery of cadherin to the cell surface. In support of this idea, immunostaining for the prodomain of zebrafish N-cadherin revealed enriched labeling at neuronal surfaces at the soma and along axonal processes. To determine whether post-translational cleavage of the prodomain affects synapse formation, we imaged Rohon-Beard cells in zebratish embryos expressing GFP-tagged wild-type N-cadherin (NCAD-GFP) or a GFP-tagged N-cadherin mutant expressing an uncleavable prodomain (PRON-GFP) rendering it nonadhesive. NCAD-GFP accumulated at synaptic microdomains in a developmentally regulated manner, and its overexpression transiently accelerated synapse formation. PRON-GFP was much more diffusely distributed along the axon and its overexpression delayed synapse formation. Our results support the notion that N-cadherin serves to stabilize pre- to postsynaptic contacts early in synapse development and suggests that regulated cleavage of the N-cadherin prodomain may be a mechanism by which the kinetics of synaptogenesis are regulated.

Driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI) is responsible for substantial mortality and injury. Significant gaps in our understanding of DWI re-offending, or recidivism, reduce our ability to practically assess recidivism probability and to match interventions to individual risk profiles. These shortcomings reflect the baffling heterogeneity in the DWI population and the limited focus of much existing DWI recidivism research to psychosocial, psychological and substance use correlates. Approach. This narrative review summarises the evidence for the contribution of neurocognitive and psychobiological mechanisms to DWI behaviour and recidivism. Given the nascent nature of this literature, insight into the putative contribution of these mechanisms to DWI is also drawn from other experimental literatures, particularly those on alcohol use disorders and cognitive and behavioural neuroscience. Key Findings. Alcohol-related neurotoxicity and dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and serotonergic systems may underlie certain offender characteristics consistently correlated with heightened DWI risk, persistence and intervention resistance. Their markers are less vulnerable to sources of bias than subjective psychosocial indices and are more far-reaching than alcohol abuse in explaining DWI behaviour and recidivism. Implications. The investigation of neurocognitive and psychobiological mechanisms in DWI research is a promising avenue for discerning clinically meaningful subgroups within the DWI population. This can lead to research and development in alternative assessment and more targeted intervention technologies. Conclusion. Multidimensional research in DWI and recidivism offers novel avenues for increasing road safety. [Brown TG, Ouimet MC, Nadeau L, Gianoulakis C, Lepage M, Tremblay J, Dongier M.

SCN1A duplications and deletions detected in Dravet syndrome: Implications for molecular diagnosis	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Array CGH; Deletion; Dravet syndrome; Duplication; Early-onset severe epilepsy; Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification; SCN1A	SEVERE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; FEBRILE SEIZURES PLUS; GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; CHANNEL DEFECTS; MUTATIONS; INFANCY; GENE; SUBUNIT; PATIENT; SCN9A	P>Objective: We aimed to determine the type, frequency, and size of microchromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) affecting the neuronal sodium channel alpha 1 subunit gene (SCN1A) in Dravet syndrome (DS), other epileptic encephalopathies, and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). Methods: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was applied to detect SCN1A CNVs among 289 cases (126 DS, 97 GEFS+, and 66 with other phenotypes). CNVs extending beyond SCN1A were further characterized by comparative genome hybridization (array CGH). Results: Novel SCN1A CNVs were found in 12.5% of DS patients where sequence-based mutations had been excluded. We identified the first partial SCN1A duplications in two siblings with typical DS and in a patient with early-onset symptomatic generalized epilepsy. In addition, a patient with DS had a partial SCN1A amplification of 5-6 copies. The remaining CNVs abnormalities were four partial and nine whole SCN1A deletions involving contiguous genes. Two CNVs (a partial SCN1A deletion and a duplication) were inherited from a parent, in whom there was mosaicism. Array CGH showed intragenic deletions of 90 kb and larger, with the largest of 9.3 Mb deleting 49 contiguous genes and extending beyond SCN1A. Discussion: Duplication and amplification involving SCN1A are now added to molecular mechanisms of DS patients. Our findings showed that 12.5% of DS patients who are mutation negative have MLPA-detected SCN1A CNVs with an overall frequency of about 2-3%.

These HFOs are more frequent in the seizure-onset zone (SOZ) and reported to be linked to seizure genesis. We evaluated whether HFO activity changes in a systematic way during the preictal period. Methods: Fifteen minutes of preictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were evaluated in seven consecutive patients with well-defined SOZ. EEG was filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. Ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz) were visually marked, and spectral analysis was performed in seizure-onset as well as nonseizure-onset channels. Linear regressions fitted to the power trends corresponding to intervals of 1, 5, and 15 min before the seizure onset was calculated. Results: Total rates of HFOs were significantly higher in the SOZ than outside. Preictal increases and decreases in HFO rates and band power could be detected in all patients, and they were not limited to the SOZs. These measures were very variable, and no systematic trends were observed when comparing patients or seizures in the same patient. Discussion: High frequencies in the range of 80-500 Hz are present during the preictal period and are more prominent in the SOZ. They do not change in a systematic way before seizure onset for the horizons we tested. The 80-500 Hz band may be used for the localization of seizure-onset areas but may be more difficult to use for seizure prediction purposes.

We aimed to investigate whether minimal EEG changes could underlie these contralateral BOLD responses by using EEG spectral analysis. Methods: We studied 19 patients with focal epilepsy and unilateral spikes. According to the pattern of BOLD activation, patients were divided into Group 1 (ipsi- and contralateral to the spikes) or Group 2 (only ipsilateral). EEG from outside the scanner was used to mark spikes similar to those recorded in the scanner. Epochs of 640 ms before and after the peak of the spikes were chosen as baseline and spike epochs. Spectral analysis was performed in referential montage (FCz reference), and differences between baselines and spikes were analyzed by paired t-test. Results: Significant EEG changes in electrodes contralateral to the spikes were seen in 9 of 10 patients in Group 1 and in only 2 of 10 patients in Group 2 (one patient had two types of spikes that were analyzed separately). Spectral changes were seen in delta and/or theta bands in all patients except one (in Group 1) who had changes in all bands. Discussion: Significant contralateral EEG changes occurred in 90% of contralateral BOLD activations and in only 20% of patients without contralateral BOLD responses. The reason why these changes predominate in lower frequencies rather than in higher frequencies is unclear. These spectral changes in areas corresponding to contralateral activations might reflect poorly synchronized but possibly intense neuronal activity.

In focal epilepsy, generalized-like interictal discharges can reflect either a coexistent generalized epileptic trait or a secondary bilateral synchrony. Using combined measures of the EEG and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity, we studied a 50-year-old patient with both absence-like and symptomatic focal motor seizures. Focal activity induced activation in the lesional area and deactivation in the contralateral central cortex. Generalized spike-and-wave discharges (GSWDs) resulted also in perilesional activation, and multifocal symmetrical cortical and thalamic activations, and deactivation in associative cortical areas. Although the central cortex was involved during both types of epileptic activity, electroencephalography (EEG)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed distinct neuronal networks at the time of the focal or generalized discharges, allowing a clear-cut differentiation of the generators. Whether the patient had distinct epileptic syndromes or distinct electrographic patterns from the lesional trigger remains debatable.

The superior efficacy of CLOZ compared with other antipsychotic agents has been attributed to in effect oil D1-like and D4 receptors. We examined the binding of LMP, CLOZ and cyamemazine (CMZ), a neuroleptic analog of LMP, to human recombinant dopamine (rDA) receptor subtypes. Methods: Binding studies were performed on frozen membrane suspensions of human rDA receptor subtypes expressed in Sf9 cells. Results: (i) LMP has a high affinity (Ki, nM) for rD2 receptor subtypes (rD2L 8.6; rD2S 4.3; rD3 8.3; rD4.2 7.9); (ii) LMP and CLOZ have comparable affinities for the rD1 receptor (54.3 vs 34.6); (iii) CMZ has high affinities for rD2-like and rD1-like receptors (rD2L 4.6; rD2S 3.3; rD3 6.2; rD4.2 8.5; rD1 3.9; rD5 10.7); (iv) CMZ is 9 times more potent than CLOZ at the rD1 receptor and 5 time,,, more potent than CLOZ at the rD4.2 receptor; (v) CMZ has high affinities for rD1 and rD5 receptor subtypes compared with LMP and CLOZ. Conclusions: If D1 and D4 receptors are important sites for the unique action of CLOZ, the present study points to a need for clinical trials comparing CMZ with CLOZ in schizophrenia and in particular, treatment-resistant schizophrenia, especially given the risk for agranulocytosis with CLOZ.

Sixty one adult patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of unipolar depression were randomized to receive mirtazapine (30 mg/day), paroxetine (20 mg/day), or the combination of both drugs for 6 weeks. Response at week 4 was defined as a 30% reduction in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and at week 6 as a 50% reduction in the MADRS. Remission was defined as a reduction in the MADRS score to 10 points or less. After 4 weeks, non-responders in the monotherapy groups had their medication dose increased by 50%. After 6 weeks, non-responders on monotherapy had the second trial drug added to their current regimen. Non-responders on combination therapy had the dosage of both drugs increased by 50%. There was a significantly greater decrease in MADRS scores in the combination group compared to the monotherapy groups at days 28, 35 and 42, with a 10 point difference separating the combination from the monotherapies at day 42. Remission rates at week 6 were 19% on mirtazapine, 26% on paroxetine, and 43% on the combination. Fifteen patients in the mirtazapine arm and 10 in the paroxetine arm who did not respond had the other drug added to their current regimen, and 5 on the combination had an increase in dose of both drugs secondary to non-response. Of these 30 patients, approximately 50% went on to achieve remission in the subsequent 2 weeks. These results indicate that the combined use of two antidepressants was well tolerated and produced a greater improvement than monotherapy. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In Purkinje cells, both complex and simple spike network patterns are evident in sensorimotor behavior. However, task-related patterns of activity in the granule cell layer (GCL) have been less studied. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity simultaneously in pairs of GCL sites in monkeys performing an active expectancy (lever-press) task, in passive expectancy, and at rest. LFP sites were selected when they showed strong 10-25 Hz oscillations; pair orientation was in stereotaxic sagittal and coronal (mainly), and diagonal. As shown previously, LFP oscillations at each site were modulated during the lever-press task. Synchronization across LFP pairs showed an evident basic anisotropy at rest: sagittal pairs of LFPs were better synchronized (more than double the cross-correlation coefficients) than coronal pairs, and more than diagonal pairs. On the other hand, this basic anisotropy was modifiable: during the active expectancy condition, where sagittal and coronal orientations were tested, synchronization of LFP pairs would increase just preceding movement, most notably for the coronal pairs. This lateral extension of synchronization was not observed in passive expectancy. The basic pattern of synchronization at rest, favoring sagittal synchrony, thus seemed to adapt in a dynamic fashion, potentially extending laterally to include more cerebellar cortex elements. This dynamic anisotropy in LFP synchronization could underlie GCL network organization in the context of sensorimotor tasks.

However, the discrete cellular events involved in the three-dimensional maturation of oligodendrocytes remain to be fully described. To address this, we followed the developmental stages of oligodendrocytes in mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures for 7-60 days using viral-mediated gene delivery of membrane-targeted fluorescent proteins. Using static and time-lapse confocal imaging, we find that postmigratory NG2-expressing cells exhibit slow anatomical reorganization over the course of hours. This is in direct contrast to oligodendrocytes that take on a promyelinating and transitional phenotype, which display a more complex morphology and undergo dramatic actin-dependent structural remodeling over just minutes. More mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, which have pruned most of their processes, still retain some local remodeling behavior at developing internodes, but in general, revert to a relatively stable state. Our findings provide a detailed characterization of cellular events that help shape oligodendrocyte morphology and likely participate in neuron-glial cell interactions and the process of myelination.

The aims of this study were to determine whether L-ornithine and phenylacetate/phenylbutyrate (administered as the pro-drug phenylbutyrate) (OP) combined are synergistic and produce sustained reduction in ammonia by L-ornithine acting as a substrate for glutamine synthesis, thereby detoxifying ammonia, and the phenylacetate excreting the ornithine-derived glutamine as phenylacetylglutamine in the urine. Sprague-Dawley rats were studied 4 weeks after bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham operation. Study 1: Three hours before termination, an internal carotid sampling catheter was inserted, and intraperitoneal saline (placebo), OP, phenylbutyrate, or L-ornithine were administered after randomization. BDL was associated with significantly higher arterial ammonia and brain water and lower brain myoinositol (P < 0.01, respectively), compared with sham-operated controls, which was significantly improved in the OP-treated animals; arterial ammonia (P < 0.001), brain water (P < 0.05), brain myoinositol (P < 0.001), and urinary phenylacetylglutamine (P < 0.01). Individually, L-ornithine or phenylbutyrate were similar to the BDL group. In study 2, BDL rats were randomized to saline or OP administered intraperitoneally for 6 hours or 3, 5, or 10 days and were sacrificed between 4.5 and 5 weeks. The results showed that the administration of OP was associated with sustained reduction in arterial ammonia (P < 0.01) and brain water (P < 0.01) and markedly increased arterial glutamine (P < 0.01) and urinary excretion of phenylacetylglutamine (P < 0.01) in each of the OP treated groups. Conclusion: The results of this study provide proof of the concept that L-ornithine and phenylbutyrate/phenylacetate act synergistically to produce sustained improvement in arterial ammonia, its brain metabolism, and brain water in cirrhotic rats.

L-Ornithine Phenylacetate Attenuates Increased Arterial and Extracellular Brain Ammonia and Prevents Intracranial Hypertension in Pigs with Acute Liver Failure	HEPATOLOGY			English	Article							HEPATIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY; GLUTAMINE-SYNTHETASE; INTERORGAN AMMONIA; ALBUMIN DIALYSIS; INBORN-ERRORS; KIDNEY PLAYS; L-ASPARTATE; UREA-CYCLE; MAJOR ROLE; CIRRHOSIS	Hyperammonemia is a feature of acute liver failure (ALF), which is associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain herniation. We hypothesized that a combination of L-ornithine and phenylacetate (OP) would synergistically reduce toxic levels of ammonia by (1) L-ornithine increasing glutamine production (ammonia removal) through muscle glutamine synthetase and (2) phenylacetate conjugating with the ornithine-derived glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted into the urine. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of OP on arterial and extracellular brain ammonia concentrations as well as ICP in pigs with ALF (induced by liver devascularization). ALF pigs were treated with OP (L-ornithine 0.07 g/kg/hour intravenously; phenylbutyrate, prodrug for phenylacetate; 0.05 g/kg/hour intraduodenally) for 8 hours following ALF induction. ICP was monitored throughout, and arterial and extracellular brain ammonia were measured along with phenylacetylglutamine in the urine. Compared with ALF + saline pigs, treatment with OP significantly attenuated concentrations of arterial ammonia (589.6 +/- 56.7 versus 365.2 +/- 60.4 mu mol/L [mean +/- SEM], P = 0.002) and extracellular brain ammonia (P = 0.01). The ALF-induced increase in 1CP was prevented in ALF + OP-treated pigs (18.3 +/- 1.3 mmHg in ALF + saline versus 10.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg in ALF + OP-treated pigs; P = 0.001). The value of 1CP significantly correlated with the concentration of extracellular brain ammonia (r(2) = 0.36, P < 0.001). Urine phenylacetylglutamine levels increased to 4.9 +/- 0.6 mu mol/L in ALF + OP-treated pigs versus 0.5 +/- 0.04 mu mol/L in ALF + saline-treated pigs (P < 0.001). Conclusion: L-Ornithine and phenylacetate act synergistically to successfully attenuate increases in arterial ammonia, which is accompanied by a significant decrease in extracellular brain ammonia and prevention of intracranial hypertension in pigs with ALF.

In contrast, independent component analysis (ICA) can extract Blood-Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) responses without imposing constraints on the HRF. This technique was evaluated on data generated by superimposing artificial responses on real background fMRI signals. Simulations were run using a wide range of EEG spiking rates, HRF amplitudes, and activation regions. The data were decomposed by spatial ICA into independent components. A deconvolution method then identified component time courses significantly related to the simulated spikes, without constraining the shape of the HRF. Components matching the simulated activation regions ("concordant components") were found in 84.4% of simulations, while components at discordant locations were found in 12.2% of simulations. These false activations were often related to large artifacts that coincidentally occurred simultaneously with some of the random simulated spikes. The performance of the method depended closely on the simulation parameters; when the number of spikes was low, concordant components could only be identified when HRF amplitudes were large. Although ICA did not depend on the shape of the HRF, data processed with the GLM did not reveal the appropriate activation region when the HRF varied slightly from the canonical shape used in the model. ICA may thus be able to extract BOLD responses from EEG-fMRI data in epileptic patients, in a way that is robust to uncertainty and variability in the shape of the HRF.

The present study was thus designed to identify, through functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3.0 Tesla in 13 skilled imagers, the cerebral structures implicated in VI and KI. Participants were scanned in a perceptual control condition and while physically executing or focusing during motor imagery on either the visual or kinesthetic components of an explicitly known sequence of finger movements. Subjects' imagery abilities were assessed using well-established psychological, chronometric, and new physiological measures from the autonomic nervous system. Compared with the perceptual condition, physical executing, VI, and KI resulted in overlapping (albeit non-identical) brain activations, including motor-related regions and the inferior and superior parietal lobules. By contrast, a divergent pattern of increased activity was observed when VI and KI were compared directly: VI activated predominantly the occipital regions and the superior parietal lobules, whereas KI yielded more activity in motor-associated structures and the inferior parietal lobule. These results suggest that VI and KI are mediated through separate neural systems, which contribute differently during processes of motor learning and neurological rehabilitation.

During childhood and adolescence, prominent changes take place in the brain. Recently, variation in frontal, temporal, and parietal areas was found to be under varying genetic control between 5 and 19 years of age. However, at the onset of puberty, the extent to which variation in brain structures is influenced by genetic factors (heritability) is not known. Moreover, whether a direct link between human pubertal development and brain structure exists has not been studied. Here, we studied the heritability of brain structures at 9 years of age in 107 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs (N = 210 individuals) using volumetric MRI and voxel-based morphometry. Children showing the first signs of secondary sexual characteristics (N = 47 individuals) were compared with children without these signs, based on Tanner-stages. High heritabilities of intracranial, total brain, cerebellum, and gray and white matter volumes (up to 91%) were found. Regionally, the posterior fronto-occipital, corpus callosum, and superior longitudinal fascicles (up to 93%), and the amygdala, superior frontal and middle temporal cortices (up to 83%) were significantly heritable. The onset of secondary sexual characteristics of puberty was associated with decreased frontal and parietal gray matter densities. Thus, in 9-year-old children, global brain volumes, white matter density in fronto-occipital and superior longitudinal fascicles, and gray matter density of (pre-)frontal and temporal areas are highly heritable. Pubertal development may be directly involved in the decreases in gray matter areas that accompany the transition of our brains from childhood into adulthood. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2184-2196, 2009.

Their etiology is complex involving both environmental and genetic factors. We have recently reported three mutations in the planar cell polarity gene VANGL1 associated with NTDs. The aim of the present study was to define the role of VANGL1 genetic variants in the development of NTDs in a large cohort of various ethnic origins. We identified five novel missense variants in VANGL1, p.Ser83Leu, p.Phe153Ser, p.Arg181Gln, p.Leu202Phe and p.Ala404Ser, occurring in sporadic and familial cases of spinal dysraphisms. All five variants affect evolutionary conserved residues and are absent from all controls analyzed. This study provides further evidence supporting the role of VANGL1 as a risk factor in the development of spinal NTDs. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We can take advantage of this information to estimate the conditional density p(Y|X = x). In this paper, we propose a conditional mixture model with hybrid Pareto components to estimate p(Y|X = X). The hybrid Pareto is a Gaussian whose upper tail has been replaced by a generalized Pareto tail. A third parameter, in addition to the location and spread parameters of the Gaussian, controls the heaviness of the upper tail. Using the hybrid Pareto in a mixture model results in a nonparametric estimator that can adapt to multimodality, asymmetry, and heavy tails. A conditional density estimator is built by modeling the parameters of the mixture estimator as functions of X. We use a neural network to implement these functions. Such conditional density estimators have important applications in many domains such as finance and insurance. We show experimentally that this novel approach better models the conditional density in terms of likelihood, compared to competing algorithms: conditional mixture models with other types of components and a classical kernel-based nonparametric model.

The unknown time-varying delay uncertainties are compensated for using appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals in the design, and the effect of the uncertain hysteresis with the Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) model representation is also mitigated using the proposed control. By utilizing the integral-type Lyapunov function, the closed-loop control system is proved to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Brain Dev Cooperative Grp 1	Positive association between cognitive ability and cortical thickness in a representative US sample of healthy 6 to 18 year-olds (vol 37, pg 145, 2009)	INTELLIGENCE			English	Correction						Intelligence; Cognitive ability; IQ; Cortical thickness; Brain imaging; Children; Adolescents	AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; TEST BATTERIES; MRI DATA; ALGORITHM	Neuroimaging studies, using various modalities, have evidenced a link between the general intelligence factor (g) and regional brain function and structure in several multimodal association areas, While in the last few years, developments in computational neuroanatomy have made possible the in vivo quantification of cortical thickness, the relationship between cortical thickness and psychometric intelligence has been little studied. Recently, cortical thickness estimations have been improved by the use of an iterative hemisphere-specific template registration algorithm which provides a better between-subject alignment of brain surfaces. Using this improvement, we aimed to further characterize brain regions where cortical thickness was associated with cognitive ability differences and to test the hypothesis that these regions are mostly located in multimodal association areas. We report associations between a general cognitive ability factor (as an estimate of g) derived from the four subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and cortical thickness adjusted for age, gender, and scanner in a large sample of healthy children and adolescents (ages 6-18, n = 216) representative of the US population. Significant positive associations were evidenced between the cognitive ability factor and cortical thickness in most multimodal association areas. Results are consistent with a distributed model of intelligence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Karama, S.; Ad-Dab'bagh, Y.; Lyttelton, O. C.; Lepage, C.; Evans, A.

Neurologic Outcome at School Entry for Newborns Treated With Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Noncardiac Indications	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; septic shock; surfactant	FOLLOW-UP; INFANTS; SEIZURES; ECMO	The neurologic outcomes at school age in children who Underwent neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for noncardiac indications in a Single institution surviving till the age of 5 years was determined by standardized neurologic assessment. Of 42 newborns undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 24 Underwent neurologic assessment by a single neurologist at 5 years of age. In all, 12 (50%) had a normal neurologic Outcome. Lower gestational age and birth weight was found to be associated with an abnormal outcome as was septic shock as an indication for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation. The number of peri-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation complications experienced by a child was associated with later epilepsy. Although invasive and implemented in critically ill infants, half of newborns Undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation will have a normal neurologic outcome at school age. Preexisting factors, rather than factors related to the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation itself appear to be greater determinants of later neurologic outcomes.

Participants and Procedure: Two hundred eight participants aged 16 years and older with minor to severe TBI were classified as (1) Working/Studying (N = 78), (2) Volunteering (N = 54), or (3) Nonactive (N = 76). Main Outcome Measures: Measures of psychological distress (anxiety depression, cognitive disturbance, irritability/anger), fatigue, sleep disturbance, and perception of pain. Results: Survivors of TBI who report being active through work, studies, or volunteering demonstrate a significantly higher level of psychological adjustment than persons who report no activity. Even among participants who are unable to return to work and are declared on long-term disability leave, those who report engaging in volunteer activities present significantly better psychological functioning than participants who are nonactive. Conclusion: Volunteering is associated with enhanced psychological well-being and should be encouraged following TBI.

We demonstrate high-aspect ratio silicon microelectrodes that reach 6.5 mm in length while having only 10 mu m thickness. The fabrication of such elongated neural microelectrodes could lead to the development of cognitive neural prosthetics. Cognitive neural signals are higher level signals that contain information related to the goal of movements such as reaching and grasping and can be recorded from deeper regions of the brain such as the parietal reach region (PRR). We propose a new concept of reinforcing the regions of the electrodes that are more susceptible to breakage to withstand the insertion axial forces, retraction forces, and tension forces of the brain tissue during surgical implantation. We describe the design techniques, detailed analytical models, and simulations to develop reinforced silicon-based elongated neural electrodes. The electrodes are fabricated using the commercial MicraGem process from Micralyne, Inc. The use of a commercial MEMS fabrication process for silicon neural microelectrodes development yields low-cost, mass-producible, and well-defined electrode structures.

In normal brain, the expression of HO-2 is constitutive, abundant and fairly ubiquitous, whereas HO-1 mRNA and protein are confined to small populations of scattered neurons and neuroglia. In contradistinction to HO-2, the ho-1 gene (Hmox1) is exquisitely sensitive to induction by a wide range of pro-oxidant and other stressors. In Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment, immunoreactive HO-1 protein is over-expressed in neurons and astrocytes of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus relative to age-matched, cognitively intact controls and co-localizes to senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and corpora amylacea. In Parkinson disease, HO-1 is markedly over-expressed in astrocytes of the substantia nigra and decorates Lewy bodies in affected dopaminergic neurons. HMOX1 is also up-regulated in glial cells surrounding human cerebral infarcts, hemorrhages and contusions, within multiple sclerosis plaques, and in other degenerative and inflammatory human CNS disorders. Heme-derived free ferrous iron, CO, and biliverdin/bilirubin are biologically active substances that have been shown to either ameliorate or exacerbate neural injury contingent upon specific disease models employed, the intensity and duration of HO-1 expression and the nature of the prevailing redox microenvironment. In 'stressed' astroglia, HO-1 hyperactivity promotes mitochondrial sequestration of non-transferrin iron and macroautophagy and may thereby contribute to the pathological iron deposition and bioenergetic failure amply documented in Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and other aging-related neurodegenerative disorders. Glial HO-1 expression may also impact cell survival and neuroplasticity in these conditions by modulating brain sterol metabolism and proteosomal degradation of neurotoxic protein aggregates.

The Parkinson disease-associated A30P mutation stabilizes alpha-synuclein against proteasomal degradation triggered by heme oxygenase-1 over-expression in human neuroblastoma cells	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						alpha-synuclein; heme oxygenase-1; Parkinson's disease; proteosome; tau protein	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; A-BETA COMPONENT; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; OXIDATIVE STRESS; IN-VITRO; PRECURSOR PROTEIN; PRIMARY NEURONS; MESSENGER-RNA; TAU-PROTEIN; LEWY BODY	Proteosomal degradation of proteins is one of the major mechanisms of intracellular protein turnover. Failure of the proteosome to degrade misfolded protein is implicated in the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease (PD). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme that converts heme to free iron, carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin (bilirubin precursor) is expressed in response to various stressors. HO-1 is up-regulated in PD- and Alzheimer's disease-affected neural tissues. In this study, we found that HO-1 over-expression engenders dose-dependent decreases in alpha-synuclein protein levels in human neuroblastoma M17 cells. When over-expression of HO-1 was silenced in HO-1 transfected cells, level of alpha-synuclein was restored. Likewise, treatment of HO-1 over-expressing cells with the HO-1 inhibitor, tin mesoporphyrin, the iron chelator deferoxamine or antagonist of CO-dependent cGMP activation, methylene blue, mitigated the HO-1-induced reduction in alpha-synuclein levels. Furthermore, when HO-1 over-expressing cells were treated with the proteosome inhibitors, lactacystin and MG132, level of alpha-synuclein was almost completely restored. In contrast to the effect on alpha-synuclein [wild-type (WT)] levels, HO-1 over-expression did not significantly impact PD-associated alpha-synuclein (A30P) levels in these cells. HO-1 also significantly reduced aggregation of alpha-synuclein (WT) but not that of A30P. Our results suggest that HO-1, which is expressed when neurons are exposed to toxic stimuli capable of inducing protein misfolding, triggers proteosomal degradation of proteins and prevents intracellular accumulation of protein aggregates and inclusions. Resistance to HO-1 induced proteosomal degradation may render the familial PD-associated A30P mutation prone to toxic intracellular aggregation.

As neurohormones, these peptides intervene in the regulation of vital functions such as parturition, lactation, osmotic and cardiovascular regulation. The release of these peptides in the general circulation depends on the electrical activity of their parent neurones, which in turn is regulated by the activity of their afferent inputs conveying distinct information. Thus, in view of the diversity of information governing the activity of magnocellular neurones, it is crucial that the system adapts the appropriate release of oxytocin and vasopressin upon physiological demand. Until recently, it was considered that only neurones could provide such adaptation and regulation. However, a third partner of the synapse, the astrocyte, has been shown to provide further control. Astrocytic processes are in proximity of the magnocellular neurones and their synapses, well positioned to detect and modulate synaptic signals. For instance, astrocytes detect a synaptic signal owing to their diverse neurotransmitter/neuropeptide receptors. In addition, they release a variety of neuroactive substances (i.e. gliotransmitters), which in turn modulate synaptic activity. An important gliotransmitter is the amino acid, d-serine, which, together with glutamate, activates NMDA receptors. Once activated, NMDA receptors govern the weight of individual inputs on magnocellular neurones and thus the impact of distinct types of information on neuronal activity. As reviewed here, numerous observations show that astrocytes must be considered as key elements in the functioning of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system.

Dynamic characterization of agonist and antagonist oculomotoneurons during conjugate and disconjugate eye movements. J Neurophysiol 102: 28-40, 2009. First published April 29, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.00169.2009. In this report, we provide the first quantitative characterization of the relationship between the spike train dynamics of medial rectus oculomotoneurons (OMNs) and eye movements during conjugate and disconjugate saccades. We show that a simple, first-order model (i.e., containing eye position and velocity terms) provided an adequate model of neural discharges during both ON and OFF-directed conjugate saccades, while a second-order model, which included a decaying slide term, significantly improved the ability to fit neuronal responses by similar to 10% (P < 0.05). To understand how the same neurons drove disconjugate eye movements, we evaluated whether sensitivities estimated during conjugate saccades could be used to predict responses during disconjugate saccades. For the majority of neurons (68%), a conjugate-based model failed, and instead neurons preferentially encoded the position and velocity of the ipsilateral eye. Similar to our previous results with abducens motoneurons, we also found that position and velocity sensitivities of OMNs decreased with increasing velocity, and the simulated population drive of OMNs during disconjugate saccades was less (similar to 10%) than during conjugate saccades. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the activation of the antagonist, as well as agonist, motoneuron pools must be considered to understand the neural control of horizontal eye movements across different oculomotor behaviors. Moreover, we propose that the undersampling of smaller motoneurons (e.g., nontwitch) was likely to account for the missing drive observed during disconjugate saccades; these cells are thought to be more specialized for vergence movements and thus could provide the additional input required to command disconjugate eye movements.

Speech production involves some of the most precise and finely timed patterns of human movement. Here, in the context of jaw movement in speech, we show that spatial precision in speech production is systematically associated with the regulation of impedance and in particular, with jaw stiffness-a measure of resistance to displacement. We estimated stiffness and also variability during movement using a robotic device to apply brief force pulses to the jaw. Estimates of stiffness were obtained using the perturbed position and force trajectory and an estimate of what the trajectory would be in the absence of load. We estimated this "reference trajectory" using a new technique based on Fourier analysis. A moving-average (MA) procedure was used to estimate stiffness by modeling restoring force as the moving average of previous jaw displacements. The stiffness matrix was obtained from the steady state of the MA model. We applied this technique to data from 31 subjects whose jaw movements were perturbed during speech utterances and kinematically matched nonspeech movements. We observed systematic differences in stiffness over the course of jaw-lowering and jaw-raising movements that were correlated with measures of kinematic variability. Jaw stiffness was high and variability was low early and late in the movement when the jaw was elevated. Stiffness was low and variability was high in the middle of movement when the jaw was lowered. Similar patterns were observed for speech and nonspeech conditions. The systematic relationship between stiffness and variability points to the idea that stiffness regulation is integral to the control of orofacial movement variability.

J	Fahmy, M; Moselhi, O				Fahmy, Mohamed; Moselhi, Osama			Forecasting the Remaining Useful Life of Cast Iron Water Mains	JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES			English	Article							CHLORINE DECAY; SOIL; PARAMETERS	Effective asset management strategy of civil infrastructure systems requires integration of technical and financial plans. This is particularly true in managing water mains, which requires knowledge of their current condition and their forecasted remaining useful life. This paper presents a model designed to forecast the remaining useful life of cast iron water mains. The model is easy to use and its generated results are utilized in determining condition rating of the water mains being considered. The model considers factors related to pipe properties, its operating conditions, and the external environment that surrounds the pipe. In addition, it overcomes limitations associated with existing models. Three different data-driven techniques are considered in the model development; each is used to study the relationship between remaining useful life and a set of deterioration factors, and to forecast remaining useful life of cast iron water mains. These techniques are multiple regression and two types of artificial neural networks: multilayer perceptron; and general regression neural network. The data used in model development were acquired from 16 municipalities in Canada and the United States. The results produced by the developed models correlate well with the actual conditions.

Robert			Discovery and Pharmacological Characterization of a Small-Molecule Antagonist at Neuromedin U Receptor NMUR2	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION; MICE; RAT; RESPONSES; SUBTYPE; STRESS; LIGAND; ASSAY; FM3	Neuromedin U (NMU), through its cognate receptor NMUR2 in the central nervous system, regulates several important physiological functions, including energy balance, stress response, and nociception. By random screening of our corporate compound collection with a ligand binding assay, we discovered (R)-5'-(phenylaminocarbonylamino)spiro[1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3,2'(3'H)furo[2,3-b]pyridine] (R-PSOP), a highly potent and selective NMUR2 antagonist. R-PSOP is a nonpeptidic small-molecule with the chemical composition C20N4O2H22. In competition binding experiments, this compound was found to bind to NMUR2 with high affinity; the K-i values were determined to be 52 and 32 nM for the human and rat NMUR2, respectively. Moreover, in functional assays measuring phosphoinositide turnover or intracellular calcium mobilization, R-PSOP strongly inhibited the responses stimulated by peptide agonists NMU-25, NMU-23, and NMU-8 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing NMUR2. From Schild analyses, the functional K-b values for R-PSOP were determined to be 92 and 155 nM at human and rat NMUR2, respectively. Highly selective for NMUR2, R-PSOP exhibited low affinity to the other subtype of NMU receptor, NMUR1, with a K-i value >10 mu M. R-PSOP in vivo attenuated NMU-23-evoked nociceptive responses in a rat spinal reflex preparation. To our knowledge, this is the first antagonist ever reported for NMU receptors. This compound could serve as a valuable tool for further understanding the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NMU system, while providing a chemical starting point that may lead to development of new therapeutics for treatment of eating disorders, obesity, pain, and stress-related disorders.

Although the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; Brodmann area [BA] 24) has been increasingly investigated for its role in the etiology of MDD, there is surprisingly very little information about the possible implication of this brain region in suicide. We hypothesized that changes in BA24 cell densities occur in depressed individuals who commit suicide, possibly reflecting an altered state of cortical plasticity that is thought to occur in depression. Methods: We investigated cell densities and sizes in BA24 among suicide completers and matched sudden-death controls. We examined a 1-cm(3) tissue block from BA24a of the supracallosal ACC in 26 human postmortem brain specimens (13 depressed individuals who committed suicide and 13 controls). We assessed neuronal and glial cell densities as well as neuronal soma sizes in the upper and lower cortical layers using optical fractionator and nucleator 3-dimensional stereological probes. Results: Glial densities, neuronal densities and soma sizes measured in BA24a did not differ significantly between controls and suicide completers. Secondary analyses showed a significant and robust increase in glial cell densities in BA24a of alcohol-dependent depressed suicide completers compared with depressed suicide completers who were not alcohol-dependent (38%) and, to a lesser extent, controls (30%). Limitations: Our study, conducted with tissue samples from men only, made use of a nonspecific stain that does not distinguish between neuronal or glial cell subtypes. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis concerned upper and lower cortical contours rather than individual cortical layers. Conclusion: Our results indicate that in BA24, glial density, neuronal density and soma size are not affected in MDD and suicide. They also suggest that alcohol dependence has an important influence on glial densities in this key limbic structure.

J	Manta, S; Dong, J; Debonnel, G; Blier, P				Manta, Stella; Dong, Jianming; Debonnel, Guy; Blier, Pierre			Enhancement of the function of rat serotonin and norepinephrine neurons by sustained vagus nerve stimulation	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; LOCUS-COERULEUS; 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; DORSAL HIPPOCAMPUS; DOPAMINE NEURONS; FIRING ACTIVITY; BRAIN; RAPHE; VNS; EFFICACY	Background: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a recent intervention for treatment-resistant depression. Electrophysiological recordings in the rat brain showed that VNS increases the firing rate of norepinephrine (NE) neurons after 1 day of stimulation and that of serotonin (5-HT) neurons after 14 days. This study was conducted to further characterize these effects. Methods: We implanted rats with a VNS electrode and stimulator. We used the selective noradrenergic toxin DSP-4 to lesion NE neurons of the locus coeruleus. We recorded dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons under chloral hydrate anesthesia. We recorded hippocampus CA 3 pyramidal neurons using 5-barreled iontophoretic pipettes. Results: Analysis of a previously published data set revealed that VNS increased not only the spontaneous firing rates of NE neurons, but also the percentage of neurons firing in bursts. The enhancement of the 5-HT neuron firing rate by VNS was abolished by lesioning NE neurons. We found that VNS increased the degree of activation of postsynaptic a 1-adrenoceptors on 5-HT neurons, probably through an increased release of endogenous NE. The tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors in the hippocampus was enhanced after 14 days of VNS, as with other antidepressant treatments. Limitations: Our study limitations include the fact that we turned off the stimulator during the electrophysiological recordings, which likely decreased the vagal tone to the brain. Also, we obtained the data while the animals were under anesthesia, therefore studies need to be carried out in unanesthetized rats to ascertain whether the anesthetic agent influenced the changes observed between control rats and those treated with VNS. Conclusion: Vagus nerve stimulation initially increases the firing activity and pattern of NE neurons and subsequently those of 5-HT neurons, presumably as a cascade effect via a 1-postsynaptic adrenoceptors. To date, VNS appears to be a unique antidepressant treatment increasing 5-HT transmission and enhancing the firing activity of NE neurons. These effects could contribute to the effectiveness of VNS in treatment-resistant depression.

Paradoxically, DHEA is present and plays a role in learning and memory in the adult rodent brain, while CYP17 activity and protein are undetectable. To determine if CYP17 is required for DHEA formation and function in the adult rodent brain, we generated CYP17 chimeric mice that had reduced circulating testosterone levels. There were no detectable differences in cognitive spatial learning between CYP17 chimeric and wild-type mice. In addition, while CYP17 mRNA levels were reduced in CYP17 chimeric compared to wild-type mouse brain, the levels of brain DHEA levels were comparable. To determine if adult brain DHEA is formed by an alternative Fe(2+)- dependent pathway, brain microsomes were isolated from wild-type and CYP17 chimeric mice and treated with FeSO(4). Fe(2+) caused comparable levels of DHEA production by both wild-type and CYP17 chimeric mouse brain microsomes; DHEA production was not reduced by a CYP17 inhibitor. Taken together these in vivo studies suggest that in the adult mouse brain DHEA is formed via a Fe(2+)-sensitive CYP17-independent pathway. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To examine to what extent this perceptual pitch deficit may compromise singing, 11 amusic individuals and 11 matched controls were asked to sing a familiar tune with lyrics and on the syllable /la/. Acoustical analysis of sung renditions yielded measures of pitch accuracy (e.g., number of pitch errors) and time accuracy (e.g., number of time errors). The results revealed that 9 out of 11 amusics were poor singers, mostly on the pitch dimension. Poor singers made an anomalously high number of pitch interval and contour errors, produced pitch intervals largely deviating from the score, and lacked pitch stability; however, more than half of the amusics sang in-time. Amusics' variability in singing proficiency was related to their residual pitch perceptual ability. Thus, their singing deficiency might be a consequence of their perceptual deficit. Nevertheless, there were notable exceptions. Two amusic individuals, despite their impoverished perception, sang proficiently. The latter findings are consistent with the existence of separate neural pathways for auditory perception and action.

Features essential to HE modelling were identified. The best-characterized animal models of HE in acute liver failure, the so-called Type A HE, were found to be the hepatic devascularized rat and the rat with thioacetamide-induced toxic liver injury. In case of chronic liver failure, surgical models in the rat involving end-to-side portacaval anastomosis or bile duct ligation were considered to best model minimal/mild (Type B) HE. Unfortunately, at this time, there are no satisfactory animal models of Type C HE resulting from end-stage alcoholic liver disease or viral hepatitis, the most common aetiologies encountered in patients. The commission highlighted the urgent need for such models and of improved models of HE in chronic liver failure in general as well as a need for models of post-transplant neuropsychiatric disorders. Studies of HE pathophysiology at the cellular and molecular level continue to benefit from in vitro and or ex vivo models involving brain slices or exposure of cultured cells (principally cultured astrocytes) to toxins such as ammonia, manganese and pro-inflammatory cytokines. More attention could be paid in the future to in vitro models involving the neurovascular unit, microglia and neuronal co-cultures in relation to HE pathogenesis.

In addition, LSDs may result from mutations in genes not yet implicated in disease. Thus, there are individuals that are diagnosed with apparent LSD based upon clinical criteria where the gene defect remains elusive. The objective of this study was to determine whether comparative proteomics approaches could provide useful insights into such cases. Most LSDs arise from mutations in genes encoding lysosomal proteins that contain mannose 6-phosphate, a carbohydrate modification that acts as a signal for intracellular targeting to the lysosome. We purified mannose 6-phosphorylated proteins by affinity chromatography and estimated relative abundance of individual proteins in the mixture by spectral counting of peptides detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Our rationale was that proteins that are decreased or absent in patients compared with controls could represent candidates for the primary defect, directing biochemical or genetics studies. On a survey of brain autopsy specimens from 23 patients with either confirmed or possible lysosomal disease, this approach identified or validated the genetic basis for disease in eight cases. These results indicate that this protein expression approach is useful for identifying defects in cases of undiagnosed lysosomal disease, and we demonstrated that it can be used with more accessible patient samples, e. g. cultured cells. Furthermore this approach was instrumental in the identification or validation of mutations in two lysosomal proteins, CLN5 and sulfamidase, in the adult form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

Long-term outcome in methylmalonic aciduria: A series of 30 French patients	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Methylmalonic aciduria; Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; Kidney failure; Basal ganglia	CHRONIC-RENAL-FAILURE; PROPIONIC ACIDEMIA; COA MUTASE; TUBULOINTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS; MANAGEMENT; DEFICIENCY; TRANSPLANTATION; MUT(-); LENGTH; DEFECT	Objective: To better delineate the natural history of patients with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA). Study design: Thirty patients with vitamin-B12-unresponsive MMA (25 aged 1.5 to 22.0 years (y) at the end of the study and 5 who died during a metabolic crisis) were managed following standardized guidelines and studied retrospectively. The median follow-up was 8.3 y (range: 1.4-19.5). Patients were investigated with neuropsychological testing, brain MRIs, inulin clearances, biochemical and genetic studies. Results: Fifteen patients had a neonatal onset. Thirteen patients (43%) had significant neurological impairment. Chronic renal disease (CRD) occurred in 14 patients (47%) with a median age of onset of 6.5 y (range 1.5-18.6). Renal function further deteriorated in 4 patients within a median period of 5.8 y (range 2-7.4). Of 25 patients investigated at the enzymatic level, 17 were classified mut degrees, 3 mut-and 5 cbIA. Mortality, number of acute decompensations (p = 0.031), median MMA urinary excretion (p = 0.006) and neurological impairment (p < 0.0001) were higher in mut degrees patients compared to mut-/cbIA patients. Concerning the CRD, no difference incidence was found although the onset of CRD occurred earlier in mut degrees patients and was more severe. Conclusions: Our study provides unique data concerning the progression of renal disease in MMA. Patients with mut degrees phenotype have a more severe phenotype and probably an earlier and more severe CRD than patients with mut-/cbIA phenotype. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we identify kinin receptor B1 (Bdkrb1) as a specific modulator of immune cell entry into the central nervous system (CNS). We demonstrate that the Bdkrb1 agonist R838 (Sar-[D-Phe]des-Arg(9)-bradykinin) markedly decreases the clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in SJL mice(4-6), whereas the Bdkrb1 antagonist R715 (Ac-Lys-[D-beta Nal(7), Ile(8)]des-Arg(9)-bradykinin) resulted in earlier onset and greater severity of the disease. Bdkrb1-deficient (Bdkrb1(-/-)) C57BL/6 mice(7) immunized with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein fragment, MOG(35-55), showed more severe disease with enhanced CNS-immune cell infiltration. The same held true for mixed bone marrow-chimeric mice reconstituted with Bdkrb1(-/-) T lymphocytes, which showed enhanced T helper type 17 (T(H)17) cell invasion into the CNS. Pharmacological modulation of Bdkrb1 revealed that in vitro migration of human T(H)17 lymphocytes across blood-brain barrier endothelium is regulated by this receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that the kallikrein-kinin system is involved in the regulation of CNS inflammation, limiting encephalitogenic T lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS, and provide evidence that Bdkrb1 could be a new target for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Alterations in expression of genes coding for proteins of the neurovascular unit in ischemic liver failure	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Glutamate in the Tripartite Synapse - Functional and Metabolic Relations in Norm and Pathology (Wierzba IV)	AUG 23-27, 2008	Wierzba, POLAND	Polish Acad Sci		Hepatic encephalopathy; Neurovascular unit; Acute liver failure; Blood-brain barrier; Hypothermia; Gene expression; Nitric oxide synthase; Brain edema	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; CEREBRAL EDEMA; RATS; AMMONIA; PERMEABILITY; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; INDOMETHACIN; HYPOTHERMIA; PREVENTS	There is evidence to suggest that integrity of the neurovascular unit may be compromised in acute liver failure (ALF). In order to address this issue from a molecular standpoint, expression of an array of genes coding for key cerebrovascular endothelial cell and tight junction proteins were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in cerebral cortex of rats with ischemic liver failure resulting from hepatic devascularization (portacaval anastomosis followed 24 h later by hepatic artery ligation) compared to appropriate sham-operated controls. Expression of P-glycoprotein, endothelin-1, von Willebrand factor, caveolin-1, occludin, and the endothelial nitric oxide synthase isoform (eNOS) were measured in brain extracts from rats with ALF at coma/edema stages of encephalopathy. The effects of mild hypothermia (35 degrees C) sufficient to prevent cerebral edema in ALF animals on the expression of these genes were also studied. Brain edema and hepatic coma in normothermic ALF rats was accompanied by selective increases in expression of eNOS. Expression of occludin and von Willebrand factor mRNAs were decreased at coma/edema stages of encephalopathy in ALF rats whereas, expression of other cerebrovascular endothelial cell markers endothelin-1, P-glycoprotein, and caveolin-1 were unaffected. Mild hypothermia led to normalization of brain water content and of eNOS mRNA. However, the correlation between increased eNOS expression and encephalopathy/edema grade was poor suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms. These findings underscore the multifactorial nature of brain edema/encephalopathy mechanisms in ALF and question the role of BBB breakdown as a major pathogenetic factor. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Hypothermia attenuates oxidative/nitrosative stress, encephalopathy and brain edema in acute (ischemic) liver failure	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Glutamate in the Tripartite Synapse - Functional and Metabolic Relations in Norm and Pathology (Wierzba IV)	AUG 23-27, 2008	Wierzba, POLAND	Polish Acad Sci		Hepatic encephalopathy; Acute liver failure; Nitric oxide synthase; Oxidative/nitrosative stress; Brain edema; Hypothermia	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; ALPHA-KETOGLUTARATE DEHYDROGENASE; ACUTE AMMONIA INTOXICATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; MILD HYPOTHERMIA; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; RATS; PREVENTS	Encephalopathy and brain edema are serious complications of acute liver failure (ALF). The precise pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible have not been fully elucidated but it has been suggested that oxidative/nitrosative stress is involved. In the present study we evaluated the role of oxidative/nitrosative stress in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and brain edema in rats with ALF resulting from hepatic devascularization. We also studied the effect of hypothermia, a treatment previously shown to delay the progression of encephalopathy and the onset of brain edema, on ALF-induced oxidative stress. ALF rats were sacrificed at precoma and coma stages of encephalopathy along with their appropriate sham-operated controls. Hypothermic ALF rats were sacrificed in parallel with normothermic comatose ALF rats. Nitric oxide production in plasma and brain was assessed indirectly by measuring the level of its stable end products, nitrite/nitrate (NOx), using the Griess reagent. Expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were measured using real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Increased nitrite/nitrate levels were observed in the plasma and frontal cortex in ALF rats at coma stage of encephalopathy compared to sham-operated controls. Increased expression of HO-1 protein and mRNA was observed in the frontal cortex of ALF rats at both precoma and coma stages of encephalopathy. Significant increases in expression of endothelial and inducible NOS mRNA isoforms also occurred at precoma and coma stages of encephalopathy. Expression of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase isoform (nNOS) was not altered by ALF. Hypothermia normalized nitrite/nitrate levels in brain and significantly attenuated HO-1, eNOS and iNOS expression. These results suggest that, oxidative/nitrosative stress participates in the pathogenesis of brain edema and its complications in ALF and that the beneficial effect of hypothermia depends in part on its ability to inhibit oxidative/nitrosative stress-related mechanisms.

Astrocytes are a major target in thiamine deficiency and Wernicke's encephalopathy	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Glutamate in the Tripartite Synapse - Functional and Metabolic Relations in Norm and Pathology (Wierzba IV)	AUG 23-27, 2008	Wierzba, POLAND	Polish Acad Sci		Thiamine deficiency; Glutamate; Excitotoxicity; Astrocyte; EAAT; Inflammation; Vitamin B(1); Oxidative stress	RECEPTOR-MEDIATED EXCITOTOXICITY; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; GLIAL GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTERS; PYRITHIAMINE-INDUCED LESIONS; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; FREE-RADICAL PRODUCTION; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; RAT-BRAIN; ENERGY-METABOLISM; WHITE-MATTER	Thiamine deficiency (TD) is the underlying cause, and an established model, of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). Although the neurologic dysfunction and brain damage that results from TD has been well-described, the precise mechanisms that lead to the selective histological lesions characteristic of this disorder remain a mystery. Over the course of many years, various processes have been proposed that could lead to focal neuronal cell death in this disorder. But despite a concerted effort to relate these processes to a clear sequelae of events culminating in development of the focal neuropathology, little success has resulted. In recent years, however, a role for astrocytes in the pathophysiology of TD has been emerging. Here, alterations in glutamate uptake, and levels of the astrocytic glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2 in TD and WE, are discussed in terms of an excitotoxic event, along with the GABA transporter subtype GAT-3, and changes in other astrocytic proteins including GFAP and glutamine synthetase. Lactic acidosis, changes in the water channel protein AQP-4 and brain edema are also a focus of attention in relation to astrocyte dysfunction, while involvment of oxidative stress and inflammatory processes, along with white matter injury in terms of excitotoxicity are other key issues considered. In summary, a new appraisal of the extent of involvement of astrocytes in TD and WE is presented, with the evidence suggesting these cells represent a major target for damage during the disease process.

Biomechanical theories explain the origin of the BOLD undershoot through the passive ballooning of post-capillary vessels which leads to an increase in venous blood volume (CBV(v), comprising deoxygenated blood in capillary, venular and arteriolar compartments), resulting in susceptibility-induced signal decrease. While there has been substantial evidence supporting a role for venous ballooning, there have also been reports arguing for a prolonged post-stimulus elevation in cerebral oxygenation consumption (CMRo(2)) as the primary cause. Furthermore, a contribution of post-stimulus cerebral blood flow (CBF) undershoots has also been demonstrated. To clarify the role of the venous compartment in causing the BOLD undershoot, we performed in vivo fMRI measurements of the transient Delta CBV(v), Delta CBF and Delta BOLD responses in healthy humans. We observed a slow post-stimulus return to baseline in venous CBV which supports the existence of a passive "balloon" effect, implying that previous observations of a quicker recovery of the total CBV response may be dominated by arterial CBV change. Our findings also support a significant contribution from the CBF undershoots, which, combined with a slow venous CBV response, would account for Much of the BOLD undershoot. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Evaluation of 14 nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to human brain MRI registration	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							DIFFEOMORPHIC IMAGE REGISTRATION; NONRIGID REGISTRATION; INTERSUBJECT REGISTRATION; COORDINATE SYSTEM; CORTICAL SURFACE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SEGMENTATION; VALIDATION; LOCALIZATION; ATLAS	All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTELToolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTELToolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

Reading disorders in primary progressive aphasia: A behavioral and neuroimaging study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Exception words; Pseudo-words; Neurodegenerative diseases; Voxel-based morphometry	TEMPORAL-LOBE ATROPHY; ONSET ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; WORD FORM AREA; SEMANTIC DEMENTIA; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; SURFACE DYSLEXIA; DUAL-ROUTE; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; CORTICOBASAL DEGENERATION	Previous neuropsychological studies on acquired dyslexia revealed a double dissociation in reading impairments. Patients with phonological dyslexia have selective difficulty in reading pseudo-words, while those with surface dyslexia misread exception words. This double dissociation in reading abilities has often been reported in brain-damaged patients, but it has not been consistently shown in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated reading impairments and their anatomical correlates in various neurodegenerative diseases. First, we performed a behavioral analysis to characterize the reading of different word types in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Then, we conducted a voxel-based morphometry neuroimaging study to map the brain areas in which gray matter volume correlated with the accurate reading of exception and pseudo-words. The results showed a differential pattern of exception and pseudo-word reading abilities in different clinical variants of PPA. Patients with semantic dementia, a disorder characterized by selective loss of semantic memory, revealed a pattern of surface dyslexia, while patients with logo penic/phonological progressive aphasia, defined by phonological loop deficits, showed phonological dyslexia. Neuroimaging results showed that exception word reading accuracy correlated with gray matter volume in the left anterior temporal structures, including the temporal pole, the anterior superior and middle temporal and fusiform gyri, while pseudo-word reading accuracy correlated with left temporoparietal regions, including the posterior superior and middle temporal and fusiform gyri, and the inferior parietal lobule. These results suggest that exception and pseudo-word reading not only rely upon different language mechanisms selectively damaged in PPA, but also that these processes are sustained by separate brain structures.

We have previously shown that cultured oligodendrocytes are directly damaged by cadmium exposure. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanisms underlying cadmium-induced cell death in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLP). Cadmium caused a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability as assessed by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and by the cellular release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A short exposure (1 h) to cadmium (25-100 mu M), followed by several hours of recovery, produced a predominant apoptotic mechanism of cell death, involving the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway, as evidenced by nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, bax integration into the outer mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspases-9 and -3. Pretreatment of OLPs with the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, prevented caspase-3 activation but only slightly reduced cell death 11 h after cadmium exposure and failed to prevent cadmium-induced bax insertion into the mitochondrial membrane. In contrast, the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine blocked caspase-3 activation and significantly protected OLPs from cadmium-induced cell death. Continuous exposure (18-48 h) of OLPs to low micromolar concentrations (0.001-25 mu M) of cadmium significantly decreased mitochondrial metabolic activity, increased LDH leakage starting at 5 mu M and maximally activated caspase-3. These results suggest that cadmium induces OLP cell death mainly by apoptosis, and at higher concentrations or with prolonged exposure to the heavy metal there is an increase in cytoplasmic membrane damage, an index of necrosis. More importantly, transient exposure to cadmium is sufficient to damage OLPs and could in principle impair myelination in the neonate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Can loud noise cause acoustic neuroma? Analysis of the INTERPHONE study in France	OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							MOBILE PHONE USE; INDUCED HEARING-LOSS; OCCUPATIONAL NOISE; VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMAS; UNITED-STATES; RISK; EXPOSURE; DAMAGE; TELEPHONES; MENINGIOMA	Objectives: To investigate possible associations between risk of acoustic neuroma and exposure to loud noise in leisure and occupational settings. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in France within the international INTERPHONE study. The cases were the 108 subjects diagnosed with acoustic neuroma between 1 June 2000 and 31 August 2003. Two controls per case were selected from the electoral rolls and individually matched for gender, age (5 years) and area (local authority district) of residence at the time of the case diagnosis. Multivariate analyses were conducted using conditional logistic regression. Adjustment was made for socioeconomic status. Results: Acoustic neuroma was found to be associated with loud noise exposure (odds ratio (OR) = 2.55; 95% CI 1.35 to 4.82), both in leisure settings, particularly when listening to loud music (OR=3.88; 95% CI 1.48 to 10.17) and at work (OR = 2.26; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.72). This risk increased with exposure duration (>6 years' leisure exposure: OR = 3.15; 95% CI 1.07 to 9.24). Risk varied according to the type of noise (continuous or explosive vs intermittent). Conclusion: The present results agree with other recent reports implicating loud noise in the risk of acoustic neuroma.

Energy needs are difficult to define in this heterogeneous Population, and there is a lack of information on what normal growth should be in these children. Non-nutritional factors may influence growth, but nutritional factors such as insufficient caloric intake, excessive nutrient losses and abnormal energy metabolism also contribute to growth failure. Malnutrition is associated with significant morbidity, while nutritional rehabilitation improves overall health. Nutritional support should be an integral part of the management of neurologically impaired children, and should focus not only on improving nutritional status but also on improving quality of life for patients and their families. When considering nutritional intervention, oromotor dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux and Pulmonary aspiration Must be addressed and a Multidisciplinary team should be involved. Children at risk for nutrition-related problems should be identified early. An assessment of nutritional status should be performed at least yearly, and more frequently in infants and Young children, or in children at risk for malnutrition. Oral intake should be optimized if safe, but enteral tube feedings Should be initiated in children with oromotor dysfunction, leading to clinically significant aspiration, or in children unable to maintain an adequate nutritional status with oral intake. Nasogastric tube feeding Should be used for short-term intervention, but if long-term nutritional intervention is required, a gastrostomy Should be considered. Antireflux procedures should be reserved for children with significant gastroesophageal reflux. The patient's response to nutritional intervention should be carefully monitored to avoid excessive weight gain after initiation of enteral nutrition, and paediatric formulas Should be used to avoid micronutrient deficiencies.

We expanded and revised the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire(1) (SF-MPQ) pain descriptors by adding symptoms relevant to neuropathic pain and by modifying the response format to a 0-10 numerical rating scale to provide increased responsiveness in longitudinal studies and clinical trials. The reliability, validity, and subscale structure of the revised SF-MPQ (SF-MPQ-2(1)) were examined in responses from 882 individuals with diverse chronic pain syndromes and in 226 patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy who participated in a randomized clinical trial. The data Suggest that the SF-MPQ-2 has excellent reliability and validity, and the results of both exploratory and Confirmatory factor analyses provided Support for four readily interpretable subscales-continuous pain, intermittent pain, predominantly neuropathic pain, and affective descriptors. These results provide a basis for use of the SF-MPQ-2 in future clinical research, including clinical trials of treatments for neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain conditions.

Cerebellar Injury in Term Infants: Clinical Characteristics, Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings, and Outcome	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article							RISK-FACTORS; PREMATURE-INFANTS; PRETERM INFANTS; CHILDREN BORN; HEMORRHAGE; NEWBORN; AUTISM; BRAIN; PREVALENCE; DISORDERS	Although cerebellar injury in the premature infant is an increasingly recognized form of neonatal brain injury, its structural and functional outcomes remain poorly defined in the term infant. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to characterize the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging features and neurodevelopmental outcome in children, born at term, with cerebellar injury. Over a 5-year period, 20 infants were identified with ischemic (n = 3) or hemorrhagic (n = 17) cerebellar injury. Lesions were small (<1 cm) in 12 cases, and large in 8 cases. Prenatal and intrapartum factors frequently documented in term infants with cerebellar injury included primiparity (55%), advanced maternal age (30%), group B streptococcus-positive mothers (35%), abnormal fetal heart rate (35%), instrumented delivery (30%), and cesarean section (25%). At follow-up of 18 cases (median age, 32 months), 39% had neurologic abnormalities. Gross motor delays, expressive language deficits, and externalizing behavioral problems were the most common (44%). Cognitive deficits were present in one third of cases. Larger cerebellar lesions were associated with significantly lower cognitive, gross motor, expressive language, and social-behavioral scores.

Elevated Cerebral Pressure Passivity Is Associated With Prematurity-Related Intracranial Hemorrhage	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						prematurity; intraventricular hemorrhage; cerebral pressure passivity; transfer function analysis; cerebral autoregulation	BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; ARTERIAL-BLOOD-PRESSURE; PERIVENTRICULAR-INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGE; RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS SYNDROME; INTRA-VENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGE; PRETERM INFANTS; AUTOREGULATION DYNAMICS; FLOW VELOCITY; HEART-RATE; NEURODEVELOPMENT	OBJECTIVES: Cerebral pressure passivity is common in sick premature infants and may predispose to germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage (GM/IVH), a lesion with potentially serious consequences. We studied the association between the magnitude of cerebral pressure passivity and GM/IVH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled infants <32 weeks' gestational age with indwelling mean arterial pressure ( MAP) monitoring and excluded infants with known congenital syndromes or antenatal brain injury. We recorded continuous MAP and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy hemoglobin difference (HbD) signals at 2 Hz for up to 12 hours/day and up to 5 days. Coherence and transfer function analysis between MAP and HbD signals was performed in 3 frequency bands (0.05-0.25, 0.25-0.5, and 0.5-1.0 Hz). Using MAP-HbD gain and clinical variables ( including chorioamnionitis, Apgar scores, gestational age, birth weight, neonatal sepsis, and Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology II), we built a logistic regression model that best predicts cranial ultrasound abnormalities. RESULTS: In 88 infants (median gestational age: 26 weeks [range 23-30 weeks]), early cranial ultrasound showed GM/IVH in 31 ( 37%) and parenchymal echodensities in 10 (12%) infants; late cranial ultrasound showed parenchymal abnormalities in 19 (30%) infants. Low-frequency MAP-HbD gain (highest quartile mean) was significantly associated with early GM/IVH but not other ultrasound findings. The most parsimonious model associated with early GM/IVH included only gestational age and MAP-HbD gain. CONCLUSIONS: This novel cerebrovascular monitoring technique allows quantification of cerebral pressure passivity as MAP-HbD gain in premature infants. High MAP-HbD gain is significantly associated with GM/IVH. Precise temporal and causal relationship between MAP-HbD gain and GM/IVH awaits further study.

This communication was designed to investigate which neuropeptide and neurotransmitter are involved in AVP antinociception in the rat NRM. The results showed that (1) in the NRM perfuse liquid, pain stimulation could increase the concentrations of AVP, leucine-enkephalin (L-Ek), methionine-enkephalin (M-Ek), beta-endorphin (beta-Ep), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), but not change the concentrations of dynorphinA(1-13) (DynA(1-13)), oxytocin, achetylcholine, choline, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanilic acid, norepinephrine and epinephrine; (2) in the NRM perfuse liquid, AVP increased the concentrations of L-Ek, M-Ek, beta-Ep, DynA(1-13), 5-HT and 5-HIAA, but did not change the concentrations of oxytocin and the other studied neurotransmitters; (3) AVP antinociception in the NRM was attenuated by cypoheptadine (a 5-HT-receptor antagonist) or naloxone (an opiate receptor antagonist), but was not influenced by the other studied receptor antagonists. The data suggested that AVP antinociception in the NRM might be involved in endogenous opiate peptide and 5-HT system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Search for standard model Higgs boson production in association with a W boson using a neural network discriminant at CDF	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER; UPGRADE; DETECTOR; PHYSICS; TEV	We present a search for standard model Higgs boson production in association with a W boson in proton-antiproton collisions (pp ->(WH)-H-+/--> l nu bb) at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The search employs data collected with the CDF II detector that correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1.9 fb(-1). We select events consistent with a signature of a single charged lepton (e(+/-)/mu(+/-)), missing transverse energy, and two jets. Jets corresponding to bottom quarks are identified with a secondary vertex tagging method, a jet probability tagging method, and a neural network filter. We use kinematic information in an artificial neural network to improve discrimination between signal and background compared to previous analyses. The observed number of events and the neural network output distributions are consistent with the standard model background expectations, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction ranging from 1.2 to 1.1 pb or 7.5 to 102 times the standard model expectation for Higgs boson masses from 110 to 150 GeV/c(2), respectively.

In the present work, quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis for a set of 79 HEPT derivatives has been investigated by means of support vector machines. The relationships between structure and activity were examined quantitatively using descriptors encoding the steric, hydrophobic, electronic and structural features of 1-[2-hydroxyethoxy-methyl]-6-(phenylthio) thymine] derivatives. The performance and predictive capability of support vector machines method are investigated and compared with other methods such as artificial neural network and multiple linear regression methods. The obtained results indicate that the support vector machines model with the kernel radial basis function can be employed as a forceful tool for quantitative structure-activity relationship studies. The contribution of each descriptor to the structure-activity relationships was evaluated.

Using both questionnaire-based measures and laboratory REM sleep awakenings, we investigated dream content in 14 patients with schizophrenia (mean age = 25.5 +/- 3.2 years) under atypical antipsychotic medication and 15 healthy controls (mean age = 22.3 +/- 4.2 years). The relationship between eye movement density during REM sleep and dream content was also explored. Questionnaire data revealed that when compared to controls, patients with schizophrenia report experiencing a greater number of nightmares but no significant differences were found on other measures including overall dream recall, presence of recurrent dreams, and frequency of specific emotions. 39 dream reports were collected from each group following awakenings from REM sleep. Laboratory dream narratives from the patients were shorter and, after controlling for report length, most significant differences in dream content between the two groups disappeared with the exception of a greater proportion of unknown characters in the participant group. Patients with schizophrenia spontaneously rated their dream reports as being less bizarre than did controls, despite a similar density of bizarre elements as scored by external judges. Finally, both groups had a comparable density of rapid eye movements during REM sleep but a significant positive correlation between eye-movement density and dream content variables was only found in controls. Taken together. the findings suggest that dream content characteristics in schizophrenia may reflect neurocognitive processes, including emotional processing, specific to this disorder.

The SFAE and SAAE refer to the shifts observed in, respectively, the shape-frequency and shape-amplitude of a sinusoidal test contour following adaptation to a contour with different shape-frequency/shape-amplitude. We examined (i) the contribution of monocular versus binocular mechanisms to the SFAE and SAAE by measuring the interocular transfer of these after-effects, (ii) the stereo-depth selectivity of the after-effects and (iii) the depth selectivity of the reduction in the after-effects from texture-surround inhibition. Our results reveal that (i) both SFAE and SAAE have a high degree of interocular transfer (on average >90%), suggesting that they are mediated primarily by binocular mechanisms, (ii) neither SFAE nor SAAE are selective to stereo-defined depth and (iii) the reduction in the SFAE and SAAE from texture-surround inhibition is selective for stereo-depth. We conclude that the SFAE and SAAE are mediated by binocularly driven curvature-selective neurons that are not disparity selective in themselves but which receive inputs from neurons that are subject to depth- and orientation-selective texture-surround inhibition.

Subcellular Dynamics of Somatostatin Receptor Subtype 1 in the Rat Arcuate Nucleus: Receptor Localization and Synaptic Connectivity Vary in Parallel with the Ultradian Rhythm of Growth Hormone Secretion	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VESICULAR GABA TRANSPORTER; CELL-SURFACE RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEUS; CENTRAL NEURONS; SST2A RECEPTOR; MESSENGER-RNA; GH SECRETION; ADULT RATS; HYPOTHALAMUS	Growth hormone (GH) secretion in male rats exhibits a 3.3 h ultradian rhythm generated by the reciprocal interaction of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (SRIF). SRIF receptor subtypes sst(1) and sst(2) are highly expressed in GHRH neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). We previously demonstrated an ultradian oscillation in binding of SRIF analogs to the ARC in relation to GH peaks and troughs. Here we tested the hypothesis that these ultradian changes in SRIF binding are due to differential plasma membrane targeting of sst(1) receptors in ARC neurons using immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. We found that 87% of sst(1)-positive ARC neurons also synthesized GHRH. Subcellularly, 80% of sst(1) receptors were located intracellularly and 20% at the plasma membrane regardless of GH status. However, whereas 30% of the cell-surface sst(1) receptors were located perisynaptically or subsynaptically following exposure to high GH secretion, this fraction was increased to 42% following a GH trough period (p = 0.05). Furthermore, the relative abundance of symmetric and asymmetric synapses on sst(1)-positive dendrites also varied significantly, depending on the GH cycle, from approximately equal numbers following GH troughs to 70: 30 in favor of symmetric, i.e., inhibitory, inputs after GH peaks (p < 0.02). These findings suggest that postsynaptic localization of sst(1) receptors and synaptic connectivity in the ARC undergo pronounced remodeling in parallel with the GH rhythm. Such synaptic plasticity may be an important mechanism by which sst(1) mediates SRIF's cyclical effects on ARC GHRH neurons to generate the ultradian rhythm of GH secretion.

Critical to elucidating the underlying chemical mechanism behind these biological processes is the development of novel sensors and reporters with chemical sensitivity and, more importantly, molecular specificity, enabling the spatial and temporal monitoring of a specific ROS concentration in live cells. Here we report for the first time on the application of BODIPY-alpha-Tocopherol adduct (B-TOH), a novel lipophilic fluorescent antioxidant indicator, toward detection of peroxyl radicals in model lipid membranes and their imaging in the lipid membrane of live cells. Studies conducted in model lipid membranes show a 5-fold fluorescence enhancement upon reaction of liposome-embedded B-TOH with peroxyl radicals. The enhancement is independent of the solution pH and membrane composition. In studies in live cells performed under states of growth factor withdrawal and increased oxidative stress, a significant increase in B-TOH emission was also observed. Exogenous sources of free radicals were utilized herein, namely, N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride (also known as methyl viologen or paraquat) and uncoated nonemissive CdTe nanoparticles, a source of Cd(2+). The recorded fluorescence intensity of B-TOH was proportional to the concentration of the dye and to the level of cellular oxidative stress. By employing fluorescent dyes such as Lysotracker and Nile Red, we demonstrate the formation of peroxyl radicals in subcellular locations in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12 cells) and in primary mouse hippocampal neural cells under oxidative stress conditions. Specifically, we observed peroxyl radicals in lysosomes. The assessment of the subcellular distribution of B-TOH in living cells deprived from growth factors and/or under oxidative stress may be useful in the future in determining subcellular sites of lipid peroxidation. In summary, results from this study underscore the potential of B-TOH as a sensitive and specific probe enabling the molecular imaging of peroxyl radicals in the lipid membranes of live cells.

J	Corera, AT; Doucet, G; Fon, EA				Corera, Amadou T.; Doucet, Guy; Fon, Edward A.			Long-Term Potentiation in Isolated Dendritic Spines	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background: In brain, N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) receptor ( NMDAR) activation can induce long-lasting changes in synaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor (AMPAR) levels. These changes are believed to underlie the expression of several forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP). Such plasticity is generally believed to reflect the regulated trafficking of AMPARs within dendritic spines. However, recent work suggests that the movement of molecules and organelles between the spine and the adjacent dendritic shaft can critically influence synaptic plasticity. To determine whether such movement is strictly required for plasticity, we have developed a novel system to examine AMPAR trafficking in brain synaptosomes, consisting of isolated and apposed pre- and postsynaptic elements. Methodology/Principal Findings: We report here that synaptosomes can undergo LTP-like plasticity in response to stimuli that mimic synaptic NMDAR activation. Indeed, KCl-evoked release of endogenous glutamate from presynaptic terminals, in the presence of the NMDAR co-agonist glycine, leads to a long-lasting increase in surface AMPAR levels, as measured by [(3)H]-AMPA binding; the increase is prevented by an NMDAR antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5). Importantly, we observe an increase in the levels of GluR1 and GluR2 AMPAR subunits in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction, without changes in total AMPAR levels, consistent with the trafficking of AMPARs from internal synaptosomal compartments into synaptic sites. This plasticity is reversible, as the application of AMPA after LTP depotentiates synaptosomes. Moreover, depotentiation requires proteasome-dependent protein degradation. Conclusions/Significance: Together, the results indicate that the minimal machinery required for LTP is present and functions locally within isolated dendritic spines.

J	Il Kang, J; Vaucher, E				Il Kang, Jun; Vaucher, Elvire			Cholinergic Pairing with Visual Activation Results in Long-Term Enhancement of Visual Evoked Potentials	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Acetylcholine (ACh) contributes to learning processes by modulating cortical plasticity in terms of intensity of neuronal activity and selectivity properties of cortical neurons. However, it is not known if ACh induces long term effects within the primary visual cortex (V1) that could sustain visual learning mechanisms. In the present study we analyzed visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in V1 of rats during a 4-8 h period after coupling visual stimulation to an intracortical injection of ACh analog carbachol or stimulation of basal forebrain. To clarify the action of ACh on VEP activity in V1, we individually pre-injected muscarinic (scopolamine), nicotinic (mecamylamine), alpha 7 (methyllycaconitine), and NMDA (CPP) receptor antagonists before carbachol infusion. Stimulation of the cholinergic system paired with visual stimulation significantly increased VEP amplitude (56%) during a 6 h period. Pre-treatment with scopolamine, mecamylamine and CPP completely abolished this long-term enhancement, while alpha 7 inhibition induced an instant increase of VEP amplitude. This suggests a role of ACh in facilitating visual stimuli responsiveness through mechanisms comparable to LTP which involve nicotinic and muscarinic receptors with an interaction of NMDA transmission in the visual cortex.
