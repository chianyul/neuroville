The zebrafish is a leading model for studies of vertebrate development because one can obtain a large number of transparent, externally and rapidly developing embryos with motor behaviors that are easy to assess (e.g. for mutagenic screens). The emergence of embryonic motility was studied behaviorally and at the cellular level. The embryonic behaviors appear sequentially and include an early, transient period of spontaneous, alternating tail coilings, followed by responses to touch, and swimming. Patch clamp recording in vivo revealed that an electrically coupled network of a subset of spinal neurons generates spontaneous tail coiling, whereas a chemical (glutamatergic and glycinergic) synaptic drive underlies touch responses and swimming and requires input from the hindbrain. Swimming becomes sustained in larvae once serotonergic neuromodulatory effects are integrated. We end with a brief overview of the genetic tools available for the study of the molecular determinants implicated in locomotor network development in the zebrafish. Combining genetic, behavioral and cellular experimental approaches will advance our understanding of the general principles of locomotor network assembly and function. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Data sources: Papers (association/linkage, meta-analyses and animal model studies) were identified through searches of the PubMed database and systematically reviewed. Data synthesis: Consistent results from molecular genetic studies are pointing strongly to the possible link between 2 specific genes, the dopamine transporter (SLC3A6) and the dopamine receptor 4 (DRD4), and ADHD. Conclusions: The implication of SLC6A3 and DRD4 genes in ADHD appears to be one of the most replicated in psychiatric genetics and strongly suggests the involvement of the brain dopamine systems in the pathogenesis of ADHD. However, more work is required to further these findings by genotype-to-phenotype correlations and identify the functional allelic variants/mutations that are responsible for these associations. The role of other dopamine genes, which may have smaller effects than SLC6A3 and DRD4, needs also to be determined.

The approach proposed facilitates studying observed and unobserved sources of dependences among the event categories in the presence of possibly higher order autoregressive effects. In an investigation of the relationships between pleasant and unpleasant emotional experiences and the personality traits neuroticism and extraversion over time, we find that the two personality factors are related to both the mean rates of the emotional experiences and their carry-over effects. Respondents with high neuroticism scores not only reported more unpleasant than pleasant emotional experiences but also exhibited higher carry-over effects for unpleasant than for pleasant emotions. In contrast, respondents with high extraversion scores reported fewer anxiety and more euphoria emotions than respondents with low extraversion scores with weaker carry-over effects for both pleasant and unpleasant emotions.

This paper outlines one of the steps in the creation of a digital atlas intended for IGNS, using histological data. The acquisition of histological data can include artefacts such as tearing, shearing, stretching, shrinking, as well as inhomogeneous staining leading to structural inhomogeneities. These inconsistencies are reduced using a non-linear intensity based registration procedure where deformations are defined using a maximized correlation coefficient estimate. The intensity artefacts brought about by inhomogeneous staining are reduced by applying a slice to slice intensity inhomogeneity correction by modelling the intensity mapping between slices as a third order polynomial that is estimated with a Least Trimmed Squared fit. The lateral ventricle was then segmented and to demonstrate increased smoothing along its surface.

Working on a voxel-by-voxel basis, and considering that there is at most one such change-point in the time series of MR images, two complementary statistics are given, which aim at detecting disease activity. We show how to derive these statistics in a Neyman-Pearson framework, by computing ratios of data likelihood under null and alternative hypotheses. Preliminary results show that it is possible to detect both lesion activity and brain atrophy in this framework.

Although the somatotopy of the IC in individual patients is determined during their respective surgeries, quantitative analysis of somatotopic data from multiple subjects within a common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reference space has not been attempted. Here we describe a method for group analysis, in a single coordinate system, of responses obtained from the IC adjacent to the thalamus. We analyzed tongue, face, arm, and leg motor responses in 25 cases of thalamotomy. We used existing software to develop a three dimensional (31)) database of motor responses. Our preliminary analysis suggests a face-anterior to leg-posterior somototopic organization, with some overlap between adjacent representations.

These descriptors, which have been introduced more than a decade ago, are invariant relatively to rotations, symmetry and scale and can be computed for any topology. A rapid insight of the derivation of these invariants is proposed first. Then, their potential to characterize shapes is shown from a principal component analysis of the 12 first invariants computed for 12 different deep brain structures manually drawn from 7 different brains. Finally, these invariants are used to find some correlates of handedness among the shapes of 116 different cortical sulci automatically identified in 144 brains of the ICBM database.

Here, we present an automatic method for evaluating SPECT studies based on a computerized atlas of normal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). To generate the atlas, normal (screened volunteers) brain SPECT studies are registered with an affine transformation to one of them arbitrarily selected as reference to remove any size and orientation variations that are assumed irrelevant for our analysis. Then a smooth non-linear registration is performed to reveal the local activity pattern displacement among the normal subjects. By computing and applying the mean displacement to the reference SPECT image, one obtain the atlas that is the normal mean distribution of the rCBF (up to an affine transformation difference). To complete the atlas we add. the intensity variance with the displacement mean and variance of the activity pattern. To investigate a patient's condition, we proceed similarly to the atlas construction phase. We first register the patient's SPECT volume to the atlas with an affine transformation. Then the algorithm computes the non-linear 3D displacement of each voxel needed for an almost perfect shape (but not intensity) fit with the atlas. For each brain voxel, if the intensity difference between the atlas and the registered patient is higher than normal differences then this voxel is counted as "abnormal" and similarly if the 3D motion necessary to move the voxel to its registered position is not within the normal displacements. Our hypothesis is that this number of abnormal voxels discriminates between normal and abnormal studies. A Markovian segmentation algorithm that we have presented elsewhere is also used to identify the white and gray matters for regional analysis. We validated this approach using 23 SPECT perfusion studies (Tc-99m ECD) selected visually for clear diffuse anomalies (a much more stringent test than "easy" focal lesions detection) and 21 normal studies. A leave-one-out strategy was used to test. our approach to avoid any bias. Based on the number of "abnormal" voxels, two simple supervised classifiers were tested: (1) minimum distance-to-mean and (2) Bayesian. A voxel was considered "abnormal" if-its P value with respect to the atlas was lower that 0.01 (1%). The results show that for the whole brain, a combination of the number of intensity and displacement "abnormal" voxel is a powerful discriminant with a 91% classification rate. If we focus only on the voxels in the segmented gray matter the rates are slighty higher.

The gaze control system can be modeled using a feedback system in which an internally created instantaneous gaze position error signal equivalent to the distance between the target and the current gaze position is used to drive brainstem eye and head motor circuits. The visual axis is driven until this gaze position error (GPE) is zero. The neural structure of the feedback system is discussed here. The midbrain's superior colliculus (SC) is implicated in gaze control but its 'location' in the feedback circuitry is debated. Our moving hill hypothesis proposed that the SC is within the feedback loop and that GPE is encoded topographically by a moving locus of activity on the motor map. In cat, fixation neurons of the superior colliculus encode GPE, which supports this model. Our preliminary evidence in both monkey and cat shows that neurons on the motor map respond to and encode, at very short latency, gaze shift perturbations. This further supports the hypothesis that the SC is within the gaze feedback loop.

The absence of apoE correlates with diminished antioxidative capacity in animals, and elevated cerebral oxidative stress has been observed in AD individuals carrying the epsilon4 alleles. Nitric oxide (NO) is a neurosignaling molecule that has significant roles in cognition. NO has also been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases due to its oxidative properties. The current study examined the possible relationship between apoE and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by comparing hippocampal and cortical NOS activities in wild-type and apoE-knockout mice. Our results showed that apoE deficiency had no effect on NOS activity in these animals; however, aged animals uniformly exhibited significantly higher NOS activity levels. These findings suggest that increased NOS activity may contribute to cognitive impairments in aged wild-type and apoE-knockout mice due to excess accumulation of oxidative damages in areas involved in learning and memory.

WS people are also known to suffer from hyperacusis and to experience heightened emotional reactions to music and certain classes of noise. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural basis of auditory processing of music and noise in WS patients and age-matched controls and found strikingly different patterns of neural organization between the groups. Those regions supporting music and noise processing in normal subjects were found not to be consistently activated in the WS participants (e.g., superior temporal and middle temporal gyri). Instead, the WS participants showed significantly reduced activation in the temporal lobes coupled with significantly greater activation in the right amygdala. In addition,WS participants (bat not controls) showed a widely distributed network of activation in cortical and subcortical structures, including the brain stem, during music processing. Taken together with previous ERP and cytoarchitectonic studies, this first published report of WS using fMRI provides additional evidence of a different neurofunctional organization in WS people than normal people, which may help to explain their atypical reactions to sound. These results constitute an important first step in drawing out the links between genes, brain, cognition, and behavior in Williams syndrome. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

In order to evaluate the role of the NF2 gene in sporadic central nervous system (CNS) tumors, we analyzed NF2 mutations in 26 specimens: 14 meningiomas, 4 schwannomas, 4 metastases, and 4 other histopathological types of neo-plasms. Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (denaturing HPLC) and comparative genomic hybridization on a DNA microarray (microarray-CGH) were used as scanning methods for small mutations and gross rearrangements respectively. Small mutations were identified in six out of seventeen meningiomas and schwannomas, one mutation was novel. Large deletions were detected in six meningiomas. All mutations were predicted to result in truncated protein or in the absence of a large protein domain. No NF2 mutations were found in other histopathological types of CNS tumors. These results provide additional evidence that mutations in the NF2 gene play an important role in the development of sporadic meningiomas and schwannomas. Denaturing HPLC analysis of small mutations and microarray-CGH of large deletions are complementary, fast, and efficient methods for the detection of mutations in tumor tissues.

Evidence in support of a recent model proposed by Doyon and Ungerleider [Functional Anatomy of Motor Skill Learning. In: Squire LR, Schacter DL, editors. Neuropsychology of Memory. New York: Guilford Press, 2002.] is also discussed. The latter suggests that experience-dependent changes in the brain depend not only on the stage of learning, but also on whether subjects are required to learn a new sequence of movements (motor sequence learning) or learn to adapt to environmental perturbations (motor adaptation). This model proposes that the cortico-striatal and cortico-cerebellar systems contribute differentially to motor sequence learning and motor adaptation, respectively, and that this is most apparent during the slow learning phase (i.e. automatization) when subjects achieve asymptotic performance, as well as during reactivation of the new skilled behavior in the retention phase.

In addition, there is an absence of data concerning CVA patients' long-term abilities to process emotional information. Two groups of subjects with unilateral brain damage (15 RBD, 17 LBD), matched for chronicity (minimum 12 months post-CVA), etiology (ischemic CVA), duration of hospitalization and other variables, and an appropriate control group participated in two experiments to address these concerns. In the first experiment, subjects were given a series of tasks (discrimination, identification, imitation, production on request) to assess their processing of facial expressions of the six universal emotions [P. Ekman, W., Friesen, Unmasking the face, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1975]. The results showed that three emotions (surprise, happiness, fear) discriminate between RBD and LBD patients and controls, with RBD subjects performing worse than the other groups on the identification task only. Using tasks of the same nature, the second experiment investigated the processing of emotional prosody. The results showed that three emotions (fear, sadness, anger) discriminate between RBD and LBD patients and controls, with RBD subjects again performing worse than the others on the discrimination, imitation and production on request tasks. LBD subjects performed as well as normal controls on almost all tasks. The RBD subjects were the only ones who showed relatively consistent impairment in the processing of both facial and prosodic emotional information. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the right hemisphere is preferentially involved in processing emotional information in the chronic phase of brain damage.

However, clinical investigations of patients having undergone surgical callosal section have not shown neglect when the hemispheres are tested separately. These observations question the validity of theoretical models that propose a left hemispheric specialisation for attending to the right half of space. The present study aims to investigate neglect and the use of space by either hand in gestural demonstrations in three split-brain patients as compared to five patients with partial callosotomy and 11 healthy subjects. Subjects were asked to demonstrate with precise gestures and without speaking the content of animated scenes with two moving objects. The results show that in the absence of primary perceptual or representational neglect, split-brain patients neglect left personal space in right-handed gestural demonstrations. Since this neglect of left personal space cannot be explained by directional or spatial akinesia, it is suggested that it originates at the conceptual level, where the spatial coordinates for right-hand gestures are planned. The present findings are at odds with the position that the separate left hemisphere possesses adequate mechanisms for acting in both halves of space and neglect results from right hemisphere suppression of this potential. Rather, the results provide support for theoretical models that consider the left hemisphere as specialised for processing the right half of space during the execution of descriptive gestures.

It remains, however, unclear whether thalamic structures have specific roles in each of these functions. We tested 22 cases of thalamic infarction, proven with MR imaging, using experimental and established neuropsychological tests. We performed a lesion-overlap study in standardised stereotactic space of patients sharing a certain deficit, corrected for the lesion distribution of patients without such deficits and determined the regions of interest using an atlas of the human thalamus. We checked for additional, non-thalamic, damage and for deficient comprehension and perception that would preclude interpretation of the results. Non-thalamic damage such as white matter lesions, hippocampal atrophy, sulcal widening and infarctions occur significantly more often in patients aged over 60. The patients with additional damage overlapped to a major degree with those who showed loss of orientation, or lack of comprehension of the test requirements. In the 10 patients judged 'clean', we observed a deficit of episodic long-term memory with relative sparing of intellectual capacities and short-term memory when the mammillo-thalamic tract was damaged. Lesions including the medial dorsal nucleus, midline nuclei and/or intralaminar nuclei accompany executive dysfunctioning. Reduced simple processing speed and attention are associated with age, but not with a particular structure in the thalamus. Complex attention deficits follow damage to the intralaminar nuclei. We conclude that the analysis of structure-function relationships must take into account extra-structure damage which may explain cognitive deficits. Separate thalamic structures are involved in memory, executive functioning and attention. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In Experiment 1, the authors compared serial word recall with word recall in alphabetical order. Alphabetical recall requires the active manipulation of the contents of working memory. Findings indicated that DAT patients were severely impaired in the alphabetical recall task, whereas the performance of neurologically healthy elderly participants was comparable with the performance of young adult participants. In Experiment 2, the authors investigated the effect of different irrelevant auditory backgrounds on immediate digit recall. In this task, both elderly participants and DAT patients performed similarly to the group of young adult participants, indicating comparable efficacy to resist auditory distraction.

To understand the role of the OTR in the mouse brain we investigated the expression of the OTR gene at the cellular level. We targeted the lacZ reporter gene to the OTR gene locus downstream of the endogenous OTR regulatory elements. Using lactating mouse mammary gland as a control for OTR promoter directed specificity of lacZ gene expression, X-gal histochemistry on tissue sections confirmed that gene expression was restricted to the myoepithelial cells. We also identified for the first time in mice the expression of the OTR gene in neighbouring adipocytes. Further, investigation in the mouse brain identified numerous nuclei containing neurons expressing the OTR gene. Whilst some of these regions had been described for rat or sheep, the OTR-LacZ reporter mouse enabled the identification of novel sites of central OTR gene expression. These regions include the accessory olfactory bulb, the medial septal nucleus, the posterolateral cortical amygdala nucleus, the posterior aspect of the basomedial amygdala nucleus, the medial part of the supramammillary nucleus, the dorsotuberomammillary nucleus, the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices, as well as specific dorsal tegmental, vestibular, spinal trigeminal, and solitary tract subnuclei. By mapping the distribution of OTR gene expression, depicted through histochemical detection of P-galactosidase, we were able to identify single OTR gene expressing neurons and small neuron clusters that would have remained undetected by conventional approaches. These novel sites of OTR gene expression suggest additional functions of the oxytocinergic system in the mouse. These results lay the foundation for future investigation into the neural role of the OTR and provide a useful model for further study of oxytocin functions in the mouse. (C) 2003 IBRO.

Lesion experiments showed that the muscles of gill 1 are innervated by nerves VII (facial) and IX (glossopharyngeal), and those of gill 2 by nerve IX and the first branchial branch of nerve X (vagal). The other gills are supplied by the other branchial branches of nerve X. Retrograde tracers, injected in peripheral respiratory nerves, showed that branchial muscles are innervated by VII, IX and X motoneurons. Within the X nucleus, the motoneuron pools were branchiotopically organized, but with considerable rostro-caudal overlap. Electrophysiological recordings were used to show that the onset of activation of the branchial muscles was increasingly delayed with the distance from the brainstem, but that motoneuronal activity recorded with surface electrodes began at approximately the same time in all pools. The conduction velocity of VII and caudal X motor axons was found to be the same. Differences in the length of motoneuron axons appear to account for the rostro-caudal delay in gill contraction. The data presented here provide a much needed anatomical and physiological basis for further studies on the neural network controlling respiration in lampreys. (C) 2003 IBRO.

This deficit could be related to a reduction in the rate of proteolytic processing of peptide precursors. Since the two proprotein convertases (PC)1 and PC2 are responsible for the processing of neuropeptide precursors directed to the regulated secretory pathway, we examined whether they are involved first in the proteolytic processing of prosomatostatin in mouse and human brain and secondly in somatostatin defect associated with Alzheimer's disease. By size exclusion chromatography, the cleavage of prosomatostatin to somatostatin-14 is almost totally abolished in the cortex of PC2 null mice, while the proportions of prosomatostatin and somatostatin-28 are increased. By immunohistochemistry, PC1 and PC2 were localized in many neuronal elements in human frontal and temporal cortex. The convertases levels were quantified by Western blot, as well as the protein 782 which is required for the production of active PC2. No significant change in PC1 levels was observed in Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, a marked decrease in the ratio of the PC2 precursor to the total enzymatic pool was observed in the frontal cortex of Alzheimer patients. This decrease coincides with an increase in the binding protein 7B2. However, the content and enzymatic activity of the PC2 mature form were similar in Alzheimer patients and controls. Therefore, the cortical somatostatin defect is not due to convertase alteration occuring during Alzheimer's disease. Further studies will be needed to assess the mechanisms involved in somatostatin deficiency in Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It regulates iron metabolism and is involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and protection against oxidative stress. CP also modulates K+ channel activity in neuroblastoma cells and affects cardiodynamics of isolated hearts. Considering the presence of CP in the nervous system and the importance of iron ions and K+ channels in neuronal activity, we postulated a role of CP in neuronal development. This hypothesis was tested using the P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line, a model of neuronal differentiation. Addition of CP to the culture medium of newly differentiated P19 neurons induced cell aggregation within 24 h. This effect was concentration-dependent half-maximal at 50 nM, and not associated with necrosis, apoptosis or changes in secretory function. Deglycosylated CP was aggregative but not denatured CP, copper salts, His(2)Cu complex, or other copper enzymes or serum proteins. CP-induced aggregation was less pronounced with aging neurons and seemed not to involve K+ channels. Immunocytofluorescence analysis demonstrated that digoxigenin-labeled CP bound to P19 neurons and the proportion of responding neurons decreased with aging. The interaction of digoxigenin-labeled CP with neurons was half-maximal at 120 nM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and displaced by unlabeled CP. Our data indicate a specific aggregative action of CP on young neurons in vitro, possibly involving CP receptors. A potential developmental role of CP in nervous system organization is thus demonstrated. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Under conditions of constant darkness, these rhythms are maintained by the circadian pacemaker cells of the SCN [Bioessays 22 (2000) 23]. It is possible, however, that even in the absence of light, the eyes, which also contain autonomous circadian pacemakers [Science 272 (1996) 419; Chronobiol Int 16 (1999) 229], modulate circadian rhythms in the SCN. Indeed, it was shown recently that removal of the eyes abolishes an endogenous circadian rhythm within cells of the SCN [Nat Neurosci 6 (2003) 111], a finding that led to the suggestion that specific rhythms of the SCN are driven by input from the eyes. In contrast, we show here that removal of the eyes amplifies a normally dampened endogenous circadian rhythm within the SCN, indicating that the eyes can suppress the expression of specific rhythms within the SCN while promoting others.

The present study investigates the impact of amyloid plaques on synaptophysin and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) immunoreactive bouton numbers in the frontal cortex of the three transgenic mouse models previously described. When compared as a whole, the frontal cortices of transgenic and control mice show no observable differences in the densities of synaptophysin-immunoreactive boutons. An individual comparison of layer V of the frontal cortex, however, shows a significant increase in density in transgenic models. Analysis of the cholinergic system alone shows significant alterations in the VAChT-immunoreactive bouton densities as evidenced by an increased density in the single (APP(K670N,M671L)) transgenics and a decreased density in the doubly transgenics (APP(K670N,M671L) + PSIM146L). In investigating the impact of plaque proximity on bouton density at early stages of the amyloid pathology in our doubly (APP(K670N,M671L) + PSIM146L) transgenic mouse line, we observed that plaque proximity reduced cholinergic pre-synaptic bouton density by 40%, and yet increased synaptophysinimmunoreactive pre-synaptic bouton density by 9.5%. Distance from plaques (up to 60 mum) seemed to have no effect on bouton density; however a significant inverse relationship was visible between plaque size and cholinergic pre-synaptic bouton density. Finally, the number of cholinergic dystrophic neurites surrounding the truly amyloid, Thioflavin-S+ plaque core, was disproportionately large with respect to the incidence of cholinergic boutons within the total pre-synaptic bouton population. Confocal and electron microscopic observations confirmed the preferential infiltration of dystrophic cholinergic boutons into fibrillar amyloid aggregates. We therefore hypothesize that extracellular Abeta aggregation preferentially affects cholinergic terminations prior to progression onto other neurotransmitter systems. This is supported by the observable presence of non-cholinergic sprouting, which may be representative of impending neuritic degeneration. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

According to the differential emotions theory (DET), primary emotions are constituted of three distinct components: the neural-evaluative, the expressive, and the experiential. The DIET further assumes that these three components are biologically based and functional nearly from birth. Such a view entails that the neural substrate of primary emotions must be similar in children and adults. Guided by this assumption of the DET, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted to identify the neural correlates of sad feelings in healthy children. Fourteen healthy girls (aged 8-10) were scanned while they watched sad film excerpts aimed at externally inducing a transient state of sadness (activation task). Emotionally neutral film excerpts were also presented to the subjects (reference task). The subtraction of the brain activity measured during the viewing of the emotionally neutral film excerpts from that noted during the viewing of the sad film excerpts revealed that sad feelings were associated with significant bilateral activations of the midbrain, the medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area [BA] 10), and the anterior temporal pole (BA 21). A significant locus of activation was also noted in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 47). These results are compatible with those of previous functional neuroimaging studies of sadness in adults. They suggest that the neural substrate underlying the subjective experience of sadness is comparable in children and adults. Such a similitude provides empirical support to the DIET assumption that the neural substrate of primary emotions is biologically based. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bath application of the convulsant 4-aminopyridine (50 muM) to slices (n=12) with reciprocally connected areas, induced short-lasting interictal-like epileptiform discharges that (i) occurred at intervals of 1.2-2.8 s, (ii) originated in CA3, and (iii) spread to EC and BLA. Cutting the Schaffer collaterals abolished them in both parahippocampal areas where slower interictal-like (interval of occurrence=4-17 s) and prolonged ictal-like discharges (duration=15 +/- 6.9 s, mean +/- S.D., n=7) appeared. These new types of epileptiform activity originated in either EC or BLA. Similar findings were obtained in slices (n=19) in which the hippocampus outputs were not connected with the EC and BLA under control conditions. Cutting the EC-BLA connections made independent slow interictal- and ictal-like activities appear in both areas (n=5). NMDA receptor antagonism (n=6) abolished ictal-like discharges and reduced the duration of the slow interictal-like events. Repetitive stimulation of BLA at 0.5-1 Hz in Schaffer collateral cut slices, induced interictal-like epileptiform depolarizations in EC and reversibly blocked ictal-like activity (n=14). Thus, CA3 outputs in intact slices entrain EC and BLA networks into an interictal-like pattern that inhibits the propensity of these parahippocampal areas to generate prolonged ictal-like paroxysms. Accordingly, NMDA receptor-dependent ictal-like events are initiated in BLA or EC once the propagation of CA3-driven interictal-like discharges to these areas is abated by cutting the Schaffer collaterals. Similar inhibitory effects also occur by activating BLA outputs directed to EC at rates that mimic the CA3-driven interictal-like pattern. (C) 2003 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The peptide was first isolated from the porcine spinal cord and later shown to be present in spinal cords of other species. Little is known about the distribution of neuromedin U receptors (NMURs) in the spinal cord and the spinal action of the peptide. Here we report on the expression of NMURs and a potential role in nociception in the rat spinal cord using a combination of behavioral and electrophysiological studies. Receptor autoradiography showed that NMU-23 binding was restricted to the superficial layers of spinal cord, a region known to be involved in the control of nociception. In situ hybridization analysis indicated the mRNA of NMUR2 was located in the same region (laminae I and Ilo) as NMU-23 binding, while the mRNA for NMU receptor 1 was observed in a subpopulation of small diameter neurons of dorsal root ganglia. Intrathecal (i.t.) administration of neuromedin U-23 (0.4-4.0 nmol/10 mul) dose-dependently decreased both the mechanical threshold to von Frey hair stimulation and the withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus. Mechanical allodynia was observed between 10 and 120 min, peaking at 30 min and heat hyperalgesia was observed 10-30 min after i.t. administration of NMU-23. A similar mechanical allodynia was also observed following i.t. administration of NMU-8 (0.4-4 nmol/10 mul). A significant enhancement of the excitability of flexor reflex was induced by intrathecal administration of NMU-23 (4 nmol/10 mul). Evoked responses to touch and pinch stimuli were increased by 439+/-94% and 188+/-36% (P<0.01, n=6) respectively. The behavioral and electrophysiological data demonstrate, for the first time, a pro-nociceptive action of NMU. The restricted distribution of NMU receptors to a region of the spinal cord involved in nociception suggests that this peptide receptor system may play a role in nociception. (C) 2003 IBRO.

Its highly diverse biological activities are mediated via the G protein-coupled receptor that uniquely requires two accessory proteins for optimal function. CGRP receptor component protein (RCP) is a coupling protein necessary for CGRP-receptor signaling. In this study, we established the anatomical distribution of RCP in the rat central and peripheral nervous system and its relationship to CGRP immunoreactivity. RCP-immunoreactive (IR) perikarya are widely and selectively distributed in the cerebral cortex, septal nuclei, hippocampus, various hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala, nucleus colliculus, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nuclei, locus coeruleus, cochlear nuclei, dorsal raphe nuclei, the solitary tractus nucleus and gracile nucleus, cerebellar cortex, various brainstem motor nuclei, the spinal dorsal and ventral horns. A sub-population of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia were strongly RCP-IR. Overall, the localization of RCP-IR closely matched with that of CGRP-IR. We also determined whether RCP in DRG and dorsal horn neurons can be modulated by CGRP receptor blockade and pain-related pathological stimuli. The intrathecal injection of the antagonist CGRP(8-37) markedly increased RCP expression in the lumbar DRG and spinal dorsal horn. Carrageenan-induced plantar inflammation produced a dramatic bilateral increase in RCP expression in the dorsal horn while a partial sciatic nerve ligation reduced RCP expression in the ipsilateral superficial dorsal horn.

We used extra- and intracellular recordings in brain slices obtained from wild type and fragile X knockout mice to establish whether bath application of the cholinergic agent carbachol (5 muM) induces different responses in neurons of the subiculum, a limbic structure involved in learning and memory. We found that carbachol diminished excitatory post-synaptic responses induced by CA1 stratum radiatum stimulation in wild type mice, but caused an unexpected increase in knockout animals. Moreover, these responses augmented in knockout mice after carbachol washout, a phenomenon that resembled the muscarinic long-term potentiation seen in wild type mice during application of carbachol and GABA(A) receptor antagonists. We also used paired-pulse stimulation to determine whether the changes in synaptic excitability induced by carbachol were caused by pre- or post-synaptic mechanism. Under control conditions, this protocol induced facilitation in both wild type and knockout mice; in contrast, during carbachol application, this facilitatory effect was seen in wild type mice only. In conclusion, our data highlight for the first time differences in cholinergic and GABA-ergic mechanisms that may contribute to the phenotype of fragile X patients. (C) 2003 IBRO.

Our previous studies have revealed that chronic infusion of neurotrophins can regulate not only seizure development, but also these kindling-induced structural changes. Kindling, in turn, can alter the expression of neurotrophins and their receptors. We previously showed that intraventricular administration of a synthetic peptide that interferes with nerve growth factor stability and thus its binding to TrkA and p75(NTR) receptors suppressed kindling and sprouting. However, the precise involvement of TrkA, p75(NTR), and downstream signaling effectors of neurotrophins on kindling, sprouting and hilar changes are unknown. One of these downstream effectors is Ras. In the present study, we find that intraventricular infusion of the synthetic peptide Reo3Y, which binds to p65/p95 receptors and causes a rapid inactivation of Ras protein, impairs development of perforant path kindling, reduces the growth in afterdischarge duration, blocks kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting in area CA3 of hippocampus and in inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and prevents kindling-induced increases in hilar area. These results are consistent with a mediation of neurotrophin effects on kindling, hilar area, and axonal sprouting via Trk receptors, and suggest important roles for Ras in kindling and in kindling-induced structural changes.

J	Moroz, IA; Rajabi, H; Rodaros, D; Stewart, J				Moroz, IA; Rajabi, H; Rodaros, D; Stewart, J			Effects of sex and hormonal status on astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor-2 and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity after medial forebrain bundle 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the midbrain dopamine neurons	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						6-OHDA; FGF-2; estrogen; testosterone; midbrain dopaminergic neurons; substantia nigra; VTA	MPTP-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY; INDUCED LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; ADULT FEMALE RATS; STRIATAL DOPAMINE; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; IN-VIVO; INTRASTRIATAL 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE; TIME-COURSE; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION	We examined astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor immunoreactivity (FGF-2-IR) and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-IR) in the cell-body region of midbrain dopaminergic neurons after unilateral infusions of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine into the medial forebrain bundle in male and female rats. In addition, to determine whether neonatal exposure to gonadal hormones has consequences on the expression of astrocytic FGF-2 and cell loss in response to injury in adulthood, we studied the effects of these lesions in adult male and female rats that had been exposed or not to testosterone in the neonatal period. In both males and females there was a progressive loss of TH-expressing cells that peaked 5 weeks after the lesions. Females showed less loss of TH-expressing cells than males, but this effect was not estrogen dependent. Lesions led to an increase in expression of astrocytic FGF-2 that was greater in males than in females. Finally, it was found that, regardless of genetic sex, rats exposed to testosterone neonatally showed greater astrocytic FGF-2 expression after lesions than those not exposed, and that among those not exposed to testosterone, estrogen treatment had a modest protective effect. Analysis of behavior and striatal dopamine content showed that the percent of striatal dopamine depletion 14 days after the lesion correlated with the amount of behavioral asymmetry displayed by animals on all tests conducted after lesioning. In groups killed 2 and 5 weeks after the lesion, the amount of behavioral asymmetry correlated with the percent loss of TH-IR cells and with the percent increase in FGF-2-IR cells in the midbrain. These relationships were not evident in groups killed 3 and 7 days after the lesion, possibly because the changes in the number of FGF-2- and TH-IR cells were not fully manifested. dThe present findings show that hormonal events early in life can alter the response of midbrain dopamine neurons to insult and injury in adult life and suggest that the slow degeneration of these neurons may release signals triggering a sustained activation of adjacent astrocytes which, in turn, may lead to induction of astrocytic FGF-2.

The neuritic plaques, abundantly localized in. the hippocampus and anterior neocortical areas, showed a core devoid of enzymatic activity surrounded by higher cytochrome oxidase activity at the sites of the dystrophic neurites and activated glial cells. Quantitative measures, taken only in the healthy-appearing regional areas without neuritic plaques, were higher in numerous limbic and non-limbic regions of transgenic mice in comparison with controls. Enzymatic activity was higher in the dentate gyrus and CA2-CA3 region of the hippocampus, the anterior cingulate and primary visual cortex, two olfactory structures, the ventral part of the neostriatum, the parafascicularis nucleus of the thalamus, and the subthalamic nucleus. Brainstem regions anatomically related with altered forebrain regions were more heavily labeled as well, including the substantia nigra, the perlaqueductal gray, the superior colliculus, the medial raphe, the locus coeruleus and the adjacent parabrachial nucleus, as well as the Pontine nuclei, red nucleus, and trigeminal motor nucleus. Functional brain organization is discussed in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Although hypometabolism is generally observed in this pathology, the increased cytochrome oxidase activity obtained in these transgenic mice can be the result of a functional compensation on the surviving neurons, or of an early mitochondrial alteration related to increased oxidative damage.

We compared the effects of acetylcholine (Ach) on neocortical field potential responses evoked by stimulation of the whiskers and by local electrical stimulation in the upper layers of the neocortex vibrissae representation ("barrel cortex") of adult rats anesthetized with urethane. In the barrel cortex, the cholinergic system was manipulated using microdialysis by exogenous application of Ach, by increasing the endogenous levels of Ach with physostigmine and by applying specific cholinergic agonists. The results revealed that Ach selectively enhances the sensory response relative to the intracortical response. Thus, pathways in the barrel cortex are differentially regulated by cholinergic inputs.

Previous studies have demonstrated that both estrous odors and initially neutral odors paired with copulation influence the sexual behavior of male rats. The present study examines the pattern of neural activation as revealed by Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) following exposure to bedding scented with either a neutral odor (almond) paired previously with copulation, estrous odors or no odor. Following exposure to estrous odors Fos-IR increased in the accessory olfactory bulb, medial amygdala, medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial preoptic area, ventromedial hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and both the nucleus accumbens core and shell. Conversely, following exposure to the sexually conditioned odor Fos-IR increased in the piriform cortex, basolateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens core, and the anterior portion of the lateral hypothalamic area. In addition, following exposure to almond odor Fos-IR increased in the main olfactory bulb independent of its pairing with copulation. These patterns of Fos-IR following exposure to estrous or sexually conditioned odors were not influenced by either the addition or omission of the other type of odor. These findings demonstrate that estrous and sexually conditioned odors are processed by distinct neural pathways and converge in the nucleus accumbens core, suggesting that this structure has a unique role in processing sexual stimuli of both pheromonal and olfactory natures.

J	Dyer, JR; Manseau, F; Castellucci, VF; Sossin, WS				Dyer, JR; Manseau, F; Castellucci, VF; Sossin, WS			Serotonin persistently activates the extracellular signal-related kinase in sensory neurons of Aplysia independently of camp or protein kinase C	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						signal transduction; long-term facilitation; excitability; MAP kinases; learning and memory; diacylglycerol	LONG-TERM FACILITATION; MAP KINASE; PRESYNAPTIC FACILITATION; SENSORIMOTOR SYNAPSES; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; PATHWAY; HYPEREXCITABILITY; PHOSPHORYLATION; EXPRESSION; TRANSIENT	Activation of the extracellular signal-related kinase is important for long-term increases in synaptic strength in the Aplysia nervous system. However, there is little known about the mechanism for the activation of the kinase in this system. We examined the activation of Aplysia extracellular signal-related kinase using a phosphopeptide antibody specific to the sites required for activation of the kinase. We found that phorbol esters led to a prolonged activation of extracellular signal-related kinase in sensory cells of the Aplysia nervous system. Surprisingly, inhibitors of protein kinase C did not block this activation. Serotonin, the physiological transmitter involved in long-term synaptic facilitation, also led to prolonged activation of extracellular signal-related kinase, but inhibitors of protein kinase A or protein kinase C did not block this activation. We examined whether the protein synthesis-dependent increase in excitability stimulated by phorbol esters was dependent on phorbol ester activation of extracellular signal-related kinase, but increases in excitability were still seen in the presence of inhibitors of extracellular signal-related kinase activation. Our results suggest that prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase in the Aplysia system is not mediated by either of the classic second messenger activated kinases in this system, protein kinase A or protein kinase C and that extracellular signal-related kinase is not important for phorbol ester induced long-term effects on excitability.

Epidemiological studies have implicated perinatal insults, particularly obstetric complications involving fetal or neonatal hypoxia, as etiological risk factors for schizophrenia. This suggests the possibility that perinatal hypoxia might have lasting effects on dopaminergic function. In animal models, dopaminergic systems appears to be particularly vulnerable to a wide range of perinatal insults, resulting in persistent alterations in function of mesolimbic and mesostriatal pathways. This review summarizes recent work characterizing long-term changes in dopaminergic function and biochemistry in models of Caesarean section (C-section) birth and of C-section birth with added global anoxia in the rat and guinea pig. C-section birth and C-section with anoxia appear to be two distinct hypoxic birth insults, with somewhat differing patterns of lasting effects on dopamine systems. In addition, birth insult alters the manner in which dopaminergic function is regulated by stress at adulthood. The possible relevance of these finding to effects of human birth procedures is discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three different sets of issues are described. First, studies dealing with the brain correlates of musical imagery are discussed. This topic is of interest in that it illustrates how subjective sensations may be studied via objective techniques, and gives insight into neural systems associated with internal phenomena. Second, some findings pertaining to absolute pitch are presented. Absolute pitch is a useful example of a highly specific cognitive skill that is unevenly distributed in the population. Examination of its neural basis helps to understand aspects of memory function and points to ways to explore individual differences in brain organization that underlie differential skills. The final topic, music and emotion, has not been the subject of much systematic research, but it is of great interest because it intersects with a large literature on the neuroscience of affective processing. Findings from some studies indicate that music may engage systems concerned with biological reward, raising interesting but so far unanswered questions about the broader role of music in human experience.

Conversely, early brain anomalies or vast brain injuries may sometimes spare ordinary musical skills in individuals who experience severe cognitive losses. To document these incidences, comprehensive behavioral testing is required. We propose to use the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA) because it is arguably the best tool currently available. Over the last decade, this battery was developed and validated in populations with brain damage of various etiologies. Furthermore, the MBEA is theoretically motivated and satisfies important psychometric properties. It is sensitive, normally distributed, reliable on test-retest, and correlates with Gordon's Musical Aptitude Profile, another more widely used battery of tests. To promote its wide usage, the MBEA is now available upon request. In addition, individual MBEA data of 160 normal participants of variable age and education have been made available to all via the internet.

J	Feindel, W				Feindel, W			Harvey Cushing's Canadian connections	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Edward Archibald; Harvey Cushing; Kenneth McKenzie; McGill Medical School; Montreal Neurological Institute; Osler Library; Wilder Penfield		DURING HIS SURGICAL career between 1896 and 1934, Harvey Cushing made eight visits to Canada. He had a broad impact on Canadian medicine and neurosurgery. Cushing's students Wilder Penfield and Kenneth McKenzie became outstanding leaders of the two major centers in Canada for neurosurgical treatment and training. On his first trip to Canada, shortly after completing his surgical internship in August 1896, Cushing traveled with members of his family through the Maritime Provinces and visited hospitals in Quebec and Montreal. Eight years later, in February 1904, as a successful young neurosurgeon at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, he reported to the Montreal Medico-Chirurgical Society on his surgical experience in 20 cases of removal of the trigeminal ganglion for neuralgia. In 1922, as the Charles Mickle Lecturer at the University of Toronto, Cushing assigned his honorarium of $1000 to support a neurosurgical fellowship at Harvard. This was awarded to McKenzie, then a general practitioner, for a year's training with Cushing in 1922-1923. McKenzie returned to initiate the neurosurgical services at the Toronto General Hospital, where he developed into a master surgeon and teacher. On Cushing's second visit to McGill University in October 1922, he and Sir Charles Sherrington inaugurated the new Biology Building of McGill's Medical School, marking the first stage of a Rockefeller-McGill program of modernization. In May 1929, Cushing,attended the dedication of the Osler Library at McGill. In September 1934, responding to the invitation of Penfield, Cushing presented a Foundation Lecture-one of his finest addresses on the philosophy of neurosurgery-at the opening of the Montreal Neurological Institute. On that same trip, Cushing's revisit to McGill's Osler Library convinced him to turn over his own treasure of historical books to Yale University.

Estimates range from 1 day to 2 weeks, 7 days probably being the criterion standard. The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate how much the 7-day period could be shortened without compromising the reliability of data. Methods: Various lengths of frequency-volume (FV) charts (from 1 day to 6 days) were compared with the standard 7-day charts on 14 FV parameters. Results: Overall results show that a 4-day dairy is nearly identical to the 7-day chart (most r greater than or equal to 0.95). Results of the 1-, 2-, and 3-day charts were frequently different statistically from the 7-day chart, whereas comparison of the 4-day chart with the 7-day chart showed no statistically significant differences. In addition, results of 4-day FV charts from a new control cohort showed no significant differences from the 7-day charts of the main cohort. Conclusions: In conclusion, our study indicates that the 4-day chart is as reliable as the 7-day chart. This reduction in the length of time, although easier for the patients, does not compromise the diagnostic value of the FV charts. Neurourol Urodynam. 22:92-96, 2003, (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Patients and Methods: We selected 255 patients aged 20 years and older, with a stable bladder on multichannel urodynamics, without known neurological pathology, and without a history of pelvic or anti-incontinence surgery. A resting urethral pressure profile and the degree of urethral hypermobility were registered. Two-tailed analyses of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher's post-hoc tests were used to detect any statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in urethral closure pressure between groups with varying degrees of urethral hypermobility. Results: Mean age was 45.6 &PLUSMN; 12.7 (range 20-77) years. Mean maximum urethral closure pressure for the entire group was 62.7 &PLUSMN; 29 (range 10-150) cm of water. A statistically significant inverse relationship was found between age and maximum urethral closure pressure (r = 0.489, P < 0.0001) when both analyzed as continuous variables, and with age categorized in 10-year increments (P < 0.0001). When comparing mean urethral closure pressure in each group examined for urethral hypermobility, a statistically significant difference was noted when grades I, II, and III were compared to grade 0 hypermobility. No significant difference was observed when grades I, II, and III were compared to each other. Even if statistically non-significant, there exists an inverse relationship between the degree of urethral hypermobility and the maximum urethral closure pressure: a higher hypermobility is associated with a lesser urethral closure pressure. Conclusions: Urethral closure pressure falls significantly when urethral hypermobility is present. This decrease is not related to patient's age or parity. Our observations demonstrate an inverse relation between urethral closure pressure and the degree of cysto-urethrocele. As hypermobility increases, closure pressure decreases, even if this decrease does not reach the level of statistical significance.

Our aim was to standardize an animal model that can be useful in studying this condition. After standardizing the animal model in a pilot study, 26 female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to spinal cord transection at the level of T10 vertebra. Four animals were subjected to cystometrogram (CMG) 24 hr after spinalization and six rats 3 weeks post-spinalization. These CMGs were compared to that of six normal controls. The detailed description of the model presented in this manuscript, is the final result after several modifications. All the animals consistently developed hyperreflexia after an initial period of spinal shock phase. Expressed volume of urine continued to decrease until it reached a plateau after peaking at 1-week post-spinalization. The attrition rate reached 27.3% after several improvements in the animal model and was mostly from self-inflicted injuries. Post-operative complications included hypothermia, decubitus ulcers, hematuria, urinary tract infection in addition to the unexplained death of two animals. In conclusion, we believe that this animal model closely resembles the clinical condition of hyperreflexia and follows similar course. The relative low cost of this animal model and the easy maintenance makes it a valuable tool to study such a condition.

We can regard the image values, sampled at up to 500,000 voxels, as a very high dimensional multivariate observation, but a better approach is to model them as a continuous function or random field. The result of the statistical analysis is an image of test statistics, and our main interest is how to deal with them. We use a topological quantity, the Euler characteristic of the excursion set of a random field, as a tool to test for localised changes. The data is highly non-isotropic, that is, the effective smoothness is not constant across the image, so the usual random field theory does not apply. We propose a solution that warps the data to isotropy using local multidimensional scaling. Recent theoretical work has shown that the subsequent corrections to the random field theory can be done without actually doing the warping (Taylor and Adler, 2002). We shall apply these methods to a set of 151 brain images from the Human Brain Mapping data base.

A new algorithm, knowledge-based cascade-correlation (KBCC), finds, adapts, and uses its relevant knowledge to speed learning. We demonstrate its performance on small, clear problems involving decisions about whether a two-dimensional input falls within a nonlinear distribution of a particular size, shape, and location. Relevance of prior knowledge to a new, target problem was implemented by systematic variations in the width of the distribution space. The more relevant the prior inexact knowledge was, the more likely that KBCC recruited it for solution of the target problem and the faster that new learning was.

In fact, a well designed OO software must be able to evolve without violating the compatibility among versions, provided that no major requirement reshuffling occurs. Stability, like most quality factors, is a complex phenomenon and its prediction is a real challenge. In this paper we present an approach which relies on the case-based reasoning (CBR) paradigm and thus overcomes the handicap of insufficient theoretical knowledge on stability. The approach explores structural similarities between classes, expressed as software metrics, to guess their chances of becoming unstable. In addition, our stability model binds its value to the impact of changing requirements, i.e., the degree of class responsibilities increase between versions, quantified as the stress factor As a result, the prediction mechanism favours the stability values for classes having strong structural analogies with a given test class as well as a similar stress impact. Our predictive model is applied on a testbed made up of the classes from four major version of the Java API.

Design: Prospective, nonrandomized, self-controlled trial. Participants: Twenty patients with OAG and 20 patients with OHT with clinical indications for therapeutic IOP reduction were prospectively enrolled. Intervention: IOP reduction was achieved by medical, laser, or surgical therapy. All patients had IOP reductions more than 20% and a minimum of 4 weeks follow-up. Main Outcome Measures: Blood flow measurements were performed by SLDF analysis software (version 3.3) using Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter images. Statistical evaluations were performed on both groups using a two-tailed distribution paired t test. Results: Twenty patients with OAG had a mean IOP reduction of 37% after treatment. In these patients, mean (+/- standard deviation) rim blood flow increased by 67% (from 158 +/- 79 arbitrary units to 264 +/- 127 arbitrary units, P = 0.001), whereas mean temporal peripapillary retinal flow decreased by 7.4% (P = 0.24), and mean nasal peripapillary retinal flow increased by 0.3% (P = 0.96). Twenty OHT patients had a mean IOP reduction of 33% after treatment. In contrast to the OAG group, neither the mean rim blood flow (7.5% increase from 277 +/- 158 arbitrary units to 298 +/- 140 arbitrary units, P = 0.41) nor the mean temporal (P = 0.35) or nasal (P = 0.88) peripapillary retinal flow changed significantly. Conclusions: For a similar percentage of IOP reduction, OAG patients had a statistically significant improvement of blood flow in the neuroretinal rim of the ONH, whereas OHT patients did not demonstrate such a change. Peripapillary retinal blood flow, expected to be affected less in glaucoma, remained stable in both groups. In addition to indicating a response to therapy in OAG patients, the reported changes in rim perfusion suggest that ONH autoregulation may be defective in OAG while intact in OHT.

However, few data exist regarding delta opioid receptor expression and localization in such conditions. In this study, we have assessed the distribution and function of delta opioid receptors in the rat spinal cord following induction of chronic inflammation by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Intrathecal administration of the selective delta opioid receptor agonist, D-[Ala(2), Glu(4)] deltorphin, dose-dependently reversed thermal hyperalgesia induced by CFA. In situ hybridization and Western blotting experiments revealed an increase in delta opioid receptor mRNA and protein levels, respectively, in the dorsal lumbar spinal cord ipsilateral to the CFA injection site compared to the contralateral side and sham-injected controls. By electron microscopy, immunopositive delta opioid receptors were evident in neuronal perikarya, dendrites, unmyelinated axons and axon terminals. Quantification of immunopositive signal in dendrites revealed a twofold increase in the number of immunogold particles in the ipsilateral dorsal spinal cord of CFA-injected rats compared to the contralateral side and to sham-injected rats. Moreover, the relative frequency of immunogold particles associated with or in close proximity to the plasma membrane was increased in the ipsilateral dorsal spinal cord, indicating a more efficient targeting of delta opioid receptors to neuronal plasma membranes. These data demonstrate that CFA induces an up-regulation and increased membrane targeting of delta opioid receptors in the dorsal spinal cord which may account for the enhanced antinociceptive effects of delta opioid receptor agonists in chronic inflammatory pain models.

Activation of a neural network unit trained to respond to anomalous faces predicted impressions of normal adult faces varying in attractiveness as well as several elderly stereotypes. Activation of a neural network unit trained to respond to babies' faces predicted impressions of adults varying in babyfaceness as well as I elderly stereotype. Thus, similarities of normal adult faces to anomalous faces or babies' faces contribute to impressions of them quite apart from knowledge of overlapping social stereotypes. The evolutionary importance of appropriate responses to unfit individuals or babies is presumed to produce a strong response preparedness that is overgeneralized to faces resembling the unfit or babies.

In the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), there is a need to tune the gain of the reflex separately for each eye with head perturbations, depending on the distance and eccentricity of a visual target from the midsaggital plane of the head. The natural structural symmetry of the ocular premotor circuits can imbed the required changes in simultaneous vergence and conjugate components of the binocular VOR system. Here we demonstrate that including simple non-linearities on the function of premotor cells in this symmetric circuit achieves the desired context-dependence for the binocular VOR. This approach allows very complex behaviors in response to sensory patterns without resorting to currently assumed complex cortical computations. The local premotor topology with its non-linear properties can be sufficient for on-line reflex adaptation to behavioral context in the ocular system and has implications for other motor systems (such as stretch reflex modulation during rhythmic walking).

The correct inverse dipole parameters are those that minimize the difference between measured scalp potentials and corresponding theoretical potentials generated by the inverse dipole in a numerical head model. Performance characteristics of the simplex algorithm often used to effect this minimization were investigated in simulation studies employing the three-concentric-spheres head model. A position constraint restricting inverse solutions to the brain region was utilized with the simplex algorithm. It is shown that this algorithm is surprisingly robust even in the presence of large errors in the forward transfer matrix used to compute theoretical potentials.

One of the major obstacles is to make existing microelectrode arrays much less invasive. In this aim, novel approaches for the implementation of these microelectrode arrays will be required. This paper suggests the use structurally bi-stable electrodes based on deployable microstructures which minimize the overall dimensions during insertion into the cortex and then deploy to increase the recording surface and lower the electrical impedance. Other design alternatives and issues such as new methods of implantation, tracking, and additional features that could make microelectrodes less invasive are also briefly described.

It has been suggested that synchronization, of action potentials between neurons may be an encoding process, which allows the link-age of various features of a visual object. Our investigations are aimed at clarifying the processes leading to the formation of encoding assemblies by synchronization. We investigated the modulation of synchronization between pairs of neurons (SUA) sorted out from MUA in areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats, in relation to target structures. We measured the relative strength of synchronization between groups of paired cells in response to each target structure and compared this value with synchronization modulations measured in MUA for identical stimuli configurations. An hypothesis is proposed to explain the formation of neuronal encoding assembly.

ASK modulation/demodulation is commonly used by IED when transmitting data witch is usually carried out using remote transmission systems. The proposed ASK demodulator is designed to process input currents with a very small modulation depth (the difference between the two allowable amplitude levels of the ASK modulated input current). The demodulator is designed with Cadence CAD tools and Specter simulator using 0.18 mu m, 1.8 V CMOS technology process. Preliminary post-layout simulation results are promising and the circuit is now under fabrication process.

The algorithm adds hidden units as in standard CC, and removes unimportant connections by using Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) in both the input and output phases of CC. To this purpose, OBD was adapted to prune weights according to the two separate objective functions that are used in CC to train the candidate hidden units and to train the network, respectively. Application of the new algorithm to two databases of the PROBEN1 benchmarks reveals that this new dual-phase pruning technique is effective in significantly reducing the size of CC networks, while providing a speed-up in learning times and improvements in generalization over novel test sets.

A smaller proportion of young adults with schizophrenia currently had a sexual partner or had ever engaged in sexual relations. They also had sexual relations and sexual desires less often. Whether affected by schizophrenia or not, a smaller proportion of women had ever masturbated, and a smaller proportion of men currently had a sexual partner. Women masturbated less often, felt less sexual desire, and desired sexual relations less often, compared with men. Proportionally more men with schizophrenia treated with risperidone or olanzapine than men in the comparison group had at least one sexual dysfunction, lacked sexual desire, and reported problems with sexual arousal and ejaculation. Women with schizophrenia were more likely to report problems with sexual arousal and galactorrhea, compared with women in the comparison group. Finally, young adults with schizophrenia were more likely to develop negative psychological tendencies associated with sexuality than were young adults in the comparison group. Sexual problems are highly prevalent among young adults with schizophrenia. Sexuality should occupy the space it deserves within psychosocial rehabilitation programs and the treatment of schizophrenia.

In this paper we present an ensemble feature selection approach based on a hierarchical multi-objective genetic algorithm. The first level performs feature selection in order to generate a set of good classifiers while the second one combines them to provide a set of powerful ensembles. The proposed method is evaluated in the context of handwritten digit recognition, using three different feature sets and neural networks (MLP) as classifiers.

Amplitude modulation thresholds were measured for the discrimination of the direction of motion (up vs. down) for luminance-modulated (first-order) and contrast-modulated (second-order) horizontal sine-wave gratings. At the slower velocity (1.5degrees s(-1)), the differences in threshold between 5-year-olds and adults were small but significant for both first- and second-order stimuli (0.02 and 0.05 log units worse than adults' thresholds, respectively). However, at the faster velocity (6degrees s(-1)), the differences in threshold between the children and adults were 8 times greater for second-order motion than for first-order motion. Specifically, children's thresholds were 0.16 log units worse than those of adults for second-order motion compared to only 0.02 log units worse for first-order motion. The different pattern of results for first-order and second-order motion at the faster velocity (6degrees s(-1)) is consistent with models positing different mechanisms for the two types of motion and suggests that those mechanisms mature at different rates.

Several previous studies have reported increases in ODC activity in tissues of rats exposed to 60 Hz magnetic fields. The goals of this study were to confirm these findings and to determine whether ODC activity is increased in tissues of animals exposed to magnetic fields containing complex metrics. Three experiments were conducted in male F344 rats. Each study included a sham control group and a group exposed to pure continuous 60 Hz fields (0.2 mT). Additional groups included animals exposed to randomly time-varying 60 Hz fields (range of 0.02 to 0.2 mT); intermittent 60 Hz fields (2 mT) with on-off cycles ranging from 5 s to 5 min; pure continuous 180 Hz fields (2 mT); 60 Hz fields with a superimposed 3rd harmonic (total field strength, 2 mT); 60 Hz fields with superimposed third, fifth, and seventh harmonics (total field strength, 2 mT); 60 Hz fields (2 mT) with superimposed transients; and randomly time-varying 60 Hz fields (range of 0.02 to 0.2 mT) with superimposed transients. After 4 weeks of exposure (18.5 h/day), eight animals per group were euthanized within 1 h of magnetic field deactivation. Homogenates of liver, kidneys, spleen, and brain were prepared from each animal, quick-frozen, and shipped for analysis by four independent laboratories. No consistent pattern of differences in the ODC activity among experimental groups was found either within a laboratory or among laboratories. The results do not support the hypothesis that exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields stimulates ODC activity.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of an absence of diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery on the relationship between the Doppler flow velocities of the venae cavae. Methods Fifteen normal fetuses (normal group) were matched for gestational age with 11 fetuses with absent diastolic flow in the umbilical artery (abnormal group). In the venae cavae, the following Doppler variables were measured and compared between groups: (a) during ventricular systole: maximum (S-max) and minimum velocities (S-min) and velocity integrals (SI); (b) during ventricular diastole: peak velocity of the E-wave and its integral (EI), the A-wave and its integral (AI). A venous velocity index (VVI) was defined as (S-max + S-min)/S-max. Results In the normal group, S,,v, and VVI were significantly higher in the inferior vena cava (IVC) than in the superior vena cava (SVC). The ratio SVC-VVI/IVC-VVI was therefore always less than one. In the abnormal group, S-min, SI, E, El and VVI were higher in the SVC compared to those of the IVC. The ratio SVC-VVI/IVC-VVI was always greater than one. Conclusion In the absence of umbilical artery diastolic flow, a reciprocal shift is observed between the IVC and SVC velocity waveforms characterized by a flow profile in the IVC which resembles that of a normal SVC profile and vice versa. These changes are another manifestation of blood flow redistribution towards the brain in the presence of placental circulatory insufficiency. They should be taken into account on Doppler assessment of ventricular diastolic function based on venous flow patterns during placental circulatory impairment. Copyright (C) 2002 ISUOG.

The task requires the linking of orientation across space to detect a contour in a stimulus composed of randomly oriented Gabor elements (1.5 cpd, sigma = 0.17 deg), measured using a temporal 2AFC method. A contour of ten elements was pasted into a 10 X 10 cells array, and background elements were randomly positioned within the available cells. The effect of element spacing was investigated by varying the mean interelement distance between two and six times the period of the Gabor elements (lambda = 0.66 deg) while the total number of elements was fixed. Contour detection was measured as a function of its curvature for jagged contours and for closed contours. At all curvatures, we found that performance for chromatic mechanisms declines more steeply with the increase in element separation than does performance for the achromatic mechanism. Averaged critical element separations were 4.6 +/- 0.7, 3.6 +/- 0.4, and 2.9 +/- 0.2 deg for Ach, BY, and RG mechanisms, respectively. These results suggest that contour integration by the chromatic mechanisms relies more on short-range interactions in comparison to the achromatic mechanism. In a further experiment, we looked at the combined effect of element size and element separation in contour integration for the Ach mechanism. We found that the critical separation decreases linearly with the spatial frequency, from about 5 deg at low spatial frequency (larger elements) to about 1 deg at high spatial frequency (smaller elements) suggesting a scale invariance in contour integration. In both experiments we also found no differences between closed and open jagged contours detection in terms of element separation. The neuroanatomical implications of these findings relatively to area V 1 are discussed.

An important unresolved issue is whether different types of second-order stimuli are detected by a single, all purpose, mechanism, or by mechanisms that are specific to stimulus type. Using a conventional psychophysical paradigm, we show that for a class of second-order stimuli-textures sinusoidally modulated in orientation (OM), spatial frequency (FM), and contrast (CM)-the human visual system employs mechanisms that are selective to stimulus type. Whereas the addition of a subthreshold mask to a test pattern of the same stimulus type was found to facilitate the detection of the test, no facilitation was observed when mask and test were of different types, suggesting mechanism independence for the different types of stimulus. This finding raises the important question of whether mechanism independence is compatible with the well-known filter-rectify-filter (FRF) model of second-order stimulus detection, since FRF mechanisms, in principle, do not discriminate between stimulus types. We show that for all mask/test combinations except those with CM masks, the FRF mechanism giving the largest response to the test modulation is largely unaffected by subthreshold levels of a different stimulus-type mask. For this reason, we cannot rule out the possibility that FRF mechanisms mediate the detection of our stimuli. For combinations involving CM masks, however, we propose that a process of contrast normalization renders the test stimulus insensitive to the mask stimulus.

We have previously developed a double-labelling technique that allows visualization of activated neurons after two different stimulation sequences. The technique exploits the differential time course of mRNA versus protein expression of transcription factors. However, the precise details of the differential time course remained unknown. Here, we provide a complete up- and downregulation profile for both the c-fos and zif268 genes, as determined through combined in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical detection of the mRNA and protein products in primary visual cortex. The data presented here can be used in the design of future studies employing double-label mapping of neural activation following a compound stimulus. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, we demonstrate that the environmental toxin arsenite causes a significant increase in the phosphorylation of several amino acid residues (Thr-181, Ser-202, Thr-205, Thr-231, Ser-262, Ser-356, Ser-396, and Ser-404) in tau, which are also hyperphosphorylated under pathological conditions. Complementary phosphopeptide mapping revealed a dramatic increase in the P-32-labeling of many peptides in tau following arsenite treatment. Although arsenite activates extracelhilar-signal regulated kinases-1/-2 and stress-activated protein kinases, these enzymes did not contribute to the arsenite-increased phosphorylation, nor did they appear to normally modify tau in vivo. Tau phosphorylation induced by arsenite did not involve glycogen synthase kinase-3 or protein phosphatase-1 or -2, but the activity responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation could be inhibited with the protein kinase inhibitor roscovitine. The effects of arsenite on the phosphorylation of some tau mutations (DeltaK280, V337M, and R406W) associated with frontal-temporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 was analyzed. The unchallenged and arsenite-induced phosphorylation of some mutant proteins, especially R406W, was altered at several phosphorylation sites, indicating that these mutations can significantly affect the structure of tau in vivo. Although the major kinase(s) involved in aberrant tau phosphorylation remains elusive, these results indicate that environmental factors, such as arsenite, may be involved in the cascade leading to deregulation of tau function associated with neurodegeneration.

Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) regulates hepatic vasculature; however, the patterns of expression and activity of NOS proteins in healthy and diseased human livers are unknown. Sections of diseased (n = 42) and control livers (n = 14) were collected during orthotopic liver transplants and partial hepatectomy. The diseased sections included alcoholic cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, cholestasis, acute necrosis, and uncommon pathologies including alpha(1)-anti-trypsin disorder. The endothelial NOS (eNOS), inducible NOS (NOS), and neuronal NOS (nNOS) were studied by using the citrulline assay, Western immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. The systemic generation of plasma NO metabolites was measured by HPLC. In control livers, Ca2+-dependent and -independent NOS activities were identified by Western analysis as eNOS and NOS, respectively. The eNOS was uniformly distributed in the hepatocytes and also detected in the endlothelium of hepatic arteries, terminal hepatic venules, sinusoids, and in biliary epithelium. The !NOS was detected in hepatocytes and localized mainly in the periportal zone of the liver acinus. This pattern of distribution of eNOS and NOS in normal liver was confirmed by in situ hybridization. In diseased livers, there was a significant increase in Ca2+-independent NOS with the corresponding strong appearance of NOS in the cirrhotic areas. The eNOS was translocated to hepatocyte nuclei. Thus, eNOS and NOS proteins are differentially expressed in healthy human liver, and this expression is significantly altered in cirrhotic liver disorders.

CEP1347, a K252a derivative, retains neuroprotective properties, but does not inhibit TrkA. CEP1347 has recently been shown to directly inhibit NLAPKKKs, including MLK3, but the effect of K252a on MAPKY.Ks remains unknown. K252a and CEP1347 not only prevent death, but also facilitate neurite outgrowth and maintenance, somal hypertrophy, and neurotransmitter synthesis. The biochemical basis for these trophic effects remains unknown. We have compared the effects of CEP1347 and K252a on MLK and JNK signaling and on neurotrophic pathways that support survival and growth. Our data show that K252a is a potent inhibitor of MLK3 activity in vivo and in vitro (IC50 similar to 5 nm). However, we also found that K252a and CEP1347 activate Akt and ERK and show that blockade of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or MEK activity ablates the effect of K252a and CEP1347 on cell survival. Activation of Akt and ERK occurs through an MLK-independent pathway that may involve c-Src. Together, these data show that the neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of K252a and CEP1347 involve activation of several neurotrophic signaling pathways.

Patients and Methods: Patients were randomized to fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 to 5, every 28 days) or CVP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 and vincristine 1.2 mg/m(2) both intravenously on day 1 and prednisone 40 mg/m(2) orally on days 1 to 5, every 21 days). The primary outcome assessed was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary outcomes included treatment-free survival (TFS), overall survival (OS), treatment-related toxicity, and quality of life (QoL) according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30 version 1.0 instrument. Results: Ninety-one patients were randomized, 47 to fludarabine and 44 to CVP. There was no difference in response rates, with 64% (complete response [CR], 9%) for fludarabine versus 52% (CR, 7%) for CVP (P=.72). With a median follow-up of 42 months, median PFS (11 months v 9.1 months; P=.03) and TFS (15 months v 1 1 months; P=.02) were superior in patients receiving fludarabine. No difference in median overall survival was detected (57 months for fludarabine v 44 months for CVP; P=.95). Three patients receiving fludarabine died of treatment-related toxicity compared with none of the patients receiving CVP. Peripheral neuropathy and alopecia were more common with CVP. Patients receiving fludarabine had higher scores for social function (P=.008); no other differences in QoL were detected. Conclusion: In recurrent low-grade lymphoma, fludarabine improves PFS, TFS, and social function scores in comparison with CVP but does not improve OS.

We investigated whether synaptic transmission is regulated in these forms of plasticity by means of changes in the size of the pool of transmitter available for immediate release [the readily releasable pool (RRP)] or in the efficacy of release from an unchanging pool. Using sensorimotor synapses formed in cell culture, we estimated the number of transmitter quanta in the RRP from the asynchronous release of neurotransmitter caused by application of a hypertonic bathing solution. Our experiments indicate that the transmitter released by action potentials and by hypertonic solution comes from the same pool. The RRP was reduced after homosynaptic depression of the EPSP by low-frequency stimulation and increased after facilitation of the EPSP by application of the endogenous facilitatory transmitter serotonin (5-HT) after homosynaptic depression. However, although the fractional changes in the RRP and in the EPSP were similar for both synaptic depression and facilitation when depression was induced by repeated hypertonic stimulation, the changes in the EPSP were significantly greater than the changes in the RRP when depression was induced by repeated electrical stimulation. These observations indicate that homosynaptic depression and restoration of depressed transmission by 5-HT are caused by changes in both the amount of transmitter available for immediate release and in processes involved in the coupling of the action potential to transmitter release.

The mutation disrupts beta1 function, but how this leads to epilepsy is not understood. In this study, we make several observations that may be relevant for understanding why this beta1 mutation results in seizures. First, using electrophysiological recordings from mammalian cell lines, coexpressing sodium channel alpha subunits and either wild-type beta1 or C121Wbeta1, we show that loss of beta1 functional modulation, caused by the C121W mutation, leads to increased sodium channel availability at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and reduced sodium channel rundown during high-frequency channel activity, compared with channels coexpressed with wildtype beta1. In contrast, neither wild-type beta1 nor C121Wbeta1 significantly affected sodium current time course or the voltage dependence of channel activation. We also show, using a Drosophila S2 cell adhesion assay, that the C121W mutation disrupts beta1-beta1 homophilic cell adhesion, suggesting that the mutation may alter the ability of beta1 to mediate protein-protein interactions critical for sodium channel localization. Finally, we demonstrate that neither functional modulation nor cell adhesion mediated by wild-type beta1 is occluded by coexpression of C121Wbeta1, arguing against the idea that the mutant beta1 acts as a dominant-negative subunit. Together, these data suggest that C121Wbeta1 causes subtle effects on channel function and subcellular distribution that bias neurons toward hyperexcitabity and epileptogenesis.

More than two-thirds of the binocular cells showed phase specificity to static phase disparities leading to either summation or facilitation interactions. This proportion of spatial disparity selectivity was higher than that shown for the same area (one-third of the units) when drifting light bars or drifting spatial frequencies were used to create disparities. The range of phase disparities encoded by binocular cells in area 19 is inversely related to the optimal spatial frequency of the dominant eye. Thus, cells in this area are tuned to coarse spatial disparities which, as supported by behavioural studies, could reflect its involvement in the analysis of stereoscopic pattern having gross disparities but devoid of motion cues. Because of the nature of its interconnections with numerous visual cortical areas, area 19 could serve as a way station where stereoscopic information could be first analysed and sent to other higher order areas for a complete representation of three-dimensional objects.

We recently identified NRAGE, a protein that directly interacts with the p75NTR cytosolic region and facilitates p75NTR-mediated cell death. For the present study, we developed an inducible recombinant NRAGE adenovirus to dissect the mechanism of NRAGE-mediated apoptosis. Induced NRAGE expression resulted in robust activation of the JNK pathway that was not inhibited by the pharmacological mixed lineage kinase (MLK) inhibitor CEP1347. NRAGE induced cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c, activation of Caspases-3, -9 and -7, and caspase-dependent cell death. Blocking JNK and c-Jun action by overexpression of the JNK-binding domain of JIP1 or dominant-negative c-Jun ablated NRAGE-mediated caspase activation and NRAGE-induced cell death. These findings identify NRAGE as a p75NTR interactor capable of inducing caspase activation and cell death through a JNK-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

It provides an opportunity to examine associations between neuroanatomy, behaviour, and genetics. High-resolution Tl-weighted MRI of the brain of 12 patients with WS and 12 normal control subjects were used to estimate the shape and volume of the corpus callosum (CC), as well as the voxel intensity values as a measure its water content. The CC of patients with WS was more convex than that of normal control subjects and overall smaller in volume, particularly in the splenium and in the caudal part of the callosal body. In addition, there were higher ratio values of voxel intensity (i.e. less water content) in the mid-section of the body and the caudal part of the body of the CC. These combined features indicate an aberrant development of the CC in patients with WS and document some of the anatomical abnormalities that may underlie some of the cognitive impairments observed in subjects with WS.

Such studies can help us understand physiological responses to environmental hypoxia, as well as the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying certain ocular diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of mild systemic hypoxia on neuroretinal function through photopic flash electroretinogram (fERG) and oscillatory potential (OP) recordings. Methods: The photopic fERGs and OPs were recorded in 18 healthy adults under conditions of mild systemic hypoxia. The retinal responses were recorded before, during, and after a 5-min period of breathing 12% oxygen (O-2) in 88% nitrogen. The heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PetCO(2)), and O-2 saturation (SaO(2)) were measured throughout testing. The systemic blood pressure (BP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) were measured to derive the ocular perfusion pressure (OPP). Results: Systemic hypoxia reduced Sao(2) and PetCO(2), increased HR but did not alter the RR or OPP. The a-wave amplitude and latency were not altered throughout testing. The b-wave amplitude decreased with hypoxia, whereas its latency was not affected. The amplitude of OP1, OP2, and OP4 remained stable throughout testing, whereas the amplitude of OP3 tended to decrease with hypoxia and was increased at the end of testing. The latency of OP1, OP3, and OP4 did not vary. The latency of OP2 was reduced at the end of testing. Conclusions: Our results show that mild systemic hypoxia alters the fERG b-wave and OPs but not the a-wave. This suggests that the outer retina in humans is more resistant to a mild systemic hypoxic stress than the inner retinal layers.

Patients and methods Patients (27, six females) who had undergone SCLU were interviewed, and their charts and imaging studies reviewed retrospectively. Their urodynamic data were analysed and bladder capacity, end-filling pressure, safe capacity and percentage of expected capacity for age compared before and after surgery. Continence was defined as dryness between catheterizations or voiding with no need for protective pads. Results The mean (SD) follow-up since the SCLU was 1.7 (1.1) years; continence was achieved in 24 of the 27 (89%) patients with no additional procedures. No significant upper tract changes developed. Bladder capacity, safe capacity for age and end-filling pressure were all improved significantly. There were two AUS erosions necessitating removal and in one patient the augmentation failed. Six patients early in the series developed an 'hourglass' deformity that required correction. Modifications to the technique to avoid this complication are discussed. Conclusions For children with neuropathic incontinence who require both augmentation of outlet resistance and bladder storage capacity, the combination of the AUS and SCLU effectively achieves continence with no upper tract deterioration. SCLU is also the preferred method of augmentation when adverse bladder changes occur after implanting the AUS.

However, animal studies showing use-dependent changes in motor cortex organization suggest that functional changes also may occur in response to disability. We therefore wished to test whether brain injury and disability lead to distinguishable patterns of activation with hand movement in patients with multiple sclerosis. By employing a passive as well as an active movement task, we also wished to test whether these changes were independent of voluntary recruitment and thus more likely to reflect true functional reorganization. Fourteen patients [Extended Disability Status Score (EDSS) 0-7.5] with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis were selected on the basis of pathology load and hand functional impairment for three study groups: group 1, low diffuse central brain injury (DCBI) as assessed from relative N-acetylaspartate concentration (a marker of axonal integrity) and normal hand function (n = 6); group 2, greater DCBI and normal hand function (n = 4); and group 3, greater DCBI and impaired hand function (n = 4). Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to map brain activation with a four-finger and both one-finger passive and active flexion-extension movement tasks for the three groups. Considering all the patients, we found increased activity in ipsilateral premotor and ipsilateral motor cortex (IMC) and in the ipsilateral inferior parietal lobule with increasing global disability (as assessed from the EDSS score). These changes appear to define true functional reorganization, as fMRI activations in IMC (r = 0.87, P < 0.001) and in the contralateral motor cortex (r = 0.67, P < 0.007) were highly correlated between active and passive single finger movements. We attempted to disambiguate any distinct effects of disability and brain injury by direct contrasts between patients differing predominantly in one or the other. To make these contrasts as powerful as possible, we used impairment of finger tapping as a measure of disability specific to the hand tested. A direct contrast of patients matched for DCBI, but differing in hand disability (group 3 - group 2) showed greater bilateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortex activation with greater disability alone. A contrast matched for hand disability, but differing in DCBI (group 2 - group 1) showed a different pattern of changes with relative ipsilateral premotor cortex and bilateral supplementary motor area activity. We conclude that the pattern of brain activity with finger movements changes both with increasing DCBI and with hand disability in patients with multiple sclerosis, and that these changes are distinct. Those related directly to disability may reflect responses to altered patterns of use. As injury- and disability-related activation changes are found even with passive finger movements, they may reflect true brain reorganization.

Mivacurium is a mixture of three isomers, two of which are rapidly broken down in vivo by plasma cholinesterases. This study investigates the stereospecificity of mivacurium in vitro degradation to determine if it accounts for its in vivo behaviour. Methods. The in vitro rate of degradation of each isomer of mivacurium and the in vitro rate of formation of their primary (monoesters and alcohols) and secondary (alcohols) metabolites were examined using human plasma from six healthy volunteers. The in vitro rate of degradation of the monoester metabolites was also assessed. All these determinations were made using a stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Results. The in vitro rate of disappearance of the two active isomers of mivacurium was very rapid, with mean values for the trans trans and cis trans isomers of 0.803 and 0.921 min(-1) respectively. These values are twofold faster than published in vivo data. The in vitro rate of disappearance was much slower for the cis cis isomer, with a mean value of 0.0106 min(-1). The cis trans isomer was converted exclusively to cis monoester and trans alcohol, while only metabolites in the trans and cis configuration were found for the trans trans and cis cis isomers respectively. Mean in vitro rates of disappearance for the trans and cis monoester were 0.00750 and 0.000633 min(-1) respectively. Conclusions. The in vitro rates of hydrolysis of the active isomers of mivacurium confirm that plasma cholinesterases play a major role in their in vivo degradation, but that in vivo elimination is slowed by extravascular distribution. Mivacurium hydrolysis is stereoselective, the ester group in the trans configuration being more accessible to enzymatic attack. This stereoselective pattern, along with the relatively slow breakdown of the cis cis isomer, sheds light on the in vivo disposition of the cis alcohol metabolite.

In dividing cells, cell cycle-associated protein kinases, which are referred to as cyclin-dependent-kinases (Cdks), regulate proliferation, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis. In contrast, all Cdks in post-mitotic neurons, with the notable exception of Cdk5, are silenced. Surprisingly, misregulation of Cdks occurs in neurons in a wide diversity of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Ectopic expression of these proteins in neurons potently induces cell death with hallmarks of apoptosis. Deregulation of the unique, cell cycle-unrelated Cdk5 by its truncated co-activator, p25 and p29, contributes to neurodegeneration by altering the phosphorylation state of non-membrane-associated proteins and possibly through the induction of cell cycle proteins. On the other hand, cycling Cdks such as Cdk2, Cdk4 and Cdk6, initiate death pathways by derepressing E2F-1/Rb-dependent transcription at the neuronal G1/S checkpoint. Thus, Cdk5 and cycling Cdks may have little in common in the healthy CNS, but they likely conspire in leading neurons to their demise.

In neurodegenerative diseases, a precise volumetric analysis of MTL structures can assist in differential diagnosis and can be used in guiding early treatment. Also, in functional neuroimaging, exact localization is crucial for the correct interpretation of focal MTL activations with respect to specific memory functions. In presently available protocols, precise and consistent volumetric analysis of MTL structures is compromised in numerous ways. Most importantly, in order to cover all structures of the MTL, the researcher is presently forced to combine independently developed segmentation protocols for different structures from different laboratories. This approach limits anatomical precision because these protocols are based on different anatomical guidelines and descriptions that cannot easily be integrated. The segmentation approach presented in this paper was designed to address this issue by presenting segmentation guidelines for all major structures of the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). It was developed directly to complement a volumetric protocol for hippocampus and amygdala (Pruessner et al., 2000, Cereb Cortex 10:433-442), thus allowing volumetric assessment of all major MTL structures in an integrated and consistent manner. Furthermore, it takes into consideration the neuroanatomical appearance of the collateral sulcus by presenting a method to correct the volumes of the surrounding cortices for the variability of this sulcus. The protocol was validated using MR images of 40 healthy normal control subjects (20 men and 20 women, age range 18-42 years). Intra-and interrater coefficients are presented, together with mean values for the volumes of all PHG structures, correlations with age and sex, and tests for hemispheric differences.

J	Price, DD; Barrell, JJ; Rainville, P				Price, DD; Barrell, JJ; Rainville, P			Integrating experiential-phenomenological methods and neuroscience to study neural mechanisms of pain and consciousness	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Article						experiential paradigm; phenomenology; pain qualities; neuroscience	CENTRAL SUMMATION; 2ND PAIN; DIMENSION	Understanding the nature of pain at least partly depends on recognizing its inherent first person epistemology and on using a first person experiential and third person experimental approach to study it. This approach may help to understand some of the neural mechanisms of pain and consciousness by integrating experiential-phenomenological methods with those of neuroscience. Examples that approximate this strategy include studies of second pain summation and its relationship to neural activities and brain imaging-psychophysical studies wherein sensory and affective qualities of pain are correlated with cerebral cortical activity. The experiential paradigm of Price and Barrell (1980) offers the possibility of improved designs and methods for investigating neural mechanisms underlying pain and consciousness.

Methods: Field potential and [K+](o) recordings were obtained from mouse combined hippocampus-entorhinal cortex slices maintained in vitro. Results: 4AP induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent ictal discharges that originated in the entorhinal cortex, disappeared over time, but were reestablished by cutting the Schaffer collateral (n = 20) or by depressing CA3 network excitability with local application of glutamatergic receptor antagonists (n = 5). In addition, two types of interictal activity occurred throughout the experiment. The first type was CA3 driven and was abolished by a non-NMDA glutamatergic receptor antagonist. The second type was largely contributed by gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor-mediated conductances and persisted during blockade of glutamatergic transmission. The absence of CA3-driven interictal discharges in the entorhinal cortex after Schaffer collateral cut facilitated the GABA-mediated interictal potentials that corresponded to large [K+](o) elevations and played a role in ictal discharge initiation. Accordingly, ictal discharges along with GABA-mediated interictal potentials disappeared during GABA(A)-receptor blockade (n = 7) or activation of p-opioid receptors that inhibit GABA release (n = 4). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CA3-driven interictal events restrain ictal discharge generation in the entorhinal cortex by modulating the size of interictal GABA-mediated potentials that lead to large [K+](o) elevations capable of initiating ictal discharges in this structure.

To increase neuronal excitability, and thus to elicit spontaneous field potential activity in vitro , we applied medium containing: (i) zero [Mg2+]; (ii) high [K+] (8.25 mm); or (iii) low concentrations of the K+ channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 0.5-1 mum). Of these procedures, only the last was effective in triggering oscillatory activity that depended on the type of tissue. Thus, during 4AP application: (i) sequences of fast (intraburst frequency 9.5-16.1 Hz) and slower (5-8.9 Hz) field potential oscillations (FPOs) were recorded in WAG/Rij slices (n = 23), but (ii) only fast FPOs were seen in NEC slices (n = 7). Slower FPOs in WAG/Rij slices reflected a larger degree of thalamocortical synchronization than fast FPOs, and disappeared after surgical separation of cortex and thalamus (n = 5); under these conditions fast FPOs continued to occur in thalamus only. In addition, fast and slower FPOs disappeared in all areas of the WAG/Rij slice during thalamic application of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (n = 3), while fast FPOs continued to occur in thalamus when kynurenic acid was applied to the cortex (n = 4). Bath application of the N -methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist 3,3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP) abolished slower FPOs in WAG/Rij cortex and thalamus (n = 6) without infuencing fast FPOs recorded in WAG/Rij (n = 6) or NEC slices (n = 4). Moreover, cortical application of CPP (n = 6) abated slower FPOs although they persisted following CPP application to the thalamus (n = 7). Our data demonstrate that highly synchronized, slower FPOs can occur during 4AP application in WAG/Rij but not in NEC slices. This activity, which may represent an in vitro hallmark of thalamocortical epileptogenicity, requires the function of reciprocally connected thalamic and cortical networks and depends on cortical NMDA receptor-mediated mechanisms.

By comparison to the C57BL/6 background strain controlled for age and gender, Tg13592 transgenic mice had fewer movements in an automated chamber and fewer enclosed arm entries in the elevated plus-maze. This hypoactivity was probably due to a loss in the motivation to explore novel environmental stimuli rather than motor weakness or anxiety. In addition, the acquisition of place learning in the Morris water maze task was impaired in Tg13592 mice. The transgenic mice were not impaired in a probe trial or while swimming toward a visible platform. These results are concordant with the hypothesis that transgene expression of the C-terminal sequence of human betaAPP in brain is sufficient for causing behavioral abnormalities. The hypoactivity and the spatial learning deficit were associated with higher cytochrome oxidase activity seen in thalamic nuclei, indicating that altered regional brain metabolism caused by betaAPP transgene expression may be responsible for the behavioral changes.

For instance, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can prevent the death of dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons in rats. Most neurotrophic factor receptors, such as TrkB for BDNF, are tyrosine kinases whose signaling is terminated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). We tested the idea that inhibition of PTPs, and thus potentially enhancement of the efficiency of endogenous trophic factors and their receptors, would lead to increased neuronal survival. After a 2-week infusion of the small PTP inhibitor molecule peroxovanadium. (pVa, pervanadate) close to the substantia nigra of adult rats, up to 66% of axotomized substantia nigra neurons had survived, compared to only 33% in control rats infused with PBS. PVa most likely affected TrkB and/or downstream signaling molecules, as ineffective doses of BDNF and pVa had a synergistic effect when given simultaneously, rescuing 82% of the neurons. PVa stimulated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the noninjured substantia nigra but did not prevent axotomy-induced loss of TH. These results raise the possibility that PTP inhibition can prevent neuronal death by enhancing neurotrophic factor signaling pathways in the adult mammalian nervous system, identifies an important role for PTPs in neuronal functioning, and points to a novel small molecule treatment approach for neurologic disorders (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

In the following years most children learn alternatives to physical aggression. Approximately 4% of children have high levels of physical aggression from early childhood to late adolescence. These children can be considered to show chronic physical aggression. They are at high risk of causing injuries to others and to themselves. They are also at high risk of many other co-morbid mental health conditions, school failure, substance abuse, depression, unemployment, spouse abuse, child abuse, and suicide. There is some evidence that, because of their risky style of behavior, they are also at high risk of many other medical conditions such as cardiovascular problems, cancer, and brain damage. Socialization of aggressive behavior during the preschool years should help prevent injuries throughout the life span.

The approach is based on a general compartmental description of the tracer's fate in vivo and determines a parsimonious model consistent with the measured data. The technique involves the determination of a sparse selection of kinetic basis functions from an overcomplete dictionary using the method of basis pursuit denoising. This enables the characterization of the systems impulse response function from which values of the systems macro parameters can be estimated. These parameter estimates can be obtained from a region of interest analysis or as parametric images from a voxel-based analysis. In addition, model order estimates are returned that correspond to the number of compartments in the estimated compartmental model. Validation studies evaluate the methods performance against two preexisting data led techniques, namely, graphical analysis and spectral analysis. Application of this technique to measured PET data is demonstrated using [C-11]diprenorphine (opiate receptor) and [C-11]WAY-100635 (5-HTIA receptor). Although the method is presented in the context of PET neuroreceptor binding studies, it has general applicability to the quantification of PET/SPECT radiotracer studies in neurology, oncology, and cardiology.

Children with agenesis of the corpus callosum were identified in a comprehensive computerized database of all patients seen in a single pediatric neurology practice over an 11-year interval. Medical records were then systematically reviewed. Twenty-four children with agenesis of the corpus callosum were identified of a total of 6911 children in the database (0.35%). Fifteen were male (62.5%); 9 (37.5%) had presented antenatally, 6 (25%) neonatally, and 9 (37.5%) postneonatally. Eight (33.3%) were microcephalic, 12 (50%) were dysmorphic, 11 (45.8%) had coexisting epilepsy, and 9 (37.5%) had a cerebral palsy variant. Investigations revealed an etiology in 11 (45.8%): 3 chromosomal abnormality, 3 metabolic disorder, 3 cerebral dysgenesis, and 2 genetic syndromes (Aicardi, Andermann). Outcomes identified included normal or mild developmental delay in 7 (29.2%) and moderate-severe developmental delay in the remaining 17 (70.8%). Factors predictive of successful etiologic determination on bivariate analysis included moderate-severe developmental delay or associated cerebral dysgenesis. Factors predictive of eventual developmental outcome included microcephaly, coexisting epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or cerebral dysgenesis. A spectrum of clinical presentations, underlying etiology, and developmental outcome is thus apparent in children with agenesis of the corpus callosum. An underlying etiology can be identified in slightly less than half of cases, and a normal or mildly delayed outcome is apparent in slightly less than a third. Factors predictive of identifying an underlying etiology or eventual outcome can be identified.

A consecutive series of children with benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes was identified in a single pediatric neurology practice. Medical charts were then systematically retrospectively reviewed. A total of 66 children with benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes was identified; 52 (78.8%) required either no medication (n = 7) or a single medication (n = 45) for seizure control, whereas 14 (21.2%) required two medications. The two groups did not differ with respect to gender, age of onset, type (generalized or partial) of initial seizure, or whether EEG abnormalities were unilateral or bilateral. They did differ significantly with respect to the mean number of seizures experienced prior to initiating treatment (group 1, 2.06, versus group 2, 4.36; t = 3.40, P = .005). In those treated (n = 59), the initial medication selected (carbamazepine versus noncarbamazepine) in the two groups was significantly different: group 1, 40 (carbamazepine)/45, versus group 2, 9 (carbamazepine)/14; chi(2) = 4.59; P = .03. The difference in frequency between the two groups of associated comorbid conditions (tics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], learning disability) almost reached the threshold of statistical significance: group 1, 7/52, versus group 2, 5/14 (chi(2) = 3.67, P = .06). A subset of children with benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes may require more than one medication for effective seizure control. This subset experiences more seizures prior to the initiation of treatment, is more likely to be treated initially with a noncarbamazepine medication, and tends to have a higher frequency of associated conditions.

The channel activity underlying I-NaP consisted of prolonged and frequently delayed bursts during which repetitive openings were separated by short closings. The mean duration of openings within bursts was strongly voltage dependent, and increased by e times per every similar to12 mV of depolarization. On the other hand, intraburst closed times showed no major voltage dependence. The mean duration of burst events was also relatively voltage insensitive. The analysis of burst-duration frequency distribution returned two major, relatively voltage-independent time constants of similar to28 and similar to190 ms. The probability of burst openings to occur also appeared largely voltage independent. Because of the above "persistent" Na+-channel properties, the voltage dependence of the conductance underlying whole-cell I-NaP turned out to be largely the consequence of the pronounced voltage dependence of intraburst open times. On the other hand, some kinetic properties of the macroscopic I-NaP and in particular the fast and intermediate I-NaP-decay components observed during step depolarizations, were found to largely reflect mean burst duration of the underlying channel openings. A further I-NaP decay process, namely slow inactivation, was paralleled instead by a progressive increase of interburst closed times during the application of long-lasting (i.e., 20 s) depolarizing pulses. In addition, long-lasting depolarizations also promoted a channel gating modality characterized by shorter burst durations than normally seen using 500-ms test pulses, with a predominant burst-duration time constant of similar to5-6 ms. The above data, therefore, provide a detailed picture of the single-channel bases of I-NaP voltage-dependent and kinetic properties in entorhinal cortex layer II neurons.

Isolated nuclei from porcine cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (PCECs) produced PAF-molecular species in response to H2O2. Using FACS analysis, we demonstrated the expression of PAF receptors on cell and nuclear surfaces of PCECs. Confocal microscopy studies performed on PCECs, Chinese hamster ovary cells stably overexpressing PAF receptors, and isolated nuclei from PCECs also showed a robust nuclear distribution of PAF receptors. Presence of PAF receptors at the cell nucleus was further revealed in brain endothelial cells by radioligand binding experiments, immunoblotting, and in situ in brain by immunoelectron microscopy. Stimulation of nuclei with methylcarbamate-PAF evoked a decrease in cAMP production and a pertussis toxin-sensitive rise in nuclear calcium, unlike observations in plasma membrane, which exhibited a pertussis toxin-insensitive elevation in inositol phosphates. Moreover, on isolated nuclei methylcarbamate-PAF evoked the expression of proinflammatory genes inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and was associated with augmented extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB binding to the DNA consensus sequence. COX-2 expression was prevented by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and NF-kappaB inhibitors. This study describes for the first time the nucleus as a putative organelle capable of generating PAF and expresses its receptor, which upon stimulation induces the expression of the proinflammatory gene COX-2.

In this context, the drug CP-661,631 has been developed to inhibit the TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE). However, TACE is also implicated in amyloid precursor protein secretion. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes constitutive and regulated secretion by alpha-secretase endoproteolytic cleavage within the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) domain. Alternative cleavage at the N- and C-terminus of the Abeta domain by beta- and gamma-secretases results in the production of Abeta. In many cellular and in vivo animal models, increased secretion of APP results in a concomitant decrease in the production of Abeta suggesting that the two pathways are intricately linked. However, in human primary neuron cultures, increased APP secretion is not associated with a decrease in total Abeta production. To determine if the use of CP-661,631 may enhance amyloidogenic processing in human brain, we have assessed the effect of CP-661,631 on APP metabolism in primary cultures of human neurons. Our results show that CP-661,631 effectively prevents regulated APP secretion but does not increase total Abeta levels in human primary neuron cultures.

NMDA in short-term spinal cats	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; AMINO-ACID RECEPTORS; ELICITS FICTIVE LOCOMOTION; MOTOR PATTERNS; CORD INVITRO; QUISQUALATE RECEPTORS; PLATEAU POTENTIALS; ALPHA-MOTONEURONES; NEONATAL RAT; DORSAL HORN	Excitatory amino acids (EAA) have been reported to induce fictive locomotion in different in vitro and in vivo preparations in a variety of species through their actions on both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and non-NMDA receptors. NMDA-induced intrinsic membrane properties such as intrinsic motoneuronal membrane oscillations and plateau potentials have been suggested to play a role in the generation of locomotion. There is, however, no information on the ability of NMDA in triggering spinal locomotion in awake behaving animals. Because most of the previous work on the induction of locomotion has concentrated on monoaminergic drugs, mainly noradrenergic drugs, the aim of this study is to examine the potential of NMDA in initiating locomotion in chronic spinal cats within the first week after spinalization. Five cats chronically implanted with an intrathecal cannula and electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were used. EMG activity synchronized to video images of the hindlimbs were recorded. The results show that during the early posuransection period (within the 1st week postspinalization), NMDA did not trigger robust locomotion as did noradrenergic drugs. The predominant effects of NMDA were a general hyperexcitability reflected by fast tremor, toe fanning, and an increase in small alternating hindlimb movements with no foot placement nor weight support. During the intermediate phase posttransection (6-8 days), when the cats were able to make some rudimentary steps with foot placement, NMDA significantly enhanced the locomotor performance, which lasted for 24-72 h postinjection. NMDA was also found to increase the excitability of the cutaneous reflex transmission only in early spinal cats. One possible hypothesis for the ineffectiveness of NMDA in triggering locomotion in early spinal cats could be attributed to the widespread activation of NMDA receptors on various neuronal elements involved in the transmission of afferent pathways that in turn may interfere with the expression of locomotion. The marked effects of NMDA in intermediate-spinal cats suggest that NMDA receptors play an important role in locomotion perhaps through its role on intrinsic membrane properties of neurons in shaping and amplifying spinal neuronal transmission or by augmenting the sensory afferent inputs. The long-term effects mediated by NMDA receptors have been reported in the literature and may involve mechanisms such as induction of long-term potentiation or interactions with neuropeptides. The effects of NMDA injection in intact cats and long-term chronic spinal cats will be addressed in a forthcoming companion paper.

J	Meftah, EM; Shenasa, J; Chapman, CE				Meftah, EM; Shenasa, J; Chapman, CE			Effects of a cross-modal manipulation of attention on somatosensory cortical neuronal responses to tactile stimuli in the monkey	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PASSIVE TEXTURE-DISCRIMINATION; MACAQUE VISUAL-CORTEX; THALAMIC VPM NUCLEUS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; DISCHARGE PROPERTIES; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VIBROTACTILE STIMULI; PARIETAL CORTEX; BEHAVING MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEYS	The role of attention in modulating tactile sensitivity in primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) was addressed using a cross-modal manipulation of attention, somatosensory versus visual. Two adult monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to perforin two tasks: tactile discrimination of a change in the texture of a surface presented to digits 3 and 4 and visual discrimination of a change in the intensity of a light. In each trial, standard texture (2 mm spatial period, SP) and visual stimuli were presented. These were followed by an increase in SP and/or luminance. Each trial was preceded by an instruction cue (colored light) that directed the animal to attend and respond to the change in one modality while ignoring any change in the other modality. The two tasks were interleaved during the recording, on a trial-by-trial basis. Extracellular recordings were made from 178 neurons (SI, 102; SII, 76), all with a cutaneous receptive field on the stimulated digit tips. Discharge was quantified in both tasks during the instruction, the standard-stimuli, and the texture-change periods. The results showed that selective attention to tactile stimuli had qualitatively and quantitatively greater and earlier effects in SII than SI. Twenty-four of 102 SI cells showed a significant change in discharge with the direction of attention. For almost all cells (20/24), discharge was enhanced when attention was directed toward the tactile stimuli; the effects were most frequent in the analysis interval that encompassed the change in SP (16/24). A significantly higher proportion of SII cells were attention-sensitive (47/76). The effects were concentrated in the texture-change period (39/47) but also included earlier periods in the trial (instruction period, n = 15; standard-stimuli period, n = 32). Attention-related modulation that spanned all three intervals (n = 11) likely reflected baseline changes in discharge. For the texture-sensitive cells (43 in SI, 37 in SII), the mean change in discharge frequency (post texture change - pre-texture change) in each task was significantly increased in SII but not SI with selective attention. The results are consistent with a two-stage modulation of parietal cortical discharge, an initial stage (SI) in which there is some enhancement of sensory responses to the salient feature, the texture change, and a second stage (SII) in which baseline changes occur, along with further feature selection. These controls may be independently exerted on SI and SII, or they may reflect top-down controls from SII to SI.

Recordings were obtained in slices from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P27 rats using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. EPSCs were evoked by local electrical stimulation, and all experiments were conducted in the presence of bicuculline methchloride in the bathing medium and with QX-314 in the recording pipette. Under these conditions, postsynaptic currents consisted of glutamatergic EPSCs typically consisting of two components mediated by AMPA/kainate (KA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The addition of acetylcholine (ACh) or carbachol (CCh) to the superfusing medium resulted in a decrease of 30-60% of both AMPA/KA- and NMDA-mediated EPSCs. In contrast, ACh produced an increase (approximate to35%) in both AMPA/KA and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs when administered in the presence of the muscarinic antagonist atropine. These excitatory effects were mimicked by the nicotinic receptor agonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium iodide (DMPP) and blocked by the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, showing the presence of a cholinergic modulation mediated by nicotinic receptors in the nAcb. The antagonistic effects of atropine were mimicked by pirenzepine, suggesting that the muscarinic depression of the EPSCs was mediated by M-1/M-4 receptors. In addition, the inhibitory effects of ACh on NMDA but not on AMPA/KA receptor-mediated EPSC significantly increased during the first two postnatal weeks. We found that, under our experimental conditions, cholinergic agonists produced no changes on membrane holding currents, on the decay time of the AMPA/KA EPSC, or on responses evoked by exogenous application of glutamate in the presence of tetrodotoxin, but they produced significant changes in paired pulse ratio, suggesting that their action was mediated by presynaptic mechanisms. In contrast, CCh produced consistent changes in the membrane-and firing properties of medium spiny (MS) neurons when QX-314 was omitted from the recording pipette solution, suggesting that this substance actually blocked postsynaptic cholinergic modulation. Together, these results suggest that ACh can decrease or increase glutamatergic neurotransmission in the nAcb by, respectively, acting on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors located on excitatory terminals. The cholinergic modulation of AMPA/KA and NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the nAcb during postnatal development could play an important role in activity-dependent developmental processes in refining the excitatory drive on MS neurons by gating specific inputs.

These movements function to rapidly transfer the visual axes between targets located at different eccentricities and depths. Our primary objective was to determine whether the signals carried by ABNs during these movements are appropriate to drive the motion of the eye to which they project. We also asked whether ABNs encode eye movements similarly during disjunctive saccades and disjunctive fixation. To address the first objective we 1) assessed whether we could predict the discharge dynamics of individual neurons during disjunctive saccades based on their discharge properties during conjugate saccades and 2) directly estimated the sensitivity of individual neurons to either the ipsilateral/contralateral eye or the conjugate/vergence position and velocity using bootstrap statistics. Our main finding was that during disjunctive saccades in the direction ipsilateral to the recording site (ON-direction), the majority of ABNs preferentially encoded the velocity and the position of the ipsilateral eye. The remaining neurons predominantly encoded the conjugate motion of the eyes (i.e., were equally sensitive to the motion of both eyes). Generally, ipsilateral/contralateral eye based models better described neuronal discharges than conjugate/vergence based models, yet both model structures yielded similar conclusions. Moreover, the preferred eye of individual neurons based on their position and velocity sensitivities were generally well matched. We also found that for saccades in the OFF-direction, the pausing behavior of ABNs was similar during conjugate and disjunctive saccades, with the exception that for movements of small amplitudes, more ABNs paused during conjugate saccades. Finally, we found that putative motoneurons and internuclear neurons encoded ON- and OFF-direction disjunctive saccades in a similar manner. To address our second objective, we compared the discharge properties of individual ABNs during disjunctive saccades and disjunctive fixation. Good coherence was observed between the preferred eye of individual ABNs during the two behaviors. Taken together, our results indicate that although individual ABNs can encode the motion of both eyes to various degrees, the population drive of ABNs accounts for most of the movement of the ipsilateral eye during disjunctive saccades and disjunctive fixation.

Prerequisites for local translation are the targeted transport of RNAs to distal sites of synthesis in dendrites and translational control mechanisms to limit synthesis to times of demand. Here we identify dendritic BC1 RNA as a specific repressor of translation. Experimental use of internal ribosome entry mechanisms and sucrose density gradient centrifugation showed that BC1-mediated repression targets translation at the level of initiation. Specifically, BC1 RNA inhibited formation of the 48S preinitiation complex, i.e., recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit to the messenger RNA (mRNA). However, 48S complex formation that is independent of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4 (eIF4) family of initiation factors was found to be refractory to inhibition by BC1 RNA, a result that implicates at least one of these factors in the BC1 repression pathway. Biochemical experiments indicated a specific interaction of BC1 RNA with eIF4A, an RNA unwinding factor, and with poly( A)-binding protein. Both proteins were found enriched in synaptodendritic microdomains. Significantly, BC1-mediated repression was shown to be effective not only in cap-dependent translation initiation but also in eIF4-dependent internal initiation. The results suggest a functional role of BC1 RNA as a mediator of translational control in local protein synthesis in nerve cells.

J	Frouin, V; Comtat, C; Reilhac, A; Gregoire, MC				Frouin, V; Comtat, C; Reilhac, A; Gregoire, MC			Correction of partial-volume effect for PET striatal imaging: Fast implementation and study of robustness	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						partial-volume effects; 3-dimensional PET; simulation; segmentation; registration	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN; REGISTRATION; MRI; IMAGES; REGION	PET imaging of D-2 receptors or F-18-L-dopa metabolism are reference protocols to follow and study neurodegenerative diseases, but the accuracy of striatal PET imaging is limited by the partial-volume effect (PVE). For such studies, the geometric transfer matrix (GTM) method has been proposed to correct the regional mean values for PVE and is now widely used. Methods: The GTM method models the geometric interactions induced by the PET system between the anatomic regions in which PVE correction is performed. This implies estimation of the corresponding regional spread function (RSF). The literature describes 2 implementations for the RSF calculation; they differ in the way the point spread function (PSF) of the imaging system is modeled, but no comparison or discussion has been given. The first and reference implementation uses an accurate intrinsic detector PSF that is applied in the sinogram space. The second uses a global PSF that is applied in the image space. In this work, we compared the 2 GTM implementations for 3-dimensional (3D) PET striatal imaging using Monte Carlo simulations and a phantom study. We studied the robustness of the GTM correction with respect to residual registration errors between PET and anatomy and with respect to residual segmentation errors. Results: Despite the differences in RSF calculation and computation cost between the 2 implementations, similar recovery results were obtained (between 95% and 100%). The study of robustness of the GTM correction yielded 2 results. A realistic residual misregistration between the anatomic and PET images did not modify the algorithm accuracy but decreased its precision. Conversely, a realistic residual missegmentation of the anatomic regions submitted to GTM correction decreased the correction accuracy. Conclusion: A simple but efficient implementation in the image space of the GTM method yields accurate PVE correction in striatal regions in studies with 3D PET and enables clinical use.

J	Ghamari-Langroudi, M; Bourque, CW				Ghamari-Langroudi, M; Bourque, CW			Flufenamic acid blocks depolarizing afterpotentials and phasic firing in rat supraoptic neurones	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							IN-VITRO; NUCLEUS NEURONS; AFTER-POTENTIALS; MAGNOCELLULAR NEURONS; CATION CHANNELS; IONIC BASIS; VASOPRESSIN; MECHANISMS; OXYTOCIN; CELLS	Depolarizing afterpotentials (DAPs) that follow action potentials in magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) are thought to underlie the generation of phasic firing, a pattern that optimizes vasopressin release from the neurohypophysis. Previous work has suggested that the DAP may result from the Ca2+-dependent reduction of a resting K+ conductance. Here we examined the effects of flufenamic acid (FFA), a blocker of Ca2+-dependent non-selective cation (CAN) channels, on DAPs and phasic firing using intracellular recordings from supraoptic MNCs in superfused explants of rat hypothalamus. Application of FFA, but not solvent (0.1 % DMSO), reversibly inhibited (IC50 = 13.8 muM; R = 0.97) DAPs and phasic firing with a similar time course, but had no significant effects (P > 0.05) on membrane potential, spike threshold and input resistance, nor on the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous synaptic potentials. Moreover, FFA did not affect (P > 0.05) the amplitude, duration, undershoot, or frequency-dependent broadening of action potentials elicited during the spike trains used to evoke DAPs. These findings suggest that FFA inhibits the DAP by directly blocking the channels responsible for its production, rather than by interfering with Ca2+ influx. They also support a role for DAPs in the generation of phasic firing in MNCs. Finally, the absence of a depolarization and increased membrane resistance upon application of FFA suggests that the DAP in MNCs may not be due to the inhibition of resting K+ current, but to the activation of CAN channels.

From in vitro experiments, entactin-1 was assigned a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the basement membrane because of its binding affinity to other components, such as type IV collagen and laminin. Entactin-1 also interacts with integrin receptors on the cell surface to mediate cell adhesion, spreading, and motility. Targeted disruption of the entactin-1 gene in the mouse presented in this study revealed a duplication of the entacin-1 locus. Homozygous mutants for the functional locus lacked entactin-1 mRNA and protein and often displayed seizure-like symptoms and loss of muscle control in the hind legs. The behavior patterns suggested the presence of neurologic deficits in the central nervous system, thus providing genetic evidence linking entactin-1 to proper functions of the neuromuscular system. In homozygous mutants, structural alterations in the basement membranes were found only in selected locations including brain capillaries and the lens capsule. The morphology of the basement membranes in other tissues examined superficially appeared to be normal. These observations suggest that the lost functions of entactin-1 result in pathologic changes that are highly tissue specific.

We have shown previously that mammalian GATA-6 genes have the potential to encode two protein isoforms, resulting from alternative, in-frame, initiator methionine codons. We have generated GATA-6 antibodies, including one specific to the longer form of GATA-6, and by immunohistochemical analysis we demonstrate here that the longer protein, which is the more potent transcriptional transactivator, is widely expressed in vivo. In accordance with previous RNA expression studies, GATA-6 protein was found to be abundant within regions of the gut and pulmonary systems, in addition to the heart myocardium. We also report novel GATA-6 expression within sites of chondrogenesis derived from cranial neural crest and sclerotomes. Surprisingly however, levels of GATA-6 protein were substantially reduced within the endocardial cushions and outflow tract of the heart. These are regions which express the highest levels of GATA-6 RNA within the heart. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Thompson, C; Belanger, M				Thompson, C; Belanger, M			Effects of vibration in inline skating on the Hoffmann reflex, force, and proprioception	MEDICINE AND SCIENCE IN SPORTS AND EXERCISE			English	Article						EMG; stimulation; Hoffmann reflex; torque; statesthesia	MAXIMAL VOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONS; TENDON VIBRATION; MUSCLE VIBRATION; INHIBITION; RESPONSES; AFFERENTS; FATIGUE	Purpose: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of vibrations induced by inline skating on the Hoffmann (H) reflex, maximal voluntary isometric (MVC) force, and ankle proprioception. Methods: Accelerometers were used to measure the frequencies and amplitudes of the vibrations encountered at the skate and mid-tibia levels. The soleus H reflex was recorded before and after (for 30 min) inline skating for 30 min. Maximal plantarflexor contractions were performed against a strain gauge while EMG was recorded from the soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles. An ankle position-matching test was carried out to measure proprioception at the ankle. A Modified Borg Scale was used to obtain the appreciation of leg numbness and fatigue during inline skating. Results: The vibrations measured at the skate chassis level had a mean frequency of 141.8 +/- 25.2 Hz and an amplitude of less than or equal to 5 g. These vibrations were transmitted to the lower limb as measured by a mean frequency of 34.4 +/- 27.7 Hz and an amplitude of less than or equal to 2 g at the mid-tibia level. The results demonstrate a clear inhibition (similar to35%) of the H reflex after skating that persisted for >35 min after skating. A 10% drop in MVC plantarflexor force was observed after inline skating. There was no accompanying change in EMG signal parameters. The ankle proprioception of the subjects decreased after skating, resulting in reproduction errors twice as large as before skating. Conclusion: Vibrations encountered during inline skating resulted in modifications of neuromotor functions related to the muscle spindles' primary afferent. These changes may partially be explained by presynaptic inhibition; however, a more plausible mechanism may be a decrease in the la afferent transmission induced by the vibration.

Damage to astrocytes characterized by cell swelling (acute liver failure) or Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis (chronic liver failure) can be readily reproduced by acute or chronic exposure of these cells in vitro to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of ammonia. Furthermore, exposure of the brain or cultured astrocytes to ammonia results in similar alterations in expression of genes coding for key astrocytic proteins. Such proteins include the structural glial fibrillary acidic protein, glutamate transporters, and peripheral-type (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors. Brain-blood ammonia concentration ratios (normally of the order of 2) are increased up to fourfold in liver failure and arterial blood ammonia concentrations are good predictors of cerebral herniation in patients with acute liver failure. Studies using 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with chronic liver failure reveal a positive correlation between the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and brain concentrations of the brain ammonia-detoxification product glutamine. Increased intracellular glutamine may be a contributory cause of brain edema in hyperammonemia. Positron emission tomography studies using (HN3)-H-13 provide evidence of increased blood-brain ammonia transfer and brain ammonia utilization rates in patients with chronic liver failure. In addition to the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides and antibiotics to reduce gut ammonia production, new approaches to the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy by lowering of brain ammonia include the use of L-ornithine-L-aspartate and mild hypothermia.

The NMDA receptor requires glycine as a positive allosteric modulator. One of the glycine transporters Glyt-1 is expressed primarily in astrocytes of the cerebral cortex in association with regions of high NMDA receptor expression. As astrocytic transporters regulate the amino acid concentrations within excitatory synapses, the expression of Glyt-1 was studied in cortical preparations from rats with ischemic liver failure induced by portacaval anastomosis followed 24 hr later by hepatic artery ligation and from appropriate sham-operated controls. Expression of Glyt-1 mRNA, studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, was significantly decreased in the brain at coma stages of encephalopathy (to approximately 50% of control) concomitant with a significant threefold increase of extracellular glycine, measured by in vivo cerebral microdialysis. These findings suggest that loss of expression of the Glyt-1 transporter may cause an impairment of regulation of glycine concentration at synaptic level and contribute to an overactivation of the NMDA receptor in ALF. The use of NMDA receptor antagonists, aimed specifically at the glycine modulatory site, could offer novel approaches to the prevention and treatment of HE in ALF.

Increasing evidence suggests that astrocytes are a site of early dysfunction and damage; chronic exposure to manganese leads to selective dopaminergic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and gliosis in basal ganglia structures together with characteristic astrocytic changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis. Astrocytes possess a high affinity, high capacity, specific transport system for manganese facilitating its uptake, and sequestration in mitochondria, leading to a disruption of oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, manganese causes a number of other functional changes in astrocytes including an impairment of glutamate transport, alterations of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, production of nitric oxide, and increased densities of binding sites for the "peripheral-type" benzodiazepine receptor (a class of receptor predominantly localized to mitochondria of astrocytes and involved in oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial proliferation, and neurosteroid synthesis). Such effects can lead to compromised energy metabolism, resulting in altered cellular morphology, production of reactive oxygen species, and increased extracellular glutamate concentration. These consequences may result in impaired astrocytic-neuronal interactions and play a major role in the pathophysiology of manganese neurotoxicity.

Studies in experimental animals suggest that this beneficial effect of hypothermia is the result of a decrease in blood-brain ammonia transfer resulting in improvement in brain energy metabolism and normalization of glutamatergic synaptic regulation. Improvement in brain energy metabolism by hypothermia may result from a reduction in ammonia-induced decrease of brain glucose (pyruvate) oxidation. Restoration of normal glutamatergic synaptic regulation by hypothermia may be the consequence of the removal of ammonia-induced decreases in expression of astrocytic glutamate transporters resulting in normal glutamate neurotransmitter inactivation in brain. Randomized controlled clinical trials of hypothermia are required to further evaluate its clinical impact.

Recent evidence from rat diaphragm muscle has shown that including periods of quiescence to the stimulation protocol allows epp amplitude to recover between series of contractions. Whether similar recovery occurs in rat hindlimb muscle is unknown. In this study, we have measured declines in epp amplitude in rat soleus muscle during trains of stimulation evoked either continuously (10 s) or intermittently (400 ms repeated every second), using an in situ approach. As in diaphragm, we found that rest periods within the intermittent trains significantly improved neuromuscular transmission efficacy. However, unlike the diaphragm, epp amplitude recovery was incomplete even by the second train in the intermittent protocols, recovery being frequency-dependent and ranging from 40 to 50%. The results suggest that the kinetics of epp amplitude rundown and recovery may be muscle-specific, and should be considered when evaluating situations in which neuromuscular transmission efficacy may be altered.

We used sound stimuli selected on the basis of previous psychophysiological studies to investigate the neural correlates of timbre perception. Our results indicate that both the left and right hemispheres are involved in timbre processing, challenging the conventional notion that the elementary attributes of musical perception are predominantly lateralized to the right hemisphere. Significant timbre-related brain activation was found in well-defined regions of posterior Heschl's gyrus and superior temporal sulcus, extending into the circular insular sulcus. Although the extent of activation was not significantly different between left and right hemispheres, temporal lobe activations were significantly posterior in the left, compared to the right, hemisphere, suggesting a functional asymmetry in their respective contributions to timbre processing.

We previously demonstrated that visual analysis of a composite map based on three simple models of MRI features of FCD increased the sensitivity of FCD lesion detection, compared to visual analysis of conventional MRI. Here we report on the use of improved methods for characterizing FCD which improve contrast in the composite maps: a Laplacian-based metric for measuring cortical thickness, a convolutional kernel to model blurring of the GM-WM interface, and an operator to measure hyperintense T1 signal. To validate these methods, we processed the AIMS of 14 FCD patients with our original set of image processing operators and an improved set of image processing operators. Comparison of the composite maps associated with the two sets of operators revealed that contrast between lesional tissue and nonlesional cortex was significantly increased in the composite maps associated with the set of improved operators. Increasing this contrast is an important step toward the goal of automated FCD lesion detection. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Current explanations of the mismatch between increased blood flow and oxygen consumption during neuronal excitation hold that blood flow must rise more than oxygen consumption to compensate for a low oxygen reserve in brain mitochondria. Contrary to the result of a previous study by Mintun et al. (2001), the present test of the hypothesis revealed no conflicts among the claims of unidirectional blood-brain transfer of oxygen, negligible oxygen in mitochondria, and measurements of cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. With a simple compartmental model of oxygen delivery to brain tissue, the test showed that neuronal excitation elicits identical increases of cerebral blood flow in normoxemia and hypoxemia, in complete agreement with the claim of a negligible reserve of oxygen in brain mitochondria in vivo.

The ovarian steroids, estrogen (E) and progesterone (P), may modulate the function of the serotonergic (5-HT) system, implicated in the etiology and treatment of affective disorders. We tested the hypothesis that ovarian steroid modulation of 5-HT function could result in a modification of the 5-HT neuronal firing activity. Extracellular unitary recordings of dorsal raphe nucleus 5-HT neurons were obtained in male rats and in female rats during natural E and P fluctuations. The average firing activity of 5-HT neurons was significantly higher in males (41%) than in freely cycling (CF) and in ovariectomized (OVX) females. During pregnancy, it increased gradually and by up to 136% on gestational day 17, then declined before parturition. In the postpartum period (PP), the firing rate decreased markedly compared to P17 but remained 63% higher than in CF. During pregnancy, the firing rate variations were closely correlated with P plasmatic levels. Finally no modification of the basal firing activity of locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons was found in any group tested. Our results thus reveal a gender and pregnancy-dependent modulation of 5-HT firing rate that would impact 5-HT-mediated neurotransmission. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Moreover, during pregnancy, it increased in parallel to circulating levels of progesterone, peaking at day 17 of pregnancy (P17). In this second part, we assessed the role of three regulatory mechanisms potentially involved in these modifications of the 5-HT neurons firing activity. During pregnancy, the ED50 for the response to LSD was decreased by about 70%, indicating a partial desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, which is consistent with the 5-HT neurons higher firing activity. The GABAergic tonic inhibition of 5-HT neurons was assessed using the responses to GABA, bicuculline and isoniazid. Together, they indicate a lower GABAergic tonic inhibition in males and P17 as compared to CF, which is in agreement with their greater 5-HT neurons firing rate. Finally, the efficacy of the long feedback loop, involving postsynaptic 5-HTIA receptors, did not seem affected by gender, ovariectomy or pregnancy since the response to systemic 8-OH-DPAT was similar. These results constitute strong evidence of mechanisms by which gender and hormonal fluctuations can modulate the 5-HT neurons function and influence vulnerability to mood disorders.

PET data were analyzed using: (1) brain parametric maps to statistically generate regions of significant change; and (2) a priori identified regions of interest (ROI) manually drawn on each individual's co-registered magnetic resonance (MR) images. Compared with placebo, d-amphetamine decreased [C-11]raclopride binding potential (13P) with significant effects in ventral but not dorsal striatum, Change in BP in the statistically generated cluster correlated with self-reported drug-induced 'drug wanting' (r = 0.83, p = .01) and the personality trait Of Novelty Seeking-Exploratory Excitability (r = 0.79, p = .02). The same associations were seen in the manually drawn ROI in ventral striatum but not in dorsal putamen or caudate. Changes in extracellular dopamine (DA) did not correlate with mood. Mesolimbic DA might mediate interest in obtaining reward rather than reward, per se. Individual differences in amphetamine-induced DA release might be related to predispositions to drug and novelty seeking. (C) 2002 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

Smooth pursuit was investigated in two conditions, one in which attention was enhanced (monitoring target changes) and one in which attention was not enhanced (no monitoring). Patients with schizophrenia (n = 15) and controls (n = 14) were given a 14-mg nicotine patch in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design and plasma nicotine concentrations were monitored. Nicotine concentrations were similar in both groups. A Group X Drug interaction (P < .02) on CPT hits indicated that nicotine improved sustained attention in patients but not in controls. Nicotine significantly decreased antisaccade errors (p < .01) in both groups. A Drug X Monitoring condition interaction (p < .01) on pursuit gain indicated that nicotine significantly increased pursuit gain in the no-monitoring condition in patients and controls equally, but did not improve pursuit in the monitoring condition. Thus, improvement in pursuit may have been mediated via an effect on attention rather than by an effect on oculomotor function per se. In patients, the magnitude of improvement in attention on nicotine was correlated with the improvement on eye movement tasks. Thus, nicotine improves performance on both attention and oculomotor markers of risk for schizophrenia, possibly via common mechanisms. (C) 2002 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

However, recent studies have illustrated that the laboratory environment has a robust effect on behavioral traits. Given that environmental factors can interact with trait-relevant genes, some have questioned the reliability and generalizability of behavior genetic research designed to identify those genes. This problem might be alleviated by the identification of the most relevant environmental factors, but the task is hindered by the large number of factors that typically vary between and within laboratories. We used a computational approach to retrospectively identify and rank sources of variability in nociceptive responses as they occurred in a typical research laboratory over several years. A machine-learning algorithm was applied to an archival data set of 8034 independent observations of baseline thermal nociceptive sensitivity. This analysis revealed that a factor even more important than mouse genotype was the experimenter performing the test, and that nociception can be affected by many additional laboratory factors including season/humidity, cage density, time of day, sex and within-cage order of testing. The results were confirmed by linear modeling in a subset of the data, and in confirmatory experiments, in which we were able to partition the variance of this complex trait among genetic (27%), environmental (42%) and genetic X environmental (18%) sources.

We show here that the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the huntingtin gene plays an important role in controlling the synthesis of huntingtin. In particular, the 5' UTR contains an upstream open reading frame (uORF) encoding a 21 amino acid peptide. We demonstrate that the presence of this uORF negatively influences expression from the huntingtin mRNA. Our results suggest a role for the uORF in limiting ribosomal access to downstream initiation sites. Mechanisms involving the post-transcriptional regulation of huntingtin are not well understood, and this may be an important way of regulating huntingtin protein levels.

In addition, the effect of MK-801 on mentioned parameters was studied. Animals were exposed to 20 min global cerebral ischemia and were sacrificed immediately, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after ischemic procedure. The level of the FAA and the Na+,K+-ATPase activity was measured during all reperfusion periods examined. Various doses of MK-801 (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mg/kg) had been injected 30 min before ischemic procedure started. It was found that 20 min global cerebral ischemia induces a statistically significant increase of the FAA level immediately after ischemia and during the first 0.5 h of reperfusion. After a transient decrease, the level of FAA level increased again after 24 and 168 h of recirculation. Treatment with 3.0 mg/kg of MK-801 significantly prevented the FAA accumulation immediately and 0.5 h after ischemic insult while application of 5.0 mg/kg of MK-801 exerted a protective effect during the first 24 h. Global cerebral ischemia induces the significant decline in the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the hippocampus starting from 1 to 168 h of reperfusion. Maximal inhibition was obtained 24 h after the ischemic damage. Application of 3.0 mg/kg of MK-801 exerted statistically significant protection during the first 24 h while the treatment with 5.0 mg/kg of MK-801 prevented fall in enzymatic activity during all reperfusion periods examined. Our results suggest that, in spite of different and complex pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the increase of FAA level and the decrease of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity, blockade of NMDA receptor subtype provides a very important strategy for the treatment of the postischemic excitotoxicity.

Their synchronization with daily light cycles involves neural connections from light-sensitive photoreceptor-containing retinal ganglion cells. This clock orchestrates rhythmic expression for similar to10% of the SCN gene transcripts, of which only 10% are also rhythmically expressed in other tissues. Many of the transcripts expressed rhythmically only in the SCN are involved in neurosecretion, and their secreted products could mediate SCN control over physiological rhythms by coordinating rhythmicity in other nuclei within the brain. The coordination of clock gene transcript oscillations in peripheral tissues could be controlled directly by specific signals or indirectly by rhythmic behavior such as feeding.

Because predominantly brain-derived proteins such as tau, have higher ventricle to lumbar ratios, we hypothesized that adjusting for the ventricular enlargement of AD would correct for the dilution of tau, and improve detection of longitudinal change. Abeta which is not exclusively brain derived, shows a ratio <1, and no benefit was expected from adjustment. In a 1 year longitudinal study of eight MCI and ten controls, we examined CSF levels of hyperphosphorylated (P) tau231, A&beta;40, and A&beta;42. In cross-section, MCI patients showed elevated Ptau231 and A&beta;40 levels, and greater ventricular volumes. Longitudinally, only after adjusting for the ventricular volume and only for Ptau231, were increases seen in MCI. Further studies are warranted on mechanisms of tau clearance and on using imaging to interpret CSF studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Female 16-month-old APP23 transgenic mice were compared to age-matched non-transgenic mice in behavioral tests measuring spatial learning, exploration of environmental stimuli, anxiety, and motor coordination. APP23 transgenic mice had fewer fast ambulatory movements, either fast or slow stereotypy movements, and slow rears in a photocell activity chamber. The acquisition of spatial learning in the Morris water maze was impaired in APP23 transgenic mice, but not during the probe test or while swimming towards a visible platform. Neither were there intergroup differences in tests of anxiety or motor coordination. These results indicate that a learning deficit and hypoactivity, concordant with the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, characterize this mouse model with AP accumulation.

In the present study, we used a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model in Wistar rats to analyze the influence of unilateral CNS ischemia on spleen cell number and function. The occlusion time was 1 h, followed by reperfusion with survival for 0, 2, 7, 14, and 28 days. Changes in plasma norepinephrine levels were used as an index of peripheral sympathetic activity. Results showed that the total number of spleen cells significantly decreased after 2-28 days of survival in animals with cerebral ischemia compared to sham-operated controls. There was no change in the percentage of CD5(+)-CD4(+) T cells, MHC class II+ cells, or ED1(+) macrophages. However, the percentage of CD5(+)-CD8(+) T cells decreased at 2 days, resulting in an increased CD4/CD8 ratio, and both parameters returned to control levels after 7 days. Mitogen-induced T and B lymphocyte proliferation increased after 0-28 days post-ischemia independently of the mitogen used. There was no difference in immune response or norepinephrine levels between left and right MCA occlusions. These results are consistent with the notion that cerebral ischemia induces mobilization of certain immune cells from the periphery to the brain, where they may contribute to the local inflammatory response. Additionally, the data indicate that cerebral ischemia is followed by a systemic activation of T and B lymphocytes. Absence of asymmetric effects of left versus right stroke, and failure to demonstrate any suppressive effects of left-sided lesions on lymphocyte proliferation, probably reflects the fact that these large cerebral ischemic lesions affect both cortical and subcortical areas.

Our previous studies indicated that BDNF blocked the cytotoxic effects of vinblastine on NB cells. Here we evaluated the ability of BDNF to decrease the chemosensitivity of NB cells to a number of common chemotherapeutic agents. Two SH-SY5Y NB cell lines (TB3 and TB8) expressing TrkB under the control of a tetracycline (Tet)-repressible promoter element were generated, and used to assess apoptosis resulting from treatment with cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, and vinblastine. BDNF treatment of high TrkB-expressing TB8 (Tet-) and TB3 (Tet-) cells blocked drug-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Only high-dose BDNF (100 ng/ml) could block the effects of chemotherapy in low TrkB-expressing cells. The ability of BDNF to rescue the cells from chemotherapeutic agent-induced cell death was inhibited by treatment with the Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a or the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, but not by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 or the peritoneal lymphocyte gamma inhibitor U73122, indicating that both TrkB and PI3K activities are required for the survival-promoting effects of BDNF. BDNF also protected TrkB-expressing NGP and KCNR NB cells from chemotherapeutic agent-induced cell death, and LY294002 inhibited this protection. These results suggest that TrkB and BDNF can contribute to the chemoresistance of poor prognosis tumors, and that suppression of PI3K activity might improve the ability of these agents to induce the death of NB tumors.

We found recently that sensory-evoked responses are suppressed in the neocortex during arousal. This sensory suppression results from the activity-dependent depression of the thalamocortical connection caused by increased tonic firing of thalamocortical cells during arousal. In the present study, the functional consequences of thalamocortical suppression during arousal were investigated using the vibrissae system of rodents. The results show that thalamocortical suppression is associated with a strong reduction in the spread of sensory inputs through the cortex, thus reducing the size of sensory representations. In addition, when the responses of single cells to principal and adjacent whiskers are compared, the response to the adjacent whiskers was found to be strongly suppressed, much more so than that of principal whiskers. Consequently, the receptive fields of cortical neurons become more focused to the principal whisker. The results indicate that thalamocortical suppression during arousal serves to focus sensory inputs to their appropriate representations in neocortex, which may be computationally helpful for the spatial processing of sensory information.

Although cannabinoid receptors are distributed widely in brain, their presence has not been investigated previously in oligodendrocytes. This study examined the expression of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors in rat oligodendrocytes in vivo and in culture and explored their biological function. Expression of CB1 receptors by oligodendrocytes was demonstrated immunocytochemically in postnatal and in adult white matter as well as in oligodendrocyte cultures. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting further confirmed the presence of CB1 receptors. Oligodendrocyte progenitors undergo apoptosis with the withdrawal of trophic support, as determined by TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activation, and both the selective CB1 agonist arachidonyl-2'-chloroethylamide/( all Z)- N-(2-cycloethyl)-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenamide (ACEA) and the nonselective cannabinoid agonists HU210 and (+)-Win-55212-2 enhanced cell survival. To investigate intracellular signaling involved in cannabinoid protection, we focused on the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. HU210, (+)-Win-55212-2, and ACEA elicited a time-dependent phosphorylation of Akt. Pertussis toxin abolished Akt activation, indicating the involvement of G(i)/G(o)-protein-coupled receptors. The CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A partially inhibited Akt phosphorylation in response to HU210 and (+) Win- 55212-2 and abolished the effects of ACEA. Trophic support deprivation downregulated Akt activity, and cannabinoids recovered phospho-Akt levels. Inhibition of PI3K abrogated the survival action and the recovery of Akt activity in response to cannabinoids. SR141716A prevented only the protection conferred by ACEA. Nevertheless, SR141716A and the selective CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528 in combination inhibited the prosurvival action of HU210, which is in accordance with the finding of CB2 receptor expression by oligodendroglial cells. These data identify oligodendrocytes as potential targets of cannabinoid action in the CNS.

In p73(-/-) animals, cortical neuron number is normal at birth but decreases significantly by postnatal day 14 (P14)-P16 because of enhanced apoptosis. This decrease continues into adulthood, when p73(-/-) animals have approximately one-half as many cortical cells as their wild-type littermates. Cortical neurons express the DeltaNp73alpha protein, and overexpression of DeltaNp73 isoforms rescues cortical neurons from diverse apoptotic stimuli. Thus, DeltaNp73 isoforms are survival proteins in cortical neurons, and their deletion causes a gradual loss of cortical neurons in the weeks and months after birth. This decrease in CNS neuron number in p73(-/-) animals is not limited to the cortex; facial motor neuron number is decreased, and postnatal development of the olfactory bulb is greatly perturbed. These findings, together with our previous work showing that DeltaNp73 is essential for survival of peripheral sympathetic neurons (Pozniak et al., 2000), indicate that p73 isoforms are essential survival proteins in CNS as well as PNS neurons, and that they likely play a role not only during developmental cell death but also in the long-term maintenance of at least some adult neurons.

Persistent neuronal activity is the elementary process underlying working memory but its cellular basis remains unknown. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that persistent activity is based on synaptic reverberations in recurrent circuits. The entorhinal cortex in the parahippocampal region is crucially involved in the acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of long-term memory traces for which working memory operations are essential(2). Here we show that individual neurons from layer V of the entorhinal cortex-which link the hippocampus to extensive cortical regions(3)-respond to consecutive stimuli with graded changes in firing frequency that remain stable after each stimulus presentation. In addition, the sustained levels of firing frequency can be either increased or decreased in an input-specific manner. This firing behaviour displays robustness to distractors; it is linked to cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation, and relies on activity-dependent changes of a Ca2+-sensitive cationic current. Such an intrinsic neuronal ability to generate graded persistent activity constitutes an elementary mechanism for working memory.

Here, we have defined a signaling cascade, 6 MEK-C/EBP pathway, that is essential for cortical progenitor cells to become post-mitotic neurons. Inhibition of MEK or of the C/EBP family of transcription factors inhibits neurogenesis while expression of a C/EBPbeta mutant that is a phosphorylation-mimic at a MEK-Rsk site enhances neurogenesis. C/EBP mediates this positive effect by direct transcriptional I activation of neuron-specific genes such as Talpha1 alpha-tubulin. Conversely, inhibition of C/EBP-dependent transcription enhances CNTF-mediated generation of astrocytes from the same progenitor cells. Thus, activation of a MEK-C/EBP pathway enhances neurogenesis and inhibits gliogenesis, thereby providing a mechanism whereby growth factors can selectively bias progenitors to become neurons during development.

Nevertheless, the frequency of pain dreams in healthy subjects is low. This prospective study was designed to evaluate the occurrence and frequency of pain in the dreams of patients suffering from burn pain. Twenty-eight nonventilated burn victims were interviewed for 5 consecutive mornings during the first week of hospitalization. A structured-interview protocol was used to collect information on dream content, quality of sleep, and pain intensity and location. Patients were also administered the Impact of Event Scale to assess posttraumatic symptoms. Thirty-nine percent of patients reported 19 pain dreams on a total of 63 dreams (30%). Patients with pain dreams showed evidence of worse sleep, more nightmares, higher intake of anxiolytic medication, and higher scores on the Impact of Event Scale than did patients reporting dreams with no pain content. Moreover, patients with pain dreams also had a tendency to report more intense pain during therapeutic procedures. Although more than half of our sample did not report pain dreams, these results suggest that pain dreams do occur at a greater frequency in suffering populations than in normal volunteers. More importantly, dreaming about pain may be an added stress for burn patients and may contribute to both poor sleep and higher pain intensity, which could evolve into a cycle of pain-anxiety-sleeplessness.

A previous report suggested that DA and 5-HT afferents each account for at least 30% of nicotinic binding sites in the striatum. To explore this question further, rats received unilateral infusions of the neurotoxins 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, 6-hydroxydopamine or vehicle into the medial forebrain bundle, and were sacrificed 3 weeks later. Denervation was quantified by [(125) I]RTI-55 autoradiography, using separate assay conditions that revealed DA and 5-HT transporters (i.e. DAT and SERT). Nicotinic cholinoceptors were quantified by [(125) I]epibatidine autoradiography. Infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine depleted DAT but not SERT labelling in all striatal areas (i.e. caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens core and shell, olfactory tubercle). The serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine depleted SERT and, to a lesser extent, DAT labelling. Both neurotoxins reduced [(125) I]epibatidine binding in striatal areas. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that these reductions in [(125) I]epibatidine binding were entirely associated with loss of DAT rather than SERT. The DAT-associated proportion of total [(125) I]epibatidine binding was 36 +/- 2% (caudate-putamen), 28 +/- 3% (accumbens core), 27 +/- 4% (accumbens shell) and 44 +/- 5% (olfactory tubercle). Cortical [(125) I]epibatidine binding was unaltered by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions that reduced SERT labelling by 46 to 73%. In all brain areas, even small (3.4 to 8.8%) SERT-associated reductions in [I-125]epibatidine binding would have been detected as statistically significant. In conclusion, we report the failure to detect nAChRs on 5-HT terminals in extended striatum or cerebral cortex, using a sensitive [I-125]epibatidine autoradiographic assay.

The recently cloned NHE5 isoform is expressed predominantly in brain, but its functional and cellular properties are poorly understood. To facilitate its characterization, an epitope-tagged construct of NHE5 was ectopically expressed in nonneuronal and neuronal cells. In NHE-deficient Chinese hamster ovary AP-1 cells, NHE5 localized at the plasmalemma, but a significant fraction accumulated intracellularly in vesicles that concentrated in a juxtanuclear region. Similarly, in nerve growth factor-differentiated neuroendocrine PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons, immunolabeling of NHE5 was detected in endomembrane vesicles in the perinuclear region of the cell body but also along the processes. More detailed characterization in AP-1 cells using organelle-specific markers showed that NHE5 colocalized with internalized transferrin, a marker of recycling endosomes. Transient transfection of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin-1, which inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis, blocked uptake of transferrin as well as internalization of NHE5. Likewise, wortmannin inhibition of phosphatidylinositol X-kinase, a lipid kinase implicated in endosomal traffic, induced coalescence of vesicles containing NHE5 and caused a pronounced inhibition of plasmalemmal Na+/H+ exchange. By contrast, disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D increased cell surface NHE5 activity and abundance. These observations demonstrate that NHE5 is localized to the recycling endosomal pathway and is dynamically regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and by the state of F-actin assembly.

In addition, both pre-clinical and clinical evidence have suggested that NPY, together with its receptors, may have a direct implication in several psychiatric disorders, including depression and related illnesses. NPY-like immunoreactivity and NPY receptors are expressed throughout the brain, with varying concentrations being found throughout the limbic system. Such brain structures have been repeatedly implicated in the modulation of emotional processing, as well as in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders. This review will concentrate on the distribution of NPY, its receptors, and the putative role played by this peptide in depressive illness based on both pre-clinical and clinical evidence.

Stimuli were manipulated such that for half of each set, segmentation of the syllable was required for a discrimination decision; for the other half of the stimuli, no phonological segmentation was required. Results revealed impaired consonant voicing and vowel discrimination in a group of left-hemi sphere-damaged non-fluent aphasic participants. Discrimination accuracy for groups of fluent aphasic participants and right-hemisphere-damaged participants fell between those of the non-fluent aphasic participants and the normal controls on both tasks. The findings are suggestive of a role for left frontal lobe regions in phonological segmentation, but remain inconclusive on this issue. The results are considered in relation to models of the neural bases and cerebral lateralization of speech perception processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Subjects, at least 9 years old, completed a battery of French or English language tests, including derivational morphology, verb tense morphology, grammaticality judgement, syntactic comprehension, and pointing. listening comprehension and WUG pluralization test were analyzed only in the English group. The verb tense morphology (real words) and verb tense morphology (non-real words), respectively, showed non-parametric sibling correlations of 0.39 and 0.35 (p < 0.05, two-tailed) in 38 pairs (mixed gender) from ten French test pedigrees. In the English group, derivational morphology showed significant 0.52 correlation in 41 sibling pairs from the densely affected FE pedigree. After controlling for age, sibling correlation for verb tense morphology (real words) remained significant, and derivational morphology correlation in the FE pedigree was borderline (p = 0.05). Impaired grammatical morphology is a predominant aspect of SLI, and the present study, which requires independent replication, suggests that verb tense morphology and derivational morphology warrant particular attention in future familial and genetic studies.

This advantage is thought to magnify with increased duration of exposure. In addition, SEVO has several of the characteristics of an ideal neuroanesthetic. We designed a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to compare the recovery profile of SEVO versus ISO in neurosurgery. Sixty patients undergoing intracranial surgery were enrolled. They were randomized to receive SEVO or ISO in 40% oxygen as part of a balanced anesthetic regimen. The anesthetic concentration (0.5 to 1.0 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration [MAC]) was adjusted to maintain mean arterial blood pressure within 20% of the preinduction baseline. At the end of the surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed, anesthetics were discontinued without prior tapering, and fresh gas flow was increased to 10 L/min. Recovery end-points were measured as the time from closure of the anesthetic vaporizer. Mean MAC-hours were identical in both groups (4.7). Patients in the SEVO group demonstrated a shorter time to emergence (P = 0.02) and for response to command (squeeze hand, P = 0.03; move feet, P = 0.01). Patients in the SEVO group obtained a Glasgow coma scale score of greater than or equal to105 min before patients in the ISO group (P = 0.04). Obtaining an early neurological examination can be critical in neurosurgical patients. The observed difference in emergence between SEVO and ISO could therefore be of clinical importance.

A quantitative model describing the concentration-effect relation of succinylcholine was proposed. The correlation between in vitro hydrolysis in plasma and in vivo elimination was also examined. Methods: Before induction of anesthesia, blood was drawn for in vitro analysis in seven adults. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil. Single twitch stimulation was applied at the ulnar nerve every 10 s, and the force of contraction of the adductor pollicis was measured. Arterial blood was drawn frequently after succinylcholine injection to characterize the front-end kinetics. Plasma concentrations were measured by mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using compartmental and noncompartmental approaches. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relations were estimated. Results. The mean in vitro degradation rate constant in plasma (1.07 +/- 0.49 min(-1)) was not different from the in vivo elimination rate constant (0.97 +/- 0.30 min(-1)), and an excellent correlation (r(2) = 0.94) was observed. Total body clearance derived using noncompartmental (37 +/- 7 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) and compartmental (37 +/- 9 ml.min(-1).kg(-1)) approaches were similar. The plasma-effect compartment equilibration rate constant (K-eo) was 0.058 +/- 0.026 min(-1), and the effect compartment concentration at 50% block was 734 +/- 211 ng/ml. Conclusion: Succinylcholine is a low-potency drug with a very fast clearance that equilibrates relatively slowly with the effect compartment. Its in vivo disappearance is greatly accountable by a rapid hydrolysis in plasma.

A pathological hallmark of both sporadic and familial ALS is the presence of abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and peripherin proteins in motor neurons. In the past decade, transgenic mouse approaches have been used to address the role of such cytoskeletal abnormalities in motor neuron disease and also to unravel the pathogenesis caused by mutations in the gene coding for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) that account for similar to20% of familial ALS cases. In mouse models, disparate effects could result from different types of intermediate filament (IF) aggregates. Perikaryal IF accumulations induced by the overexpression of any of the three wild-type neurofilament proteins were quite well tolerated by motor neurons. Indeed, perikaryal swellings provoked by NF-H overexpression can even confer protection against toxicity of mutant SOD1. Other types of IF aggregates seem neurotoxic, such as those found in transgenic mice overexpressing either peripherin or an assembly-disrupting NF-L mutant. Moreover, understanding the toxicity of SOD1 mutations has been surprisingly difficult. The analysis of transgenic mice expressing mutant SOD1 has yielded complex results, suggesting that multiple pathways may contribute to disease that include the involvement of non-neuronal cells.

The syndrome is usually associated with mutations in the doublecortin (DCX) (Xq22.3-q23) gene, and much less frequently in the LIS1 (17p13.3) gene. To determine whether the phenotypic spectrum, the genetic basis and genotype-phenotype correlations of SBH in males are similar to those in females, we compared the clinical, imaging and molecular features in 30 personally evaluated males and 60 previously reported females with SBH. Based on the MRI findings, we defined the following band subtypes: partial, involving one or two cerebral lobes; intermediate, involving two lobes and a portion of a third; diffuse, with substantial involvement of three or more lobes; and pachygyria-SBH, in which posterior SBH merges with anterior pachygyria. Karyo typing and mutation analysis of DCX and/or LIS1 were performed in 23 and 24 patients, respectively. The range of clinical phenotypes in males with SBH greatly overlapped that in females. MRI studies revealed that some anatomical subtypes of SBH, such as partial and intermediate posterior, pachygyria-SBH and diffuse bands with posterior predominance, were more frequently or exclusively present in males. Conversely, classical diffuse SBH and diffuse bands with anterior predominance were more frequent in females. Males had either mild or the most severe band subtypes, and these correlated with the over-representation of normal/borderline intelligence and severe mental retardation, respectively. Conversely, females who had predominantly diffuse bands exhibited mostly mild or moderate mental retardation. Seven patients (29%) had missense mutations in DCX; in four, these were germline mutations, whereas in three there was evidence for somatic mosaicism. A germline missense mutation of LIS1 and a partial trisomy of chromosome 9p were identified in one patient (4%) each. One male each had a possible pathogenic intronic base change in both DCX and LIS1 genes. Our study shows that SBH in males is a clinically heterogeneous syndrome, mostly occurring sporadically. The clinical spectrum is similar to that of females with SBH. However, the greater cognitive and neuroradiological heterogeneity and the small number of mutations identified to date in the coding sequences of the DCX and LIS1 genes in males differ from the findings in females. This suggests other genetic mechanisms such as mutations in the non-coding regions of the DCX or LIS1 genes, gonadal or somatic mosaicism, and finally mutations of other genes.

J	Baum, SR				Baum, SR			Sensitivity to sub-syllabic constituents in brain-damaged patients: evidence from word games	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							AUDITORY LEXICAL ACCESS; PHONETIC CATEGORIZATION; SPEECH; APHASIA; ERRORS; PHONOLOGY; ENGLISH; ONSETS; SOUND; RHYME	Two experiments were conducted to examine whether left- (LHD) and right-hemisphere-damaged (RHD) patients exhibit sensitivity to sub-syllabic constituents (i.e., onsets and codas) in the generation of nonwords, using a word games paradigm adapted from Treiman (1983). Four groups of individuals (including LHD fluent and nonfluent aphasic patients, RHD patients and normal controls) were trained to add syllables to monosyllabic CVC nonwords either after the initial consonant (Experiment 1) or prior to the final consonant (Experiment 2) to create bisyllabic nonwords. Experimental stimuli consisting of CCVC or CVCC nonwords tested whether participants would preserve or split the onset and coda constituents in producing the novel bisyllabic nonwords. Results revealed that the majority of subjects demonstrated sensitivity to the sub-syllabic constituents, preserving the onsets and codas. The fluent aphasic patients exhibited a greater than normal tendency to split the onset and coda constituents; however, the small number of individuals in that group whose data met inclusion criteria limits the conclusions that may be drawn from these findings. The results are discussed in relation to theories of phonological deficits in aphasia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

J	Kaur, G; Heera, PK; Srivastava, LK				Kaur, G; Heera, PK; Srivastava, LK			Neuroendocrine plasticity in GnRH release during rat estrous cycle: correlation with molecular markers of synaptic remodeling	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						GnRH; neuronal plasticity; hypothalamus; estrous cycle; rat; neural cell adhesion molecule; immunohistochemistry	CELL-ADHESION MOLECULE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; POLYSIALIC ACID; HORMONE NEURONS; MEDIAN-EMINENCE; ADULT-RAT; MORPHOLOGICAL PLASTICITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GONADOTROPIN; NCAM	Morphological changes in the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the preoptic area (POA) and their terminals in the median eminence-arcuate (ME-ARC) region are reported to occur during ovarian cycle that may be involved in the GnRH release into the portal blood during preovulatory surge. However, the neuronal substrates participating in altered GnRH neuronal plasticity are poorly understood. The present study was designed to determine whether morphological changes occurring in the GnRH neuron cell bodies in the POA and their terminals in the ME-ARC region of hypothalamus with pulsatile GnRH release in cycling female rats are associated with expression of intrinsic determinants of neuronal plasticity. The plasticity markers studied are polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), high molecular weight isoforms of NCAM, growth associated protein (GAP-43), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and synaptophysin. Regularly cycling female rats were sacrificed at diestrous, i.e., when GnRH release is low, and at proestrous, i.e., when preovulatory GnRH surge occurs, using perfusion fixation method for immunohistochemical staining of GnRH cells. GnRH cell bodies and their terminals from the POA and ME-ARC region respectively, were localized using immunohistochemical technique in proestrous and diestrous phase of estrous cycle and our results showed a marked increase in the GnRH nerve terminals length and immunoreactivity in the ME-ARC region from proestrous phase rats as compared to diestrous rats. Immunoblot analyses of the POA and ME-ARC region of the hypothalamus revealed a significant increase in the content of PSA-NCAM, NCAM-180, NCAM-140, GAP-43 and synaptophysin from proestrous phase rats as compared to diestrous phase rats. The ME-ARC region showed more pronounced increase in the protein expression of these markers of neuronal plasticity as compared to the POA, whereas, hippocampal region did not show any significant change in the content of these markers showing specificity of the changes to the GnRH system. GFAP content was significantly decreased in the POA with a marginal increase in the GFAP level from the ME-ARC region. These results demonstrate the involvement of synaptic proteins in the dynamic plasticity of the ME-ARC region of hypothalamus, allowing GnRH nerve terminals to release the neurohormone into the pituitary portal blood on the day of proestrous.

The time course of this interaction was studied by measuring mivacurium infusion rates during sevoflurane, isoflurane and propofol anesthesia. Methods: After informed consent, anesthesia was induced in 48 ASA physical status I-II adults with propofol, fentanyl and mivacurium 0.25 mg.kg(-1) and maintained with N2O (60%) and one of the three agents chosen at random: sevoflurane 1.9%; isoflurane 1.2%; or propofol 100-150 mug.kg(-1).min(-1). Train-of-four stimulation was applied every 15 sec to the ulnar nerve. Neuromuscular blockade was monitored with accelerometry. At 5% recovery of the first twitch (TI), a mivacurium infusion was started and adjusted every five minutes to maintain 90-95% TI depression. Results: The time to 5% TI recovery after the initial dose was similar in all groups (13-15 min). Fifteen minutes after the start of the infusion mivacurium requirements were greater (P < 0.05) in the propofol group (7.5 +/- 1.7 mug.kg(-1).min(-1); mean +/- SD) than in either isoflurane (4.7 +/- 1.6 mug.kg-1. min(-1)) or sevoflurane (4.5 +/- 1.5 mug.kg(-1).min(-1)) group. Then, the rate remained stable for propofol (6.2 +/- 1.4 mug.kg(-1).min(-1) after 90 min of infusion) while it decreased with isoflurane to 2.9 +/- 1.6 mug.kg(-1).min(-1) at 90 min (P < 0.05 vs propofol) and to 1.4 +/- 1.0 mug.kg(-1). min(-1) in the sevoflurane group (P < 0.05 vs propofol and isoflurane). Conclusion: Sevoflurane and isoflurane do not prolong the effect of a bolus dose of mivacurium, but potentiation increases with time from 30-105 min of exposure. This interaction is greater with sevoflurane than isoflurane.

The effect of the duration of control stimulation on the onset and duration of blockade was investigated using PMG and acceleromyography (AMG). Methods: After induction of anesthesia, a microphone was placed above the middle portion of the left eyebrow, and an acceleromyographic probe was placed above the middle portion of the right eyebrow. Twenty patients were randomized to receive bilateral, single-twitch, facial nerve stimulation (0.1 Hz, 20 mA) with three minutes (n = 10) or ten minutes (n = 10) of supr-amaximal stimulation before mivacurium 0.2 mg.kg(-1) was administered. Onset, maximum effect, and offset of NMB were measured. Results: Using PMG, lag time, onset time, maximum effect, and time to reach 75% of control twitch height (mean +/- SD) were 36 +/- 27 sec, 136 +/- 35 sec, 89 +/- 10%, and 12.1 +/- 4.5 min, respectively, after three minutes of control stimulation and were 40 22 sec, 122 +/- 40 sec, 93 +/- 3%, and 12.4 +/- 4.9 min, after ten minutes. Using AMG, the valueswere 38 +/- 23 sec, 106 +/- 28 sec, 79 +/- 6%, and 14.3 +/- 5.9 min, respectively, after three minutes and were 34 +/- 22 sec, 106 +/- 28 sec, 76 +/- 10%, and 14.9 +/- 3.7 min, after ten minutes. Compared to PMG, AMG revealed significant bias for onset time (-30 sec), maximum effect (-16%) and time to reach 75% of control twitch height (1.5 min), with wide limits of agreement of 66 sec, 22%, and 5.6 min, respectively. Conclusion: The duration of control stimulation did not influence the time course of blockade measured by either method. Three minutes of supramaximal stimulation is sufficient to measure pharmacodynamic parameters. AMG measures a shorter onset and longer recovery time and reduced anesthesiology the maximum effect compared to PMG.

Methods: Invited neurological experts from Canada, the USA, and Europe; and representatives of provincial and territorial licensing bodies, the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators, the Canadian Medical Protective Association, and the Canadian Medical Association participated. An edited version of transcribed audiotapes was prepared. Specific issues discussed were whether or not a physician should be required to report a patient with epilepsy to the licensing authority (mandatory reporting), the nature and quantification of the risks posed by epileptic drivers, and what would be a reasonable law regulating driving by people with epilepsy in Canada. Results: The consensus among medical experts was that mandatory reporting should be abolished in Canada and that a 6-12 month seizure-free period was appropriate before most patients could return to driving private cars. Experts also believed that these standards should be uniform across Canada. There was strong disagreement with the recommendation of the Canadian Medical Association that all such drivers be reported to provincial licensing authorities even in provinces without mandatory reporting rules. Conclusions: Physicians should be familiar with and follow the rules regarding epilepsy and driving in the provinces where they practice. Nevertheless, current evidence is against mandatory physician reporting of drivers with epilepsy and the neurologists recommended that this be abolished throughout Canada. Shorter seizure-free intervals should also be considered before resuming driving of private cars.

Design: Retrospective survey. Participants: Three hundred eighty Canadian university football and 240 Canadian university soccer players reporting to 1999 fall training camp. Of these, 328 football and 201 soccer players returned a completed questionnaire. Main Outcome Measures: Based on self-reported symptoms, calculations were made to determine the number of concussions experienced during the previous full year of football or soccer participation, the duration of symptoms, the time for return to play, and any associated risk factors for concussions. Results: Of all the athletes who returned completed questionnaires, 70.4% of the football players and 62.7% of the soccer players had experienced symptoms of a concussion during the previous year. Only 23.4% of the concussed football players and 19.8% of the concussed soccer players realized they had suffered a concussion. More than one concussion was experienced by 84.6% of the concussed football players and 81.7% of the concussed soccer players. Examining symptom duration, 27.6% of all concussed football players and 18.8% of all concussed soccer players experienced symptoms for at least 1 day or longer. Tight end and defensive lineman were the positions most commonly affected in football, while goalies were the players most commonly affected in soccer. Variables that increased the odds of suffering a concussion during the previous year for football players included a history of a traumatic loss of consciousness or a recognized concussion in the past. Variables that increased the odds of suffering a concussion during the previous year for soccer players included a past history of a recognized concussion while playing soccer and being female. Conclusions: University football and soccer players seem to be experiencing a significant amount of concussions while participating in their respective sports. Variables that seem to increase the odds of suffering a concussion during the previous year for football and soccer players include a history of a recognized concussion. Despite being relatively common, symptoms of concussion may not be recognized by many players.

In this article, we propose and review p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) as a building block used in the design of drugs or drug candidates. PABA is frequently found as a structure moiety in drugs. For example, in a database of 12111 commercial drugs, 1.5% (184 drugs) were found to contain the PABA moiety. These drugs have a wide range of therapeutic uses, such as: sun-screening, antibacterial, antineoplastic, local anesthetic, anticonvulsant, antiarrhythmic, anti-emetic, gastrokinetic, antipsychotic, neuroleptic, and migraine prophylactic. This article reviews the molecular targets and the mechanisms of these activities. Drugs containing PABA also show a wide range of structural diversity. Of the 184 PABA containing drugs identified, 95 different substitutions were found at the carboxylic group and 61 were found at the amino group of the building block. Substitution on the aromatic ring was also diverse. 13, 3, and 13 different side chains were found to modify positions 2, 3 and 5 of the aromatic ring respectively. In some drugs, the amino group is further substituted to form tertiary amine (4 different side chains). Substitutions at the carboxyl and amino groups of PABA are particularly suitable for the generation of combinatorial libraries. Just by reshuffling the identified side chains of the 184 PABA containing drugs, 4.5 million compounds can be generated. Consequently, PABA fits well as a building block for a general chemical library of "drug-like" molecules with a wide range of functional and structural diversity.

We investigated whether the class I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist 1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA) is neuroprotective in the KA model of epilepsy. Methods: Immature rats aged postnatal day 20 (P20) and P30 were injected with fixed volumes of KA, KA + AIDA, AIDA, or saline. We monitored recurrent seizures. Thirty days later, we tested hippocampal function with the Morris water-maze test or prepared hippocampal slices to record extracellularly evoked and spontaneous potentials from the CA1 area. In a third group, we performed neuronal counts. Results: In both age groups, acute seizures were similar in KA and KA + AIDA groups. Rare spontaneous recurrent seizures occurred only in KA-injected rats. The KA P20 group performed significantly worse than controls in the water-maze test. The KA + AIDA group showed impaired performance on day 1, but learning improved substantially, reaching control values in the remaining 3 days. The P30 KA rats performed worse than controls on all trial days, whereas the KA + AIDA rats improved by day 3, but did not reach control values. Electrophysiologic recordings showed small but consistent differences between KA and control animals, suggestive of an adaptive modification in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system, reversed by AIDA. On histology, we observed a loss of CA1 interneurons in both ages. Cell loss was reversed by the use of AIDA. Conclusions: Blockade of the class I mGIuR during KA-induced seizures in the developing brain limits seizure-induced hippocampal dysfunction.

Mutations in the CHAC gene on 9q21 were recently found to cause chorea-acanthocytosis. CHAC encodes a large, novel protein with a yeast homologue implicated in protein sorting. In this study, all 73 exons plus flanking intronic sequence in CHAC were screened for mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography in 43 probands with ChAc. We identified 57 different mutations, 54 of which have not previously been reported, in 39 probands. The novel mutations comprise 15 nonsense, 22 insertion/ deletion, 15 splice-site and two missense mutations and are distributed throughout the CHAC gene. Three mutations were found in multiple families within this or our previous study. The preponderance of mutations that are predicted to cause absence of gene product is consistent with the recessive inheritance of this disease. The high proportion of splice-site mutations found is probably a reflection of the large number of exons that comprise the CHAC gene. The CHAC protein product, chorein, appears to have a certain tolerance to amino-acid substitutions since only two out of nine substitutions described here appear to be pathogenic.

The aim of this work was to assess the content and modulation of sGC in brain in chronic liver failure in humans. Expression of the alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta-1 subunits of sGC was measured by immunoblotting in autopsied frontal cortex and cerebellum from cirrhotic patients and controls. The contents of alpha-1 and alpha-2 subunits of guanylate cyclase was increased both in cortex and cerebellum, whereas the beta-1 subunit was not affected. Addition of the NO-generating agent S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) to homogenates of frontal cortex from controls increased the activity of sGC 87-fold, whereas, in homogenates from cirrhotic patients, the increase was significantly higher (183-fold). In contrast, in cerebellum, activation of guanylate cyclase by NO was significantly lower in patients (156-fold) than in controls (248-fold). A similar regional difference was found in rats with portacaval anastomosis. In conclusion, these findings show that the NO-guanylate cyclase signal transduction pathway is strongly altered in brain in patients with chronic liver failure and that the effects are different in different brain areas. Given that activation of sGC by NO in brain is involved in the modulation of important cerebral processes such as intercellular communication, learning and memory, and the sleep-wake cycle, these changes could be implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy in these patients.

INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						mirtazapine; mania; norepinephrine; noradrenergic; adverse effects	SEROTONIN SYNDROME; AUGMENTATION; DEPRESSION; HYPOMANIA; SAFETY	The antidepressant mirtazapine antagonizes central presynaptic alpha(2)-adrenergic auto- and heteroreceptors resulting in increased central norepinephrine and serotonin activity. Histamine H, receptors are also antagonized, as are postsynaptic serotonin 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors, leading to serotonergic activity primarily via 5-HT1A receptors. Based on the case report of a patient who developed mania with higher than recommended dosage of mirtazapine, we review the literature on the atypical nature of manic symptoms with mirtazapine. Eight subjects, including those in our study, were identified as having developed mirtazapine-induced mania with atypical features, consisting of dysphoria, irritability, insomnia, psychomotor agitation and abnormal gait. Predisposing features may have included the presence of underlying brain dysfunction and certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitormirtazapine combinations. Dysphoric mania with atypical features may be induced by mirtazapine, providing support for a common hypothesis such as 'central norepinephrine hyperactivity' as the basis for development of mania with mirtazapine.

J	Braun, CMJ; Villeneuve, L; Gruzelier, JH				Braun, CMJ; Villeneuve, L; Gruzelier, JH			Topographical analysis of stimulus-related and response-related electrical scalp activity and interhemispheric dynamics in normal humans	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						interhemispheric transfer; relay; evoked response potential; movement; response; potential; Poffenberger; simple reaction time	VISUAL-EVOKED-RESPONSE; SIMPLE REACTION-TIMES; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; TRANSMISSION TIME; FLASHES; CORTEX; FIELD; BRAIN; AREAS	It is believed that reaction time estimates of interhemispheric relay (IHR) time or accuracy cost reflect motor relay and that visual evoked response potential (ERP) estimates reflect visual relay (Brown and Jeeves, 1993). If this is so, then response-related ERP estimates of IHR might be expected to correlate more with reaction time (RT) estimates of IHR than visual ERPs do, and the former ought to interact with the latter. A simple reaction time experiment (Poffenberger paradigm) was carried out with an 18-electrode montage on 10 normal subjects to investigate visual and motor interhemispheric relay effects and their interrelation. Three components in stimulus-synchronized and three other components in response-synchronized averaged signals were analyzed. Latencies and amplitudes of these components were studied as a function of the visual field stimulated and the hand required to respond. Effects interpretable as interhemispheric relay effects were observed in stimulus-related as well as response-related components. Few interhemispheric relay effect estimates in stimulus-related and response-related electrical scalp potentials were related to behavioral estimates of interhemispheric relay effects (derived from reaction times and omission errors). The spatiotemporal distributions of the electrical interhemispheric relay effects differed in stimulus and response-related components and they were statistically unrelated. We conclude that sensory interhemispheric relay may be picked up with stimulus-synchronized ERPs whereas motor interhemispheric relay effects may be measurable with response-related ERPs in normal humans. However, this proposal ought to be tested with callosotomized subjects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Gene targeting has elucidated a physiological role for PIMT by showing that mice lacking PIMT died prematurely from fatal epileptic seizures. Here we investigated the role of PIMT in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Using surgical specimens of hippocampus and neocortex from controls and epileptic patients, we showed that PIMT activity and expression were 50% lower in epileptic hippocampus than in controls but were unchanged in neocortex. Although the protein was down-regulated, PIMT mRNA expression was unchanged in epileptic hippocampus, suggesting post-translational regulation of the PIMT level. Moreover, several proteins with abnormal aspartyl residues accumulate in epileptic hippocampus. Microtubules component beta-tubulin, one of the major PIMT substrates, had an increased amount (two-fold) of l-isoaspartyl residues in the epileptic hippocampus. These results demonstrate that the down-regulation of PIMT in epileptic hippocampus leads to a significant accumulation of damaged tubulin that could contribute to neuron dysfunction in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

We demonstrate here that recombinant human melanotransferrin (P97) is highly accumulated into the mouse brain following intravenous injection and in situ brain perfusion. Moreover, P97 transcytosis across bovine brain capillary endothelial cell (BBCEC) monolayers is at least 14-fold higher than that of holo-transferrin, with no apparent intra-endothelial degradation. This high transcytosis of P97 was not related to changes in the BBCEC monolayer integrity. In addition, the transendothelial transport of P97 was sensitive to temperature and was both concentration- and conformation-dependent, suggesting that the transport of P97 is due to receptor-mediated endocytosis. In spite of the high degree of sequence identity between P97 and transferrin, a different receptor than the one for transferrin is involved in P97 transendothelial transport. A member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor protein family, likely LRP, seems to be involved in P97 transendothelial transport. The brain accumulation, high rate of P97 transcytosis and its very low level in the blood suggest that P97 could be advantageously employed as a new delivery system to target drugs directly to the brain.

J	Samson, AH; Pollack, GS				Samson, AH; Pollack, GS			Encoding of sound localization cues by an identified auditory interneuron: Effects of stimulus temporal pattern	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CRICKETS TELEOGRYLLUS-OCEANICUS; FLYING CRICKETS; SENSORY HABITUATION; ULTRASOUND; PHONOTAXIS; REPRESENTATION; FREQUENCY; RECEPTORS; BEHAVIOR; NEURON	An important cue for sound localization is binaural comparison of stimulus intensity. Two features of neuronal responses, response strength, i.e., spike count and/or rate, and response latency, vary with stimulus intensity, and binaural comparison of either or both might underlie localization. Previous studies at the receptor-neuron level showed that these response features are affected by the stimulus temporal pattern. When sounds are repeated rapidly, as occurs in many natural sounds, response strength decreases and latency increases, resulting in altered coding of localization cues. In this study we analyze binaural cues for sound localization at the level of an identified pair of interneurons (the left and right AN2) in the cricket auditory system, with emphasis on the effects of stimulus temporal pattern on binaural response differences. AN2 spike count decreases with rapidly repeated stimulation and latency increases. Both effects depend on stimulus intensity. Because of the difference in intensity at the two ears, binaural differences in spike count and latency change as stimulation continues. The binaural difference in spike count decreases, whereas the difference in latency increases. The proportional changes in response strength and in latency are greater at the interneuron level than at the receptor level, suggesting that factors in addition to decrement of receptor responses are involved. Intracellular recordings reveal that a slowly building, long-lasting hyperpolarization is established in AN2. At the same time, the level of depolarization reached during the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) resulting from each sound stimulus decreases. Neither these effects on membrane potential nor the changes in spiking response are accounted for by contralateral inhibition. Based on comparison of our results with earlier behavioral experiments, it is unlikely that crickets use the binaural difference in latency of AN2 responses as the main cue for determining sound direction, leaving the difference in response strength, i.e., spike count and/or rate, as the most likely candidate.

This use is not justified, because significant and extended modification of the cerebral blood flow can occur during a seizure. We validated and compared 2 automatic methods able to determine the optimal reference region, using simulation and clinical data. Methods: In the first method, the selected reference region is the intersection of peri-ictal-interictal areas with no significantly different z values. The other method relies on a 3-dimensional iterative voxel aggregation. The increase of the selected volume is stopped by using 2 different variance tests (Levene and SE). These algorithms were tested on 39 epileptic patients and were validated using 1 interictal and 10 peri-ictal scans simulated from the mean image of 22 healthy subjects. Results: In the patient studies, the mean relative activity of the selected regions, compared with whole-brain activity (classic normalization), was 122.6%. Their average relative size (compared with the size of the whole brain) was 33.2% for the z map method, 22.8% for the SE test, and 11.8% for the Levene test. After application of our automatic processes, subtraction of the simulated images revealed a recovery of abnormal regions up to 45% larger than the region obtained with classic normalization. Conclusion: These results illustrate the role of normalization on the subtracted peri-ictal and interictal images. Our methods are automatic and objective and give good results on various simulated images. The z map construction is worth considering because it is simple, selects large parts of the brain, and requires little computation time.

This activity of SP1 involves its amino-terminal residues that, together with adjacent CA residues, constitute a putative alpha-helical structure spanning Gag residues from positions 359 to 371. In this study, we have determined that the virus assembly determinants within this putative alpha-helix were residues H359, K360, A361, L364, A367, and M368, of which K360 and A367 contribute to virus production to lesser extents. Notably, changes of the two basic amino acids H359 and K360 to arginine (R) impaired virus production, whereas mutations L3641 and M3681, in contrast to L364A and M368A, generated near-wild-type levels of virus particles. This suggests that within Gag complexes, amino acids H359 and K360 are involved in stricter steric interactions than L364 and M368. Since L364 and M368 are separated by four residues and thus presumably located on the same side of the helical surface, they may initiate synergistic hydrophobic interactions to stabilize Gag association. Further analysis in the context of the protease-negative mutation D185H confirmed the key roles of amino acids H359, A361, L364, and M368 in virus assembly. Importantly, when transfected cells were subjected to Dounce homogenization and the cell lysates were treated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 X g, Gag molecules containing each of the H359A, A361V, L364A, and M368A mutations were found mainly in the supernatant fraction (S100), whereas approximately 80% of wild-type Gag proteins were found in the pellet. Therefore, these four mutations must have prevented Gag from generating large complexes.

ACCPN is transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion and is found at a high frequency in the province of Quebec, Canada. ACCPN has been previously mapped to chromosome 15q. The gene SLC12A6 (solute carrier family 12, member 6), which encodes the K(+)-Cl(-) transporter KCC3 and maps within the ACCPN candidate region, was screened for mutations in individuals with ACCPN. Four distinct protein-truncating mutations were found: two in the French Canadian population and two in non-French Canadian families. The functional consequence of the predominant French Canadian mutation (2436delG, Thr813fsX813) was examined by heterologous expression of wildtype and mutant KCC3 in Xenopus laevis oocytes; the truncated mutant is appropriately glycosylated and expressed at the cellular membrane, where it is non-functional. Mice generated with a targeted deletion of Slc12a6 have a locomotor deficit, peripheral neuropathy and a sensorimotor gating deficit, similar to the human disease. Our findings identify mutations in SLC12A6 as the genetic lesion underlying ACCPN and suggest a critical role for SLC12A6 in the development and maintenance of the nervous system.

It has been argued that the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (areas 47/12 and 45) is involved in the active retrieval of information from posterior cortical association areas. Active retrieval is required when stimuli in memory do not bear stable relations to each other and therefore retrieval cannot be automatically driven by strong, stable, and unambiguous stimulus or context relations. Data from functional activation studies with normal human subjects are presented that have demonstrated specific changes in activity within the mid-ventrolateral region of the frontal cortex in relation to the active retrieval of information from memory. By contrast, increases in activity in the mid-dorsolateral region of the frontal cortex occur when the performance of the tasks requires monitoring of information in memory.

Much less is known, however, with regard to the dynamic neural changes that occur in the motor system during the different phases of learning. In this paper, we review recent findings, mainly from our own work using fMRI, which suggest that: (i) the learning of sequential finger movements produces a slowly evolving reorganization within primary motor cortex (M I) over the course of weeks and (ii) this change in M1 follows more dynamic, rapid changes in the cerebellum, striatum, and other motor-related cortical areas over the course of days. We also briefly review neurophysiological and psychophysical evidence for the consolidation of motor skills, and we propose a working hypothesis of its underlying neural substrate in motor sequence learning.

The detection of activated areas was performed by comparing the BOLD signal at each voxel to a model of the expected signal. Since little is known about the BOLD response to IEDs, we modeled it with the response to brief auditory events (G. H. Glover, 1999, NeuroImage 9, 416-429). For each activated area, we then obtained the time course of the BOLD signal for the complete session and computed the actual average hemodynamic response function (HRF) to IEDs. In two of four patients, we observed clear BOLD responses to single IEDs. The average response was composed of a positive lobe peaking between 6 and 7 s in all patients and a negative undershoot in three patients. There were important variations in amplitude and shape between average HRFs across patients. The average HRF presented a wider positive lobe than the Glover model in three patients and a longer undershoot in two. There was a remarkable similarity in the shape of the HRF across areas for patients presenting multiple activation sites. There was no clear correlation between the amplitude of individual BOLD responses and the amplitude of the corresponding EEG spike. The possibility of a longer HRF could be used to improve statistical detection of activation in simultaneous EEG-fMRI. The variability in average HRFs across patients could reflect in part different pathophysiological mechanisms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Deficits in PPI have been reported in schizophrenia and other psychiatric/neurological disorders, and correlate with symptom severity in schizophrenia, suggesting that deficient PPI per se or abnormalities in neural circuits regulating PPI may cause some symptoms of schizophrenia. If so, then genes conferring reduced PPI),nay contribute toward genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia. Studies with selectively bred rodent strains indicate that PPI is under genetic control; however, the identity of the relevant genes is unknown. The current study used recombinant congenic mouse strains derived from C57BL/6J and A/J parents to assess genetic variability in PPI and in ASR and to identify provisional quantitative trait loci (QTLs) modulating these phenotypes. Significant between-strain differences in ASR and in PPI at each of several prepulse intensities (75, 80, 85, 90, 95 dB) were found. Correlations between PPI at the various prepulse intensities were highly significant, suggesting appreciable overlap in genetic regulation of PPI across prepulse intensities. Five QTLs (chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 16) associated with PPI across all prepulse intensities, but not with ASR, were identified. Two additional QTLs (chromosomes 2, 11) associated with both PPI and ASR were found. Fifteen QTLs were associated with ASR alone. Data on genotypes of informative congenic strains were used to support probable involvement of loci modulating PPI and to narrow the probable chromosomal location of QTLs. If confirmed, these QTLs may suggest candidate genes directing novel mechanisms for regulation of PPI. (C) 2002 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

After a 48-h low-protein diet, 17 healthy volunteers received either a tryptophan-free mixture of amino acids or a placebo at 10:30 A.M., in a randomized double-blind cross-over design, resulting in a 77% decrease and 41% decrease of serum tryptophan at 3:30 P.M. and 9:30 P.M., respectively. Urinary sulfatoxy-melatonin excretion and mood were unaffected by the rapid tryptophan depletion (RTD), but rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency increased by 21 min (from 91.5 +/- 4.5 min to 112.2 +/- 6.9 min), sleep fragmentation 58%, and REM density of the first REM sleep period doubled. The results show that midmorning RTD delays REM sleep latency during following night-time sleep, whereas evening RTD shortens REM sleep latency in previous studies, and suggest that the serotonin control of REM sleep latency is upregulated.

However, no reliable predictors Of mood response to ATD have been established. In the present study, individual subject data of six ATD studies were pooled ('mega-analysis') in order to investigate the mdiating role of clinical, demographic and biochemical characteristics in the mood response to ATD. A procedure was developed to make different versions of the Hamilton scale comparable. Recurrent depressive episodes, female gender, prior exposure to SSRI antidepressant treatment and previous serious suicidal thoughts/attempts all appear to be independent predictors Of mood response to ATD. Chronicity of illness is the most powerful predictor. Residual symptoms of depression were not found to predict response to ATD. ATD may be useful to study the mechanism of action of SSRI antidepressants and individual biological vulnerability of the serotonin system. Whether the effects of ATD represent a reversal of the action of SSRI antidepressants or individual vulnerability probably depends upon the timing of the procedure in the course of remission of a depressive episode.

There were four findings: (I) Participants in the negative stressor condition were faster to shift attention away from negative words than positive or neutral words: (2) attentional shifts away from negative words were associated with stress-induced mood lowering; (3) participants in the negative stress condition with elevated scores on the Beck Depression Inventory were slow to disengage attention from all stimuli: and (4) elevated depression scores were associated with lower cortisol change from baseline during the experimental phase. and with higher cortisol levels during the recovery phase. These findings point to information-processing strategies as a means to regulate emotion, and to at atypical features of cognitive and adrenocortical function that may serve as putative risk markers of depression.

Here, we show that a molecular motor protein, myosin Va, is present in high proportions in the cytoskeleton of mouse CNS and peripheral nerves. Immunoelectron microscopy, coimmunoprecipitation, and blot overlay analyses demonstrate that myosin Va in axons associates with neurofilaments, and that the NF-L subunit is its major ligand. A physiological association is indicated by observations that the level of myosin Va is reduced in axons of NF-L-null mice lacking neurofilaments and increased in mice overexpressing NF-L, but unchanged in NF-H-null mice. In vivo pulse-labeled myosin Va advances along axons at slow transport rates overlapping with those of neurofilament proteins and actin, both of which coimmunoprecipitate with myosin Va. Eliminating neurofilaments from mice selectively accelerates myosin Va translocation and redistributes myosin Va to the actin-rich subaxolemma and membranous organelles. Finally, peripheral axons of dilute-lethal mice, lacking functional myosin Va, display selectively increased neurofilament number and levels of neurofilament proteins without altering axon caliber. These results identify myosin Va as a neurofilament-associated protein, and show that this association is essential to establish the normal distribution, axonal transport, and content of myosin Va, and the proper numbers of neurofilaments in axons.

In the present investigation CD-1 mice exposed to a series of different stressors, twice a day over 54 days, exhibited increased signs of depression and anxiety, including increased passivity in a forced swim test, reduced aggression in a social interaction test, and delayed approach to food in a novel environment. Consistent with the view that a chronic stressor regimen affects immune-related processes, sickness behavior elicited by the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1beta, was augmented in response to a chronic but not an acute stressor. Relative to nonstressed mice, median eminence serotonin was augmented by the cytokine treatment administered 24 h after chronic stressor exposure. Treatment with IL-1beta diminished plasma growth hormone levels and increased circulating corticosterone levels irrespective of the animals stressor history. It is suggested that chronic stressor exposure may instigate relatively protracted neurochemical effects, thereby influencing the behavioral responses to later psychological and systemic challenges.

We examined whether the two phorbol ester-activated PKCs in Aplysia, the Ca2+-activated PKC Apl I and the Ca2+-independent PKC Apl 11, are associated with these MTs. Phorbol esters translocated PKC to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, and a significant portion of this translocated pool was sensitive to low concentrations of nocodazole. Low doses of nocodazole had no effect on the amount of PKC in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in the absence of phorbol esters, whereas higher doses of nocodazole reduced basal levels of PKC Apl II. The F-actin cytoskeletal disrupter, latrunculin A, removed both PKCs from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in both control and phorbol ester-treated nervous systems. PKC Apl 11 also directly interacted with purified MTs. In detergent-extracted cells, both PKCs immunolocalized predominantly with MTs. PKCs were associated with newly formed MTs invading the actin-rich peripheral growth cone domain after PKC activation. Our results are consistent with a central role for PKCs in regulating MT extension.

Patients between 3 and 17 years of age with either typical diffuse pontine glioma on MRI or histologically proven anaplastic astrocytoma/glioblastoma multiforme located in the pons, were eligible. Treatment consisted of oral trophosphamide 100 mg m(-2) day(-1) combined with oral etoposide at 25 mg m(-2) day(-1) starting simultaneously with conventional radiation. Twenty patients were enrolled (median age 6 years, male: female=9:11). Surgical procedures included: no surgery: five, open biopsy: three, stereotactic biopsy: six, partial resection: three, and sub-total resection: three. Histological diagnoses included pilocytic astrocytoma: one, astrocytoma with no other specification: three, anaplastic astrocytoma: three, glioblastoma multiforme: eight, no histology: five. The most frequent side effects were haematologic and gastrointestinal. There was no toxic death. The response to combined treatment in 12 evaluable patients was: complete response: 0, partial response: three, stable disease: four, and progressive disease: five. All tumours progressed locally and all patients died. The overall median survival was 8 months. The overall survival rates at I and 4 years were: 0.4 and 0.05 respectively. This was not different from a control group of patients documented in the same population. Oral trophosphamide in combination with etoposide did not improve survival of pontine glioma patients. The treatment was well tolerated and should be evaluated for more chemoresponsive paediatric malignancies. (C) 2002 Cancer Research UK.

We investigated the influence of downregulation of NO synthesis on oscillatory components of ON and OFF evoked field potentials in the rat superior colliculus. NO synthesis was decreased by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) with an acute microinjection of N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The study focuses on rhythmic activity by analyzing fast Fourier transform (FFT). Collicular responses were recorded in anesthetized rats, at postnatal days (PND) 13-19 and adults. This time window was chosen because it is centered on eye opening. NO downregulation resulted in a dual effect depending on age and response-type. NO synthesis inhibition decreased the magnitude of oscillations in ON responses in the youngest animals (PND13-14), whereas oscillations of frequencies higher than 20 Hz in OFF responses were increased in all age groups of developing rats. In adults NO downregulation increased oscillations in ON responses and decreased oscillations in OFF responses. L-Arginine was used to increase NOS activity and its injection produced effects opposite to those seen with L-NAME. Slow oscillatory components (7-12 Hz) were unaffected in all experiments. Our data together with results reported in the literature suggest that rhythmic patterns of activity are NO-dependent. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent studies in a single kindred with a point mutation in the MAO-A gene, together with phenotypic evaluations of MAO-A knockout mice, have sharpened this interest. The goal of this study was to investigate the behavioral consequences of MAO inhibition during brain development and to determine the extent to which specific effects could be attributed to MAO-A versus MAO-B. Methods: MAO-A and B inhibitors were administered, separately or in combination, during gestation and lactation. Behavioral evaluations included neurologic testing, delay of rewarded response, and the resident-intruder aggression paradigm, conducted before and after an acute pharmacologic challenge. Results: Total prenatal MAO inhibition produced a pervasive increase in aggressive behavior, whereas MAO-B inhibited mice demonstrated a similar pattern of lower intensity. Aggression was elevated in MAO-A inhibited mice only after acute pharmacologic challenge, suggesting prenatal sensitization. Conclusions: Developmental inhibition of MAO activity engenders behavioral effects that parallel those observed in animals with genetic ablation of MAO function. These data underscore the importance of neurochemical changes during development and provide a possible model for disinhibited aggression, common in clinical populations.

However, the emergence and characteristics of such HA variants in the clinical setting remain poorly studied. Herein, we report 2 influenza A(H3N2) isolates, from untreated patients, harboring an Arg229-->Ile substitution in the HA1 gene. The Ile229 variants were as sensitive as the Arg229 viruses to zanamivir and oseltamivir in neuroaminidase inhibition assays but were significantly less susceptible (by 60-140-fold) in cell-based assays. Although the Ile229 variants adsorbed less efficiently to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in kinetic binding assays, they remained very sensitive to zanamivir in ferrets. Our study shows the importance of the HA1 229 residue in virus binding to MDCK cells and confirms the unreliability of cell-based assays in predicting the in vivo susceptibility of HA variants to NAIs.

It has been proposed that METH-induced redistribution of DA from the vesicular storage pool to the cytoplasm, where DA can oxidize to produce quinones and additional reactive oxygen species, may account for this selective neurotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, we used mice heterozygous (+/-) or homozygous (-/-) for the brain vesicular monoamine uptake transporter VMAT2, which mediates the accumulation of cytosolic DA into synaptic vesicles. In postnatal ventral midbrain neuronal cultures derived from these mice, METH-induced degeneration of DA neurites and accumulation of oxyradicals, including metabolites of oxidized DA, varied inversely with VMAT2 expression. METH administration also promoted the synthesis of DA via upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, resulting in an elevation of cytosolic DA even in the absence of vesicular sequestration. Electron microscopy and fluorescent labeling confirmed that METH promoted the formation of autophagic granules, particularly in neuronal varicosities and, ultimately, within cell bodies of dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, we propose that METH neurotoxicity results from the induction of a specific cellular pathway that is activated when DA cannot be effectively sequestered in synaptic vesicles, thereby producing oxyradical stress, autophagy, and neurite degeneration.

The potential significance of Kir2 subunit heterotetramerization has been controversial, but recent findings suggest that heteromultimerization of Kir2.1-3 may be significant. This study was designed to investigate whether the recently described Kir2.4 subunit can form heterotetramers with the important subunit Kir2.1, and if so, to investigate whether the resulting heterotetrameric channels are functional. Co-expression of either dominant negative Kir2.1 or Kir2.4 subunits in Xenopus oocytes with either wild-type Kir2.1 or 2.4 strongly decreased resulting current amplitude. To examine physical association between Kir2.1 and Kir2.4, Cos-7 cells were co-transfected with a His(6)-tagged Kir2.1 subunit (Kir2.1-His(6)) and a FLAG-tagged Kir2.4 subunit (Kir2.4-FLAG). After pulldown with a His(6)-binding resin, Kir2.4-FLAG could be detected in the eluted cell lysate by Western blotting, indicating co-assembly of Kir2.1-His(6) and Kir2.4-FLAG. Expression of a tandem construct containing covalently linked Kir2.1 and 2.4 subunits led to robust current expression. Kir2.1-Kir2.4 tandem subunit expression, as well as co-injection of Kir2.1 and Kir2.4 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes, produced currents with barium sensitivity greater than that of Kir2.1 or Kir2.4 subunit expression alone. These results show that Kir2.4 subunits can co-assemble with Kir2.1 subunits, and that co-assembled channels are functional, with properties different from those of Kir2.4 or Kir2.1 alone. Since Kir2.1 and Kir2.4 mRNAs have been shown to co-localize in the CNS, Kir2.1 and Kir2.4 heteromultimers might play a role in the heterogeneity of native inward rectifier currents.

DNA from 213 schizophrenic patients and 241 normal individuals from Canada were genotyped with this marker set. Two 1,400- and 65-kb regions contained markers associated with the disease. Two markers from the 65-kb region were also found to be associated to schizophrenia in a Russian sample. Two overlapping genes G72 and G30 transcribed in brain were experimentally annotated in this 65-kb region. Transfection experiments point to the existence of a 153-aa protein coded by the G72 gene. This protein is rapidly evolving in primates, is localized to endoplasmic reticulum/ Golgi in transfected cells, is able to form multimers and specifically binds to carbohydrates. Yeast two-hybrid experiments with the G72 protein identified the enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) as an interacting partner. DAAO is expressed in human brain where it oxidizes D-serine, a potent activator of N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor. The interaction between G72 and DAAO was confirmed in vitro and resulted in activation of DAAO. Four SNIP markers from DAAO were found to be associated with schizophrenia in the Canadian samples. Logistic regression revealed genetic interaction between associated SNPs in vicinity of two genes. The association of both DAAO and a new gene G72 from 13q34 with schizophrenia together with activation of DAAO activity by a G72 protein product points to the involvement of this N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor regulation pathway in schizophrenia.

B., and Zannis-Hadjopoulos, M. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 14317-14325). Here, wild-type and single- and double-knockout nuclear extracts from the 14-3-3 Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologues Bmh1p and Bmh2p were analyzed for similar cruciform-binding activities in relation to these proteins. The Bmh1p-Bmh2p heterodimer, present in the wild-type strain, bound efficiently to cruciform-containing DNA in a structure-specific manner because cruciform DNA efficiently competed with the formation of the complex, whereas linear DNA did not. In contrast, the band-shift ability of the Bmh1p-Bmh1p and Bmh2p-Bmh2p homodimers present in the bmh2(-) and bmh1(-) single-knockout cells, respectively, was reduced by similar to93 and 82%, respectively. The 14-3-3 plant homologue GF14 was also able to bind to cruciform DNA, suggesting that cruciform-binding activity is a common feature of the family of 14-3-3 proteins across species. Bmh1p and Bmh2p were found to associate in vivo with the yeast autonomous replication sequence ARS307, as assayed by formaldehyde cross-linking, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Bmh1p/Bmh2p antibody and conventional PCR. In agreement with the finding of an association of Bmh1p and Bmh2p with ARS307, another immunoprecipitation experiment using 2D3, an anti-cruciform DNA monoclonal antibody, revealed the presence of cruciform-containing DNA in ARS307.

Objective To compare regional brain volumes at initial scan and their change over time in medicated and previously unmedicated male and female patients with ADHD and healthy controls. Design, Setting, and Participants Case-control study conducted from 19912001 at the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Md, of 152 children and adolescents with ADHD (age range, 5-18 years) and 139 age- and sex-matched controls (age range, 4.5-19 years) recruited from the local community, who contributed 544 anatomic magnetic resonance images. Main Outcome Measures Using completely automated methods, initial volumes and prospective age-related changes of total cerebrum, cerebellum, gray and white matter for the 4 major lobes, and caudate nucleus of the brain were compared in patients and controls. Results On initial scan, patients with ADHD had significantly smaller brain volumes in all regions, even after adjustment for significant covariates. This global difference was reflected in smaller total cerebral volumes (-3.2%, adjusted F-1,F-280=8.30, P=.004) and in significantly smaller cerebellar volumes (-3.5%, adjusted F-1,F-280=12.29, P=.001). Compared with controls, previously unmedicated children with ADHD demonstrated significantly smaller total cerebral volumes (overall F-2,F-288=6.65; all pairwise comparisons Bonferroni corrected, -5.8%; P=.002) and cerebellar volumes (-6.2%, F-2,F-288=8.97, P<.001). Unmedicated children with ADHD also exhibited strikingly smaller total white matter volumes (F-2,F-288= 11.65) compared with controls (-10.7%, P<.001) and with medicated children with ADHD (-8.9%, P<.001). Volumetric abnormalities persisted with age in total and regional cerebral measures (P=.002) and in the cerebellum (P=.003). Caudate nucleus volumes were initially abnormal for patients with ADHD (P=.05), but diagnostic differences disappeared as caudate volumes decreased for patients and controls during adolescence. Results were comparable for male and female patients on all measures. Frontal and temporal gray matter, caudate, and cerebellar volumes correlated significantly with parent- and clinician-rated severity measures within the ADHD sample (Pearson coefficients between -0.16 and -0.26; all P values were <.05). Conclusions Developmental trajectories for all structures, except caudate, remain roughly parallel for patients and controls during childhood and adolescence, suggesting that genetic and/or early environmental influences on brain development in ADHD are fixed, nonprogressive, and unrelated to stimulant treatment.

In the nervous system of the marine mollusk Aplysia, there are only two major PKC isoforms, the calcium-activated PKC Apl I and the calcium-independent PKC Apl II, and both PKCs are persistently activated during intermediate memory. We monitored the PDK-dependent phosphorylation of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II using phosphopeptide antibodies. During persistent activation of PKCs in Aplysia neurons, there is a significant increase in the amount of PDK-phosphorylated PKC Apl II in the particulate fraction but no increase in the amount of PKC Apl I phosphorylated by PDK. PDK phosphorylation of PKCs was not sensitive to inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PKC, or expression of a kinase-inactive PDK. Localization of PDK-phosphorylated PKC Apl II using immunocytochemistry revealed an enrichment of phosphorylated PKC Apl II at the plasma membrane. These data suggest that increased PDK phosphorylation of PKC Apl II is important for persistent kinase activation.

DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) is a receptor for netrin-1 implicated in mediating these responses. Here, we show that DCC interacts constitutively with the SH3/SH2 adaptor Nck in commissural neurons. This interaction is direct and requires the SH3 but not SH2 domains of Nck-1. Moreover, both DCC and Nck-1 associate with the actin cytoskeleton, and this association is mediated by DCC. A dominant negative Nck-1 inhibits the ability of DCC to induce neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells and to activate Rac1 in fibroblasts in response to netrin-1. These studies provide evidence for an important role of mammalian Nck-1 in a novel signaling pathway from an extracellular guidance cue to changes in the actin-based cytoskeleton responsible for axonal guidance.

J	Lassonde, M				Lassonde, M			Clinical neuropsychology in Quebec and Canada.	A N A E-APPROCHE NEUROPSYCHOLOGIQUE DES APPRENTISSAGES CHEZ L ENFANT			French	Article						evaluation of higher cognitive functions, reserved act; Canadian Psychological Association; Quebec Order of Psychologists		Clinical neuropsychology has initially developed in a parallel fashion in Quebec and the rest of Canada. Quebec's neuropsychology was influenced by both the medical European tradition and the anglo-saxon experimental approach, best exemplified by the work carried out by Brenda Milner at the Montreal Neurological Institute. In the 60's and 70's, the rest of Canada was rather influenced by the American approach, which consisted in administering batteries of standardized neuropsychological tests. In the early 80's, a Canadian consortium elaborated specific criteria for doctoral training in clinical neuropsychology. The accreditation committee of the Canadian Psychological Association evaluates the conformity of the Canadian programs in clinical neuropsychology with these specific criteria. Hence, clinical neuropsychology is now exercised throughout Canada by psychologists who have deceived a specialized doctoral training in clinical neuropsychology. Although some specialists from other professions (speech pathologists, occupational therapists, medical doctors, etc.) sometimes evaluate higher cognitive functions, a judgment from the Superior Court of Quebec recognizes the legal validity of these examinations only when they have been performed by neuropsychologists or psychiatrists. Finally, a recent decision from the Quebec Order of Professions states that the neuropsychological evaluation is a "reserved" act that can only be performed by psychologists who have a doctoral training in neuropsychology.

Animals were trained to discriminate a dose of acetaldehyde (0.2 or 0.3 g/kg, i.p.) from saline in eight consecutive cycles consisting of a pairing day (PD) and three nonpairing days (NPDs). On PDs, all animals were injected with a particular dose of acetaldehyde 30 min before a 20-min limited access to a saccharin solution [0.1% (wt./vol.)] and then injected immediately with either LiCl (0.15 M, 1.8 mEq) or saline. On the three following NPDs, animals were injected with saline and 30 min later were presented with the same saccharin solution for 20 min. All animals in each acetaldehyde training dose group acquired discriminative stimulus control before generalization tests were conducted. Results of generalization tests (ethanol doses of 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 g/kg) revealed that ethanol substituted for acetaldehyde at doses of 1.2 and 1.6 g/kg for both training doses of acetaldehyde. The findings for this study indicate that acetaldehyde and ethanol may share some stimulus properties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Little information exists regarding the EFA status of vulnerable populations living in Southern regions. Objective: We examined the adequacy of EFA status in Cuban breast-feeding mothers and their infants. Design: Blood and breast-milk, samples were obtained from a cross-sectional sample of mothers and term infants in Havana at 2 mo postpartum. We determined the fatty acid profiles of total lipids in breast milk, plasma, and erythrocytes and assessed infant visual acuity by using Teller acuity cards. Results: Of the 56 mothers and infants examined, none showed biochemical signs of poor EFA status. Compared with values reported in the literature, mothers had an adequate EFA profile in their breast milk, plasma, and erythrocytes. The docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentration in breast milk was 0.43 +/- 0.26% of total fatty acids. It appeared that these breast-fed infants had an adequate dietary supply of DHA, as reflected by the mean plasma and erythrocyte DHA concentrations (2.82 +/- 0.84% and 7.41 +/- 1.16% of total fatty acids, respectively). Infant visual acuity testing showed a mean of 2.00 +/- 0.68 cycles/degree, which is within the normal range of mean binocular acuities for 2-mo-old term infants. The data did not show any relation between EFA concentrations and visual acuity. Conclusion: The results suggest that n-3 fatty acid deficiency and potential related deficits in early visual neural development are rare, if they exist at all, in breast-feeding women and their infants in Havana.

After the induction of anesthesia, 12 patients were orotracheally intubated. Two Ag/AgCl-electrodes were attached at the right seventh or eighth intercostal space between the midclavicular and anterior axillary line; two Ag/AgCl- electrodes were paravertebrally attached on the right side lateral to vertebrae T12-L1 or L1-2. Two Ag/AgCl-skin-electrodes were placed over the right thenar area for an electromyography recording of the adductor pollicis (AP) muscle, and two Ag/AgCl-skin-electrodes were used to stimulate the ulnar nerve. Onset and offset of neuromuscular blockade after rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg were determined, and significant differences between diaphragm and AP muscle and agreement between the two methods were determined. Mean maximum block was more than 96% at all sites. Lag time, onset 50, and onset time were not significantly different between the diaphragm and the AP. However, time to reach 25% of control twitch was significantly longer at the AP muscle than at the diaphragm (P < 0.001). The difference of the means and limits of agreement between the anterior and the posterior site of diaphragmatic monitoring were 0 +/- 11 s, 3 +/- 9 s, 0 +/- 19 s, and - 2% +/- 5% for lag, onset 50, onset time, and peak effect, respectively, and -2 +/- 2 min for the time to reach 25% of control twitch of neuromuscular blockade. We conclude that anterior and posterior diaphragmatic monitoring can be used interchangeably to determine neuromuscular blockade after rocuronium.

Cerebral axonal damage can be specifically assessed in vivo by measuring levels of brain N-acetylaspartate (NAA, a specific index of axonal integrity detected by MR spectroscopy). Other new MR measurements such as magnetization transfer ratio (MTr) or computed estimation of brain volume can provide less specific indexes of tissue damage. Objective: To determine whether diffuse axonal and tissue injury is present in patients with definite MS who do not show clinically significant disability. Methods: We measured brain NAA levels (normalized to creatine [Cr]), MTr values, and cerebral volumes in patients with definite MS who had low T2-weighted MR imaging lesion volumes and no clinical disability, and also in age-matched healthy control subjects. Results: Values of central brain NAA/Cr and MTr in normal-appearing white matter were significantly lower in the MS patients than in controls (P<.001). In contrast, total brain volumes were not significantly different between these groups. Similar results were found for MS patients with early disease (duration, <3 years) and with a particularly low cerebral T2-weighted MR imaging lesion load (less than or equal to2 cm(3)). Conclusions: Cerebral NAA/Cr and MTr values are diffusely decreased in MS patients with early disease, low demyelinating lesion load, and no significant disability. This suggests that axonal and/or tissue injury begins very early in the course of MS and might be at least partially independent of cerebral demyelination.

J	O'Connor, K				O'Connor, K			A cognitive-behavioral/psychophysiologicaI model of tic disorders	BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH AND THERAPY			English	Review							LA-TOURETTE-SYNDROME; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; HABIT-REVERSAL; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; PREMONITORY URGES; STARTLE REFLEX; PIMOZIDE; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION	This article discusses current cognitive behavioral, as well as neurophysiological, accounts of the development and maintenance of tic behavior in chronic (simple or complex) tic disorders. A cognitive psychophysiological model is further elaborated, highlighting the reciprocal interplay of background cognitive and physiological factors preceding tic onset. According to the model, cognitive factors such as perfectionist concerns and heightened sensory awareness and self-attention, as well as physiological factors such as a high level of motor activation and accompanying elevated muscle tension, play a role in tic habits. Negative appraisals of tics and counter-productive coping strategies developed by clients as a means to suppress or to disguise the tic behavior may also locally reinforce tic onset. Neurochemical factors are viewed largely as concomitants of behavioral adaptations or compensations to the tic problem rather than as independent markers or precursors of tic onset. Clinically, the model emphasizes the role of cognitive-behavioral factors in tic onset, and suggests that tic management is best accomplished through cognitive behavioral interventions designed to prevent build up of both tension and pre-monitory urge in tic-affected muscles, rather than reverse the tic at the onset of the premonitory urge. The clinical validity of parts of the model is supported by recent experimental, psychometric and clinical studies. Other parts of the model remain speculative but at least yield testable predictions. A strength of the model is its ability to account for findings over diverse psychological and biological domains.

NRDc differs from most of the other members of the M16 family of metalloendopeptidases by a 90 amino acid acidic domain (DAC) inserted close to its active site. At the cell surface, NRDc binds heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and enhances HB-EGF-induced cell migration. An active-site mutant of NRDc fulfills this function as well as wild-type NRDc, indicating that the enzyme activity is not required for this process. We now demonstrate that NRDc starts at Met(49). Furthermore, we show that HB-EGF not only binds to NRDc but also potently inhibits its enzymic activity. NRDc-HB-EGF interaction involves the 21 amino acid heparin-binding domain (P21) of the growth factor, the DAC of NRDc and most probably its active site. Only disulphide-bonded P21 dimers are inhibitory. We also show that Ca2+, via the DAC, regulates both NRDc activity and HB-EGF binding. We conclude that the DAC is thus a key regulatory element for the two distinct functions that NRDc fulfills, i.e. as an HB-EGF modulator and a peptidase.

We examined the effect of damage to frontal and striatal brain regions in man on the susceptibility to backward masking in rapid stimulus streams. Patients with unilateral frontal excisions and patients with early Huntington's disease were compared to controls in the identification of a brief white letter embedded in short streams of black letters at two presentation rates: (a) 9 letters/s; (b) 12.5 letters/s and also in a control condition in which the first post-target masking letter was absent. Patients could identify the target when the post-target mask was absent, but reducing the delay between stimuli significantly increased the error rates in patients. Intrusion errors often involved reporting post-target or pre-target distractors instead of the target. These results suggest that fronto-striatal lesions increase the period during which perceptual decisions are susceptible to perturbation. This deficit is compatible with a functional role of frontal systems in the cognitive control of brief perceptual decisions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

We utilized an antibody that selectively recognizes the neo epitope generated by caspase-3 mediated cleavage of APP (alphaDeltaC(csp)-APP) to determine if this proteolytic event occurs in senile plaques in the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus of autopsied AD and age-matched control brains. Consistent with a role for caspase-3 activation in AD pathology, alphaDeltaC(csp)-APP immunoreactivity colocalized with a subset of TUNEL-positive pyramidal neurons in AD brains. alphaDeltaC(csp)-APP immunoreactivity was found in neurons and glial cells, as well as in small and medium-size particulate elements, resembling dystrophic terminals and condensed nuclei, respectively, in AD and age-matched control brains. There were a larger number of alphaDeltaC(csp)-APP immunoreactive elements in the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus of subjects with AD pathology than age-matched controls. alphaAC(csp)-APP immunoreactivity in small and medium size particulate elements were the main component colocalized with 30% of senile plaques in the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus of AD brains. In some control brains, alphaAC(csp)-APP immunoreactivity appeared to be associated with a clinical history of metabolic encephalopathy. Our results suggest that apoptosis contributes to cell death resulting from amyloidosis and plaque deposition in AD.

Lesions of the dorsolateral funiculi at the low thoracic level (T,3) that completely interrupted both the cortico- and rubrospinal pathways produced long-term deficits in locomotion on a level surface. These deficits included a paw-drag that was probably caused both by a loss of cortico- and rubrospinal input to motoneurones controlling distal muscles as well as by a change in the relative timing of muscles acting around the hip and knee. Smaller lesions produced similar deficits from which the cats recovered relatively quickly. Cats with the largest lesions of the dorsolateral funiculi were unable to modify their gait sufficiently to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill belt even 3-5 months postlesion. These results imply that the medial pathways, the reticulo- and vestibulospinal pathways, are unable to fully compensate for damage to the lateral pathways. Single unit recordings from identified pyramidal tract neurones (PTNs) within the hindlimb representation of the primary motor cortex (area 4) showed that a substantial proportion of neurones (67%) significantly increased their discharge frequency when the cats modified their gait to step over obstacles attached to the treadmill belt. Of those PTNs that showed increased activity during the swing phase, populations of neurones were activated at different times. A large proportion of PTNS discharged early in swing, in phase with knee flexors such as the semitendinosus. Others discharged slightly later, in phase with the activity of ankle flexors, such as tibialis anterior, while still others discharged at the end of swing, in phase with digit dorsiflexors, such as the extensor digitorum brevis. We suggest that different populations of cortical neurones may specifically modify the activity of selected groups of close synergistic muscles during different parts of the swing phase. We further suggest that these modifications are mediated, in part, by groups of interneurones that are involved in determining the base locomotor rhythm. This provides a means by which the changes specified by the descending signal from the motor cortex may be smoothly, and appropriately, incorporated into the locomotor cycle.

This suggests that there is, within the spinal cord, an autonomous network of neurons capable of generating a locomotor pattern independently of supraspinal inputs. Recent studies suggest that several physiological and neurochemical changes have to occur in the neuronal networks located caudally to the lesion to allow the expression of spinal locomotion. Some evidence of this plasticity will be addressed in this review. In addition, original data on the functional organisation of the lumbar spinal cord will also be presented. Recent works in our lab show that segmental responsiveness of the spinal cord of the cat to locally micro-injected drugs in different lumbar segments, in combination with complete lesions at various level of the spinal cord, suggest a rostro-caudal organisation of spinal locomotor control. Moreover, the integrity of midlumbar segments seems to be crucial for the expression of spinal locomotion. These data suggest that the regions of critical importance for locomotion can be confined to a restricted portion of the spinal cord. Later, these midlumbar segments could be targeted by electrical stimulation or grafts to improve recovery of function. Understanding the changes in spinal cord neurophysiology and neurochemistry after a lesion is of critical importance to the improvement of treatments for locomotor rehabilitation in spinal-cord-injured patients.

Thus, it is necessary to continue to develop new treatment and rehabilitation strategies and understand the factors that can enhance recovery of walking following spinal cord injury (SCI). One new development is the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) device to assist locomotion. The objective of this review is to present findings from some recent studies on the effect of long-term locomotor training with FES in subjects with SCI. Promising results are shown in all outcome measures of walking, such as functional mobility, speed, spatio-temporal parameters, and the physiological cost of walking. Furthermore, the change in the walking behavior could be associated with plasticity in the CNS organization, as seen by the modification of the stretch reflex and changes in the corticospinal projection to muscles of the lower leg. In conclusion, recovery of walking is an increasing possibility for a large number of people with SCI. New modalities of treatment have become available for this population but most still need to be evaluated for their efficacy. This review has focused on FES assisted walking as a therapeutic modality in subjects with chronic SCI, but it is envisaged that the care and recovery of SCI in the early phase of recovery could also be improved.

These cells, representing less than 1% of total islet cells, are of a small size (7-10 mum) and highly quiescent. They display a fairly immature morphology, which is characterized by a weakly developed protein synthesis machinery, a few mitochondria and a small number of neuroendocrine granules. These cells, which we have termed "small cells," are usually organized into small clusters, which can be identified within the islets of predominantly small size. They can also be collected as separate structures from preparations of freshly isolated islets. Immunohistochemically, small cells are positive for PDX-1, synaptophysin, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, alpha-fetaprotein and Bcl-2 and negative for cytokeratin 19 and nestin. Insulin secretion studies demonstrated that these cells secrete insulin in a glucose-responsive fashion, although do not respond to secretagogues such as IBMX and arginine as do mature beta cells. Although this study does not provide evidence of the proliferative and differentiation potential of small cells, their immature morphology, along with a small size and quiescence, let us hypothesize that these cells may serve as progenitors contributing to the islet growth.

Western blots of sea pansy extracts revealed a protein band that co-migrated with dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) from mouse adrenal glands. Similar experiments with antisera against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) revealed several immunoreactive protein bands, all of larger molecular weight than mammalian tyrosine hydroxylase. DBH-like and, to a lesser extent, TH-like and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase-like immunoreactivities were detected in ectodermal sensory neurons and associated subectodermal neurites, in neurons of the mesogleal nerve-net and associated amoebocytes, and in some endodermal neurons. While it is still not clear whether the detected TH-immunoreactive proteins represent some form of TH, the presence in sea pansies of a DBH-like protein is in agreement with previously detected norepinephrine-like immunoreactivity in the same species. The widespread distribution of these immunoreactivities in various sea pansy neurons suggests important roles for catecholamines in nerve net activity.

In this approach, the gradient descent learning procedure is considered as a feedback control system that consists of a controlled process, a feedback mechanism, and a feedback controller. Therefore, the fuzzy control technique can be implemented in order to achieve fast and stable convergence in the learning procedure. Then, the convergent feature of the learning algorithm is investigated. After that, the proposed algorithm is employed to train neural networks for system modeling. A comparison of the proposed algorithm with the other learning approaches, e.g. GD and PIDGD methods, is finally illustrated. An example of system modeling for a temperature process is finally demonstrated.

Ubiquitination is mediated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBCs or E2s), and ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s). Since we previously showed that the activated ubiquitination is UBC4 dependent, we characterized Rat100, a UBC4-dependent E3 expressed in the testis. Analysis of expressed sequence tag sequences and immunoblotting showed that Rat100 is actually a 300-kDa protein expressed mainly in the brain and testis and is similar to the human E3 identified by differential display (EDD) protein and the Drosophila hyperplastic discs gene, mutants of which cause a defect in spermatogenesis. Rat100 is induced during postnatal development of the rat testis, peaking at d 25. It is localized only in germ cells and is highly expressed in spermatocytes, moderately in round and slightly in elongating spermatids. In contrast to UBC4 whose removal from a testis extract abrogates much of the conjugation activity, immmunodepletion of Rat100 from the extracts had little effect. Rat100 therefore has a limited subset of substrates, some of which appear associated with the E3 as the immunoprecipitate containing Rat100 supported incorporation of 125 I-ubiquitin into high molecular weight proteins. Thus, Rat100 is the homolog of human EDD and likely of Drosophila hyperplastic discs. This homology, together with our results, suggests that induction of this E3 results in ubiquitination of specific substrates, some of which are important in male germ cell development.

In previous studies, it has been shown that mechanical perturbation delivered to one moving speech articulator, such as the lower lip or jaw, results in compensatory responses in the perturbed and other non-perturbed articulators, but not in articulators that are uninvolved in the specific speech sound being produced. These observations suggest that the speech motor control system may be organized in a task-specific manner. However, previous studies have not used the appropriate controls to address the mechanism by which this task-specific organization is achieved. A lack of response in a non-perturbed articulator may simply reflect the fact that the muscles examined were not active. Alternatively, there may be a specific gating of somatic sensory signals due to task requirements. The present study was designed to address the nature of the underlying sensorimotor organization. Unanticipated mechanical loads were applied to the upper lip during the "p" in "apa" and "f" in "afa" in six subjects. Both lips are used to produce "p", while only the lower lip is used for "f". For "apa", both upper lip and lower lip responses were observed following upper lip perturbation. For "afa", no upper lip or lower lip responses were observed following the upper lip perturbation. The differential response of the lower lip, which was phasically active during both speech tasks, indicates that the neural organization of these two speech tasks differs not only in terms of the different muscles used to produce the different movements, but also in terms of the sensorimotor interactions within and across the two lips.

Young (3 month old) and older (12-20 months) NFH-LacZ transgenic mice were compared to normal controls for regional brain metabolism, as assessed by cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity. Irrespective of age, CO activity was reduced in three cerebellar-related regions of NFH-LacZ transgenic mice: (1) the lateral reticular nucleus, (2) the parvicellular red nucleus, and (3) the superior colliculus, possibly as a secondary consequence of cerebellar Purkinje cell histopathology. Aged NFH-LacZ mice had lower CO activity relative to either age-matched controls or young transgenic mice in the following regions: the motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, the trapezoid nucleus, the subiculum, the motor cortex, the superior olive, and the lateral dorsal thalamus. These results indicate regional and age-selective deficits of brain metabolism in a transgenic model with neurofilament maldistribution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

We also describe a negative-binomial gamma mixture model to determine intrafamilial correlations of discrete (e.g., count) data. We demonstrate the utility of these methods by analyzing intrafamilial correlations among patients with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), an autosomal-dominant disease caused by mutations of the NF2 tumor-suppressor gene. We estimated intrafamilial correlations in age at first symptom of NF2, age at onset of hearing loss, and number of intracranial meningiomas in 390 NF2 nonprobands from 153 unrelated families. A significant intrafamilial correlation was observed for each of the three features: age at onset (0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.47), age at onset of hearing loss (0.51; 95% Cl, 0.35-0.64), and number of meninginomas (0.29; 95% Cl, 0.15-0.43). Significant correlations were also observed for age at first symptom within NF2 families with truncating mutations (0.41; 95% CI, 0.06-0.68) or splice-site mutations (0.29; 95% CI, 0.03-0.51), for age at onset of hearing loss within families with missense mutations (0.67; 95% CI, 0.18-0.89), and for number of meningiomas within families with splice-site mutations (0.39; 95% CI, 0.13-0.66). Our findings are consistent with effects of both allelic and nonallelic familial factors on the clinical variability of NF2. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Zijdenbos, AP; Forghani, R; Evans, AC				Zijdenbos, AP; Forghani, R; Evans, AC			Automatic "pipeline" analysis of 3-D MRI data for clinical trials: Application to multiple sclerosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						clinical trials; image segmentation; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); multiple sclerosis (MS); tissue quantification	INTENSITY NONUNIFORMITY; HUMAN BRAIN; TISSUE CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES; SEGMENTATION; LESIONS; MODEL; ACTIVATION; SPACE; REGISTRATION	The quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has become increasingly important in both research and clinical studies aiming at human brain development, function, and pathology. Inevitably, the role of quantitative image analysis in the evaluation of drug therapy will increase, driven in part by requirements imposed by regulatory agencies. However, the prohibitive length of time involved and the significant intra- and inter-rater variability of the measurements obtained from manual analysis of large MRI databases represent major obstacles to the wider application of quantitative MRI analysis. We have developed a fully automatic "pipeline" image analysis framework and have successfully applied it to a number of large-scale, multi-center studies (more than 1000 MRI scans). This pipeline system is based on robust image processing algorithms, executed in a parallel, distributed fashion. This paper describes the application of this system to the automatic quantification of multiple sclerosis lesion load in MRI, in the context of a phase III clinical trial. The pipeline results were evaluated through an extensive validation study, revealing that the obtained lesion measurements are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by trained human observers. Given that intra- and inter-rater measurement variability is eliminated by automatic analysis, this system enhances the ability to detect small treatment effects not readily detectable through conventional analysis techniques. While useful for clinical trial analysis in multiple sclerosis, this system holds widespread potential for applications in other neurological disorders, as well as for the study of neurobiology in general.

This removable shielding system, known as the "NeuroShield," consists of a U-shaped lead plate attached to the removable headrest with a plastic coupling piece. The NEC was calculated from information obtained in the "head curves" collected during three different types of study: 1) from subjects undergoing 60-min 250-MBq C-11-Raclopride studies in different bed positions with the NeuroShield in place; 2) from subjects undergoing bolus O-15-water activation studies, with injected activities ranging from 170 to 750 MBq.; and 3) from subjects undergoing glucose utilization studies first without, then with the NeuroShield in place. During the Raclopride studies, the NeuroShield was slightly more effective when placed forward of the field of view (FOV). NEC improvements of up to 24% in the early frames were obtained with the NeuroShield in place. The NEC values during bolus water studies improved by up to 45% with additional shielding. The percentage of random counts diminished during the fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) studies from 17% to 12%/100 MBq of injected activity and the NEC value improved by 5% for a 100-MBq dose.

To test whether platelet-activating factor (PAF) directly causes retinovascular endothelial cell (EC) death. METHODS. Retinovascular density was calculated in rat pups exposed to 80% O-2 from postnatal days (P)6 to P14 (to produce oxygen-induced retinopathy [OIR]), using the adenosine diphosphatase (ADPase) technique, in animals treated with distinct PAF receptor blockers (PCA-4248, BN52021, or THG315). PAF levels were then measured in the retinas. Viability of ECs from piglets and humans in response to C-PAF (a stable PAF analogue) was determined by the reduction of the tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) by viable cells, incorporation of propidium iodide (PI), TUNEL assay, and release of lactate dehydrogenase. Release of thromboxane (TX) was measured in the cell media. RESULTS. PAF levels in retina were markedly increased. by exposure of isolated rat retinas to H2O2 (1 muM) and of rat pups placed in 80% O-2. Exposure to 80% O-2 induced retinal vasoobliteration, which was equally significantly inhibited (similar to60%) by all PAF receptor blockers tested. C-PAF increased incorporation of PI by isolated rat retinal microvasculature. Also, C-PAF caused time- and concentration-dependent death of cultured retinal ECs, which was prevented by the PAF receptor antagonist CV-3988. This effect of C-PAF was selective on retinal and neurovascular ECs, but not on other ECs. DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) was hardly detected, and inhibition of apoptosis-related processes by nicotinamide, cyclosporin A, and Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-VAD-FMK (caspase inhibitors) barely protected against death in EC, whereas C-PAF increased release of lactate dehydrogenase, implying that necrosis is the nature of EC death. Finally, C-PAF-induced cell death was preceded by an increase in TXB2 levels and was prevented by TXA(2) synthase inhibition (with CGS12970). CONCLUSIONS. The data suggest PAF plays a major role in vasoobliteration in OIR by triggering death of neuroretinal microvascular ECs. The cell death seems to be mediated at least in part by TXA(2). These effects of PAF may participate in ischemic retinopathies such as diabetes and retinopathy of prematurity.

J	Grosbras, MH; Paus, T				Grosbras, MH; Paus, T			Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human frontal eye field: Effects on visual perception and attention	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRIES; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL STIMULATION; UNILATERAL NEGLECT; PARIETAL CORTEX; MOVEMENTS	When looking at one object, human subjects can shift their attention to another object in their visual field without moving the eyes. Such shifts of attention activate the same brain regions as those involved in the execution of eye movements. Here we investigate the role of one of the main cortical oculomotor area, namely, the frontal eye field (FEF), in shifts of attention. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a technique known to disrupt transiently eye-movements preparation. We hypothesized that if the FEF is a necessary element in the network involved in shifting attention without moving the eyes, then TMS should also disrupt visuospatial attention. For each volunteer, we positioned the TMS coil over the probabilistic anatomical location of the FEF, and we verified that single pulses delayed eye movements. We then applied TMS during a visuospatial attention task. In this task, a central arrow directed shifts of attention and the subject responded by a keypress to a subsequent visual peripheral target without moving the eyes from the central fixation point. In a few trials, the cue was invalid or uninformative, yielding slower responses than when the cue was valid. We delivered single pulses either 53 msec before or 70 msec after target onset. Contrary to our prediction, the main effect of the stimulation was a decrease in reaction time when it was applied 53 msec before target onset. TMS over the left hemisphere facilitated responses to targets in the right hemifield only and for all cueing conditions, whereas TMS over the right hemisphere had a bilateral effect for valid and neutral but not invalid cueing. Thus, TMS interfered with shift of attention only in the case of right hemisphere stimulation: it increased the cost of invalid cueing. Our results suggest that TMS over the FEF facilitates visual detection, and thereby reduces reaction time. This finding provides new insights into the role of the human FEF in processing visual information. The functional asymmetry observed for both facilitation of visual detection and interference with shifts of attention provides further evidence for the dominance of the right hemisphere for those processes. Our results also underline that the disruptive or facilitative effect of TMS over a given region depends upon the behavioral context.

However. in Alzheimer disease (AD), Abeta accumulates forming- senile plaques in brain parenchyma and amyloid deposition around blood vessels, In this study, we tested at cellular level the relationship between neprilysin and Abeta in human healthy and AD brain. Our results provided evidence for declining levels of neprilysin in AD brains as compared to healthy controls in parallel with increasing deposition of Abeta. In hippocampus of AD individuals we observed a significant clown-regulation of neprilysin expression in pyramidal neurons, consistent with the possibility that neprilysin controls the level of Abeta accumulation and plaque formation in this area. In the cortex and leptomeninges, neprilysin was expressed in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. In sections from AD patients we observed a clear inverse relationship between neprilysin and Abeta peptide levels in the vasculature, implicating neprilysin in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

J	Bergeron, A; Guitton, D				Bergeron, A; Guitton, D			In multiple-step gaze shifts: Omnipause (OPNs) and collicular fixation neurons encode gaze position error; OPNs gate saccades	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; HEAD-FREE CAT; PONTINE RETICULAR-FORMATION; FRONTAL EYE FIELDS; DISCHARGE PATTERNS; PAUSE NEURONS; TECTORETICULOSPINAL SYSTEM; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; FASTIGIAL NUCLEUS; OCULOMOTOR REGION	The superior colliculus (SC), via its projections to the pons, is a critical structure for driving rapid orienting movements of the visual axis, called gaze saccades, composed of coordinated eye-head movements. The SC contains a motor map that encodes small saccade vectors rostrally and large ones caudally. A zone in the rostral pole may have a different function. It contains superior colliculus fixation neurons (SCFNs) with probable projections to omnipause neurons (OPNs) of the pons. SCFNs and OPNs discharge tonically during visual fixation and pause during single-step gaze saccades. The OPN tonic discharge inhibits saccades and its cessation (pause) permits saccade generation. We have proposed that SCFNs control the OPN discharge. We compared the discharges of SCFNs and OPNs recorded while cats oriented horizontally, to the left and right, in the dark to a remembered target. Cats used multiple-step gaze shifts composed of a series of small gaze saccades, of variable amplitude and number, separated by periods of variable duration (plateaus) in which gaze was immobile or moving at low velocity (<25&DEG;/s). Just after contralaterally (ipsilaterally) presented targets, the firing frequency of SCFNs decreased to almost zero (remained constant at background). As multiple-step gaze shifts progressed in either direction in the dark, these activity levels prevailed until the distance between gaze and target [gaze position error (GPE)] reached &SIM;16&DEG;. At this point, firing frequency gradually increased, without saccade-related pauses, until a maximum was reached when gaze arrived on target location (GPE = 0&DEG;). SCFN firing frequency encoded GPE; activity was not correlated to characteristics or occurrence of gaze saccades. By comparison, after target presentation to left or right, OPN activity remained steady at pretarget background until first gaze saccade onset, during which activity paused. During the first plateau, activity resumed at a level lower than background and continued at this level during subsequent plateaus until GPE &SIM;8&DEG; was reached. As GPE decreased further, tonic activity during plateaus gradually increased until a maximum (greater than background) was reached when gaze was on goal (GPE = 0&DEG;). OPNs, like SCFNs, encoded GPE, but they paused during every gaze saccade, thereby revealing, unlike for SCFNs, strong coupling to motor events. The firing frequency increase in SCFNs as GPE decreased, irrespective of trajectory characteristics, implies these cells get feedback on GPE, which they may communicate to OPNs. We hypothesize that at the end of a gaze-step sequence, impulses from SCFNs onto OPNs may suppress further movements away from the target.

Neuronal activity was recorded from 157 rubral neurons, including identified rubrospinal neurons, in three cats trained to walk on a treadmill and to step over obstacles attached to the moving belt. Of 72 neurons with a receptive field confined to the contralateral forelimb, 66 were phasically active during unobstructed locomotion. The maximal activity of the majority of neurons (59/66) was centered around the swing phase of locomotion. Slightly more than half of the neurons (36/66) were phasically activity during both swing and stance. In addition, some rubral neurons (14/66) showed multiple periods of phasic activity within the swing phase of the locomotor cycle. Periods of phasic discharge temporally coincident with the swing phase of the ipsilateral limb were observed in 7/66 neurons. During voluntary gait modifications, most forelimb-related neurons (70/72) showed a significant increase in their discharge activity when the contralateral limb was the first to step over the obstacle (lead condition). Maximal activity in nearly all cells (63/70) was observed during the swing phase, and 23/63 rubral neurons exhibited multiple increases of activity during the modified swing phase. A number of cells (18/70) showed multiple periods of increased activity during swing and stance. Many of the neurons (35/63, 56%) showed an increase in activity at the end of the swing phase; this period of activity was temporally coincident with the period of activity in wrist dorsiflexors, such as the extensor digitorum communis. A smaller proportion of neurons with receptive fields restricted to the hindlimbs showed similar characteristics to those observed in the population of forelimb-related neurons. The overall characteristics of these rubral neurons are similar to those that we obtained previously from pyramidal tract neurons recorded from the motor cortex during an identical task. However, in contrast to the results obtained in the rubral neurons, most motor cortical neurons showed only one period of increased activity during the step cycle. We suggest that both structures contribute to the modifications of the pattern of EMG activity that are required to produce the change in limb trajectory needed to step over an obstacle. However, the results suggest an additional role for the red nucleus in regulating intra- and interlimb coordination.

Weak electrical stimuli (2-ms pulse; intensity, 90% detected at rest) were applied to D2 at different delays before and after movement onset or electromyographic (EMG) activity onset. Significant time-dependent movement-related decreases in detection were obtained with all tasks. When the results obtained during the active isotonic movement task were compared with those obtained in the three test tasks, no significant differences in the functions describing detection performance over time were seen. The results obtained with the isometric D2 abduction task show that actual movement of a body part is not necessary to diminish detection of tactile stimuli in a manner similar to the decrease produced by isotonic, active movement. In the passive test task, the peak decrease in detection clearly preceded the onset of passive movement (by 38 ms) despite the lack of a motor command and, presumably, no movement- related peripheral reafference. A slightly but not significantly earlier decrease was obtained with active movement (49 ms before movement onset). Expectation of movement likely did not contribute to the results because stimulus detection during sham passive movement trials (subjects expected but did not receive a passive movement) was not different from performance at rest (no movement). The results obtained with passive movement are best explained by invoking backward masking of the test stimuli by movement- related reafference and demonstrate that movement- related reafference is sufficient to produce decreases in detection with a time course and amplitude not significantly different from that produced by active movement.

We have generated transgenic mice to reveal NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in vivo. As expected, constitutive NF-kappaB activity was observed within immune organs, and tumor necrosis factor-inducible NF-kappaB activity was present in mesenchymal cells. Intriguingly, NF-kappaB activity was also prominent in the CNS throughout development, especially within neocortex, olfactory bulbs, amygdala, and hippocampus. NF-kappaB in the CNS was restricted to neurons and blocked by overexpression of dominant-negative NF-kappaB-inducible kinase or the IkappaBalphaM super repressor. Blocking endogenous neuronal NF-kappaB activity in cortical neurons using recombinant adenovirus induced neuronal death, whereas induction of NF-kappaB activity increased levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and was strongly neuroprotective. Together, these data demonstrate a physiological role for NF-kappaB in maintaining survival of central neurons.

Multilevel modeling was applied to depression, stressful life events, and perceived social support assessed at termination and the 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups. Between-subjects and within-subjects effects were found for stress and support; a buffering effect of support on stress was also found. The slope of depression on stress was used to index stress reactivity during the follow-up. Stress reactivity was predicted by depressive personality at intake and by perfectionism at termination but not by the intensity of symptoms at termination. These findings suggest that patients' personality characteristics and their social environments are crucial determinants of their functioning after treatment ends.

On the Definition of Word: MIT Press, Cambridge, MA). Based on a review of research in linguistics, neurolinguistics, and developmental psychology, we argue that dividing the lexicon into categories such as noun and verb offers no descriptive edge, and adds unnecessary complexity to both the theory of grammar and language acquisition. Specifically, we argue that a theory without lexical categories provides a better account of creative language use and category-specific neurological deficits, while also offering a natural solution to the bootstrapping problem in language acquisition (Pinker, S., 1982.

There is abundant evidence that at early stages of the disease, prior to Abeta amyloid plaque formation, Abeta peptides accumulate intraneuronally in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. The experimental evidence would indicate that intracellular amyloid-beta could originate both by intracellular biosynthesis and also from the uptake of-amyloidogenic peptides from the extracellular milieu. Herein the aspects of the possible impact of intracellular amyloid-beta in human AD pathology are discussed, as well as recent observations from a rat transgenic model with a phenotype of intracellular accumulation of Abeta fragments in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex, without plaque formation. In this model, the intracellular amyloid-beta phenotype is accompanied by increased MAPK/ERK activity and tau hyperphosphorylation. Finally, the authors discuss the hypothesis that, prior to plaque formation, intracellular Abeta accumulation induces biochemical and pathological changes in the brain at the cellular level priming neurons to further cytotoxic attack of extracellular amyloidogenic peptides.

Traditional robust regression methods assume that the noise distribution is symmetric, and they downweight the influence of so-called outliers. When the noise distribution is asymmetric, these methods yield biased regression estimators. Motivated by data-mining problems for the insurance industry, we propose a new approach to robust regression tailored to deal with asymmetric noise distribution. The main idea is to learn most of the parameters of the model using conditional quantile estimators (which are biased but robust estimators of the regression) and to learn a few remaining parameters to combine and correct these estimators, to minimize the average squared error in an unbiased way. Theoretical analysis and experiments show the clear advantages of the approach. Results are on artificial data as well as insurance data, using both linear and neural network predictors.

Astrocytes accumulate manganese by a high affinity, high capacity, specific transport system. Chronic exposure to manganese leads to increased pallidal signal hyperintensities on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and selective neuronal loss in basal ganglia structures together with characteristic astrocytic changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis. Manganese is sequestered in mitochondria where it inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. Exposure of astrocytes to manganese results in important changes including (i) decreased uptake of glutamate; (ii) increased densities of binding sites for the "peripheral-type" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR), a class of receptor localized to mitochondria of astrocytes and involved in oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial proliferation, and neurosteroid synthesis; (iii) increased gene expression and activity of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), known to be associated with apoptosis; (iv) increased uptake of L-arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide, together with increased expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Potential consequences of these alterations in astrocytic gene expression include failure of energy metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased extracellular glutamate concentration and excitotoxicity which could play a key role in manganese-induced neuronal cell death as a direct result of impaired astrocytic-neuronal interactions.

J	Duchesne, S; Pruessner, JC; Collins, DL				Duchesne, S; Pruessner, JC; Collins, DL			Appearance-based segmentation of medial temporal lobe structures	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							BRAIN; HIPPOCAMPUS; MRI; REGISTRATION; MORPHOMETRY; VALIDATION; IMAGES	A new paradigm for the characterization of structure appearance is proposed, based on a combination of gray-level MRI intensity data and a shape descriptor derived from a priori principal components analysis of 3D deformation vector fields. Generated without external intervention, it extends into 3D more classic, 2D manual landmark-based shape models. Application of this novel concept led to a method for the segmentation of medial temporal lobe structures from brain magnetic resonance images. The strategy employed for segmentation aims at synthesizing, using the appearance model, a deformation field that maps a new volume onto a reference target. Any information defined on the reference can then be propagated back on the new volume instance, thereby achieving segmentation. The proposed method was tested on a data set of 80 normal subjects and compared against manual segmentation as well as automated segmentation results from ANIMAL, a nonlinear registration and segmentation technique. Experimental results demonstrated the robustness and flexibility of the new method. Segmentation accuracy, measured by overlap statistics, is marginally lower (< 2%) than ANIMAL, while processing time is six times faster. Finally, the applicability of this concept toward shape deformation analysis is presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The present study investigated whether subregions within the frontal cortex show different patterns of brain aging. Magnetic resonance images of 57 healthy participants between 21 and 81 years old were used to measure regional frontal gray matter volumes in three ways: a manual tracing method, a semiautomatic "Talairach boxes" volumetric method, and voxel-based morphometry. Seven regions within each hemisphere were manually traced: precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, dorsolateral frontal cortex, ventral medial region, lateral orbital region, anterior cingulate, and frontal pole. With the semiautomatic approach, four regions were measured: lateral, orbital, and medial frontal regions and frontal pole. Advancing age was strongly associated with decreases in the volume of the whole frontal cortex. Differential age effects on the volumes of frontal subregions were dependent on the method applied. According to the manual approach, age-related volume decreases were strongest in the lateral and orbital frontal gray matter. The semiautomatic and voxel-based analyses found that age effects were most prominent within the lateral frontal and cingulate regions. Overall, it was concluded that although semiautomated and voxel-based methods can provide a reasonable estimate of regional brain volume, they cannot serve as a substitute for manual volumetry.

We wished to examine whether the brain areas subserving control of sequential processes could be delineated by pure mental imagery, their activation levels reflecting the processing demands of a sequential task. We studied six right-handed volunteers (39.0 +/- 14 years) with (H2O)-O-15 positron emission tomography (PET) while they continuously mentally pursued with their right hand one of five sequences differing in complexity (i.e., increases in sequence length, single-finger repetitions, and reversals). Conditions were repeated twice, alternating with two rest scans. Each imagined single motor element was paced at a frequency of 1 Hz. Significant activation increases (P < 0.05, corrected) associated with imagination of right finger movement sequences (conditions I to V combined)-compared to the rest condition-were observed in left sensorimotor cortex (M1/S1) and the adjacent inferior parietal cortex. Further activation increases (P < 0.001, uncorrected) occurred in bilateral dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex, left caudal supplementary motor area, bilateral ventral premotor cortex, right M1, left superior parietal cortex, left putamen, and right cerebellum. Activation decreases occurred in bilateral prefrontal and right temporo-occipital cortex. Activation increases that correlated with sequence complexity were observed only in specific areas of the activated network, notably in left PMd, right superior parietal cortex, and right cerebellar vermis (P < 0.05, corrected). In conclusion, our study, by varying the sequence structure of imagined finger movements, identified task-related activity changes in parietopremotor-cerebellar structures, reflecting their role in mediating sequence control.

Its embryonic motor behaviors are easy to assess (e.g. for mutagenic screens). the embryos develop rapidly (hatching as larvae at 2 days) and are transparent, permitting calcium imaging and patch clamp recording in vivo. We review primarily the recent advances in understanding the cellular basis for the development of motor activities in the developing zebrafish. The motor activities are generated largely in the spinal cord and hindbrain. In the embryo these segmented structures possess a relatively small number of repeating sets of identifiable neurons. Many types of neurons as well as the two types of muscle cells have been classified based on their morphologies. Some of the molecular signals for cellular differentiation have been identified recently and mutations affecting cell development have been isolated. Embryonic motor behaviors appear in sequence and consist of an early period of transient spontaneous coiling contractions, followed by the emergence of twitching responses to touch, and later by the ability to swim. Coiling contractions are generated b) an electrically coupled network of a subset of spinal neurons whereas a chemical (glutamatergic and glycinergic) synaptic drive underlies touch responses and swimming. Swimming becomes sustained in larvae once the neuromodulatory serotonergic system develops, These results indicate many similarities between developing zebrafish and other vertebrates in the properties of the synaptic drive underlying locomotion. Therefore, the zebrafish is a useful preparation for gaining new insights into the development of the neural control of vertebrate locomotion. As the types of neurons, transmitters, receptors and channels used in the locomotor network are being defined, this open, the possibility of combining cellular neurophysiology with forward and reverse molecular genetics to understand the principles of locomotor network assembly and function.

Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, one of the most common forms of partial epilepsy in adulthood, is generally accompanied by a pattern of brain damage known as mesial temporal sclerosis. Limbic seizures can be mimicked in vitro using preparations of combined hippocampus-entorhinal cortex slices perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing convulsants or nominally zero Mg2+, in order to produce epileptiform synchronization. Here, we summarize experimental evidence obtained in such slices from rodents. These data indicate that in control animals: (i) prolonged, NMDA receptor-dependent epileptiform discharges, resembling electrographic limbic seizures, originate in the entorhinal cortex from where they propagate to the hippocampus via the perforant path-dentate gyrus route; (ii) the initiation and maintenance of these ictal discharges is paradoxically contributed by GABA (mainly type A) receptor-mediated mechanisms; and (iii) CA3 outputs, which relay a continuous pattern of interictal discharge at approximately 1 Hz, control rather than sustain ictal discharge generation in entorhinal cortex. Recent work indicates that such a control is weakened in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy (presumably as a result of CA3 cell damage). In addition, in these experiments electrographic seizure activity spreads directly to the CA1-subiculum regions through the temporoammonic pathway. Studies reviewed here indicate that these changes in network interactions, along with other mechanisms of synaptic plasticity (e.g. axonal sprouting, decreased activation of interneurons, upregulation of bursting neurons) can confer to the epileptic, damaged limbic system, the ability to produce recurrent limbic seizures as seen in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

Brains from AD patients show several distinct neuropathological features, including extracellular beta-amyloid-containing plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of abnormally phosphorylated tau, and degeneration of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. In this review, we will present evidence implicating involvement of the basal forebrain cholinergic system in AD pathogenesis and its accompanying cognitive deficits. We will initially discuss recent results indicating a link between cholinergic mechanisms and the pathogenic events that characterize AD, notably amyloid-beta peptides. Following this, animal models of dementia will be discussed in light of the relationship between basal forebrain cholinergic hypofunction and cognitive impairments in AD. Finally, past, present, and future treatment strategies aimed at alleviating the cognitive symptomatology of AD by improving basal forebrain cholinergic function will be addressed.

We sought to establish the safety of intravenous tPA in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in women who are actively menstruating. Summary of Report-We provide a case report and review of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) database for women coded as actively menstruating. Nine subjects were coded as actively menstruating in the NINDS trial (4 placebo and 5 in the treatment). One subject in the treatment group who had a 1-year history of dysfunctional uterine bleeding required emergent uterine artery ligation. We also report a case of a woman requiring transfusion after intravenous tPA administration for acute ischemic stroke. Conclusions-Intravenous tPA may be administered relatively safely in women who are menstruating and should be used with caution in women with a history of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Potential patients should be advised that they might require transfusion for increased menstrual flow.

Here we demonstrate a possible link between microsaccades and covert attention shifts. We designed two psychophysical tasks involving spatial cues that had identical sensory stimuli but differing patterns of attentional benefits and costs. We found that microsaccades, rather than being randomly distributed, had directions that were directly correlated with the directions of covert attention shifts' in the two tasks. Our results suggest that microsaccades occur because of subliminal activation of the oculomotor system by covert attention. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

As shown by reverse transcription-PCR, receptor autoradiography, and confocal microscopic localization of fluorescent NT, these cells selectively express the NTS2 receptor subtype. Accordingly, a single apparent class of I-125-NT-binding sites, with an affinity of 3.1 nM, was detected in cerebellar granule cell cultures. This binding was competed for with high affinity (IC50 = 5.7 nM) by the NTS2 ligand levocabastine and with low affinity (IC50 = 203 nM) by the NTS1 antagonist SR48692. Hypertonic acid stripping of surface-bound ligand and hyperosmolar sucrose treatment revealed that 64% of specifically bound I-125-NT was internalized at equilibrium via a clathrin-dependent pathway. In cells loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fluo4, SR48692, but neither NT nor levocabastine, triggered a marked increase in cytosolic [Ca2+](i). By contrast, both NT and levocabastine, but not SR48692, induced a sustained (>60 min) activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, p42/p44, indicating functional coupling of NTS2 receptors. Complementary experiments carried out on synaptosomes from adult rat cerebellum demonstrated the presence of presynaptic NTS2 receptors. However, in contrast to perikaryal NTS2 sites, these presynaptic receptors did not internalize in response to NT stimulation. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that NTS2 receptors are present both presynaptically and postsynaptically in central neurons and that NT and levocabastine act as agonists on these receptors.

This positron emission tomography (PET) experiment measured changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in normal human participants during the presentation of abstract visual information in four conditions that varied in their encoding demands. As encoding increased across the different conditions, there was an increase in activity in the right orbitofrontal cortex and the right parahippocampal region. No significant activation peaks were present in any other region of the frontal or temporal lobe. These findings indicate that the orbitofrontal cortex, which is massively connected to the medial temporal cortex, is a critical frontal region for memory formation.

Although a previous study had reported a U-shaped psychophysical function peaking at a nominal SP of 3.2 mm, differences in the surfaces (including changing SP in only one dimension as compared with two and higher dot heights that minimized contact with the smooth floor) likely contributed to the difference in the results. Roughness estimates were also unaffected by a 2-fold change in scanning speed (50 vs. 95 mm/s). Parallel recordings from neurones in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) during a texture discrimination task indicate that the discharge frequency of many SI cells shows a monotonic relation with SP (up to 5 mm tested). For some cells, the texture signals were ambiguous because discharge frequency co-varied with both texture and the scanning speed, as has also been reported for the peripheral mechanoreceptors that are activated by textured surfaces. Yet other SI cells showed a speed-invariant response to surface texture, consistent with perceptual constancy for roughness over a range of scanning speeds. We suggest that such a discharge pattern could be based on a simple intensive, or mean rate, code: an invariant central representation of surface texture could be obtained by subtracting a speed-varying signal from the ambiguous signals that co-vary with roughness and speed.

Ossification begins with elements associated with the caudal, anal, and second dorsal fins. Development of the haemal arches, caudal radials, and caudal neural arches continues anteriorly and posteriorly from near the level of the anterior margin of the caudal fin. Trunk neural arches ossify later than the caudal neural arches and as a separate sequence. Trunk intercentra most likely begin ossification posteriorly and continue forward after the ossification of haemal arches is complete. Comparisons of many different patterns of vertebral development within the modern actinopterygians demonstrates that the sequence of development in Eusthenopteron foordi is unique. The diverse patterns of vertebral development observed in fossil and modern fish presumably result from an interplay between the inherent anterior to posterior sequence of development controlled by the Hox genes, and varying selective forces imposed by the physical and biological environment in which the fish develop. Initiation of vertebral development in the caudal region of Eusthenopteron foordi can be attributed to selection for early function of the tail in propulsion. In contrast, vertebral development in Carboniferous amphibians typically proceeds from anterior to posterior. This may reflect development in the still water of ponds and lakes in contrast with the coastal environment inhabited by the hatchlings of Eusthenopteron foordi. The sequences of vertebral development seen in Carboniferous labyrinthodonts and lepospondyls are divergently derived from that observed in Eusthenopteron foordi.

Here, we examine agrin's role in synapse formation between cholinergic preganglionic axons and sympathetic neurons in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) using agrin-deficient mice. In dissociated cultures of SCG neurons, we found a significant decrease in the number of synapses with aggregates of presynaptic synaptophysin and postsynaptic neuronal acetylcholine receptor among agrin-deficient neurons as compared to wild-type neurons. Moreover, the levels of pre- and postsynaptic markers at the residual synapses in agrin-deficient SCG cultures were also reduced, and these defects were rescued by adding recombinant neural agrin to the cultures. Similarly, we observed a decreased matching of pre- and postsynaptic markers in SCG of agrin-deficient embryos, reflecting a decrease in the number of differentiated synapses in vivo. Finally, in electrophysiological experiments, we found that paired-pulse depression was more pronounced and posttetanic potentiation was significantly greater in agrin-deficient ganglia, indicating that synaptic transmission is also defective. Together, these findings indicate that neural agrin plays an organizing role in the formation and/or differentiation of interneuronal, cholinergic synapses.

METHOD AND RESULTS: We have combined paraquat-induced oxidative stress with sublethal increased exogenous glutamate, or thermal stress, or a combination of both, and demonstrate a synergistic effect of low-level stressors on the viability of motor neurons. CONCLUSION: This model of low-level oxidative stress reveals the subsequent vulnerability of motor neurons to genetic or environmental stressors and may in part explain the mid-life/late-life symptom onset in both familial and sporadic ALS patients.

These highly effective medications revolutionized our approach to mood disorders and helped launch the modem era of psychiatry. Yet our progress since those serendipitous discoveries has been disappointing. We still do not understand with certainty how those medications produce their desired clinical effects. We have not introduced newer medications with fundamentally different mechanisms of action than the older agents. We have not identified the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression and mania, nor do we understand the mechanisms by which nongenetic factors influence these disorders. We have only a rudimentary understanding of the circuits in the brain responsible for the normal regulation of mood and affect, and of those circuits that function abnormally in mood disorders. In approaching these gaps in our knowledge, this workgroup highlighted four major areas for future investment. These include developing better animal models of mood disorders; identifying genetic determinants of normal and abnormal mood in humans and animals; discovering novel targets and biomarkers of mood disorders and treatments; and increasing the recruitment of investigators from diverse backgrounds to mood disorders research.

Neurons migrate along specific migratory routes toward their final destinations, sometimes across long distances. However, the cellular and molecular interactions that control neuronal migration are largely unknown. Here, we examined the mechanism underlying the transmedian migration of precerebellar neurons using a flat whole-mount preparation of the rat embryo. These neurons were initially attracted by the floor plate (FP) at the ventral midline. However, after crossing the midline, they lost their responsiveness to the FP and became attracted by the alar plate (AP). Although the loss of responsiveness to FP cues was caused by an encounter of migrating cells with the FP, the gain of responsiveness to AP cues occurred irrespective of their encounter with the FP. These results identify a crucial change in the response of migrating cells to attractive guidance cues during the transmedian migration of precerebellar neurons. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Via diffuse projections through the brain, orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus may act on a number of wake-promoting systems. Among these are the intralaminar and midline thalamic nuclei, which project in turn in a widespread manner to the cerebral cortex within the nonspecific thalamocortical projection system. Testing the effect of orexin in rat brain slices, in two nuclei of this system, centromedial (CM) nuclei and rhomboid nuclei, we found that it depolarized and excited all neurons tested through a direct postsynaptic action. An additional analysis of this effect in CM neurons indicates that it results from the decrease of a potassium conductance. By a detailed comparison of the effects of orexin A and B, we established that orexin B was more potent than orexin A, indicating the probable mediation by orexin type 2 receptors. In contrast to its effect on the nonspecific thalamocortical projection neurons, orexin had no effect on the specific sensory relay neurons of the somatic, ventral posterolateral, and visual dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei. Orexin differs in this regard from norepinephrine and acetylcholine, to which neurons in the specific and nonspecific systems are sensitive. Orexin may thus act in the thalamus to promote wakefulness by exciting neurons of the nonspecific thalamocortical projection system, which, through widespread projections to the cerebral cortex, stimulate and maintain cortical activation.

Single action potentials were recorded from lateral pontine tegmental cells in urethane-anesthetized rats following antidromic activation from the ventral tegmental area and/or posterior mesencephalon. A total of 445 cells were recorded in 13 animals and of these, 44 were antidromically driven from the ventral tegmental area (n = 13 ipsi-, it = 5 contralateral), the posterior mesencephalon (n = 8 ipsi-, n = 5 midline), or from both sites (it = 13). The occurrence of collision between ortho- and antidromic action potentials triggered by concurrent stimulation of both sites is consistent with psychophysical data obtained previously in behaving animals, and likewise suggests that the two sites are linked by uninterrupted axons. In five of the cells that were driven from both sites, the inter-electrode conduction time exceeded the difference in latencies, suggesting that stimulation of the ventral tegmental area and posterior mesencephalon triggered action potentials in different axonal branches of the same cell. Estimates of the end of the absolute refractory period ranged from 0.44 to 1.6 ms (ventral tegmental area) and from 0.3 to 2.0 ms (posterior mesencephalon), times that overlap with behaviorally derived estimates for mesencephalic reward-relevant neurons. These results suggest that cells originating in the lateral pontine tegmentum might constitute part of the directly-stimulated substrate responsible for the rewarding effect of mesencephalic electrical brain stimulation.

In particular, the extremely conserved last 33-residue cytoplasmic subdomain was shown to bind to both a PDZ domain for one signaling pathway [Lu et al. (2001) Cell 105, 69-79] and an SH2 domain from an alternative signaling network [Cowan and Henkerneyer (2001) Nature 413, 174-179]. To date, no structural information is available for the cytoplasmic domain of ephrin B proteins. We report here a detailed NMR study on the structural and dynamic properties of the cytoplasmic domain of human ephrin B2. Our results reveal the following: (1) the N-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain from residues 253 to 300 lacks the ability for structure formation and is particularly prone to aggregation; and (2) the C-terminal functional subdomain from residues 301 to 333 assumes two distinctive structural elements with residues 301-322 adopting a well-packed hairpin structure followed by a flexible C-terminal tail. Furthermore, the backbone N-15 relaxation data demonstrate that the hairpin structure has significantly limited backbone motions, indicating a high conformational stability for the folded structure. Therefore, while the flexible C-terminal tail is suitable for binding to the PDZ domain, the folded hairpin may represent a latent structure requiring phosphorylation-induced conformational changes for high-affinity interactions with the SH2 domain.

The morphological analysis revealed that layer V of the LEA contains three distinct subtypes of principal neurons, which were classified as pyramidal, horizontal, and polymorphic neurons. Pyramidal cells were the most abundant subtype (57%) and could be further subdivided into neurons with large, small, and star-like somas. Similarly to pyramidal cells, horizontal neurons (11%) had a prominent apical dendrite. However, their distinctive basal dendritic plexus extended primarily in the horizontal plane. Polymorphic neurons (32%) were characterized by a multipolar dendritic organization. Electrophysiological analysis of neurons in the three categories demonstrated a diversity of electrophysiological profiles within each category and no significant differences between groups. Neurons in the three subgroups could display instantaneous and/or time-dependent inward rectification and different degrees of spike frequency adaptation. None of the recorded cells displayed an intrinsic oscillatory bursting discharge. Many neurons in the three subgroups, however, displayed slow (3.5-14 Hz), sustained, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. The morphological and electrophysiological diversity of principal neurons in the LEA parallels that previously reported for the medial entorhinal area and suggests that, with respect to the deep layers, similar information processing is performed across the mediolateral extent of the entorhinal cortex. Layer V of the entorhinal cortex may undertake very complex operations beyond acting as a relay station of hippocampal processed information to the neocortex.

Axons can extend neurites on growth inhibitory substrates when Rho is inactivated by C3-ADP-ribosyltransferase (C3). We found by Rho-GTP pull-down assay that inhibitory substrates activate Rho. To inactivate Rho, scrape. loading of C3 was necessary because it does not freely enter cells. To overcome the poor permeability of C3, we made and characterized five new recombinant C3-like chimeric proteins designed to cross the cell membrane by receptor-independent mechanisms. These proteins were constructed by the addition of short transport peptides to the carboxyl-terminal of C3 and tested using a bioassay measuring neurite outgrowth of PC-12 cells plated on growth inhibitory substrates. All five constructs stimulated neurite outgrowth but with different dose-response profiles. Biochemical properties of the chimeric proteins were examined using C3-05, the most effective construct tested. Gel shift assays showed that C3-05 retained the ability to ADP-ribosylate Rho. Western blots and immunocytochemistry were used to verify the presence of C3 inside treated cells. C3-05 was also effective at promoting neurite outgrowth in primary neuronal cultures, as well as causing the disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions complexes in fibroblasts. These studies demonstrate that the new C3-like proteins are effective in delivering biologically active C3 into different cell types, thereby, inactivating Rho.

We examined the ability of superoxide formed by the enzymatic reaction of xanthine with xanthine oxidase (X/XO) to induce autonomous activity of PKCs in Aplysia. X/XO stimulated autonomous PKC activity in Aplysia nervous system homogenates, but this activity resulted solely from activation of PKC Apl I. PKC ApI I is also more sensitive to activation by X/XO when expressed in insect cells. Our results suggest that oxidation can autonomously activate PKC ApI I in the Aplysia nervous system, but that the activation of PKC ApI II during synaptic facilitation is not due to oxidation of the enzyme.

Moreover, relatively little is known regarding the regulation of clathrin-mediated budding at other membrane systems. To address these issues, we have utilized the powerful new approach of subcellular proteomics to identify novel proteins present on highly enriched clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Among the ten novel proteins identified is the rat homologue of a predicted gene product from human, mouse, and Drosophila genomics projects, which we named enthoprotin. Enthoprotin is highly enriched on CCVs isolated from rat brain and liver extracts. In cells, enthoprotin demonstrates a punctate staining pattern that is concentrated in a perinuclear compartment where it colocalizes with clathrin and the clathrin adaptor protein (AP)l. Enthoprotin interacts with the clathrin adaptors AP1 and with Golgi-localized, gamma-ear-containing, Arf-binding protein 2. Through its COOH-terminal domain, enthoprotin binds to the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain and stimulates clathrin assembly. These data suggest a role for enthoprotin in clathrin-mediated budding on internal membranes. Our study reveals the utility of proteomics in the identification of novel vesicle trafficking proteins.

Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI) are ACE and neutral endopeptidase inhibitors and may increase natriuretic peptides, bradykinin, and perhaps endothelin-1 in patients with congestive heart failure. Patients (n = 107) with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association functional class II to III, with left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, and on ACE inhibitor therapy were randomized to either the VPI omapatrilat 40 mg/day or the ACE inhibitor lisinopril 20 mg/day. Trough levels of neurohormones (24 hours after dosing) were assessed at baseline, and at 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up. C-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide (C-ANP) levels decreased with lisinopril (p = 0.035), but not with omapatrilat. In contrast, N-terminal ANP levels did not change, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels tended to decrease similarly in both groups. Endothelin-1 levels increased in both groups, the increase reaching statistical significance with omapatrilat (p = 0.008). Levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 tended to decrease, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 increased in both groups, with statistical significance only for interleukin-10 with omapatrilat therapy. Neither agent changed catecholamines or angiotensin II. Thus, even at trough levels, omapatrilat potentiates C-ANP more than lisinopril. Potentially important effects of omapatrilat on endothelin-1 and antiinflammatory cytokines were identified, providing potential explanations for differences in clinical outcome.

In these studies we investigated the involvement of natriuretic peptides (ANP and brain natriuretic peptide) in the effects of chronic activation of imidazoline receptors. Methods: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR; 12 to 14 weeks old) received 7-day moxonidine treatment at various doses (10, 20, 60, and 120 mug/kg/h) via subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. Results: Hemodynamic parameters (continuously monitored by telemetry) revealed that, compared with saline-treated rats, moxonidine dose-dependently decreased blood pressures (BPs). Maximal blood pressure lowering effect was achieved by day 4 of treatment, at which point 60 mug/kg/h reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 14.5 +/- 6.8 mm Hg as compared with basal levels. The decrease in MAP was influenced by a drop in both diastolic and systolic pressures. Moxonidine treatment did not alter daily urinary sodium and potassium excretions, but 120 mug/kg/h moxonidine decreased urine volume after 2 days and increased cyclic guanosine 3'5' monophosphate excretion on days 4 to 7 of treatment. Chronic moxonidine treatment dose-dependently increased plasma ANP to reach, at 120 mug/kg/h, a 40% increase (P < .01) above that of corresponding saline-treated SHR, with a concomitant increase in left and right atrial ANP mRNA (more than twofold). Plasma BNP increased by 120 mug/kg/h moxonidine (11.0 +/- 1.1 v 16.5 +/- 1.9 pg/mL, P < .002) without significant increases in atrial and ventricular BNP mRNA. Conclusions: ANP and BNP may be involved in the antihypertensive effect of chronic moxonidine treatment. Accordingly, natriuretic peptides may contribute to the sympatholytic and cardioprotective effects of chronic activation of imidazoline I-1-receptors. (C) 2002 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

NHE3 epitope tagged with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein epitope (NHE3V) was stably expressed and called OK-E3V cells. On the basis of cell surface biotinylation studies, these cells had 10-15% of total NHE3 on the BB. Intracellular NHE3V largely colocalized with Rab11 and to a lesser extent with EEA1. The BB location of NHE3V was examined by confocal microscopy relative to the lectins wheat germ aggluttinin (WGA) and phytohemagluttin E (PHA-E), as well as the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB). The cells were pyramidal, and NHE3 was located in microvilli in the center of the apical surface. In contrast, PHA-E, WGA, and CTB were diffusely distributed on the BB. Detergent extraction showed that total NHE3V was largely soluble in Triton X-100, whereas virtually all surface NHE3V was insoluble. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation demonstrated that total NHE3V migrated at the same size as similar to400- and similar to900-kDa standards, whereas surface NHE3V was enriched in the similar to900-kDa form. Under basal conditions, NHE3 cycled between the cell surface and the recycling pathway through a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent mechanism. Measurements of surface and intracellular pH were obtained by using FITC-WGA. Internalization of FITC-WGA occurred largely into the juxtanuclear compartment that contained Rab11 and NHE3V. pH values on the apical surface and in endosomes in the presence of the NHE3 blocker, S3226, were elevated, showing that NHE3 functioned to acidify both compartments. In conclusion, NHE3V in OK cells exists in distinct domains both in the center of the apical surface and in a juxtanuclear compartment. In the BB fraction, NHE3 is largely in the detergent-insoluble fraction in lipid rafts and/or in large heterogenous complexes ranging from similar to400 to similar to900 kDa.

However, relaxants are used immediately after induction of anesthesia. The study was designed to determine the influence of the duration of anesthesia and N2O on the onset time at the adductor pollicis (AP) and the corrugator supercilii (CS) muscles of maximum neuromuscular blockade after mivacurium. Methods: After institutional approval and informed consent, patients were randomly allocated into three groups. Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil and propofol. Group A (n = 10) received mivacurium (0.1 mg/kg) immediately after loss of consciousness. Groups B (n = 10) and C (n = 10) received mivacurium after 15 min of anesthesia with propofol alone (B) or propofol with N2O (C). The evoked response to train-of-four stimulation was measured by acceleromyography at the AP and the CS. Results: Maximum neuromuscular blockade (%T1, median [range]) was significantly less in group A than in groups B and C (P < 0.001) at both the AP (81 [47-90]; 90 [35-100]; 100 [93-100], respectively) and the CS (19 [5-63]; 68 [61-100]; 89 [72-100], respectively). Maximum neuromuscular blockade was less in group B than in group C (P < 0.001) at the AP. Onset time of maximum neuromuscular blockade was not different between groups but was shorter at the CS than at the AP. Conclusions: Duration of anesthesia and N2O before mivacurium injection affect intensity of neuromuscular blockade but not onset time. Neuromuscular blockade obtained at the AP after several minutes of stable anesthesia with N2O is greater than immediately after induction. This explains in part the discrepancy between the measured ED95 and the intubating dose.

As this enzyme is largely distributed, it cannot be excluded that these isomers might undergo peripheral elimination. This hypothesis was investigated in patients by measuring the difference between arterial and venous concentrations under a constant-rate continuous infusion of mivacurium. Methods: During propofol-remifentanil anesthesia, eight adult consenting patients received an intravenous bolus dose of 0.2 mg/kg mivacurium, followed by a constant infusion (3, 5, or 7 mug (.) kg(-1) (.) min(-1)) into the brachial vein. One hour after starting the infusion, arterial (radial artery) and venous (contralateral brachial vein) blood samples were drawn simultaneously at 15-min intervals for 45 min. Mivacurium isomers and metabolite plasma concentrations were determined by stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatography. Using the corresponding arterial and venous concentrations, the tissue extraction coefficient as well as total body clearance were calculated. Results: During steady state conditions, the venous concentrations of the trans trans and cis trans isomers were 34 +/- 13% and 42 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD) lower than the corresponding arterial concentrations (P < 0.05), respectively. For the cis cis isomer, the difference between venous and arterial concentrations was 3 +/- 4% (P = 0.063). Total body clearances of the trans trans and cis trans isomers were greater when based on venous sampling (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a constant infusion of mivacurium depend heavily on the sampling site (arterial or venous) for the rapidly hydrolyzed isomers. These results strongly suggest a significant metabolism of mivacurium within muscle tissue that may account for the large interpatient variability in response to mivacurium.

Anatomical and functional evidence for participation in processes of arousal and awareness	BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Review						thalamus	PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS-LEUCOAGGLUTININ; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; BASAL AMYGDALOID AFFERENTS; SUB-CORTICAL AFFERENTS; HIPPOCAMPAL FIELD CA1; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; PHA-L ANALYSIS; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; REUNIENS-THALAMI; SUBCORTICAL PROJECTIONS	The thalamic midline and intralaminar nuclei, long thought to be a non-specific arousing system in the brain, have been shown to be involved in separate and specific brain functions, such as specific cognitive, sensory and motor functions. Fundamental to the participation of the midline and intralaminar nuclei in such diverse functions seems to be a role in awareness. It is unknown whether the midline and intralaminar nuclei, together often referred to as the 'non-specific' nuclei of the thalamus, act together or whether each nucleus is involved idiosyncratically in separate circuits underlying cortical processes. Detailed knowledge of the connectivity of each of these nuclei is needed to judge the nature of their contribution to cortical functioning. The present account provides an overview of the results of neuroanatomical tracing studies on the connections of the individual intralaminar and midline thalamic nuclei in the rat, that have been performed over the past decade in our laboratory. The results are discussed together with those reported by other laboratories, and with those obtained in other species. On the basis of the patterns of the afferent and efferent projections, we conclude that the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei can be clustered into four groups. Each of the groups can be shown to have its own set of target and input structures, both cortically and subcortically. These anatomical relationships, in combination with functional studies in animals and in humans, lead us to propose that the midline and intralaminar nuclei as a whole play a role in awareness, with each of the groups subserving a role in a different aspect of awareness. The following groups can be discerned: (1) a dorsal group, consisting of the paraventricular, parataenial and intermediodorsal nuclei, involved in viscero-limbic functions; (2) a lateral group, comprising the central lateral and paracentral nuclei and the anterior part of the central medial nucleus, involved in cognitive functions; (3) a ventral group, made up of the reuniens and rhomboid nucleus and the posterior part of the central medial nucleus, involved in multimodal sensory processing; (4) a posterior group, consisting of the centre median and parafascicular nuclei, involved in limbic motor functions.

Specifically, studies on luminance, colour, motion, texture, and symmetry processing are reported. Furthermore, experiments on the capacity to retain size and spatial frequency information are also discussed. The general conclusion is that there are a number of perceptual abilities that diminish with age. However, the extent of these deficits will depend on the complexity of the neural circuitry involved for processing a given task. This is also true for Visual working memory where no evidence of loss due to aging is demonstrated for processing low-level Visual information, when individual differences in sensory input are compensated for. it is concluded that perceptual processing deficits due to aging (like working memory) will become evident when the Computational load reaches a certain level of complexity (larger or more complex network) even if the tasks remain cognitively simple.

Here, these studies are reviewed with respect to exposure, effects and intervention, Although mercury (Hg) levels in piscivorous fish are similar in both regions, in the Amazon, fish constitutes the dietary mainstay, while in Quebec. fish consumption is primarily occasional. Mercury exposure of Amazonian fish eaters was considerably higher than Quebec (Median blood total Hg: 28 and I mug/l, respectively), but fish from the St, Lawrence contain multiple contaminants, For the Tapajos River. increasing hair Hg was associated with reduced motor and visual functions. Comparison of neurobehavioral performance of Quebec fish-eaters and non fish-caters showed a consistent pattern of information processing slowing among the former, these deficits were not related to blood methyl Hg levels. Early changes associated with exposure can be used to trigger intervention. Since fish provide important essential nutrients, mitigation must balance the beneficial and harmful effects. In Canada. advisories from environmental and health agencies consider both these aspects. In the Amazon, we are currently involved in a participatory research whose goal is to reduce Hg absorption, while maintaining fish consumption. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lortie, A; Plouin, P; Chiron, C; Delalande, O; Dulac, O				Lortie, A; Plouin, P; Chiron, C; Delalande, O; Dulac, O			Characteristics of epilepsy in focal cortical dysplasia in infancy	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						partial seizures; infancy; infantile spasms; focal cortical dysplasia; epilepsy surgery	POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; INFANTILE SPASMS; PARTIAL SEIZURES; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS; WEST-SYNDROME; CORTEX; MALFORMATIONS; DISORDERS; CHILDHOOD	To describe the poorly known characteristics of epilepsy during infancy in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), one of the most frequent cause of infantile epilepsy. All 28 patients with FCD referred to two specialized centres were retrospectively studied regarding seizure characteristics, psychomotor evaluation, and response to medical and surgical treatment. All patients presented with early partial seizures. Semiology, but not the age of onset, depended on the topography of the dysplasia, with abnormal eye movements in all cases of posterior FCD. Eleven patients also developed infantile spasms (IS), mainly asymmetrical. IS were easily controlled with Vigabatrin or ACTH, but no partial seizures could be medically controlled except in one patient. All patients except one had abnormal neuropsychological findings. Fifteen patients had surgery, eight became seizure free, and seven were significantly improved regarding psychomotor development. Very early and refractory partial seizures, but easily controlled IS are the main characteristics of FCD in infancy. Only the focal ictal semiology may help differentiate the localization of FCD. Its intrinsic epileptogenicity could sustain this clinical pattern. Since the chances for medical control and normal neurodevelopment are poor, surgical treatment should be considered early in infants with FCD. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lucas, G; Debonnel, G				Lucas, G; Debonnel, G			5-HT4 receptors exert a frequency-related facilitatory control on dorsal raphe nucleus 5-HT neuronal activity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; IN-VIVO; SEROTONIN; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; ANTAGONIST; MIRTAZAPINE; INHIBITION; RESPONSES	We investigated, using single-unit recordings in chloral hydrate-anaesthetized rats, the role of serotonin(4) (5-HT4 ) receptors in the control of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neuron activity. About one-half (36) of the 76 neurons recorded were affected by either the preferential 5-HT4 agonist cisapride (500 and 1000 mug/kg, i.v.) or the selective 5-HT4 antagonist, GR 125487 (200- 2000 mug/kg, i.v.). Responding neurons displayed a significantly higher mean basal firing rate (1.93 +/- 0.1 Hz) than non-responders (1.31 +/- 0.1 Hz). The firing rate of responding 5-HT neurons was enhanced dose-dependently by cisapride (+47 and +94% at 500 and 1000 mug/kg, respectively), an effect abolished by GR 125487 (500 mug/kg) and reduced by the 5-HT4 antagonist, SDZ 205557 (500 mug/kg, i.v). Conversely, GR 125487 induced a dose-dependent inhibition of responders activity, which was almost completely suppressed at the dose of 2000 mug/kg. In a separate set of experiments, the selective 5-HT4 agonist, prucalopride (500 mug/kg, i.v), increased the firing activity (+35%) of 5-HT neurons displaying a high basal firing rate; subsequent injection of GR 125487 (500 mug/kg, i.v.) suppressed this effect. These results indicate that 5-HT4 receptors exert both a tonic and a phasic, positive, frequency-related control on DRN 5-HT neuronal activity. The existence of such a control might open new avenues for therapeutic research in the antidepressant field.

J	Petit, A; Quenneville, N; Vallee, A; Pierret, P; Doucet, G				Petit, A; Quenneville, N; Vallee, A; Pierret, P; Doucet, G			Differences in host serotonin innervation of intrastriatal grafts are not determined by a glial scar or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						axon growth; serotonin; neural transplantation; astrogliosis; glial scar; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans; striatum; substantia nigra; immunohistochemistry; neonatal; adult	VENTRAL MESENCEPHALIC GRAFTS; LATERAL GANGLIONIC EMINENCE; FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; NEONATAL RAT-BRAIN; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; SPINAL-CORD; ASTROGLIAL RESPONSE; STAB WOUNDS; ADULT-RATS; ASTROCYTES	Serotoninergic (5-HT) neurons of adult recipients provide a much denser innervation of striatal than ventral mesencephalic grafts implanted into the neostriatum of the rat. Moreover, grafts from both brain regions are more innervated by host 5-HT axons after implantation in neonatal than adult hosts. To test the hypothesis that differences in glial scarring or expression of the growth inhibitory molecules, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG), be responsible for these differences in 5-HT innervation of neural grafts, we examined the 5-HT innervation, the astroglial reaction and the expression of CSPG in ventral mesencephalic grafts implanted into newborn (1-5 days old), juvenile (15 days old), or adult rats and in striatal grafts implanted in adult rats, using immunohistochemistry against 5-HT, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CSPG. Immunostaining for GFAP showed a stronger initial gliosis (1-10 days after grafting) in neonatal than adult recipients of mesencephalic grafts, but this gliosis subsided gradually at later time points. Nevertheless, a glial scar formed at the graft-host interface in both neonatal and adult recipients, 5-10 days after transplantation, although it decreased over a longer time course- up to 60 days-in adults. Immunostained astrocytes appeared first in the host brain tissue around the graft and then immunoreactive processes and perikarya gradually invaded the graft. Immunoreactivity for CSPG was similar in neonatal and adult hosts: it was strongly expressed inside the graft early after transplantation, and almost completely downregulated at 60 days. The reaction of adult hosts to striatal and mesencephalic grafts was similar, although GFAP was more heterogeneously distributed and CSPG immunoreactivity remained in patches inside striatal grafts, even after 60 days. The 5-HT innervation of mesencephalic grafts was much denser after implantation in newborns than in adults. It was also stronger in striatal than in mesencephalic grafts implanted in adults. Thus, the presence of a glial scar or the expression of CSPG cannot totally account for the different degrees of 5-HT innervation in the various types of neural grafts.

J	Karelis, AD; Peronnet, F; Gardiner, PF				Karelis, AD; Peronnet, F; Gardiner, PF			Glucose infusion attenuates muscle fatigue in rat plantaris muscle during prolonged indirect stimulation in situ	EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							NA+-K+ PUMP; CARBOHYDRATE INGESTION; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; GLYCOGEN-METABOLISM; EXERCISE; FIBERS; ACTIVATION; SUPPLEMENTATION; CONTRACTILITY; MECHANISMS	Carbohydrate ingestion increases both endurance time to exhaustion during prolonged exercise, and the ability to perform resistance exercise. The mechanism(s)underlying the increased performance following glucose ingestion remain (s) unclear. The purpose of the present study was to verify the hypothesis that glucose infusion could attenuate peripheral muscle fatigue in the anaesthetized rat during prolonged indirect electrical stimulation in situ. For this purpose the plantaris muscle was electrically stimulated (50 Hz for 200 ms every 2.7 s; 5 V; pulse width, 0.05 ms) in situ through the sciatic nerve to perform concentric contractions for 60 min while infusing intravenously either saline alone (7.25 ml kg(-1) h(-1)), or saline and glucose (1 g kg(-1) h-(1:) plasma glucose 11+/-1.1, vs. 4.9+/-0.2 mM with infusion of saline) (8 rats per group). Glucose infusion attenuated the reduction in submaximal. peak dynamic force (55% decrease vs. 70% decrease in rats infused with saline alone, P<0.05). In a third group of rats (n=8), infusion of glucose 30 min after the start of stimulation partially restored submaximal peak dynamic force (P<0.05). Maximum dynamic and isometric forces at the end of the period of stimulation were also higher (P<0.05) in rats infused with glucose (4.0&PLUSMN;0.2 and 4.3&PLUSMN;0.2 N, respectively) than saline alone (3.0&PLUSMN;0.2 and 3.5&PLUSMN;0.2 N, respectively). The beneficial effect of glucose infusion on peripheral muscle force during prolonged stimulation was not associated with a reduction in muscle glycogen utilisation, nor with a reduction of fatigue at the neuromuscular junction, as assessed through maximal direct muscle stimulation (200 Hz for 200 ms; 150 V; pulse width, 0.05 ms). However, changes in M-wave peak-to-peak amplitude, duration and total area suggest that glucose infusion, and/or the associated increase in plasma insulin concentration, may prevent the deterioration of electrical properties of the muscle fibre membrane.

Incel (biricodar, VX-710) restores drug sensitivity to P-glycoprotein (MDR1) and multidrug-resistance-associated protein (MRP1) expressing cells. This phase II study evaluated the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of VX-710 plus paclitaxel in women with advanced ovarian cancer refractory to prior paclitaxel therapy. Experimental design. Eligible patients had paclitaxel-refractory disease defined as progressive disease after a minimum of two cycles of paclitaxel (weekly or 3-week schedule) or relapsed disease within 4 months of prior paclitaxel therapy. Patients received 80 mg/m(2) paclitaxel over 3 h starting 4 h after initiation of a 24-h continuous intravenous infusion of 120 mg/m(2)/h VX-710. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. Results. Fifty patients received treatment and 45 were evaluable for response. VX-710 + paclitaxel therapy was generally well tolerated. Myelosuppression was the principal toxicity, with a median Cycle I nadir absolute neutrophil count of 0.27 X 10(9) cells/L and a 47% overall incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia. Mild to moderate peripheral neuritis or neuropathy was the primary nonhematologic toxicity, affecting 62% of patients. Other nonhematologic toxicities were generally mild to moderate and reversible. Paclitaxel area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) (16 +/- 5.3 mug X h/mL) during the first treatment cycle was comparable to standard 175 mg/m(2) paclitaxel administered over 3 h. Of the 3 patients who achieved partial responses, 2 had progressed during prior paclitaxel therapy. Twelve patients maintained stable disease and 14/45 (31%) of patients had CA-125 reductions of 50-90% for up to 24 weeks. The median time-to-disease progression was 10 weeks for the intent-to-treat population and 20.7 weeks for the CA-125 responders. Conclusions. The results suggest that VX-710 with paclitaxel has modest activity in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer. Further research is warranted in less heavily treated patients.

Comparisons with fixed structure neural networks are performed to demonstrate and illustrate the training and the generalization capabilities of the proposed adaptive constructive networks. The influence of quantization effects as well as comparison with the baseline JPEG scheme are also investigated. It has been demonstrated through several experiments that very promising results are obtained as compared to presently available techniques in the literature.

There are also other surgical and medical applications. ECC can be used for encephalic arteries surgery to induce hypothermia and maximally protect the brain. Femoro-femoral ECC may be needful for urgent traumatologic surgery of the supra-aortic trunci. Intracranial aneurysm repair can occasionally necessitate deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest with ECC. Renal cell carcinomas may metastasize to the right atrium and surgery with ECC is mandatory for complete excision. Some reports in the literature mention use of ECC for hepatic surgery of intra-hepatic aneurysms. With acute peripheral ischemia, metabolites in the affected limb can be washed out with good results. Medical indications for ECC are numerous with pulmonary assistance as one of the foremost when mechanical ventilation failed. Homogenous and rapid rewarming of hypothermic patients can be achieved with ECC. Finally, some groups have reported the use of ECC to administer chemotherapy in limb melanoma.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of neural networks as potential models capable of forecasting daily streamflows. Once an appropriate network has been identified, a comparison approach is used to evaluate it against a conceptual model presently in use by the Alcan Company. The Mistassibi River, located in northeastern Quebec, serves as the case study, and results based on mean square errors and Nash coefficients show that artificial neural networks outperform the deterministic model PREVIS for up to 5-day-ahead forecasts. Moreover, the results obtained with the neural network are also superior to the ones obtained with a classic autoregressive model coupled with a Kalman filter.

Methods: Gentle rocking motion associated with this type of manual therapy was imparted to the upper limbs and body of 30 patients for 20 minutes. A pretest and 2 posttests (at 1 and 11 minutes after the treatment, respectively) were performed, consisting of electromyographic (EMG) recordings of the flexor carpi radialis and extensor digitorum communis while the patient's wrist was passively flexed and extended with an amplitude of 60degrees and a frequency of 1 Hz. Patients received the treatment on the most rigid side of their bodies (ipsi-group) or on the contralateral. side (contra-group). Half of patients in each group received the treatment while lying supine on a massage table (ipsi- and contra-supine) or sitting in a chair (ipsi- and contra-sitting). Results: In general, the level of ESR were reduced by 36% immediately after treatment and remained 32% lower than pretest values 11 minutes after treatment (F = 41.45, P <.05). Patients who received the treatment lying supine benefited from a 42% reduction of ESR (F = 4.07, P <.05). The side on which the treatment was, performed did not significantly influence the outcome of the treatment (F = 0.50, P >.05). However, post hoc analysis of the triple interaction (test x side x position) indicated that the sitting position was much less efficient for sustained contralateral effect (P >.05). Conclusions: Results from the present study strongly suggest that it is possible to modify the level of ESR by using Trager therapy. This stretch reflex inhibition may induce a reduction of the muscle rigidity seen in these patients. The present results may eventually lead to the development of a specific complementary therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease and rigidity.

To study whether I-Na is homogeneous within the heart, we applied whole-cell voltage clamp technique to evaluate fast voltage-gated I-Na in atrial and ventricular myocytes isolated from guinea pig heart. It was found that the density of inward I-Na was 50% greater at -35mV in atrial (-42.6 +/- 2.9 pA/pF) than in ventricular (-27.5 +/- 1.8 pA/pF, P < 0.01) myocytes. The half activation and inactivation voltages (V-0.5) Of I-Na in atrial myocytes were shifted 4.5 +/- 0.2 and 9.6 +/- 0.3 mV negative to those of ventricular myocytes. Time constants for I-Na activation (tau(m)) and inactivation (tau(h)) were twice as rapid in atrial as in ventricular myocytes. The tau(m) and tau(h) were 0.34 +/- 0.03 and 1.36 +/- 0.07 ms for atrial myocytes, and 0.69 +/- 0.05 and 3.27 +/- 0.23 ms for ventricular myocytes, respectively. Recovery of I-Na from inactivation was slower in atrial than in ventricular myocytes, whereas the development of resting state inactivation was more rapid in atrial (tau = 67.5 +/- 4.3 ms) than in ventricular (152.8 +/- 7.5 ins, P < 0.01) myocytes. The results reveal marked heterogeneity of I-Na in the density and biophysical properties in atrial and ventricular myocytes. and the study suggests the potential possibility of tissue specific cardiac sodium channel isoforms.

We show that it is a potent inhibitor of neurite outgrowth from rat cerebellar granule and hippocampal cells; from dorsal root ganglion explants in which growth cone collapse was observed; from rat retinal ganglion neurons; and from NG108 and PC12 cells. OMgp purified by a different procedure from both mouse and human myelin behaves identically in all bioassays tested.

J	Marcinkiewicz, M				Marcinkiewicz, M			beta APP and furin mRNA concentrates in immature senile plaques in the brain of Alzheimer patients	JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						beta-amyloid precursor protein; dystrophic dendrites; microtubule-associated protein (MAP2); neurofilament protein 200; presenile Alzheimer's disease stage; proprotein convertase; senile plaque construction and deconstruction	AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; HEREDITARY CEREBRAL-HEMORRHAGE; ALPHA-SECRETASE CLEAVAGE; INSITU HYBRIDIZATION; DISINTEGRIN METALLOPROTEASE; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; CONVERTING-ENZYME; DIFFUSE PLAQUES; MESSENGER-RNAS; CELL BIOLOGY	This study examined the possibility that in Alzheimer disease (AD) beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) mRNA is delivered to senile plaques (SPs) via dendritic processes. betaAPP mRNA was detected in SPs by in situ hybridization, using a 1.4-kb cRNA in which both [S-35]-UTP and [S-35]-CTP were incorporated together. The PAPP mRNA was compared with that of furin, a proteolytic enzyme putatively involved in betaAPP processing, and its orthologue proprotein convertase PC1 served as a control. Human presenile AD cases with mostly immature SPs and AD cases generally with mature SPs were analyzed. To decrypt SPs after hybridization, brain sections were stained with thioflavin S. To establish relationships between the density of dystrophic fibers, the degree of plaque maturation, and the concentration of mRNA in SPs, the plaque maturity markers Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(1-40) peptides were co-localized with neurofilament protein 200 and compared with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP 2). The results suggest that immature, Abeta(1-42)- and dystrophic dendrite-containing SPs (but not mature SPs containing Abeta(1-40) and missing dystrophic dendrites) are capable of concentrating specific mRNAs. Dystrophic dendrites may thus serve as a route for the transport of specific mRNAs from the cell bodies to SPs.

In current-clamp experiments, application of carbachol (CCh) induced a slowly developing, prolonged depolarization initially accompanied by a slight decrease or no significant change in input resistance. By contrast, in a later phase of the depolarization input resistance appeared consistently increased. To elucidate the ionic bases of these effects, voltage-clamp experiments were then carried out. In recordings performed in nearly physiological ionic conditions at the holding potential of -60 mV, CCh application promoted the slow development of an inward current deflection consistently associated with a prominent increase in current noise. Similarly to voltage responses to CCh, this inward-current induction was abolished by the muscarinic antagonist, atropine. Current-voltage relationships derived by applying ramp voltage protocols during the different phases of the CCh-induced inward-current deflection revealed the early induction of an inward current that manifested a linear current/voltage relationship in the subthreshold range and the longer-lasting block of an outward K+ current. The latter current could be blocked by 1 mM extracellular Ba2+, which allowed us to study the CCh-induced inward current (I CCh) in isolation. The extrapolated reversal potential of the isolated I-CCh was approximate to0 mV and was not modified by complete substitution of intrapipette K+ with Cs+. Moreover, the extrapolated I-CCh reversal shifted to approximately -20 mV on removal of 50% extracellular Na+. These results are consistent with I-CCh being a nonspecific cation current. Finally, noise analysis of I-CCh returned an estimated conductance of the underlying channels of similar to13.5 pS. We conclude that the depolarizing effect of muscarinic stimuli on entorhinal-cortex layer-II principal neurons depends on both the block of a K+ conductance and the activation of a "noisy" nonspecific cation current. We suggest that the membrane current fluctuations brought about by I-CCh channel noise may facilitate the "theta" oscillatory dynamics of these neurons and enhance firing reliability and synchronization.

The 5-HT(3)A receptor subunit was expressed selectively in a subset of GABAergic interneurons coexpressing cholecystokinin (CCK) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The 5-HT3B subunit was never detected, indicating that 5-HT(3)Rs expressed by neocortical interneurons did not contain this subunit. In 5-HT3A-expressing VIP/CCK interneurons, serotonin induced fast membrane potential depolarizations by activating an inward current that was blocked by the selective 5-HT3R antagonist tropisetron. Furthermore, we observed close appositions between serotonergic fibers and the dendrites and somata of 5-HT3R-expressing neurons, suggestive of possible synaptic contacts. Indeed, in interneurons exhibiting rapid excitation by serotonin, local electrical stimulations evoked fast EPSCs of large amplitude that were blocked by tropisetron. Finally, 5-(HTR)-R-3-expressing neurons were also excited by a nicotinic agonist, indicating that serotonergic and cholinergic fast synaptic transmission could converge onto VIP/CCK interneurons. Our results establish a clear correlation between the presence of the 5-HT(3)A receptor subunit in neocortical VIP/CCK GABAergic interneurons, its functional expression, and its synaptic activation by serotonergic afferent fibers from the brainstem raphe nuclei.

The aim of the present study was to assess, using in vivo extracellular unitary recordings, the effect of acute and sustained administration of YM992 (40 mg kg(-1) day(-1) s.c., using osmotic minipumps) on the spontaneous firing activity of locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) neurons. Acute intravenous injection of YM992 (4 mg kg(-1)) significantly decreased NE neuron firing activity by 29% and blocked the inhibitory effect of a subsequent injection of the 5-HT2 agonist DOI [1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride]. A 2-day treatment with YM992 decreased the firing rate of NE neurons by 66%, whereas a partial recovery was observed after a 7-day treatment and a complete one after a 21-day treatment. Following the injection of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (1 mg kg(-1) i.v.), NE neuron firing was equalized in controls and 2-day YM992-treated rats. This put into evidence an increased degree of activation of alpha(2)-adrenergic autoreceptors in the treated rats. The suppressant effect of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine was significantly decreased in long-term YM992-treated rats. The recovery of LC firing activity after long-term YM992 administration could thus be explained by a decreased sensitivity of alpha(2)-adrenergic autoreceptors. Sustained SSRI administration leads to a gradual reduction of the firing activity of NE neurons during long-term administration, whereas YM992 produced opposite effects. The exact basis for the increased synaptic availability of NE by YM992 remains to be elucidated. This NE activity, resulting from 5-HT reuptake inhibition plus 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, might confer additional benefits in affective and anxiety disorders.

To assess effects of ethanol on the interaction of glutamate and glycine receptors, glycine-induced current (I-Gly) was recorded by a whole-cell patch-clamp technique from neurons freshly dissociated from the ventral tegmental area of rats. A conditioning prepulse of glutamate (1-3 s, 1 mM) significantly and reversibly potentiated responses to a pulse of glycine. This potentiation was increased when extracellular calcium was raised to 12 mM and reduced by including 10 mM 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid in the internal recording medium. It was not affected by 5 muM 1-N,O-bis-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (KN-62), a selective inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. In a concentration-response analysis, a conditioning pulse of glutamate significantly lowered the EC50 for glycine and increased the maximal I-Gly. Kinetic analysis of the currents indicated that glutamate slowed deactivation of glycine-gated chloride channels; therefore, glutamate may increase the affinity of glycine receptors for glycine. When coapplied with glycine, ethanol (10 mM) potentiated I-Gly in 35% of neurons from the ventral tegmental area. In contrast, when coapplied with glutamate and glycine, ethanol suppressed the glutamate-induced potentiation of I-Gly in these neurons. This suppression was also observed when ethanol and glycine were coapplied after a glutamate prepulse. A similar effect was observed when ethanol alone did not potentiate I-Gly. These findings suggest that glutamate-induced calcium influx modulates glycine receptors by a mechanism that can be blocked by ethanol.

Pyramidal cells of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of Apteronotus leptorhynchus generate burst discharge in relation to specific features of sensory input in vivo that resemble those recognized as gamma frequency discharge when examined in vitro. We have shown that these bursts are generated by an entirely novel mechanism termed conditional backpropagation that involves an intermittent failure of dendritic Na+ spike conduction. Conditional backpropagation arises from a frequency-dependent broadening of dendritic spikes during repetitive discharge, and a mismatch between the refractory periods of somatic and dendritic spikes. A high threshold class of K+ channel, AptKv3.3, is expressed at high levels and distributed over the entire soma-dendritic axis of pyramidal cells. AptKv3.3 channels are shown to contribute to the repolarization of both somatic and dendritic spikes, with pharmacological blockade of dendritic Kv3 channels revealing an important role in controlling the threshold for burst discharge. The entire process of conditional back-propagation and burst output is successfully simulated using a new compartmental model of pyramidal cells that incorporates a cumulative inactivation of dendritic K+ channels during repetitive discharge. This work is important in demonstrating how the success of spike backpropagation can control the output of a principle sensory neuron, and how this process is regulated by the distribution and properties of voltage-dependent K+ channels.

EMD 128 130 is a novel compound acting as an agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor, and as an antagonist at the dopamine-2 (D-2) receptor. This dual action may confer additional benefits over selective D-2 antagonists in the treatment of psychotic disorders. In this study, we investigated the occupancy of EMD 128 130 in vivo at the human D-2 and 5-HT1A receptors with positron emission tomography using the radiotracers [C-11]raclopride and [C-11]WAY-100635. Seven healthy volunteers were examined before and after 5 days of treatment with EMD 128 130, administered in an incremental dose building up to 50 mg, b.d. A significant occupancy was demonstrated at the human D-2 receptor (40% following a dose of 50 mg, b.d.) while there was no consistent effect observed at the 5-HT1A receptor, despite a similar affinity of EMD 128 130 for cloned human D-2 and 5-HT1A receptors, and the presence of typical, central 5-HT1A agonist side-effects. The differential effects of EMD 128 130 at the D-2 and the 5-HT1A receptor (antagonist at D-2 receptor, agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor) may explain the differences in occupancy observed.

Since no significant alteration of c-myb expression was found in Abelson murine leukemia virus-induced pre-B-lymphomas harboring a provirus inserted within the Ahi-1 locus, this suggested that it harbors another gene whose dysregulation is involved in tumor formation. Here we report the identification of a novel gene (Ahi-1) targeted by these provirus insertional mutations and the cloning of its cDNA. The Ahi-1 proviral insertions were found at the 3' end of the gene, in an inverse transcriptional orientation, with most of them located around and downstream of the last exon, whereas another insertion was within intron 22. In addition, another previously identified provirus insertion site, Mis-2, was found to map within the 16th intron of the Ahi-1 gene. The Ahi-1 cDNA encodes a 1,047-amino-acid protein. The predicted Ahi-1 protein is a modular protein that contains one SH3 motif and seven WD40 repeats. The Ahi-1 gene is conserved in mammals and encodes two major RNA species of 5 and 4.2 kb and several other shorter splicing variants. The Ahi-1 gene is expressed in mouse embryos and in several organs of the mouse and rat, notably at high levels in the brain and testes. In tumor cells harboring insertional mutations in Ahi-1, truncated Ahi-1/viral fused transcripts were identified, including some splicing variants with deletion of the SH3 domain. Therefore, Ahi-1 is a novel gene targeted by provirus insertion and encoding a protein that exhibits several features of a signaling molecule. Thus, Ahi-1 may play an important role in signal transduction in normal cells and may be involved in tumor development, possibly in cooperation with other oncogenes (such as v-abl and c-myc) or with a tumor suppressor gene (Nfl), since Ahi-1 insertion sites were identified in tumors harboring v-abl defective retroviruses or a c-myc transgene or in tumors exhibiting deletion of Nfl.

Mild MTHFR deficiency, due to a common variant at nucleotide 677, has been reported to alter risk for several disorders including cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects, pregnancy complications, and certain cancers. Little is known about MTHFR regulation, since the complete cDNA and gene sequences have not been determined. In earlier work, we isolated and expressed a 2.2-kb human cDNA comprised of 11 coding exons, and we demonstrated that it encoded an active 70-kDa isoform. However, transcript sizes of approximately 7.5 kb and 9.5 kb and the presence of a second isoform of 77 kDa on Western blots suggested that cDNA sequences were incomplete. In this report, we characterized the complete cDNA and gene structure in human and mouse. Variable 5' and 3' UTR regions were identified, resulting in transcript heterogeneity. The 5' and 3' termini of the MTHFR cDNA were found to overlap with the 5' terminus of a chloride ion channel gene (CLCN-6) and the 3' terminus of an unidentified gene, respectively; this finding has resulted in finer mapping of MTHFR on Chromosome (Chr) 1p36.3. Ribonuclease protection assays identified clusters of transcriptional start sites, suggesting the existence of multiple promoters. MTHFR has several polyadenylation sites creating 3'UTR lengths of 0.2 kb-5.0 kb or 0.6 kb-4.0 kb in human and mouse, respectively. In both species, the previously reported exon 1 was redefined to approximately 3.0 kb in length and shown to be alternatively spliced. An important splice variant contains novel coding sequences; this cDNA was expressed and shown to encode the isozyme of 77 kDa. Our results, which suggest intricate regulation of MTHFR, will facilitate additional regulatory and functional studies of the different isoforms.

Previously, NRAGE over-expression was shown to mediate cell cycle arrest and facilitate nerve growth factor(NGF) dependent apoptosis of sympathetic neuroblasts in a p75(NTR) specific manner. Here we have examined the temporal and spatial expression patterns of NRAGE over the course of murine embryogenesis to determine whether NRAGE's expression is consistent with its proposed functions. We demonstrate that NRAGE mRNA and protein are expressed throughout embryonic and adult tissues. The mRNA is constitutively expressed within each tissue across development. However, expression of NRAGE protein displays a tight temporal tissue specific regulation. During early CNS development, NRAGE protein is expressed throughout the neural tube, but by later stages of neurogenesis, NRAGE protein is restricted within the ventricular zone, subplate and cortical plate. Moreover, NRAGE protein expression is limited to proliferative neural subpopulations as we fail to detect NRAGE expression co-localized with mature/differentiation associated neuronal markers. Interestingly, NRAGE's expression is not restricted solely to areas of p75Nn expression suggesting that NRAGE may mediate proliferation and/or apoptosis from other environmental signals in addition to NGF within the CNS. Our data support previously characterized roles for NRAGE as a mediator of precursor apoptosis and a repressor of cell cycle progression in neural development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The survival of motor neuron (SMN) gene codes for a protein involved in the biogenesis of certain RNPs. Here, we report that SMN is a telomerase-associated protein. Using in vitro binding assays and immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate an association between SMN and the telomerase RNP in vitro and in human cells. The specific immunopurification of SMN from human 293 cells copurified telomerase activity, suggesting that SMN associates with a subset of the functional telomerase holoenzyme. Our results also indicate that the human telomerase RNA and the human (h) TERT are not associated with Sm proteins, in contrast to Saccharomyces ccrevisiae telomerase. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that hTERT does not specifically colocalize with wild-type SMN in gems or Cajal bodies. However, a dominant-negative mutant of SMN (SMNDeltaN27) previously characterized to elicit the cellular reorganization of small nuclear RNPs caused the accumulation of hTERT in specific SMNDeltaN27-induced cellular bodies. Furthermore, coexpression of SMNDeltaN27 and hTERT in rabbit reticulocyte lysates decreased the efficiency of human telomerase reconstitution in vitro. Our results establish SMN as a novel telomerase-associated protein that is likely to function in human telomerase biogenesis.

In a unique patient lacking large myelinated afferents, we found that activation of C tactile (CT) afferents produced a faint sensation of pleasant touch. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis during CT stimulation showed activation of the insular region, but not of somatosensory areas S1 and S2. These findings identify CT as a system for limbic touch that may underlie emotional, hormonal and affiliative responses to caress-like, skin-to-skin contact between individuals.

NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CORTICAL-NEURONS; SPATIAL LOCALIZATION; PARIETAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; NEARBY SOURCES; HUMAN BRAIN; LOCATION; MOVEMENT; AREAS; ATTENTION	We examine the functional characteristics of auditory cortical areas that are sensitive to spatial cues in the human brain, and determine whether they can be dissociated from parietal lobe mechanisms. Three positron emission tomography (PET) experiments were conducted using a speaker array permitting quasi free-field sound presentation within the scanner. Posterior auditory cortex responded to sounds that varied in their spatial distribution, but only when multiple complex stimuli were presented simultaneously, implicating this cortical system in disambiguation of overlapping auditory sources. We also found that the right inferior parietal cortex is specifically recruited in localization tasks, and that its activity predicts behavioral performance, consistent with its involvement in sensorimotor integration and spatial transformation. These findings clarify the functional roles of posterior auditory and parietal cortices, and help to reconcile competing models of auditory cortical organization.

In the present study, we investigated the time course of this effect of ethanol on VTA neurons from young rats. For 70% of the neurons in which ethanol reduced glycine-evoked currents, this depressant effect gradually diminished during continuous superfusion with ethanol. Its action decayed faster when ethanol was applied in several brief pulses than by continuous superfusion. On the other hand, the decay was especially slower when ethanol was applied in pulses at longer intervals or by preincubation. Phorbol ester 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu, 1 muM), an activator of PKC, also depressed glycine-induced currents. In similar to40% (6/15) of the neurons, the effect of PDBu diminished with time and was antagonized by the specific PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine (7 muM). Chelerythrine also attenuated the ethanol-induced depression of glycine-induced currents and its time-dependent decay, thus confirming our previous evidence that PKC mediates, at least in part, the decay of the depressant effect of ethanol on glycine-induced currents of VTA neurons.

WKHA are normotensive and show some features of hyperactivity and of hyper-reactivity to stress, but their utility as model of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has not yet been settled. To address these questions, we performed behavioral and neurochemical evaluations of WKHA, and compared them to both WKY and Wistar (WIS) rats. In locomotor activity tests, the respective scores for each strain were WKY <WKHA <WIS. The relative amplitudes of the inhibition of the startle response by preexposure of the animals to a low-level acoustic cue (prepulse inhibition (PPI) stimulus filtering test) were WKY< WKHA = WIS. In nontreated rats, prepulse inhibition was significantly lower in WKY than in WIS and WKHA rats at low prepulse intensity. Methylphenidate did not decrease locomotor activity in any of the strains, but rather increased locomotion, with the effect being of higher amplitude in WKY. Methylphenidate also impaired prepulse inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. In situ hybridization for NGFI-B, a transcription factor related to the dopaminergic system, revealed that methylphenidate increased the expression of NGFI-B mRNA in the accumbens (core/shell) and striatum only in WKY rats. We conclude that: (1) the behavioral differences between WKY and WKHA can be more readily explained by deficits present in WKY than by unusual characteristics of WKHA, (2) the WKHA does not appear to represent a useful model of ADHD, and (3) the use of WKY rats as the only control for behavioral studies is potentially misleading, because they show a combination of behavioral and neurochemical (dopamine-related) characteristics that make them very different from other common rat strains. Although these characteristics may make them interesting models in their own right, it also follows that the conclusions of any study based on comparisons of one particular strain to just WKY should be interpreted very cautiously.

Furthermore, both stress and alcohol influence the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, Thus, the present studies investigated the response of the HPA axis to stress and the effect of ethanol on the stress response, in subjects at high (HR) and low (LR) risk of alcoholism as determined from their family history. Twenty HR and 20 LR subjects performed a stress-inducing task 30 min following the ingestion of either a placebo drink or a low dose of ethanol. The levels of plasma adrenal corticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol were measured prior to and for four hours following initiation of the treatment. Changes with time in the plasma hormone levels following ingestion of either a placebo or an ethanol drink, without the performance of the stress task, served as controls to compare the stress-induced changes. Neither the placebo nor the ethanol drink altered the plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations. High risk subjects presented lower basal ACTH, but not cortisol, levels and a lower stress-induced increase in plasma ACTH concentration than LR subjects. Furthermore, the HR subjects presented a delayed post-stress recovery of the plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Ethanol consumption prior to the stress task attenuated (ACTH) or abolished (cortisol) the stress-induced increase in the plasma hormone concentrations of both LR and HR subjects. Thus, there are quantitative differences on the response of the HPA-axis to stress between HR and LR subjects, while ingestion of low amounts of ethanol prior to the performance of the stress task had a similar effect on HR and LR individuals.

We performed a 20-year retrospective chart review of 25 patients with clinically proven NF1 who required surgery (group A) and contrasted this cohort with 150 NF1 patients who did not require surgery (group B). In group A, 52% of patients underwent multiple procedures for more than one lesion (p = 0.043). Group A patients were further distinguished from those in group B by exhibiting a greater number of optic gliomas (p = 0.015), nonoptic intracranial tumors (p = 0.006), cranial nerve (p = 0.000), paraspinal (p = 0.0062), craniofacial (p = 0.001) and visceral (p = 0.03) neurofibromas and moyamoya disease (p = 0.00), as well as a higher frequency of seizure disorder, sphenoid wing dysplasia and poor academic performance. Gadolinium enhancement occurred in 43% of optic gliomas, 50% of parenchymal gliomas, 100% of cranial nerve, 100% of plexus, 67% of paraspinal, 50% of craniofacial and 50% of visceral neurofibromas in group A, while only 1 group B tumor enhanced. In group A, radiological progression occurred after a median of 4 years from initial diagnosis for optic gliomas as well as cranial nerve, plexus and visceral neurofibromas, 2 years for paraspinal neurofibromas and brainstem gliomas and 2.7 years for craniofacial neurofibromas. Only 1 tumor progressed in group B. Therefore, a small subgroup of NF1 patients (12.5%) who require treatment are at risk of subsequently needing further surgical attention, whereas a larger group of NF1 patients (87.5%) carry an indolent form of the disease. We recommend imaging for asymptomatic, gadolinium-enhancing lesions every 2 years for optic pathway and parenchymal gliomas and cranial nerve and visceral neurofibromas, and every year for brainstem gliomas and paraspinal as well as craniofacial neurofibromas. Nonenhancing optic pathway lesions could be followed up radiographically much less often since they do not show progression. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

To determine the efficacy of sucrose analgesia for procedural pain during the first week of life in preterm neonates in neonatal intensive care units on enhancing later clinical outcomes. Methods. A total of 107 preterm neonates who were born at <31 weeks' postconceptional age (PCA) entered this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial within 48 hours of birth at 3 level III university-affiliated neonatal intensive care units in Canada, and 103 completed the study. Sucrose (0.1 mL of 24%) or sterile water was administered orally up to 3 times, 2 minutes apart, for every invasive procedure during a 7-day period. Motor development and vigor, and alertness and orientation components of the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant were measured at 32, 36, and 40 weeks' PCA; Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology was measured on the last day of intervention; and Neuro-Biological Risk Score (NBRS) was measured at 2 weeks of age and at discharge. Primary analyses of covariance were applied for each outcome to compare group differences followed by secondary analyses using standard linear regression within each group to determine predictors of outcomes. Results. Although there were no differences between the groups on any outcomes, there were significant dose-related effects within each group. In the sucrose group only, higher number of doses of sucrose predicted lower scores on motor development and vigor, and alertness and orientation at 36 weeks', lower motor development and vigor at 40 weeks', and higher NBRS at 2 weeks' postnatal age. Higher number of invasive procedures was predictive of higher NBRS both times in the water group. Conclusions. Repeated use of sucrose analgesia in infants <31 weeks' PCA may put infants at risk for poorer neurobehavioral development and physiologic outcomes. Additional study is needed to determine the most appropriate age and duration of sucrose analgesia in preterm infants.

Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have been implicated in dorsal horn neuronal nociceptive responses and pain associated with short-term inflammation. The goal of the present study was to assess the role of mGluR(1) in the hyperalgesia and allodynia associated with the CIA model of chronic inflammation. Here we show that antisense (AS) oligonucleotide knockdown of spinal mGluR(1) attenuates thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in rats injected with CFA in one hindpaw. When intrathecal infusion of mGluR(1) AS oligonucleotide (50 mug/day) began prior to CFA injection, mechanical allodynia was attenuated from Days I to 8 following CFA injection, whereas heat hyperalgesia was attenuated on Day I and then from Days 4 to 8. When intrathecal infusion of mGluR(1) AS oligonucleotide was begun 2 days after CFA injection, both mechanical allodynia and beat hyperalgesia were attenuated at all time points following the oligonucleotide infusion. Thus, the present data suggest a role for mGluR(1) in persistent inflammatory nociception. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Mechanical and cold sensitivity was assessed prior to surgery (baseline) and then at 4, 8 and 12 days following CCI. Pretreatment with all of the mGluR agents produced reductions in the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, all the mGluR agents, except MPEP, were effective in reducing the development of cold hypersensitivity. This study demonstrates that spinal Group I mGluR antagonism, and Group 11 or III mGluR agonism, can effectively decrease the development of mechanical and cold hypersensitivity associated with CCI in rats. In addition, the results can be interpreted to suggest that activation of spinal Group I mGluRs contributes to spinal plasticity leading to the development of neuropathic pain, and that this effect is offset by activation of groups 11 and III mGluRs.

The patients have sensorimotor dysfunctions caused by degeneration of spinocerebellar, corticospinal, and lemniscal pathways. Neuropsychologic evaluation indicates slowing of information processing speed and visuospatial deficits in the absence of dementia, aphasia, agnosia, apraxia, and neuropsychiatric signs. These deficits are probably caused by metabolic alterations in regions connected to the cerebellum as a secondary consequence of cerebellar atrophy.

A retrospective study of standing imbalance and body posture in 71 able-bodied girls and subjects with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was conducted. Objective. To test the hypothesis that postural parameters are related to standing stability parameters. Summary of Background Data. Spinal deformity not only modifies the shape of the trunk, but also changes the relations between body segments affecting posture in scoliotic children. These postural adaptations to the scoliotic curve progression could be linked in part to increased body sway in upright standing. This has not yet been related to specific postural parameters involving the head, trunk, and pelvis in nontreated idiopathic scoliosis. Methods. The head, trunk, and pelvis orientations of each subject were measured by a Flock of Bird system. An AMTI force platform was used to assess quiet standing stability an to monitor the position and displacement of the center of pressure (COP). The center of mass (COM) excursion was estimated from a biomechanical model using force plate information only. Analyses of variance (ANO-VAS) were performed to determine the statistical differences between the scoliotic and nonscoliotic subjects, and backward stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed to identify any correlation between measures of quiet standing stability and body postural parameters. Results. The scoliotic group was characterized by a decrease in standing ability. There was an increase in the sway areas measured by the variations of the COP and COM. From the backward stepwise multiple regression analysis, it appears that for the able-bodied girls, the body posture parameters were correlated only with the mean anteroposterior center of pressure (COPAP) position. For the scoliotic group, the sway areas and the mean position of the centers of pressure and the COPAP-COMAP were correlated significantly with body posture parameters. The higher COP-COM differences for the scoliotic group were attributed to a greater neuromuscular demand to maintain standing balance. The coefficients of correlation of the multiple regression analyses ranged from 0.64 to 0.85 for the nonscoliotic group and form 0.55 to 0.72 for the scoliotic group. Conclusions. The use of backward stepwise multiple correlations highlighted the interaction between several body parameters and their relation to standing stability in both able-bodied girls and scoliotic subjects. The scoliotic group displayed a much larger number of correlations than the nonscoliotic group. Standing imbalance was related to altered body posture parameters measured in the frontal and horizontal planes only. Although the correlation coefficients were relatively high, factors other than body posture parameters appeared related to standing imbalance in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. These findings support the concept of either a primary or a secondary dysfunction in the postural regulation system if scoliotic subjects.

It has been suggested that the combustion products of MMT containing Mn, such as manganese phosphate, could cause neurological symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease in humans. The aim of this work was to investigate the exposure-response relationship of bioaccumulation, neuropathology, and neurobehavior following a subchronic inhalation exposure to manganese phosphate in Sprague-Dawley male rats. Rats were exposed 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 13 consecutive weeks at 30, 300, or 3000 mug/m(3) Mn phosphate and compared to controls. Some rats were implanted with chronic EMG electrodes in the gastrocnemius muscle of the hind limb to assess tremor at the end of Mn exposure. Spontaneous motor activity was measured for 36 h using a computerized auto-track system. Rats were then sacrificed by exsanguination and Mn level in different brain tissues and other organs was determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Neuronal cell counts were obtained by assessing the sum of five grid areas for the caudate/putamen and the sum of two adjacent areas for the globus pallidus. Increased manganese concentrations were observed in all tissues of the brain and was dose-dependent in olfactory bulb and caudate/putamen. In fact, beginning with the highest level of exposure (3000 mug/m) and ending with the control group, Mn concentrations in the olfactory bulb were 2.47 vs 1.28 vs 0.77 vs 0.64 ppm (P < 0.05) while for the caudate/putamen, Mn concentrations were 1.06 vs 0.73 vs 0.62 vs 0.47 ppm (P < 0.05). The Mn concentrations in lung were also dose-dependent (10.30 vs 1.40 vs 0.42 vs 0.17 ppm; P < 0.05). No statistical difference was observed for loss of neurons in caudate/putamen and globus pallidus. Locomotor activity assessment and tremor assessment did not reveal in neurobehavioral changes between the groups. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the olfactory bulb and caudate/putamen are the main brain tissues for Mn accumulation after subchronic inhalation exposure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Strabismic amblyopes, but not anisometropic amblyopes, failed to show the reduction in perceived contrast typical of normal vision [J. Opt. Soc. Amer. A 15 (1998) 1733] when lateral contrast information is available at the same orientation and spatial frequency. The strabismic amblyopes also severely misperceive the regularity of the array of Gabors flanking the test stimulus. A normal eye could model the anomalous contrast perception of the amblyopic eye, by adding an equivalent amount of spatial distortion to the stimulus. The relationship between the observed anomalies for local contrast gain control and positional sensitivity is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Noninvasive approaches, meticulous chronic instrumentation for the recording of multiple respiratory indices, and correlations with brain studies performed after physiological manipulations in vivo can all be employed to get to some understanding of the maturation of respiratory control in the mammal. This article is a selective and critical overview of recent literature on methodologies that can be used in behaving subjects, the relationship of respiration to sleep-wake states, respiratory patterns during normoxia, and on respiratory responsiveness to hypercarbia and hypoxia, all emphasizing processes during development. It is hoped that this review will encourage new investigators interested in the regulation of breathing to resort to experimental approaches that will reveal the mysteries of respiratory behavior in the integrated organism.

Faster phonetic learners appeared to have more white matter in parietal regions, especially in the left hemisphere. The pattern of results was similar for the rapidly changing but not for the steady-state nonlinguistic stimuli, suggesting that morphological correlates of phonetic learning are related to the ability to process rapid temporal variation. Greater asymmetry in the amount of white matter in faster learners may be related to greater myelination allowing more efficient neural processing, which is critical for the ability to process certain speech sounds.

Background: The reported occurrence of RBD in PD varies from 15 to 47%. However, no study has estimated the frequency of RBD using PSG recordings or analyzed in detail the characteristics of REM sleep muscle atonia in a large group of unselected patients with PD. Methods: Consecutive patients with PD (n = 33) and healthy control subjects (n = 16) were studied. Each subject underwent a structured clinical interview and PSG recording. REM sleep was scored using a method that allows the scoring of REM sleep without atonia. Results: One third of patients with PD met the diagnostic criteria of RBD based on PSG recordings. Only one half of these cases would have been detected by history. Nineteen (58%) of 33 patients with PD but only 1 of 16 control subjects had REM sleep without atonia. Of these 19 patients with PD, 8 (42%) did not present with behavioral manifestations of RBD, and their cases may represent preclinical forms of RBD associated with PD. Moreover, the percentage of time spent with muscle atonia during REM sleep was lower among patients with PD than among healthy control subjects (60.1% vs 93.2%; p = 0.003). Conclusions: RBD and REM sleep without atonia are frequent in PD as shown by PSG recordings.

BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						self-stimulation; obesity; energy balance; reinforcement; feeding; perifornical area	HYPOTHALAMIC SELF-STIMULATION; OBESE GENE-PRODUCT; BODY-WEIGHT; OB/OB MICE; LEPTIN; RATS; EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR; BEHAVIOR; HORMONE	The rewarding effect produced by electrically stimulating particular sites in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) can be enhanced by chronic food restriction and body weight loss, The impact on brain stimulation reward (BSR) of certain hormones involved in the regulation of energy balance, such as leptin and corticotropin-releasing hormone, depends upon the sensitivity of BSR to food restriction. The present investigation assessed the influence of neuropeptide Y (NPY), a potent orexigenic peptide. on BSR generated by stimulating restriction-sensitive and -insensitive sites in the LH, Twelve male Long Evans rats were trained to press a lever for a rewarding train of stimulation. Rate-frequency curves, reflecting the number of rewards earned as a function of the stimulation frequency, were collected during free-feeding and then again following a period of food restriction and 20-25% body weight loss. NPY (4 mug) was administered intraventriculary during the food restriction condition. Alterations in the rewarding effect of the stimulation were assessed by measuring changes in the frequency required to maintain half-maximal rewards earned (M-50). In half of the subjects, food restriction produced significant decreases in M-50 values, indicating that the reward effectiveness of the stimulation was potentiated. In contrast, M-50 values were unaltered by food restriction in the remaining six animals. In most of the subjects in which M-50 values decreased following chronic food restriction, NPY failed to alter BSR. Similarly, BSR was unchanged by NPY administration in most of the rats with restrict ion-insensitive Stimulation sites. These findings suggest that NPY does not take part in the process whereby food restriction and leptin modulate reward circuitry activated by stimulating restriction-sensitive sites.

Neurofilaments play a critical role in the development of axonal diameter; however, their role in the development of dendrites is largely unknown. By overexpressing different neurofilament subunits, we previously demonstrated that alteration of neurofilament subunit composition resulted in dramatic changes in dendritic arborization. To further determine the role of neurofilaments in dendritic growth, we examined and compared the dendritic architecture of spinal cord neurons in young NF-L knockout (-/-), heterozygous (+/-), and wild-type (+/+) mice. We show that an absence or reduction in the expression of NF-L inhibited dendritic growth most dramatically in large motoneurons, mildly in medium neurons, but had no effect on small neurons. We also reveal that a decrease in NF-L leads to an increase in NF-M and NF-H subunits in cell bodies and their reduction in dendrites. These results demonstrate that NF-L is a critical intrinsic factor for dendritic growth in large motoneurons.

Here, we report that brain injuries can trigger expression of peripherin and the formation of peripherin accumulations in neurons that are normally silent for this gene. Stab lesions made with nitrocellulose implants induced within 4 days the formation of peripherin accumulations, devoid of neurofilament proteins, in thalamic neurites at the site of the lesion. The local administration of interleukin-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor at the site of the stab lesion extended the expression pattern of peripherin to other neuronal subsets in areas of the cortex and/or of the hippocampus adjacent to injury. We also show that transient focal ischemia in mice, a model of stroke, can trigger within 72 h the formation of neuronal peripherin accumulations in neurons of the cortex, thalamus and hippocampus. This new type of potentially noxious intermediate filament protein accumulations, composed of peripherin, may be of relevance to many brain degenerative disorders with occurrence of proinflammatory cytokines.

In particular, the BC1 RNA, which is transcribed to high levels specifically in brain and testis from one locus of the ID SINE family, exists as a discrete RNP complex. We expressed a series of altered BC1, and other SINE-related RNAs, in several cell lines and tested for the mobility of the resulting RNP complexes in a native PAGE assay to determine which portions of these SINE RNAs contribute to protein binding. When different SINE RNAs were substituted for the BC1 ID sequence, the resulting RNPs exhibited the same mobility as BC1. This indicates that the protein(s) binding to the ID portion of BC1 is not sequence specific and may be more dependent upon the secondary structure of the RNA. It also suggests that all SINE RNAs may bind a similar set of cellular proteins. Deletion of the A-rich region of BC1 RNA has a marked effect on the mobility of the RNP. Rodent cell lines exhibit a slightly different mobility for this shifted complex when compared to human cell lines, reflecting evolutionary differences in one or more of the protein components. On the basis of mobility change observed in RNP complexes when the A-rich region is removed, we decided to examine poly(A) binding protein (PABP) as a candidate member of the RNP. An antibody against the C terminus of PABP is able to immunoprecipitate BC1 RNA, confirming PABP's presence in the BC1 RNP. Given the ubiquitous role of poly(A) regions in the retrotransposition process, these data suggest that PABP may contribute to the SINE retrotransposition process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We hypothesize that UNG is important in protecting the mid-organogenesis stage [gestational day (GD) 10-12] rat conceptus against conditions that limit thymidine biosynthesis. Transcripts for both UNG isoforms were expressed highly in the yolk sac and embryo, increasing over 400% in the embryo between GD11 and 12. GD10 and 11 yolk sacs showed the highest levels of putatively active UNG2 protein, with little UNG1 protein. Moderate levels of UNG2 and UNG1 proteins were found in the embryo on GDs 10 through 12; no significant increase in either protein occurred on GD 12. UNG activity was higher in yolk sac than embryo on GDs 10 and 11, mirroring protein levels. Exposure to the teratogen methotrexate (MTX) leads to nucleotide pool imbalance, uracil incorporation into DNA, and genotoxic stress-induced cell death. Concentration-dependent decreases in developmental growth parameters, decreased yolk sac vasculature, and malformations such as kinked tail and retarded limb development were observed in embryos exposed to MTX (0.5, 2.5, or 5 muM). UNG transcripts were elevated 30-40% in both yolk sac and embryo after a 6-hr culture with 0.5 muM MTX; however, protein expression and activity were unaffected. Thus, MTX exposure caused malformations but did not modify UNG protein expression or activity, indicating an inability to increase the removal of MTX-induced genotoxic damage. Furthermore, UNG expression was developmental stage- and tissue-specific; the discrepancy between transcript and protein levels suggests post-transcriptional regulation.

Because astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) activity in the midbrain dopaminergic cell body region is required for the development of enduring changes in dopaminergic function induced by stimulant drugs, we investigated the effects of intrauterine anoxia on astrocytic bFGF expression in dopaminergic regions at 2 weeks of age and after a stress manipulation in adults. Methods: We examined bFGF immunoreactivity in dopaminergic regions of young and adult rats born by cesarean section, cesarean section + 15 min of intrauterine anoxia, or vaginally. bFGF immunoreactivity, was also assessed before and after tail-pinch stress in adult animals exposed to the same perinatal interventions. Results: Perinatal anoxia produced persistent decreases in basal bFGF immunoreactivity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but enhanced the effect of stress on VTA bFGF immunoreactivity. Conclusions: Perinatal anoxia has enduring effects on VTA bFGF immunoreactivity and influences adult neuroadaptations to stress. The mechanisms whereby perinatal anoxia alters dopaminergic function may be similar to those responsible for the development of sensitization to stimulant drugs and may involve bFGF.

Here, we report that Stau2 is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that is mainly expressed in the brain. We show that Stau2 is found in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons. In dendrites, Stau2 is aligned on individual tracts and colocalizes with microtubules. Stau2 is expressed as at least three splice isoforms, which can be observed in several subcellular complexes. Although a 62 kDa isoform (Stau2(62)) fractionates in ribosome-free fractions of light density, Stau2(59) and Stau2(52) are found in high-density complexes. These complexes are resistant to EDTA and to non-ionic detergent. For the first time, we also provide evidence for an interaction of some Stau2 isoforms with ribosomes, thus pointing to an interesting new role for Stau2 in translation. EDTA treatment, which dissociates ribosome subunits, does not release Stau2 from the subunits, suggesting that Stau2-ribosome associations are not mediated mainly by mRNA intermediates. Although Stau2 has many features in common with its paralogue Stau1, it does not colocalize with Stau1-containing particles, indicating that these proteins are components of different complexes in dendrites. Our findings suggest that members of the Staufen family share evolutionarily conserved properties and highlight the complexity of Staufen-mediated RNA transport in neurons.

Contrary to mammalian PGI, bacterial PGI was not internalized by the PGI/AMF receptor (gp78/AMF-R) and neither bacterial nor yeast PGI competed with mammalian PGI for receptor binding and internalization. Furthermore, while the bacterial, yeast and mammalian preparations all exhibited isomerase activity, only mammalian PGI stimulated the motility of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. The conserved active site of PGI is therefore not sufficient for receptor binding and cytokine activity of PGI. However, synthetic peptides corresponding to distinct peripheral mammalian PGI sequences did not inhibit internalization of mammalian PGI. Our data therefore argue that the cytokine activity of PGI is specific to mammalian PGI but cannot exclude the possibility that the receptor binding motif of PGI is complex and includes elements within and without the active site.

One typical measure of this neural pathway is the skin conductance response (SCR). This response generally depends upon stimulus arousal, one of the two motivational determinants of emotion. The objective of the present study was to verify whether emotional reactions to music elicit such event-related autonomic responses. To this aim, four musical emotions varying in arousal were employed: fear, happiness, sadness and peacefulness. SCRs were found to be greater with the two more stimulating emotions, fear and happiness, as compared to the two more relaxing emotions, sadness and peacefulness (P<0.05). In addition, subjects' ratings of the emotional clarity for each excerpt did not parallel the corresponding SCRs magnitudes. The results show that SCRs can be evoked and modulated by musical emotional arousal, but are not sensitive to emotional clarity. While several studies have been performed with visual scenes and environmental sounds, the present study brings similar evidence from the musical domain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

In the present study, inactivation of descending fibers by microinjection of muscimol (50 ng) in the rostral ventromedial medulla abolished morphine analgesia in the tail immersion and hot plate tests but decreased morphine analgesia by 60% in the formalin test. Analysis of the dose-response relation for morphine after inactivation of descending fibers revealed that, except for the tail immersion test, high doses of morphine could not overcome the block induced by muscimol. Also, morphine analgesia elicited supraspinally was not detectable when descending fibers were inactivated, suggesting that the analgesic effect of morphine in the brain requires a relay via the rostral ventromedial medulla. The analgesic effect of buprenorphine also depends on the integrity of descending fibers from the rostral ventromedial medulla. The results indicate that descending fibers from the rostral ventromedial medulla are critically important to the analgesic effect of opioids, regardless of the type of noxious stimulation eliciting pain. Residual analgesic effects of opioids after inactivation of descending fibers may be due to peripheral effects in the presence of inflammation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

To evaluate EFs in DAT, a new version of the Tower of London (TOL) task, originally developed by Shallice (1982). was adapted. The now version of the test was built up in its easiest possible feature in order to be administrable to early- or middle-stage demented patients. Seventeen DAT patients, and 17 controls matched for age and sex, were administered the TOL. The protocol followed a "hierarchical paradigm," that is, simpler problems were embedded in more complex, subsequent problems. Results showed that DAT patients were impaired compared to controls. Both control and DAT groups showed a decrease in percentage of success rate in relation to the number of movements required by the task. On the more complex problems, the performance of DAT subjects was proportionally more impaired. Qualitative analysis revealed that rule breaking was a salient performance feature of the DAT group. These findings are consistent with the presence of an EF deficit in DAT. (C) 2002 National Academy of Neuropsychology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The sensitivity of the rewarding effect to restriction predicts the modulation of brain stimulation reward (BSR) by the adiposity hormone, leptin. The present study examined the effect of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) on the rewarding effect of stimulating restriction-sensitive and restriction-insensitive sites. Chronic food restriction reduced frequency thresholds for BSR in half of the subjects but had no effect in the others. CRH increased thresholds only in subjects in which the rewarding effect was insensitive to restriction. In contrast, frequency thresholds remained stable in nearly all rats with restriction-sensitive stimulation sites. These findings provide further evidence that sensitivity to food restriction is an important factor in determining the influence of hormones and neuropeptides on brain reward circuitry.

By using sedimentation analysis on sucrose gradients, we showed that the Staufen isoform with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa (Stau(55)) co-fractionated with ribosomes and associated with both the 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits, suggesting that the Staufen isoform hStau(55) plays some role in translation. To map the determinant(s) involved in this association, we generated a series of deletion mutants and analysed their subcellular distribution by cell fractionation and fluorescent immunomicroscopy. Our results demonstrated that multiple determinants promote hStau(55)-ribosome association via both an RNA-binding-dependent mechanism and protein-protein interaction. The RNA-binding activity of the RNA-binding protein domain 3 (dsRBD3) but not that of dsRBD4 is the first determinant. Although necessary for stable association with ribosomes, dsRBD3 alone is not sufficient and needs other determinants as co-factors. Consistently, when expressed together, dsRBD4 and the tubulin-binding domain constitute the minimal Stau(55)/ribosome protein-protein association domain. This region of Stau(55) is sufficient to associate with ribosomes independently, but requires the RNA-binding activity of dsRBD3 for complete association. Thus the results are consistent with a putative role for Stau(55) in the regulation of translation.

Several 14-3-3 isoforms were recently shown to be cruciform DNA-binding proteins, which is a new activity ascribed to the 14-3-3 family. As cruciform-binding proteins, 14-3-3 proteins are putatively involved in the regulation of DNA replication. Inverted repeat sequences that are able to extrude into cruciform structures are a common feature of replication origins in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The involvement of cruciform structures in the initiation of DNA replication has been demonstrated. A leading model of 14-3-3 function proposes that they facilitate critical protein-protein interactions, thus serving as a central component of a wide variety of cellular processes.

He was followed-up over 10 months at 4-month intervals, with a lateralized lexical decision task (LDT), an attentional task, and a language battery. Testing started when HJ was 2 months poststroke. In the LDT, words were presented to central vision or lateralized to the left or right visual hemifield. At each test period, we examined the effect of the degree of imageability (high vs. low), and the grammatical class (noun vs. verb) of the targets on HJ's response times and error rates, with left visual field, right visual field, and central vision presentations. The results of the experiment showed that the pattern obtained with the LDT could not be accounted for by fluctuations in attention. There was an interaction of grammatical class with degree of imageability with left Visual field displays only. The right hemisphere (RH) was faster with high-imageability words than with low-image-ability words, regardless of their grammatical class. There was also an overall RH advantage on response times at 2 and 6 months after onset. This RH predominance coincided with a major recovery of language comprehension and the observation of semantic paralexias. while no major change in language expression was observed at that point. Ten months after onset, the pattern of lateralization changed, and response times for the LDT with either presentation site were equivalent. This LH improvement coincided with some recovery of language expression at the single-word level. The results of this study suggest that, in cases of severe aphasia caused by extensive LH lesions, the RH may play an important role in the recovery process. Furthermore, these results show that the contribution of the two cerebral hemispheres to recovery may vary overtime and affect specific aspects of language. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Methods: A data collection form was developed to facilitate and standardize the data extraction. Two clinicians extracted information pertaining to 231 variables of the system from 15 charts of persons receiving rehabilitation services following a head injury. Results: Average percentage agreement was high and did not vary from one category of variables to the other (84-88%). Substantial intra-rater agreement (k = 0.66) and moderate inter-rater agreement (k = 0.56) were found to be associated with the extraction of the variables studied. Conclusions: The results suggest that clinicians using standardized procedures can reliably extract important data pertaining to personal history, impairments, and disabilities relating to sensorimotor function. Some potential sources of error are identified and recommendations are presented.

This study aims at characterizing the spinal mechanism of that initial hypotension occurring in awake unrestrained rats. 2 The initial hypotension (-18+/-2.0 mmHg at 1 min) and the tachycardia (110 +/- 10 b.p.m.) produced by the intrathecal (i.t.) injection of the stable NK1 receptor agonist [Sar(9), Met(O-2)(11)]-SP (Sar9, 0.65 nmol) at T-9 spinal cord level was inhibited by the prior injection of 65 nmol LY306740 or LY303870 (NK1 receptor antagonists). No inhibition was seen when a similar dose of antagonists was given intravenously. 3 The prior i.t. injection of the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP52432 (100 nmol) reduced the hypotension evoked by Sar9 (0.65 nmol) and by the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (100 nmol). The GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (25 nmol, i.t.) was without effect against Sar9, and the GABAA agonist muscimol (100 nmol, i.t.) had no cardiovascular effect. 4 The putative involvement of other mediators (dopamine, serotonine, glycine and glutamate) in Sar9-induced hypotension was made unlikely on the basis of various pharmacological treatments. Thus data, suggest that the transient hypotension which occurs upon the activation of NK1 receptors in the spinal cord is due to the release of GABA which in turn activates GABAB receptors to inhibit sympathetic pre-ganglionic fibres. This mechanism may have a physiological significance in the spinal reflex autonomic control of arterial blood pressure.

Method: We administered a self-report questionnaire to 2 10 respondents. For various licit and illicit substances, participants reported their age of first use, number of lifetime uses, and usage in the previous 30 days. Results: We found a significant rank order for the sequence of first use: 1) alcohol, 2) nicotine, 3) cannabis, 4) LSD, 5) psilocybin, 6) amphetamine, 7) cocaine, 8) MDMA, 9) gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), 10) ephedrine, 11) ketamine. Alcohol and cannabis were the most commonly used substances, both in cumulative number of lifetime uses and in usage in the preceding 30 days. MDMA and amphetamine were also notable as the next 2 most popular drugs for use in the preceding 30 days and in terms of those who had tried the drugs at least once. We identified a progressive rank order of experimentation, with early alcohol or cannabis use (or both) associated with the early use of all other drugs tried by more than 25% of the sample. We found MDMA and amphetamine use to be prevalent, as was general experimentation with all drugs studied, other than heroin. Conclusion: Drug consumption levels were substantial in this "rave" population, particularly with respect to recent use of MDMA, amphetamine, cannabis, and alcohol. Results also indicate that the sequence of drug experimentation in this population follows an identifiable pattern.

Controversy surrounds its characterization, implementation, and definition. Mild cognitive impairment is now the focus of natural history studies, biomarker studies, along with Alzheimer's disease prevention studies. The mild cognitive impairment stage may be the optimum stage at which to intervene with preventive therapies. Depending on the cohort source and definition, between 19 and 50% of mild cognitive impairment individuals progress to dementia (usually Alzheimer's disease) over 3 years. Despite controversy, progress has been achieved in defining risk factors for progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. New treatments to prevent development of Alzheimer's disease are targeting mild cognitive impairment as a treatment group and neurologists will increasingly be called upon to make this diagnosis.

A proportion of this projection contains the low-affinity p75 neurotrophic receptor (p75NTR). Neonatal monosodium glutamate (MSG) treatment, which dramatically reduces p75NTR immunoreactivity in the SCN has no impact on photic entrainment. In order to clarify the contribution of p75NTR fibers in,photic entrainment, targeted lesions of the p75NTR-immunoreactive SCN plexus were performed using intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intra. hypothalamic injections of the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin (SAP) in rats. SAP treatment effectively abolished p75NTR immunoreactivity within the SCN core. ICV SAP treatment produced three different behavioral activity patterns: Animals became arrhythmic, displayed a shorter free-running period, or remained rhythmic following the lesion. Arrhythmic animals had large hypothalamic lesion which encompassed the entire SCN. In rhythmic rats, ICV-SAP significantly reduced immunostaining for calbindin-D28k (CaBP) in the SCN, and rats with shortened free-running periods had the lowest number of CaBP immunoreactive cells. ICV SAP also attenuated light-induced Fos expression in the SCN core. Despite lack of p75NTR and reduced CaBP and Fos expression in the SCN, SAP-treated rhythmic rats displayed normal photic entrainment. Intrahypothalamic SAP treatment reduced CaBP expression in the SCN but had no effect on light-induced Fos expression, free-running rhythms, or photic entrainment. The data show that p75NTR-immunoreactive elements in the SCN are not required for photic entrainment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC PATENTS			English	Review						cancer; extracellular matrix; ganglioside; glycolipids; irnmunosuppression; ligand; neurodegeneration; neuroprotection; rafts; vaccine	CELL-PROLIFERATION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; GM(1) GANGLIOSIDE; GD3 GANGLIOSIDE; GM1 GANGLIOSIDE; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; IN-VIVO; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; APOPTOSIS	A wide array of pathologies make gangliosides interesting molecules either as therapeutic targets or as possible therapeutic agents. This review covers recent patents and ongoing research focusing on the use of gangliosides as drugs and drug targets for indications such as cancer, neurodegeneration, viral and bacterial infections and immunosuppression. A major deficit of gangliosides as therapeutics is that they are ubiquitous cell membrane components whose cognate functions remain puzzling. Understanding the cognate biology of gangliosides and the nature of the molecules that interact with gangliosides will undoubtedly unlock novel approaches for making use of these interesting glycolipids for therapeutic intervention.

The limited resolution of PET leads to "tissue-fraction" effects, reflecting underlying tissue heterogeneity, and "spillover" effects between regions, Addressing the former problem in general requires supplementary data, for example. coregistered high-resolution magnetic resonance images, whereas the latter effect can be corrected for with PET data alone if the point-spread function of the tomograph has been characterized. Analysis of otherwise homogeneous region-of-interest data ideally requires a combination Of tissue classification and correction for the point-spread function. The formulation of appropriate algorithms for partial volume correction (PVC) is dependent on both the distribution of the signal and the distribution of the underlying noise. A mathematical framework has therefore been developed to accommodate both of these factors and to facilitate the development of new PVC algorithms based on the description of the problem. Several methodologies and algorithms have been proposed and implemented in the literature in order to address these problems. These methods do not, however, explicitly consider the noise model while differing in their underlying assumptions. The general theory for estimation of regional concentrations, associated error estimation, and inhomogeneity tests are presented in a weighted least squares framework. The analysis has been validated using both simulated and real PET data sets. The relations between the current algorithms and those published previously are formulated and compared. The incorporation of tensors into the formulation of the problem has led to the construction of computationally rapid algorithms taking into account both tissue-fraction and spillover effects. The suitability of their application to dynamic and static images is discussed.

Here, we measured whether memory performance in two groups of elderly humans separated on the basis of their cortisol history over a 5-yr period could be modulated by a hormone-replacement protocol in which we inhibited cortisol secretion by the administration of metyrapone and then restored baseline cortisol levels by infusion of hydrocortisone. We showed that in elderly subjects with a 5-yr history of moderate cortisol levels (n = 8), metyrapone treatment significantly impaired memory performance, a deficit that was reversed following hydrocortisone replacement. In the elderly subjects with a 5-yr history of high cortisol levels and current memory deficits (n = 9), metyrapone treatment did not have any significant effect on memory performance, but hydrocortisone treatment significantly decreased delayed memory. These results suggest that memory function in elderly humans can be intensely modulated by pharmacological manipulation of glucocorticoids, although the direction of these effects depends on the cortisol history of each individual.

Previously, we have described changes in brain activity associated with hypnosis (Rainville, Hofbauer, Paus, Duncan, Bushnell, & Price, 1999). Here, we replicate and extend those findings using positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 normal volunteers. Immediately after each of 8 PET scans performed before (4 scans) and after (4 scans) the induction of hypnosis, subjects rated their perceived level of "mental relaxation'' and "mental absorption,'' two of the key dimensions describing the experience of being hypnotized. Regression analyses between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and self-ratings confirm the hypothesized involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the thalamus, and the ponto-mesencephalic brainstem in the production of hypnotic states. Hypnotic relaxation further involved an increase in occipital rCBF that is consistent with our previous interpretation that hypnotic states are characterized by a decrease in cortical arousal and a reduction in cross-modality suppression (disinhibition). In contrast, increases in mental absorption during hypnosis were associated with rCBF increases in a distributed network of cortical and subcortical structures previously described as the brain's attentional system. These findings are discussed in support of a state theory of hypnosis in which the basic changes in phenomenal experience produced by hypnotic induction reflect, at least in part, the modulation of activity within brain areas critically involved in the regulation of consciousness.

He presents with pure and severe dyslexia and average to high-average cognitive skills, which are usually in the low-average range in patients with developmental dyslexia. A highly circumscribed deficit of rote auditory verbal memory was the only deficit other than the dyslexia; his verbal semantic memory and visuospatial memory were intact. Two previously reported cases present a similar functional profile and lesion locus. This profile indicates that there may exist, at birth, a localized neural network dedicated to "reading acquisition" and that the layout of this network may differ from the systems identified as defective in developmental dyslexia, as well as in cases of acquired dyslexia in adults.

A novel AR N-terminal-interacting protein (ARNIP) was isolated using the yeast two-hybrid system and its interaction with amino acids 11-172 of the normal or corresponding region of the polyglutamine-expanded human AR confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. ARNIP cDNAs cloned from NSC-34 (mouse neuroblastoma/spinal cord) or PC-3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma) mRNA encoded highly homologous 30 kDa (261 amino acids) cysteine-rich proteins with a RING-H-2 (C3H2C3 zinc finger) domain; this motif is highly conserved in predicted ARNIP-homologous proteins from several other species. Expression of the similar to1.7 kb ARNIP mRNA was detected in various tissues by Northern blotting, but was highest in mouse testes, kidney and several neuronal cell lines. In addition, the human ARNIP protein was found to be encoded by nine exons spanning 32 kb on chromosome 4q21. In COS-1 cells, coexpression of ARNIP and AR did not affect AR ligand-binding kinetics, nor did ARNIP act as a coactivator or corepressor in transactivation assays. However, AR N-terminal:C-terminal interaction was reduced in the presence of ARNIP. Intriguingly, ARNIP, and in particular its RING-H2 domain, functioned as a ubiquitin-protein ligase in vitro in the presence of a specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc4-1. Mutation of a single cysteine residue in the ARNIP RING-H2 domain (Cys145Ala) abolished this E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Fluorescent protein tagging studies revealed that AR-ARNIP interaction was hormone-independent in COS-1 cells, and suggest that colocalization of both AR and ARNIP to the nucleus upon androgen addition may allow ARNIP to play a role in nuclear processes. Thus, identification of a novel AR-interacting protein with ubiquitin ligase activity will stimulate further investigation into the role of ubiquitination and the ubiquitin-proteasome system in AR-mediated cellular functions.

Because estradiol (E-2) arises mainly from the conversion of T in men, the availability of E-2 also decreases with increasing age. In randomized clinical trials, E-2 replacement therapy has been shown to maintain aspects of cognition in postmenopausal women, specifically with regard to verbal memory. The present prospective, randomized, cross-over trial is being undertaken in order to determine whether E-2 will enhance verbal memory in men with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Men with MCI will randomly receive E-2 or placebo for the first 3 mo of treatment and will then be crossed-over to the other treatment for an additional 3 mo. A battery of neuropsychological tests will be administered at pretreatment and, again, following each 3-mo treatment phase. It is hypothesized that elderly men with MCI will perform better on tests of explicit memory when they are being treated with E-2 compared to their performance under placebo conditions.

To gain insight into the role of prohormone convertases PC1, PC2, and PC7 in this process, we investigated the maturation of pro-NT/NN in the brain of PC7 (PC7-/-), PC2 (PC2-/-), and/or PC1 (PC1+/- and PC2-/-; PC1+/-) knock down mice. Inactivation of the PC7 gene was without effect, suggesting that this convertase is not involved in the processing of pro-NT/NN. By contrast, there was a 15% decrease in NT and a 50% decrease in NN levels, as measured by radioimmunoassay, in whole brain extracts from PC2 null as compared with wild type mice. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that this decrease in pro-NT/NN maturation products was uneven and that it was most pronounced in the medial preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. These results suggest that PC2 plays a critical role in the processing of pro-NT/NN in mouse brain and that its deficiency may be compensated to a regionally variable extent by other convertases. Previous data have suggested that PC1 might be subserving this role. However, there was no change in the maturation of pro-NT/NN in the brain of mice in which the PC1 gene had been partially inactivated, implying that complete PC1 knock down may be required for loss of function.

In the present study we found that variations in maternal licking/grooming (LG) during the first week of life are associated with altered hippocampal expression of BAX (group-1 tumor necrosis factor family mediated cell death effector) in 90-day-old male offspring. BAX-like immunoreactivity on western blots is significantly increased in the adult offspring of low-level LG mothers. There is no effect of maternal care on levels of either B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) (group-II mitochondria mediated cell death suppressor) or BAD (group-III endoplasmic reticulum mediated cell death effector). The most striking biochemical event in apoptosis is DNA fragmentation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transerferase (Tdt)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) staining showed that the number of TUNEL-positive cells in both the dentate gyrus and CA1 region of the hippocampus is significantly increased in the adult offspring of low-level LG mothers. In conclusion, we propose that hippocampal neurons in the offspring of low-level LG mothers may be more vulnerable to loss through apoptosis.

We looked for gaze-related modulation in PMd during the brief fixations that occur when a monkey is allowed to look around freely without experimentally imposed gaze control while performing a center-out delayed arm-reaching task. During the course of the instructed-delay period, we found significant effects of gaze angle in 27-51% of PMd cells. However, for 90-95% of cells, these effects accounted for <20% of the observed discharge variance. The effect of gaze was significantly weaker than the effect of reach-related variables. In particular, cell activity during the delay period was more strongly related to the intended movement expressed in arm-related coordinates than in gaze-related coordinates. Under the same experimental conditions, many cells in medial parietal cortex exhibited much stronger gaze-related modulation and expressed intended movement in gaze-related coordinates. In summary, gaze direction-related modulation of cell activity is indeed expressed in PMd during the brief fixations that occur in natural oculomotor behavior, but its overall effect on cell activity is modest.

Furthermore, treatment either with C3 transferase (C3) to inactivate Rho or with Y27632 to inhibit ROK was sufficient to stimulate axon regeneration and recovery of hindlimb function after spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult mice. Injured mice were treated with a single injection of Rho or Rho-associated kinase inhibitors delivered in protein adhesive at the lesion site. Treated animals showed long-distance regeneration of anterogradely labeled corticospinal axons and increased levels of GAP-43 mRNA in the motor cortex. Behaviorally, inactivation of Rho pathway induced rapid recovery of locomotion and progressive recuperation of forelimb-hindlimb coordination. These findings provide evidence that the Rho signaling pathway is a potential target for therapeutic interventions after spinal cord injury.

We have previously reported that a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is expressed in the mammalian CNS. To better understand the role of ceruloplasmin in iron homeostasis in the CNS, we generated a ceruloplasmin gene-deficient (Cp-/-) mouse. Adult Cp-/- mice showed increased iron deposition in several regions of the CNS such as the cerebellum and brainstem. Increased lipid peroxidation was also seen in some CNS regions. Cerebellar cells from neonatal Cp-/- mice were also more susceptible to oxidative stress in vitro. Cp-/- mice showed deficits in motor coordination that were associated with a loss of brainstem dopaminergic neurons. These results indicate that ceruloplasmin plays an important role in maintaining iron homeostasis in the CNS and in protecting the CNS from iron-mediated free radical injury. Therefore, the antioxidant effects of ceruloplasmin could have important implications for various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in which iron deposition is known to occur.

The goal of this study was to establish a reliable method for identification of face and tongue sensory function in the lower central area. Methods. All positron emission tomography (PET) clinical activation studies performed over a 3-year period at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital were evaluated by coresistering the PET images with three-dimensional reconstructions of magnetic resonance images obtained in the same patients. In addition to stereotactic coordinates and measurements based on distance from the sylvian fissure, gyral and sulcal landmarks were analyzed to determine their reliability in localizing the sensory areas of the tongue and lower face. The convolutional anatomy of the central area is an important guide to the identification of function. The sensory area of the tongue is recognized as a triangular region at the base of the postcentral gyrus: the sensory area of the lower face resides in the narrowed portion of the postcentral gyrus, immediately above the tongue area. Conclusions. Cortical landmarks such as the substrata of tongue and face sensory impressions are more reliable guides than stereotactic coordinates or measurements for localizing function.

Although surgery is still considered conventional treatment, at times the management can be controversial. The objectives of this article are to assess the results of each of these treatment modalities in a tertiary care acoustic neuroma referral setting. The methodology chosen was to group the patients along the initial intent to treat and then to see the results obtained. A total of 51 patients followed in the Skull Base Clinic of the McGill University Health Centre were included. The intent to treat was as follows: observation, 22 patients; surgery, 26 patients; and radiosurgery, 3 patients. The results showed that 50% of those followed by observation demonstrated growth and required surgery or radiotherapy. Surgical results, in terms of facial nerve outcome, varied with turnout size but also improved dramatically with the introduction of facial nerve monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach. In small and medium-size tumours (< 30 mm), intent to treat by observation or by surgery (with intraoperative monitoring) yielded similar. results. The limitations of this study are discussed. In the future, a prospective multicentric study may help better in assessing the value of the various management options.

To address this issue, we have studied synaptic vesicle dynamics in cultured rat neurones under conditions where neurotransmitter release is triggered independently of Ca2+ using the secretagogue Ruthenium Red (RR). Using a prolonged stimulation protocol, we find that RR causes a rapid increase in neurotransmitter release followed by a gradually decrementing response. In contrast, when release is triggered by moderate membrane depolarisation caused by saline containing 18 mm K+, release is sustained. These observations suggest that when release is triggered independently of a rise in Ca2+, endocytosis or vesicle mobilisation/priming are perturbed. Using FM2-10, a fluorescent indicator of synaptic vesicle cycling, we find that neurotransmitter release triggered by RR is accompanied by both uptake and release of this dye, thereby suggesting that vesicle endocytosis is not blocked. To evaluate whether synaptic vesicle mobilisation/priming is perturbed in the absence of a rise in Ca2+, we compared the kinetics of FM2-10 loss during prolonged stimulation. While 18 mm K+ induced gradual and continuous dye loss, RR only induced substantial dye loss during the first minute of stimulation. In the presence of low concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, release caused by RR was prolonged. Taken together, these results provide evidence suggesting that, although a rise in intraterminal Ca2+ is not required for endocytosis, it is essential for the continuous delivery of fusion-competent vesicles and to maintain neurotransmitter release during prolonged stimulation.

In this article, we will review the results of these studies with respect specifically to the use of radiotherapy, and trace the developments that have led up to the present trials for patients with this tumor. Procedure. Published and unpublished data from the North American CCG and POG and now COG studies, from the UKCCG and SIOP groups, as well as from the French and German groups were reviewed. Issues of especial interest included radiotherapy dose and dose fractionation schedules, scheduling of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and technical aspects of treatment with radiotherapy that might impact on outcome. Results and Conclusions, Much progress has been made in the management of medulloblastoma in childhood as a consequence of the studies undertaken sequentially by these groups over the past two decades. It now seems clear that chemotherapy plays an important role for all patients. In patients with average risk disease, the use of chemotherapy has allowed a reduction in the dose of radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis and the combination of chemotherapy with radiotherapy appears to have brought about a significant improvement in disease-free and overall survival in this patient population, Patients with high-risk disease fare better now than in the past as a consequence of the routine use of aggressive chemotherapy and preliminary data suggest that the use of higher doses of radiation as in the POG studies is associated with a particularly favorable outcome, Accurate delivery of radiotherapy is essential for optimal results. The availability of better tools at the treating centres and quality control as an integral part of cooperative studies are likely to bring about further improvements in outcome in the future.

A gene product related to SST, cortistatin (CST), also interacts with SSTR1-5. Here we have investigated the regulation of SSTR1-5 and of CST in SST knockout (SSTKO) mice. The five SSTRs were quantitated individually by subtype-selective binding analysis, by immunocytochemistry, and by mRNA measurement and showed, in the brain of SSTKO mice, up-regulation of subtypes 1, 2, 4, and 5, and down-regulation of SSTR3. Peripheral tissues displayed both subtype- and tissue-specific changes in SSTR1-5 mRNA levels of expression. Lack of SST did not up-regulate normal CST expression in brain nor did it induce its expression in the periphery. SST-like immunoreactivity, however, was induced in the proximal midgut in SSTKO animals, suggesting intestinal expression of a novel SST-like gene.

Folate intake corrects hyperhomocysteinemia and prevents up to 70% of NTD. The curly-tail (ct) mouse, an animal model for NTD, has been suggested to display features that closely resemble the human defect. We therefore investigated folate metabolism in ct mice. On control and folate-/choline-deficient diets, ct mice exhibited higher plasma homocysteine levels than control C57B1/6 mice. This increase was associated with increased liver S-Adenosylhomocysteine and decreased S-adenosylmethionine:S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAM/SAH) ratios. Since the ct locus maps in close proximity to the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr), a modifier of homocysteine levels in man, we also assayed Mthfr activity and sequenced the 5' regulatory region; these experiments suggested that Mthfr is not defective in the et strain. Finally, we examined the influence of dietary folate on NTD incidence in the ct strain, but did not identify significant differences among the four diets used in the study. Our work suggests that altered homocysteine metabolism may contribute to the pathogenetic mechanism of the ct defect, but, unlike human NTD, nutritional or genetic deficiencies in folate metabolism do not appear to play a significant direct role.

Because recent evidence suggests that secondary inflammation and caspase activation may contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS, we tested the effects of minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline with anti-inflammatory properties, in mice expressing a mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G37R)) linked to human ALS. Administration of minocycline into the diet, beginning at late presymptomatic stage (7 or 9 months of age), delayed the onset of motor neuron degeneration, muscle strength decline, and it increased the longevity of SOD1(G37R) mice by similar to5 weeks for similar to70% of tested mice. Moreover, less activation of microglia was detected at early symptomatic stage (46 weeks) and at the end stage of disease in the spinal cord of SOD1(G37R) mice treated with minocycline. These results indicate that minocycline, which is clinically well tolerated, may represent a novel and effective drug for treatment of ALS. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

In particular, ammonia exposure of the brain in vivo or in vitro preparations leads to alterations of glutamate transport. Exposure of cultured astrocytes to ammonia results in reduced high affinity uptake sites for glutamate due to a reduction in expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter GLAST. On the other hand, acute liver failure leads to decreased expression of a second astrocytic glutamate transporter GLT-1 and a consequent reduction in glutamate transport sites in brain. Effects of the chronic exposure of brain to ammonia on cellular glutamate transport are less clear. The loss of glutamate transporter activity in brain in acute liver failure and hyperammonemia is associated with increased extracellular brain glutamate concentrations which may be responsible for the hyperexcitability and cerebral edema observed in hyperammonemic disorders.

In addition to its effect on neurotransmission and energy metabolism, ammonia modulates the expression of various genes including the astrocytic "peripheral-type" benzodiazepine (or omega 3) receptor (PTBR). Increased expression of the isoquinoline carboxamide binding protein (IBP), one of the components of the PTBR complex, is observed in brain and peripheral tissues following chronic liver failure as well as in cultured astrocytes exposed to ammonia. Increased densities of binding sites for the PTBR ligand [H-3]-PK11195 are also observed in these conditions as well as in brains of animals with acute liver failure, congenital urea cycle disorders and in patients who died in hepatic coma. The precise role of PTBR in brain function has not yet fully elucidated, but among other functions, PTBR mediates the transport of cholesterol across the mitochondrial membrane and thus plays a key role in the biosynthesis of neurosteroids some of which modulate major neurotransmitter systems such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) and glutamate (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)) receptors. Activation of PTBR in chronic and acute hyperammonemia results in increased synthesis of neurosteroids which could lead to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS.

In order to determine the effects of acute hyperammonemia in vivo on GFAP expression, brain extracts from rats with acute liver failure due to hepatic devascularization (portacaval anastomosis followed 24 h later by hepatic artery ligation, HAL) were analyzed for GFAP mRNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and appropriate oligonucleotide primers. GFAP protein was assayed by immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody. Hepatic devascularization resulted in a significant 55-68% decrease (P < 0.01) of GFAP mRNA and a concomitant loss of GFAP protein at precoma and coma stages of encephalopathy when brain water content was significantly increased and brain ammonia concentrations were in the millimolar range (1-5 mM). Expression of a second glial filament protein S-100&beta; was unaffected by acute hyperammonemia. These findings suggest a role for GFAP in cell volume regulation and that loss of GFAP expression could contribute to the pathogenesis of brain edema in acute hyperammonemic syndromes.

By using certain a priori information about the structure of the nonlinearity of the system one may utilize the appropriate proposed neuro-dynamic structure for identifying the system. The capabilities of the proposed structures for representing the nonlinear systems are shown analytically. Selection criteria for specifying the fixed structural parameters as well as the adaptation laws for updating the adjustable parameters of the identifiers are provided. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ATDNN structures are quite effective in identifying a general class of nonlinear systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This method is based on the use of the multivariate linear model on a training data set. We show that when the a priori knowledge about the expected brain response is not too precise, the method allows for the specification of a model that yields a better sensitivity in the statistical results. This obviously relies on the validity of the a priori information, in our case the representativity of the training set, an issue addressed using a cross-validation technique. We propose a fast implementation that allows the use of the method on large data sets as found with functional Magnetic Resonance Images. An example of application is given on an experimental fMRI data set that includes nine subjects who performed a mental computation task. Results show that the method increases the statistical sensitivity of fMRI analyses. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

In order to address this issue in humans, 12 healthy volunteers underwent a dietary tryptophan depletion paradigm to decrease 5-HT availability, under double-blind conditions, during which body temperature was monitored following oral administration of the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (30 mg). In addition, plasma prolactin and growth hormone evaluations, two responses that are mediated via the direct activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, were determined. The hypothesis was that if responses are mediated by decreased transmission at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, resulting from dampened 5-HT release as a consequence of 5-HT1A autoreceptors activation, then responses to the exogenous 5-HT1A agonist should be attenuated when 5-HT availability has been markedly decreased beforehand, Buspirone produced the same significant increase in prolactin and growth hormone in the tryptophan-depleted state as in the control condition. Similarly, the degree of hypothermia produced by buspirone was not significantly different in the two experimental conditions. In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that the hypothermia and the increases in prolactin and growth hormone produced by buspirone are attributable to the enhanced activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, and not to a decrease in 5-HT transmission resulting from the activation of the 5-HT1A cell body autoreceptors on 5-HT neurons.

J	Peretz, I				Peretz, I			Brain specialization for music	NEUROSCIENTIST			English	Review						music; amusia; brain; pitch	PERCEPTION; PATTERNS; APHASIA; MEMORY; AMUSIA; DEAFNESS; AGNOSIA; SKILLS; AUTISM; PITCH	Music, like language, is a universal and specific trait to humans. Similarly, music appreciation, like language comprehension, appears to be the product of a dedicated brain organization. Support for the existence of music-specific neural networks is found in various pathological conditions that isolate musical abilities from the rest of the cognitive system. Cerebrovascular accidents, traumatic brain damage, and congenital brain anomalies can lead to selective disorders of music processing. Conversely, autism and epilepsy can reveal the autonomous functioning and the selectivity, respectively, of the neural networks that subserve music. However, brain specialization for music should not be equated with the presence of a singular "musical center" in the brain. Rather, multiple interconnected neural networks are engaged, of which some may capture the essence of brain specialization for music. The encoding of pitch along musical scales is likely such an essential component. The implications of the existence of such special-purpose cortical processes are that the human brain might be hardwired for music.

B-0 DECAYS; CKM MATRIX; SEARCH; SYSTEM	We present a measurement of time-dependent CP-violating asymmetries in neutral B meson decays collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e(+)e(-) collider at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The data sample consists of 29.7 fb-1 recorded at the Y(4S) resonance and 3.9 fb-1 off resonance. One of the neutral B mesons, which are produced in pairs at the Y(4S), is fully reconstructed in the CP decay modes J/psiK(S)(0), psi(2S)K-S(0), chi(c1)K(S)(0), J/psiK(*0) (K-*0-->K(S)(0)pi(0)) and J/psiK(L)(0), or in flavor-eigenstate modes involving D((*))pi/rho/a(1) and J/psiK(*0) (K-*0-->K(+)pi(-)). The flavor of the other neutral B meson is tagged at the time of its decay, mainly with the charge of identified leptons and kaons. A neural network tagging algorithm is used to recover events without a clear lepton or kaon tag. The proper time elapsed between the decays is determined by measuring the distance between the decay vertices. Wrong-tag probabilities, the time-difference resolution function, and the B-0-(B) over bar (0) oscillation frequency Deltam(d) are measured with a sample of about 6350 fully-reconstructed B-0 decays in hadronic flavor-eigenstate modes. A maximum-likelihood fit to this flavor eigenstate sample finds Deltam(d)=0.516+/-0.016(stat)+/-0.010(syst) ps(-1). The value of the asymmetry amplitude sin 2beta is determined from a simultaneous maximum-likelihood fit to the time-difference distribution of the flavor-eigenstate sample and about 642 tagged B-0 decays in the CP-eigenstate modes. We find sin 2beta=0.59+/-0.14(stat)+/-0.05(syst), demonstrating that CP violation exists in the neutral B meson system. We also determine the value of the CP violation parameter \lambda\=0.93+/-0.09(stat)+/-0.03(syst), which is consistent with the expectation of \lambda\=1 for no direct CP violation.

However, a recent study by Howe and colleagues indicates that neurotrophin signaling via the trkA receptor requires formation of a signaling endosome containing NGF and trkA. Thus, endocytosis of the neurotrophin-receptor complex is a crucial step in the generation of intracellular signaling platforms required for activation and compartmentalization of signaling events.

Objective: To investigate a possible role for the MAOA and MAOB genes in RLS using a population-based association study. Methods: In addition to a dinucleotide repeat located within the second intron of the MAOB gene, a functional variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism recently identified in the MAOA gene promoter region was examined, using 96 extensively characterized patients and 200 control subjects matched for ethnic background. The relationship between variation at these loci and several clinical features was also considered. Results: Pertaining to the MAOA gene, females with the high activity allele had a greater risk (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.06 to 3.77) of being affected with RLS than females carrying the low activity alleles. The authors did not observe this association among the male subjects (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.31 to 3.14). Interestingly, females carrying the high transcription alleles showed a longer sleep onset latency (U = 163.5; p = 0.015) and exhibited a higher movement index during the Suggested Immobilization Test (Student's t-test = -2.02; p = 0.048). No differences were observed regarding the MAOB gene in our sample. Conclusions: The high activity allele of the MAOA gene may represent a modifying factor involved in the severity of RLS manifestations in females.

In wild-type sciatic nerves, PMP-22 associates in a specific, transient (t(1/2) approximate to 11 min), and oligosaccharide processing-dependent manner with the lectin chaperone calnexin (CNX), but not calreticulin nor BiP. In Trembler-J (Tr-J) sciatic nerves, prolonged association of mutant PMP-22 with CNX is found (t(1/2) > 60 min). In 293A cells overexpressing PMP-22(Tr-J), CNX and PMP-22 colocalize in large intracellular structures identified at the electron microscopy level as myelin-like figures with CNX localization in the structures dependent on PMP-22 glucosylation. Similar intracellular myelin-like figures were also present in Schwann cells of sciatic nerves from homozygous Trembler-J mice with no detectable activation of the stress response pathway as deduced from BiP and CHOP expression. Sequestration of CNX in intracellular myelin-like figures may be relevant to the autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth-related neuropathies.

This paper examines the robustness of using neural networks as a simulation metamodel to estimate manufacturing system performances. Simulation models of a job shop system are developed for various configurations to train neural network metamodels. Extensive computational tests are carried out with the proposed models at various factor levels (study horizon, system load, initial system status, stochasticity, system size and error assessment methods) to see the metamodel accuracy. The results indicate that simulation metamodels with neural networks can be effectively used to estimate the system performances.

We hypothesised that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase inhibition would affect cell viability through decreased methionine synthesis. Using medium lacking methionine, but containing homocysteine and vitamin B, (M-H+), we found that nontransformed human fibroblasts could maintain growth. In contrast, four transformed cell lines (one colon carcinoma, two neuroblastoma and one breast carcinoma) increased proliferation only slightly in the M-H+ medium. To downregulate methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase expression, two phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides, EX5 and 677T. were used to target methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in the colon carcinoma line SW620 400 nM of each antisense oligonucleotide decreased cell survival by approximately 80% (P < 0.01) and 70% (P < 0.0001), respectively, compared to cell survival after the respective control mismatched oligonucleotide. Western blotting and enzyme assays confirmed that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase expression was decreased. Two neuroblastoma and two breast carcinoma lines also demonstrated decreased survival following EX5 treatment whereas nontransformed human fibroblasts were not affected, This study suggests that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase may be required for tumour cell survival and that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase inhibition should be considered for anti-tumour therapy, (C) 2002 Cancer Research UK.

Although a role for DNA methylation in regulating histone acetylation has been established, it is not clear how and whether epigenetic histone markings influence DNA modifications in transcriptional silencing. We have previously shown that induction of histone acetylation by trichostatin A promotes demethylation of ectopically methylated DNA (Cervoni, N., and Szyf, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 40778-40787). The oncoprotein Set/TAF-Ibeta is a subunit of the recently identified inhibitor of acetyltransferases complex that inhibits histone acetylation by binding to and masking histone acetyltransferase targets (Seo, S. B., McNamara, P., Heo, S., Turner, A., Lane, W. S., and Chakravarti, D. (2001) Cell 104, 119-130). We show here that the overexpression of Set/TAF-Ibeta, whose expression is up-regulated in multiple tumor tissues, inhibits demethylation of ectopically methylated DNA resulting in gene silencing. Overexpression of a mutant Set/TAF-Ibeta that does not inhibit histone acetylation is defective in inhibiting DNA demethylation. Taken together, these results are consistent with a novel regulatory role for Set/TAF-Ibeta, integrating epigenetic states of histones and DNA in gene regulation and provide a new mechanism that can explain how hypermethylation of specific regions might come about by inhibition of demethylation in cancer cells.

Activation of cardiac OTR stimulates the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is involved in regulation of blood pressure and cell growth. Having observed elevated OT levels in the fetal and newborn heart at a stage of intense cardiomyocyte hyperplasia, we hypothesized a role for OT in cardiomyocyte differentiation. We used mouse P19 embryonic stem cells to substantiate this potential role. P19 cells give rise to the formation of cell derivatives of all germ layers. Treatment of P19 cell aggregates with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induces differentiation to cardiomyocytes. In this work, P19 cells were allowed to aggregate from day 0 to day 4 in the presence of 0.5% DMSO, 10(-7) M OT and/or 10(-7) M OT antagonist (OTA), and then cultured in the absence of these factors until day 14. OT alone stimulated the production of beating cell colonies in all 24 independently growing cultures by day 8 of the differentiation protocol, whereas the same result was obtained in cells induced by DMSO only after 12 days. Cells induced with OT exhibited increased ANP mRNA, had abundant mitochondria (i.e., they strongly absorbed rhodamine 123), and expressed sarcomeric myosin heavy chain and dihydropyridine receptor-all, confirming a cardiomyocyte phenotype. In addition, OT as well as DMSO increased OTR protein and OTR mRNA, and OTA completely inhibited the formation of cardiomyocytes in OT- and DMSO-supplemented cultures. These results suggest that the OT/OTR system plays an important role in cardiogenesis by promoting cardiomyocyte differentiation.

As CsA does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, the variability may be due to differences in bioavailability of CsA to the ischemic brain. We have, therefore, quantitated CsA levels in blood and brain following intra-carotid injection in rats undergoing permanent right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion using a three-vessel model of focal cerebral ischemia. After 30 min of three-vessel occlusion, CsA (10 mg/kg) was injected into the left external carotid artery followed by reversal of the left common carotid artery occlusion. At various times post-injection, blood samples were collected from the vena cava and samples of ischemic or sham-operated cortex were obtained for CsA quantitation by tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. CsA areas under the curve between normal and stroke-induced rats were not significantly different in blood (18 355 vs. 19 405 ng.h/ml, NS) or in brain tissue (15 664 vs. 14 931 ng.h/g, NS). These results demonstrate that intra-carotid injection of CsA results in high levels in brain (brain-blood ratio from 0.5 to 1). No significant differences in blood and brain exposure were observed between normal and stroke-induced rats. Therefore, reduced cerebral bloods flow in the ischemic territory did not limit CsA availability to the cortex. In addition, CsA intra-carotid administration was neuroprotective following 24 h recovery as there was a significant decrease in the infarct area of the affected hemisphere compared to saline injected rats as estimated by TTC staining of viable tissue.

After two PSM cases in our hospital an epidemiological study was initiated, which included a survey of techniques for asepsis that are applied in our department. Methods: Cases defined as PSM comprised meningitis within a week after spinal anesthesia. Anesthesia records, anesthesia complication files and the records of the Hospital Commission for Infection Control from 1997 to 2000 were reviewed. Asepsis techniques applied were surveyed by a questionnaire answered by all our department's anesthesiologists. The equipment and procedures for spinal anesthesia were listed. Current anesthesia textbooks were reviewed for recommendations regarding asepsis techniques in conjunction with spinal anesthesia. Results: Three cases of PSM were identified following 38,128 spinal anesthesias whereas none was observed in 12,822 patients subjected to other types of regional or general anesthesia (P>0.05). Culture of cerebrospinal fluid yielded Streptococcus in two patients and was negative in the other patient. The asepsis technique applied by the anesthesiologists varied considerably. The literature review showed that aspects on asepsis for spinal anesthesia are poorly covered. Conclusion: The incidence of meningitis was similar in patients subjected to spinal anesthesia and in those subjected to other anesthetic techniques. Asepsis techniques were found to differ considerably among our staff members, reflecting the lack of well-defined published standards for this procedure. We recommend that asepsis for spinal anesthesia should not be less rigorous than for surgical asepsis.

To investigate the molecular basis of the disorder, we have characterized the structure of the MTR gene, thereby identifying exon-intron boundaries. This enabled amplification of each of the 33 exons of the gene, from genomic DNA from a panel of 21 patients with cblG. Thirteen novel mutations were identified. These included five deletions (c. 12-13delGC, c.381delA, c.2101delT, c.2669-2670delTG, and c. 2796-2800delAAGTC) and two nonsense mutations (R585X and E1204X) that would result in synthesis of truncated proteins that lack portions critical for enzyme function. One mutation was identified that resulted in conversion of A to C of the invariant A of the 3 splice site of intron 9. Five missense mutations (A410P, S437Y, S450H, H595P, and I804T) were identified. The latter mutations, as well as the splice-site mutation, were not detected in a panel of 50 anonymous DNA samples, suggesting that these sequence changes are not polymorphisms present in the general population. In addition, a previously described missense mutation, P1173L, was detected in 16 patients in an expanded panel of 24 patients with cblG. Analysis of haplotypes constructed using sequence polymorphisms identified within the MTR gene demonstrated that this mutation, a C-->T transition in a CpG island, has occurred on at least two separate genetic backgrounds.

We have previously shown that a low-sodium diet, given to pregnant rats over the last week of gestation, results in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). We hypothesize that pups born with IUGR are more susceptible to the development of hypertension in adulthood. IUGR fetuses and rats aged 1 wk were characterized for organ growth and renal morphogenesis. The adults (12 wk) were evaluated for weight, systolic blood pressure, activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and renal function; hearts and kidneys underwent a histological examination. Brain and cardiac ventricle-to-body ratios were increased in IUGR fetuses compared with age-matched controls, whereas the kidney-to-body ratio was unchanged. Systolic blood pressure was elevated in both IUGR male and female adults. Plasma aldosterone levels were not correlated with increased plasma renin activity. Moreover, urinary sodium was decreased, whereas plasma urea was elevated in both males and females, and creatinine levels were augmented only in females, suggesting a glomerular filtration impairment in IUGR. In our model of IUGR induced by a low-sodium diet given to pregnant rats, high blood pressure, alteration of the RAAS, and renal dysfunction are observed in adult life. Differences observed between male and female adults suggest the importance of gender in outcomes in adulthood after IUGR.

We performed this study to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic significance of exocrine differentiation by immunohistochemistry in pancreatic endocrine tumors that do not show morphologic features of acinar cell differentiation. Routinely processed tissue sections from 87 pancreatic endocrine tumors were immunohistochemically stained with monoclonal antibodies against acinar (lipase. chymotrypsin. trypsin) and endocrine cell markers (chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, Leu-7) and for the proliferation-associated peptide Ki67. The degree of staining with each marker was graded on a three-tier scale for acinar markers (grade 0, <5%; grade 1, 5-10%: grade 2, 11-25%; and grade 3, >25%) and on a four-tier scale for endocrine markers (grade 0, <5%; grade 1.5-25%; grade 2, 26-50%; grade 3, 51-75%; and grade 4, >75%), and the results were correlated with clinical outcome (mean follow-up 53 months), Greater than 75% of the tumor cells stained for chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, and Leu-7 in 100%, 96%, 93%. and 27% of cases, respectively. Overall, 66% of tumors stained positively for at least one acinar cell marker, 31% stained for at least two acinar cell markers, and 13% stained for all three acinar cell markers. Forty-seven percent stained for lipase (23 grade 1, 11 grade 2. seven grade 3), 37% for trypsin (22 grade 1, three grade 2, seven grade 3), and 25% stained for chymotrypsin (13 grade 1, five grade 1 four grade 3). No correlation was noted between the presence or extent of expression of any single or combination of acinar cell markers and clinical outcome, However, higher tumor stage correlated with a poor clinical outcome (p = 0.002). and location in the tail of the pancreas was associated with a longer interval to tumor recurrence (p = 0.03). The presence of synaptophysin (p = 0.03) and Leu-7 expression (p = 0.03) correlated significantly with less aggressive clinical behavior. An association was observed between increased Ki67 labeling and poorer clinical outcome, but this was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In conclusion, immunophenotypic evidence of acinar cell differentiation is common in pancreatic endocrine tumors, but this feature does not have any relevance to clinical prognosis. However, in addition to tumor stage, location in the pancreatic tail and the immunohistochemical expression of synaptophysin and/or Leu-7 may be useful prognostic indicators in patients with these lesions.

Left ventricular free wall rupture is an uncommon but catastrophic event after myocardial infarction and is associated with a high mortality. After prompt diagnosis some patients may be salvaged with immediate surgical intervention. Surgical techniques used to seal the rupture vary, as few surgeons have experience with this pathologic process. We report our experience using a sutureless patch technique to treat this entity. Methods. A review of 6 consecutive patients during an 8-year period who were referred to one cardiac unit with postinfarction left ventricular rupture was conducted. Results. There were 3 men and 3 women with an average age of 71.8 years. All were hemodynamically unstable, and 4 were in electromechanical dissociation. Echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis in 5 patients, and cardiac catheterization had been performed in 4 before rupture. All patients were treated promptly with fluid, inotropic agents, and, if needed, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and pericardiocentesis. Resuscitation was continued in the operating room, and the myocardial tear was sealed with a generous patch of unsupported felt secured to the heart with cyanoacrylate glue. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 3 patients if the anatomy was known. All patients survived to the intensive care unit. One death occurred as a result of severe neurologic injury. Five patients were discharged from the hospital, and all were alive 2 months to 7.5 years after operation. Conclusions. A sutureless patch technique for the treatment of postinfarction rupture is simple, effective, and associated with a favorable outcome. (C) 2002 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons 30.

By these standards, a vulture breaking an egg by hitting it with a stone uses a tool, but a gull dropping an egg on a rock does not. This distinction between true and borderline (or proto-tool) cases has been criticized for its arbitrariness and anthropocentrism. We show here that relative size of the neostriatum and whole brain distinguish the true and borderline categories in birds using tools to obtain food or water. From two sources, the specialized literature on tools and an innovation data base gathered in the short note sections of 68 journals in 7 areas of the world, we collected 39 true (e.g. use of probes, hammers, sponges, scoops) and 86 borderline (e.g. bait fishing, battering and dropping on anvils, holding with wedges and skewers) cases of tool use in 104 species from 15 parvorders. True tool users have a larger mean residual brain size (regressed against body weight) than do users of borderline tools, confirming the distinction in the literature. In multiple regressions, residual brain size and residual size of the neostriatum (one of the areas in the avian telencephalon thought to be equivalent to the mammalian neocortex) are the best predictors of true tool use reports per taxon. Innovation rate is the best predictor of borderline tool use distribution. Despite the strong concentration of true tool use cases in Corvida and Passerida, independent constrasts suggest that common ancestry is not responsible for the association between tool use and size of the neostriatum and whole brain. Our results demonstrate that birds are more frequent tool users than usually thought and that the complex cognitive processes involved in tool use may have repeatedly co-evolved with large brains in several orders of birds.

This study was designed to examine the effects of intrathecal (i.t.) infusion of a metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) antisense oligonucleotide, concomitant with chronic morphine treatment, on the development of tolerance to morphine's antinociceptive effects. 2 All rats received chronic (6 day) s.c. administration of morphine to induce opioid tolerance. Additionally, rats were treated with either mGluR1 antisense (AS), missense (MIS) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) by i.t. infusion via chronically implanted i.t. catheters connected to osmotic mini-pumps. The effects of acute i.t. or s.c. morphine on tail-flick latencies were assessed prior to and following chronic s.c. morphine treatment for all chronic i.t. infusion groups. mGluR1 protein level in the spinal cord was determined by Western blot analysis for all treatments, assessing the efficiency of knock-down with AS treatment. 3 Acute i.t. morphine dose-dependently produced antinociception in the tail-flick test in naive rats. Systemic morphine-treated rats administered i.t. ACSF or MIS developed tolerance to i.t. morphine. Chronic i.t. infusion with mGluR1 AS significantly reduced the development of tolerance to i.t. morphine. 4 In contrast to i.t. morphine, tolerance developed to the antinociceptive effects of s.c. morphine, in all i.t. infusion groups, including the mGluR1 AS group. 5 The spinal mGluR1 protein level was dramatically decreased after mGluR1 AS infusion when compared to control animals (naive and ACSF-treated animals). 6 These findings suggest that the spinal mGluR1 is involved in the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine. Selective blockade of mGluR1 may be beneficial in preventing the development of opioid analgesic tolerance.

Surprisingly, the cloning and characterisation of mammalian clock genes have revealed that they are expressed in a cireadian manner throughout the body. It is generally accepted now that peripheral cells contain a circadian clock which is similar to the one present in SCN neurons, although only the latter seems to be self-sustained. It is still unclear how these peripheral clocks are synchronised by the central SCN clock, albeit humoral signals appear to be crucial. Interestingly, peripheral clocks can be uncoupled from the central clock in particular conditions such as restricted-feeding, allowing peripheral tissues to adapt themselves to cues incompatible to other cues perceived by the SCN (mainly the photoperiod). Whereas circadian clocks have been intensively dissected, little is known about the mechanisms by which these clocks regulate the expression of clock-controlled genes. Direct regulation for some of them by the products of clock genes was recently documented, but this probably represents the exception rather than the rule. We should soon be able to describe complete circadian transcriptional cascades from clock genes to enzymes and structural proteins. In addition to circadian humoral and neural signals, these cascades should help us to understand how gene expression, physiology and behaviour are influenced by the rotation of the Earth around its axis.

J	Castonguay, A; Robitaille, R				Castonguay, A; Robitaille, R			Xestospongin C is a potent inhibitor of SERCA at a vertebrate synapse	CELL CALCIUM			English	Article							INOSITOL 1,4,5-TRISPHOSPHATE RECEPTOR; PERISYNAPTIC SCHWANN-CELLS; FROG NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; NERVE-TERMINALS; CALCIUM CHANNELS; RYANODINE; ACTIVATION; STORES; GLIA	The specificity of action of Xestospongin C (XeC) towards the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor has been studied using the frog neuromuscular junction. In perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), glial cells at this synapse, Ca2+ stores are dependent upon IP3 activation. Bath application of XeC (700 nM) caused a transient calcium elevation and blocked Ca2+ responses evoked in PSCs by synaptic activity or various agonists (ATP, muscarine, adenosine) only when Ca2+ stores had previously been challenged with local application of agonists. Moreover, XeC occluded the effects of thapsigargin (tg; 2 muM), a blocker of the Ca2+ ATPase pump of internal stores, which failed to evoke Ca2+ transients following 20 min of exposure to XeC. In nerve terminals, where the Ca2+ stores are ryanodine-sensitive, application of XeC (700 nM) prolonged the recovery phase of Ca2+ transients evoked by single action potentials, due to a prolonged Ca2+ clearance in the nerve terminal. No effects of tg (2 muM) were observed on Ca2+ response evoked by nerve stimulation when applied on the preparation after XeC (700 nM). Conversely, XeC (700 nM) had no effect on the shape and duration of Ca2+ entry in nerve terminals when tg was applied before XeC. These results indicate that XeC acts as an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump of internal stores. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The degree to which genetic and environmental factors mediate PT asymmetry is not known. This study examined the heritability for planar asymmetry in 12 dizygotic (DZ) and 27 monozygotic (MZ) male twin pairs who were between 6 and 16 years of age. There was weak but positive evidence for heritability of planar asymmetry. Co-twin similarity for planar asymmetry and Sylvian fissure morphology increased when excluding twins discordant for writing hand and when excluding twins exhibiting birth weight differences >20% from the analyses. Birth weight differences were also related to twin differences in total cerebral volume, but not central sulcus asymmetry. These results suggest that exogenous perinatal factors affect the epigenesis of planar asymmetry development.

However, dopa therapies are generally ineffective at reversing these deficits, except for tasks involving a sharing of attention such as working memory or simultaneous processing tasks. The aim of this study was to assess the relation between the nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation in PD, as measured by SPECT with (123)Iodine-beta-CIT and the cognitive deficits, as measured by a simultaneous processing task, which had already been shown to be sensitive to dopa treatment. Ten patients with PD and ten control subjects were selected and matched for age, sex, and education. All subjects were assessed using computed visuo-auditory tasks which allow for the measurement of three cognitive processing conditions: 1) a Selective Processing Time; 2) a Competitive Processing Time; and 3) a Simultaneous Processing Time. Patients with PD were assessed both with (ON) and without (OFF) their usual dopaminergic treatment. The simultaneous processing condition but not the selective or the competitive conditions took significantly more time for patients with PD OFF than for either the control subjects or the patients with PD ON. In addition, when patients with PD were OFF, the simultaneous processing condition was correlated with the (23)Iodine-beta-CIT binding, but not when they were ON. These results suggest that nigrostriatal DA denervation may be involved in the specific impairment that patients with PD experience with simultaneous cognitive processing.

Vitamin A deprivation leads to severe congenital malformations affecting many tissues, including diverse neural crest cell populations and the heart. The vitamin A signal is transduced by the retinoic acid receptors (RARalpha, RARbeta, and RARgamma). However, these receptors exhibit considerable functional redundancy, as judged by the mild phenotype of RAR single null mutants relative to the defects evoked by loss of multiple RARs. To circumvent this redundancy, the endogenous RARgamma2 allele was replaced with a ligand-binding RARgamma mutant (RARgammaE(305))by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Chimeric embryos derived from hemizygous RARgammaE(305) ES cells displayed several defects similar to those observed in certain RAR double null mutants, including hypoplasia or absence of the caudal pharyngeal arches and myocardial deficiencies. The latter defects were not due to abnormal cardiac specification as affected hearts still expressed chamber-specific markers in an appropriate manner. Chimeras also displayed cardiac looping anomalies, which were associated with a reduction of Pitx2. This work suggests a role for RAR signaling in late looping morphogenesis and illustrates the utility of using a dominant-negative gene substitution approach to circumvent the functional redundancy inherent to the RAR family.

Of 111 children diagnosed with CP (aged 4 to 12 years), only 75 were suitable for neuropsychological testing, assessing attention, working memory, processing speed, and psychosocial functioning. The children received 40 sessions of HBO2 or sham treatment over a 2-month period. Children in the active treatment group were exposed for 1 hour to 100% oxygen at 1.75 atmospheres absolute (ATA), whereas those in the sham group received only air at 1.3 ATA. Children in both groups showed better self-control and significant improvements in auditory attention and visual working memory compared with the baseline. However, no statistical difference was found between the two treatments. Furthermore, the sham group improved significantly on eight dimensions of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale, whereas the active treatment group improved only on one dimension. Most of these positive changes persisted for 3 months. No improvements were observed in either group for verbal span, visual attention, or processing speed.

We undertook the characterization of the capillary bed of the rat frontal cortex and their permeability properties in short-term and long-term diabetic rats. Methods. Diabetes was induced by strepozotocin injection. Rats were maintained hyperglycaemic without insulin treatment during 4 to 5 months (short-term) and 8 to 13 months (long-term). Rats from an additional short-term hyperglycaemic group received an injection of exogenous dinitrophenylated albumin 15 min before being killed. Tissues were processed for electron microscopy and quantitative immunocytochemistry. Endogenous and dinitrophenylated exogenous albumin were revealed with high resolution over the capillary wall using specific antibodies and the protein A-gold complex. Morphometrical analyses were carried out. Results. Albumin is transported across endothelial cells by plasmalemmal vesicles or caveolae and larger vacuolar structures. This transport increased in diabetic rats by an increment in the number of vesicles. Albumin distribution across the capillary basement membrane showed that the restrictive properties of the basement membrane present in normoglycaemic rats are altered in the diabetic condition, as was its thickness. Similar alterations of the basement membrane structure and function were encountered in old normoglycaemic rats but to a lesser extent. Conclusion/interpretation. The results indicate that diabetes seems to accelerate the ageing process of the vascular wall and that the central nervous system capillary bed is also a target for diabetic microangiopathy.

Here, we report the characterization of PAC1-R and novel splice variants in the frog Rana ridibunda. The frog PAC1-R has 78% homology with human PAC1-R and is highly expressed in the central nervous system. Two splice variants of the frog receptor that display additional amino acid cassettes in the third intracellular loop were characterized. PAC1-R25 carries a 25-amino acid insertion that matches the hop cassette of the mammalian receptor, whereas PAC1-R41 carries a cassette with no homology to any mammalian PAC1-R variant. A third splice variant of PAC1-R, exhibiting a completely different intracellular C-terminal domain, named PAC1-Rmc has also been identified. Determination of cAMP formation in cells transfected with the cloned receptors showed that PACAP activated PAC1-R, PAC1-R25, and PAC1-R41 with similar potency. In contrast, PACAP failed to stimulate adenylate cyclase in cells transfected with PAC1 Rmc. Fusion of PAC1-R or PAC1-Rmc with the green fluorescent protein revealed that both receptors are expressed and targeted to the plasma membrane in transfected cells. The different PAC1-R variants are highly expressed in the frog brain and spinal cord and to a lesser extent in peripheral tissues, where only certain isoforms could be detected.

Methods: Extracellular field-potential recordings were performed in neocortical slices obtained from Wistar rats aged 25-50 days. Rat neocortical neurons in culture were subjected to the whole-cell mode of voltage clamping under experimental conditions designed to study voltage-gated K+ currents. Results: In the in vitro slice preparation, LTG (100-400 muM) reduced and/or abolished epileptiform discharges induced by 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 100 muM; n = 10), at doses that were significantly higher than those required to affect epileptiform activity recorded in Mg2+-free medium (n = 8). We also discovered that in cultured cortical cells, LTG (100-500 muM; n = 13) increased a transient, 4AP-sensitive, outward Current elicited by depolarizing commands in medium containing voltage-gated Ca2+ and Na+ channel antagonists. Moreover, we did not observe any change in a late, tetraethylammonium-sensitive outward Current. Conclusions: Our data indicate that LTG, in addition to the well-known reduction of voltage-gated Na+ currents, potentiates 4AP-sensitive, K+-mediated hyperpolarizing conductances in cortical neurons. This mechanism of action contributes to the anticonvulsant effects exerted by LTG in experimental models of epileptiform discharge, and presumably in clinical practice.

Methods: Eighteen patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were investigated with intracranial depth electrodes implanted in the amygdala (AM), anterior hippocampus (HP), and parahippocampal gyrus (PH). Focal and regional ictal-onset morphologies were classified as rhythmic limbic spiking <2 Hz (RLS), spike-and-wave activity >2 Hz (S/W), rhythmic polyspike activity >13 Hz (RPS), and rhythmic sharp activity <13 Hz (RS). Results: Onset morphologies in 389 total seizures (260 regional + 129 focal) were 50% RPS, 35% RS, 11% RLS, and 4% S/W. Focal AM or HP onsets (30% and 58% of focal onsets, respectively) were more likely to show RLS, whereas RPS was more common in regional onsets. Most patients showed two or more different morphologies and focal onsets at more than one ipsilateral limbic site. Seizure propagation and clinical manifestations were significantly more common with AM or PH onsets (both 67% clinical seizures): only 23% of focal HP onsets resulted in clinical seizures. Conclusions: (a) There is substantial inter- and intrapatient variability in the morphology and localization of mesial temporal seizure onsets, which suggests that the epileptogenic temporolimbic system may be conceptualized as a dynamic network containing a multiplicity of potential ictal generators: (b) Seizures beginning in the AM or PH are more likely to propagate and dive rise to clinical manifestations than are focal-onset HP seizures, which suggests that inhibitory circuits within the HP may function to prevent seizure spread.

The ACCPN gene was mapped in 1996 to a 4 cM region on chromosome 15. We have since collected additional French Canadian (FC) families and typed a total of 11 polymorphic markers spanning approximately 18 cM on chromosome 15. Through the use of haplotype analysis we have confirmed the presence of a founder haplotype in the FC population, and identified critical recombinants which reduce the ACCPN candidate interval to a approximate to2 cM or 1000 Kb region flanked by markers D15S1040 and ACTC. Linkage disequilibrium analysis, supports the haplotype data, and suggests that the ACCPN gene lies nearest to marker D15S1232.

This region occupies the dorsal part of the ventrolateral prefrontal convexity just below area 9/46v. Rostroventral to area 45 in the human brain lies a large cortical region labelled as area 47 by Brodmann. The ventrolateral component of this region extending as far as the lateral orbital sulcus has architectonic characteristics similar to those of the ventrolateral prefrontal region labelled by Walker as area 12 in the macaque monkey. We designated this region in both the human and the monkey ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as area 47/12. Thus, area 47/12 designates the specific part of the zone previously labelled as area 47 in the human brain that has the same overall architectonic pattern as that of Walker's area 12 in the macaque monkey brain. The cortical connections of these two areas were examined in the monkey by injecting fluorescent retrograde tracers. Although both area 45 and area 47/12 as defined here had complex multimodal input, they could be differentiated in terms of some of their inputs. Retrograde tracers restricted to area 47/12 resulted in heavy labelling of neurons in the rostral inferotemporal visual association cortex and in temporal limbic areas (i.e. perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex). In contrast, injections of tracers into dorsally adjacent area 45 demonstrated strong labelling in the superior temporal gyrus (i.e. the auditory association cortex) and the multimodal cortex in the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus.

Surprisingly, we have little information about the mechanisms for integrating these different signals into a single sensory percept. With the eventual aim of studying the underlying central neural mechanisms, we developed a shape discrimination test that required active exploration of objects, but was restricted to one component of shape, two-dimensional (2D) angles. The angles were machined from 1-cm-thick Plexiglas, and consisted of two 8-cm-long arms that met to form an angle of 90degrees (standard) or 91degrees to 103degrees (comparison angles). Subjects scanned pairs of angles with the index finger of the outstretched arm and identified the larger angle of each pair explored. Discrimination threshold (75% correct) was 4.7degrees (range 0.7degrees to 12.1degrees), giving a precision of 5.2% (0.8-13.4%: difference/standard). Repeated blocks of trials, either in the same session or on different days, had no effect on discrimination threshold. In contrast, the motor strategy was partly modified: scanning speed increased but dwell-time at the intersection did not change. Finally, 2D angle discrimination was not significantly modified by rotating the orientation of one of the angles in the pair (0degrees, 4degrees or 8degrees rotation towards the midline, in the vertical plane), providing evidence that subjects evaluated each angle independently in each trial. Subject reports indicated that they relied on cutaneous feedback from the exploring digit (amount of compression of the finger at the angle) and mental images of the angles, most likely arising from proprioceptive information (from the shoulder) generated during the to-and-fro scans over the angle. In terms of shoulder angles, the mean discrimination threshold here was 0.54degrees (range 0.08degrees to 1.36degrees). These values are lower than previous estimates of position sense at the shoulder. In light of the subjects' strategies, it therefore seems likely that both cutaneous and proprioceptive (including both dynamic and static position-related signals) feedback contributed to the haptic discrimination of 2D angles.

Using a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm, subjects identified the larger angle in each pair explored (standard angle, 90degrees; comparison angles, 91degrees to 103degrees). Subjects were tested under four experimental conditions: (1) active touch (reference condition); (2) active touch with digital anaesthesia; (3) passive touch (a computer-controlled device displaced the angle under the subject's immobile digit); and (4) passive touch with digital anaesthesia. When only proprioceptive feedback from the shoulder was available (condition 2), there was a significant increase in discrimination threshold, from 4.0degrees in the reference condition (condition 1) to 7.2degrees, indicating that cutaneous feedback from the exploring digit contributed to task performance. When only cutaneous feedback from the finger was available (condition 3), there was also a significant increase in threshold from 4.2degrees in the active condition to 8.7degrees. This suggested that proprioceptive feedback from the shoulder, potentially from a variety of deep (muscle and joint) but also cutaneous receptors, contributed to the ability to discriminate small changes in 2D angles. When both sources of feedback were eliminated (condition 4), subjects were unable to discriminate even the largest difference presented (13degrees). The results suggest that this sensory task is truly an integrative task drawing on sensory information from two different submodalities and so, following the definition of Gibson, is haptic in nature. The results are discussed in relation to the potential neural mechanisms that might underlie a task that requires integration across two anatomically separate body parts and two distinct modalities.

Clinical studies and animal models suggest that SMA is a developmental defect in neuromuscular interaction; however, the role of SMN in this process remains unclear. In the present study, we have determined the subcellular localization of SMN during retinoic-acid-induced neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonal teratocarcinoma P19 cells as well as in skeletal muscle during the critical period of neuromuscular maturation. We demonstrate, for the first time, SMN accumulation in growth-cone- and filopodia-like structures in both neuronal- and glial-like cells, identifying SMN as a new growth cone marker. Indeed, SMN was present at the leading edge of neurite outgrowths, suggesting that SMN may play a role in this process. In addition, SMN was detected as small dot-like particles within the cytoplasm of skeletal muscle during the first 2 weeks after birth, but their number peaked by P6. Intense SMN staining in neuromuscular junctions was observed throughout the entire postnatal period examined. Taken together, these results suggest that SMN may indeed fulfill neuronal- and muscle-specific functions, providing a more plausible mechanism explaining motor neuron degeneration and associated denervation atrophy of skeletal muscles in SMA. The primary SMA pathology most likely initiates in the peripheral axon - the result of deficient neurite outgrowth and/or neuromuscular maturation.

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients received carboplatin 560 mg/m(2) intravenously every 4 weeks for 1 year after maximum tumor response or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results: Between October 1993 and October 2000, 81 children (median age, 79 months, range, 6 to 204) were enrolled onto this study. Patients received a median of 11 cycles of carboplatin (range, one to 29). Median follow-up from the time of enrollment was 55 months (range, 10 to 93). The overall objective response (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + minor response [MR]) and disease stabilization (CR + PR + stable disease + MR) rates to carboplatin treatment were 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18% to 38%) and 85% (95% CI, 74% to 93%), respectively. Eleven and 14 patients suffered progressive disease on study and after stopping therapy, respectively. Toxicity was predominantly myelosuppression and included grade 3/4 neutropenia in 56 patients and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia in 40 patients. The 3-year failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients were 64% (95% CI, 54% to 76%) and 84% (95% CI, 76% to 93%), respectively. Patients with diencephalic tumors had inferior FFS and OS compared with those with tumor at other sites (38% v 74% for FFS, P = .011; 54% v 91% for OS, P = .004). Neurofibromatosis type 1 patients with progressive low-grade glioma had a significantly better OS (95% v 80%; P = .052). Conclusion: Carboplatin, in the schedule used in this study, produced disease stabilization or improvement in a majority of children with progressive low-grade glioma, with manageable toxicity. Improved treatment strategies are particularly required for patients with diencephalic tumors. (C) 2002 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Activation of AMPA receptors, in the presence of cyclothiazide to selectively block desensitization, produced a massive Ca2+ influx and cytotoxicity which were blocked by the antagonists CNQX and GYKI 52466. A role for free radical generation in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell death was deduced from three observations: (i) treatment with AMPA agonists decreased intracellular glutathione; (ii) depletion of intracellular glutathione with buthionine sulfoximine potentiated cell death; and (iii) the antioxidant N -acetylcysteine replenished intracellular glutathione and protected cultures from AMPA receptor-mediated toxicity. Cell death displayed some characteristics of apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation and activation of caspase-3 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). A substrate of calpain and caspase-3, alpha-spectrin, was cleaved into characteristic products following treatment with AMPA agonists. In contrast, inhibition of either caspase-3 by DEVD-CHO or calpain by PD 150606 protected cells from excitotoxicity. Our results indicate that overactivation of AMPA receptors causes apoptosis in oligodendrocyte progenitors through mechanisms involving Ca2+ influx, depletion of glutathione, and activation of JNK, calpain, and caspase-3.

These prior studies suggest that eye movements lag head movements, as predicted by a 7-ms delay in the VOR reflex pathways. However, Minor and colleagues recently applied whole-body rotations of frequencies less than or equal to15 Hz in monkeys and found that eye movements were nearly in phase with head motion across all frequencies. The goal of the present study was to determine whether VOR response dynamics actually differ significantly for whole-body versus head-on-body rotations. To address this question, we evaluated the gain and phase of the VOR induced by high-frequency oscillations of the head on the body in monkeys by directly measuring both head and eye movements using the magnetic search coil technique. A torque motor was used to rotate the heads of three Rhesus monkeys over the frequency range 5-25 Hz. Peak head velocity was held constant, first at +/-50degrees/s and then +/-100degrees/s. The VOR was found to be essentially compensatory across all frequencies; gains were near unity (1.1 at 5 Hz vs. 1.2 at 25 Hz), and phase lag increased only slightly with frequency (from 2degrees at 5 Hz to 11degrees at 25 Hz, a marked contrast to the 63degrees lag at 25 Hz predicted by a 7-ms VOR latency). Furthermore, VOR response dynamics were comparable in darkness and when viewing a target and did not vary with peak velocity. Although monkeys offered less resistance to the initial cycles of applied head motion, the gain and phase of the VOR did not vary for early versus late cycles, suggesting that an efference copy of the motor command to the neck musculature did not alter VOR response dynamics. In addition, VOR dynamics were also probed by applying transient head perturbations with much greater accelerations (peak acceleration >15,000degrees/s(2)) than have been previously employed. The VOR latency was between 5 and 6 ms, and mean gain was close to unity for two of the three animals tested. A simple linear model well described the VOR responses elicited by sinusoidal and transient head on body rotations. We conclude that the VOR is compensatory over a wide frequency range in monkeys and has similar response dynamics during passive rotation of the head on body as during passive rotation of the whole body in space.

Human imaging studies demonstrate activation of SI and SII associated with painful stimuli, but results have been variable, and the functional relevance of any such activation is uncertain. The present study addresses this issue by testing whether the time course of somatosensory activation, evoked by painful heat and nonpainful tactile stimuli, is sufficient to discriminate temporal differences that characterize the perception of these stimulus modalities. Four normal subjects each participated in three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions, in which painful (noxious heat 45-46degreesC) and nonpainful test stimuli (brushing at 2 Hz) were applied repeatedly (9-s stimulus duration) to the left leg in separate experiments. Activation maps were generated comparing painful to neutral heat (35degreesC) and nonpainful brushing to rest. Directed searches were performed in SI and SII for sites reliably activated by noxious heat and brush stimuli, and stimulus-dependent regions of interest (ROI) were then constructed for each subject. The time course, per stimulus cycle, was extracted from these ROIs and compared across subjects, stimulus modalities, and cortical regions. Both innocuous brushing and noxious heat produced significant activation within contralateral SI and SII. The time course of brush-evoked responses revealed a consistent single peak of activity, approximately 10 s after the onset of the stimulus, which rapidly diminished upon stimulus withdrawal. In contrast, the response to heat pain in both SI and SII was characterized by a double-peaked time course in which the maximum response (the 2nd peak) was consistently observed similar to17 s after the onset of the stimulus (8 s following termination of the stimulus). This prolonged period of activation paralleled the perception of increasing pain intensity that persists even after stimulus offset. On the other hand, the temporal profile of the initial minor peak in pain-related activation closely matched that of the brush-evoked activity, suggesting a possible relationship to tactile components of the thermal stimulation procedure. These data indicate that both SI and SII cortices are involved in the processing of nociceptive information and are consistent with a role for these structures in the perception of temporal aspects of pain intensity.

In the present experiments, we investigated the effects of blockade of beta-NA adrenoceptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and in the region of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) on footshock- and cocaine-induced reinstatement. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) for 9 d and, after a 5-7 d drug-free period, were given extinction sessions followed by a test for footshock stress-induced (15 min of intermittent footshock, 0.8 mA) or cocaine- induced (20 mg/kg, i.p.) reinstatement. Before the test, different groups of rats were given bilateral infusions of one of four doses of a mixture of the beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptor antagonists betaxolol and ICI-118,551 (vehicle, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 nmol of each compound in 0.5 mul) into either the BNST or CeA. We observed a dose-dependent reduction of stress-induced reinstatement after infusions into the BNST and a complete blockade of stress-induced reinstatement after infusions into the CeA at all doses tested. The same treatments did not block cocaine- induced reinstatement when given at either site. These data suggest that stress-induced NA activation in the BNST and in the region of the CeA is critical to relapse to drug seeking induced by stress but not to relapse induced by priming injections of cocaine, and we hypothesize that NA activity leads to activation of corticotropin-releasing factor neurons in these regions.

Study design: Eligible infants (n = 131) <2 years of age requiring open heart surgery were recruited prospectively. Subjects were assessed during surgery and again 12 to 18 months later with standardized developmental assessments and formal neurologic examinations. Results: Mean age at follow-up testing was 19.1 +/- 6.6 months. Assessments indicated that 41% had abnormal neurologic examinations. Gross and/or fine motor delays were documented in 42%, and 23% demonstrated global developmental delay. Univariate and multiple regression models identified the following factors increasing the risk for persistent developmental deficits: preoperative and acute postoperative neurodevelopmental status and microcephaly, type of heart lesion, length of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, age at surgery, and days in the intensive care unit (P < .05). Conclusions: Children with congenital heart defects commonly have ongoing neurologic, motor, and developmental deficits well after surgical correction. The cause is multifactorial and includes brain injury before, during, and after heart surgery. (J Pediatr 2002;141:51-8).

H-2',6'-dimethyltyrosine-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2 ([Dmt(1)]DALDA) has extraordinary selectivity for mu-receptors (K-i(delta)/K-i(mu) > 14,000). Daily administration of [Dmt(1)]DALDA (5 times ED50; s. c.) for 7 days increased ED50 3.6-fold from 0.16 to 0.58 mumol/kg. A higher dose of [Dmt(1)]DALDA (10 times ED50, every 12 h) for 2.5 days resulted in a 11.7 times increase in the ED50 (1.9 mumol/kg). Complete cross-tolerance to morphine was observed, with a 3.4- and 15.1-fold shift in the morphine ED50, respectively. We also compared the extent of spinal versus supraspinal tolerance after repeated s. c. [Dmt(1)]DALDA administration. Five doses of [Dmt(1)]DALDA (10 times ED50, every 12 h) resulted in a 3.4 times shift in the i.c.v. ED50 (15.4 versus 4.6 pmol/mouse) but a 44 times shift in the i.t. ED50 (52.9 versus 1.2 pmol/mouse). Tolerance to [Dmt(1)]DALDA was associated with 30 to 35% reduction in [H-3][Dmt(1)]DALDA binding in brain and spinal cord. Coadministration of [Dmt(1)]DALDA with delta-antagonist naltriben (NTB) reduced spinal tolerance by 50%. Even after spinal tolerance had been established, addition of a delta-antagonist (NTB or H-Tyr-TicPsi[CH2NH] Phe-Phe-OH) significantly enhanced the potency of i.t. [Dmt(1)]DALDA 2- to 4-fold. These results suggest that agonist activation of delta-receptors is not necessary for the development of opioid tolerance; however, delta-receptors play a modulatory role in the maintenance of the tolerant state.

Evidence from animal studies suggests that drug therapy may act on specific transcription factors and target genes that regulate processes such as neuroprotection and neuronal survival. Clinical studies consistently identify changes in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala that may be related to the course of illness and may be prevented with successful treatment. Together, these findings suggest that clinically relevant neurobiological correlations may ultimately be identified in patients who respond and remit to treatment.

J	Al-Twaijri, WA; Shevell, MI				Al-Twaijri, WA; Shevell, MI			A novel chronic childhood sensory predominant neuropathy	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article							AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; ETIOLOGIC YIELD; HEREDITARY; CHILDREN	Chronic childhood neuropathies are predominantly hereditary in origin. Specific distinct clinical entities have been described, however, occasionally children with an unusual clinical phenotype are encountered in practice. We describe four children (3 males, I female) of Lebanese Moslem descent all sharing a common great-great-grandparent pairing with such a novel clinical spectrum. The three males were first cousins, each the product of a different parental consanguineous (i.e., parents second cousins) mating, whereas the female was a third cousin to each of the males whose parents were also second cousins. Each child presented early in life with developmental delay with associated hypotonia and areflexia. All had a sensorineural hearing loss documented and two of the patients were dysmorphic in facial appearance. Nerve conduction studies highlighted a sensory axonal neuropathy and sural nerve biopsy undertaken in two patients confirmed an axonal neuropathy. Detailed genetic and metabolic testing was negative. Followed into later childhood, each child continued to manifest motoric impairment, unsteadiness, areflexia, and cognitive disability. These children appear to provide evidence for a novel autosomal recessive inherited chronic predominantly sensory neuropathy that shares core clinical features with observed variability in associated symptoms.

Neuropathologic evaluation in these disorders reveals characteristic alterations of astrocyte morphology ranging from cell swelling (acute hyperammonemia) to Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis (chronic hyperammonemia). Having no effective urea cycle, brain relies on glutamine systhesis for the removal of excess ammonia and the enzyme responsible, glutamine synthetase, has a predominantly astrocytic localization. Accumulation of ammonia in brain results in a redistribution of cerebral blood flow and metabolism from cortical to sub-cortical structures. In addition to changes in astrocyte morphology, increased brain ammonia concentrations result in alterations in expression of key astrocyte proteins including glial fibrillary acidic protein, glutamate and glycine transporters and "peripheral-type" (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors. Such changes result in alterations of astrocytic volume and increased extracellular concentrations of excitatory and inhibitory substances. In addition, the ammonium ion has direct effects on excitatory-inhibitory transmission via distinct mechanisms involving cellular chloride extrusion and postsynaptic receptor function. Acute ammonia exposure leads to activation of NMDA receptors and their signal transduction pathways. Chronic hyperammonemia also results in increased concentrations of neuroactive L-tryptophan metabolites including serotonin and quinolinic acid. Therapy in hyperammonemic syndromes continues to rely on ammonia-lowering strategies via peripheral mechanisms (reduction of ammonia production in the gastrointestinal tract, increased ammonia removal by muscle).

Hypoxia-induced neuropeptide release may increase receptor endocytosis, reducing receptor accessibility to ligands. We wondered whether the attenuated respiratory response to hypoxia of developing piglets after single (Respir. Physiol. 92 (1993a) 115) or repeated daily hypoxic exposure (J. Appl. Physiol. 83 (1997) 522) is influenced by differential endocytosis of NK-1 vs mu-opioid receptors. Whereas the long-term (24 h) response of both receptors to recurrent hypoxia in piglet brainstem is similar, i.e. upregulation, the short-term (5 min) response to single or recurrent hypoxia, albeit in rats, is different: radiolabelled NK-1 receptors are greatly reduced, suggesting enhanced endocytosis, but mu-opioid receptors remain unchanged, implying unaltered endocytosis. If confirmed in piglet brainstem, this difference would produce relatively more available mu-opioid receptors to opioid peptides in hypoxia that might contribute to the attenuated respiratory responses to single and repeated hypoxia during development.

Two neural network schemes are presented. In the first scheme, the controller is composed of a stabilizing joint PD controller and a neural network tracking controller. The objective is to simultaneously achieve hub-position tracking and control of the elastic deflections at the tip. In the second scheme, tracking control of a point along the arm is considered to avoid difficulties associated with the output feedback control of a non-minimum phase flexible manipulator. A separate neural network is employed for determining an appropriate output to be used for feedback. The controller is also composed of a neural network tracking controller and a stabilizing joint PD controller. Experimental results on a single-link flexible manipulator show that the proposed networks result in significant improvements in the system response with an increase in controller dynamic range despite changes in the desired trajectory.

This study investigated the relationships between personality and symptom dimensions in schizophrenia patients. Fifty-two schizophrenia patients and 25 five healthy subjects were assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). The patients were also assessed for positive and negative symptoms using SAPS and SANS and scored according to Andreasen's (1995: Andreasen, N.C., Arndt, S., Alliger, R., Miller, D., Flaum, M. 1995. Symptoms of schizophrenia. Methods, meanings, and mechanisms. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 52, 341-351) classical three dimensional model and by the five dimensional model of Toomey et al. (1997: Toomey, R., Kremen, W.S., Simpson J.C., Samson, J.A., Seidman, L.J., Lyons, MJ., Faraone, S.V., Tsuang, M.T. 1997. Revisiting the factor structure for positive and negative symptoms: evidence from a large heterogeneous group of psychiatric patients. Am. J. Psychiatry, 154, 371-377). Comparisons between patients and controls revealed significant differences on various TO scores consistent with a global disorganization of personality in schizophrenia involving both basic neurophysiological and potentially genetically determined traits (i.e. temperament) and developmental aspects of personality (i.e. character). Correlation analysis showed distinct associations between symptoms and personality dimensions. The results suggest that the negative and disorganized dimensions of schizophrenia are related temperamental factors, whereas the psychotic symptoms are more related to characterological abnormalities. The observed patterns of associations also underline the heterogeneity of the classical negative and positive dimensions of schizophrenia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

BACKGROUND Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition constitutes a major advance in the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF). Simultaneous inhibition of both neutral endopeptidase and ACE with omapatrilat may represent a new treatment strategy in CHF. METHODS Three hundred and sixty-nine patients with symptomatic heart failure were randomized to double-blind treatment with omapatrilat (first 190 patients: 2.5 mg, 5 mg or 10 mg; last 179 patients: 2.5 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg once daily) for 12 weeks. RESULTS Acutely, the 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 rug doses of omapatrilat produced greater reductions in pulmonary capillary, wedge pressure (PCWP), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and systemic vascular resistance compared with 2.5 mg. Higher doses were associated with greater increases in vasodilator and natriuretic peptides, in addition to ACE inhibition. After 12 weeks, omapatrilat 20 mg and 40 mg showed greater fills from baseline in PCWP (40 mg: 0 h to 12 h average change -7.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg) and SBP (40 mg: -11.7 +/- 1.7 min Hg) than 2.5 mg (both p < 0.01 vs. 2.5 mg). The incidence of adverse experiences and patient withdrawal were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS In CHF, the acute hemodynamic benefit seen with higher doses of omapatrilat was associated with increases in plasma vasodilator and natriuretic peptide levels in addition to ACE inhibition. After 12 weeks, the hemodynamic benefit was maintained. Omapatrilat may be a promising new agent in CHF.

Methods: The volume of the entorhinal cortices of 22 control subjects and 18 patients with neuroleptic-naive first-episode schizophrenia were measured from magnetic resonance images (MRI) scans using recently designed anatomic criteria for MRI anatomy of the entorhinal cortex. Results: Smaller entorhinal volumes were found bilaterally in the schizophrenic patients. This volume loss did not correlate with items on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Conclusions: These data suggest early involvement of the entorhinal cortex in schizophrenia.

We show here by RNA gel shift assays, immunoprecipitation, and by a novel in situ hybridization immunohistochemical technique that TB-RBP binds to AKAP4 mRNA in male mouse germ cells. AKAP4 is a component of the fibrous sheath and functions as a scaffolding protein in the sperm flagellum. AKAP4 is encoded by an X-linked gene, is expressed solely in postmeiotic (haploid) male germ cells, and is an essential protein in all spermatozoa, requiring its transport between spermatids as a protein or mRNA. AKAP4 mRNA forms a complex with TB-RBP and the Ter ATPase in nuclei and remains associated with these proteins as it exits nuclei into the cytoplasm and as it passes through intercellular bridges between spermatids. A similar mRNA-TB-RBP-Ter ATPase association is seen for protamine 2 mRNA, which is stored in the cytoplasm of postmeiotic germ cells about 7 days before translation. In contrast, no association is seen with PGK-2 mRNA which is initially transcribed early in meiosis with increased transcription in postmeiotic male germ cells. Although PGK-2 mRNA is subject to translational control, it lacks TB-RBP-binding sequences in its mRNA. The AKAP4 or protamine 2 mRNA-protein complexes dissociate in late-stage male germ cells when the mRNAs are translated. We propose that TB-RBP and the Ter ATPase are part of a complex that accompanies specific mRNAs in haploid mouse male germ cells in intracellular and intercellular movement. The temporal relationship of TB-RBP binding and mRNA inactivation in conjunction with the subsequent dissociation of the mRNA-protein complex at the time of mRNA translation suggests a role in translational suppression and/or mRNA stabilization.

We have identified in the upstream sequence of its gene a conserved domain partially homologous to the repressor element RE1/NRSE found in several genes for neuronal proteins, RE1/NRSE binds the silencing transcription factor REST/NRSF, a nuclear protein primarily found in nonneuronal cells. To determine the functionality of the PC2 gene RE1-like sequence (RE1-lk), we examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays its ability to attach nuclear factors from PC2-expressing and nonexpressing cells. Specific binding factors were mostly detectable in PC2-non-expressing cells. These factors differ from REST/NRSF, as molar excess of competing RE1/NRSE could not prevent their binding to REI-1k, Reciprocally. molar excess of RE1-lk could not prevent the binding of RE1/NRSE to the DNA-binding domain of a recombinant REST/NRSF. The presence of RE1-lk in cis reduced the ability of the PC2 promoter and the heterologous phosphoglycerate kinase promoter to drive expression of a green fluorescent protein reporter gene in transiently transfected PC2-nonexpressing cells, but not in PC2-expressing cells. These observations suggest that binding of transcription-silencing factors to the RE1-lk element may contribute to repression of the PC2 gene in nonneuroendocrine cells.

Design: Procedural skill learning was assessed using Mirror Tracing and Rotary Pursuit skill learning tasks. Subjects also completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Setting: Cognitive testing was performed during the day following the second of two consecutive nights during which sleep and respiratory variables were recorded. Participants: Two groups (28 OSAS patients and 18 normal controls) with equivalent mean age and education levels. Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: No significant differences in learning rates were observed between the groups on the Rotary Pursuit Task. On the Mirror Tracing Task, overall learning of the skill and transfer to a new figure or to the reverse tracing direction was similar in the OSAS and NC groups. However, there was a subgroup of OSAS subjects (n=11) who showed marked difficulties in the initial acquisition of the Mirror Tracing Task. This subgroup's performance was no longer significantly different from that of controls and OSAS subjects without initial adaptation difficulty in the subsequent trials. Performance of subjects who had difficulty with initial adaptation on the Mirror Tracing was also significantly lower on tests of frontal executive function, but not on episodic memory tests. Sleep and respiratory variables did not distinguish between the two subgroups of OSAS patients. However, none of the young OSAS subjects (<40 years) presented this deficit, Conclusion: Results indicate that contrary to this study's hypothesis, OSAS patients did not show procedural skill learning deficits. A subgroup of OSAS patients, however, did show deficits in initial skill adaptation and difficulties on other neuropsychological tests. Frontal dysfunction and decrement in psychomotor efficiency and vigilance appeared to be the most consistent explanation for characterizing the profile of neuropsychological test results among the OSAS patients.

Here, we show that neuronal activity, mediated by electrical stimulation, KCl depolarization, or cholinergic receptor activation, promotes reversible dendrite formation in sympathetic neurons and that this effect is enhanced by NGF. Activity-dependent dendrite formation is accompanied by increased association of HMW MAP2 with microtubules and increased microtubule stability. Inhibition of either CaMKII or the MEK-ERK pathway, both of which phosphorylate MAP2, inhibits dendrite formation, but inhibition of both pathways simultaneously is required for dendrites to retract. These data indicate that neuronal activity signals via CamKII and the ERKs to regulate MAP2:microtubule interactions and hence reversible dendrite stability, and to provide a mechanism whereby activity and neurotrophins converge intracellularly to dynamically regulate dendritic morphology.

Given the rarity of most serious adverse effects, a case-control approach will often be chosen. This paper discusses aspects of the design, analysis and interpretation of case-control studies to evaluate vaccine adverse effects. Potential biases (and how to minimise such biases) in the selection of cases and assessment of vaccine exposure and the potential for confounding are discussed. Finally the increasing use of electronic databases in the evaluation of vaccine adverse effects is considered. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

This betabeta-enolase differs at eight positions from that sequenced by Chin (17). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change residue 414 from glutamate to leucine, thereby abolishing a salt bridge involved in subunit contacts. Recombinant wild-type and mutant enolase were purified from E. coli and compared to enolase isolated from rabbit muscle. Molecular weights were determined by mass spectrometry. All three betabeta-enolases had similar kinetics, and UV and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The mutant enolase was far more sensitive to inactivation by pressure, by KCI or EDTA, and by sodium Perchlorate. We confirmed, by analytical ultracentrifugation, that the sodium perchlorate inactivation was due to dissociation. DeltaG(o) for dissociation of enolase was decreased from 49.7 kJ/mol for the wild-type enzyme to 42.3 kJ/mol for the mutant. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, perchlorate inactivation of E414L was accompanied by a small loss of secondary structure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Data sources: Search through Medline((R)) database of articles published in French and English since 1966. Also use of other publications such as books on cannabis. Study selection: All the relevant documents within the theme of this review were used. Data extraction: All the data linked to the present topic were searched. Data synthesis: Recent advances have dramatically increased our understanding of cannabinoid pharmacology. The psychoactive constituents of Cannabis sativa have been isolated, synthetic cannabinoids described and an endocannabinoid system identified, together with its component receptors and ligands. Strong laboratory evidence now underwrites anecdotal claims of cannabinoid analgesia in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Sites of analgesic action have been identified in brain, spinal cord and the periphery, with the latter two presenting attractive targets for divorcing the analgesic and psychotrophic effects of cannabinoids. Clinical trials are now required, but are hindered by a paucity of cannabinoids of suitable bioavailability and therapeutic ratio. Conclusion: The cannabinoid system is a major target in the treatment of pain and its therapeutic potential should be assessed in the near future by the performance of new clinical trials.

The present investigation employed a lexical decision task to assess whether left (LHD) and right hemisphere damaged (RHD) patients are similarly sensitive to stress patterns in lexical access. The results confirmed that individuals without brain damage are influenced by stress patterns, as indicated by increased lexical decision latencies to incorrectly stressed word and nonword stimuli. The data for the LHD patients revealed an effect of stress for real word targets only, whereas the reaction time data for the RHD patients as a group showed no significant influence of stress pattern. However, there was a great deal of individual variability in performance. The latency and error rate findings suggest that LHD patients and non-brain-damaged individuals are both sensitive to lexical stress in word recognition, but the LHD patients are more likely to treat incorrectly stressed items as nonwords. The results are discussed in relation to theories of the hemispheric lateralization of prosodic processing and the role of lexical stress in word recognition.

Objective: To examine the correlation between regional cerebral metabolic alterations measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and neuropsychological dysfunctions in patients with early AD. Design: A case-control study. Setting: University hospital neurology clinic and radilyology department. Participants: A cohort of 14 patients with mild AD and 14 control subjects paired for age and sex. Interventions: Single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic brain examination (60 minutes) and a comprehensive battery of psychometric tests (2 hours). Main Outcome Measures: Metabolite ratios relative to unsuppressed water were calculated for magnetic resonance spectroscopic metabolites (N-acetylaspartate, choline, creatine-phosphocreatine, and myo-inositol) in the medial temporal lobes (MTLs), parietotemporal cortices (PTCs), and frontal cortices of both hemispheres. Correlations were examined between metabolic changes in an area and psychometric scores of its known regional function: MTL and verbal memory, PTC and language and visuoconstructional abilities, and frontal cortices and executive functions. Results: A significant reduction of N-acetylaspartate/ water (H(2)O) in the left MTL and of choline/H(2)O in both MTLs, as well as a significant increase of myo-inositol/ H(2)O in the right PTC were observed. Metabolic alterations in the left MTL were correlated with a loss of verbal memory, in the left PTC with language impairment, and in the right PTC with a loss of visuoconstructional abilities in the group with AD. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with regional distribution of neuropathologic changes and cognitive symptoms characterizing early phases of AD, and with the pattern of lateralization of normal brain function.

Methods: participants were selected using a random stratified sampling procedure. Self-administered questionnaires provided data on alcohol consumption, sociodemographics, medical history, and lifestyle. Mood states were assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and risk for AUD was surveyed using a behavioral screening questionnaire and categorized into no, low, and high risk. Of 297 participants, 253 current drinkers who had responded to all questions on alcohol use were retained. Results: Psychologic distress increased with risk for AUD and alcohol consumption greater than or equal to 420 g/week. Higher MnB levels (greater than or equal to7.5 mug/L) intensified the relation between risk for AUD and BSI settle scores. The prevalence odd ratios for positive cases of psychologic distress with risk for AUD, 1.98 [1.13-3.46], differed Amen divided by MnB strata: lower MnB: 1.34 [0.64-2.85]; higher MnB: 4.22 [1.65-10.77].

The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of implementation of an integrated TBI programme on patient-care. The research design was a retrospective institutional review for which 1875 patient records were reviewed, healthcare professionals were interviewed, patient care was observed, and a literature review of the prognostic variables for mild, moderate and severe TBI was conducted. The implementation of an integrated TBI programme has reduced the average length of stay from 30.5 to 12 days and resulted in tremendous cost savings of $21.8 million over 6 years. 'Blueprinting' the continuum of TBI patients' care identified the weakest links to be the transfer of patients from the tertiary-care TBI programme to rehabilitation institutions and provision of long-term rehabilitative care due to information asymmetry. This was addressed by the development of comprehensive on-line TBI transfer documents. This study emphasizes the importance of comprehensive neurotrauma programmes.

Intracerebroventricular injection of 1 mug of the hormone in 1 mul of physiological solution 2 min before tetanization produced a significant decrease in both components of the perforant path evoked potentials (EP) in the DG. The effects appeared right after the tetanization stimuli and were more pronounced in the excitatory postsynaptic components of the EPs. The decrements lasted for the 2 h of, recording time. We concluded that OT induced and maintained long-term depression on the DG. In contrast, injection of OT in the absence of tetanic stimulation did not significantly affect perforant path EP in the DG. The results are discussed taking particular consideration of the inhibitory effects the OT has on (Ca2+ + Mg2+) ATPase at membrane levels and the potential interference that this action may have with phosphorylation processes via an ectoprotein kinase isolated from membranes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Blocking of this ectoprotein. kinase in vitro significantly impairs establishment and maintenance of LTP. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Objective: The goal of this study was to conduct a best-evidence synthesis of data on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of donepezil and rivastigmine in the treatment of AD. Methods: Relevant published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Phase IV open-label extension studies (excluding abstracts) were identified through searches of MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, and PsycINFO for the period January 1984 to October 2001. The bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for additional publications. For inclusion in the best-evidence synthesis, clinical trials had to pass a blinded quality assessment (score greater than or equal to5 on the Jadad scale) and use National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disease and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association diagnostic criteria. Economic studies were selected using National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination criteria for reporting critical summaries of economic evaluations. Results: Nine RCTs of donepezil and 2 of rivasti-inine were identified and met inclusion criteria for the best-evidence synthesis. Eight donepezil trials and both rivastigmine trials included patients with mild AD (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score, 15-27) or moderate AD (MMSE score, 8-14); 1 donepezil trial included patients with moderate or severe AD (MMSE score, 0-7). In the RCTs of donepezil, the mean decrease in scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) was greater with active treatment than with placebo (lower scores indicate less cognitive deterioration). In the RCTs of rivastigmine, ADAS-cog scores decreased over the follow-up period with both active treatment and placebo; however, scores decreased more with active treatment. Three Phase IV studies of donepezil and I Phase IV study of rivastigmine were identified. Their results were consistent with those of the RCTs. Ten economic studies (7 donepezil, 3 rivastigmine) were identified and reviewed. In 4 of the donepezil studies and all 3 rivastigmine studies, use of the drug cost less than a no-drug strategy. Conclusions: The efficacy data indicate that both donepezil and rivastigmine can delay cognitive impairment and deterioration in global health for at least 6 months in patients with mild to moderate AD. Patients receiving active treatment will have more favorable ADAS-cog scores for at least 6 months, after which their scores will begin to converge with those of patients receiving placebo. Differences in methodology, types of direct or indirect costs included, and sources of cost data made it difficult to compare and synthesize findings of the economic studies; therefore, the cost-effectiveness data are inconclusive.

His impairment was observed across tasks (naming, definition, matching, drawing from memory, questionnaires), input modalities (visual, verbal, nonverbal auditory), and output modalities (verbal vs. pointing or visual matching responses) as well as for different types of knowledge. Although visual knowledge of living things was severely affected, his category-specific impairment in nonverbal sound recognition is inconsistent with models of category-specific deficits based on pre-semantic visual descriptions. ER's deficit cannot fully be explained by item typicality, word frequency, visual complexity, homomorphy, age of acquisition, value to perceiver, or modality of transaction. Furthermore, in ER, contextual cues were even slightly detrimental for the recognition of animals. ER's naming and recognition errors were constrained by the categorical structure of the knowledge base: In most cases they respected both the second- and first-order superordinates. In particular, ER's knowledge of shared categorical properties related to biological function was almost spared. This result is compatible with the idea that, for living things, shared functional properties and shared perceptual properties are strongly correlated. Feature-based models assuming perceptual vs. functional semantic components cannot account for ER's deficit, since for living things he was impaired on both kinds of features to a similar extent. ER's behaviour is quite consistent with the notion that conceptual knowledge is organised categorically in the brain, with one or several specialised subsystems for biologically related entities.

J	Kar, S				Kar, S			Role of amyloid beta peptides in the regulation of central cholinergic function and its relevance to Alzheimer's disease pathology	DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH			English	Review						acetylcholine; amyloids; degenerative disorders; neurodegeneration; neuromodulation	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; RAT HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; PRECURSOR PROTEIN SECRETION; TAU-PHOSPHORYLATION; TRANSGENIC MICE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SENILE DEMENTIA; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CORTICAL-NEURONS; IN-VIVO	The neuropathological features associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain include the presence of extracellular neuritic plaques composed of amyloid beta protein (Abeta), intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and the loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that innervate regions such as the hippocampus and the cortex. Studies of the pathological changes that characterize AD and several other lines of evidence indicate that Abeta accumulation in vivo may initiate and/or contribute to the process of neurodegeneration and thereby the development of AD. However, the mechanisms by which Abeta peptide influences/causes degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and/or the cognitive impairment characteristic of AD remain obscure. A number of recent studies indicate that physiological concentrations of soluble alphabeta-related peptides, under acute conditions, can negatively regulate various steps of acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and release without inducing any apparent toxicity, suggesting a possible neuromodulatory role for the peptide in the regulation of central cholinergic functions. Chronic exposure to muM concentrations of Abeta peptides, on the other hand, evokes toxicity in cholinergic neurons, possibly via hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Activation of selected cholinergic receptors has been shown to influence the processing of amyloid precursor protein as well as modulation of tau phosphorylation. More recently, a direct interaction between nicotinic ACh receptor and Abeta peptides have been demonstrated using a variety of approaches. This review focuses on the role of alphabeta-related peptides in the regulation of function/survival of central cholinergic neurons and its relevance to the cholinergic deficits observed in AD brains.

J	Poirier, J				Poirier, J			Evidence that the clinical effects of cholinesterase inhihitors are related to potency and targeting of action	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						butyrylcholinesterase; donepezil; galantamine; potency; rivastigmine; tacrine; targeted efficacy	BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE-K VARIANT; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID-ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CONFIRMED ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND; NICOTINIC RECEPTORS; SELECTIVE-INHIBITION; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM	Since degenerative alterations associated with cholinergic changes in the brains of demented patients occur in specific regions, optimal efficacy may be achieved by targeting the actions of potent cholinesterase inhibitors in relevant regions. When evaluating the activities of these agents, only cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based studies in demented patients provide reliable data. Preclinical or healthy volunteer studies of cholinesterase inhibitory activity using plasma or erythrocytes as an enzyme source are inconclusive due to differences between enzymes, their relative activities, and the profiles of their isoforms from different sources, with additional changes during disease progression. Tacrine and rivastigmine inhibit both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in the CSF of Alzheimer's disease patients. Both enzymes are involved in the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain and dual inhibition may lead to greater, broader efficacy, as well as a greater potential for disease modification. However, potent and rapid elevation in levels of ACh may also induce more acute tolerability problems, such as nausea and vomiting. Only rivastigmine appears to show brain region-selectivity, particularly for regions involved in attention and behaviour and that are known to degenerate during the progression of various dementia types. This selectivity is due to preferential inhibition of the G1 form of AChE and, probably, also BuChE. Cholinesterase inhibitors that lack preferential selectivity for particular isoforms may provide less targeted actions. This may explain the relatively higher incidences of certain peripheral side effects observed during maintenance treatment with some of these drugs. All cholinesterase inhibitors interact via ACh, additionally available due to enzyme inhibition, with nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (nAChRs and mAChRs). Allosteric modulation of a presynaptic nAChR has been shown in vitro with many of these agents, and it has been proposed, but not demonstrated, that this may result in an increased release and potentiation of ACh in the brain. The clinical relevance of this mechanism is unknown. The rapidly reversible actions of donepezil, tacrine and galantamine may lead to tolerance due to their ability to upregulate target enzyme activities; however upregulation is not seen with the slowly reversible (pseudo-irreversible) inhibitor rivastigmine. Available clinical data support the hypothesis that potent, slowly reversible inhibitors of AChE and BuChE targeted to the G1 isoforms may lead to greater, broader and more sustained benefits. However, further investigation of the cholinesterase inhibitors to elucidate more definitely the clinical consequences of their differing pharmacological properties is required.

Imidazoline receptors were immunolocalized in the rat heart. Membrane binding and autoradiography on frozen heart sections using 0.5 rim para-iodoclonidine (I-125-PIC) revealed that binding was equally and concentration-dependently inhibited by epinephrine and imidazole-4-acetic acid (IAA), implying I-125-PIC binding to cardiac alpha2-adrenergic and I1-receptors, respectively. After irreversible blockade of a2-adrenergic receptors, binding was inhibited by the selective I1-agonist, moxonidine, and the I1-antagonist, efaroxan, in a concentration-dependent (10(-12) to 10(-5) M) manner. Calculation of kinetic parameters revealed that in canine left and right atria, I1-receptor Bmax was 13.4 +/- 1.7 and 20.1 +/- 3.0 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Compared to age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats, I1-receptors were increased in 12-week-old hypertensive rat (SHR) right (22.6 +/- 0.3 to 43.7 +/- 4.4 fmol/unit area, p < 0.01) and left atria (13.3 +/- 0.6 to 30.2 +/- 4.1 fmol/unit area, p < 0.01). Also, compared to corresponding normal controls, Bmax was increased in hearts of hamsters with advanced cardiomyopathy (13.9 +/- 0.4 to. 26.0 +/- 2.3 fmol/unit area, p < 0.01) and in human ventricles with heart failure (12.6 +/- 1.3 to 35.5 +/- 2.9 fmol/mg protein, p < 0.003). These studies demonstrate that the heart possesses imidazoline I1-receptors that are up-regulated in the presence of hypertension or heart failure, which would suggest their involvement in cardiovascular regulation.

To provide further information, clinical and biochemical information was obtained on women with maternal homocystinuria, on their pregnancies and on the offspring. This information included blood sulphur amino acids and total homocysteine, CbetaS gene mutations and developmental and cognitive scores in the offspring. The study involved 15 pregnancies in 11 women, of whom 5 were pyridoxine-nonresponsive and 6 were pyridoxine-responsive. Complications of pregnancy included pre-eclampsia at term in two pregnancies and superficial venous thrombosis of the leg in a third pregnancy. One pregnancy was terminated and two pregnancies resulted in first-trimester spontaneous abortions. The remaining 12 pregnancies produced live-born infants with normal or above-normal birth measurements. One offspring has multiple congenital anomalies that include colobomas of the iris and choroid, neural tube defect and undescended testes. He is also mentally retarded and autistic. A second offspring has Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The remaining 10 offspring were normal at birth and have remained normal. There was no relationship between the severity of the biochemical abnormalities or the therapies during pregnancy to either the pregnancy complications or the offspring outcomes. The infrequent occurrences of pregnancy complications, offspring abnormalities and maternal thromboembolic events in this series suggest that pregnancy and outcome in maternal homocystinuria are usually normal. Nevertheless, a cautious approach would include careful monitoring of these pregnancies with attention to metabolic therapy and possibly anticoagulation.

The firing frequency ranged from 20 Hz at 0degreesC to 200 Hz at 23degreesC. Above 23degreesC, the axons were quiescent. They were bistable for 13 < T < 23degreesC. That is, they were either quiescent or spontaneously firing. Below 13degreesC, spontaneous firing was the only stable element. The primary effects of changes in temperature on the underlying ionic currents were on gating of the delayed rectifier potassium channel I-K, and the sodium ion channel I-Na. The kinetics of I-K had a Q(10) of 3.63. The effect of T on I-Na was more complicated in that the peak I-Na amplitude increased with T, as demonstrated in earlier reports. This effect, as well as the changes in I-Na kinetics produced by changes in T, were mimicked in the context of a model of I-Na gating in which activation and inactivations are coupled. Electrical activity was simulated in a model of the action potential with appropriate temperature-dependent modifications for I-Na and I-K. The model predicts a change from monostability (spontaneous firing) at relatively low temperatures to bistability (quiescence and spontaneous firing) as the temperature is raised, followed by change back to monostability (quiescence) as the temperature is further increased, which is consistent with the experimental results.

Central application of NPY also reliably increases food intake in rats. States with heavy demands on energy resources where reproduction is also inhibited, such as lactation, are similarly accompanied by elevations in central NPY expression. In previous studies, we have shown that, compared to lactating rats fed ad libitum, food-restricted lactating rats exhibit a longer period of lactational diestrus that is correlated with increased central NPY expression. These studies link NPY to the inhibition of reproduction that is mediated by low availability of energy resources. Here, we examine the effect of chronic 7-day infusion of the mixed Y1/Y4/Y5 agonist (Leu(31), Pro(34) ) NPY and selective agonists to the Y2 (NPY13-36) and Y5 (D-Trp(32) NPY and D-Trp(34) NPY) receptors on food intake and the oestrous cycle of virgin female rats. We also investigated the effect of chronic infusion from day 8-15 postpartum (pp) of D-Trp(32) NPY and D-Trp(34) NPY on food-intake and the length of lactational diestrus in lactating rats fed ad libitum. In virgin females, infusion of (Leu(31), Pro(34)) NPY and both the Y5 agonists lengthened the period between consecutive oestrus days while the Y2 agonist NPY13-36 was without effect. Selective Y5 receptor activation alone caused an increase in food intake in virgin females. In lactating females, D-Trp(32) NPY extended the length of lactational diestrus, while D-Trp(34) NPY had no effect on this parameter. These data suggest that Y5 receptor activation suppresses the reproductive axis in both virgin and lactating rats and that Y5 receptor activation enhances food-intake in virgin females.

Since magnetization transfer (MT) imaging can detect focal abnormalities in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) before the appearance of lesions on conventional MRI, we hypothesized that changes in MT might be able to predict the clinical evolution of MS. We assessed MR data from MS patients who were subsequently followed clinically for 5 years. We computed the mean MT ratio (MT) in gray matter, in lesions identified on T2-weighted MRI, and in NAWM, as well as in a thick central brain slice for each patient. Patients were divided into stable and worsening groups according to their change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores over 5 years. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and odds ratio of the baseline MTr measures in order to assess their prognostic utility. We found significant differences in baseline MTr values in NAWM (p = 0.005) and brain slice (p = 0.03) between clinically stable and worsening MS patients. When these MTr values were compared with changes in EDSS over 5 years, a strong correlation was found between the EDSS changes and MTr values in both NAWM (SRCC = -0.76,p < 0.001) and in the brain slice (SRCC = 0.59, p = 0.01). Baseline NAWM MTr correctly predicted clinical evolution in 15/18 patients (1 false positive and 2 false negatives), yielding a positive predictive value of 77.78 %, a negative predictive value of 88.89 %, and an odds ratio of 28. The relationship between 5-year changes in EDSS and MTr values in T2 weighted MRI lesions was weaker (SRCC -0.43,p = 0.07). Our data support the notion that the quantification of MTr in the NAWM can predict the clinical evolution of MS. Lower MTr values predict poorer long-term clinical outcome. Abnormalities of MTr values in the NAWM are more relevant to the development of future patient disability than those in the T2-weighted MRI lesions.

The influence of these efferents on information processing by vestibular afferents in primates has not been determined. One commonly held notion is that efferent activation during large-amplitude, active head movements would result in an increase in the resting discharge rate and in a reduction of the rotational sensitivity of afferents. Such an effect would increase the dynamic range of afferents involved in the encoding of head movements. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from afferents innervating the semicircular canals in alert macaques during passive head-on-body rotations and during active head movements that included gaze shifts and gaze pursuit. Extracellular, single-unit recordings were obtained from 24 afferent fibers innervating the horizontal, superior, and posterior canals. Based on the normalized coefficient of variation of the interspike interval for these units, our sample contained six regularly discharging, six intermediate, and 12 irregularly discharging afferents. Responses were analyzed using a least squares regression to determine the bias discharge rate of each unit and sensitivity to head velocity and acceleration. We found no difference in bias discharge rate or rotational sensitivity of the afferent responses for the different stimulus conditions tested. Our results indicate that semicircular canal afferents encode information about head rotation similarly for self generated and passively applied head-on- body movements.

Besides producing pain behavior, hind paw formalin injection induces the expression of the immediate-early gene, c-fos. A current controversy is whether noxious stimulus-induced Fos protein immunoreactivity can be considered a proxy (biomarker) of nociception in the spinal cord. We investigated this issue by exploiting our recent demonstration of genotype-dependent behavioral differences in response to formalin injection among inbred mouse strains. Accordingly, 6 inbred and 2 outbred strains were administered formalin (5% in 25 muL) into the ventral hind paw, monitored for licking behavior, and then sacrificed at 90 minutes after injection for Fos protein immunocytochemistry. Significant strain differences were observed in both licking behavior and Fos counts in superficial and deep laminae. We observed a significant correlation among strains between licking behavior in the late phase (10 to 60 minutes) of the formalin test and Fos expression in laminae V-VI (but not laminae I-II) of the dorsal horn (r = 0.94). These findings reinforce the use of the Fos technique to study the neuronal processing underlying pain but suggest that Fos labeling reliably reflects tonic pain behavior only in neurons located in the neck of the dorsal horn in mice.

This is the first study examining the human brain in vivo occupancy by a novel, selective, silent 5-HT1A antagonist. 2-[4-[4-(7-Chloro- 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzdioxyn-5-yl)-1-piperazinyl] butyl]- 1,2-benzisothiazol-3-(2H)-one-1,1-dioxide (DU 125530), a compound in clinical development, has potential applications in the treatment of anxiety and mood disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11][O-methyl-3H]- N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl) ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY-100635), were used to assess 5- HT1A autoreceptor and postsynaptic receptor occupancy in 12 healthy male volunteers. Over a 10- to 40-mg daily dose range, DU 125530 was well tolerated, and exhibited a dose-dependent occupancy from 0 to 72% at 2 h post the last dose. Occupancy correlated significantly with plasma levels of DU 125530, and a fitting of the data to a standard single-site binding model gave a maximum occupancy of similar to80%, and a half-saturation concentration (ED50)of similar to7 ng/ml. At 24 h after the last dose 5-HT1A occupancy was similar to50% of that achieved at 2 h. This study demonstrates that high occupancy of the human brain 5-HT1A receptor can be achieved at doses producing minimal acute side effects.

Decreased expression in the steady state level of EAAT4 mRNA in the OPCA sample was correlated with the selective loss of Purkinje cells. Neuropathological evaluation revealed reactive gliosis and concomitantly increased expression of the mRNA encoding astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Expression of the mRNAs encoding the AMPA receptor subunits GluR2 and GluR3 subunits was found to be decreased in OPCA suggesting that excitotoxic mechanism could play a role in the pathogenesis of the selective neuronal cell death in this disorder.

J	Hamet, P; Tremblay, J				Hamet, P; Tremblay, J			Genetic determinants of the stress response in cardiovascular disease	METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL			English	Article							SPONTANEOUSLY HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; CONVERTING-ENZYME GENE; RECOMBINANT INBRED STRAINS; DETERMINE BLOOD-PRESSURE; HEAT-SHOCK FACTOR; SODIUM-INTAKE; IMMOBILIZATION STRESS; DRUG-METABOLISM; MENTAL STRESS; PULSE-RATE	Originating from Hans Selye's general concept, the biological notion of the stress response implicates neuroendocrine and endocrine pathways as well as their cellular mediators as components of the general adaptation syndrome and its consequences. A highly variable degree of response to psychological and physical stresses has been noted in experimental animals and in human populations. Some stressors, such as the "cold pressor test," have been developed as tools for disease prediction. They apply to variable conditions, from hypertension to insulin resistance, but mostly in relation to cardiovascular outcomes. Other environmental factors, including the degree of salt intake, potentiate the stress response in animals and humans. Our group has undertaken to explore the genetic determinants of the stress response in inbred strains, recombinant congenic and congenic strains, as well as founder human populations. We have succeeded, initially, in linking increased body temperature, a major phenotypic response to stress, to the quantitative trait loci (QTL), one at myh3 on chromosome (Chr) 10, one at hsp27 on Chr 12, and one on Chr Y in the rat. The expression of several stress proteins is under the dominant influence of hstf1 at the rat Chr 7 locus (Mit3). The high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases with traits of enhanced stress responsiveness is discussed here in the context of a paradigm, such as hypertension, in the general population.

While physiological experiments have concluded with the existence of two sets of pores, a large one responsible for the transport of proteins and a small one designed for the diffusion of small solutes, the morphological counterparts have yet to get general agreement. In this review, we present the different proposed paths within and between the endothelial cells that do allow passage of plasma constituents and may respond to the definitions established by physiological means. The vesicular system existing in endothelial cells has been the first transendothelial path to be proposed. Several data have demonstrated the involvement of this system in transport, although others have systematically brought controversy. One alternative to the vesicles has been the demonstration of membrane-bound tubules creating, in certain cases, transendothelial channels that would allow diffusion of plasma proteins and other constituents across the capillary wall. Access to this tubulo-vesicular system could be restrained by the stomatal diaphragm and facilitated by specific membrane receptors. Further, we have demonstrated for the first time with morpho-cytochemical tools, that the intercellular clefts are the site of diffusion for small molecules such as peptides having a molecular weight inferior to 3,000. For the fenestrated capillary bed, we have shown that fenestrae are the site through which plasma constituents cross the capillary wall. However, and in spite of the existence of these large open pores, the endothelial cells still display the tubulo-vesicular system involved in transport of large molecules and their intercellular clefts are also the site of diffusion of small molecules. Making consensus on the existence of an intracellular tubulo-vesicular system in non-fenestrated capillaries, responsible for the transport of large molecules by the endothelial cells, and understanding the rational for the fenestrated capillary to have three paths for transport-the fenestrae, the tubulo-vesicular system, and the inter-endothelial clefts-require further investigation.

J	Bendayan, R; Lee, G; Bendayan, M				Bendayan, R; Lee, G; Bendayan, M			Functional expression and localization of P-glycoprotein at the blood brain barrier	MICROSCOPY RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUE			English	Review						blood-brain barrier; transport; P-glycoprotein; brain endothelial cells; RBE4 cell line	CAPILLARY ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; IN-VITRO MODEL; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; RAT-BRAIN; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; TRANSPORT PROTEINS; PRIMARY CULTURES; EFFLUX PUMP; DRUG-PERMEABILITY	Until recently, the blood-brain barrier was viewed as a static lipid membrane barrier. Physical attributes of the cerebral endothelial cells such as the presence of tight junctions, paucity of vesicles or caveolae, and high electrical resistance were believed to be the primary components that provide the membrane selectivity of the blood-brain barrier to a variety of circulating compounds from the periphery. However, results from molecular biology, immunocytochemistry, biochemistry, and transport studies show that the cerebral endothelial cells possess an asymmetrical array of metabolic enzymes (i.e., alkaline phosphatase, cytochrome P450 enzymes, glutathione transferases) and energy-dependent efflux transport proteins (i.e., P-glycoprotein and Multidrug-resistance proteins) that are instrumental to the barrier function. P-glycoprotein, a membrane-associated, energy-dependent, efflux transporter, is expressed in brain parenchyma (i.e., astrocytes and microglia) as well as in blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers. Its function along the blood-brain barrier is believed to prevent the accumulation of potentially harmful compounds in the brain by actively removing them from the brain into the peripheral circulation. This is a brief review on the expression and activity of P-glycoprotein at the blood-brain barrier, which reports on the localization of the protein in rat brain capillaries in situ as well as in a well-characterized in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier, an immortalized rat brain endothelial cell line, the RBE4. Immunocytochemical analysis employing various P-glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies, demonstrated the presence of the protein along the plasma membrane, in plasmalemmal vesicles and nuclear envelope of rat cerebral endothelial cells, both in situ and in vitro. Western blot analysis revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 170-180 kDa, a size previously reported for P-glycoprotein, in RBE4 cells. In addition, results from functional studies show that the accumulation of the P-glycoprotein substrate digoxin by RBE4 monolayer cells is significantly enhanced in the presence of standard P-glycoprotein inhibitors (verapamil, cyclosporin A, PSC 833), protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir), and the metabolic inhibitor, sodium azide. These results demonstrate the functional expression of P-glycoprotein in the immortalized rat brain endothelial cell line, RBE4. Novel in situ and in vitro intracellular locations of P-glycoprotein in cerebral endothelial cells have been identified suggesting that this transporter may play a significant role in the subcellular distribution of substrates in the brain.

We report that an Ala322Asp mutation in GABRA1, encoding the alpha1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABA(A)), is found in affected individuals of a large French Canadian family with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Compared with wildtype receptors, GABA(A) receptors that contain the mutant subunit show a lesser amplitude of GABA-activated currents in vitro, indicating that seizures may result from loss of function of this inhibitory ligand-gated channel. Our results confirm that mutation of GABRA1 predisposes towards a common idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome in humans.

The objectives of these investigations were to evaluate the changes, if any, on 5-HT synthesis, as measured with alpha-MTrp method, following the inhibition of TPH by PCPA, or the inhibition of proteins synthesis by CXM. The rats were used in the tracer experiment approximately 24 h after the last dose of PCPA was administered, and in the CXM experiments, they were used 30 min following a single injection of CXM. In both experiments, the control rats were injected with the same volume of saline (0.5 ml/kg; s.c.) and at the same times as the drug injections. The results demonstrate that trapping of alpha-MTrp, which is taken to be related to brain 5-HT synthesis, is drastically reduced (40-80%) following PCPA treatment. The inhibition of protein synthesis with CXM did not have a significant effect on the global brain trapping of alpha-MTrp and 5-HT synthesis. These findings suggest that the brain trapping of alpha-[C-14]MTrp relates to brain 5-HT synthesis, but not to brain protein synthesis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

To further characterize mutual adaptations of these two receptor subtypes in the absence of one of them, activation of G-protein coupling by agonist was measured and compared to wildtype (WT) in 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B homozygous knockout (KO) mice. As expected, in WT, the non-selective 5-HT1A/1B receptor agonist 5-carboxyamidotryptamine (5-CT) Stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-[S-35]thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTP(gamma)S) incorporation in many brain regions endowed with one and/or the other receptor, In the respective KOs. no stimulation was measured in regions known to express only or mainly the deleted receptor. In the 5-HT1A KOs, the amplitude of G-protein activation in regions endowed with 5-HT1B receptors was unchanged by comparison to WT. In the 5-HT1B KOs, the magnitude of the 5-CT stimulation was the same as WT in all regions containing 5-HT1A receptors, except in the amygdala. where it was significantly lower, even if this region was one of the most strongly activated in the WT. A similar result was obtained in the amygdala. of 5-HT1B KOs after activation by the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist R-(+)8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Under these conditions, however, there was in addition a significant lowering of the stimulated (but not basal) [S-35]GTP(gamma)S incorporation by comparison to WT in all regions endowed with 5-HT1A receptors, including the dorsal raphe nucleus. Thus, eventhough agonist radioligand binding to either 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptors is unchanged in the reciprocal KOs. it appears that a compensatory decrease in the efficiency of G-protein coupling to 5-HT1A receptors has developed in the 5-HT1B mutant. This could represent the first indication of a crosstalk between these two 5-HT receptor subtypes, at least in brain regions where they are co localized in the same neurons.

These GABAergic interneurons are known to be innervated by synaptic terminals containing enkephalin, an endogenous ligand of mu-opioid receptors. Bath application of mu-opioid receptor agonists inhibits the activity of VTA GABAergic neurons but the mechanism whereby mu-opioid receptors regulate synaptic GABA release from these neurons has not been directly identified. Using cultured VTA neurons we have confirmed that mu-opioid receptor agonists inhibit synaptic GABA release. DAMGO, a selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, had four distinct effects on GABAergic IPSCs: (1) it inhibited the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs), (2) it reduced the amplitude of IPSCs evoked by single action potentials, (3) it inhibited the frequency, but not the amplitude of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs), and (4) DAMGO inhibited mIPSCs evoked by ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore. The inhibition of action potential-evoked IPSCs and of spontaneous and ionomycin-evoked mIPSCs by DAMGO was prevented by the K+ channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). In conclusion, our work shows that one of the mechanisms through which mu-opioid receptors inhibit GABA release by VTA neurons is through inhibition of the secretory process at the nerve terminal level. In addition, considering that ionomycin Stimulates exocytosis through a mechanism that should be insensitive to membrane polarization, our experiments with 4-AP suggest that K+ channels are implicated in the inhibition of the efficacy of the secretory process by mu-opioid receptors.

In the present study, we investigated whether NT also internalizes presynaptically Using synaptosomes from rat neostriatum, a region in which NT1 receptors are virtually all presynaptic. Binding of [H-3]-NT to striatal synaptosomes in the presence of levocabastine to block NT2 receptors is specific, saturable, and has NT1 binding properties. A significant fraction of the bound radioactivity is resistant to hypertonic acid wash indicating that it is internalized. Internalization of [H-3]-NT, like that of [I-125]-transferrin, is blocked by sucrose and low temperature, consistent with endocytosis occurring via a clathrin-dependent pathway. However, contrary to what was reported at the somatodendritic level, neither [H-3]-NT nor [I-125]-transferrin internalization in synaptosomes is sensitive to the endocytosis inhibitor phenylarsine oxide. Moreover, treatment of synaptosomes with monensin, which prevents internalized receptors from recycling to the plasma membrane, reduces [H-3]-NT binding and internalization, suggesting that presynaptic NT1 receptors, in contrast to somatodendritic ones, are recycled back to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that NT internalizes in nerve terminals via an endocytic pathway that is related to, but is mechanistically distinct from that responsible for NT internalization in nerve cell bodies.

J	Boling, W; Olivier, A; Fabinyi, G				Boling, W; Olivier, A; Fabinyi, G			Historical contributions to the modern understanding of function in the central area	NEUROSURGERY			English	Review						central area; cerebral localization; history; motor and sensory function	MOTOR CORTEX; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; AFFERENT INPUTS; RHESUS-MONKEY; BODY-SURFACE; HAND AREA; ORGANIZATION; REPRESENTATION	OBJECTIVE: To review the historical developments leading to the modern understanding of central area physiological features. METHODS: Important scientific writings related to stimulation and function of the central area were studied, beginning with the first electrolytic battery description. RESULTS: Volta's description of the electrolytic battery provided a reliable tool for mapping cortical function. However, 70 years elapsed before Fritsch and Hitzig convincingly demonstrated an excitable cortex and challenged Flourens' theories of cerebral function. The localization of sensory and motor cortical representations was hampered by difficulties in interpreting responses to stimulation in animals and in relating animal data to the human brain. Nevertheless, by the beginning of the 20th century, the evidence for a separate sensory and motor gyrus within the central area was overwhelming. Pioneering surgeons such as Keen, Krause, Foerster, Frazier, and Cushing demonstrated the motor and sensory areas in human subjects during the course of surgery. CONCLUSION: The interpretation of central area function has evolved from the 19th century view that diffuse areas of the cortex and the limbic system serve motor and sensory functions to the theories of Grunbaum, Sherrington, Campbell, and others at the beginning of the 20th century, who suggested segregated functional regions defined by sulcal and architectonic anatomic features. Subsequently, Penfield and Rasmussen supported the idea of a sensorimotor area in which central area function is not strictly separated by the central sulcus. Modern research using microelectrode recordings and functional imaging indicates localized primary sensory and motor functions defined by architectonic anatomic features.

J	Strigo, IA; Bushnell, MC; Boivin, M; Duncan, GH				Strigo, IA; Bushnell, MC; Boivin, M; Duncan, GH			Psychophysical analysis of visceral and cutaneous pain in human subjects	PAIN			English	Article						heat; distention; tonic; phasic; esophagus; skin	SPINOTHALAMIC TRACT NEURONS; THORACIC SPINAL-CORD; AFFERENT-FIBERS; URINARY-BLADDER; CHEST PAIN; VISCEROSOMATIC CONVERGENCE; SPLANCHNIC NERVE; ESOPHAGEAL; CAT; DISTENSION	Clinical evidence suggests that cutaneous and visceral pain differ in sensory, affective, and motivational realms, yet there has been little comparative characterization of these types of pain. This study uses psychophysical measures to compare directly visceral and cutaneous pain and sensitivity. Healthy subjects (10 males, seven females, age 19-29) evaluated perceptions evoked by balloon distention of the distal esophagus and contact heat on the upper chest. Subjects gave continuous ratings of pain intensity using an on-line visual analog scale (VAS), reported maximum pain intensity and unpleasantness on printed VASs, chose phrases from the McGill Pain Questionnaire and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and drew the area of perceived sensation. For esophageal distention, the threshold for pain intensity was higher than that observed for unpleasantness, whereas for contact heat, pain and unpleasantness thresholds did not differ for either phasic (10 s) or tonic (36 s) stimulus application. The relative unpleasantness, calculated as the difference between the unpleasantness and the intensity ratings, was higher during esophageal distention than during either phasic or tonic cutaneous heat; this difference in relative unpleasantness was seen at all intensities of esophageal stimulation. Subjects chose significantly more affective words and reported more anxiety during visceral pain than during phasic cutaneous heat pain. A similar tendency was observed when visceral pain was compared to tonic cutaneous heat pain. Subjects also chose a wider range of words to describe visceral than cutaneous pain. On-line VAS ratings revealed greater pain sensation after stimulus termination during visceral than during phasic cutaneous pain; likewise, a similar tendency was observed between visceral and tonic cutaneous pain. Finally, visceral pain led to a more spatially diffuse sensation and was referred to the entire chest and sometimes to the back. Our results show that visceral pain is more unpleasant, diffuse, and variable than cutaneous pain of similar intensity, independent of the duration of the presented stimuli. The data suggest the likelihood of both similarities and differences in the neural substrates underlying visceral and cutaneous pain. (C) 2002 International Association for the study of Pain.

J	Roux, PP; Barker, PA				Roux, PP; Barker, PA			Neurotrophin signaling through the p75 neurotrophin receptor	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review							NERVE-GROWTH-FACTOR; NF-KAPPA-B; TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; AFFINITY NGF RECEPTOR; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; DEPRIVED SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; ZINC-FINGER PROTEIN; GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3; CULTURED HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS	The neurotrophins are growth factors that play critical roles in the development, maintenance, survival, and death of the nervous system. The signal transducing systems that mediate the diverse biological functions of the neurotrophins are initiated by their interactions with two categories of cell surface receptors, the Trk family of tyrosine kinases and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). While the Trk receptors are responsible for most of the survival and growth properties of the neurotrophins, the actions of p75NTR fall into two categories. First, p75NTR is a Trk co-receptor that can enhance or suppress neurotrophin-mediated Trk receptor activity. Second, p75NTR autonomously activates signaling cascades that result in the induction of apoptosis or in the promotion of survival. The signaling cascades activated by p75NTR remain elusive, but structural and functional differences between p75NTR and other tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily members suggest that p75NTR employs distinct signaling pathways. p75NTR has been shown to activate the NF-kappaB, Akt, and INK pathways and interacts with several adaptor proteins. Of these, NRAGE, NADE, and NRIF have been associated with the induction of apoptosis, and FAP-1, RIP2, and TRAF6 appear to promote cellular survival. It remains a major challenge to link the various p75NTR binding proteins to specific p75NTR-dependent functions, but the identification of p75NTR interactors and signaling pathways has sparked new directions in p75NTR research, and will provide a better understanding of this enigmatic receptor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of MR and US images was performed for 110 normal fetuses and 94 fetuses with central nervous system abnormalities to assess lateral ventricular morphology as having (a) a normal appearance, (b) mild, disproportionate dilatation of the occipital horns with overall preservation of ventricular morphology, (c) colpocephaly with or without normal orientation of the frontal horns, (d) abnormal orientation of the frontal horns without colpocephaly, (e) an angular appearance, (f) fused frontal horns, (g) global dilation, or (h) a distorted appearance. Ventricular morphology on US and MR images was compared and correlated with reference standard diagnoses. RESULTS: US and MR imaging classifications were concordant in 145 of 188 (77%) examinations. Mild disproportion of occipital horns with respect to frontal horns was seen only on MR images. This ventricular configuration was present in eight of 110 normal fetuses and in 10 of 16 fetuses with isolated mild ventriculomegaly (P <.001). An angular configuration of the lateral ventricles, which is seen in fetuses with neural tube defects (NTDs), was present on review of MR images in 11 fetuses and on US images in one fetus. The ventricles of fetuses with NTDs and angular ventricles (3-12 mm) were significantly smaller than those of fetuses with NTDs and global dilatation of the ventricles (13-25 mm; P <.05). CONCLUSION: Ventricular contours differ with differing diagnoses of central nervous system abnormalities. (C) 2002 RSNA.

Eff,ic increased with increasing AD both in supine and upright postures. In upright rabbits Eff,di increased for intermediate but decreased at higher levels of AD, whilst it decreased at all levels of AD in supine rabbits. Tidal volume (VT) response followed that of Eff,di. Tonic Aic and Adi and inspiratory prolongation were elicited by AD. The effects of these neural mechanisms, acting to limit end-expiratory lung volume and VT changes, were however small since vagotomy prevented tonic Adi and inspiratory prolongation and reduced tonic Aic, but changed lung volume responses to AD only little. Hence, reduced respiratory system compliance and changes in inspiratory muscle electromechanical efficiency dominate lung volume responses to acute AD. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This article reviews functional neuroimaging, brain-damaged patients, and behavioral divided visual field studies. It indicates that the notion of a preferential implication of the right frontal cortex in retrieval processes is more readily supported than that of left frontal cortex implication in encoding. Both neuroimaging and divided visual field studies underline the impact of the nature of the material on which memory processes operate. Neuroimaging indicates that for intentional encoding of verbal material prefrontal activations are always left-lateralized, while for intentional encoding of non verbal material activations are sometimes right-lateralized or bilateral. The behavioral divided visual field approach provides consistent results, suggesting that asymmetries in memory performance are determined by hemispheric specialization for verbal/non verbal material and by hemispheric specialization for encoding/retrieval of information in episodic memory. As recently underlined by Cabeza and Nyberg (2000), in order to explain these data one need to integrate the "verbal/pictorial view" and the "Hera view".

Groucho-mediated repression is essential in embryonic development and involved in regulation of Writ signaling in adult tissue. We have determined the 1.6 Angstrom crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of human Groucho/TLE1, comprising part of the Ser/Pro-rich region and a seven-bladed beta propeller WD40 repeat domain, implicated in protein-protein interactions. The structure confirms the relationship to the yeast Tup1 corepressor, but reveals important structural differences specific to the metazoan system. Analysis of missense mutations in the C. elegans Groucho homolog UNC-37 identifies sites of interaction with repression effectors, and suggests an induced fit binding site for eh1 domains of Engrailed-type transcription factors.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes to brain homeostastis and fulfills a protective function by controlling the access of solutes and toxic substances to the central nervous system (CNS). The efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a key element of the molecular machinery that confers special permeability properties to the BBB. 2. P-gp, which was initially recognized for its ability to expel anticancer drugs from multidrug-resistant cancer cells, is strongly expressed in brain capillaries. Its expression in the BBB limits the accumulation of many hydrophobic molecules and potentially toxic substances in the brain. 3. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge about the expression of P-gp, its cellular localization as well as its possible functions in the BBB.

Opt. Soc. Am. A 2 (1985) 284] computes net motion as the difference between directionally opposite energies E-L and E-R. However, Georgeson and Scott-Samuel [Vis. Res. 39 (1999) 43931 found that human direction discrimination is better described by motion contrast (C-m)-a metric where opponent energy (E-L - E-R) is divided by flicker energy (E-L + E-R). In the present paper, we used a lateral masking paradigm to investigate the spatial properties of flicker energy involved in the normalization of opponent energy. Observers discriminated between left and right motion while viewing a checkerboard in which half of the checks contained a drifting sinusoid and the other half contained flicker (i.e. a counterphasing sinusoid). The relative luminance contrasts of flicker and motion checks determined the checkerboard's overall motion contrast C-m. We obtained selectivity functions for opponent-motion normalization by measuring C-m thresholds whilst varying the orientation, spatial frequency, or size of flicker checks. In all conditions, performance (percent correct) decayed lawfully as we decreased motion contrast, validating the C-m metric for our stimuli. Thresholds decreased with check size and also improved as we increased either the orientation or spatial-frequency difference between motion and flicker checks. Our data are inconsistent with Heeger-type normalization models [Vis. Neurosci. 9 (1992) 181] in which excitatory inputs are normalized by a non-selective pooling of inhibitory inputs, but data are consistent with the implicit assumption in Georgeson and Scott-Samuel's model that flicker normalization is localized in orientation, scale, and space. However, our lateral masking paradigm leaves open the possibility that the spatial properties of flicker normalization would be different if opponent and flicker energies spatially overlapped. Further characterization of motion contrast will require models of the spatial, temporal, and joint space-time properties of mechanisms mediating opponent-motion and flicker normalization.

Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to the progression of CHF, and antioxidants have been shown to have beneficial effects when started early after myocardial infarction (MI). In this study, we tested whether the powerful antioxidant probucol would attenuate progression of CHF once it was established after MI in the rat. Methods and Results-Ligation of a coronary artery was used to create an MI in rats (n = 266). Survivors were then randomized 20 days after MI to either probucol 61 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1) or vehicle and followed up for a total of 100 days after MI. Studies of cardiac hemodynamics, LV remodeling, cardiac apoptosis and morphology, systemic neurohumoral activation, oxidative stress, and renal function were then evaluated. Probucol improved LV function (LV maximum rate of pressure rise from 3103 to 4250 mm Hg/s, P<0.05, and LV end-diastolic pressure decrease from 28 to 24 mm Hg, P<0.05), reduced pulmonary weights, prevented right ventricular systolic hypertension, and preserved renal function compared with vehicle. Probucol also prevented LV dilatation, prevented wall thinning (1.70 versus 1.42 mm, P<0.05), reduced cardiac fibrosis and cardiac apoptosis, attenuated increased myocardial cell cross-sectional area, and increased scar thickness. Conclusions-In chronic CHF, probucol exerts multiple beneficial morphological effects that result in better LV remodeling and function, reduced neurohumoral activation, and preserved renal function.

J	Petroulakis, E; Wang, E				Petroulakis, E; Wang, E			Nerve growth factor specifically stimulates translation of eukaryotic elongation factor 1A-1 (eEF1A-1) mRNA by recruitment to polyribosomes in PC12 cells	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SENSITIVE S6 KINASE; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; NEURITE REGENERATION; BINDING-PROTEIN; FACTOR 1-ALPHA; GEL SYSTEM; RAPAMYCIN; EXPRESSION; FACTOR-1-ALPHA; BRAIN	During postnatal brain development the level of peptide elongation factor-1A (eEF1A-1) expression declines and that of the highly homologous isoform, eEF1A-2, increases in neurons. eEF1A-1 is implicated in cytoskeletal interactions, tumorigenesis, differentiation, and the absence of eEF1A-2 is implicated in neurodegeneration in the mouse mutant, wasted. The translation of eEF1A-1 mRNA is up-regulated via mitogenic stimulation. However, it is not known if eEF1A-1 mRNA translation is regulated by neurotrophins or if its synthesis is differentially regulated than that of the neuronal isoform, eEF1A-2. Regulated translation of these factors by neurotrophin, particularly by the Trk class of neurotrophin receptors, would implicate them in differentiation, survival, and neuronal plasticity. In this study, we investigated the effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation on the synthesis of eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2. We found that NGF stimulation causes a preferential synthesis of eEF1A-1 over eEF1A-2 in PC12 cells. We analyzed the co-sedimentation of eEF1A-1 mRNA with polyribosome fractions in sucrose gradients, and found that NGF stimulation enriched the presence of eEF1A-1 mRNA in polyribosomes, indicating that the translation of eEF1A-1 mRNA is regulated by NGF. Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY 294002), mammalian target of rapamycin (rapamycin), and the NGF receptor, TrkA (K-252a), but not of mitogen-activated protein kinase (PD 98059), prevented the recruitment of eEF1A-1 mRNA to polyribosomes. The mobilization of eEF1A-1 mRNA to polyribosomes was rapamycin-sensitive in both proliferating and differentiated PC12 cells, indicating the importance of this pathway during differentiation. Our data shows that after growth factor withdrawal, an NGF-signaling pathway Stimulates eEF1A-1 mRNA translation in proliferating and differentiated PC12 cells. Therefore, eEF1A-1 mRNA is a specific translational target of TrkA signaling.

To identify proteins implicated in these processes, we have isolated the mouse Wave1/Scar gene, a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family. The mouse Wave1 gene was physically localized on chromosome 10 and spans over 12 Kb comprising eight exons and seven introns. The mouse Wave1 complementary DNA encodes a predicted 559 amino acid protein, with a SCAR homology domain, a basic domain, a proline-rich region, a WASP homology domain and an acidic domain conserved in the orthologous proteins. The Wave1 transcription initiation site was mapped 210 base pairs upstream of the ATG translational start site. The presumptive proximal promoter contains putative consensus binding sites for E2 basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3beta, S8 homeodomain protein, zinc finger transcription factor MZF-1, and an interferon-stimulated response element. Northern analysis demonstrated a strong expression of a unique similar to2.6 Kb Wave1 transcript in brain tissue, and in situ hybridization showed restricted expression to Purkinje cells from the cerebellum and pyramidal cells from the hippocampus. Characterization and expression analyses of the murine Wave1 gene provide the basis toward functional studies in mouse models of the role of Wave1 in neuronal cytoskeleton organization.

Preclinical toxicity suggested a predictable toxicity profile consistent with an agent of this class, with evidence of interspecies differences. We conducted a phase I study of troxacitabine given as a 30-minute infusion once every 21 days. Patients and Methods: The starting dose of troxacitabine was 0.025 mg/m(2), based on toxicology data from the most sensitive species studied (cynomolgus monkey). Doses were doubled until grade I skin or mucosal or grade 2 other toxicity was encountered. A modified Fibonacci scale was used. Results: A total of 45 patients were enrolled at 13 dose levels. Most common nonhematologic side effects were skin rash (44%), lethargy (29%), nausea (24%), alopecia, dry skin (18%), anorexia (13%), neurosensory symptoms (13%), and hand-foot syndrome (13%). In patients treated with prednisone 25 mg/d orally for 5 days, starting on day 1, skin rash was less problematic. Two patients at 12.5 mg/ml experienced close-limiting (grade 4) granulocytopenia. Confirmed partial responses were documented in one patient with previously untreated renal cell carcinoma with metastatic lung and bone lesions and in one patient with an unknown primary tumor. Eighteen patients had a best response of stable disease with a median duration of 5.1 months (range, 2.1 to 18.7 months). Conclusion: When given in this schedule, the maximum-tolerated dose of troxacitabine is 12.5 mg/m(2), and the recommended dose for additional phase 11 studies is 10 mg/m(2) once every 21 days with steroid premedication.

We tested this hypothesis in a model of CNS injury: retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death after transection of the adult rat optic nerve. TrkB mRNA rapidly decreased in axotomized RGCs to similar to50% of the level in intact retinas. TrkB gene transfer into RGCs combined with exogenous BDNF administration markedly increased neuronal survival: 76% of RGCs remained alive at 2 weeks after axotomy, a time when >90% of these neurons are lost without treatment. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, but not phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, was required for TrkB-induced survival. These data provide proof-of-principle that enhancing the capacity of injured neurons to respond to trophic factors can be an effective neuroprotective strategy in the adult CNS.

Here we show in rats that sensory-evoked responses were suppressed in the neocortex by activating the brainstem reticular formation and during natural arousal. Sensory suppression occurred at the thalamocortical connection and was a consequence of the activity-dependent depression of thalamocortical synapses caused by increased thalamocortical tonic firing during arousal. Thalamocortical suppression may serve as a mechanism to focus sensory inputs to their appropriate representations in neocortex, which is helpful for the spatial processing of sensory information.

BACKGROUND The cardioprotective effects of ACEIs after MI are thought to be partially due to an increase in bradykinin (BK). Vasopeptidase inhibitors inhibit both ACE and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), further reduce BK metabolism and increase natriuretic peptides, which may result in better cardioprotective effects than with ACEIs after All. METHODS Myocardial infarction was induced in 514 Wistar male rats by ligation of the anterior coronary artery. Rats surviving 4 h after MI (n = 282) were assigned to omapatrilat (40 or 80 mg/kg/day), captopril (160 mg/kg/day) or no treatment. After 56 days, neurohumoral, hemodynamic, ventricular remodeling, morphometry, immunohistochemistry and cardiac cytokine expression were measured. RESULTS Omapatrilat and captopril resulted in similarly improved survival, cardiac hemodynamics and reduced cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy after MI. The pattern of left ventricular (LV) remodeling differed, omapatrilat causing less attenuation of the rightward shift of the LV pressure-volume relation at lower filling pressures than captopril. Both interventions reduced messenger ribonucleic acid expression of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta(1); neither effected the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, and only captopril reduced the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Expression of TNF-alpha was in cardiomyocytes. Both medications reduced circulating endothelin-1, angiotensin II and catecholamines, but only omapatrilat increased atrial natriuretic peptides. CONCLUSIONS This study indicates that both omapatrilat and captopril markedly improve post-MI survival, cardiac function and cardiac remodeling in the rat. It would appear that the addition of NEP inhibition to those of ACEIs does not result in significant further benefit after MI.

The new approach is expected to produce a BP-ANN predictor at least as good as the LR-based one. We have applied the approach to ten data sets of biomedical interest and systematically compared BP-ANN and LR. In all data sets, taking deviance as criterion, the BP-ANN predictor outperforms the LR predictor used in the initialization, and in six cases the improvement is statistically significant. The other evaluation criteria used (C-index, MSE and error rate) yield variable results, but, on the whole, confirm that, in practical situations of clinical interest, proper training may significantly improve the predictive performance of a BP-ANN.

It can bind three to five Ca2+ ions and may act as a Ca2+ buffer to maintain intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, but its exact role is still unknown. In the present study, mass spectrometric analysis reveals that the five cysteine residues in recombinant human brain calbindin D-28K (rHCaBP) are derivatized with N-ethylmaleimide, consistent with the determination of 5.3 +/- 0.4 and 4.7 +/- 0.4 free thiols in the protein using the thiol-specific reagents 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 5-(octyldithio)-2-nitrobenzoic acid, respectively. The results of UV-vis and circular dichroism absorption, intrinsic fluorescence, and mass spectrometry measurements indicate that both Ca2+-loaded (holo) and Ca2+-free (apo) rHCaBP are S-nitrosated by S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO). The number of cysteine residues S-nitrosated in holorHCaBP and aporHCaBP are 2.6 +/- 0.05 and 3.4 +/- 0.09, respectively, as determined by the Saville assay. HolorHCaBP also undergoes S-nitrosation at one to three cysteine residues when exposed to S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), and Cys100 was found to be an S-nitrosation site by peptide mass snapping. Treatment of holorHCaBP with free NO resulted in a mass increase of 59 +/- 2 Da, corresponding to two NO adducts. Since up to four cysteine residues can be S-nitrosated in rHCaBP, it is proposed that the protein may act as a NO buffer or reservoir in the brain in a manner similar to serum albumin in blood. It is significant in this context that rHCaBP is found coexistent with nitric oxide synthase in cerebellum and that S-nitrosation varies with Ca2+ binding, with S-nitrosation occurring to a greater extent in aporHCaBP than in the holoprotein. Furthermore, exposure of rHCaBP to either CysNO or GSNO also leads to rapid S-thiolation of Cys187. We demonstrate here for the first time that intrinsic protein fluorescence is a sensitive probe of protein S-nitrosation. This is due to efficient Forster energy transfer (R-o similar to 17 Angstrom) between tryptophan donors and S-nitrosothiol acceptors.

To fill this gap, we performed a light and electron microscopic analysis of the innervation of skin vessels by sensory and autonomic fibers by using the rat and monkey lower lips as a model. In rats, double-labeling immunocytochemistry revealed that combinations of fibers immunoreactive for substance P (SP) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH), SP and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), as well as DbetaH and VAChT occurred only around blood vessels in the lower dermis. All fiber types travelled in parallel and in close proximity to one another. In the upper dermis, blood vessels were innervated by SP-containing fibers only. Although nerve terminals displayed synaptic vesicles, synaptic specializations were never observed, suggesting that, in this territory, these fibers do not establish synaptic contacts. Quantification of the distance between the various immunoreactive terminals and their presumptive targets (smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells) revealed that both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers were significantly closer to the endothelial cell layer and smooth muscle cells compared with sensory fibers. In monkeys, double-labeling immunocytochemistry was performed for SP-DbetaH and SP-VAChT only. The results obtained are similar to those found in rats; however, the fiber density was greater in monkeys. Our findings suggest that the regulation of skin microcirculation might be the result of the coordinated functions of sensory and autonomic fibers. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Eurich, CW; Mackey, MC; Schwegler, H				Eurich, CW; Mackey, MC; Schwegler, H			Recurrent inhibitory dynamics: The role of state-dependent distributions of conduction delay times	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							INTRINSIC CONDUCTANCES; HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS; PYRAMIDAL NEURON; COMPLEX DYNAMICS; GAMMA RHYTHMS; GAP-JUNCTIONS; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; RECEPTORS; SYNAPSES	We have formulated and analysed a dynamic model for recurrent inhibition that takes into account the state dependence of the delayed feedback signal (due to the variation in threshold of fibres with their size) and the distribution of these delays (due to the distribution of fibre diameters in the feedback pathway). Using a combination of analytic and numerical tools, we have analysed the behaviour of this model. Depending on the parameter values chosen, as well as the initial preparation of the system, there may be a spectrum of post-synaptic firing dynamics ranging from stable constant values through periodic bursting (limit cycle) behaviour and chaotic firing as well as bistable behaviours. Using detailed parameter estimation for a physiologically motivated example (the CA3-basket cell-mossy fibre system in the hippocampus), we present some of these numerical behaviours. The numerical results corroborate the results of the analytic characterization of the solutions. Namely, for some parameter values the model has a single stable steady state while for the others there is a bistability in which the eventual behaviour depends on the magnitude of stimulation (the initial function).

The presentation of Julesz-type random-dot stereograms (RDS) produced significant rCBF elevations in Brodmann areas (BA) 18,19 and 7, all in the right hemisphere. Activation foci were also found in both middle temporal areas (MT). These results demonstrate that, as in primates, cortical area MT and extrastriate areas are central to stereovision and that a network of predominant right hemispheric regions is recruited to meet visuo-spatial processing demands associated with horizontal binocular disparity inputs.

This randomised, phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of capecitabine or paclitaxel in patients with anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer. Outpatients with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer whose disease was unresponsive or resistant to anthracycline therapy were randomised to 3-week cycles of intermittent oral capecitabine (1255 mg m(-2) twice daily, days 1 - 14, (22 patients)) or a reference arm of i.v. paclitaxel (175 mg m-2, (20 patients)). Two additional patients were initially randomised to continuous capecitabine 666 mg m(-2) twice daily, but this arm was closed following selection of the intermittent schedule for further development. Overall response rate was 36% (95% Cl 17 - 59%) with capecitabine (including three complete responses) and 26% (95% Cl 9 - 51%) with paclitaxel (no complete responses). Median time to disease progression was similar in the two treatment groups (3.0 months with capecitabine, 3.1 months with paclitaxel), as was overall survival (7.6 and 9.4 months, respectively). Paclitaxel was associated with more alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, myalgia and neutropenia, whereas typical capecitabine-related adverse events were diarrhoea, vomiting and hand -foot syndrome. Twenty-three per cent of capecitabine-treated patients and 16% of paclitaxel-treated patients achieved a greater than or equal to 10% improvement in Karnofsky Performance Status. Oral capecitabine is active in anthracycline-pretreated advanced/metastatic breast cancer and has a favourable safety profile. Furthermore, capecitabine provides a convenient, patient-orientated therapy. (C) 2002 Cancer Research UK.
