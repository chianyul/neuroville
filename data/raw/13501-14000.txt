Design: Test-retest 10 to 14 days apart. Setting: Laboratory of a University-affiliated center for research in rehabilitation. Participants: Twenty persons post cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and 46 healthy persons (controls). Intervention: The reproducibility of the TDMI screening test, wherein the number of stepping movements (performed in sitting) imagined over 15, 25, and 45 seconds is recorded, and of the temporal congruence test wherein the duration of physically executed (E) and imagined (1) stepping movements is recorded, was evaluated. Main Outcome Measures: The test-retest reliability of the number of imagined movements (TDMI screening test), movement duration and I/E time ratios (temporal congruence test), and intrasession reliability of the temporal congruence test were assessed by using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: For the TDMI screening test, the ICCs ranged from .88 to .93 (CVA, n=20) and from .87 to .92 (controls, n=9). For the temporal congruence test, when the total duration of 2 series of 5 stepping movements was averaged, ICCs ranged from .76 to .97 (CVA, n=20) and from .77 to .93, (controls, n=46), whereas for 1 series the ICCs ranged from .71 to .95 and from .63 to .95 in the CVA and control groups, respectively. The ICCs for intrasession reliability for the CVA (n=20) and control (n=46) groups, respectively, ranged from .90 to .98 and .95 to .97. Conclusions: The present findings support the reproducibility of both tests in both groups. Mental chronometry can be used reliably for the screening of patients capable of motor imagery or for measuring temporal congruence between real and imagined movements poststroke.

J	Racine, E				Racine, Eric			Which naturalism for bioethics? A defense of moderate (pragmatic) naturalism	BIOETHICS			English	Article						naturalism; pragmatism; bioethics; neuroethics; epistemology	CLINICAL PRAGMATISM	There is a growing interest in various forms of naturalism in bioethics, but there is a clear need for further clarification. In an effort to address this situation, I present three epistemological stances: anti-naturalism, strong naturalism, and moderate pragmatic naturalism. I argue that the dominant paradigm within philosophical ethics has been a form of anti-naturalism mainly supported by a strong 'is' and 'ought' distinction. This fundamental epistemological commitment has contributed to the estrangement of academic philosophical ethics from major social problems and explains partially why, in the early 1980s, 'medicine saved the life of ethics'. Rejection of anti-naturalism, however, is often associated with strong forms of naturalism that commit the naturalistic fallacy and threaten to reduce the normative dimensions of ethics to biological imperatives. This move is rightly dismissed as a pitfall since ethics is, in part, a struggle against the course of nature. Rejection of naturalism has drawbacks, however, such as detering bioethicists from acknowledging the implicit naturalistic epistemological commitments of bioethics. I argue that a moderate pragmatic form of naturalism represents an epistemological position that best embraces the tension of anti-naturalism and strong naturalism: bioethics is neither disconnected from empirical knowledge nor subjugated to it. The discussion is based upon historical writings in philosophy and bioethics.

Parametric spectral analysis of nonstationary fluctuations of excitatory synaptic currents	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article							MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR DESENSITIZATION; POSTSYNAPTIC CURRENTS; HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPSE; CHANNEL PROPERTIES; TIME-SERIES; TRANSMISSION; CLEFT; EEG; MODELS	We assessed on Monte-Carlo simulated excitatory post-synaptic currents the ability of autoregressive (AR)-model fitting to evaluate their fluctuations. AR-model fitting consists of a linear filter describing the process that generates the fluctuations when driven with a white noise. Its fluctuations provide a filtered version of the signal and have a spectral density depending on the properties of the linear filter. When the spectra of the non-stationary fluctuations of excitatory post-synaptic currents were estimated by fitting AR-models to the segments of current fluctuations, assumed to be stationary and independent, the parameter and spectral estimates were scattered. The scatter was much reduced if the time-variant AR-models were fitted using stochastic adaptive estimators (Kalman, recursive least squares and least mean squares). The ability of time-variant AR-models to accurately fit the current fluctuations was monitored by comparing the fluctuations with predicted fluctuations, and by evaluating the model-learning rate. The median frequency of current fluctuations, which could be rapidly tracked and estimated from the individual quantal events (either Monte-Carlo simulated or recorded from pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus), rose during the rise phase, before declining to a lower steady-state level during the decay phase of quantal event, whereas the variance showed a broad peak. The closing rate of AMPA channels directly affects the steady-state median frequency, whereas the transient peak can be modulated by a variety of factors-number of molecules released, ability of glutamate molecules to re-enter the synaptic cleft, diffusion constant of glutamate in the cleft and opening rate of AMPA channels. In each case, the effect on the amplitude and decay time of mEPSCs and on the current fluctuations differs. Each factor thus leaves its own kinetic fingerprint arguing that the contribution of such factors can be inferred from the combined kinetic properties of individual mEPSCs.	[Glavinovic, M.

J	Bauer, M; Beaulieu, S; Dunner, DL; Lafer, B; Kupka, R				Bauer, Michael; Beaulieu, Serge; Dunner, David L.; Lafer, Beny; Kupka, Ralph			Rapid cycling bipolar disorder - diagnostic concepts	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Review						antidepressants; bipolar disorder; DSM-IV; hypomania; lithium; mood shifts; rapid cycling	MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ILLNESS; ANTIDEPRESSANT-INDUCED MANIA; EARLY ADOLESCENT BIPOLARITY; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR BDNF; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; THYROID-FUNCTION; DSM-IV; CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS; ANTI-DEPRESSANTS	Objectives: This paper reviews the literature to examine the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for rapid cycling in bipolar disorder. Methods: Studies on the clinical characteristics of rapid cycling bipolar disorder were reviewed. To identify relevant papers, literature searches using PubMed and MEDLINE were undertaken. Results: First observed in the prepharmacologic era, rapid cycling subsequently has been associated with a relatively poor response to pharmacologic treatment. Rapid cycling can be conceptualized as either a high frequency of episodes of any polarity or as a temporal sequence of episodes of opposite polarity. The DSM-IV defines rapid cycling as a course specifier, signifying at least four episodes of major depression, mania, mixed mania, or hypomania in the past year, occurring in any combination or order. It is estimated that rapid cycling is present in about 12-24% of patients at specialized mood disorder clinics. However, apart from episode frequency, studies over the past 30 years have been unable to determine clinical characteristics that de. ne patients with rapid cycling as a specific subgroup. Furthermore, rapid cycling is a transient phenomenon in many patients. Conclusions: While a dimensional approach to episode frequency as a continuum between the extremes of no cycling and continuous cycling may be more appropriate and provide a framework to include ultra-rapid and ultradian cycling, the evidence does not exist today to re. ne the DSM-IV definition in a less arbitrary manner. Continued use of the DSM-IV definition also enables comparisons between past and future studies, and it should be included in the next release of the ICD. Further scientific investigation into rapid cycling is needed. In addition to improving the diagnostic criteria, insight into neurophysiologic mechanisms of mood switching and episode frequency may have important implications for clinical care.

Methods Surgery was performed with a conventional median sternotomy. Analgesia was provided with TEA at T1-2 or 2-3 interspace, using bupivacaine 0.5% and sufentanil 1.66 mu g ml(-1), initially at 20 ml litre(-1) until T1-10 dermatomal block was achieved, then maintained at 2-14 ml litre(-1) throughout surgery. Femoral nerve block was performed before operation with neuro-stimulation at the saphenous vein harvest site with 10 ml each of bupivacaine 0.25% and lidocaine 2%. Successful awake surgery, avoiding general anaesthesia (GA) with adequate surgical conditions, without CPB was the primary end point. Results Fifteen men, mean (SD) age of 63 (9) yr (range 49-81 yr), weight 78 (10) kg, underwent surgery. Three patients (20%) needed conversion to GA: one patient due to insufficient thoracic analgesia, another required initiation of CPB, and the third needed stabilization of the heart for graft suturing due to profound respiratory movements. All three were successfully extubated immediately after surgery. Awake surgery was successful and uneventful in 80% of cases. Conculsions Combined TEA and femoral block is a novel anaesthetic technique, and is feasible, for cardiac surgery. However, certain technical limitations need to be overcome to evaluate the full potential of 'awake' cardiac surgery.

The effect of protective headgear on head injuries and concussions in adolescent football (soccer) players	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL; ICE HOCKEY; PREVALENCE; MECHANISMS; COLLEGIATE; STATES; SPORT; RISK	Objective: To examine the effects of protective headgear in adolescent football (soccer) players. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Oakville Soccer Club, Oakville, Canada. Participants: Football players aged 12-17 years. Intervention: A questionnaire examining the 2006 football season using self-reported symptoms. Main outcome measures: The number of concussions experienced during the current football season, the duration of symptoms, injuries to the head and face and any associated risk factors for these injuries. Results: In the population studied, 47.8% had experienced symptoms of a concussion during the current football year. 26.9% of athletes who wore headgear (HG) and 52.8% of those who did not wear headgear (No-HG) had concussions. Approximately 4 out of 5 athletes in each group did not realize they had suffered a concussion. More than one concussion was experienced by 50.0% of the concussed HG athletes and 69.3% of the concussed No-HG group. 23.9% of all concussed players experienced symptoms for at least 1 day or longer. Variables that increased the risk of suffering a concussion during the 2006 football year included being female and not wearing headgear. Being female and not wearing football headgear increased the risk of suffering an abrasion, laceration or contusion on areas of the head covered by football headgear. Conclusion: Adolescent football players experience a significant number of concussions. Being female may increase the risk of suffering a concussion and injuries on the head and face, while the use of football headgear may decrease the risk of sustaining these injuries.	[Delaney, J.

This study evaluates the clinical relevance of the short-segment pedicle fixation supplemented by laminar hooks (2HS-1SH) construct in the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. Twenty-five patients with a single-level thoracolumbar burst fracture were assessed in this retrospective study. All patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year (mean 2.9 [standard deviation {SD}] 1.5 y). Preoperative vertebral height loss and local kyphosis were 35% (SD 14%) and 19 (SD 9), respectively. Mean corrections of vertebral height and kyphosis were 10% (SD 16%) and 12 (SD 9), respectively. Mean loss of correction at last follow-up was 2% (SD 6%) and 4 (SD 3) for vertebral height and kyphosis, respectively. Loss of correction was significant for local kyphosis (p < 0.001) but not for vertebral height (p = 0.20). Despite the significant loss of correction for local kyphosis, it remained improved at latest follow-up when compared with the preoperative value (p < 0.001). For patients with more than 2 years of follow-up, most of the loss of correction in local kyphosis occurred during the first postoperative year. There was no evidence of instrumentation failure or pseudarthrosis in any patient. The 2HS-1SH construct provides significant correction of vertebral body height and local kyphosis. It also preserves the initial correction and minimizes the risk of instrumentation failure.

However, the molecular underpinnings linking centrosome position to axon emergence are unknown. GAP-43 is a calmodulin-binding IQ motif protein that regulates neuronal cytoskeletal architecture by interacting with F-actin in a phosphorylation dependent manner. Here we show that GAP-43 is associated with the centrosome and plays a critical role in mitosis and acquisition of neuronal polarity in cerebellar granule neurons. In the absence of GAP-43, the centrosome position is delinked from process outgrowth and is only capable of mediating morphological polarization, however molecular specification of the axonal compartment does not take place. These results show that GAP-43 is required to link centrosome position to process outgrowth in order to generate neuronal polarity in cerebellar granule cells.

Selective deficit of mental visual imagery with intact primary visual cortex and visual perception	CORTEX			English	Article						visual imagery and perception; V1; higher order visual cortices; non-visual and motor imagery; brain damaged patients	CORTICAL BLINDNESS; BRAIN; DISSOCIATION; EXTINCTION; AREAS; FMRI	There is a vigorous debate as to whether visual perception and imagery share the same neuronal networks, whether the primary visual cortex is necessarily involved in visual imagery, and whether visual imagery functions are lateralized in the brain. Two patients with brain damage from closed head injury were submitted to tests of mental imagery in the visual, tactile, auditory, gustatory, olfactory and motor domains, as well as to an extensive testing of cognitive functions. A computerized mapping procedure was used to localize the site and to assess the extent of the lesions. One patient showed pure visual mental imagery deficits in the absence of imagery deficits in other sensory domains as well as in the motor domain, while the other patient showed both visual and tactile imagery deficits. Perceptual, language, and memory deficits were conspicuously absent. Computerized analysis of the lesions showed a massive involvement of the left temporal lobe in both patients and a bilateral parietal lesion in one patient. In both patients the calcarine cortex with the primary visual area was bilaterally intact. our study indicates that: (i) visual imagery deficits can occur independently from deficits of visual perception; (ii) visual imagery deficits can occur when the primary visual cortex is intact and (iii) the left temporal lobe plays an important role in visual mental imagery.

Specifically, increased expression of interleukin (IL)-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, has been observed in AD cerebrospinal fluid and temporal brain tissue. Both of these immunomodulators were shown to carry genetic variants that increase the risk of developing AD. Studies have also established the apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene to be a risk factor for AD with epsilon 4 carriers having been found to show lower levels of brain apoE. In the present study, treatment of primary rat mixed glial cell cultures with IL-1 beta induced a significant increase in extracellular apoE protein. In contrast, treatment primary rat astrocyte and mixed glial cell cultures with TNF-alpha significantly reduced extracellular apoE protein levels. These results are consistent with the notion that elevated cytokine expression directly modulates immunosuppression and indirectly apoE-mediated neuronal remodeling.

Methods: A self-administered measure (Beck Cognitive Insight Scale BCIS) and clinician-rated scales (Scale of Unawareness of Mental Disorder - SUMD and Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale - PANSS-G12 insight item) were completed by 38 patients with a diagnosis of FEP. Results: The scales had good internal consistency and only the clinician-rated scales were intercorrelated (SUMD - awareness of mental disorder and PANSS-G12 items (r = 0.657, P < 0.001)). Moreover, we observed a significant association of SUMD and PANSS positive and general subscales and a trend association for BCIS and PANSS negative subscale. Conclusion: Differential associations observed between insight and symptoms may suggest different clinical predictive values for each measure. Our results suggest the necessity to qualify the term 'insight' when discussing research results, most notably with respect to who is rating and what aspect of insight is being rated.

However, this procedure has many limitations, especially in children. As an alternative to IAT, in the case described here, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to investigate expressive and receptive language lateralization as part of the presurgical evaluation of a 9-year-old Yiddish-speaking boy with a probable left temporal epileptic focus. This child could not tolerate IAT or functional MRI. He underwent two NIRS recording sessions while performing expressive and receptive language tasks. Results indicated predominantly left-sided expressive language in Broca's area with ipsilateral cortical recruitment of more posterior regions. Receptive language showed a bilateral cerebral pattern, perhaps as an expression of cerebral plasticity or compensation in this young patient. This case report illustrates that NIRS may contribute to presurgical investigation and could become a noninvasive alternative to IAT and functional MRI in determining speech lateralization in children.

BF fibres were labelled by anterograde transport using biotin dextran amine (BDA) and dual-stained for the vesicular transporter proteins (VTPs) for glutamate (VGluT), GABA (VGAT) or acetylcholine (VAChT). Viewed by fluorescence microscopy and estimated by stereology, proportions of BDA-labelled varicosities were found to be stained for VGluT2 (and not VGluT1 or 3), VGAT or VAChT (representing, respectively, similar to 15%, similar to 52% and similar to 19% within the infralimbic cortex). Each type was present in all, though commonly most densely in deep, cortical layers. Material was triple-stained for postsynaptic proteins to examine whether BDA+VTP+ varicosities might form excitatory or inhibitory synapses, respectively, labelled by postsynaptic density-95 kDA (PSD-95) or gephyrin (Geph). Viewed by confocal microscopy, a majority of BDA+/VGluT2+ varicosities were found to be apposed to PSD-95+ elements, and a majority of BDA+/VGAT+ varicosities to be apposed to Geph+ elements. Other series were triple-stained for cell marker proteins to assess whether the varicosities contacted interneurons or pyramidal cells. Viewed by confocal microscopy, BDA-labelled VGluT2+, VGAT+ and VAChT+ BF terminals were all found in contact with calbindin+ interneurons, whereas VGAT+ BF terminals were also seen in contact with parvalbumin+ interneurons and non-phosphorylated neurofilament+ pyramidal cells. Through distinct glutamatergic, GABAergic and cholinergic projections, the BF can thus influence cortical activity in a diverse manner.

Detection of unexpected events during spatial navigation in humans: bottom-up attentional system and neural mechanisms	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; functional magnetic resonance imaging; humans; navigation; virtual reality	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL-ATTENTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; SINGLE NEURONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; COGNITIVE ACTIVATION; DIRECTED ATTENTION; CORTICAL NETWORK	Navigation is a complex cognitive ability requiring the processing and integration of several different types of information extracted from the environment. While navigating, however, an unexpected event may suddenly occur, which individuals are required to detect promptly in order to apply an appropriate behavioural response. The alerting mechanism that is integral to the detection of unexpected events is referred to as the bottom-up attentional system. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural basis of bottom-up detection of unexpected events while individuals moved within a virtual environment. We identified activation within a right fronto-temporo-parietal network in response to unexpected events while navigating in this virtual environment. Furthermore, when an unexpected event requires an adjusted behavioural response, a region of the right ventrolateral pre-frontal cortex (areas 45 and 47/12) is selectively activated. Our data replicate earlier findings on the neural mechanisms underlying visual attention and extend these findings to the more complex real-life ability of spatial navigation, thereby suggesting that these neural mechanisms subserve the bottom-up attentional systems that are crucial for effective locomotion in real surroundings.

Its precise role, however, remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that when stimuli in memory are related to each other in multiple ways, and therefore familiarity, strong constant stimulus-stimulus links or contextual cues are not sufficient for successful retrieval, control processing emanating from the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is required to disambiguate and select the appropriate information among memory traces. We refer to this type of retrieval as active retrieval to distinguish it from automatic retrieval which depends on the simple reactivation of memory traces. Normal human subjects were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed three memory tasks that varied in their demands on active retrieval of verbal information. As the demands on active retrieval increased, there was an increase in the activity within the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, but with more prominent activity in the left hemisphere. These activity increases correlated with activity in the posterior temporal region which, in the left hemisphere, is involved in language processing. No significant activity increases were observed in any other prefrontal region. Furthermore, for the retrieval of well-learned verbally cued conditional motor associations, there were no activity increases in the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The present findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, particularly in the left hemisphere, plays a major role in the active retrieval of information from verbal memory.

However, a number of factors hamper real progress in this direction. Therefore, there is a need for forecasting demand by the participants in the absence of full information about other participants' demand. In this paper we investigate the applicability of advanced machine learning techniques, including neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and support vector machines, to forecasting distorted demand at the end of a supply chain (bullwhip effect). We compare these methods with other, more traditional ones, including naive forecasting, trend, moving average, and linear regression. We use two data sets for our experiments: one obtained from the simulated supply chain, and another one from actual Canadian Foundries orders. Our findings suggest that while recurrent neural networks and support vector machines show the best performance, their forecasting accuracy was not statistically significantly better than that of the regression model.

Sensorimotor adaptation in Parkinson's disease: evidence for a dopamine dependent remapping disturbance	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						striatum; levodopa; dopamine; movement; perception; procedural learning; neuropsychology	MOTOR SKILL; VISUAL FEEDBACK; BASAL GANGLIA; VISUOMOTOR SEQUENCE; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; DIRECTED MOVEMENTS; FRONTAL LOBES; STRIATUM; PERFORMANCE; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Sensorimotor adaptation is thought to involve a remapping of the kinematic and kinetic parameters associated with movements performed within a changing environment. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are known to be affected on this type of learning process, although the specific role of dopamine depletion in these deficits has not yet been elucidated. The present study was an attempt to clarify whether dopamine depletion in PD may directly affect the capacity to internally reorganize the visuomotor remapping of a distorted environment. Fourteen PD patients were tested twice, while they were treated and while they were withdrawn from their regular levodopa treatment. Fourteen control subjects were also enrolled and tested twice. Two parallel forms of the Computed Mirror Pointing Task (CMPT), requiring making a reaching movement in a visually transformed environment (mirror inversion), were administered to each participant. Each of them had to perform 40 trials at each of the 2 testing sessions. At each trial, sensorimotor adaptation was evaluated by the initial direction angle (IDA), which reflects the direction of movement before any visually guided readjustment. Results revealed no IDA difference at baseline, between control subject and PD patients, whether they were treated or not. In all group, IDA values at that time were large, reflecting a tendency to make movements according to the real life visuomotor mapping (based on the natural direct vision). However, striking differences appeared during sensorimotor learning, in that IDA reduction along trials was poorer in patient not treated with levodopa than both control subjects and the same PD patient treated with levodopa. No difference was observed between the treated PD patients and control subjects. Given that IDA is thought to reflect the internal representation of the visuomotor mapping, it is concluded that dopamine depletion in PD would affects sensorimotor adaptation, in that it facilitates old and poorly adapted movements (real life mapping), instead of new and more adapted ones (mirror transformed mapping).

Potential clinical relevance of the 'little brain' on the mammalian heart	EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							INTRINSIC CARDIAC NEURONS; PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; FAT PAD; ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODES; PULMONARY VEIN; CANINE HEART; DOG HEART; VENTRICULAR NEURONS; MICROSCOPIC ANATOMY	It is hypothetized that the heart possesses a nervous system intrinsic to it that represents the final relay station for the co-ordination of regional cardiac indices. This 'little brain' on the heart is comprised of spatially distributed sensory (afferent), interconnecting (local circuit) and motor (adrenergic and cholinergic efferent) neurones that communicate with others in intrathoracic extracardiac ganglia, all under the tonic influence of central neuronal command and circulating catecholamines. Neurones residing from the level of the heart to the insular cortex form temporally dependent reflexes that control overlapping, spatially determined cardiac indices. The emergent properties that most of its components display depend primarily on sensory transduction of the cardiovascular milieu. It is further hypothesized that the stochastic nature of such neuronal interactions represents a stabilizing feature that matches cardiac output to normal corporal blood flow demands. Thus, with regard to cardiac disease states, one must consider not only cardiac myocyte dysfunction but also the fact that components within this neuroaxis may interact abnormally to alter myocyte function. This review emphasizes the stochastic behaviour displayed by most peripheral cardiac neurones, which appears to be a consequence of their predominant cardiac chemosensory inputs, as well as their complex functional interconnectivity. Despite our limited understanding of the whole, current data indicate that the emergent properties displayed by most neurones comprising the cardiac neuroaxis will have to be taken into consideration when contemplating the targeting of its individual components if predictable, long-term therapeutic benefits are to accrue.

This information can be effectively utilized by intelligent agents equipped with adaptive capabilities to learn from past negotiations and assist in selecting appropriate negotiation tactics. This paper presents an approach to modeling the negotiation process in a time-series fashion using artificial neural network. In essence, the network uses information about past offers and the current proposed offer to simulate expected counter-offers. On the basis of the model's prediction, "what-if" analysis of counter-offers can be done with the purpose of optimizing the current offer. The neural network has been trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with Bayesian Regularization. The simulation of the predictive model on a testing set has very good and highly significant performance. The findings suggest that machine learning techniques may find useful applications in the context of electronic negotiations.

In addition, axonal migration on a two-dimensional Petri dish does not reflect the three-dimensional (3D) environment in vivo. A unique in vitro 3D model of motor nerve regeneration was developed to study motor neuron axonal migration and myelination. Mouse spinal cord motor neurons were seeded on a collagen sponge populated with Schwann cells and fibroblasts. This fibroblast-populated sponge was intended to mimic the connective tissue through which motor axons have to elongate in vivo. Addition of conventional neurotrophic supplements was not required for motor neuron survival but was necessary to promote deep neurite outgrowth, as assessed by immunostaining of neurofilament M. A vigorous neurite elongation was detected inside the sponge after only 14 days of neuron culture, reaching more than 850 mu m. The model also allowed the maturation of motor fibers as one-third of them were positive for neurofilament H. Neurites growing in the sponge were subject to myelination when Schwann cells were present, as shown by myelin basic protein immunostaining and electron microscopy. We demonstrated in this model the spontaneous formation of numerous thick myelin sheaths surrounding motor fibers after long-term culture (28 days). Thus, this model might be a valuable tool to study the effect of various cells and/or attractive or repulsive molecules on motor neurite outgrowth in vitro and also for the study of myelination and pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases.

Adult male mice from 14 A/J and 22 B6 background lines were evaluated for emotional reactivity in open-field (OF) and elevated plus-maze tests. Core temperature was monitored by radio telemetry during immobilization and on standard as well as salt-enriched diets. In addition, urinary electrolytes were measured. Genome-wide linkage analysis of the parameters revealed over 20 significant quantitative trait loci (QTL). The highest logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were within the previously-reported OF emotionality locus on Chr 1 (LOD = 4.6), in the dopa decarboxylase region on Chr 11 for the plus-maze (LOD = 4.7), and within a novel region of calmodulin 1 on Chr 12 for Ca(++) excretion after a 24-h salt load (LOD = 4.6). RCS stress QTL overlapped with several candidate loci for cardiovascular (CV) disease. In silico evidence of functional polymorphisms by comparative sequence analysis of progenitor strains assisted to ascertain this convergence. The anxious BcA70 strain showed down regulation of Atp1a2 gene expression in the heart (P < 0.001) and brain (P < 0.05) compared with its parental B6 strain, compatible with the enhanced emotionality described in knock out animals for this gene, also involved in the salt-sensitive component of hypertension. Functional polymorphisms in regulatory elements of candidate genes of the CV/inflammatory/immune systems support the hypothesis of genetically-altered environmental susceptibility in CV disease development.

Neural excitation of muscles was set based on inverse dynamics approach along with the stability-based optimization. The effect of muscle spindle reflex response on the trunk movement stability was evaluated upon the application of a perturbation moment. The method was used to simulate the trunk movement from the upright standing to 60 degrees of flexion. Incorporation of the stability condition as an additional constraint in the optimization resulted in an increase in antagonistic activities demonstrating that the antagonistic co-activation acts to increase the trunk stability in response to self-induced postural internal perturbation. In presence of a 30 Nm flexion perturbation moment, muscle spindles decreased the induced deviation of the position and velocity profiles from the desired ones. The stability-generated co-activation decreased the reflexive response of muscle spindles to the perturbation demonstrating that the rise in muscle co-activation can ameliorate the corruption of afferent neural sensory system at the expense of higher loading of the spine.

Herein, we discuss the experimental evidence that kinins may exert influence on multiple players of the immune system (i.e. macrophages, dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes), and modulate the activation, proliferation, migration and effector functions of these cells. We also give an overview of the possible impact of kinins in human autoimmune diseases and corresponding animal models, with special emphasis on autoimmune neuroinflammation and arthritis. These studies indicate a possible immunomodulatory capacity of kinins beyond our current knowledge of kinin actions regarding the vascular system, and thus the way towards future therapeutic approaches.

This study measured the densities of B1R and B2R binding sites in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) by quantitative autoradiography, and evaluated the effects of two selective non-peptide antagonists at B1R (LF22-0542) and B2R (LF16-0687) on pain behavior after partial ligation of the left sciatic nerve. Increases of B1R binding sites were seen in superficial laminae of the ipsi- and contralateral spinal cord at 2 and 14 days white B2R binding sites were increased on the ipsilateral side at 2 days and on both sides at 14 days. In DRG, B1R and B2R binding sites were significantly increased at 2 days (ipsilateral) and 14 days on both sides. Whereas tactile allodynia started to develop progressively from 2 to 25 days post-ligation, the occurrence of cold allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia became significant from day 8 and day 14 post-ligation, respectively. At day 21 after sciatic nerve ligation, thermal hyperalgesia was blocked by LF22-0542 (10 mg/kg, s.c.) and LF16-0687 (3 mg/kg, s.c.), yet both antagonists had no effect on tactile and cold allodynia. Data highlight the implication of both kinin receptors in thermal hyperalgesia but not in tactile and cold allodynia. associated with peripheral nerve injury. Hence LF22-0542 and LF16-0687 present therapeutic potential for the treatment of some aspects of neuropathic pain. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Petcu, M.; Dias, J.

We describe a novel mutation affecting the OSTM1 locus responsible for ARO. In addition to common clinical features of osteopetrosis, the patient developed a unique neuronal pathology that provided evidence for an essential role of OSTM1 in normal neuronal cell development. Introduction: Infantile autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO) is a genetic disorder characterized by osteoclast dysfunction that leads to osteopetrosis. We describe a novel mutation affecting the OSTM1 locus responsible for ARO. In addition to common clinical features of osteopetrosis, the patient developed a unique neuronal pathology that provided evidence for an essential role of OSTM1 in normal neuronal cell development. Materials and Methods: We report a new case of ARO caused by an homozygous mutation in OSTM1. In addition to osteopetrosis and bone marrow failure, this patient also had neurological impairment not related to bone entrapment. Retinal dystrophy with absent evoked visual potentials and sensorineural deafness were documented, as well as cerebral atrophy and bilateral atrial subependymal heterotopias. Results: The patient developed generalized seizures and had a profound developmental delay. Nerve biopsy failed to show inclusion material suggestive of neuroaxonal dystrophy. Bone marrow transplantation was declined considering the severe neurological compromise. The patient died at 1 yr of age. Osteoclasts derived from peripheral blood were mature and multinucleated. Expression analysis showed that the amount of OSTM1 cDNA transcript was significantly lowered but not absent. Conclusions: These results support the role of OSTM1 in osteoclast function and activation. However, they also suggest that OSTM1 has a primary role in neural development not related to lysosomal dysfunction.

To test if cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons - the local integrators of cortical activity - are involved in this coupling, we stimulated the basalocortical pathway in vivo, monitored cortical CBF, and identified the activated interneurons (c-Fos-immunopositive) and the neuromediators involved in this response. Basal forebrain (BF) stimulation induced ipsilateral increases in CBF and selective activation of layers II to VI somatostatin- and/or neuropeptide Y-containing, as well as layer I GABA interneurons. Nitric oxide synthase interneurons displayed weak bilateral activation, whereas vasoactive intestinal polypeptide- or acetylcholine (ACh)-containing GABA interneurons were not activated. Selective cholinergic deafferentation indicated that ACh released from stimulated BF afferents triggered the CBF response, but the latter was mediated, in part, by the local release of GABA from cholinoceptive cortical interneurons, and through GABA-A receptor-mediated transmission. These data show that activation of specific subsets of GABA interneurons and their GABA-A-mediated effects on neuronal, vascular, and/or astroglial targets are necessary for the full expression of the hemodynamic response to BF stimulation. Further, these findings highlight the importance of understanding the cellular networks and circuitry that underlie hemodynamic signals, as only specific subsets of neurons may be activated by a given stimulus, depending on the afferent inputs they receive and integrate.

The index patient is a boy who presented initially for evaluation at the age of 5 years with a 2-year history of gait problems. Both parents and 3 male siblings were entirely well. Examination revealed a striking diffuse muscular hypertrophy, diffuse mild to moderate weakness, Gower sign, percussion, and grip myotonia. Electromyography confirmed myotonia, and molecular analysis revealed 2 copies of the T310M mutation on the CLCN1 gene. Testing of family members revealed a normal neurological examination without clinical myotonia in all and electromyographic evidence of myotonia and a single copy of the T310M mutation in both parents and 2 siblings.

After the catheter was secured to the skin, the minimal stimulatory threshold was verified again and found to be extremely low (0.00-0.01 mA; pulse width, 0.1 ms). However, in spite of this situation, no paresthesia or pain was experienced by the patient. Use of the catheter resulted in satisfactory analgesia with no complications noted during the hospital stay or at follow-up three months later. When the nerve stimulator was sent to our biomedical engineering department to verify the accuracy of its current output, it was found to be functioning adequately. Neurostimulation is a complex phenomenon that is far from being completely understood. On the basis of this single report, we cannot recommend the routine use of a threshold inferior to 0.2 mA for neural electrolocation. However, we do not advocate the requirement of strict numerical thresholds either. Further research is needed to understand the relationship linking stimulatory threshold and distance between needle (or catheter) tip and nerve. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although antipsychotic switching is a common strategy for managing extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), there is insufficient empirical support to guide the clinician. We designed the present study to examine whether patients with preexisting EPS switched to quetiapine would show greater reduction in EPS compared with control patients. Methods: Twenty-two patients with schizophrenia meeting clinical criteria for tardive dyskinesia or coexisting parkinsonism were randomized either to switch from their current antipsychotic to quetiapine (n = 13) or to remain on their current treatment (n = 9). A battery of standard clinical assessments for EPS along with electromechanical instrumental measures was administered before randomization and again 1 and 3 months postrandomization. Results: We observed significant reduction in parkinsonism (P < 0.001) and akathisia (P = 0.02) based on clinical assessments and dyskinesia (P < 0.05) based on instrumental assessment for the quetiapine group. Subjects remaining on current treatment exhibited an increase in rigidity (P < 0.05) based on instrumental measures. Conclusions: These findings support the switching to quetiapine in the management of preexisting neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects.

However, little is understood about the neural systems underlying auditory-motor integration in the context of musical rhythm, or the enhanced ability of musicians to execute precisely timed sequences. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated how performance and neural activity were modulated as musicians and nonmusicians tapped in synchrony with progressively more complex and less metrically structured auditory rhythms. A functionally connected network was implicated in extracting higher-order features of a rhythm's temporal structure, with the dorsal premotor cortex mediating these auditory-motor interactions. In contrast to past studies, musicians recruited the prefrontal cortex to a greater degree than nonmusicians, whereas secondary motor regions were recruited to the same extent. We argue that the superior ability of musicians to deconstruct and organize a rhythm's temporal structure relates to the greater involvement of the prefrontal cortex mediating working memory.

Leptin resistance during pregnancy in the rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						pregnancy; leptin resistance; hypothalamus	DIET-INDUCED OBESITY; MESSENGER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; BODY-WEIGHT REGULATION; MELANOCORTIN AGONIST; SERUM LEPTIN; RECEPTOR EXPRESSION; SIGNAL TRANSDUCER; SIBERIAN HAMSTER; ARCUATE NUCLEUS	The adipose-derived hormone leptin primarily acts in the hypothalamus to decrease appetite and increase energy expenditure, thereby maintaining body fat levels around a set point. Pregnancy is a physiological state where this feedback mechanism is not beneficial. Successful reproductive efforts are highly demanding on the resources of the mother; thus, it is imperative that the maternal body can increase energy stores without restraint. Food intake, fat mass and serum leptin concentrations increase during pregnancy in the rat, suggesting that the feedback loop between adipose tissue and appetite is disrupted and a state of leptin resistance exists. In support of this, there is an attenuation of the satiety response to exogenous leptin administration in pregnant rats. This state of leptin resistance is associated with impaired activation of the leptin-induced Janus activating kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathway in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) and arcuate nucleus, and reduced expression of leptin receptor mRNA in the VMH. Furthermore, pregnant rats do not show a satiety response to exogenous alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone. This model offers the possibility of examining how hypothalamic leptin signalling can be modified in response to changes in physiological conditions.

Resection of brain tumors has been shown to increase patient survival. The extent of the possible resection, however, depends on whether the tumor has invaded brain regions important for motor, sensory, or cognitive processes and whether the brain tissue surrounding the tumor maintains its functional role. The goal of the present Study was to develop new pre- and intraoperative tools to specifically assess the function of the rostral part of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMdr) in 4 patients with brain tumors close to this region. Methods. Using functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging and a task developed to assess accurate selection between competing responses based on conditional rules, the authors preoperatively assessed the function of the PMdr in 4 patients with brain tumors close to this region. In 1 patient, the authors developed an intraoperative procedure to assess performance on the task during the tumor resection. Results. Preoperative fMR imaging data showed specific activity increases in the vicinity of the tumors, that is, in the PMdr. As confirmed by postoperative structural MR imaging, the extent of the tumor resection was optimal and the functional region within the PMdr was preserved. Furthermore, patients exhibited no postoperative deficits during task performance, demonstrating that the function was preserved. Intraoperative behavioral results demonstrated that the cognitive processes underlying performance on the task remained intact throughout the tumor resection. Conclusions. These findings suggest that preoperative fMR imaging, together with intraoperative behavioral evaluation, may be a useful paradigm to assist neurosurgeons in preserving cognitive function in patients with brain tumors.

Modulation of mechanical and thermal nociceptive sensitivity in the laboratory mouse by behavioral state	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						pain; arousal; attention; sleep; ethogram; grooming	NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SLEEP; RAT; DETERMINANTS; STRAINS; HERITABILITY; ENVIRONMENT; THRESHOLD; ANALGESIA; GENOTYPE	Experienced basic (rodent) pain researchers appreciate the influence of subject behavior during nociceptive testing, but such factors are not commonly reported and have not been systematically studied. We examined here the modulatory effect of behavioral state (grooming, alert, resting, light sleep, deep sleep) on thermal and mechanical sensitivity on the radiant heat paw-withdrawal and von Frey tests, respectively, in 3 mouse strains (CD-1, C57BL/6, and 129P3) with or without neuropathic injury. We find that in all 3 strains, grooming mice are relatively hypoalgesic, and robustly so in the von Frey test such that even the largest usable fibers are met with indifference. This grooming-related "hypoalgesia" persists after spared nerve injury. This finding is problematic for algesiometric testing in the mouse due to the considerable time mice spend grooming (especially. on a glass floor), and ethograms of mouse behavior within plexiglas testing cubicles are provided as evidence of this. Alone among the 3 strains tested, C57BL/6 mice also display robust relative hypoalgesia in deep sleep. Failure to consider behavioral state changes while testing may needlessly increase variability within and between experiments and lead to inaccurate conclusions in transgenic knockout studies of pain. Perspective: State of arousal and attention are important modulators of pain sensitivity in humans. In this report, we find evidence that these same factors influence nociceptive sensitivity in the laboratory mouse, providing a model for understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of these forms of modulation.

To identify SH2B beta-regulated genes critical for neurite outgrowth, we performed microarray analysis of control PC12 cells and PC12 cells stably overexpressing SH2B beta (PC12-SH2B beta) or the dominant-negative SH2B beta(R555E) [PC12-SH2B beta(R555E)]. NGF-induced microarray expression of Plaur and Mmp10 genes was greatly enhanced in PC12-SH2B beta cells, whereas NGF-induced Plaur and Mmp3 expression was substantially depressed in PC12-SH2B beta(R555E) cells. Plaur, Mmp3, and Mmp10 are among the 12 genes most highly upregulated after 6 h of NGF. Their protein products [urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), and MMP10] lie in the same pathway of extracellular matrix degradation; uPAR has been shown previously to be critical for NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed SH2B beta enhancement of NGF induction of all three genes and the suppression of NGF induction of all three when endogenous SH2Bwas reduced using short hairpin RNA against SH2Band in PC12-SH2B beta(R555E) cells. NGF-induced levels of uPAR and MMP3/10 and neurite outgrowth through Matrigel (MMP3-dependent) were also increased in PC12-SH2B beta cells. These results suggest that SH2B beta stimulates NGF-induced neuronal differentiation at least in part by enhancing expression of a specific subset of NGF-sensitive genes, including Plaur, Mmp3, and/or Mmp10, required for neurite outgrowth.

The natural agonists atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP) bind and activate NPRA, leading to cyclic GMP production, which is responsible for their role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Previous studies suggested that stabilization of a dimeric form of NPRA by agonist is essential for receptor activation. However, ligand specificity and sequential steps of this dimerization process have not been investigated. We used radioligand binding, fluorescence resonance energy transfer homoquenching, and molecular modeling to characterize the interaction of human NPRA-ECD with ANP, BNP, the superagonist (Arg(10), Leu(12), Ser(17), Leu(18))-rANP-(1-28), the minimized analog mini-ANP and the antagonist (Arg(6), beta-cyclohexyl-Ala(8), D-Tic(16), Arg(17), Cys(18))-rANP-(6-18)-amide (A71915). ANP binds to preformed ECD dimers and spontaneous dimerization is the rate-limiting step of the ligand binding process. All the studied peptides, including A71915 antagonist, induce a dose-dependent fluorescence homoquenching, specific to dimerization, with potencies highly correlated with their binding affinities. A71915 induced more quenching than other peptides, suggesting stabilization by the antagonist of ECD dimer in a distinct inactive conformation. In summary, these results indicate that the ligand-induced dimerization process of NPRA is different from that for cytokine receptor model. Agonists or antagonists bind to preformed dimeric ECD, leading to dimer stabilization in an active or inactive conformation, respectively. Furthermore, the highly sensitive fluorescence assay designed to assess dimerization could serve as a powerful tool for further detailing the kinetic steps involved in natriuretic peptide receptor binding and activation.

Using a lipid raft-based proteomic approach, we identified ALCAM as an adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). ALCAM expressed on BBB endothelium localized together with CD6 on leukocytes and with BBB endothelium transmigratory cups. ALCAM expression on BBB cells was upregulated in active multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis lesions. Moreover, ALCAM blockade restricted the transmigration of CD4(+) lymphocytes and monocytes across BBB endothelium in vitro and in vivo and reduced the severity and delayed the time of onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our findings indicate an important function for ALCAM in the recruitment of leukocytes into the brain and identify ALCAM as a potential target for the therapeutic dampening of neuroinflammation.

Detection of the bladder volume from the neural afferent activities in dogs: experimental results	NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						bladder volume; electroneurograms; low-noise amplifier; real-time measurement; recording afferent neural signal; tripolar cuff electrodes	PELVIC NERVE; STIMULATOR; IMPEDANCE	Objective: We evaluate the bladder volume and pressure through recording the bladder afferent activity in the sacral nerve roots in acute experiments of paraplegic dogs. These measurements are intended to report the status of the bladder and to adjust the stimulation parameters of an implantable electric stimulator. Methods: The extraction of neural information for feedback in functional electrical stimulation is limited by the poor signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the sacral nerve recordings. We propose to inject a very low amplitude sinusoidal current with high SNR to the bladder through the nerve using a tripolar cuff electrode wrapped around the S2 nerve root. The application of this current (0.4 mu A peak to peak, 30 Hz) allows detecting bladder afferent activity in its amplitude and the tissues impedance of the nerve. Acute experiments in dogs were performed to evaluate the proposed method. In each dog, the bladder infusion with sane was carried out at both slow and high filling rates. At the same time, the changes in the amplitude of the sinusoidal output voltage V-OUT were recorded through the cuff nerve electrode. Results: The data obtained from 26 acute experiments using eight dogs demonstrate that the amplitude of the recorded sinusoidal voltage V-OUT varies proportionally with the bladder pressure during the bladder filling with saline solution. It also demonstrates that the bladder volume can be estimated from the increasing amplitude of the recorded V-OUT. Conclusion: This study shows that the increase in the V-OUT is proportionally related to the increase in bladder pressure. The difference between the record V-OUT during the bladder filling and the baseline V-OUT can be a useful indicator of the changes in the bladder volume.

Similar presentations in reported PDH-deficient patients were searched for using the Medline database. Results: Both patients had PDH deficiency caused by a new mutation (G585C) in the PDHA1 gene, which is predicted to replace a highly conserved glycine at codon 195 by alanine. Although this mutation lies within the thiamine pyrophosphate binding domain, there was no thiamine responsiveness in vivo. The patients presented recurrent episodes of acute isolated ataxia in infancy. Both had normal blood and CSF lactate levels. Although symptoms initially resolved between episodes during the first decade, both patients subsequently worsened and developed progressive and severe encephalopathy, leading to death in their twenties. The spectrum of intermittent presentations in PDH deficiency includes episodic ataxia, intermittent peripheral weakness, recurrent dystonia and extrapyramidal movement disorders. Conclusions: PDH deficiency should be considered in patients with unexplained intermittent and recurrent acute neurological symptoms. Long-term prognosis and outcome remain uncertain. PDH deficiency can occur even with normal CSF lactate concentration.	[Debray, F. -G.; Lambert, M.; Mitchell, G.

Modulation of utrophin A mRNA stability in fast versus slow muscles via an AU-rich element and calcineurin signaling	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							DYSTROPHIN-RELATED PROTEIN; 3' UNTRANSLATED REGION; MOUSE SKELETAL-MUSCLE; GA-BINDING-PROTEIN; N-BOX MOTIF; GENE-EXPRESSION; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; NEURAL REGULATION	We examined the role of post-transcriptional mechanisms in controlling utrophin A mRNA expression in slow versus fast skeletal muscles. First, we determined that the half-life of utrophin A mRNA is significantly shorter in the presence of proteins isolated from fast muscles. Direct plasmid injection experiments using reporter constructs containing the full-length or truncated variants of the utrophin 3'UTR into slow soleus and fast extensor digitorum longus muscles revealed that a region of 265 nucleotides is sufficient to confer lower levels of reporter mRNA in fast muscles. Further analysis of this region uncovered a conserved AU-rich element (ARE) that suppresses expression of reporter mRNAs in cultured muscle cells. Moreover, stability of reporter mRNAs fused to the utrophin full-length 3'UTR was lower in the presence of fast muscle protein extracts. This destabilization effect seen in vivo was lost upon deletion of the conserved ARE. Finally, we observed that calcineurin signaling affects utrophin A mRNA stability through the conserved ARE. These results indicate that ARE-mediated mRNA decay is a key mechanism that regulates expression of utrophin A mRNA in slow muscle fibers. This is the first demonstration of ARE-mediated mRNA decay regulating the expression of a gene associated with the slow myogenic program.

The prognosis for children with brain stem glioma remains grim. Based on studies suggesting efficacy of vincristine and oral VP-16, The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG, now part of the Children's Oncology Group) conducted a study using these agents in combination with standard external beam radiation for children with newly diagnosed brain stem glioma. Methods. Children were eligible for the study if they 3-21 years of age, had MRI-evidence of a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, and had neurologic deficits of <6 months duration. Patients received local radiotherapy to a dosage of 54 Gy. Chemotherapy consisted of two 28-day cycles of vincristine, 1.5 mg/m(2), days 1, 8, and 15 and oral VP-16, 50 mg/m(2), days 1-21, starting concurrent with radiation, and continuing for ten cycles following radiation. Results. Of the 31 children enrolled, 30 were eligible and evaluable for survival and toxicity. Their median age was 8 years (range 3-14 years). Seven patients (23%) had a partial response following radiation, 18 (60%) had stable disease, 2 (7%) had progressive disease, and response in 3 patients (10%) was not measured. All 30 children have died. Overall survival at I year was 27 7% and at 2 years, 3 +/- 2%. The median survival was 9 months (range 3-36 months). Hematologic toxicity was significant; other toxicities included constipation, mucositis, emesis, and infection. Conclusion. The addition of vincristine and oral VP-16 to standard external beam radiation causes moderate toxicity and does not improve survival of children with diffuse intrinsic brain stem glioma.

A phase II study of imatinib mesylate in children with refractory or relapsed solid tumors: A children's oncology group study	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						children; imatinib; desmoplastic small round cell; neuroblastoma; sarcoma	TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR; CHRONIC MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; ROUND-CELL TUMOR; GROWTH FACTOR-AA; C-KIT; IN-VITRO; PHILADELPHIA-CHROMOSOME; EXPRESSION; SARCOMA; CANCER	Background. Imatinib mesylate is a small molecule inhibitor of certain tyrosine kinases, most notably the chimeric bcr-abl fusion protein found in CML. It also inhibits KIT and PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases in vitro. Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, desmoplastic small round cell, and synovial sarcomas often over-express KIT or the PDGF receptor. A phase 11 Study of imatinib in children and young adults with select solid tumors was performed. Procedure. Patients less than 30 years of age with refractory or recurrent Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, desmoplastic small round cell, synovial sarcomas or GIST were eligible. Imatinib was administered daily for 28 day courses at a dose of 440 mg/m(2)/day. Responses were assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST). Results. Seventy eligible patients, 48 male and 22 female, were enrolled and 59 were evaluable for response. Only one partial response was seen among 24 patients with Ewing sarcoma. There were no other objective responses. Hemorrhagic pleural effusions occurred in seven patients with pulmonary lesions, four of whom had progressive disease at the time of the hemorrhage. Intratumoral bleeding was reported in three additional patients. Conclusion. Imatinib as a single agent at a dose of 440 mg/m(2)/day demonstrated little or no activity as a single agent in children with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, or desmoplastic small round cell tumors.

These disorders are characterized by a prominent genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity that can make them challenging and bewildering to understand. This systematic review attempts to categorize these disorders according to their predominant clinical manifestations (i.e., myotonia, weakness, migraine, ataxia, epilepsy, and movement disorders) within the context of what is presently known about the molecular basis of recognized clinical syndromes. Areas of both genetic and phenotypic overlap are highlighted. The review is intended to assist clinicians in enhancing their diagnostic acumen and in targeting specific genetic tests.

CDF Collaboration	Search for Standard Model Higgs Bosons Produced in Association with W Bosons	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								We report on the results of a search for standard model Higgs bosons produced in association with W bosons from p ($p) over bar collisions at root s = 1.96 TeV. The search uses a data sample corresponding to approximately 1 fb(-1) of integrated luminosity. Events consistent with the W -> lvand H -> b (b) over bar signature are selected by triggering on a high-p(T) electron or muon candidate and tagging one or two of the jet candidates as having originated from b quarks. A neural network filter rejects a fraction of tagged charm and light-flavor jets, increasing the b-jet purity in the sample. We observe no excess lvb (b) over bar production beyond the background expectation, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction sigma(p ($) over bar -> WH)Br(H -> b (b) over bar) ranging from 3.9 to 1.3 pb, for specific Higgs boson mass hypotheses in the range 110 to 150 GeV/c(2), respectively.

These proteins are important regulators of the fate of their target mRNAs. In human cells, Staufen1 and Staufen2 proteins, coded by two different genes, are double-stranded RNA-binding proteins involved in several cellular functions including mRNA localization, translation, and decay. Although 51% identical, these proteins are nevertheless found in different RNA particles. In addition, differential splicing events generate Staufen2 isoforms that only differ at their N-terminal extremities. In this paper, we used a genome-wide approach to identify and compare the mRNA targets of mammalian Staufen proteins. The mRNA content of Staufen mRNPs was identified by probing DNA microarrays with probes derived from mRNAs isolated from immunopurified Staufen-containing complexes following transfection of HEK293T cells with Stau1(5-5)-HA, Stau2(59) -HA, or Stau2(62) -HA expressors. Our results indicate that 7% and 11% of the cellular RNAs expressed in HEK293T cells are found in Stau1- and in Stau2-containing mRNPs, respectively. A comparison of Stau1- and Stau2-containing mRNAs identifies a relatively low percentage of common mRNAs; the percentage of common mRNAs highly increases when mRNAs in Stau2(59)-HA- and Stau2(62) -containing mRNPs are compared. There is a predominance of mRNAs involved in cell metabolism, transport, transcription, regulation of cell processes, and catalytic activity. All these subsets of mRNAs are mostly distinct from those associated with FMRP or IMP, although some mRNAs overlap. Consistent with a model of post-transcriptionnal gene regulation, our results show that Stau1- and Stau2-mRNPs associate with distinct but overlapping sets of cellular mRNAs.

The focus of this article is on aspects of the human immune response that have been implicated in the MS disease process and, as a corollary, represent rational targets for the development of safe and effective therapies: Much of the thinking about immune pathophysiology in patients with MS has been shaped by studies in animal models of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Translation to the human disease has continued to pose challenges. A simplified model of MS immune pathophysiology is presented to illustrate the basic principles by which peripheral immune activation, as well as compartmentalized immune responses within the CNS, is likely to impact the disease process and to identify the putative sites of action of current and future MS treatments.

Allostatic load is a timely, potentially useful tool to measure the degree in which the body's physiological function is outside of optimal range. As with most biomarkers early on in development, there are sound opportunities to advance methods that will help understand the etiology of allostatic load and allow it to become more accurately measured. We present a biomarker development framework that should aid in furthering measurement of allostatic load, emphasizing the importance of biomarker measurement accuracy, standardization of methods, and relevance to clinically meaningful outcomes.

The proportion of cells responding to auditory and somatosensory stimulation and the receptive field properties of single neurons were assessed in both normal and enucleated rats. As expected, in enucleated rats there was a drastic increase in the number of unresponsive units and visual responses could no longer be evoked. Most importantly, the proportion of cells that responded to auditory stimulation was drastically reduced. However, the few cells that remained responsive to auditory stimulation were well tuned to noise stimuli presented in both azimuth and elevation, principally in the contralateral hemifield. Enucleation also increased the proportion of cells responding to somatosensory stimulation, particularly to the vibrissae. Implications in terms of neural plasticity and functionality are discussed.

However, PV ablation procedures also can affect intracardiac autonomic ganglia. The present study examined the relative role of PVs versus peri-PV autonomic ganglia in an experimental vagal AF model. Methods and Results - Cholinergic AF was studied under carbachol infusion in coronary perfused canine left atrial PV preparations in vitro and with cervical vagal stimulation in vivo. Carbachol caused dose-dependent AF promotion in vitro, which was not affected by excision of all PVs. Sustained AF could be induced easily in all dogs during vagal nerve stimulation in vivo both before and after isolation of all PVs with encircling lesions created by a bipolar radiofrequency ablation clamp device. PV elimination had no effect on atrial effective refractory period or its responses to cholinergic stimulation. Autonomic ganglia were identified by bradycardic and/or tachycardic responses to high-frequency subthreshold local stimulation. Ablation of the autonomic ganglia overlying all PV ostia suppressed the effective refractory period - abbreviating and AF-promoting effects of cervical vagal stimulation, whereas ablation of only left-or right-sided PV ostial ganglia failed to suppress AF. Dominant-frequency analysis suggested that the success of ablation in suppressing vagal AF depended on the elimination of high-frequency driver regions. Conclusions - Intact PVs are not needed for maintenance of experimental cholinergic AF. Ablation of the autonomic ganglia at the base of the PVs suppresses vagal responses and may contribute to the effectiveness of PV-directed ablation procedures in vagal AF.

Neuromyelitis optica-IgG in childhood inflammatory demyelinating CNS disorders	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; TRANSVERSE MYELITIS; GUIDELINES; MARKER	Objective: To determine seroprevalence of neuromyelitis optica (NMO)-IgG in childhood CNS inflammatory demyelinating disorders. Methods: We analyzed demographic, clinical, and radiologic data in a blinded fashion and assessed serum NMO-IgG status for 87 children: 41 with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), 17 with NMO, 13 with monophasic/recurrent optic neuritis (ON), 13 with transverse myelitis, of whom 10 were longitudinally extensive on MRI spine (LETM), and another 3 with LETM in the context of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Results: Ten of the 87 children (11%) were seropositive. Eight of 17 with NMO (47%) were seropositive (7 of 9 with relapsing NMO [78%], 1 of 8 with monophasic NMO [12.5%]). Two other children were seropositive: 1 of 5 with recurrent ON and one child with recurrent LETM. No seropositive case was identified among 41 with RRMS (14% of whom had LETM at some point in their clinical course), 8 with monophasic ON, 9 with monophasic LETM, or 3 with LETM in the context of ADEM. Conclusions: The similar frequency of neuromyelitis optica (NMO)-IgG in both childhood and adult cases of NMO, and its rarity in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, supports the concept that these diseases have a similar pathogenesis in childhood and adulthood. It is noteworthy that none of nine children with monophasic longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) was NMO-IgG-seropositive. Furthermore, LETM does not appear to be as predictive of an NMO spectrum disorder in children as it is in adults. Longitudinal studies of larger pediatric LETM cohorts are required to ascertain whether the absence of NMO-IgG is a negative predictor for relapse in this childhood entity.	[Lennon, V.

The proprotein convertase PCSK9 induces the degradation of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and its closest family members VLDLR and ApoER2	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AUTOSOMAL-DOMINANT HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA; SECRETED PCSK9; GROWTH-FACTOR; MICE LACKING; MUTATIONS; GENE; CHOLESTEROL; MUTANTS; PATHWAY; OVEREXPRESSION	The proprotein convertase PCSK9 gene is the third locus implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, emphasizing its role in cardiovascular diseases. Loss of function mutations and gene disruption of PCSK9 resulted in a higher clearance of plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol, likely due to a reduced degradation of the liver low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). In this study, we show that two of the closest family members to LDLR are also PCSK9 targets. These include the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) implicated in neuronal development and lipid metabolism. Our results show that wild type PCSK9 and more so its natural gain of function mutant D374Y can efficiently degrade the LDLR, VLDLR, and ApoER2 either following cellular co-expression or re-internalization of secreted human PCSK9. Such PCSK9-induced degradation does not require its catalytic activity. Membrane-bound PCSK9 chimeras enhanced the intracellular targeting of PCSK9 to late endosomes/lysosomes and resulted in a much more efficient degradation of the three receptors. We also demonstrate that the activity of PCSK9 and its binding affinity on VLDLR and ApoER2 does not depend on the presence of LDLR. Finally, in situ hybridization show close localization of PCSK9 mRNA expression to that of VLDLR in mouse postnatal day 1 cerebellum.

NEUROLOGY			English	Article							PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; SPEECH PRODUCTION; EPISODIC MEMORY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; FMRI; RETRIEVAL; DAMAGE	Background: Some neuroimaging studies have suggested that specific right hemispheric regions can compensate deficits induced by left hemispheric lesions in vascular aphasia. In particular, the right inferior frontal cortex might take part in lexical retrieval in patients presenting left-sided lesions involving the homologous area. Objective: To address whether the involvement of the right inferior frontal cortex is either unique to recovering aphasic patients or present also in other circumstances of enrichment of lexical abilities, i.e., in non-brain-damaged subjects over learning of new vocabulary. Methods: Ten post-stroke aphasic patients experiencing word finding difficulties were intensively trained to retrieve object names in French over a 4-week period. Twenty healthy subjects were similarly trained to name these items in either Spanish or English, i.e., foreign languages that they learned at school but did not master. By analogy to aphasic patients, healthy subjects had to work out the phonetic/phonologic representations of long-acquired but forgotten words. Brain activity changes were assessed in two H-2 O-15 PET sessions involving picture naming tasks that were performed before and after training. Results: Comparable post-training performance and changes in regional cerebral blood flow including mainly the right insular and inferior frontal regions were found in both groups. Conclusion: Our results suggest that enhanced activities in right-sided areas observed in recovering aphasia is not the mere consequence of damage to left-sided homologous areas and could reflect the neural correlates of lexical learning also observed in control subjects.

Results demonstrate that both lower-level and higher-level perception continue to develop during school-age years in both dynamic and static domains. When compared with adult levels, dynamic performance for 5-6-year-olds is significantly decreased for SO, but not for the FO perception; however, type of stimulus (FO vs. SO) did not affect the development of static perception. We therefore suggest that levels of stimulus complexity should be considered an important variable when assessing and making inferences regarding the typical and atypical development of static and dynamic perception.

Cryptococcus neoformans induces IL-8 secretion and CXCL1 expression by human bronchial epithelial cells	RESPIRATORY RESEARCH			English	Article							NF-KAPPA-B; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; PULMONARY CRYPTOCOCCOSIS; LUNG EPITHELIUM; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; INNATE IMMUNITY; HOST-DEFENSE; INTERLEUKIN-8; VIRULENCE; GLUCURONOXYLOMANNAN	Background: Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) is a globally distributed fungal pathogen with the potential to cause serious disease, particularly among immune compromised hosts. Exposure to this organism is believed to occur by inhalation and may result in pneumonia and/or disseminated infection of the brain as well as other organs. Little is known about the role of airway epithelial cells in cryptococcal recognition or their ability to induce an inflammatory response. Methods: Immortalized BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells and primary normal human bronchial epithelium (NHBE) were stimulated in vitro with encapsulated or acapsular C. neoformans cultivated at room temperature or 37 C. Activation of bronchial epithelial cells was characterized by analysis of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, transcription factor activation, fungal-host cell association, and host cell damage. Results: Viable C. neoformans is a strong activator of BEAS-2B cells, resulting in the production of the neutrophil chemokine Interleukin (IL)-8 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. IL-8 production was observed only in response to acapsular C. neoformans that was grown at 37 C. C. neoformans was also able to induce the expression of the chemokine CXCL1 and the transcription factor CAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBP/beta) in BEAS-2B cells. NHBE was highly responsive to stimulation with C. neoformans; in addition to transcriptional up regulation of CXCL1, these primary cells exhibited the greatest IL-8 secretion and cell damage in response to stimulation with an acapsular strain of C. neoformans. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that human bronchial epithelial cells mediate an acute inflammatory response to C. neoformans and are susceptible to damage by this fungal pathogen. The presence of capsular polysaccharide and in vitro fungal culture conditions modulate the host inflammatory response to C. neoformans. Human bronchial epithelial cells are likely to contribute to the initial stages of pulmonary host defense in vivo.

Complex wavelets applied to diffuse optical spectroscopy for brain activity detection	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							FRACTIONAL BROWNIAN-MOTION; NEGATIVE BOLD; LINEAR-MODEL; TIME-SERIES; TOMOGRAPHY; ACTIVATION	The analysis of diffuse optical imaging ( DOI) data has seen significant developments over the last few years. When compared to fMRI, signals originating from optical imaging are tainted by more physiology and the separation of activation from this background can be difficult in some cases. In this work, we show that the use of time-frequency techniques based on wavelets distinguish different physiological sources from the evoked response to a given stimulus. In particular, we show that analytical complex wavelets identify synchronies in the signal at different scales. These synchronies are then used to extract activation information from the DOI data in order to estimate the evoked hemodynamic response or to define a new type of contrast between two conditions. This work presents both simulations and applications with real data (visual stimulation and motor tasks experiments). (c) 2008 Optical Society of America.

Electrical stimulation of the SON or microinjection of a small dose of L-glutamate sodium into the SON elevated the nociceptive threshold in a dose-dependent manner, while cauterization of the SON decreased the nociceptive threshold. Pituitary removal did not influence the antinociceptive effect of L-glutamate sodium in the SON. The data suggested that the neurons and not the nervous fibers in the SON played an important role in antinociception. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Newly developed paradigms to investigate stress in neuroimaging environments allow the assessment of brain activation changes in association with the perception of and the metabolic response to stress. Methods: We exposed human subjects to a psychosocial stressor in one positron emission tomography (n = 10) and one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 40) experiment. Results: We observed a profound deactivation of limbic system components including hippocampus, hypothalamus, medio-orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex in subjects who reacted to the stressor with a significant increase of the endocrine stress marker cortisol. Further, in the fMRI study, the degree of deactivation in the hippocampus was correlated with the release of cortisol in response to the stress task. Conclusions: The observed deactivation of limbic system structures suggests elevated activation at rest and during nonstressful situations. A model is proposed where the observed reduction in limbic system activity is essential for the initiation of the stress response.

Data to be compared were first estimated on the same cortical surface and two comparison strategies were used: (1) MEM-concordance: a comparison between EEG sources localized with the Maximum Entropy on the Mean (MEM) method and fMRI clusters showing a significant hemodynamic response. Minimal geodesic distances between local extrema and overlap measurements between spatial extents of EEG sources and fMRI clusters were used to quantify MEM-concordance. (2) fMRI-relevance: estimation of the fMRI-relevance index a quantifying if sources located in an fMRI cluster could explain some scalp EEG data, when this fMRI cluster was used to constrain the EEG inverse problem. Combining MEM-concordance and fMRI-relevance (alpha) indexes, each fMRI cluster showing a significant hemodynamic response (p<0.05 corrected) was classified according to its concordance with EEG data. Nine patients with focal epilepsy who underwent EEG-fMRI examination followed by EEG recording outside the scanner were selected for this study. Among the 62 fMRI clusters analyzed (7 patients), 15 (24%) found in 6 patients were highly concordant with EEG according to both MEM-concordance and fMRI-relevance. EEG concordance was found for 5 clusters (8%) according to et only, suggesting sources missed by the MEM. No concordance with EEG was found for 30 clusters (48%) and for 10 clusters (16%) alpha was significantly negative, suggesting EEG-fMRI discordance. We proposed two complementary strategies to assess and classifv EEG-fMRI concordance. We showed that for most patients, part of the hemodynamic response to spikes was highly concordant with EEG sources, whereas other fMRI clusters in response to the same spikes were found distant or discordant with EEG sources.

In this fMRI study, participants varying in trait anxiety scores viewed a series of superimposed face/scene composite images (containing fearful or neutral faces) and were instructed to direct attention to either the face or the scene content. We observed an interaction between sex and trait anxiety in amygdala responses to fearful faces as a function of allention. In females, higher trait anxiety was associated with a stronger amygdala response to unattended fearful faces, whereas no such relationship was present in mates. This observed interaction between sex and individual differences in trait anxiety at the level of the brain may have clinical implications for a better understanding of the higher incidence of anxiety disorders in women than men.

The B-deficient diet decreased body weight and food intake but increased water ingestion. Relative to either control group, vitamin-B-deficient mice were more active in the open field and in enclosed arms of the elevated plusmaze. However, vitamin-B-deficient mice were not impaired on sensorimotor coordination and spatial learning tests, swimming to a visible platform even faster than either control group. The main effect of this diet restriction was hyperactivity with no change in anxiety, coordination, and memory.

Given that RGCs use superoxide for intracellular signaling after axotomy, and that LHON mutations increase superoxide levels in non-RGC transmitochondrial cybrids, we hypothesized that RGCs regulate superoxide levels differently than other neuronal cells. To study this, we compared superoxide production and mitochondrial electron transport chain (METC) components in isolated RGC mitochondria to mitochondria isolated from cerebral cortex and neuroblastoma SK-N-AS cells. Results: In the presence of the complex I substrate glutamate/malate or the complex II substrate succinate, the rate of superoxide production in RGC-5 cells was significantly lower than cerebral or neuroblastoma cells. Cerebral but not RGC-5 or neuroblastoma cells increased superoxide production in response to the complex I inhibitor rotenone, while neuroblastoma but not cerebral or RGC-5 cells dramatically decreased superoxide production in response to the complex III inhibitor antimycin A. Immunoblotting and real-time quantitative PCR of METC components demonstrated different patterns of expression among the three different sources of neuronal mitochondria. Conclusion: RGC-5 mitochondria produce superoxide at significantly lower rates than cerebral and neuroblastoma mitochondria, most likely as a result of differential expression of complex I components. Diversity in METC component expression and function could explain tissue specificity in diseases associated with inherited mtDNA abnormalities.

Clathrin light chains function in mannose phosphate receptor trafficking via regulation of actin assembly	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						endocytosis; huntingtin-interacting protein; trans-Golgi network	ENDOCYTIC ACCESSORY PROTEINS; SYNAPTIC VESICLE ENDOCYTOSIS; TRANS-GOLGI NETWORK; COATED VESICLES; MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS; BINDING PROTEIN; INTERACTING PROTEIN; 6-PHOSPHATE RECEPTORS; BOVINE BRAIN; IN-VITRO	Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) are major carriers for endocytic cargo and mediate important intracellular trafficking events at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. Whereas clathrin heavy chain provides the structural backbone of the clathrin coat, the role of clathrin light chains (CLCs) is poorly understood. We now demonstrate that CLCs are not required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis but are critical for clathrin-mediated trafficking between the TGN and the endosomal system. Specifically, CLC knockdown (KD) causes the cation-independent mannose-6 phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) to cluster near the TGN leading to a delay in processing of the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D. A recently identified binding partner for CLCs is huntingtin-interacting protein 1-related (HIP1R), which is required for productive interactions of CCVs with the actin cytoskeleton. CLC KD causes mislocalization of HIP1R and overassembly of actin, which accumulates in patches around the clustered CI-IMPR. A dominant-negative CLC construct that disrupts HIP1R/CLC interactions causes similar alterations in CI-MPR trafficking and actin assembly. Thus, in mammalian cells CLCs function in intracellular membrane trafficking by acting as recruitment proteins for HIP1R, enabling HIP1R to regulate actin assembly on clathrin-coated structures.

Receptive field properties and sensitivity to edges defined by motion in the postero-lateral lateral suprasylvian (PLLS) area of the cat	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						extrastriate; kinematogram; PLLS; spatial frequency; texture	MOVING TEXTURE PATTERNS; SIMULATED OPTIC FLOW; SPLIT-CHIASM CATS; CLARE-BISHOP AREA; VISUAL-CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SINGLE NEURONS; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY	The present study investigated the spatial properties of cells in the postero-lateral lateral suprasylvian (PLLS) area of the cat and assessed their sensitivity to edges defined by motion. A total of one hundred and seventeen (117) single units were isolated. First, drifting sinusoidal gratings were used to assess the spatial properties of the cells' receptive fields and to determine their spatial frequency tuning functions. Second, random-dot kinematograms were used to create illusory edges by drifting textured stimuli (i.e. a horizontal bar) against a similarly textured but static background. Almost all the cells recorded in PLLS (96.0%) were binocular, and a substantial majority of receptive fields (79.2%) were end-stopped. Most units (81.0%) had band-pass spatial frequency tuning functions and responded optimally to low spatial frequencies (mean spatial frequency: 0.08 c./degree). The remaining units (19.0%) were low-pass. All the recorded cells responded vigorously to edges defined by motion. The vast majority (96.0%) of cells responded optimally to large texture elements; approximately half the cells (57.3%) also responded to finer texture elements. Moreover, 38.5% of the cells were selective to the width of the bar (i.e., the distance between the leading and the trailing edges). Finally, some (9.0%) cells responded in a transient fashion to leading and to trailing edges. in conclusion, cells in the PLLS area are low spatial frequency analyzers that are sensitive to texture and to the distance between edges defined by motion.

A distractor-prime-target word sequence was presented in each trial. Subjects had to make semantic relatedness judgments on prime-target pairs. in the first experiment, subjects had an additional task. They either had to ignore or to attend to distractors. In critical conditions, that is, when distractors were related to targets, the times to make the prime-target semantic relatedness judgments were longer when subjects had to attend to distractors than when they had to ignore them. In accordance with the inhibition hypothesis, the amplitudes of the N400 elicited by distractors were larger in the ignore than in the attend task. In the second experiment, the same distractor-prime-target triplets were used. However, there was no additional task. Subjects only had to make the prime-target semantic-relatedness judgment. They were then split in two subgroups: the good ignorers, who did not take much longer to make the judgment in critical than in control conditions, and the poor ignorers, that is, those who did take much longer. Results were again consistent with the inhibition idea. The amplitudes of the N400s evoked by distractors were larger in the good than in the poor ignorers. The results of these two studies are taken together to support the idea that N400 index a semantic inhibition rather than an integration effort. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Selective induction of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1-and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5-dependent chemical long-term potentiation at oriens/alveus interneuron synapses of mouse hippocampus	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						inhibitory interneurons; plasticity; mGluR1 knock-out mice; DHPG; MPEP; LY367385	CLIMBING FIBER INNERVATION; CEREBELLAR PURKINJE-CELLS; MICE LACKING MGLUR1; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; STRIATAL NEURONS; IN-VIVO; LTP	Synaptic plasticity in inhibitory interneurons is essential to maintain a proper equilibrium between excitation and inhibition in hippocampal network. Recent studies showed that theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) at excitatory synapses of oriens/alveus (O/A) interneurons in CA1 hippocampal region required the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) 1. However these interneurons also express mGluR5 and the contribution of this receptor subtype in interneuron synaptic plasticity remains unexplored. We combined pharmacological and transgenic approaches to examine the relative contribution of mGluR1/5 in LTP at excitatory synapses on O/A interneurons. Bath-application of the selective mGluR1/5 agonist (s)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) induced LTP of compound excitatory postsynaptic potentials. DHPG-induced LTP was not prevented by application of either mGluR1 or mGluR5 antagonists, was still present in mGluR1 knockout mice, but was blocked by co-application of both antagonists. These results indicate that UP can be induced at O/A interneuron synapses by either mGluR1 or mGluR5 activation. As previously reported for mGluR1-dependent LTP, the mGluR5-dependent UP was independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Pairing DHPG application with postsynaptic depolarization induced GluR1- and mGluR5-dependent LTP of minimally-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents, which were composed of calcium-permeable AMPA receptor and presynaptically modulated by group II mGluRs, hence confirming that both forms of LTP occurred directly at interneuron excitatory synapses. These findings uncover a new mGluR5-dependent form of LTP at O/A interneuron synapses and indicate that activation of mGluR1 or mGluR5 is sufficient to induce UP at these synapses. Thus, a rich repertoire of adaptive changes may take place at these interneuron synapses to regulate hippocampal feedback inhibition. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three-dimensional probabilistic maps of the occipital sulci of the human brain in standardized stereotaxic space	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sulcus; visual-cortex; morphology; lunate; calcarine; atlas	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; MONKEY PRESTRIATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION; RETINOTOPIC MAPS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; AREAS; MOTION; ORGANIZATION	Developments in functional neuroimaging in normal human subjects, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have permitted the mapping of several visual areas of the human brain and have already provided provisional identification of some of the visual areas that were first described in nonhuman primates. However, the lack of a detailed description of the sulcal patterns of the human occipital lobe makes it difficult to establish clear relationships between sulcal landmarks and identified visual areas with functional neuroimaging. In the present study we used magnetic resonance images to investigate the morphological variation of the human occipital sulci in both the left and right hemispheres of 40 normal adult human brains. We identified 11 occipital sulci, the parieto-occipital fissure and the temporo-occipital incisure, and their corresponding gray matter voxels were marked in the magnetic resonance volumes which had been transformed into the Montreal Neurological Institute standard proportional stereotaxic space. Probability maps were then constructed for each occipital sulcus. These probability maps provide a quantitative measure of the variability of the occipital sulci in standard stereotaxic space and are a useful tool to identify the location of voxels of other magnetic resonance imaging images transformed in the same stereotaxic space.

This learning scheme uses an exhaustive search over the fuzzy partitions of involved variables, automatic fuzzy hypotheses generation, formulation and testing, and approximation procedure of Min-Max relational equations. The main idea is to start learning from coarse fuzzy partitions of the involved variables (both input and output) and proceed progressively toward fine-grained partitions until finding the appropriate partitions that fit the data. According to the complexity of the problem at hand, it learns the whole structure of the fuzzy system, i.e. conjointly appropriate fuzzy partitions, appropriate fuzzy rules, their number and their associated membership functions.

SPECT IMAGE RESTORATION VIA RECURSIVE INVERSE FILTERING CONSTRAINED BY A PROBABILISTIC MRI ATLAS	2008 15TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOLS 1-5	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing ICIP		English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2008)	OCT 12-15, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		SPECT imagery; MR imagery; 3D blind deconvolution; probabilistic MRI atlas; 3D/3D registration; image restoration; information fusion	AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION; BLIND DECONVOLUTION; BRAIN	3D Brain SPECT imagery is a well established functional imaging method which has become a great help to physicians in the diagnosis of several neurological and cerebrovascular diseases. However, mainly due to the effects of attenuation and the scattering of emitted photons, inherent to this imaging process, 3D SPECT images are generally blurred and exhibit poor spatial resolution. This leads to substantial errors in measurements of regional brain blood flow, and therefore in the estimations of brain activity. In order to improve the resolution of these images and then to facilitate their interpretation, we herein propose an original extension of the NAS-RIF (Recursive Inverse Filtering) deconvolution technique proposed by Kundur and Hatzinakos [1]. The proposed extension allows to efficiently integrate, in the deconvolution process, a set of soft constraints given by a probabilistic MRI atlas containing experts's prior knowledge about the spatial localization of the different brain structures (or tissue classes). This extension has three interesting properties; first it allows to exploit (or fuse) reliable anatomical and (high resolution) geometrical information extracted from a probabilistic 3D MRI atlas. Second, it allows to incorporate, into the NAS-RIF method, a regularization term which efficiently stabilizes the inverse solution. Third and contrary to multi-modal restoration techniques, it does not require a MRI scan of the patient. This method has been successfully tested on numerous real brain SPECT images (of different patients suffering from epilepsy), yielding promising restoration results.

Commonly encountered modeling techniques include empirical formulae, equivalent circuits, and black-box models. Important criteria in device modeling are model accuracy, computational simplicity, generality of the modeling approach, etc. In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional CAD algorithm to device modeling based on a concept often referred to as binning. For a given set of data either from measurements or simulations, the proposed algorithm leads to an accurate model comprising of a set of sub-models with best possible accuracy, while keeping the model structure simple. The algorithm is general and can be applied in the context of any black-box modeling technique; however, we demonstrate multidimensional neural modeling of active and passive components. Resulting models are shown to exhibit relatively better accuracies compared to those developed via standard modeling approaches.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage protein secondary structure prediction technique, implemented using neural network models. The first neural network stage of the proposed technique associates the input protein sequence to a bin containing its corresponding homologues. The second stage predicts the secondary structure of the input sequence utilizing a neural prediction model specific to the bin obtained from stage one. The strategy of binning allows for simplified and accurate neural models. This technique is implemented on the RS126 dataset and its prediction accuracy is compared with that of the standard PHD approach.	[Kakumani, Rajasekhar; Devabbaktuni, Vijay; Ahmad, M.

To unveil mechanisms accounting for skilled performance under a wide range of rapidly switching task dynamics conditions, we recorded neural data from the primary motor-cortex (M1). Here we present a systematic analysis of changes in the M1 activity of a monkey with extensive practice compensating for five different dynamic fields in an elbow flexion/extension task. We show how they reflect differences in task kinematics and dynamics. Making extensive use of principal component analysis (PCA) and in preparation for computational modeling (see the companion paper) we demonstrate how M1 activity can be related functionally to the dynamics of feed-forward (FF), fast- and slow- feedback (FB) loops of the adaptive controller implemented by the brain to guide skilled motor behavior.

However, it may be simplistic to assume most control intelligence is in the cortex while the brainstem and especially the spinal cord do little more than passively implement pontifical descending commands. More recent studies like [14] do suggest a different perspective. Furthermore, systematic changes in directionality of M1 cell and limb muscle EMG activity may stem partly from the feedback (aka reflex) loops, physical properties of limb biomechanics, muscle anisotropy and force production nonlinearities, and their interplay with task conditions, and not only due to predictive feedforward central commands. M1 specifies joint torques via already existing reticular and spinal networks. The latter are already quite specialized in movement and force production. Hence a key to unveiling the M1 functional role is to look at its contribution to the robustness of motor control. This is an alternative perspective, quite different from the traditional view that M1 neurons are "upper motoneurons" replicating the functionality already existing in lower-level motor circuits. We argue that robustness may be achieved by neural implementation of control principles [14] that perform reasonably well in a wide range of behavioral tasks and dynamic conditions even at a first encounter. We adopt a minimalist view at the possibilities offered by clearly observable functionality and anatomical connectivity. We also use key results from a related field - the study of eye movement control and vestibulo-ocular interactions. Following Marr's methodology, we then return to anatomy and match the acquired modeling insights onto their possible implementation in neural hardware. Finally, we validate the approach against the dynamics and primate neurophysiology observed in three experimental studies of skilled arm-reaching [7,9-10].

The theory, developed in the context of learning a prior model of natural images, has been applied successfully to the synthesis of textures and shapes, and to pattern classification. The basic parameter estimation algorithm rests on gradient algorithm following the maximization under constraints of an entropy criterion. The purpose of this study is to investigate a Gibbsian Kohonen neural network, a Kohonen network which can learn these constrained maximum entropy Gibbs density parameters for pattern representation and classification.

The application of Kalman filtering has the advantage of using information about the mobile's motion to reduce location errors (caused by the WLAN received signal strength- RSS variations) and to avoid trajectory discontinuities (caused by the static estimation of the ANN-based fingerprinting technique). To process the RSS-based fingeprinting location technique, two ANN-based pattern-matching algorithms have been examined: the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and they have been compared to the classic K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method. Experimental results, conducted in a specific in-building environment, showed that the GRNN algorithm performs better than the MLP and KNN algorithms. The application of Kalman filtering to the considered GRNN-based fingerprinting location technique improved the location accuracy of about 22.4% in terms of location mean error.

The enhancement method consists of the particle filter application to an artificial neural network (ANN) based fingerprinting technique combined with a low-cost sensor (compass). The application of the particle filter has the advantage of using information about the mobile's motion to reduce location errors (caused by the WLAN received signal strength-RSS variations) and to avoid mobile's trajectory discontinuities (caused by the static estimation of the fingerprinting technique). A digital compass has been added to the fingerprinting system to observe the mobile's heading and then improve the trajectory orientation. To apply the filtering process, two models have been proposed: non-linear and linearized filtering models. The first model is obtained from the characterization of the pedestrian's motion with the heading observation. The second model is obtained after the replacement of the heading variable, in the first model, by the pedestrian's velocities along the x and v axes. Experimental results, conducted in a specific in-building environment, showed that the application of the particle filter to the ANN-based fingerprinting system mounted with a compass improves the location accuracy, in terms of mean error, of about 39% and 50% for the cases of non-linear and linearized filtering models, respectively.

Also, a compact voltage squarer pre-processor is introduced to emphasize neural APs prior to detection. The proposed circuits were implemented in a CMOS 0.18-mu m process and achieve ultra low-power consumption. Both circuits have been validated in simulations with synthetic neural waveforms.

The goal is to determine the occurrence of a fault in any one of the multiple thrusters that are employed in the attitude control subsystem of a satellite, and further to localize which PPT is faulty. In order to accomplish these objectives, a multilayer perceptron network embedded with dynamic neurons is proposed.

Their potential for incremental learning of new blocks of training data, after previously been trained, is assessed in terms of generalization error and resource requirements, for several synthetic pattern recognition problems. The advantages and drawbacks of these architectures are discussed for incremental learning with different data block sizes and data set structures. Overall results indicate that Gaussian ARTMAP is the more suitable for incremental learning as it usually provides an error rate that is comparable to that of batch learning for the data sets, and for a wide range of training block sizes. The better performance is a result of the representation of categories as Gaussian distributions, and of using category-specific learning rate that decreases during the training process. With all the data sets, the error rate obtained by training through incremental learning is usually significantly higher than through batch learning for fuzzy ARTMAP. Training fuzzy ARTMAP and Gaussian ARTMAP through incremental learning often requires fewer training epochs to converge, and leads to more compact networks.

Nowadays imaging technology for real-time endovascular tool navigation consists of digital fluoroscopy detectors mounted on C-shaped arms with multiple orientations capability. In theory, a 3D representation of interventional devices (guide wire, coils) can be done using biplane fluoroscopic acquisitions. This approach opens the door to a real 3D road-map guidance of endovascular procedure. However, it is important that the tool be precisely identified during an intervention on the low contrast and low resolution fluoroscopic images. Therefore, a new method for segmenting guide wires and coils on fluoroscopic images is presented. A line enhancement algorithm based on Hessian matrix is applied and line candidates are marked by simple thresholding. Line artifacts are suppressed according to geometric criterion. The remaining line segments are linked when appropriately aligned to assemble continuous tools regardless of crossing from the projection of a planar view. This identifying method is evaluated on in vivo fluoroscopic sequences acquired during endovascular interventions on patients with cerebral aneurysm.

However, the use of in vivo imaging markers requires extensive validation against gold standard, ex vivo tissue studies. In this paper, we describe methods for three-dimensional reconstruction of two-dimensional serial histological sections to create volumetric data, a major step in the use of ex vivo data for validating in vivo imaging techniques.

To process such rest acquisitions, exploratory methods such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) are of particular interest. Yet, while successfully applied at the individual level, existing ICA methods still fail to provide robust functional network detection at the group level. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting group functional large-scale networks in fMRI using ICA, which allows to systematically control the consistency of the group results with the individual ones. This approach, called NEDICA (NEtwork Detection using ICA), was applied on resting-state data from twenty healthy subjects and the robustness of the resulting networks was assessed by a bootstrap sampling procedure. We found seven functional networks that were very representative of the population and highly reproducible on the basis of bootstrap tests. These results were in good agreement with the existing literature and confirmed the ability of fMRI to noninvasively reveal large-scale interactions in the brain.

However, the in-vivo visualization of subcortical neurosurgical targets has typically involved the warping of subcortical atlases or T2- and diffusion-weighted imaging techniques to help define the anatomical borders. We propose a novel vibrotactile stimulation technique to activate the somatosensory pathway, and particularly the sensory thalamus. Experiments were executed on two MRI scanners (1.5T and 3.0T). A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that statistically significant functional activations of the sensory thalamus can be in achieved in clinically acceptable time (32 minutes at 1.5T and 12 minutes at 3.0T), thus enabling this technique to be used for pre-operative planning in patients.

Small FCD lesions are difficult to distinguish from non-lesional cortex and remain often overlooked on radiological NMI inspection. This paper presents a method to detect small FCD lesions on T1-MRI relying on surface-based features: cortical thickness, gradient magnitude at the white-matter / grey-matter interface, cortical signal intensity, curvature and depth of inner-cortical surface. These features best describe the visual and morphometric characteristics of small FCD, and allow differentiating it from healthy tissues. The automatic detection was performed by a neural-network bagging trained on manual labels. The method was tested on 19 patients with small FCD and identified the lesion in 89% (17/19) of cases. Cluster analysis demonstrated that the lesional cluster was the largest in 76% (13/17) of identified cases. This new approach may assist the presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable epilepsy, especially those with "MRI-negative" epilepsy.

Virtual reality environments have been postulated to increase the participant's level of engagement and motivation in performing motor tasks. We evaluated motivation and presence in two groups of healthy participants (<25 yrs old; >= 25yrs old) performing similar reaching tasks in four different environments - physical, 2D virtual reality, 3D virtual reality and video game. Sense of presence and motivation in each environment were assessed. Overall, the participants rated the video gaming environment as being the most motivating and enjoyable. The level of presence was related to motivation for the younger group only for the 2D VR environment but for all three VR environments in the older group. Our findings suggest that training environments can be made more motivating using virtual reality which is an important factor in maximizing motor recovery in neurological patients. Further research is needed to develop highly motivating applications suited to specific rehabilitation goals and patient needs.

They have led to a number of robust findings about the effect of modified task dynamics onto movement kinematics and motor skill acquisition. A number of controversial findings are related to the role of peripheral reflexes and the effect of practice on motor learning, adaptation, and consolidation A related issue is whether the brain actually uses strategies similar to engineering optimal control. Finally, aspects that typically do not get much attention are the roles of subject motivation and the functional relevance of the task to daily activity. Here we introduce a suite of virtual environments for motor skill acquisition, running on ubiquitous highly affordable and portable PC hardware. We explore case studies in both a research and a rehabilitation context, and suggest that our observations are compatible with theory by N.A.Bernstein [1] according to which the brain may perform feasibility search. Unlike a robotic system, the brain tries to achieve solutions to the behavioral tasks that satisfy imposed constraints, even if not yet optimal. When more than one solution is identified, the brain retains the better one for future use In comparison, a robotic system would search (depth- or width-first) throughout the whole parameter space. This difference is not unlike the one between a grand-waster and a chess playing program. Based on a rich variety of acquired behavioral data, we demonstrate clearly that the virtual environments we introduced here have a very large potential to: 1) Reproduce individually targeted elements of motor behavior, which are functionally relevant in everyday life; 2) Drive incremental re-acquisition of increasingly complex and adapted motor programs; 3) Achieve the latter goal by selectively augmenting or suppressing particular strategies depending on their compatibility with residual and readapted patient capacity at a particular point of the rehabilitation process.

Neurophysiological signals and especially electroencephalogram (EEG) are the forms of brain electrical activity which can be easily captured and utilized for BCI/BMI applications. Those signals are unfortunately highly contaminated by noise due to a very low level of electrophysiological signals and presence of different devices in the environment creating electromagnetic interference. In the proposed approach we first decompose each of the recorded channels, in multichannel EEG recording environment, into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) which are a result of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) extended to multichannel analysis in this paper. We present novel and interesting results on human mental and cognitive states estimation based on analysis of the above mentioned stimuli-related IMF components.

Dynamic Neural Network-Based Pulsed Plasma Thruster (PPT) Fault Detection and Isolation for Formation Flying of Satellites	ADVANCED INTELLIGENT COMPUTING THEORIES AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS: WITH ASPECTS OF CONTEMPORARY INTELLIGENT COMPUTING TECHNIQUES	COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Intelligent Computing	SEP 15-18, 2008	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA			fault detection and isolation; dynamic neural networks; formation flying; pulsed plasma thrusters		The main objective of this paper is to develop a dynamic neural network-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme for the Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPTs) that are used in the Attitude Control Subsystem (ACS) of satellites that are tasked to perform a formation flying mission. By using data collected from the relative attitudes of the formation flying satellites our proposed "High Level" FDI scheme can detect the pair of thrusters which is faulty, however fault isolation cannot be accomplished. Based on the "High Level" FDI scheme and the DNN-based "Low Level" FDI scheme developed earlier by the authors, an "Integrated" DNN-based FDI scheme is then proposed. To demonstrate the FDI capabilities of the proposed schemes various fault scenarios are simulated.

Although the functional consequences of such remodelling remain hypothetical, recent evidence has provided new insights into the repercussions of glial environment modifications on the physiology of magnocellular neurosecretory cells at the synaptic level. These studies have revealed that the reduced astrocytic coverage of magnocellular neurons occurring in the SON affects various functions in which astrocytes play key roles. These functions include uptake of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, restricting diffusion of neuroactive substances within the extracellular space and release of informative molecules known as gliotransmitters that act on neighbouring neurons to modulate synaptic transmission and excitability. Overall, our observations indicate that the neuron-glial anatomical reorganization leads to modifications of glutamatergic transmission that might be important for the physiology of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system.

The electrical activity of MNCs, which is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic osmosensitive factors, is a primary determinant of blood AVP and OXT levels. Although we now understand many of the cellular mechanisms that mediate the osmotic control of electrical activity and secretion from MNCs, further insight is likely to emerge from a molecular analysis of these mechanisms. An important step towards this goal could be made through the use of mouse genetic models. However, the electrophysiological properties of MNCs in mice have not been characterized, making direct comparisons with the rat model somewhat difficult. In this study, we examined the electrical properties of MNCs from the mouse SON. Extracellular recordings from neurons in superfused explants revealed modes of basal and osmotically modulated firing very similar to those observed previously in rats. Recordings in hypothalamic slices confirmed that SON neurons receive kynurenic-acid-sensitive excitatory synaptic inputs from the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT). Current-clamp recordings from acutely dissociated SON neurons showed proportional changes in membrane cation conductance during changes in fluid osmolality. We conclude, therefore, that MNCs in the mouse SON display intrinsic osmosensitive properties and firing patterns that are very similar to those reported in the rat. Mouse MNCs therefore represent a useful model for the study of molecular factors contributing to the osmotic control of AVP and OXT release.

The characters are represented by histograms (empirical distributions) of features. The Kohonen network learning algorithm implements a gradient ascent which maximizes air entropy criterion under constraints. Using a database of handwritten online Arabic characters produced without constraints by a large number of writers, we conducted extensive experiments which show the advantage of this Cibbsian Kohonen network over other classifiers such as a, regular Kohonen neural network and a Cibbsian Bayes classifier.

Galactosyl ceramide has been previously shown to be involved in Pseudomonas internalization. Therefore, we assessed ceramide levels in the plasma of patients with CIF and compared them to healthy volunteers using high-performance liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that patients with CF display significantly lower levels of several ceramide sphingolipid species, specifically C14:0, C20:1, C22:0, C22:1, and C24:0 ceramides, and dihydroxy ceramide (DHC16:0). We report that Cftr-knockout mice display diminished ceramide levels in CF-related organs (lung, pancreas, ileum, and plasma) compared with their littermate controls. Since it has been previously reported that in vitro treatment with fenretinide induced ceramide in neuroblastoma cell lines, we decided to test this drug in vivo using our Cftr-knockout mice in an attempt to correct this newly identified defect in ceramide levels. We demonstrate that treatment with fenretinide is able to increase ceramide concentrations in CF-related organs. We further assessed the biological effect of fenretinide on the ability of Cftr-knockout mice to combat lung infection with P. aeruginosa. Our data show dramatic improvement in the ability of Cftr-knockout mice to control P. aeruginosa infection. Overall, these findings not only document a novel deficiency in several ceramide species in patients with CIF, but also demonstrate a pharmacologic means to correct this defect in Cftr-knockout mice. Our data provide a strong rationale for clinical intervention that may benefit patients with CIF suffering from CIF lung disease.

Our second objective was to examine whether this deletion attenuates expression of the SOD1 gene. Genomic DNA from more than 1200 SALS cases from Ireland, Scotland, Quebec and the USA was genotyped for the 50bp SOD1 promoter deletion. Reporter gene expression analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies were utilized to examine the functional effects of the deletion. The genetic association for homozygosity for the promoter deletion with an increased age of symptom onset was confirmed overall in this further study (p = 0.032), although it was only statistically significant in the Irish subset, and remained highly significant in the combined set of all cohorts (p = 0.001). Functional studies demonstrated that this polymorphism reduces the activity of the SOD1 promoter by approximately 50%. In addition we revealed that the transcription factor SP1 binds within the 50bp deletion region in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest the hypothesis that this deletion reduces expression of the SOD1 gene and that levels of the SOD1 protein may modify the phenotype of SALS within selected populations.

The central sulcus is also a landmark of utmost importance for neurosurgeons. Although the arteries supplying the central region have been briefly described, their exact course has not been studied. The aim of the study is to establish the position and course of the central sulcus artery in relation to the central sulcus and its convolutions. Methods: Computer-assisted three-dimensional (3-D) anatomical reconstructions of the central area and of the central sulcus artery were performed with the aid of neuronavigational software in 13 patients operated at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). Results: The central sulcus artery was coincident with the central sulcus and course(s) was almost similar on both hemispheres. Conclusions: The knowledge of the exact course of the central sulcus artery is of paramount importance in cases of lesions or epileptic foci involving the central area. 3-D reconstruction with neuronavigation has proven to be a reproducible and reliable technique to provide the surgeon with the necessary surgical topographic anatomy of the central sulcus artery and central area.

FTY720 modulates human oligodendrocyte progenitor process extension and survival	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							1-PHOSPHATE RECEPTOR AGONIST; SUBCORTICAL WHITE-MATTER; SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; PROCESS RETRACTION; COUPLED RECEPTORS; G-PROTEIN; CELLS	Objective: FTY720, a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier, is a potential immuno-therapy for multiple sclerosis. Our objective was to assess the effect of FTY720 on process extension, differentiation, and survival of human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and link the functional effects with SIP receptor expression and signaling. Methods: Functional assays and receptor expression studies were conducted on A2B5+ OPCs derived from the human fetal central nervous system. Cells were treated with physiologically relevant concentrations of the active phosphorylated form of FTY720. S1P receptor/signaling modulators were used to elucidate the basis of the FTY720-induced functional responses. Results: Short-term (1 day) FTY720 treatment caused initial process retraction that was reversed by uncoupling S1P3 and 5 from their G protein using suramin, and with a Rho-kinase inhibitor H1152. Retraction was associated with RhoA-mediated cytoskeletal signaling and with inhibition of OPC differentiation into more mature phenotypes. Continued FTY720 treatment (2 days) induced process extension and enhanced cell survival associated with increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylation, mimicked with the S1P1-specific agonist SEW2871, but not reversed with suramin. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that FTY720 induced reciprocal and cyclic modulation of S1P1 and S1P5 messenger RNA levels. The observed initial downregulation of S1P5 and subsequently of S1P1 messenger RNA supports functional responses being mediated sequentially by S1P5- and later S1P1-associated signaling. Interpretation: FTY720 induces time-dependent modulation of S1P receptors on human OPCs with consequent functional responses that are directly relevant for the remyelination process.

It is unknown whether heightened T-cell reactivities documented in adult patients, to both target-organ and environmental antigens, emerge in parallel or develop as early or late events. Our objectives were to determine the presence, pattern, and specificity of abnormal T-cell reactivities to such antigens in the earliest stages of the multiple sclerosis process. Methods: Peripheral T-cell proliferative responses to self-, dietary, and control antigens were blindly evaluated in a large cohort of well-characterized children (n = 172) with central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory demyelination (n = 63), recent-onset type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (T1D; n = 41), nonautoimmune neurological conditions (n = 39), and healthy children (n = 29). Results: Children with inflammatory demyelination, CNS injury, and T1D exhibited heightened T-cell reactivities to self-antigens, and these responses were not strictly limited to the disease target organs. Children with autoimmune disease and CNS injury also exhibited abnormal T-cell responses against multiple cow-milk proteins. Responses to specific milk epitopes distinguished T1D from inflammatory demyelination and other neurological diseases. Interpretation: Abnormal T-cell reactivities to self- and environmental antigens manifest in the earliest clinical stages of inflammatory demyelination and T1D. The pattern of heightened T-cell reactivities implicates both shared and distinct mechanisms of immune dysregulation in the different autoimmune diseases. Abnormal T-cell responses in children with tissue injury challenge the prevailing view that CNS autoreactive cells inherently mediate the disease in early multiple sclerosis.

These vestibular receptors consist of highly conserved semicircular canals and otolith organs. Unlike other senses, vestibular information in the central nervous system becomes immediately multisensory and multimodal. There is no overt, readily recognizable conscious sensation from these organs, yet vestibular signals contribute to a surprising range of brain functions, from the most automatic reflexes to spatial perception and motor coordination. Critical to these diverse, multimodal functions are multiple computationally intriguing levels of processing. For example, the need for multisensory integration necessitates vestibular representations in multiple reference frames. Proprioceptive-vestibular interactions, coupled with corollary discharge of a motor plan, allow the brain to distinguish actively generated from passive head movements. Finally, nonlinear interactions between otolith and canal signals allow the vestibular system to function as an inertial sensor and contribute critically to both navigation and spatial orientation.

Objective: To investigate whether the symptoms of depression reflect an ongoing pathophysiological change following concussion. Design: Cohort study with male athletes using functional and structural neuroimaging. Setting: Hospital laboratory and imaging facility. Participants: Fifty-six male athletes with and without concussion were divided into (1) a no depression symptom, concussed group, (2) a mild depression symptom, concussed group, (3) a moderate depression symptom, concussed group, and (4) a healthy control group. Interventions: All athletes filled out a postconcussive symptoms checklist and the Beck Depression Inventory II and underwent a magnetic resonance imaging session, which included T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), during which they performed a working memory task. Main Outcome Measures: (1) Behavioral: response speed and accuracy on the working memory task performed during the fMRI session; (2) functional imaging: brain activation patterns associated with the working memory task obtained using blood oxygen level dependent fMRI; and (3) structural imaging: voxel-based morphometry examining gray matter concentration. Results: (1) Behavioral: there was no performance difference between the groups; and (2) imaging: athletes with concussion with depression symptoms showed reduced activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum and attenuated deactivation in medial frontal and temporal regions. The severity of symptoms of depression correlated with neural responses in brain areas that are implicated in major depression. Voxel-based morphometry confirmed gray matter loss in these areas. Conclusions: The results suggest that depressed mood following a concussion may reflect an underlying pathophysiology consistent with a limbic-frontal model of depression. Given that depression is associated with considerable functional disability, this finding has important clinical implications for the management of individuals with a cerebral concussion.

In this paper, the performance of the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network for supervised incremental learning is compared to that of supervised batch learning. An experimental protocole is presented to assess this network's potential for incremental learning of new blocks of training data, in terms of generalization error and resource requirements, using several synthetic pattern recognition problems. The advantages and drawbacks of training fuzzy ARTMAP incrementally are assessed for different data block sizes and data set structures. Overall results indicate that error rate of fuzzy ARTMAP is significantly higher when it is trained through incremental learning than through batch learning. As the size of training blocs decreases, the error rate acheived through incremental learning grows, but provides a more compact network using fewer training epochs. In the cases where the class distributions overlap, incremental learning shows signs of over-training. With a growing numbers of training patterns, the error rate grows while the compression reaches a plateau.

However, patterns of neuropsychological impairments in organic and psychogenic amnesia can bear interesting resemblances despite different aetiologies. In this paper, two cases with profound, selective and permanent retrograde amnesia are presented, one of an apparent organic origin and the other with ail apparent psychogenic cause. The first case, DD, lost his memory after focal brain injury from a nail gun to the right temporal lobe. The second case, AC, lost her memory in the context of intense psychological suffering. In both cases, pre-morbid autobiographical memory for people, places and events was lost. and no feeling of familiarity was experienced during relearning. In addition, they both lost some semantic knowledge acquired prior to the onset of the amnesia. This contrasts with the preservation of complex motor skills without any awareness of having learned them. Both DD and AC showed mild deficits on memory tests but neither presented any anterograde amnesia. The paradox of these cases - opposite causes yet similar clinical profile - exemplifies the hypothesis that organic and psychogenic amnesia may be two expressions of the same faulty mechanism in the neural circuitry.

The PTM predicts that the tonus of visual representation ought to manifest hemispheric specialization in the occipital lobes. Specifically PTM predicts that pathological positive visual tones (visual hallucination) ought to be associated more frequently with right occipital lesions. PTM also predicts that pathological negative visual tonus (loss of visual imagery) ought to result more often from left occipital lesions. We reviewed 78 cases of post lesion hallucination and 12 cases of post lesion loss of evocation of images. all following a unilateral lesion. Analyses of these relevant previously published cases support the predictions. In accordance with previously published demonstrations of hemispheric specialization for auditory tonus in the temporal lobes and for somesthetic tonus in the parietal lobes, the present findings extend the psychic tones model of hemispheric specialization to vision in the occipital lobes.

Hippocampus 13, 334-340] while others emphasize a higher-level frontal lobe strategy that requires the flexible maintenance of information in working memory [Waltz, J., Knowlton, B., Holyoak, K., Boone, K., Mishkin, F., de Menedezes Santos, M., Thomas, C., Miller, B., 1999. A system for relational reasoning in human prefrontal cortex. Psychol. Sci. 10, 119-125]. In two experiments we investigated when and how adults employ different cognitive strategies during TI by evaluating the interaction between task instructions and individual differences in working memory capacity. Participants engaged in a paired discrimination task involving a 6-unit TI hierarchy and were either prior aware, prior unaware or serendipitously aware of the hierarchical relationship among stimulus items. Both prior aware participants and serendipitously aware participants were more likely to engage in a logic-based strategy compared to unaware participants who relied upon stimulus-driven strategies. Individual differences in working memory were associated with the acquisition of awareness in the serendipitously aware group and with the maintenance of awareness in the prior aware group. These findings suggest that the capacity for TI may be supported by multiple neurocognitive strategies, and that the specific strategy employed is dependent upon both task- and participant-related factors.

This model is capable of producing a range of important human EEG (electroencephalogram) features such as the alpha rhythm, the 40 Hz activity thought to be associated with conscious awareness (Bojak & Liley 2007) and the changes in EEG spectral power associated with general anesthetic effect (Bojak & Liley 2005). From the point of view of nonlinear dynamics, the model entails a vast parameter space within which multistability, pseudoperiodic regimes, various routes to chaos, fat fractals and rich bifurcation scenarios occur for physiologically relevant parameter values (van Veen & Liley 2006). The origin and the character of this complex behaviour, and its relevance for EEG activity will be illustrated. The existence of short-lived unstable brain states will also be discussed in terms of the available theoretical and experimental results.

Similar cognitive trends associated with similar lifestyles (sociality, generalism, new habitats) are seen in taxa that are phylogenetically distant and possess remarkably different brains. Many cognitive measures show positive intercorrelations at the inter-individual and inter-taxon level, suggesting some degree of general intelligence. Ecological principles like the unpredictability of resources in space and time may drive different types of cognition (e. g., social and non-social) in the same direction. Taxa that rank high on comparative counts of cognition in the field are usually the ones that succeed well in experimental tests, with the exception of avian imitation. From apes to birds, fish and beetles, a few common principles appear to have influenced the evolution of brains and cognition in widely divergent taxa. Copyright (c) 2008 S.

The purpose of this study was to explore the specific service needs of adolescents (12-18 years) after a mTBI. Study design: Qualitative phenomenological study. Methods and procedures: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 adolescents and their parents who had received different levels of care from paediatric trauma centres within the previous 12 months. Main outcomes and results: All adolescents and parents expressed the need to receive information about the injury, its expected recovery and when to return to activities. Many adolescents reported wanting to be seen rapidly, by professionals who genuinely care about them and who acknowledge that they have specific needs that differ from those of younger children. Parents and, to a lesser degree, adolescents think that enhanced communication between the healthcare and school systems would be beneficial following a mTBI to assist in returning to demanding academic activities. Conclusions: Professionals involved in the management of adolescents with mTBI should be aware of their needs in order to provide optimal and developmentally appropriate services.

Research design/methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to pattern-reversal, simple motion, texture segregation and cognitive oddball paradigms from 17 participants with symptomatic mTBI at onset of specialized clinical intervention and from 15 normal controls. The relationship between abnormal electrophysiology and post-intervention return to work status was also examined. Main outcomes and results: Participants with mTBI showed a statistically significant (p 0.05) amplitude reduction for cognitive ERPs and delayed latencies for texture (p 0.05) and cognitive paradigms (p 0.005) compared to controls. Furthermore, participants with mTBI presenting texture or cognitive ERP latency delays upon admission were at significantly (p 0.01) greater risk of negative vocational outcome than mTBI participants with normal electrophysiology. Conclusions: The findings suggest that individuals with symptomatic mTBI can present selective deficits in complex visual information processing that could interfere with vocational outcome. ERP paradigms such as those employed in this study thus show potential for evaluating outcome prognosis and merit further study.

Purpose: The objective of the study was to document the repercussions of TBI on victims' long-term social integration (10 years post-trauma) and the contribution made by the services received from the point of view of TBI victims and family caregivers. This article examines the determinants of long-term social integration as well as the impact of TBI on family caregivers. Methods: A qualitative design was used (semi-directed interviews). The sample consisted of 22 individuals who had sustained a moderate or severe TBI and 21 family caregivers. Results: The results show that TBI is an experience that continues to present difficulties, even 10 years after the accident, and that different barriers contribute to this difficulty: not going back to work, depressive episodes, problems in relationships and sequellae. Family caregivers must help TBI victims confront the barriers in their path. Implications: This study adopts a longitudinal perspective to help professionals determine how to intervene with TBI victims and their families. It validates the importance of having clients and family caregivers describe their reality.

Study design: Qualitative design including a focus group held with experts in the field of adolescent TBI and a validation survey of other professionals. Methods and procedures: Eight experts from a variety of disciplines participated in a focus group where important needs of adolescents were discussed. Results were then validated through a questionnaire to 33 professionals. Main outcomes and results: Experts questioned through both methods are generally in agreement and acknowledge that adolescents are unique, but they often find them challenging. Like adolescents themselves, experts identify the need for information as the most important but are wary of offering too much detail and fear that this could encourage malingering of symptoms and problems. Service providers also recognize the importance of supporting adolescents and parents when returning to activities (school and physical activities). Conclusions: The notion that teens represent a specific group of consumers of healthcare services is supported by findings in this study. These results provide important information to those involved in the structuring of service provision to adolescents following MTBI.

Research design: A prospective design was used to assess 18 children with mTBI and 18 matched healthy controls (8-16 years of age). Methods and procedures: Sensitivity to static and dynamic forms of simple (first-order) and complex (second-order) stimuli were assessed at 1, 4 and 12 weeks post-injury and at equivalent times for controls. Orientation and direction identification thresholds were measured for all participants for static and dynamic conditions, respectively. In addition, sensitivity to radial optic flow (inward vs outward), a complex motion stimulus, was assessed. Main outcomes and results: Thresholds measured from all complex stimuli were significantly affected for the mTBI children over time whereas no difference in threshold between groups across all testing conditions was found for simple, first-order information. Sensitivity to all complex stimuli was still affected 12 weeks after the injury. Conclusion: These findings suggest that injured children present selective processing deficits for higher-order information and that this deficit persists over relatively long periods. Such measures could be useful to assess children who have sustained mTBI and possibly contribute to identifying potential risks of returning these children to demanding physical activities.

The initiation of locomotion, on the other hand, relies on supraspinal networks and the cellular mechanisms involved are only beginning to be understood. This review examines some of the findings relative to the neural mechanisms involved in the initiation of locomotion of lampreys. Locomotion can be elicited by sensory stimulation or by internal cues associated with fundamental needs of the animal such as food seeking, exploration, and mating. We have described mechanisms by which escape swimming is elicited in lampreys in response to mechanical skin stimulation. A rather simple neural connectivity is involved, including sensory and relay neurons, as well as the brainstem rhombencephalic reticulospinal cells, which act as command neurons. We have shown that reticulospinal cells have intrinsic membrane properties that allow them to transform a short duration sensory input into a long-lasting excitatory command that activates the spinal locomotor networks. These mechanisms constitute an important feature for the activation of escape swimming. Other sensory inputs can also elicit locomotion in lampreys. For instance, we have recently shown that olfactory signals evoke sustained depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons and chemical activation of the olfactory bulbs with local injections of glutamate induces fictive locomotion. The mechanisms by which internal cues initiate locomotion are less understood. Our research has focused on one particular locomotor center in the brainstem, the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). The MLR is believed to channel inputs from many brain regions to generate goal-directed locomotion. It activates reticulospinal cells to elicit locomotor output in a graded fashion contrary to escape locomotor bouts, which are all-or-none. MLR inputs to reticulospinal cells use both glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission; nicotinic receptors on reticulospinal cells are involved. MLR excitatory inputs to reticulospinal cells in the middle (MRRN) are larger than those in the posterior rhombencephalic reticular nucleus (PRRN). Moreover at low stimulation strength, reticulospinal cells in the MRRN are activated first, whereas those in the PRRN require stronger stimulation strengths. The output from the MLR on one side activates reticulospinal neurons on both sides in a highly symmetrical fashion. This could account for the symmetrical bilateral locomotor output evoked during unilateral stimulation of the MLR in all animal species tested to date. Interestingly, muscarinic receptor activation reduces sensory inputs to reticulospinal neurons and, under natural conditions, the activation of MLR cholinergic neurons will likely reduce sensory inflow. Moreover, exposing the brainstem to muscarinic agonists generates sustained recurring depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons through pre-reticular effects. Cells in the caudal half of the rhombencephalon appear to be involved and we propose that the activation of these muscarinoceptive cells could provide additional excitation to reticulospinal cells when the MLR is activated under natural conditions. One important question relates to sources of inputs to the MLR. We found that substance P excites the MLR, whereas GABA inputs tonically maintain the MLR inhibited and removal of this inhibition initiates locomotion. Other locomotor centers exist such as a region in the ventral thalamus projecting direcly to reticulospinal cells. This region, referred to as the diencephalic locomotor region, receives inputs from several areas in the forebrain and is likely important for goal-directed locomotion. In summary, this review focuses on the most recent findings relative to initiation of lamprey locomotion in response to sensory and internal cues in lampreys. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To negotiate an obstacle successfully, subjects must first plan how to perform the movement and then must execute that plan. In cats, this information must also be stored and used to guide the hindlimbs, which are moved in the absence of direct visual input. Experiments in cats have shown that the motor cortex makes an important contribution to the execution of gait modifications and is involved both in specifying limb trajectory and, when necessary, where the paw will be placed. We suggest that, in both situations, subpopulations of pyramidal tract neurons in the motor cortex act to regulate the duration, level and timing of small groups of synergistic muscles, active at different times during the gait modification. However, the available evidence suggests that the motor cortex plays little role in the planning of these gait modifications. Instead, recent work suggests that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) may contribute to this function. In agreement with this proposal, we have found that lesions to this structure lead to errors in forelimb placement in front of an advancing obstacle and may produce deficits in forelimb-hindlimb coordination.

We provide a brief overview of spinal locomotion and describe the effects of various types of sensory deprivations (e.g. rhizotomies, and lesions of muscle and cutaneous nerves) to highlight the spinal neuroplasticity necessary for adapting to sensory loss. Recent work on plastic interactions between reflex pathways that could be responsible for such plasticity, in particular changes in proprioceptive and cutaneous pathways that occur during locomotor training of spinal cats, is discussed. Finally, we describe how stimulation of some sensory inputs via various limb manipulations or intraspinal electrical stimulation can affect the expression of spinal locomotion. We conclude that sensory inputs are critical not only for locomotion but also that changes in the efficacy of sensory transmission and in the interactions between sensory pathways could participate in the normalization of locomotion after spinal and/or peripheral lesions.

Method: A broad range of peer-reviewed manuscripts relevant to personality and depression was reviewed. Particular emphasis was placed on etiology, stability, diagnosis, and treatment implications. Results: Personality features in depressed samples reliably differ from those of healthy samples. The associations between personality and depression are consistent with a variety of causal models; these models can best be compared through longitudinal research. Research demonstrates that attention to personality features can be useful in diagnosis and treatment. Indeed, personality information has been on the forefront of recent efforts to advance the current diagnostic classification system. Moreover, personality dimensions have shown recent promise in the prediction of differential treatment outcome. For example, neuroticism is associated with preferential response to pharmacotherapy rather than psychotherapy. Conclusions: Consideration of personality features is crucial to the understanding and management of major depression.	[Bagby, R.

The system is based on analysis of the spectral content of radiofrequency ultrasonic echo data in combination with evaluations of textural, contextual, morphological and clinical features in a multiparameter approach. A state-of-the-art, non-linear classifier, the so-called adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, is used for higher-order classification of the underlying tissue-describing parameters. The system has been evaluated on radio-frequency ultrasound data originating from 100 patients using histological specimens obtained after prostatectomy as the gold standard. Leave-one-out cross-validation over patient data sets results in areas under the ROC curve of 0.86 +/- 0.01 for hypoechoic and hyperechoic tumors and of 0.84 +/- 0.02 for isoechoic tumors, respectively.

Methods: We reviewed the charts of patients admitted to the Montreal General Hospital between April 1, 2002 and October 15, 2005. Ischemic stroke was considered severe if the Canadian Neurological Scale at presentation was <= 7. Poor outcome at 10 days after onset was defined as a modified Rankin Scale > 3. Acute change in BP was defined as the percent difference between the mean 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the baseline MAP. AHT was considered present if administered 6 5 days during the first week after stroke onset. The association between predictors and outcome was assessed using unconditional multivariable logistic regression. Covariates used included age, stroke severity, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, premorbid hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Results: Three hundred and sixty-four patients were included. Compared to patients with intermediate baseline BP, those with a MAP 1 130 mm Hg [OR=2.47 (95% CI, 1.04-5.85)] or a MAP < 90 mm Hg [OR=2.94 ( 95% CI, 1.28 - 6.77)] were found to have an increased risk of poor outcome after covariate adjustment. A 15% increase in MAP was associated with an increased risk of poor outcome [OR=5.34 (95% CI, 1.18-24.3)] while AHT in the first week after stroke onset was found to result in a decreased risk [OR=0.39 ( 95% CI, 0.17-0.90)]. However, neither of these findings remained significant after adjustment for the described covariates. Conclusions: Both high and low MAP at presentation are associated with worse short-term outcome after ischemic stroke. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.	[Keezer, Mark R.; Yu, Amy Y.

Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in low-risk patients early after coronary artery bypass surgery	CIRCULATION			English	Article						cardiopulmonary bypass; coronary disease; inhibitors; trials; vasodilation	CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS; DISEASE; DYSFUNCTION; RAMIPRIL; OUTCOMES; THERAPY; GRAFTS; TRIALS	Background-Early after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), activation of numerous neurohumoral and endogenous vasodilator systems occurs that could be influenced favorably by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Methods and Results-The Ischemia Management with Accupril post -bypass Graft via Inhibition of the coNverting Enzyme (IMAGINE) trial tested whether early initiation (<= 7 days) of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor after CABG reduced cardiovascular events in stable patients with left ventricular ejection fraction >= 40%. The trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 2553 patients randomly assigned to quinapril, target dose 40 mg/d, or placebo, who were followed up to a maximum of 43 months. The mean (SD) age was 61 (10) years. The incidence of the primary composite end point (cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, unstable angina or heart failure requiring hospitalization, documented angina, and stroke) was 13.7% in the quinapril group and 12.2% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.42, P = 0.212) over a median follow-up of 2.95 years. The incidence of the primary composite end point increased significantly in the first 3 months after CABG in the quinapril group (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.26, P = 0.0356). Adverse events also increased in the quinapril group, particularly during the first 3 months after CABG. Conclusions-In patients at low risk of cardiovascular events after CABG, routine early initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy does not appear to improve clinical outcome up to 3 years after CABG; however, it increases the incidence of adverse events, particularly early after CABG. Thus, early after CABG, initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy should be individualized and continually reassessed over time according to risk.

Methods: We examined alpha and beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) to analyze brain reactivity during the selection of verbal (word production) and non-verbal motor actions (keyboard pressing) under two different response modes: externally selected and self-elected. Results: An alpha and beta ERD was observed for both the verbal and non-verbal tasks in both the externally and the self-selected modes. For both tasks, the beta ERD started earlier and was longer in the self-selected mode than in the externally selected mode. The overall pattern of results between the verbal and non-verbal motor behaviors was similar. Conclusions: The pattern of alpha and beta ERD is affected by the mode of response selection suggesting that the activity in both frequency bands contributes to the process of selecting actions. We suggest that activity in the alpha band may reflect attentional processes while activity in the beta band may be more closely related to the execution and selection process. Significance: These results suggest that a domain general process contributes to the planning of speech and other motor actions. This finding has potential clinical implications, for the use of diverse motor tasks to treat disorders of motor planning. (c) 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In addition to the environmental and genetic factors, early life conditions are now also considered important contributing elements to these pathologies. The concept of 'fetal' or 'developmental' origins of adult diseases has received increased recognition over the last decade, yet the mechanism by which altered perinatal environment can lead to dysfunction mostly apparent in the adult are incompletely understood. This review will focus on the mechanisms and pathways that epidemiological studies and experimental models have revealed underlying the adult cardiovascular phenotype dictated by the perinatal experience, as well as the probable key causal or triggering elements. Programmed elevated blood pressure in the adult human or animal is characterized by vascular dysfunction and microvascular rarefaction. Developmental mechanisms that have been more extensively studied include glucocorticoid exposure, the role of the kidneys and the renin-angiotensin system. Other pathophysiological pathways have been explored, such as the role of the brain and the sympathetic nervous system, oxidative stress and epigenetic changes. As with many complex diseases, a unifying hypothesis linking the perinatal environment to elevated blood pressure and vascular dysfunction in later life cannot be presumed, and a better understanding of those mechanisms is critical before clinical trials of preventive or 'deprogramming' measures can be designed.

This review focuses first on methotrexate, a drug often implicated in neurotoxicity, especially when used in combination with brain irradiation. The second focus is on glucocorticoids that have been found to be linked to adverse developmental effects in relation with the psychosocial environment. For both examples, we review how polymorphisms of genes encoding enzymes involved in specific mechanisms of action could moderate adverse neurodevelopmental consequences, eventually through common final pathways such as oxidative stress. We discuss a multiple hit model and possible strategies required to rise to the challenge of this integrative research. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2008,14:211-220.

Methods: Twenty-three 8-year-old children participated, five being born under 28 weeks gestational age (wGA) referred to as Preterms1 (mean = 8 years 5 months [SD 0.3]), nine Preterms2 of 28-35 wGA (mean = 7 years 9 months [SD 0.7]) and nine typically developing full-term controls (mean = 8 years 6 months [SD 0.7]). All children were studied in an interhemispheric transfer time and in a visuo-manual pointing-task to test motor programming time in three conditions: unimanual pointing (dominant, non-dominant hands), mirror bimanual pointing (same direction for both hands) and opposite bimanual pointing. Results: Significant differences were detected between Pre-terms 1 and 2, the latter being similar to controls. Preterms1 presented increases in interhemispheric time, suggesting an alteration in the transcallosal pathways. Programming time was significantly lengthened (p<0.01) for dominant hand unilateral pointing and opposite bilateral pointing and it was the shortest for mirror pointing. Conclusions: A faulty programming of visuo-manual tasks is suspected in Preterms1 with potential difficulty inhibiting the non-dominant limb mirror movement. This may result from an impaired interhemispheric inhibition owing to potential corpus callosum thinning. Such measures may be used to help follow-up subtle changes in fine motor control and detect pre-terms at risk of developing long-term deficits.

Pharmacological treatment of early multiple sclerosis	DRUGS			English	Review							CLINICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROMES; MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER RATIO; NORMAL-APPEARING WHITE; PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY; CERVICAL CORD PATHOLOGY; 1ST DEMYELINATING EVENT; FOLLOW-UP; INTERFERON BETA-1A; OPTIC NEURITIS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA	Currently, six medications are approved by the US FDA for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). In contrast, no pharmacological agent has proved to be effective in patients with secondary-progressive MS without relapses, or in patients with primary-progressive MS. One of the principal issues concerning an optimal pharmacotherapy for relapsing forms of MS is the optimal time of treatment initiation. There is now an almost universal consensus among MS experts that many patients will benefit from early therapy. However, several formidable challenges exist in identifying individuals who will benefit versus those who will do well without intervention. How do we define early MS and what clinical and paraclinical markers may be useful in defining the timing and nature of therapy? Do patients with a benign form of MS require therapy or are they exposed unnecessarily to adverse effects of our currently available medications? How do we identify disease progression and treatment failures? This review discusses these issues and outlines the evidence for application of 'early' treatment in patients with relapsing forms of MS.

Relationships between intertidal clam population and health status of the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria in the St. Lawrence Estuary and Saguenay Fjord (Quebec, Canada)	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Mya arenaria clams; biomarkers; population; toxic stress	CELLULAR-ENERGY ALLOCATION; PHAGOCYTIC-ACTIVITY; DAPHNIA-MAGNA; IN-VIVO; HEMOCYTES; RESPONSES; EXPOSURE; TEMPERATURE; BIOMARKER; BIVALVE	The purpose of this study was to examine the impacts of anthropogenic activity on the health status of intertidal clam populations of the Saguenay Fjord and the St. Lawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada). Clams were collected during low We at sites subject to direct contamination and at sites far from human activity. Clams were analyzed for tributyltin and dibutyltin total levels and toxic stress (glutathione S-transferase, gonadal lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks), immunocompetence (phagocytic activity, hemocyte count and viability), reproduction (gonado-somatic index, gamete maturation, and vitellogenin-like proteins), energy status (temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport, and gonad lipids), and individual status (age, condition factor, and growth index). These responses were compared against population characteristics such as live clam density, number of empty shells, and sex ratio. The results show that clam density decreased with distance from the estuary (high salinity level) to upstream of the fjord (low salinity). There was no clear relationship between the number of empty shells and distance or site quality. Clam density values corrected against distance were significantly correlated with hemocyte viability, phagocytic activity, mitochondrial electron transport (MET), DNA damage in gonad, and temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport activity. A canonical analysis of the various groups of biomarkers revealed that population metrics were more strongly related with immunocompetence, followed by energy status and temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport activity. However, toxic stress biomarkers were strongly associated with energy status and reproduction. This was further confirmed by non-linear modeling using adaptive artificial neural networks (genetic selection and back propagation learning paradigms), where the following parameters were able to predict population parameters with <20% error: gonad maturation and somatic index, MET (at 4 degrees C), gonad LPO, DNA damage, and phagocytic capacity. Intertidal clam populations were influenced by a distance gradient effect (salinity), where immunocompetence, in addition to energy status, was the strongest physiological parameter related to clam population metrics.

Two of the fundamental components of the epigenome are chromatin structure and covalent modification of the DNA molecule itself by methylation. DNA methylation patterns are sculpted during development and it has been a long held belief that they remain stable after birth in somatic tissues. Recent data suggest that DNA methylation is dynamic later in life in postmitotic cells such as neurons and thus potentially responsive to different environmental stimuli throughout life. We hypothesize a mechanism linking the social environment early in life and long-term epigenetic programming of behavior and responsiveness to stress and health status later in life. We will also discuss the prospect that the epigenetic equilibrium remains responsive throughout life and that therefore environmental triggers could play a role in generating interindividual differences in human behavior later in life. We speculate that exposures to different environmental toxins alters long-established epigenetic programs in the brain as well as other tissues leading to late-onset disease.

The possibility to combine EEG recording with functional MRI scanning (fMRI) opens the opportunity to uncover the regions of the brain showing changes in metabolism and blood flow in response to epileptic spikes seen in the EEG. These regions are presumably involved in the abnormal neuronal activity at the origin of epileptic discharges. This paper reviews the methodology involved in performing such studies, including the special techniques required for recording the EEG inside the scanner and the statistical issues in analyzing the fMRI signal. We then discuss the results obtained in patients with different types of focal epileptic disorders and in patients with primary generalized epilepsy. The results in general indicate that interictal epileptic discharges may affect brain areas well beyond the presumed region in which they are generated. The noninvasive nature of this method opens new horizons in the investigation of brain regions involved and affected by epileptic discharges.

This paper reviews how the understanding and surgical treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy developed, particularly from the work of Penfield, Jasper, and their associates at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). Methods: Publications on EEG and surgery for temporal lobe seizures from 1935 to 1953 were reviewed and charts of selected patients operated on at the MNI in the same period were examined. Attention was focused on the evolution of surgical techniques for temporal lobe epilepsy. Results: In the late 1930s, some EEG findings suggested deep-lying disturbances originating in the temporal lobe. However, it took another two decades before the correlation of clinical, neurophysiological, and anatomical findings provided evidence for the involvement of the mesial structures in psychomotor or temporal lobe seizures. From 1949 and onward, Penfield and his associates applied this evidence to extend the surgical resections to include the uncus and the hippocampus. Conclusion: The collaborative work of a team led by Penfield and Jasper at the MNI helped to define the role of neurophysiological studies in epilepsy surgery. As a result, the importance of removing the mesial structures in order to obtain better seizure control in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy became firmly established.

It is important to find the appropriate level to study the particular aspect of memory under investigation. In this review, I will focus on insights gained from examining memory at the molecular level. I will illustrate these insights with specific examples from examining the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying long-term facilitation in the marine mollusk Aplysia and long-term potentiation, studied mainly in rodents. In particular, I will discuss how molecular memory traces are formed and focus in detail on what role increasing the level of proteins through protein synthesis and gene expression plays in memory formation. I will point out three important constraints from molecular work that should impact on cognitive modeling of the nervous system: (i) the induction of plasticity depends on the 'state' of the synapse; (ii) there are multiple independent molecular traces formed after experience with different half-lives; and (iii) the requirement for the conjunction of synaptic activation and new protein synthesis implies that new conjunctions are required to induce long-term memory formation.

In neurons, several mRNAs are localized in dendrites and their presence allows autonomous control of local translation in response to stimulation of specific synapses. Active constitutive and activity-induced mechanisms of mRNA transport have been described that represent critical steps in the establishment and maintenance of synaptic plasticity. In recent years, the molecular composition of different transporting units has been reported and the identification of proteins and mRNAs in these RNA granules contributes to our understanding of the key steps that regulate mRNA transport and translation. Although RNA granules are heterogeneous, several proteins are common to different RNA granule populations, suggesting that they play important roles in the formation of the granules and/or their regulation during transport and translation. About 1-4% of the neuron transcriptome is found in RNA granules and the characterization of bound mRNAs reveal that they encode proteins of the cytoskeleton, the translation machinery, vesicle trafficking, and/or proteins involved in synaptic plasticity. Non-coding RNAs and microRNAs are also found in dendrites and likely regulate RNA translation. These mechanisms of mRNA transport and local translation are critical for synaptic plasticity mediated by activity or experience and memory.

We will also stress the importance of criteria that have to be fulfilled in order to unravel the cellular mechanisms of memory: detectability, mimicry, anterograde alteration and retrograde alteration. We will also propose that a large number of animal models should be used to explore the great variety of potential mechanisms that may exist to explain behaviours and their modifications and in particular memory. Finally using the experimental model of Aplysia as example we will insist that to explain the total reflex in an intact animal, all the neurons sensory neurons and different layers of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons - have to be investigated.

The disruption of semantic memory as a result of brain damage may have profound negative consequences on an individual's ability to name objects and process concepts. This can be disrupted as a result of many forms of brain damage, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current paper reviews research demonstrating that semantics deteriorates early in AD, particularly on effortful semantic tasks. There is a "category effect", meaning that AD preferentially affects concepts dealing with living things and abstract concepts compared to non-living objects and verbs/actions. While this pattern of deterioration, specific for AD, may reflect a breakdown within a distributed semantic system (where living things are distinguished by a high rate of inter-correlations between concepts or by a particular mode of being learned), it is equally possible that there is a regional distribution of semantic knowledge, with living things preferentially involving left temporal regions which become damaged early on in AD. Evidence from patients with strokes and semantic dementia, as well as activation studies in normal individuals, implicates the left posterior temporal region in semantic processing for pictures, abstract words, and concrete words. AD individuals, who are impaired in a variety of semantic tasks, show functional deficits in this area, and fail to activate it normally.

The evidence suggests that a significant proportion of patients show POCD in the early weeks following surgery and anesthesia. Specific domains of cognition are affected, especially memory. Much less evidence supports the presence of POCD several months or years after surgery, suggesting that POCD may be transient. However, several methodological issues make it difficult to compare findings across studies. Increasing age is among the most consistently reported patient-related risk factor. Other factors more directly related to the surgery and anesthesia are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of POCD, including inflammatory processes triggered by the surgical procedure. Animal studies have provided valuable findings otherwise not possible in human studies; these include a correlation between the inflammatory response in the hippocampus and the development of POCD in rodents.

Multimodality inferring of human cognitive states based on integration of neuro-fuzzy network and information fusion techniques	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							MULTICRITERIA DECISION-MAKING; DRIVER FATIGUE; WAVELET TRANSFORMS; AGGREGATION; ENVIRONMENT; WEIGHTS; SYSTEM	To achieve an effective and safe operation on the machine system where the human interacts with the machine mutually, there is a need for the machine to understand the human state, especially cognitive state, when the human's operation task demands an intensive cognitive activity. Due to a well-known fact with the human being, a highly uncertain cognitive state and behavior as well as expressions or cues, the recent trend to infer the human state is to consider multimodality features of the human operator. In this paper, we present a method for multimodality inferring of human cognitive states by integrating neuro-fuzzy network and information fusion techniques. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we take the driver fatigue detection as an example. The proposed method has, in particular, the following new features. First, human expressions are classified into four categories: (i) casual or contextual feature, (ii) contact feature, (iii) contactless feature, and (iv) performance feature. Second, the fuzzy neural network technique, in particular Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) model, is employed to cope with uncertain behaviors. Third, the sensor fusion technique, in particular ordered weighted aggregation (OWA), is integrated with the TSK model in such a way that cues are taken as inputs to the TSK model, and then the outputs of the TSK are fused by the OWA which gives outputs corresponding to particular cognitive states under interest (e. g., fatigue). We call this method TSK-OWA. Validation of the TSK-OWA, performed in the Northeastern University vehicle drive simulator, has shown that the proposed method is promising to be a general tool for human cognitive state inferring and a special tool for the driver fatigue detection.

J	Roy, K; Bhattacharya, P				Roy, Kaushik; Bhattacharya, Prabir			Optimal Features Subset Selection and Classification for Iris Recognition	EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article							WAVELET TRANSFORM; TEXTURE ANALYSIS; VECTOR; SYSTEM; IMAGES; REPRESENTATION; MACHINE; PATTERN; FILTER	The selection of the optimal features subset and the classification have become an important issue in the field of iris recognition. We propose a feature selection scheme based on the multiobjectives genetic algorithm (MOGA) to improve the recognition accuracy and asymmetrical support vector machine for the classification of iris patterns. We also suggest a segmentation scheme based on the collarette area localization. The deterministic feature sequence is extracted from the iris images using the 1D log-Gabor wavelet technique, and the extracted feature sequence is used to train the support vector machine (SVM). The MOGA is applied to optimize the features sequence and to increase the overall performance based on the matching accuracy of the SVM. The parameters of SVM are optimized to improve the overall generalization performance, and the traditional SVM is modified to an asymmetrical SVM to treat the false accept and false reject cases differently and to handle the unbalanced data of a specific class with respect to the other classes. Our experimental results indicate that the performance of SVM as a classifier is better than the performance of the classifiers based on the feedforward neural network, the k-nearest neighbor, and the Hamming and the Mahalanobis distances. The proposed technique is computationally effective with recognition rates of 99.81% and 96.43% on CASIA and ICE datasets, respectively. Copyright (C) 2008 K. Roy and P. Bhattacharya.

Its molecular basis is largely unknown. Recently, a combined disorder of N- and O-linked glycosylation was described in children with congenital cutis laxa in association with severe central nervous system involvement, brain migration defects, seizures and hearing loss. We report on seven additional patients with similar clinical features in combination with congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIx. On the basis of phenotype in 10 patients, we define an autosomal recessive cutis laxa syndrome. The patients have a complex phenotype of neonatal cutis laxa, transient feeding intolerance, late closure of the fontanel, characteristic facial features including down-slanting palpebral fissures, short nose and small mouth, and developmental delay. There is a variable degree of the central nervous system involvement and variable systemic presentation. The biochemical analysis using transferrin isoelectric focusing gives false negative results in some of the youngest patients. Analysis of the apolipoprotein C-III isoelectric focusing, however, is diagnostic in all cases.	[Morava, E.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Lefeber, D.

University varsity athletes (n=170) who had sustained at least one concussion over the previous 12 months from six sports completed both the Sport History Questionnaire (Delaney, Lacroix, Leclerc, & Johnston, 2000), used to measure concussions, and the Attributional Style Questionnaire (Peterson et al., 1982), used to measure explanatory style. Overall, males sustained more concussions than female athletes (F-1,F-153=43.92, P<0.05). Regarding the type of concussion, male athletes sustained more unrecognized concussions than female athletes (F-1,F-168=6.18, P<0.05), but there was no difference between the sexes for recognized concussions (F-1,F-168=0.44, P>0.05). Male basketball players took longer to recover (mean=6.17 days) than female basketball players (mean=1.15 days). In contrast, female hockey players took longer to recover (mean=9.56 days) than male hockey players (mean=1.00 day). Finally, gender did not influence an athlete's explanatory style.

Mildly seasonal healthy young women without a personal or family history of psychiatric disorders remained in either dim or bright light during two test days. Tryptophan-deficient and nutritionally balanced amino acid mixtures were administered in counterbalanced order. Mood state was assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). In dim light, ATD decreased POMS scores across most subscales, indicating a worsening of mood. In bright light, mood was unaffected by ATD. Thus, bright tight blocked the worsening of mood caused by ATD. This was also observed on the positive mood VAS. These results indicate a direct, immediate interaction between bright tight and serotonin function. Bright light might help protect against ATD-induced mood change by increasing serotonin above the threshold level below which there is a lowering of mood. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in a subject with a neuronopathy who specifically lacks A-beta afferents indicated that tactile C afferents (CT) activate insular cortex, whereas no response was seen in somatosensory areas 1 and 2. Psychophysical tests suggested that CT afferents give rise to an inconsistent perception of weak and pleasant touch. By examining two neuronopathy subjects as well as control subjects we have now demonstrated that CT stimulation can elicit a sympathetic skin response. Further, the neuronopathy subjects' ability to localize stimuli which activate CT afferents was very poor but above chance level. The findings support the interpretation that the CT system is well suited to underpin affective rather than discriminative functions of tactile sensations.

Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) that lead to increased production of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) are associated with the early-onset, familial forms of AD. However, in addition to ageing, the most common risk factors for the sporadic, prevalent form of AD are hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, ischaemic stroke, the ApoE4 allele and diabetes, all characterized by a vascular pathology. In AD, the vascular pathology includes accumulation of A beta in the vessel wall, vascular fibrosis, and other ultrastructural changes in constituent endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Moreover, the ensuing chronic cerebral hypoperfusion has been proposed as a determinant factor in the accompanying cognitive deficits. In transgenic mice that overexpress mutated forms of the human APP (APP mice), the increased production of A beta results in vascular oxidative stress and loss of vasodilatory function. The culprit molecule, superoxide, triggers the synthesis of other reactive oxygen species and the sequestration of nitric oxide (NO), thus impairing resting cerebrovascular tone and NO-dependent dilatations. The A beta-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction can be completely abrogated in aged APP mice with antioxidant therapy. In contrast, in mice that overproduce an active form of the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta 1 and recapitulate the vascular structural changes seen in AD, antioxidants have no beneficial effect on the accompanying cerebrovascular deficits. This review discusses the beneficial role and limitations of antioxidant therapy in AD cerebrovascular pathology.

BNP in the plasma strikingly increases in left ventricular dysfunction from several causes. Objective: To evaluate hBNP assays in diagnostic, prognostic and guiding treatment strategies in heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases, and to assess the clinical use of recombinant hBNP. Methods: Analysis of hBNP and NT-proBNP as suitable markers for clinical use and application of hBNP in management of acute decompensated heart failure. Results/conclusion: hBNP assays provide useful information for the diagnosis of various heart pathologies, particularly when used with other clinical tests such as echocardiography. They also provide prognostic values for future cardiovascular events. However, use of recombinant BNP for managing acute decompensated heart failure should be limited because it has been associated with both renal dysfunction and increased risk of mortality.

(2001) Ann Neurol50, 202-207]. The subject had inherited two mutated genes for beta-enolase. These mutations changed glycine 156 to aspartate and glycine 374 to glutamate. In order to study the effects of these changes on the structure and stability of enolase, we have introduced the corresponding changes (G157D and G376E) into yeast enolase. The two variants are correctly folded. They are less stable than wild-type enolase with respect to thermal denaturation, and both have increased K-d values for subunit dissociation. At 37 degrees C, in the presence of salt, both are partially dissociated and are extensively cleaved by trypsin. Under the same conditions, wild-type enolase is fully dimeric and is only slightly cleaved by trypsin. However, wild-type enolase is also extensively cleaved if it is partially dissociated. The identification of the cleavage sites and spectral studies of enolase have revealed some of the structural differences between the dimeric and monomeric forms of this enzyme.

Energy and resource saving measures were extracted from existing high performance buildings practices through a subjective survey among building professionals, which provided guidelines for further optimization work on adapting building parameters and components. The two reference buildings were conceived to meet the requirements of the Canadian Model National Energy Code for Buildings. The path taken for optimization divided the problem into three phases. First, TRNSYS models were developed to predict the energy performance of the two buildings, and the simulation outputs were compared to the results in literature for accuracy confirmation. Then, building characteristics and components were varied in the TRNSYS models to build a database, for training and testing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for Response Surface Approximations (RSA). Finally, the ANN model was invoked inside Genetic Algorithm loops, in an attempt to search for the best combination of building parameters that could reduce the energy consumption of the target buildings to the most. The final optimization results demonstrated that up to 39% energy saving could be achieved in both buildings by upgrading the building envelop, enhancing the ventilation regulation, reducing lighting power density, and improving the efficiency of electrical appliance and HVAC systems.

Under particular circumstances, some stem cell populations can undergo prolonged cell cycle arrest or quiescence, until they are triggered to divide by a given stimulus. In cancer treatment, these populations represent a significant roadblock to efficient therapies as their non-dividing state renders them refractory to most commonly used cytotoxic interventions. In certain organisms, germline stem cells undergo quiescence if animals experience inappropriate growth conditions, and recent studies have determined that the level of insulin signaling is key in the regulation of their proliferation rate, and that it functions through at least two tumor suppressor genes, PTEN and LKB1. These gene products regulate both growth and polarity in diverse cellular contexts, while it remains unclear how they can modulate cell division and prevent tumorigenesis through each of these functions, and whether indeed these functions are separable. We hope that understanding how these tumor suppressor genes impinge on quiescent stem cell populations could provide us with a means of designing more effective therapies to reduce the frequency of stem cell-derived tumor growth that occurs following treatment.

Brain aging modulates the neuroprotective effects of estrogen on selective aspects of cognition in women: A critical review	FRONTIERS IN NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						estrogen; cognitive functioning; postmenopausal women; brain aging; progestins	HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY; FEMALE RHESUS-MONKEYS; SURGICALLY MENOPAUSAL WOMEN; CONGENITAL ADRENAL-HYPERPLASIA; CONJUGATED EQUINE ESTROGENS; HEALTH INITIATIVE MEMORY; DENDRITIC SPINE DENSITY; RADIAL-ARM MAZE; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL	Although there is now a substantial literature on the putative neuroprotective effects of estrogen on cognitive functioning in postmenopausal women, it is replete with inconsistencies. The critical period hypothesis, posited several years ago, attempts to account for the discrepancies in this literature by positing that estrogen treatment (ET) will protect aspects of cognition in older women only when treatment is initiated soon after the menopause. Indeed, evidence from basic neuroscience and from the animal and human literature reviewed herein provides compelling support for the critical period hypothesis. Although it is not known with certainty why estrogen does not protect cognition and may even cause harm when administered to women over the age of 65 years, it is likely that the events that characterize brain aging, such as a reduction in brain volume and in neuronal size, alterations in neurotransmitter systems, and a decrease in dendritic spine numbers, form an unfavorable background that precludes a neuroprotective effects of exogenous estrogen on the brain. Other factors that have likely contributed to the discrepancies in the estrogen-cognition literature include differences in the estrogen compounds used, their route of administration, cyclic versus continuous regimens, and the concomitant use of progestins. This critical analysis attempts to define conditions under which ET may protect aspects of cognition in aging women while also considering the cost/benefit ratio for the treatment of women aged 50-59 years. Suggestions for specific future research questions are also addressed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The mechanisms by which retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die in glaucoma are becoming better understood, but are still poorly defined. Elucidating the pathways that connect risk factors for glaucoma (e.g., elevated intraocular pressure) and RGC death is difficult in patients because of ethical and practical constraints. Even in experimental animals, single-cell observations and cell-cell interactions can be tricky to tease apart. For these reasons, it is helpful to use cell and tissue culture models for studying RGCs and other cellular constituents of the optic nerve. This chapter describes the advantages and disadvantages of several commonly used methods for preparing and studying these cultures, including those most relevant to glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

Its activity is regulated by an unusual iron-sulfur cluster (ICS) switch. Thus, in iron-replete cells, IRP1 assembles a cubane [4Fe-4S] cluster that prevents RNA-binding activity and renders the protein to cytosolic aconitase. We show that wild type or mutant forms of IRP1 that fail to assemble, a [4Fe-4S] cluster are sensitized for iron-dependent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The regulation of IRP1 abundance poses an alternative mechanism to prevent accumulation of inappropriately high IRE-binding activity when the ICS assembly pathway is impaired. To study functional aspects of IRP1, we overexpressed wild type or mutant forms of the protein in human H1299 lung cancer cells in a tetracycline-inducible fashion, and analyzed how this affects cell growth. While the induction of IRP1 did not affect cell proliferation in culture, it dramatically reduced the capacity of the cells to form solid tumor xenografts in nude mice. These data provide a first link between IRP1 and cancer.

The former process accesses a cognitive map representing the spatial interactions between all paths in the environment. The latter accesses stored associations between landmark objects and their milieu. Here, we aimed at dissociating their neural basis in the context of memory-based virtual navigation. To do so, subjects freely explored a virtual town for 1 h, then were scanned using fMRI while retrieving their way between two locations, under four navigation conditions designed to probe separately or jointly the spatial and contextual memory components. Besides prominent commonalities found in a large hippocampo-neocortical network classically involved in topographical navigation, results yield evidence for a partial dissociation between the brain areas supporting spatial and contextual components of memory-based navigation. Performance-related analyses indicate that hippocampal activity mostly supports the spatial component, whereas parahippocampal activity primarily supports the contextual component. Additionally, the recruitment of contextual memory during navigation was associated with higher frontal, posterior parietal and lateral temporal activity. These results provide evidence for a partial segregation of the neural substrates of two crucial memory components in human navigation, whose combined involvement eventually leads to efficient navigation behavior within a learned environment.

This is behaviorally well documented in studies on memory for prose, in which the meaning of novel sentences is typically well remembered but information pertaining to exact wording and syntax is not. The neural basis of this 'verbatim effect' is poorly understood. In the current fMRI study, we manipulated the novelty of sentences at different levels to test whether medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions that are known to play a critical role in verbal episodic encoding would respond preferentially to the novelty of sentence meaning. Fifteen participants were pre-familiarized with auditory sentences describing unique episodes. During scanning, they encountered sentences that were old, that contained a change in (i.e., were novel in terms of) syntactic relationship, that contained a change semantic relationships, or that described an entirely novel episode. Subsequently, participants performed a recognition memory test for the different types of novel information encountered. Behavioral data confirmed the typical verbatim effect. Analyses of fMRI data revealed differential MTL activation in the left hippocampus and entorhinal cortex with a response profile across conditions that paralleled the behavioral results; the identified region responded selectively to those conditions that contained semantic novelty. Other regions, by contrast, showed a novelty response that did not share this selectivity. Our findings suggest that the verbatim effect can be linked to hippocampally-based novelty-assessment processes that operate based on semantic relationships. (C)2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

As the number of childhood cancer survivors grows, so too does the need for evidence-based surveillance of the long-term effects of cancer therapy. Long-term effects involving the endocrine system represent a frequent complication of therapy. The Children's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers (COG LTFUG), most recently updated in 2006, provide a summary of the known endocrine late effects of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and stem cell transplant. This paper summarizes the scope and nature of the endocrine late effects of childhood cancer therapy based upon a review of the pertinent medical literature, and demonstrates how pediatric oncologists can use these guidelines in clinical practice.

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema	HYPERTENSION			English	Article						angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; angioneurotic edema; antigens; CD26; substance P; neuropeptides; bradykinin	SUBSTANCE-P; PLASMA EXTRAVASATION; AMINOPEPTIDASE-P; BRADYKININ; EDEMA; EFFICACY; THERAPY; VILDAGLIPTIN; METABOLISM; SERUM	Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Bradykinin and substance P, substrates of angiotensin-converting enzyme, increase vascular permeability and cause tissue edema in animals. Studies indicate that amino-terminal degradation of these peptides, by aminopeptidase P and dipeptidyl peptidase IV, may be impaired in individuals with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema. This case-control study tested the hypothesis that dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity and antigen are decreased in sera of patients with a history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema. Fifty subjects with a history of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema and 176 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-exposed control subjects were ascertained. Sera were assayed for angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, aminopeptidase P activity, aminopeptidase N activity, dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity, and antigen and the ex vivo degradation half-lives of bradykinin, des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, and substance P in a subset. The prevalence of smoking was increased and of diabetes decreased in case versus control subjects. Overall, dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity (26.6 +/- 7.8 versus 29.6 +/- 7.3 nmol/mL per minute; P = 0.026) and antigen (465.8 +/- 260.8 versus 563.1 +/- 208.6 ng/mL; P = 0.017) were decreased in sera from individuals with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-exposed control subjects without angioedema. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity (21.5 +/- 4.9 versus 29.8 +/- 6.7 nmol/ mL per minute; P = 0.001) and antigen (354.4 +/- 124.7 versus 559.8 +/- 163.2 ng/mL; P = 0.003) were decreased in sera from cases collected during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition but not in the absence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The degradation half-life of substance P correlated inversely with dipeptidyl peptidase IV antigen during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Environmental or genetic factors that reduce dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity may predispose individuals to angioedema.

Integrated Time Motion Image (ITMI) is a type of spatio-temporal database that includes motion and time of motion occurrence. Applying eigenspace technique to ITMIs leads in extracting eigen-motion and finally MLP Neural Network is used for precise classification of motions and determination of a fall event. Unlike existent fall detection systems only deal with limited movement patterns, we considered wide range of motions consisting normal daily life activities, abnormal behaviors and also unusual events. Reliable recognition rate of experimental results underlines satisfactory performance of our system.

For information Extraction tasks, we led an experimentation in which we exposed a group of 17 learners to a series of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Decision tree classifier has demonstrated the best ability to learn model structure from data collected. Among the emotions involved in learning and according to the picture from IAPS and the current emotional state, we drew up the transition diagram. Our model aims to improve the task of predicting the emotional state in an Intelligent Tutoring System and achieve a prediction accuracy of 63.11 %. These results suggest that the implementation of the decision tree algorithm in the intelligent tutoring system we are developing improves the ability for an ITS to track the learners emotional states.

Associated with attentional networks, at least 3 brain modules govern control processes by drawing on disparate functional neuroanatomy, neuromodulators, and psychological substrates. Guided by data-driven brain theories, researchers have related specific genetic polymorphisms to well-defined phenotypes, including those associated with different attentional efficiencies and hypnosis. Because attention can modulate both cognitive and affective processes, genetic assays together with neuroimaging data have begun to elucidate individual differences. Findings from genetic assays of both attention and hypnotizability pave the way to answering questions such as how high hypnotizable individuals may differ from less-hypnotizable persons. These exploratory findings may extend to the identification of placebo responders.

Electrical stimulation of the PVN increased pain threshold, and microinjection of L-glutamate sodium into the PVN also elevated pain threshold in a dose-dependent manner, whereas cauterization of the PVN decreased pain threshold. Stimulation or cauterization of the area located within 1.0 mm of the outer perimeter of the PVN did not change pain threshold. Pituitary removal could not influence the effect of L-glutamate sodium microinjection into PVN-induced pain threshold increase. The data suggest that PVN plays a role in antinociception through the central nervous system rather than peripheral organs.

Several different adaptation scenarios are investigated to determine the effects of mismatched speaker characteristics and mismatched task domain on the ability to verify the phoneme level pronunciations. These techniques are evaluated in the context of a speech corpus where utterances were elicited from children in interactive speech therapy sessions involving a multimodal game-like environment. Results are presented in terms of phone detection charateristics where, for example, equal error rates of as low as 16.2% were obtained for detecting instances where phonemes were deleted by impaired speakers.

Effect of time-of-day on neuromuscular properties of knee extensors after a short exhaustive cycling exercise	ISOKINETICS AND EXERCISE SCIENCE			English	Article						diurnal variation; muscle fatigue; electromyography; limited time; MVC	CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; SPORTS PERFORMANCE; QUADRICEPS; MUSCLE; CONTRACTILE; ENDURANCE; FATIGUE; TORQUE; POWER	We investigated the effect on neuromuscular properties of the knee extensors of an exhaustive cycling exercise performed at 6AM and 6PM. Eleven well trained cyclists performed a maximal aerobic exercise consisting in a sustained effort at 95% of their maximal power until exhaustion ( T-lim). Isometric maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC) and electromyographic activities ( root mean square: RMS) of the vastus lateralis were recorded before ( pre-test) and immediately after ( post-test) the cycling exercise. The MVC/RMS ratio was calculated and used as an index of neuromuscular efficiency ( NME). Rectal temperature was recorded continuously throughout the test session. Results show that Tlim cycling exercise was not time-of-day dependent ( p = 0.42). A significant interaction effect of time of day and the cycling exercise was demonstrated for MVC ( p < 0.02) and NME ( p < 0.05). In pre-test, MVC and NME were higher in the late afternoon than in the morning (+ 6.8%); however both parameters were more affected by the Tlim exercise at 6PM than at 6AM. These results suggest that following cycling Tlim exercise, neuromuscular properties of the knee extensors are more affected in the evening than in the morning. However, circadian rhythm of some biomechanical parameters implicated in the pedalling movement may modulate the effect of these diurnal variations.

The present study tested the hypothesis that impaired scar healing in post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) rats was associated with a reduction of sympathetic fibers innervating the infarct region. In 1-wk post-MI rats, neurofilament-M-immunoreactive fibers (1,116 +/- 250 mu m(2)/mm(2)) were detected innervating the infarct region and observed in close proximity to a modest number of endothelial nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive scar-residing vessels. Dexamethasone (Dex) treatment (6 days) of post-MI rats led to a significant reduction of scar weight (Dex + MI 38 +/- 4 mg vs. MI 63 +/- 2 mg) and a disproportionate nonsignificant decrease of scar surface area (Dex + MI 0.54 +/- 0.06 cm(2) vs. MI 0.68 +/- 0.06 cm(2)). In Dex-treated post-MI rats, the density of neurofilament-M-immunoreactive fibers (125 +/- 47 mu m(2)/mm(2)) innervating the infarct region was significantly reduced and associated with a decreased expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA (Dex + MI 0.80 +/- 0.07 vs. MI 1.11 +/- 0.08; P < 0.05 vs. MI). Previous studies have demonstrated that scar myofibroblasts synthesize NGF and may represent a cellular target of Dex. The exposure of 1st passage scar myofibroblasts to Dex led to a dose-dependent suppression of [H-3] thymidine uptake and a concomitant attenuation of NGF mRNA expression (untreated 3.47 +/- 0.35 vs. Dex treated 2.28 +/- 0.40; P < 0.05 vs. untreated). Thus the present study has demonstrated that impaired scar healing in Dex-treated post-MI rats was associated with a reduction of neurofilament-M-immunoreactive fibers innervating the infarct region. The attenuation of scar myofibroblast proliferation and NGF mRNA expression may represent underlying mechanisms contributing to the diminished neural response in the infarct region of Dex-treated post-MI rats.

It thus constitutes a primary target for investigation of early markers of AD. Language deficits occur early in AD, and performance on verbal tasks is an important diagnostic criterion for both AD and MCI. We review language performance in MCI, compare these findings to those seen in AD, and identify the primary issues in understanding language performance in MCI and selecting tasks with diagnostic and prognostic value.

Materials and Methods: Measures of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were compared in the brains of 13 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and a group of 13 aged-matched control participants employing an optimized DTI technique involving a fully automated, voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analysis. Results: After rigorous control for anatomical variation and confounding partial volume effects, we found significantly elevated MD measures within the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial temporal, parietal, and frontal lobe gray matter regions in the AD participants. The largest number of pixels with increased MD was localized bilaterally, within the posterior cingulate gyrus. The FA was significantly reduced within the thalamus, parietal white matter, and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, indicating significant involvement of corticothalamic and thalamocortical radiations. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that rigorous VBM analysis of DTI data can be used to investigate microstructural changes in cortical, subcortical, and white matter regions in AD.

The purpose of this study was to describe the range of treatment regimens used to treat pediatric SPNET in Canada and to identify prognostic factors for overall survival in this population. Methods This study was a retrospective clinical analysis of SPNET patients treated over the last 10 years in Canada. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to all institutions in Canada who treat pediatric patients. Data were collected for patients < 19 years of age who were diagnosed and treated for SPNET between 1995 and 2005. Results Data were obtained for 48 eligible patients. The stages of patients for whom complete data were provided were 80, 3, and 16% for metastatic stage M0, M1, and M2/3, respectively. The best responses to therapy included complete response in 44%, partial response in 8%, still on therapy in 2%, progressive disease in 31%, toxic death in 2%, and no therapy given in 12%. The 4-year survival was 37.7 +/- 7.6%. The factors associated with an increase in survival were the use of radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and age > 2 years. Overall survival was not affected by metastatic disease at diagnosis, tumor site, or degree of initial resection. Conclusions Survival is poor in SPNET patients but highest in those who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Further studies are needed to improve the survival of these patients.

Group I mGluR5 metabotropic glutamate receptors regulate proliferation of neuronal progenitors in specific forebrain developmental domains	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Review						BrdU; cerebral cortex; neurogenesis; neurotransmitter; stereology; striatum	LATERAL GANGLIONIC EMINENCE; IMMUNOREACTIVE GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; PRECURSOR CELL-PROLIFERATION; NEOCORTICAL VENTRICULAR ZONE; DEVELOPING CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CEREBELLAR GRANULE CELLS; RAT BASAL GANGLIA; III BETA-TUBULIN; NMDA RECEPTORS; MAMMALIAN TELENCEPHALON	Major classical neurotransmitters including GABA and glutamate play novel morphogenic roles during development of the mammalian CNS. During forebrain neurogenesis, glutamate regulates neuroblast proliferation in different germinal domains using receptor subtype-specific mechanisms. For example, ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors mediate distinct proliferative effects in ventral or dorsal forebrain germinal domains, and regulate the correct number of neurons that populate the striatum or cerebral cortex. Recent work suggests metabotropic receptors may also mediate glutamate's proliferative effects. Group I mGluR5 receptor subtypes are highly expressed in forebrain germinal zones. Using in vitro and in vivo methods, we demonstrate mGluR5 receptor activation plays an important role in neuroblast proliferation in the ventral telencephalon, and helps determine the complement of striatum projection neurons. mGluR5 receptor-mediated effects on striatal neuronal progenitors are restricted mainly to early cycling populations in the ventricular zone, with little effect on secondary proliferative populations in the subventricular zone. In contrast to proliferative effects in the ventral telencephalon, mGluR5 receptors do not modulate proliferation of dorsal telencephalon-derived cortical neuroblasts. Heterogeneous domain-specific proliferative effects of glutamate-mediated by specific receptor subtypes provide an important developmental mechanism allowing generation of the correct complement of neuronal subtypes that populate the mammalian forebrain.

In experiment 1, 40 participants rated 15 odors for their pleasantness, intensity, and arousal. In experiment 2, 30 participants passively smelled 10 odors while their skin conductance (SC), heart rate (HR), and sniffing were recorded. We found significant overall effects of odor names on perceived pleasantness, intensity, and arousal. Pleasantness showed the most robust effect of odor names: the same odors were perceived as more pleasant when presented with positive than with neutral and negative names and when presented with neutral than with negative names. In addition, odorants were rated as more intense when presented with negative than with neutral and positive names and as more arousing when presented with positive than with neutral names. Furthermore, SC and sniff volumes, but not HR, were modified by odor names, and the SC changes could not be accounted for by sniffing changes. Importantly, odor names presented with odorless water did not produce any effect on skin conductance and sniff volumes, ruling out the possibility that the naming-related findings were triggered by an emotional reaction to odor names. Taken together, these experiments show that there is a lot to a name, at least when it comes to olfactory perception.

The ferro- and silico-Mn alloy plant opened in 1973 and closed in 1991. The airborne total Mn (TMn) exposures for job groupings were established using personal sampling data from a 1991 industrial hygiene survey. Historical short-term total dust (TDust) data were used to estimate past TDust exposure for job groupings and plant areas. Relationships between Mn content and TDust from the 1991 survey, supported by sparse historical data, were used to estimate TMn content in the historical TDust data. Results showed past personal TDust exposure levels much higher than those found in 1991. Changes in TDust levels and corresponding TMn levels were a function of changes in ventilation, work practices, and operations, not of product (ferro- or silico-Mn). Relationships between TMn and respirable Mn (RMn) from area sampling in 1991 were used to estimate RMn exposure for the job groups. Work histories for 112 workers were developed from payroll records, questionnaires, and interviews and combined with Mn exposure estimates to develop cumulative exposure indices (CEIs). The TMn CEI ranged from 0.27 mg/m(3) years to 100.24 mg/m(3) years, with an AM of 24.40 mg/m(3) years and a GM of 14.06 mg/m(3) years. The RMn CEI had an AM of 2.95 mg/m3 years and a GM of 1.78 mg/m(3) years with a range of 0.05-12.03 mg/m(3) years. Overall average TMn exposure intensity, the TMn CEI divided by time worked in years for each worker, had an AM of 1.6 mg Mn/m(3), a GM of 1.0 mg Mn/m(3), range 0.02-6.2 6 mg Mn/m(3). The results of the 2004 follow-up study showed several concentration-response relationships between TMn CEI and neurobehavioral outcomes, which suggest that increase in cumulative TMn exposure level has long-term consequences on the nervous system.

Nine pairs of embalmed cadaveric shoulders were dissected. Crucial structures were identified, and their relationship with various bony and soft-tissue reference points was documented. Identification of the dense fibrous band, at the confluence of the teres major and latissimus dorsi musculotendinous unit, facilitates localization of the radial nerve, which crosses deep to this landmark. The axillary nerve can be seen to exit the quadrangular space 27 mm medial to the latissimus dorsi insertion into the proximal humerus, whereas the thoracodorsal neurovascular pedicle inserts into the latissimus dorsi 110 mm from the humeral tendon's humeral attachment. Harvest of the latissimus dorsi tendon can be safely accomplished by identifying the dense fibrous band and releasing the tendon within 2 cm of its humeral attachment.

Methods: A man with chronic C6 AIS B (motor complete and sensory incomplete) spinal cord injury (SCI), I year after injury, completed 2 blocks of LT over a 9-month training period (35-session block followed by 8.6 weeks of no training and then a 62-session block). Results: Before training, muscle activation was minimal for any muscle examined, whereas after the 2 blocks of LT (97 sessions), hip and knee muscle activation patterns for the bilateral rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and gastrocnemius were in phase with the kinematics. Mean EMG amplitude increased for all bilateral muscles and burst duration increased for rectus femoris and gastrocnemius muscles, whereas burst duration decreased for the biceps femoris after 62 LT sessions. Before LT, left biceps femoris had a pattern that reflected muscle stretch, whereas after training, muscle stretch of the left biceps femoris could not totally account for mean EMG amplitude or burst duration. After the 62 training sessions, total BMD decreased (1.54%), and regional BMD decreased (legs: 6.72%). Total weight increased, lean mass decreased (6.6%), and fat mass increased (7.4%) in the arms, whereas fat mass decreased (3.5%) and lean mass increased (4%) in the legs. Conclusions: LT can induce positive neural and body composition changes in a nonambulatory person with chronic SCI, indicating that neuromuscular plasticity can be induced by repetitive locomotor training after a motor complete SCI.

In this study, we assessed the differential effects of risperidone and haloperidol on verbal memory, attention, and psychiatric symptoms in SC. The performance of 28 SC participants, randomly assigned to risperidone (2-6 mg/day) or haloperidol (2-40 mg/day), was compared with that of healthy controls. The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), the d2 Cancellation Test, and the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale were administered at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Relative to controls, all SC participants showed markedly impaired verbal memory and processing speed at each assessment period. There was no differential effect between the two NLPs and CVLT and d2 performance. However, risperidone was more effective than haloperidol in reducing psychiatric symptoms. Improvement in symptom severity was not associated with improvement in neurocognitive performance on these specific tests. Neither conventional nor atypical neuroleptic medications improved neurocognitive functioning over a 12-month follow-up, suggesting that psychopathological improvement under risperidone is independent of cognitive functions.

The spike glycoprotein of murine coronavirus MHV-JHM mediates receptor-independent infection and spread in the central nervous systems of Ceacam1a(-/-) mice	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY			English	Article							MOUSE HEPATITIS-VIRUS; RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS; CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN FAMILY; NEUROTROPIC CORONAVIRUS; MACROPHAGE INFILTRATION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; STRAIN JHM; CELL; EXPRESSION; PROTEIN	The MHV-JHM strain of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus is much more neurovirulent than the MHV-A59 strain, although both strains use murine CEACAM1a (mCEACAM1a) as the receptor to infect murine cells. We previously showed that Ceacam1a(-/-) mice are completely resistant to MHV-A59 infection (E. Hemmila et al., J. Virol. 78:10156-10165, 2004). In vitro, MHV-JHM, but not MHV-A59, can spread from infected murine cells to cells that lack mCEACAM1a, a phenomenon called receptor-independent spread. To determine whether MHV-JHM could infect and spread in the brain independent of mCEACAM1a, we inoculated Ceacam1a(-/-) mice. Although Ceacam1a(-/-) mice were completely resistant to i.c. inoculation with 10(6) PFU of recombinant wild-type MHV-A59 (RA59) virus, these mice were killed by recombinant MHV-JHM (RJHM) and a chimeric virus containing the spike of MHV-JHM in the MHV-A59 genome (SJHM/RA59). Immunohistochemistry showed that RJHM and SJHM/RA59 infected all neural cell types and induced severe microgliosis in both Ceacam1a(-/-) and wild-type mice. For RJHM, the 50% lethal dose (LD50) is < 10(1.3) in wild-type mice and 10(3.1) in Ceacam1a(-/-) mice. For SJHM/RA59, the LD50 is < 10(1.3) in wild-type mice and 10(3.6) in Ceacam1a(-/-) mice. This study shows that infection and spread of MHV-JHM in the brain are dependent upon the viral spike glycoprotein. RJHM can initiate infection in the brains of Ceacam1a(-/-) mice, but expression of mCEACAM1a increases susceptibility to infection. The spread of infection in the brain is mCEACAM1a independent. Thus, the ability of the MHV-JHM spike to mediate mCEACAM1a-independent spread in the brain is likely an important factor in the severe neurovirulence of MHV-JHM in wild-type mice.

Biological motion perception is cue-invariant	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						biological motion; second-order; motion; cue-invariance	2ND-ORDER MOTION; PERSON IDENTIFICATION; PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION; KINEMATIC CUES; BRAIN-AREAS; FIRST-ORDER; OPTIC FLOW; HUMAN GAIT; PATTERNS; GENDER	Previous work investigating whether biological motion is supported by local second-order motion has been contradictory, with different groups finding either a difference or no difference in performance compared to that obtained with first-order stimuli. Here we show psychophysically, using randomized-polarity and contrast-modulated stimuli, that detection of second-order biological motion walkers is worse for stimuli defined by second-order cues, but this difference is explained by a difference in visibility of the local motion in the stimuli. By mixing first-order and second-order dots within the same stimulus, we show that, when the two types of dot are equally visible, first-order noise dots can mask a second-order walker, and vice-versa. We also show that direction-discrimination of normal, inverted and scrambled walkers follow the same pattern for second-order as that obtained with first-order stimuli. These results are consistent with biological motion being processed by a mechanism that is cue-invariant.

The present study aimed to examine infants' coherence thresholds to radial optic flow motion during the first months of life. Using a forced-choice preferential looking technique, infants' sensitivities were measured with a moving radial stimulus varying in coherence on one side and a corresponding non-directional radial noise pattern on the other. Coherence thresholds for 11 infants from each of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months of age groups were studied by a constant stimuli method. In the second experiment, seven infants were followed longitudinally (tested at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months) using the same stimuli. Results of both studies demonstrated significant improvement for the sensitivity of expanding radial motion during the first months of life. Finally, the 2 directions of radial motion were tested (expanding and contracting) for participants followed longitudinally (from 2 to 8 months). Data showed superior sensitivity for expansion versus contraction direction of motion. This dissociation may suggest that sensitivity to direction corresponding with forward locomotion (expansion) develops at a faster rate than the opposite direction encountered when moving backwards (contraction). The sensitivity improvement for expanding patterns likely reflects the maturation of cerebral areas subtending motion integration in infancy.

According to the "interaction hypothesis" (IH), the older the L2 learner. the less likely the learner is able to establish new vowel categories needed for accurate L2 vowel production and perception because, with age, L1 vowel categories become more likely to perceptually encompass neighboring L2 vowels. These I H predictions were evaluated in two experiments involving 64 native Korean- and English-speaking children and adults. Experiment 1 determined, as predicted, that the Korean children were less likely than the Korean adults to perceive L2 vowels its instances of a single L I vowel category. Experiment 2 showed that the Korean children Surpassed the Korean adults in production of certain vowels but equaled them in vowel perception. These findings, which partially support the IH, are discussed in relation to L2 speech learning.

To date, however, little is known with respect to the characteristics of the learning impairments, nor to the neural correlates associated with this type of procedural deficit in DD patients. Here, we first summarize the results of the few behavioral and brain imaging studies that have investigated the effects of DD on motor sequence learning. To help guide research in this field, we then discuss relevant psychophysical and neuroimaging work conducted in healthy volunteers in relation to three different conceptual perspectives: when, how, and what. More specifically, we examine the cognitive boundaries that affect performance across the different stages of learning (i.e., "when"), the different cognitive processes (i.e., "how") under which learning occurs, and the mental representations (i.e., "what") that are elicited when acquiring this type of skilled behavior. It is hoped that this conceptual framework will be useful to researchers interested in further studying the nature of the motor learning impairment: reported in DD.

Small FCD lesions are difficult to distinguish from normal cortex and remain often overlooked on radiological MRT inspection. This paper presents a method to detect small FCD lesions on T1-MRI relying oil surface-based features that model their textural and morphometric characteristics. The automatic detection was performed by a. two step classification. First, a vertex-wise classifier based on a neural-network bagging, trained on manual labels. Then, a cluster-wise classification designed to remove false positive clusters. The method was tested on 19 patients with small FGD. At the first classification step; 18/19 (95%) lesions were detected. The second classification step kept 13/19 (68%) lesions and decreased efficiently the amount of false positive. This new approach may assist the presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable, epilepsy especially those with unremarkable MRI findings.

However, it does not allow differentiating volume variations from shifting and/or bending. We propose a new approach to quantify local volume changes by computing the surface-based Jacobian determinant. This measurement is computed on the displacement vector fields estimated by a heat equation interpolation on the displacement vectors produced by SPHARM. Data simulation showed that the surface-based Jacobian determinant enables accurate quantification of local volume changes without interference of shifting/bending. In patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and left hippocampal atrophy, SPHARM detected widespread inward deformation related to atrophy in the hippocampal head and body, and showed areas of mirrored inward/outward deformations mostly at the level of the hippocampal tail. In these areas, the surface-based Jacobian determinant showed atrophy. Our method facilitates the interpretation of SPHARM because it allows decomposing volume changes and shifting/bending. Furthermore, it provides a better delineation of the extent of hippocampal atrophy.

Even if the myelination is a continuous process, it is useful to characterize myelination evolution in normal brain development in order to better study demyelinating diseases. The quantification of myelination has only been studied for neonates. The original contribution of this study is to develop a method to characterize. and visualize the myelination pattern using MRI data from a group of normal subjects from birth to just over 4 years of age. The method includes brain extraction and tissue classification in addition to the analysis of T2 relaxation times to attempt to separate myelinated and unmyelinated white matter. The results agree previously published qualitative observations.	[Aubert-Broche, B.; Fonov, V.; Leppert, I.; Pike, G. B.; Collins, D.

Our experimental results showed that there were no significant difference in global and local efficiency between mate and female. However, the gender-related effects on nodal efficiency were found at several brain regions, including the left middle frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, left middle cingulum gyrus, left hippocampus, right hippocampus, right parahippocampal and left amygdala. These results were compatible with previous findings. To our knowledge, this study provided the first evidence of gender effect on the efficiency of brain functional networks using resting-state fMRI.

We provide in this paper a V&V perspective on the nature of HFN components, an appropriate life-cycle, and applicable systematic formal testing approaches. We consider why HFN V&V may be both easier and harder than traditional means, and we conclude with a series of practical V&V guidelines. Validation of HFN systems brings us to a systematic study of value approximation performed during the inference phase.

These performances are, to a certain degree, robust against perturbations, and it often suffices to present a new pattern a few times only until it can be "picked up". From an abstract mathematical perspective, this implies that the brain, as a dynamical system, (1) hosts a very large number of cyclic attractors, such that (2) if the system is driven by external input with a cyclic motif, it can entrain to a closely corresponding attractor in a very short time. This chapter proposes a simple recurrent neural network architecture which displays these dynamical phenomena. The model builds on echo state networks (ESNs), which have recently become popular in machine learning and computational neuroscience.

Modulation of cortical activation and behavioral arousal by cholinergic and orexinergic systems	MOLECULAR AND BIOPHYSICAL MECHANISMS OF AROUSAL, ALERTNESS, AND ATTENTION	ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES		English	Article						acetylcholine; orexin; hypocretin; noradrenaline; sleep-wake states	PONTINE RETICULAR-FORMATION; BASAL FOREBRAIN NEURONS; M2 MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR; PARADOXICAL SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; C-FOS EXPRESSION; REM-SLEEP; HYPOCRETIN-OREXIN; LOCUS-COERULEUS; BRAIN-STEM; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE	Multiple neuronal systems contribute to the promotion and maintenance of the wake state, which is characterized by cortical activation and behavioral arousal. Using predominantly glutamate as a neurotransmitter, neurons within the reticular formation of the brainstem give rise to either ascending projections into the forebrain or descending projections into the spinal cord to promote through relays fast cortical activity or motor activity with postural muscle tone. Using acetylcholine, cholinergic neurons in the brainstem project to forebrain relays and others in the basal forebrain to the cortex, by which they stimulate fast gamma activity during waking and during rapid eye movement or paradoxical sleep (PS). Other neuromodulatory systems, such as noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons, give rise to highly diffuse projections through brain and spinal cord and simultaneously stimulate cortical activation and behavioral arousal. Although such neuromodulatory systems were thought to be redundant, a recently discovered peptide called orexin (Orx) or hypocretin, contained in diffusely projecting neurons of the hypothalamus, was found to be essential for the maintenance of waking with muscle tone, since in its absence narcolepsy with cataplexy occurred. Orx neurons discharge during active waking and cease firing during sleep. Since cholinergic neurons discharge during waking and PS, they would stimulate cortical activation in association with muscle tone when orexinergic neurons are also active but would stimulate cortical activation with muscle atonia when orexinergic neurons are silent, as in natural PS, or absent, as in pathological narcolepsy with cataplexy.

In order to elucidate potential functions of imp13 in the heart, we have used rat imp13 as bait to screen a human heart cDNA library and identified an interaction with the C-terminal peptide of myopodin (a.a. 360-698), an actin-bundling protein, associated with tumor-suppressor activity that localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. We have used GST-pull down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments to demonstrate an interaction between imp13 and full-length myopodin and observed that RanGTP dissociates the myopodin-imp13 complex. In studies of cultured cells, we show that both imp13 siRNA and a C-terminal fragment of imp13 protein prevent nuclear localization of myopodin. We, therefore, conclude that imp13 functions in myopodin import and we suggest that the regulation of these events is critical for normal and abnormal cellular differentiation.

In an attempt to overcome these hurdles, polyether-copolyester (PEPE) dendrimers were evaluated as drug carriers for the treatment of gliomas. Dendrimers were conjugated to D-glucosamine as the ligand for enhancing BBB permeability and tumor targeting. The efficacy of methotrexate (MTX)-loaded dendrimers was established against U87 MG and U 343 MGa cells. Permeability of rhodamine-labeled dendrimers and MTX-loaded dendrimers across the in vitro BBB model and their distribution into avascular human glioma tumor spheroids was also studied. Glucosylated dendrimers were found to be endocytosed in significantly higher amounts than nonglucosylated dendrimers by both the cell lines. IC50 of MTX after loading in dendrimers was lower than that of the free MTX, suggesting that loading MTX in PEPE dendrimers increased its potency. Similar higher activity of MTX-loaded glucosylated and nonglucosylated dendrimers was found in the reduction of tumor spheroid size. These MTX-loaded dendrimers were able to kill even MTX-resistant cells highlighting their ability to overcome MTX resistance. In addition, the amount of MTX-transported across 131313 was three to five times more after loading in the dendrimers. Glucosylation further increased the cumulative permeation of dendrimers across 131313 and hence increased the amount of IVITX available across it. Glucosylated dendrimers distributed through out the avascular tumor spheroids within 6 h, while nonglucosylated dendrimers could do so in 12 h. The results show that glucosamine can be used as an effective ligand not only for targeting glial tumors but also for enhanced permeability across BBB. Thus, glucosylated PEPE dendrimers can serve as potential delivery system for the treatment of gliomas.

It is based on the propagation of near-infrared light through biological tissues. By measuring the optical absorption of the blood in the cortex, DOI enables the estimation of changes of deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) and oxy-hemoglobin (HbO(2)) concentrations. It thus provides indirect information on neuronal activity. Drawbacks of optical imaging are its lack of quantification abilities as well as poor spatial resolution. Although not much can be done concerning the second issue, diffusion being the limiting factor, one can aim at more quantitative data by the use of extra information. As an example, the determination of baseline concentrations done by fitting a temporal or frequency curve to recover background concentrations is not expected to be accurate due to the heterogeneity of the underlying tissues. The vascular architecture, unknown when doing DOI alone, also plays a significant role in the signal detected. Partial volume effects due to an optode pair overlapping a large vein will lead to confounding data and create difficulties in analyzing the neuronal activation. Here we show that fusion with MRI, but done outside the scanner, may help solving some of these issues.

To date, clinicians, researchers and parents use information gleaned from more mature infants to make inferences about pain in ELGA infants. Using physiological or behavioral pain indicators derived from more mature infants may lead to inaccurate assessments and management. Objectives: To compare physiological (heart rate, oxygen saturation) and behavioral (9 facial activities, cry) pain indicators of ELGA infants with infants of varying more mature gestational ages (GAs). Methods: The aim was to determine the effects of GA on pain response. GA was categorized into four mutually exclusive strata: <27 6/7 weeks, 28-31 6/7 weeks, 32-35 6/7 weeks and >36 weeks. Physiological data during four phases of a routine heel lance were collected by placing disposable ECG electrodes and pulse oximetry probes on the infant's chest. Behavioral data were collected by video-taping facial activities, and cry data were collected by audio recording. Results: Four facial activities (brow bulge, eye squeeze, nasolabial furrow, vertical mouth stretch) in response to acute pain were present in ELGA infants. Facial activities increased following painful procedures and the magnitude of responses was proportional to GA with the youngest infants (<27 6/7 weeks GA) showing the least amount of change. Decreased oxygen saturation and increased heart rate were associated with the most invasive phase of the heel lance; however, the differences were neither clinically or statistically significant across age groups. Cry was not a sensitive pain indicator in ELGA infants, due to the presence of endotracheal tubes in this high-risk population. Discussion: ELGA infants have similar pain responses to older infants, but the responses are dampened. Other factors such as severity of illness, frequency of painful procedures or medication use should be examined, as they may influence the pain responses in ELGA infants. Copyright (c) 2007 S.

Homeostatic circulating factors like insulin, glucocorticoids, and leptin that are generally increased by exposure to high fat/high caloric diets constitute important signals in these processes. They trigger functional activation or specific intracellular cascades mediating cellular sensitivity, survival, and synaptic plasticity. Using a model whereby the late fetal and neonatal rat is exposed to increased high fat (HF) via HF feeding of the mother, we investigated the proximal (neonatal) and distal (adult) consequences on metabolism and hippocampal function in the offspring. Adult offspring of HF-fed mothers displayed several of the physiological and behavioral changes susceptible to leading to metabolic complications. These include elevated circulating concentrations of leptin and corticosterone, increased body weight gain and food intake, modest preference for fat-containing food types, as well as the onset of hypothalamic leptin resistance. In the hippocampus, HF-fed offspring or neonates treated with leptin show similar increases in neurogenesis and survival of newborn neurons. We identified some of the direct effects of leptin to increase synaptic proteins, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and glucocorticoid receptors, and to reduce long-term potentiation (LTP) prior to weaning. While these studies have documented effects in animal models, concepts can easily be translated to human nutrition in order to help design better perinatal diets and nutritional preventive measures for mothers in a coordinated effort to curb the obesity trend.

Automated cortical thickness measurements from MRI can accurately separate Alzheimer's patients from normal elderly controls	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; cortical thickness; diagnosis; magnetic resonance imaging	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; GRAY-MATTER LOSS; DISEASE; DEMENTIA; CORTEX; BRAIN; DEFORMATION; VALIDATION; DIAGNOSIS; IMAGES	We investigated the potential of fully automated measurements of cortical thickness to reproduce the clinical diagnosis in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using 19 patients and 17 healthy controls. Thickness maps were analyzed using three different discriminant techniques to separate patients from controls. All analyses were performed using leave-one-out cross-validation to avoid overtraining of the discriminants. The results show regionally variant patterns of discrimination ability, with over 90% accuracy obtained in the medial temporal lobes and other limbic structures. Multivariate discriminant analysis produced 100% accuracy with six different combinations, all involving the parahippocampal gyrus. We therefore propose automated measurements of cortical thickness as a tool to improve the clinical diagnosis of probable AD, as well as a research method to gain unique insight into the etiology of cortical pathology in the disease.

She was convinced of a genetic defect that caused autobiographical memory and emotional deficits and made life 'senseless'. Neuropsychological tests revealed dysfunctions in remembering emotional details of personal episodes and theory of mind. Water positron emission tomography ((15)O) with a paradigm used in a former study by Fink et al. (1996) with healthy controls elicited abnormal activations during autobiographical memory retrieval characterised by a lack of prefrontal and limbic activity. We conclude that these imaging findings reflect neural correlates of the self-reported and objectified autobiographical dysfunctions. Furthermore, they indicate that beliefs or prejudices may have a major impact on the brain's processing of the personal past.

On the other hand, high levels of iA beta resembling the pathological and microscopically visible accumulation of this amyloid peptide, akin to that observed in Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, disrupt CRE-regulated gene expression, therefore compromising the protein synthesis-dependent component of long-term potentiation (the 'load' A beta?). Moreover, intracellular pathology would be independent and additive to the toxic effects of the extracellular A beta burden. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.	[Cuello, A.

Alternative mode of presentation of Kanizsa figures sheds new light on the chronometry of the mechanisms underlying the perception of illusory figures	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Kanizsa figure; modal completion; amodal completion; P1; N1; evoked potentials	VISUAL-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SIMULTANEOUS BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST; AMODAL BOUNDARY COMPLETION; BILATERAL STIMULUS ARRAYS; INDEX FOCUSED ATTENTION; SUBJECTIVE CONTOURS; APPARENT DEPTH; POGGENDORFF ILLUSION; COGNITIVE CONTOURS	The mechanisms responsible for the perception of illusory modal figures are usually studied by presenting entire Kanizsa figures at stimulus onset. However, with this mode of presentation, the brain activity generated by the inducers (the 'pacmen') is difficult to differentiate from the activity underlying the perception of the illusory figure. Therefore, in addition to this usual presentation mode, we used an alternative presentation mode. Inducer disks remained permanently on the screen and the illusory figure was induced by just removing the notches from the disks. The results support the heuristic value of this alternative mode of presentation. The P1 deflection of the visual evoked potentials (VEPs) was found to be greater for the illusory modal figure than for its control and for an amodal figure. This modulation is one of the earliest direct evidences for a low-level processing of illusory forms in the human brain. Meanwhile, larger N1s were obtained for the control figures than for the illusory figures in the notch mode of presentation. While this new type of N1 modulation could shed some light on the stage of processing indexed by this deflection, several propositions are put forward to account for the P1 and N1 variations found.

Evidence for the role of the right auditory cortex in fine pitch resolution	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						fMRI; hemispheric functional specialization; normal brain; planum temporale	SOUND REPRESENTATION; TEMPORAL CORTEX; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; BRAIN; FMRI; LATERALIZATION; NEUROANATOMY; INFORMATION; ASYMMETRY	The neural basis of human pitch perception is not fully understood. It has been argued that the auditory cortices in the two hemispheres are specialized, such that certain right auditory cortical regions have a relatively finer resolution in the frequency domain than homologous regions in the left auditory cortex, but this concept has not been tested directly. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test this specific prediction. Healthy volunteers were scanned while passively listening to pure-tone melodic-like sequences in which the pitch distance between consecutive tones was varied in a parametric fashion. As predicted, brain activation in a region of right lateral auditory cortex, corresponding to the planum temporale, was linearly responsive to increasing, pitch distance, even across the fine changes in pitch. In contrast, the BOLD signal at the homologous left cortical region was relatively constant as a function of pitch distance, except at the largest pitch change. The results support the model of relative hemispheric specialization and indicate that the right secondary auditory cortex has a finer pitch resolution than the left. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the amygdala is believed to be critically implicated in memory for emotionally arousing information and because it is part of the primary olfactory area, we hypothesized that patients with a unilateral medial temporal-lobe resection including the amygdala would not show enhanced memory for arousing compared to nonarousing odors. We tested odor memory in 19 patients (10 left, 9 right) who had undergone a unilateral medial temporal-lobe resection including the amygdala (MTLR) for treatment of intractable epilepsy and 19 healthy control subjects. Healthy individuals and patients with left or right MTLR showed comparable subjective emotional reactions to odors. Similarly, healthy individuals and patients with MTLR remembered unpleasant odors better than pleasant ones. However, unlike healthy individuals, patients with MTLR did not show better memory for emotionally arousing odors compared to nonarousing ones. Patients undergoing a MTLR, whether in the left or right hemisphere, lose the specific memory advantage that odors causing strong emotional reactions normally have. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An fMRI investigation of memory encoding in PTSD: Influence of symptom severity	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; magnetic resonance imaging; memory; encoding; medial frontal cortex; amygdala	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CHILDHOOD SEXUAL-ABUSE; SCRIPT-DRIVEN IMAGERY; EPISODIC MEMORY; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; AMYGDALA RESPONSE; EMOTIONAL MEMORY; VIETNAM VETERANS	Previous studies have shown memory deficits in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) patients, as well as abnormal patterns of brain activity, especially when retrieving trauma-related information. This study extended previous findings by investigating the neural correlates of successful memory encoding of trauma-unrelated stimuli and their relationship with PTSD symptom severity. We used the subsequent memory paradigm, in the context of event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, in 27 PTSD patients to identify the brain regions involved in the encoding of fearful and neutral faces. Symptom severity was assessed by the Clinically Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores. It was found that memory performance was negatively correlated with CAPS scores. Furthermore, a negative correlation was observed between CAPS scores and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity elicited by the subsequently forgotten faces. Finally, symptom severity predicted the contribution of the amygdala to the successful encoding of fearful faces. These results confirm the roles of the vmPFC and the amygdala in PTSD and highlight the importance of taking into account individual differences when assessing the behavioural and neural correlates of the disorder.

In this paper, we review recent progress on the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on resting-state fMRI. First, we briefly introduce some AD-related studies from other groups. Then we describe our AD-related work in detail from three aspects: (1) alterations in regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the fMRI signal in the resting state, (2) altered patterns of functional connectivity from regions of interest and whole brain analyses, and (3) discriminative analyses based on classification features from resting-state fMRI data for differentiating AD patients from healthy elders. Finally, we summarize the main results and some prospects for future work. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, different components implicated in task switching were assessed in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD), persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and their matched healthy controls. The procedure implicated presentation of a two-digit stimulus, and task switching involved either conceptual or spatial switching. Global switching was measured by comparing blocks that involved non-switch trials to blocks that included switch trials,whereas local switching was measured by comparing performance across single trials in the switch blocks. Furthermore, the paradigm measured practice effects. Persons with AD showed larger local and global switch cost than healthy controls suggesting that their deficits encompass both reconfiguration of new action sets and maintenance of potentially relevant tasks within working memory. Importantly, the deficit was large in spatial switching but negligible in the conceptual condition. Persons with MCI only showed global switching impairment, suggesting a deficit restricted to the concurrent maintenance of two relevant task sets, and as in AD, this impairment was limited to spatial switching. Interestingly, persons with MCI, but not AD patients, improved their switching capacities upon practice. These findings indicate that switching deficit is selective in both MCI and AD persons, and is thus supportive of the notion that different mechanisms are involved in task switching. The pattern across condition is coherent with a continuum between those two clinical groups. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activation evoked by tactile and thermal pain stimulation in two individuals with callosal agenesis, one callosotomized patient, and six control subjects. Bilateral tactile activation was found in S1 and/or S2 of both hemispheres in control and acallosal subjects whereas no ipsilateral activation was detected in these structures in the callosotomized participant. In contrast, although there was some inter-individual variability in the pattern of responses to pain, all subjects including the callosotomized patient showed ipsilateral responses in at least two of the target pain-related areas (S1, S2, insula and/or cingulate cortex). These findings are consistent with the plasticity of the touch system in callosal agenesis and further confirm that ipsilateral activation of pain-related regions does not require the integrity of the corpus callosum.

The second aim was to investigate the effect of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) on motor performance. A total of 55 patients with TD were recruited at baseline from participants in a behavioural management programme. A comparison group of 55 patients suffering from a variety of habit disorders (HD) involving complex manual movements, were matched on age and level of education to 34 non-psychiatric controls. Participants were evaluated pre- and post-treatment and post-waitlist with a neuropsychological evaluation focusing on executive function (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST) and skilled motor performance (Purdue Pegboard, Hole Steadiness Test, and the Groove Test). Results revealed WCST scores in the normal range, while motor performance differed significantly on the Purdue Pegboard Tests in both TD and HD as compared to the control group. Cognitive-behavioural treatment selectively improved motor performance in both clinical groups compared to waitlist control, and this improvement related to clinical outcome measures.

Bilateral hippocampal volume increase in patients with bipolar disorder and short-term lithium treatment	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						bipolar disorder; lithium; hippocampus; volume; MRI	TEMPORAL-LOBE STRUCTURES; MOOD STABILIZERS; HUMAN BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MRI; AMYGDALA; DEPRESSION; TARGET; ADULTS; NEUROPROTECTION	Most previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) report similar hippocampus (HC) volumes across patients and controls, but because patients studied were heterogeneous with respect to course of illness variables and medication status, the conclusions of these studies remain equivocal. Lithium (Li) is the reference-standard drug for BD and its role as an important agent in neuroprotection and neurogenesis has been documented in human and in animal studies. We compared the volume of the HC, hippocampal head (Hh), and body/tail (Hbt) in three groups with no history of medication use before entry into this study: (a) a group of patients treated with Li for 1-8 weeks and then scanned; (b) a group comprised of patients who were unmedicated at the time of scan; and (c) a group of patients treated with either valproic acid or lamotrigine. Healthy age- and sex-matched comparison subjects were also scanned. HC volumes did not differ between the unmedicated and healthy comparison groups. There was a bilateral increase in volumes of HC and Hh in the Li-treated group compared to the unmedicated group, an effect that was apparent even over a brief treatment period.

However, observed effect sizes have been small and few replicated polymorphisms have been identified. There are many reasons for the lack of one-to-one correspondence between genotype and phenotype in ADHD. Endophenotypes are non-clinical markers of genetic risk which may facilitate gene discovery in complex disorders like ADHD. The most common endophenotypes under consideration in ADHD are neuropsychological measures of executive function, although a range of psychological, physiological and neuroanatomical endophenotypes have been proposed. If carefully chosen, endophenotypes have the potential to increase the power of genetic research to identify susceptibility genes. If not carefully selected, endophenotypes may generate false negative and false positive results. This paper reviews the theoretical rationale for endophenotypes and proposes a priori criteria by which ADHD endophenotypes should be selected and validated. The literature on motor response inhibition is reviewed to illustrate the validation process which is recommended in the selection of other candidate endophenotypes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AL is the bodily 'wear and tear' that emerges with sustained allostatic states. In the field of bipolar disorder (131)), AL offers an important clue as to why patients who undergo recurrent mood episodes are clinically perceived as less resilient. In addition, AL helps explaining the cumulative disruptive health effects of intermittent episodes and stressors. Stress- and episode-induced changes in brain regions involved in the emotional circuitry may lead to dysfunctional processing of information, which would render BD patients more vulnerable to subsequent environmental stressors, episodes, and drugs of abuse. Mood stabilizing agents exert opposite effects than chronic stress in neurons, increasing neuroprotective factors what may help to quench the cycle of affective episode recurrence and neural and bodily deterioration. Therefore, AL provides an explanatory link to apparently unrelated findings such as cognitive impairment and higher rates of physical comorbidity and mortality that are observed in the course of 1313 and further highlight the importance of effective long-term prophylaxis.

Evaluation of patients with cervical flexion deformity includes assessment of global sagittal balance and chin-brow angle. The primary treatment in extreme disabling cases is surgical correction involving a posterior cervical extension osteotomy, which is a technically demanding procedure with considerable risk of neurological injury. To address the potential complications with extension osteotomy, the authors of several reports have described modifications to the surgical technique. These developments incorporate recent advances in anesthesia, neuromonitoring, and spinal instrumentation. Complications associated with the procedure include subluxation at the osteotomy level, spinal cord injury, radiculopathy, dysphagia, and pseudarthrosis. Although the risks of spinal correction are considerable, extension osteotomy remains an effective treatment modality for patients with disabling cervical flexion deformity.

J	Feifer, A; Corcos, J				Feifer, Andrew; Corcos, Jacques			Contemporary role of suprapubic cystostomy in treatment of neuropathic bladder dysfunction in spinal cord injured patients	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Review						neuropathic; spinal cord injury; suprapubic cystostomy; neurogenic bladder; urodynamics	UROLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS; SCREENING CYSTOSCOPY; PERCUTANEOUS PLACEMENT; INDWELLING CATHETERS; MANAGEMENT; DRAINAGE; FEMALE; CANCER; TUBE; QUADRIPLEGICS	Background: The management of neuropathic bladder dysfunction secondary to spinal cord injury is controversial. With the introduction of clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and anti-cholinergic medication, urinary tract deterioration in this population has declined. Nevertheless, this strategy is problematic for patients who are unable to perform CIC. Suprapubic cystostomy (SPC) is widely viewed as a secondary option, which has a high satisfaction rating among patients, with acceptable clinical efficacy. Despite early reports of long-term renal and bladder complications, recent evidence has demonstrated that improved anti-cholinergic pharmacotherapy and bladder maintenance strategies can enhance SPC efficacy, with diminished morbidity. We set out to review the current literature on SPC in the neuropathic bladder setting and to clarify future management direction. Materials: This investigation consisted of a literature search of the MEDLINE and PUBMED databases. Inclusion criteria were related to SPC, indwelling catheterization, urodynamics, spinal cord injury and bladder dysfunction. Our analysis comprised 56 studies, including retrospective analyses and case reports. Investigations regarding surgical technique as well as short and long-term efficacy were also included. Results: Early studies reported accelerated renal deterioration and lower urinary tract complications, including stones, recurrent infections and blocked catheters. Procedural complications were generally rare. In contrast, recent investigations, in which patients were managed with anti-cholinergics, frequent catheter changes and bladder washing, and volume maintenance procedures demonstrated similar morbidity profiles to CIC.

Aim: To investigate the test-retest reliability of the dynamometric passive properties of the PFM in postmenopausal SUI women. Methods: Thirty-two SUI postmenopausal women were converted to two sessions 2 weeks apart. In each session, the measurements were repeated twice. The pelvic floor Musculature was evaluated in four different conditions: (1) forces recorded at minimal aperture (initial passive resistance); (2) passive resistance at maximal aperture; (3) five lengthening and shortening cycles (Forces and passive elastic stiffness (PES) were evaluated at different vaginal apertures. Hysteresis was also calculated.); (4) Percentage of passive resistance loss after 1 min of sustained stretching was computed. The generalizability theory was used to calculate two reliability estimates, the dependability indices (Phi) and the standard error of measurement, (SEM), for one session involving one measurement or the mean of two measurements. Results: Overall. the reliability of the passive properties was good with indices of dependability of 0.75-0.93. The SEMs for forces and PES were 0.24-0.67 N and 0.03-0.10 N/mm, respectively, for mean, maximal and 20-mm apertures, representing an error between 13% and 23%. Passive forces at minimal aperture showed lower reliability (Phi = 0.51-0.57) compared with other vaginal openings. The aperture at a common force of 0.5 N was the only parameter demonstrating a poor reliability (Phi= 0.35). Conclusion: This new approach for assessing PFM passive properties showed enough reliability for highly recommending its inclusion in the PFM assessment of SUI postmenopausal women. Neurourol.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been demonstrated. Here, we examine the possibility that the modulatory effect of music on pain is mediated by the valence (pleasant-unpleasant dimension) of the emotions induced. We report the effects of listening to pleasant and unpleasant music on thermal pain in healthy human volunteers. Eighteen participants evaluated the warmth or pain induced by 40.0, 45.5, 47.0 and 48.5 degrees C thermal stimulations applied to the skin of their forearm while listening to pleasant and unpleasant musical excerpts matched for their high level of arousal (relaxing-stimulating dimension). Compared to a silent control condition, only the pleasant excerpts produced highly significant reductions in both pain intensity and unpleasantness, demonstrating the effect of positive emotions induced by music on pain (Pairwise contrasts with silence: p's < 0.001). Correlation analyses in the pleasant music condition further indicated that pain decreased significantly (p's < 0.05) with increases in self-reports of music pleasantness. In contrast, the unpleasant excerpts did not modulate pain significantly, and warmth perception was not affected by the presence of pleasant or unpleasant music. Those results support the hypothesis that positive emotional valence contributes to music-induced analgesia. These findings call for the integration of music to current methods of pain control.

Thermal treatment of the lumbar intervertebral disc has been suggested for the treatment of chronic discogenic pain. Disc biacuplasty (D-BAC) is a novel procedure that uses two water-cooled radiofrequency electrodes in a bipolar configuration to heat a large volume of the posterior annulus fibrosus. Methods. Seven porcine lumbar discs were treated with D-BAC to assess acute effects on the treated tissue in a "worst-case" in vivo model. Intradiscal and peridiscal temperatures were measured during treatment and histologic analysis was used to assess for evidence of acute thermal injury. Results. Temperature monitoring at designated safety zones outside the disc demonstrated maintenance of near-physiologic conditions while temperature in the inner posterior annulus reached 65 degrees C. Histologic sections of treated discs demonstrated no evidence of thermal damage to the dorsal root ganglia or spinal nerve roots when compared with controls. Increased coarseness of the fibrillar matrix and loss of cellular detail were noted in the nucleus pulposus of treated discs. Discussion. Disc biacuplasty, in a porcine model, achieves suitable temperatures to induce thermal transition of collagen and thermoneurolysis while showing no evidence of damage to neural tissue in safety zones surrounding the disc.

Approximately 20-40% of patients with both typical and atypical CT are non-smokers, while virtually all patients with SCLC are cigarette smokers. Cigarette smoke contains numerous molecules which have been identified as carcinogens. The real impact of nicotine in the development of tumors is not well known. Recent studies show that nicotine upregulates factors of transcription through the nicotinic receptors. The aim of our work was to study the expression of the nicotinic receptors in normal and neoplastic pulmonary NE cells. An immunohistochemical study was carried out with antibodies against NE markers and subunits alpha 7 and beta 2 of nicotinic receptors in 7 normal lungs, 10 CT (8 typical and 2 atypical) and 10 SCLC fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. This study was completed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) detection of alpha 7-subunit nicotinic receptor mRNA expression. Our data showed that beta 2-subunit of nicotinic receptors is never expressed in normal NE cells of lungs and very rarely in NE tumors. In contrast, alpha 7-subunit is constantly found in NE cells in normal lungs. In tumors, its expression is significantly higher in SCLC than in CT (p = 0.009). Thus, alpha 7 subunit nicotinic receptor in a context of chronic nicotinic intoxication seems to be associated with an aggressive phenotype in the spectrum of the NE tumors. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Canadian aboriginal communities, particularly the Cree Nation of Eeyou Istchee, have been identified as a high-risk population. Culturally acceptable treatment options are limited notably for diabetic complications resulting in peripheral neuropathy. Here, we describe results of an ongoing collaborative research project with Cree of Ecyou Istchee to identify botanicals capable of protecting peripheral neuronal precursors from glucose toxicity and glucose deprivation in vitro. Polar fractions of three plant organs (needles, cone, and bark) collected from Picea glauca (Moench) Voss (Pinaceae), were tested for toxicity under normoglucose, glucotoxicity, and glucose deprivation conditions. The profile of phenolic metabolites in each extract was first characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-APCI/MS). We report here that these fractions are well-tolerated by PC12 neuronal precursors under normoglucose conditions. LD50 concentrations of needle extracts exceeded 100 mu g/mL, whereas the LD50 of bark and cone extracts was 40 and 36.4 mu g/mL, respectively We further show that the cytoprotective properties of minhikw after glucose challenge are concentration-dependent and organ-specific. Needle extracts protected PC12 cells from both glucotoxicity and glucose deprivation. Bark extracts had negligible activity. Cone extracts further impaired PC12 cell glucose tolerance. This study provides the first validation of antidiabetic activity of minhikw organs at the cellular level relevant to the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Quality control of multi-component, intact pharmaceutical tablets with three different near-infrared apparatuses	PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR); multivariate data analysis; content uniformity; process analytical technology (PAT); tablets	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SOLID DOSAGE FORMS; CONTENT UNIFORMITY; RELATIVE-HUMIDITY; NIR SPECTROSCOPY; VALIDATION; POWDERS; DRUG; SPECTROPHOTOMETRY; QUANTITATION	The purpose of this study was to develop a robust and versatile near infrared (NIR) analysis protocol for the quality control of intact tablets containing two active pharmaceutical ingredients, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and caffeine, as well as three excipients. Reference samples were prepared and a calibration model built for each apparatus. All components of the formulation were characterized by transmission Measurements with NIR spectroscopy (NIRS). The study was performed with three different Fourier transform NIR apparatuses and chemometric models. Calibration was carried out by the partial least squares regression method and a pre-processing technique to optimize the efficiency of the models. High performance liquid chromatography was the reference method for obtaining active pharmaceutical ingredient concentration values used in model building. It also served as a reference for chemometric model validation. Eighteen samples were analyzed by chemometric modeling to predict each component's concentration. Four out of five ingredients were quantified precisely with the three chemometric models developed. ASA quantification uncertainty ranges were between 1.0 and 1.1 %, and the average error was less than 5% for caffeine. More than 99.9% of tablet content were analyzed and quantified. The results show that a versatile in-line or at-line NIRS method. with three different chemometric models built from three different acquisition apparatuses, can be developed without sample preparation for pharmaceutical tablet quality control of existing products.

The detector emphasizes neural APs by means of an energy-based preprocessor and locates them with a precision comparator. A linear-phase delay filter allows signal buffering to avoid truncated waveforms. The proposed detector isolates the identified waveforms in their entirety and completely preserves their features in order to improve shapes discrimination. The proposed circuit, implemented in a CMOS 0.18-mu m process, achieves ultra low-power consumption as the whole detector dissipates only 781.5 nW. The detector has been validated in simulations with real neural signals and successfully detects APs from the underlying background activity.

Commonly encountered modeling techniques include empirical formulae, equivalent circuits, and black-box models (e.g. neural networks). Important criteria in device modeling are model accuracy, computational simplicity, generality of the modeling approach, and so forth. In this paper, we present a new and systematic CAD algorithm to device modeling based on a concept often referred to as binning. For a given set of data either from measurements or simulations, the proposed algorithm leads to an accurate model comprising of a set of sub-models with best possible accuracy, while keeping the model structure simple. The proposed algorithm is general and can be applied in the context of any black-box modeling technique. In this paper, the algorithm is illustrated for the case of neural network modeling. Resulting models are shown to exhibit relatively better accuracies compared to those developed using a standard modeling approach. Both active and passive modeling examples are presented.

Thus, tuning the prediction model parameters is very crucial to achieve accurate prediction. This work focuses on the design, the empirical evaluation and the analysis of the behavior of training-based models for predicting the throughput of a single link i.e. the incoming input data in Megabit per time interval called granularity. In this work, a neurofuzzy model (alpha_SNF) and the AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) model are used for predicting. Via experimentation on real network traffic of different links, we study the effect of some parameters on the prediction performance in terms of error. These parameters are the amount of data needed to identify the model (i.e. training set), the number of last observations of the throughput (i.e. lag) needed as inputs for the model, the data granularity, variance and packet size distribution. We also investigate the use of exogenous variables as inputs for the model. Exogenous variables are variables which are different from the lags such as the number of packets or sampled data. Experimental results show that training-based models, identified with small training set and using only one lag, can provide accurate prediction. We show that counts of packets and especially large packets can be used to efficiently predict the throughput.

AUTOMATED PRELIMINARY STRUCTURAL ROTOR DESIGN USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND NEURAL NETWORKS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO 2008, VOL 6, PT A			English	Proceedings Paper	53rd ASME Turbo Expo 2008	JUN 09-13, 2008	Berlin, GERMANY	Int Gas Turbine Inst, ASME			OPTIMIZATION	It is important for any design process to have a good starting point in order to reduce the cycle time and the number of design iterations required. This paper presents an automated preliminary structural design system for a gas turbine rotor, using only preliminary aerodynamic data and a simplified structural analysis, with the objective of producing a good, feasible starting solution for the blades and the disc. The process starts with a CBR (case-based reasoning) algorithm Coupled with a databank of existing solutions. The algorithm uses a neural network to choose from among the closest existing rotor solutions and interpolate between them. These designs, along with the interpolated solution, will constitute the initial set of possible designs. An adaptation algorithm then processes each possible design using simplified analysis to compute the estimated sensitivity of the design function with respect to each parameter in the neighbourhood of these design solutions. The algorithm uses those sensitivities to separate the design parameters into several layers according to their relative importance. In a following phase, these design solutions are used to train a Surrogate neural network model for the function, and also as the starting population for a genetic algorithm (GA). The GA is then run, with the objective of minimizing the weight of the rotor while respecting stress and aerodynamics constraints. More parameter sets (beginning with the most important) are gradually added as an input for each GA run. Although this process would not be capable of replacing a detailed design system, as it currently uses only simplified analysis, it can provide a concept designer with a very good starting solution within a relatively short Computing time.

Hospital-to-school transition for children with chronic illness: Meeting the new challenges of an evolving health care system	PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; OF-THE-LITERATURE; DIABETES-MELLITUS; MAINSTREAM SCHOOL; ADOLESCENTS; DISABILITY; CHILDHOOD; DISEASE; CANCER; NEEDS	Chronic illness is common and has a profound impact on the education of affected children. A variety of approaches and programs to facilitate the transition from hospital to school for children with chronic health problems has been described in the literature. Traditional transition plans may no longer be effective because medical service delivery has changed to reduce long-term hospital stays while increasing outpatient care. As a result, comprehensive hospital-to-school transitions increasingly emphasize home and family involvement that includes homebound instruction strategies, flexible school days, using differentiated instructional strategies, increasing child autonomy, and addressing affective issues. This article describes the needs of children with chronic illness, identifies educational programming consistent with the current health care system, and describes current hospital-to-school transition plans that integrate systemic needs of schools and health care systems with the needs of children with chronic illness.

Methods: Three studies (2 of our own) were designed to evaluate the decline of these two components of attention in normal aging and two neurodegenerative diseases. Standardized tests derived from Posner's model of visuospatial attention were administered to normal healthy elderly participants (n = 13), patients suffering from Huntington's disease (HD; n = 17) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 15), and matched control subjects (n = 57). Outcome measures were reaction time (RT) and RT difference score (defined as invalid RT minus valid RT). Results: In healthy elderly participants, the decline was more pronounced for endogenous attention in situations of perceptual conflict. In Alzheimer's disease, there was a significant decline in both attention components, while in HD, voluntary attention was markedly impaired and automatic attention preserved. Conclusions: Normal aging and HD are characterized by decreased endogenous attention in situations of perceptual conflict. Our data support previous findings that older people display impairment of attention in complex perceptual situations. We propose a model which allows for the separation of attention pathologies, thus improving therapeutic strategies for patients and elderly. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Swallowing has also been shown to be associated with prolonged apnea in some clinical populations. What is not known is whether swallowing contributes to apnea or may instead help resolve these clinically significant events. We studied the temporal relationships between swallowing, respiratory pauses and arousal in six preterm infants at term using multi-channel polysomnography and a pharyngeal pressure transducer. Results revealed that swallows occurred more frequently during respiratory pauses and arousal than during control periods. They did not trigger the respiratory pause, however, as most swallows (66%) occurred after respiratory pause onset and were often tightly linked to arousal from sleep. Swallows not associated with respiratory pauses (other than the respiratory inhibition to accommodate swallowing) and arousal occurred consistently during the expiratory phase of the breathing cycle. Results suggest that swallowing and associated arousal serve an airway protective role during sleep and medically stable preterm infants exhibit the mature pattern of respiratory-swallowing coordination by the time they reach term.

The following neurogenetic disorders were first identified in patients from Eastern Canada: AOA-2, Arsacs, HSN-2, Arca-1, HMSN/ACC and Arsal. The population of Eastern Canada, we are convinced, will still allow the identification of new rare forms of hereditary ataxias, spastic parapareses and neuropathies as well as contribute to the uncovering of their mutated genes. We have summarized our current knowledge of the various hereditary ataxias, spastic parapareses and neuropathies in Eastern Canada. The study of the more common and homogenous features of these diseases has been largely completed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

To identify clinical and laboratory variables useful in diffrentiating acute psychosis as a primary manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) from corticosteroid induced psychosis. Five hundred and thirty seven consecutive patients with SLE were studied, with follow-up ranging from 4 to 8.8 years. A standardized medical history, neurological, rheumatologic, and psychiatric examinations and serologic testing were performed in all patients. The type and frequency of risk factors associated with acute psychosis as a primary manifestation of CNS system and corticosteroid induced psychosis was determined using multivariate regression with automatic backward stepwise selection. We identified acute psychosis in 89 of 520 (17.1%) SLE patients. Psychosis primary to CNS involvement was diagnosed in 59 of these patients, corticosteroid induced psychosis in 28 and primary psychotic disorder not related to SLE or medication in two patients. Psychosis secondary to SLE at disease onset occurred in 19 patients and was associated with disease activity (p = 0.001; OR = 2.4; CI = 1.5-6.2). Psychosis during follow-up of SLE was observed in 40 patients and associated with positive antiphospholipid antibodies (p = 0.004; OR = 3.2; CI = 1.9-4.5) and less frequently with renal (p = 0.002; OR = 1.9; CI = 0.0-0.6) and cutaneous (p = 0.04; OR = 1.1; CI = 0.0-0.8) involvement. We identified 28 patients with 38 episodes of psychosis associated with corticosteroid therapy. All the patients had severe active disease and ten of these patients had hypoalbuminemia when psychosis developed. At the time of psychotic event, all the patients were taking prednisone in doses varying from 0.75 to 1 mg/kg day(-1). Psychosis resolved after tapering prednisone down in all patients. Acute psychosis related to SLE was observed in 11.3% of our cohort. Recurrence of primary psychosis was associated with other CNS manifestations related to SLE.

Methods: 408 schizophrenic patients and 172 control subjects were compared with regard to their DRD3 Ser9Gly genotypic and allelic frequencies. In addition, we carried out a family-based association study including 183 pedigrees (472 subjects) using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). Results: No significant differences of genotype or homozygosity distribution were identified between patients and controls. When patients were stratified according to gender, response to treatment, age at onset, no significant differences were observed. Neither allele A (Set), or G (Gly) were preferentially transmitted from parents to affected offspring. Conclusion: The hypothesis that the DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism plays a predisposing role in schizophrenia is not supported by this study. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of obstructive sleep apnea on cognitive function: A comparison between younger and older OSAS patients	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						age; sleep apnea; cognitive function; daytime vigilance; elderly	NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; DEFICITS; MEMORY; VIGILANCE; BRAIN; DEPRIVATION; ADULTS	Background and purpose: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) present cognitive deficits similar to those observed with aging. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of age on cognitive functions in OSAS patients. It was hypothesized that older OSAS patients will exhibit significant cognitive dysfunction relative to younger OSAS patients and controls. Patients and methods: Younger and older OSAS patients were compared to younger and older control subjects (age cut-off set at 50 yrs). Participants underwent a polysomnographic (PSG) and neuropsychological evaluation. Variables were analyzed by two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with two factors: Group (control and OSAS) and Age (younger and older). Additionally, we evaluated the contribution of attentional deficits to cognitive dysfunction for each subgroup of patients by using Spearman correlation coefficients. Results: No Group-by-Age interaction was found for any neuropsychological variables (p < 0.05). However, main Group and Age effects were found. Correlations indicated that attentional deficits contributed importantly to a poorer cognitive performance in younger OSAS patients only (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our results are in agreement with those of the literature for both OSAS-related and aging-related cognitive deficits but did not demonstrate that age interacts with the effects of the OSAS condition to make those cognitive deficits worse.

Despite abundant expression of the entire functional OT system in the developing heart, the biosynthesis and implication of OT prohormones in cardiomyogenesis remain unknown. In the present work, we investigated the involvement of OT-X in cardiac differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Functional studies revealed the OT receptor-mediated cardiomyogenic action of OT-Gly-Lys-Arg (OT-GKR). To obtain further insight into the mechanisms of OT-GKR- induced cardiac effects, we generated ES cell lines overexpressing the OT-GKR gene and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The functionality of the OT-GKR/EGFP construct was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, with further confirmation by radioimmunoassay and immunostaining. Increased spontaneously beating activity of OT-GKR/EGFP-expressing embryoid bodies and elevated expression of GATA-4 and myosin light chain 2v cardiac genes indicated an inductive effect of endogenous OT-GKR on ES cell-derived cardiomyogenesis. Furthermore, patch-clamp experiments demonstrated induction of ventricular phenotypes in OT-GKR/EGFP-transfected and in OT-GKR-treated cardiomyocytes. Increased connexin 43 protein in OT-GKR/EGFP-expressing cells further substantiated the evidence that OT-GKR modifies cardiac differentiation toward the ventricular sublineage. In conclusion, this report provides new evidence of the biological activity of OT-X, notably OT-GKR, during cardiomyogenic differentiation.

As in many jurisdictions, individuals convicted of driving under the influence ( DUI) in the province of Quebec are mandated to relicensing programs, which include obligatory participation in intervention programs. However, prolonged delay in relicensing is widespread, potentially contributing to unlicensed driving, untreated substance misuse problems, and drink-driving risk. Information about the characteristics of DUI offenders who delay relicensing (DR) is sparse. This investigation compares the characteristics of DR offenders with those offenders who do not delay (NoDR). In addition, the rationales of DR offenders for delaying relicensing are explored qualitatively. Methods. Two studies were conducted to explore the characteristics of DR offenders. In Study 1, DR offenders (n = 46) were compared to NoDR offenders (n = 74) on multidimensional measures of psychosocial functioning, driving behavior, substance use, and psychological and neurocognitive characteristics. In Study 2, a qualitative examination of 20 DR offenders' reasons underlying delayed relicensing was undertaken, with verbatims content analyzed to identify major themes. A questionnaire, based upon this preliminary analysis, was then administered to another sample of DR participants (N = 37) to appraise and confirm thematic comprehensiveness. Results. The main findings of Study 1 were that, compared to NoDR offenders, DR offenders had more past DUI convictions, were at greater risk for drink driving per kilometer ( km) driven, were more likely to have received substance abuse treatment, and exhibited indices of poorer neurocognitive performance in visual memory and behavioral inhibition domains. No group differences were uncovered on substance use measures. The findings of Study 2 revealed that the expense of participation, availability of alternate transportation, lack of interest, and no access to a vehicle were the most frequent explanations for delayed relicensing. Conclusions. Overall, these findings suggest that both individual and contextual factors influence timely fulfillment of relicensing requirements. While the cost of relicensing may succeed in removing some offenders from the road, it may also be a barrier for others at risk for drink driving, preventing exposure to needed intervention programs. Reducing this barrier may need to be weighted against the risks of relicensing more DUI offenders. Neurocognitive factors may need to be taken into account to not only decrease delay in relicensing but also increase the benefits from participation in interventions that are part of current relicensing programs.

A new empirical model is proposed for the bias temperature dependence compensation of accelerometers using their input and output data. Experimental testing of the accelerometer is first realized, as data for 2 inputs and 1 output are collected. Based on this data, an empirical model is built using a neuro-fuzzy network, which learns the process behavior and uses a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for model realization. The improvement in the reproduction quality of the experimental surface by the neuro-fuzzy model is achieved through the FIS training using a Sugeno learning algorithm with two inputs and one output. Generation and training of the FIS are performed with Matlab functions, the training of which is realized on a high number of epochs, for example, on a number of 10(5) training epochs. It is noticed that the proposed algorithm leads to a 35.5 times reduction in the error due to temperature dependence of the bias.

Such microsystems are dedicated for interconnections through the peripheral neural systems. Case study related to applications such as bladder control is discussed. Available electrical neurostimulation techniques for the rehabilitation of urinary bladder functions do not allow an, adequate voiding due to dyssynergia between the bladder and the sphincter. A new implantable stimulator, built with commercially available electronic components; was designed to overcome these difficulties. The proposed system performs two types of stimulations: Selective Stimulation for bladder voiding and Permanent Stimulation to reduce the bladder overactivity symptoms. Also, a fully integrated extended version of the stimulator is achieved with the additional ability to monitor the electrodesnerve contact impedance variations in order to detect electrodes faults or nerve physiology changes. The implemented full custom device provides a reliable stimulation technique and addresses the lack of features (programmable parameters, user-friendly interface and waveform, flexibility) of the previous stimulation devices. Experimental results of the fabricated chip confirm its functionality. The microstimulator generates a wide range of stimuli waveforms with variable parameters and its modular architecture makes it an expandable multichannel stimulation system.

Neurons in the supraoculomotor area (SOA) have been found to encode symmetric vergence [Zhang, Y. et al. (1992). J. Neurophysiol., 67: 944-960] while neurons in the central MRF, the cMRF, located ventral to the SOA and lateral to the oculomotor nucleus are associated with conjugate eye movements [Waitzman, D. M. et al. (1996). J. Neurophysiol., 75(4): 1546-1572]. However, it remains unknown if cMRF neurons are strictly associated with conjugate movements since eye movements were recorded with a single eye coil in monkeys viewing visual stimuli at a distance of at least 50 cm. In the current study we addressed whether neurons in the cMRF might also encode vergence-related information. Interestingly, electrical stimulation elicited disconjugate saccades (contralateral eye moved more than the ipsilateral eye) from locations previously thought to elicit only conjugate saccades. Single unit recordings in this same area made in two rhesus monkeys trained to follow visual stimuli moved rapidly in depth along the axis of sight of an individual eye demonstrate that cMRF neurons do not simply encode conjugate information during disconjugate saccades; in fact our findings provide evidence that cMRF neurons are most closely associated with the movement of an individual eye. These results support the hypothesis that the midbrain shapes the activity of the pre-motor saccadic neurons by encoding integrated conjugate and vergence commands.

However, models used for learning in pattern classification are challenged when the differences between the patterns of the training set are small. Therefore, the choice of effective features is mandatory for obtaining good performance. Statistical and geometrical features alone are not suitable for recognition of hand printed characters due to variations in writing styles that may result in deformations of character shapes. We address this problem by using a relational context feature combined with a local descriptor for training a neural network-based recognition system in a user-independent online character recognition application. Our feature extraction approach provides a rich representation of the global shape characteristics, in a considerably compact form. This new relational feature provides a higher distinctiveness and increases robustness with respect to character deformations. While enhancing the recognition accuracy, the feature extraction is computationally simple. We show that the ability to discriminate in Arabic handwriting characters is increased by adopting this mechanism in feed forward neural network architecture. Our experiments on Arabic character recognition show comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods for online recognition of these characters.

The importance of this phenomenon on neural cells is being investigated here in order to evaluate the optimal mechanical environment for their maximum growth. We prepared polyacrylamide gel as a culture medium for the nerve cell growth. Since we hypothesize that the shear modulus of the medium, which is fully saturated with water, plays an important role in the cell growth, we prepared gels having different shear modulus by varying the ratio of the polymerizing agents and the thickness of the medium was controlled by molding. It is the key issue to determine the shear modulus of the gels to study the effect of the modulus on the nerve cell growth. However, because the physical properties of the gels should be measured when those are saturated with water, but there should be no water layer on the surface to prevent slip in rheometers, new techniques were developed to dissolve these issues. This poster will present those rheological techniques, preparation of the gels, and the effect of shear modulus of the gel medium on the growth of nerve cells.

Here, we examine the NMDAR signaling components in the brain of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Compared with mammalian orthologs, high levels of sequence conservation for known functional sites in both NMDAR subunits (NR1, NR2A-C) and signaling proteins (fyn tyrosine kinase, RasGRF-1 and -2) were found. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that, similar to the case in the adult mammal brain, NR2A and NR2B are expressed at moderate levels in most brain regions and at very high levels in the dorsal telencephalon. RasGRF-1 and fyn have a similar distribution and appear to be coexpressed with NR2B in telencephalic regions known to support learning and long-term memory. Both NR2A and NR2B are highly expressed in pyramidal cells of the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) known to exhibit the short-term synaptic plasticity that underlies adaptive feedback cancellation of redundant sensory input. In contrast, nonplastic pyramidal cells expressed only the NR2A subunit. Furthermore, field recordings show that ifenprodil-sensitive NR2B-containing NMDARs predominate for the plastic feedback input to ELL pyramidal cells. However, RasGRF-1 and fyn are expressed only at low levels in a subset of these pyramidal cells. Our data suggest that NMDAR functions are highly conserved between fish and mammals and that synaptic plasticity dynamics in different brain regions are related to the expression patterns of the synaptic signaling proteins interacting with NMDARs.

A prominent feature of the human disorder is self-injurious behavior, suggesting an abnormality in pain processing. Moreover, FMRP regulates group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1/5)-dependent plasticity, which is known to contribute to nociceptive sensitization. We demonstrate here, using the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse, that FMRP plays an important role in pain processing because Fmr1 KO mice showed (1) decreased (similar to 50%) responses to ongoing nociception (phase 2, formalin test), (2) a 3 week delay in the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced allodynia, and (3) a near absence of wind-up responses in ascending sensory fibers after repetitive C-fiber stimulation. We provide evidence that the behavioral deficits are related to a mGluR1/5- and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated mechanism because (1) spinal mGluR5 antagonism failed to inhibit the second phase of the formalin test, and we observed a marked reduction in nociceptive response to an intrathecal injection of an mGluR1/5 agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in Fmr1 KO mice; (2) peripheral DHPG injection had no effect in KO mice yet evoked thermal hyperalgesia in wild types; and (3) the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin inhibited formalin- and DHPG-induced nociception in wild-type but not Fmr1 KO mice. These experiments show that translation regulation via FMRP and mTOR is an important feature of nociceptive plasticity. These observations also support the hypothesis that the persistence of self-injurious behavior observed in fragile X mental retardation patients could be related to deficits in nociceptive sensitization.

Treatment strategies for cocaine addiction and especially the prevention of craving and relapse are limited, and their effectiveness is still questionable. We hypothesized that repeated stimulation of the brain reward system can induce localized neuronal adaptations that may either potentiate or reduce addictive behaviors. The present study was designed to test how repeated interference with the brain reward system using localized electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle at the lateral hypothalamus (LH) or the prefrontal cortex (PFC) affects cocaine addiction-associated behaviors and some of the neuronal adaptations induced by repeated exposure to cocaine. Repeated high-frequency stimulation in either site influenced cocaine, but not sucrose reward-related behaviors. Stimulation of the LH reduced cue-induced seeking behavior, whereas stimulation of the PFC reduced both cocaine-seeking behavior and the motivation for its consumption. The behavioral findings were accompanied by glutamate receptor subtype alterations in the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area, both key structures of the reward system. It is therefore suggested that repeated electrical stimulation of the PFC can become a novel strategy for treating addiction.

We have identified a novel interaction between the C terminus of the EphA4 receptor and the PDZ domain of the GTPase-activating protein spine-associated RapGAP (SPAR). In neuronal cells, this binding mediates EphA4-dependent inactivation of the closely related GTPases Rap1 and Rap2, which have recently been implicated in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity. We show that SPAR-mediated inactivation of Rap1, but not Rap2, is critical for ephrin-A-dependent growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons and decreased integrin-mediated adhesion in neuronal cells. Distinctive effects of constitutively active Rap1 and Rap2 on the morphology of growth cones and dendritic spines support the idea that these two GTPases have different functions in neurons. Together, our data implicate SPAR as an important signaling intermediate that links the EphA4 receptor with Rap GTPase function in the regulation of neuronal morphology.

Netrin-1 and its receptors, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and UNC-5 homologues (UNC-5), continue to be expressed in the adult brain, although neither their function nor the kinds of events that activate their expression are known. Two lines of evidence suggest a role for netrin-1 in amphetamine-induced dopamine plasticity in the adult. First, DCC is highly expressed by adult dopamine neurons. Second, adult mice with reduced DCC levels do not develop amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization. To explore the role of netrin-1 in amphetamine-induced plasticity, we examined the effects of sensitizing treatment regimens of amphetamine on DCC and/or UNC-5 protein expression in the adult rat. These treatments produced striking and enduring increases in DCC and UNC-5 expression in the cell body, but not terminal regions, of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system. Notably, neuroadaptations in the cell body region of mesocorticolimbic dopamine neurons underlie the development of sensitization to the effects of amphetamine. Furthermore, these localized amphetamine-induced changes were prevented by co-treatment with an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, a treatment known to block the development of amphetamine-induced sensitization of behavioral activation, dopamine release and motivated behavior. Using immunohistochemistry, we showed that both DCC and UNC-5 receptors are highly expressed by adult mesocorticolimbic dopamine neurons. These results provide the first evidence that repeated exposure to a stimulant drug such as amphetamine affects netrin-1 receptor expression in the adult brain. Taken together, our findings suggest that changes in netrin-1 receptor expression may play a role in the lasting effects of exposure to amphetamine and other stimulant drugs. (c) 2007 IBRO.

Transmission electron microscopy images reveal that the average diameter of these luminescent nanoparticles is approximately 29 nm, and they contain multiple InGaP@ZnS QDs that have an average diameter between 4 and 5 nm. These new InGaP@ZnS-chitosan nanoparticles emit near the near IR region at 670 nm and are able to penetrate three times deeper into tissue (e.g., even through a mouse skull) while revealing a higher uptake efficiency into PC12 cells with a robust signal. Additionally, a cell viability assay demonstrates that these new fluorescent nanoparticles have good biocompatibility and stability with PC12 cells and neural cells. As a result, these near-IR-emitting nanoparticles can be used for real-time and deep-tissue examination of diverse specimens, such as lymphatic organs, kidneys, hearts, and brains, while leaving the tissue intact.

Here, samples from an Old World species, the vervet monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops), were cross-hybridized to the Rhesus Macaque Genome Array (Affymetrix). Microarray analysis was performed using laser capture microdissected populations of individual neuronal cell bodies isolated from the LGN compared to heterogeneous samples from whole lamina. Our results indicated that cross-species hybridization of microdissected brain tissue samples from vervet monkeys to the Rhesus array produced reliable and biologically relevant data sets. We present the first list of genes enriched in the large neuronal cell bodies of the LGN. We found that these cell bodies are concentrated with genes involved in metabolic processes and protein synthesis, whereas signaling molecules including chemokines and integrins were expressed at higher levels within heterogeneous samples. Our data set also provides support for a contribution of Writ signaling in adult monkey LGN. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Lachance, Pascal E.

This review focuses on new evidence that serotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) may be an important key player, acting locally in mammalian ovaries and female genital tracts where it may influence granulosa and cumulus cells as well as oocytes and early embryos. Pioneering studies reporting 5-HT in ovaries and other female reproductive tissues and cells are now complemented by the identification of specific 5-HT receptor subtypes (5-HTID, 5-HT2A-B and 5-HT7) in granulosa or cumulus cells, oocytes and early embryos. Additional serotonergic players, including the 5-HT transporter (SERT or Slc6A4) expressed in oocytes and embryos, and the 5-HT-producing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1) expressed in cumulus cells, now make up a complete and autonomous local serotonergic network. Direct demonstrations of intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP signaling by 5-HT in cumulus cells and its capacity to regulate progesterone secretion by granulosa cells further illustrate some of its potential functions in ovarian physiology. Recent evidence shows that mouse mothers with knocked-out TPH1 have embryos with impaired early development, establishing that maternal 5-HT is required for normal embryonic development. This local regulation of reproductive processes by 5-HT in mammals might have derived from better-known, and possibly ancestral, serotonergic networks similarly at play in several primitive animals, and potential implications for human reproduction may also be foreseen. Specific roles played by 5-HT in mammalian reproduction remain to be further investigated, and now span from steroidogenesis and oocyte maturation to early embryonic development.

New regulatory principles have emerged, including repression by micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and mRNA sequestration in cytoplasmic granules, and the field has extended its reach into development, brain function, and human disease.

Opioid-induced depression in the lamprey respiratory network	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mu-opioid receptors; respiratory rhythm generation; respiration-related neurons; rostrolateral trigeminal region; DAMGO	SPINAL-CORD PREPARATION; PATTERN GENERATION; RHYTHM GENERATION; IN-VITRO; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; ROSTRAL MEDULLA; NEWBORN RATS; MICE LACKING; BRAIN; NEURONS	The role of opioid receptors in modulating respiratory activity was investigated in in vitro brainstem preparations of adult lampreys by bath application of agonists and antagonists. The vagal motor output was used to monitor respiratory activity. Neuronal recordings were also performed to characterize the rostrolateral trigerninal region that has been suggested to be critical for respiratory rhythmogenesis. Microinjections of the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) were also made into this region and at different locations within the brainstem. Bath application of DAMGO (0.5-2 mu M) caused marked decreases in respiratory frequency up to complete apnea. Bath application of the delta-opioid receptor agonist [D-Pen(2,5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) at 1040 mu M induced less pronounced depressant respiratory effects, while no changes in respiratory activity were induced by the K-Opioid receptor agonist trans-(lS,2S)-3,4-dichloro-N-methylN-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl] benzeneacetamide (U50488) at 10-40 mu M. Bath application of the opioid receptor antagonists naloxone and naltrindole did not affect baseline respiratory activity, but prevented agonist-induced effects. DAMGO microinjections (1 mM; 0.5-1 nI) at sites rostrolateral to the trigerninal motor nucleus, where respiration-related neuronal activity was recorded, abolished the respiratory rhythm. The results show that opioids may have an important role in the lamprey respiratory network and that mu-opioid receptor activation is the most effective in causing respiratory depression. They also indicate that endogenous opioids are not required for the generation of baseline respiratory activity. Apneic responses induced by DAMGO microinjections support the hypothesis that a specific opioid-sensitive region rostrolateral to the trigerninal motor nucleus, that we have termed the paratrigerninal respiratory group (pTRG), likely has a pivotal role in respiratory rhythmogenesis. Since the lamprey diverged from the main vertebrate line around 450 million years ago, our results also imply that the inhibitory role of opioids on respiration is present at an early stage of vertebrate evolution.

Different processing phases for features, figures, and selective attention in the primary visual cortex	NEURON			English	Article							CORTICAL AREAS V1; STIMULUS-DRIVEN; GROUND SEGREGATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; SEARCH; MODULATION; RESPONSES; V2; DISCRIMINATION; REPRESENTATION	Our visual system imposes structure onto images that usually contain a diversity of surfaces, contours, and colors. Psychological theories propose that there are multiple steps in this process that occur in hierarchically organized regions of the cortex: early visual areas register basic features, higher areas bind them into objects, and yet higher areas select the objects that are relevant for behavior. Here we test these theories by recording from the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We demonstrate that the V1 neurons first register the features (at a latency of 48 ms), then segregate figures from the background (after 57 ms), and finally select relevant figures over irrelevant ones (after 137 ms). We conclude that the psychological processing stages map onto distinct time episodes that unfold in the visual cortex after the presentation of a new stimulus, so that area V1 may contribute to all these processing steps.

We observed that the behaviour induced by the use of such devices is so egregious as to be medically informative. We offer a descriptive phenomenology and neuroanatomical classification of aberrant behaviour in relation to cellular telephone use by physicians at medical conferences. Although the cellular telephone is a scourge, its ability to add to the diagnostic armamentarium in cognitive neurology should not be overlooked, especially if a fee code can be attached.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is characterized by a delay in cortical maturation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						cortical development; structural neuroimaging	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; GRAY-MATTER; DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; ANIMAL-MODELS; BRAIN GROWTH; MRI DATA; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS	There is controversy over the nature of the disturbance in brain development that underpins attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In particular, it is unclear whether the disorder results from a delay in brain maturation or whether it represents a complete deviation from the template of typical development. Using computational neuroanatomic techniques, we estimated cortical thickness at > 40,000 cerebral points from 824 magnetic resonance scans acquired prospectively on 223 children with ADHD and 223 typically developing controls. With this sample size, we could define the growth trajectory of each cortical point, delineating a phase of childhood increase followed by adolescent decrease in cortical thickness (a quadratic growth model). From these trajectories, the age of attaining peak cortical thickness was derived and used as an index of cortical maturation. We found maturation to progress in a similar manner regionally in both children with and without ADHD, with primary sensory areas attaining peak cortical thickness before polymodal, high-order association areas. However, there was a marked delay in ADHD in attaining peak thickness throughout most of the cerebrum: the median age by which 50% of the cortical points attained peak thickness for this group was 10.5 years (SE 0.01), which was significantly later than the median age of 7.5 years (SE 0.02) for typically developing controls (log rank test chi(1)(2) = 5,609, P < 1.0 x 10(-20)). The delay was most prominent in prefrontal regions important for control of cognitive processes including attention and motor planning. Neuroanatomic documentation of a delay in regional cortical maturation in ADHD has not been previously reported.

The group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist (R.S)-3.5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) produces SNBs when injected intrathecally, and group I mGluR antagonists are effective at reducing symptoms of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. The present experiments examined whether rats with sciatic nerve injury or persistent inflammation exhibit greater SNBs following intrathecal DHPG compared with control animals. SNBs were observed following intrathecal injection of DHPG (25 nmol) between the L4 and L5 vertebrae. We used a behavioral observation scoring system that allowed for assessment of specific behaviors in the hind paws. When DHPG was injected intrathecally in rats with chronic constriction injury (M) of the sciatic nerve, they showed increased paw stamping behavior compared to DHPG-injected sham controls. Rats treated with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammation failed to demonstrate a significant increase in paw stamping behavior. However, both M and CFA rats showed increased paw licking and biting of the neuropathic/inflamed hind paw after intrathecal DHPG injection. These results provide evidence for behaviorally relevant contributions of group I mGluRs to SNBs in models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, event-related potentials were recorded as participants read sentences terminating in a high or low ND word, which was either congruent or incongruent with the sentence context. High ND words elicited a significantly more positive-going waveform at 150-300 ms post-stimulus onset than low ND words, whereas items seen in incongruent sentence contexts resulted in a larger N400 amplitude than those seen in congruent sentence contexts. We suggest that high ND items result in greater initial global activation in the lexical system, reflected in the early positivity, and that this activation proceeds automatically and independently of context.

The purpose of the present study was to assess the contribution of the corpus callosurn to this type of auditory processing. Noise bursts were presented to 10 control and two callosal agenesis individuals from different positions located within midsagittal and coronal planes. Although acallosal participants were comparable with controls in their ability to correctly identify the trajectory direction or its length, they showed greater capability in detecting motion per se when the task was difficult. These results suggest that in the absence of the corpus callosum, compensatory reorganization of the brain allowed for superior auditory spectral cue processing.

Even in cases of suspected or known abuse, an autopsy may help characterize the nature of the abuse, which is particularly important in the forensic autopsy of children in the first 3 to 4 years of life when inflicted neurotrauma is most common. Forensic examinations are vital in cases that might otherwise be diagnosed as sudden infant death syndrome. The ocular autopsy in particular may demonstrate findings that were not appreciated on antemortem clinical examination. This protocol for postmortem examination of the eyes and orbits was developed to promote more consistent documentation of findings, improved clinical and forensic decision making, and more replicable and coherent research outcomes.

To this end, substantial remodeling of the uterine vasculature occurs with consequent changes in responsiveness to contractile agents. The purpose of our study was to characterize the vasorelaxant effects of estrogens on vascular smooth muscles of the rat uterine artery during pregnancy and to evaluate the involvement of estrogen receptors (ESR) and nitric oxide synthases (NOS). To do so, we measured NOS expression in the whole uterine and mesenteric circulatory bed by Western blotting. Vasorelaxant effects of 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E-2) were assessed on endothelium-denuded uterine arteries with wire myographs in the absence and presence of pharmacological modulators [nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), ICI-182780, tamoxifen]. All experiments were performed on arteries from nonpregnant (NP) and late pregnant (P) rats. In the uterine vasculature of the latter group, NOS3 (endothelial NOS) expression was increased, while NOS1 (neuronal NOS) was reduced compared with NP rats. Expression of the NOS2 (inducible NOS) isoform was undetectable in the two groups. Both 17 beta-E-2 and 17 alpha-E2 induced uterine artery relaxation, but the latter evoked lower responses. Endotheliumdenuded arteries from NP rats showed larger relaxation with 17 beta-E-2 than P rats. This larger relaxation disappeared in the presence of L-NAME. The ESR antagonist ICI-182780 did not affect acute relaxation with 17 beta-E-2 and 17 alpha-E-2. Moreover, membrane-nonpermeant 17 beta-E-2: BSA (estradiol conjugated to bovine serum albumin) did not induce any vasorelaxation. Our results indicate that estrogens exert direct acute vasorelaxant effects in smooth muscles of the rat uterine artery that are mediated by mechanisms independent of ESR activation, but with some stereospecificity. Part of this effect, in NP rats only, is due to nitric oxide produced from muscle NOS1.

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR			English	Review						behavioural flexibility; cognition; contest competition; ecological interactions; kleptoparasitism	KLEPTOPARASITIC BEHAVIOR; TACTICAL DECEPTION; SONG REPERTOIRE; NEOCORTEX SIZE; EVOLUTION; PRIMATES; INTELLIGENCE; ECOLOGY; GULLS; HOST	Kleptoparasitism, the stealing of food items already procured by others, is a widespread foraging strategy in animals, yet the reasons why some taxa have evolved this strategy and others have not remain unresolved. It has been hypothesized that kleptoparasitism should be more pro. table, and hence have more often evolved, in lineages featuring certain characteristics, such as a large body mass, an enlarged brain or a dependence on vertebrate prey. Alternatively, the evolution of kleptoparasitism could have been facilitated in certain ecological contexts, such as open habitats or mixed-species foraging groups. Here, we test these hypotheses for the evolution of food stealing with a comparative analysis in birds, using information on 856 field reports of interspecific kleptoparasitism from all over the world. In multivariate analyses controlling for common ancestry, the probability that a family uses kleptoparasitism was positively associated with residual size of the brain, habitat openness and the presence of vertebrate prey in the diet, but showed no association with body size or participation in mixed-species foraging groups. The conclusion that kleptoparasitism is associated more closely with cognition than with aggression is further supported by the finding that kleptoparasites have a larger residual brain size than their respective hosts, while their body size is not significantly larger. By emphasizing the central role of cognitive abilities in avian kleptoparasitism, our results offer a novel perception of avian food stealing, which in the past was primarily seen in terms of 'brawn' rather than 'brains'.

Oxidized/misfolded superoxide dismutase-1: The cause of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HEREDITARY SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA; MOTOR-NEURONS; ALS MODEL; MUTANT SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE-1; CU,ZN-SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; GENE-MUTATIONS; SPORADIC ALS; FAMILIAL ALS; MOUSE MODEL	The identification in 1993 of superoxide dismutase-1 (SODI) mutations as the cause of 10 to 20% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, which represents 1 to 2% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases, prompted a substantial amount of research into the mechanisms of SODI-mediated toxicity. Recent experiments have demonstrated that oxidation of wild-type SODI leads to its misfolding, causing it to gain many of the same toxic properties as mutant SODI. In vitro studies of oxidized/misfolded SODI and in vivo studies of misfolded SODI have indicated that these protein species are selectively toxic to motor neurons, suggesting that oxidized/misfolded SODI could lead to ALS even in individuals who do not carry an SODI mutation. It has also been reported that glial cells secrete oxidized/misfolded mutant SODI to the extracellular environment, where it can trigger the selective death of motor neurons, offering a possible explanation for the noncell autonomous nature of mutant SODI toxicity and the rapid progression of disease once the First symptoms develop. Therefore, considering that sporadic (SALS) and familial ALS (FALS) cases are clinically indistinguishable, the toxic properties of mutated SODI are similar to that of oxidized/misfolded wild-type SODI (wtSODI), and secreted/extracellular misfolded SODI is selectively toxic to motor neurons, we propose that oxidized/misfolded SODI is the cause of most forms of classic ALS and should be a prime target for the design of ALS treatments.

A review of the literature on Garner's paradigm use with auditory dimensions suggests that the dimensional interactions approach goes beyond the contradictory results of former studies on song processing and enables one to specify on which processing level the interactions occur. Its advantage is to allow one studying the interactions between several dimensions of the lyrics and the tune with one, valid, method. On the contrary, former studies presented much methodological differences. Finally, this approach is applied to healthy subjects and thus avoids the critics against the double dissociation principle.

Trans generational effects of social environment on variations in maternal care and behavioral response to novelty	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						maternal behavior; oxytocin; environment; transgenerational	MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; RECEPTOR-ALPHA EXPRESSION; FEMALE RATS; OXYTOCIN RECEPTORS; EARLY EXPERIENCE; RHESUS-MONKEYS; EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR; STRESS REACTIVITY; VERVET MONKEYS; CHILD-ABUSE	Cross-fostering studies in the rat have illustrated the importance of the postnatal environment in mediating the transmission of maternal licking/grooming (LG) from mother to offspring. The authors addressed the question of how postweaning social conditions can alter the patterns of maternal behavior. Juvenile female offspring of high LG and low LG mothers were placed in either standard, enriched, or impoverished postweaning environments for 50 consecutive days and then mated and observed with their own litters. Analysis of LG behavior indicated that the effect of postweaning environment was dependent on the level of postnatal mother-infant interaction. Postweaning isolation reduced exploratory behavior, maternal LG, and oxytocin receptor binding in the offspring of high LG mothers, whereas social enrichment enhanced exploration, LG behavior, and oxytocin receptor binding of low LG offspring. These effects were also transmitted to the next generation of offspring. Thus, maternal LG and the neural mechanisms that regulate this behavior exhibited a high degree of plasticity in response to changes in environment both within and beyond the postnatal period, with implications for the transmission of behavioral response to novelty and maternal care across generations.

A literature review exposes the motivation and advantages of this approach and leads to a description of the requirements for a set of dedicated steering gradient coils in comparison to standard imaging coils. An experimental set-up was developed to validate the mathematical models and the hypotheses arising from this targeting modality. Magnetite Fe3O4 microparticles (dia. 10.9 mu m) were steered in a Y-shaped 100 mu m diameter microchannel between a Maxwell pair (dB/dz=443 mT/m) located in the center of an MRI bore with 0.525 m/s mean fluid velocity (ten times faster than in arterioles with same diameter). Experimental results based on the percentage of particles retrieved at the targeted outlet show that the mathematical models developed provide an order of magnitude estimate of the magnetic gradient strengths required. Furthermore, these results establish a proof of concept of microparticle steering using magnetic gradients within an MRI bore for applications in the human cardiovascular system.

We first describe the history of the studies on the effects of using exogenous stress hormones such as glucocorticoids as anti-inflammatory medications on human cognition and mental health. Here, we summarize the cases that led to the diagnosis of glucocorticoid-induced 'steroid psychosis' in human populations and which demonstrated that these stress hormones could thus cross the blood-brain barrier and access the brain where they could influence cognition and mental health. We then summarize studies that assessed the effects of the exogenous administration of glucocorticoids on cognitive performance supported by the hippocampus, the frontal lobes and amygdala. In the second section of the paper, we summarize the effects of the endogenous release of glucocorticoids induced by exposure to a stressful situation on human cognition and we further dissociate the effects of emotion from those of stress on human learning and memory. Finally, in the last section of the paper, we discuss the potential impact that the environmental context to which we expose participants when assessing their memory could have on their reactivity to stress and subsequent cognitive performance. In order to make our point, we discuss the field of memory and aging and we suggest that some of the 'age-related memory impairments' observed in the literature could be partly due to increased stress reactivity in older adults to the environmental context of testing. We also discuss the inverse negative correlations reported between hippocampal volume and memory for young and older adults and suggest that these inverse correlations could be partly due to the effects of contextual stress in young and older adults, as a function of age-related differences in hippocampal volume.

J	Debruille, JB				Debruille, J. Bruno			The N400 potential could index a semantic inhibition	BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Review						event-related potential; N400; distractor; knowledge; integration; activation; inhibition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CONCEPTUAL RELATIONSHIPS; DISCOURSE COMPREHENSION; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; REPETITION; SENTENCES; FREQUENCY; KNOWLEDGE	In this theoretical study, I briefly review some of the first hypotheses as to the functional significance of the N400 potential. I then summarize the view that the amplitude of the N400 is proportional to difficulty and indexes the efforts deployed by the brain to integrate the meaning of a stimulus in its context. While this view accounts for many literature data, its shortcomings are also pointed out. The need for various inhibition processes is then emphasized together with the idea that integration difficulty may vary with the amount of inhibition to be performed. Consequently, I stress the view that N400 amplitude could index inhibition rather than integration. The fact that, when presented with incongruous sentence endings, subjects are aware of the meanings of both the sentence frame and the ending has an important consequence on this N400 inhibition view. It means that disconfirmed contexts are not inhibited in some conditions, such as when incongruency is relevant in the situation. To account for this fact, the inhibition the N400 could index has to start only once this relevance is coded, that is, at or after the activation of situational representations. We then show that the idea that the N400 reflects such a late inhibition process may account for literature data that are difficult to account for by the integration view. Further studies are thus needed to test this inhibition idea. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.	Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Montreal, PQ H4H 1R3, Canada; [Debruille, J.

Characterization of the non-adrenergic/noncholinergic response to perivascular nerve stimulation in the double-perfused mesenteric bed of the mouse	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						CGRP; h alpha CGRP(8-37); neuronal nitric oxide synthase; arterial mesenteric vasculature; mouse model	GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; HYPERPOLARIZING FACTOR; RESISTANCE ARTERIES; VANILLOID RECEPTORS; GUANYLYL CYCLASE; SENSORY NERVES; RAT; INHIBITION; MICE	Background and purpose: Calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP), a capsaicin-sensitive neuromodulator of splanchnic vascular tone in several animal species, remains poorly investigated in mouse models. We therefore assessed whether endogenous CGRP is a non-adrenergic/non-cholinergic (NANC) neuromodulator in the mesenteric vascular bed of the mouse. Experimental approach: Arterial and venous changes in perfusion pressure in response to perivascular nerve stimulation (PNS) were monitored in the mouse mesenteric bed under basal conditions or precontracted with KCl (artery) or U46619 (vein) in circuits pretreated with guanethidine, atropine, indomethacin and prazosin. Arterial responses to NANC were also characterized with a CGRP1 antagonist, H alpha CGRP(8-37). Finally, the PNS-induced release of arterial CGRP was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Key results: H alpha CGRP(8-37) enhanced PNS-induced arterial increases in perfusion pressure under basal tone. PNS-induced stimulation of NANC triggered an h alpha CGRP(8-37) or capsaicin- sensitive reduction in perfusion pressure of the pre-contracted arterial bed only. Chemical removal of the endothelium inhibited PNS- and h alpha CGRP- induced reduction in perfusion pressure in the arterial mesenteric bed. Responses to NANC nerves were reduced by guanylate and adenylate cyclase inhibitors (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ)) and [9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine] (SQ 22 536), respectively. A neuronal NOS inhibitor (7-nitroindazole; 7-NI) also enhanced the response to NANC in vessels from wild-type, eNOS KO but not iNOS KO mice. Finally, PNS enhanced the release of immunoreactive CGRP from the perfused arterial mesenteric bed. Conclusions and implications: Our study demonstrates a role for CGRP in the NANC-dependent reduction in perfusion pressure of the arterial but not venous mesenteric bed of the mouse.

Methods: A MPTF was defined as a clinic that advertised specialized multidisciplinary services for the diagnosis and management of chronic pain and had a minimum of three different health care disciplines (including at least one medical speciality) available and integrated within the facility. The search method was previously described in an accompanying article. Designated investigators were responsible for confirming and supplementing MPTFs from the preliminary list in their respective provinces. Administrative leads at each eligible MPTF were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire on their infrastructure, clinical, research, teaching and administrative activities. Only MPTFs dedicated to pediatric populations were included. Results: Only five centres surveyed had dedicated pediatric MPTFs, all located in major cities in five different provinces. While the median wait time was four weeks, it could be as long as nine months in one MPTF Headache and neuropathic pain were the most commonly treated pain syndromes. All MPTFs included physicians, nurses and psychologists, and used a rehabilitation model that incorporated a wide variety of pharmacological, psychological and physical therapies. All centres provided training for medical and other healthcare professionals, and three of the five centres conducted research. Government funding was the major source of funding for patient services and overhead costs. Conclusions: There are very few pediatric MPTFs in Canada. These facilities exist in five of ten provinces, each within large urban centres. Limited accessibility leads to variable and prolonged wait times for pediatric patients suffering from chronic pain.

J	La, TP; Deschenes, M				La, Thuy Phuong; Deschenes, Marc			Mode of transmission, rather than the hepatitis C virus, as a major determinant of poor interpersonal relationships in patients with chronic hepatitis C	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article						neurocognitive impairment; social function; substance abuse	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; LIVER-DISEASE; INFECTION; FATIGUE; DEPRESSION; IMPAIRMENT; IMPACT; REDUCTION	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) have significant neurocognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether chronic HCV infection impacts on patient marital status, living arrangement and employment. METHODS: The charts of patients with chronic hepatitis C and hepatitis B were reviewed. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) age of the 129 patients with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) was 46 +/- 15 years and that of the 428 patients with HCV was 48 +/- 15 years. Sixty-seven per cent of HBV patients were men, compared with 68% of HCV patients. Eighty per cent of HCV patients were Caucasian, compared with 44% of patients with HBV The main modes of transmission were intravenous drug use (37%) and transfusion of blood products (37%) for HCV, compared with country of origin (76%) for HBV There were no differences in marital status rates between HBV- and HCV-infected patients (HBV - married (73%), single (21%) and divorced (6%); and HCV - married (66%), single (23%) and divorced (10%); P=0.20). HCV patients lived alone more often than HBV patients (HBV - 13%, HCV - 22%; P=0.03). There was no difference in overall employment rate between HCV and HBV patients (81% versus 87%; P=0.15). Though there may not have been overall differences between HCV and HBV marital status and employment status, there were differences in the HCV subgroups. These subgroup differences were discovered in the multivariate analysis; mode of transmission was identified as the only predictor of the patients' marital status and employment status. CONCLUSIONS: The most important determinant of interpersonal relationships was the mode of transmission of the viral hepatitis rather than the type of viral infection: past intravenous drug users had lower level relationships.

These effects are mediated in part by melanopsin-expressing light-sensitive ganglion cells that, in contrast to the classical photopic system that is maximally sensitive to green light (550 nm), is very sensitive to blue light (470-480 nm). At present, there is no evidence that blue light exposure is effective in modulating nonvisual brain activity related to complex cognitive tasks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that, while participants perform an auditory working memory task, a short (18 min) daytime exposure to blue (470 nm) or green (550 nm) monochromatic light (3 x 10(13) photons/cm(2)/s) differentially modulates regional brain responses. Blue light typically enhanced brain responses or at least prevented the decline otherwise observed following green light exposure in frontal and parietal cortices implicated in working memory, and in the thalamus involved in the modulation of cognition by arousal. Our results imply that monochromatic light can affect cognitive functions almost instantaneously and suggest that these effects are mediated by a melanopsin-based photoreceptor system.

While their results may be consistent with this interpretation, they are nonetheless correlational and do not address a parsimonious alternative explanation. This alternative stipulates that FP is a purely spatial, hallucinatory form of a common cognitive phenomenon-social imagery-that is often, but not necessarily, linked with threat and fear and that may induce distress among susceptible individuals. The occurrence of both fearful and non-fearful FPs in a multiplicity of situations other than sleep paralysis attacks supports the notion that FPs are hallucinatory variants of social imagery and that they are not necessarily bound to threat-activated vigilance. Evidence linking FPs with anxiety disorders supports the notion that the distress they evoke may be mediated by a more general affective distress personality factor. To illustrate the predominantly spatial character of FP hallucinations, similarities between FP and phantom limbs are summarized and the possibility that these two phenomena are parallel expressions (self- vs. other-presence) of a mirror neuron system is considered.

This controversy exists regarding the specific interventions used on-scene and en-route to definitive care centers, regarding the overall approach to the care of these patients (advanced life support versus basic life support) and with regards to who should be providing this care. This section of the journal aims to review the most current literature concerning these topics as well as highlight some important and relevant literature preceding it. Recent findings Studies examining overall prehospital care in terms of morbidity, mortality and cost have been published over the last year and important points from these studies are highlighted in the text, Unfortunately, there have not been any recent, appropriately powered, prospective studies that help in clarifying this controversy. An international study of prehospital care has recently been completed and is summarized. Recent studies looking at specific aspects of prehospital care (endotracheal intubation, intravenous access and therapy, rural trauma) are also outlined in the text. Summary There is no convincing evidence that prehospital advanced life support in the urban setting provides any benefit to injured patients in terms of either morbidity or mortality.

DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							EARLY INFANTILE AUTISM; MOTION PERCEPTION; REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS; DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS; DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; VISUAL-SEARCH; FOLLOW-UP; INDIVIDUALS; FREQUENCY	Autistic adults display enhanced and locally oriented low-level perception of static visual information, but diminished perception of some types of movement. The identification of potential precursors, such as atypical perceptual processing, among very young children would be an initial step toward understanding the development of these phenomena. The purpose of this study was to provide an initial measure and interpretation of atypical visual exploratory behaviors toward inanimate objects (AVEBIOs) among young children with autism. A coding system for AVEBIOs was constructed from a corpus of 40 semi standardized assessments of autistic children. The most frequent atypical visual behavior among 15 children aged 33-73 months was lateral glance that was mostly oriented toward moving stimuli and was detected reliably by the experimenters (intraclass correlation >.90). This behavior was more common among autistic than typically developing children of similar verbal mental age and chronological age. As lateral vision is associated with the filtering of high spatial frequency (detail perception) information and the facilitation of high temporal frequencies (movement perception), its high prevalence among very young autistic children may reflect early attempts to regulate and/or optimize both excessive amounts of local information and diminished perception of movement. These findings are initial evidence for the need to consider the neural bases and development of atypical behaviors and their implications for intervention strategies.

In the current studies, we first demonstrated that chronic infusions of PRL into the lateral ventricles increased food intake in cycling rats without disrupting estrous cyclicity. In subsequent experiments the hypothesis that at least part of PRL's ability to increase food intake resulted from PRL-induced leptin resistance was tested. Female rats given chronic infusions of PRL (5 mu g/h) into the cerebral ventricles for 10 d did not show a reduction in food intake or body weight after a central injection of 4 mu g murine leptin, whereas the expected reduction in both of these parameters was seen in vehicle-infused rats. Leptin injections were without effect on these parameters, whether they were administered to free feeding PRL-infused rats or after 24-h food deprivation. This lack of a behavioral response to leptin was accompanied by an attenuation in Fos induction and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 after leptin administration in PRL-infused rats in both the ventromedial hypothalamus and paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus.

Netrins are guidance cues involved in the proper organization of neuronal connectivity during development. We have hypothesized that variations in the function of DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), a netrin-1 receptor highly expressed by DA neurones, may result in altered development and organization of mesocorticolimbic DA circuitry, and influence DA function in the adult. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of reduced DCC on several indicators of DA function. Using in-vivo microdialysis, we showed that adult mice that develop with reduced DCC display increased basal DA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and exaggerated DA release in response to the indirect DA agonist amphetamine. In contrast, these mice exhibit normal levels of DA in the nucleus accumbens but significantly blunted amphetamine-induced DA release. Concomitantly, using conditioned place preference, locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition paradigms, we found that reduced DCC diminishes the rewarding and behavioural-activating effects of amphetamine and protects against amphetamine-induced deficits in sensorimotor gating. Furthermore, we found that adult DCC-deficient mice exhibit altered dendritic spine density in layer V medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurones but not in nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurones. These findings demonstrate that reduced DCC during development results in a behavioural phenotype opposite to that observed in developmental models of schizophrenia and identify DCC as a critical factor in the development of DA function.

This study focuses on whether ageing and cognitive status correlates with relative numbers of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic boutons. We investigated the density of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic inputs across several areas of the rat cerebral cortex in young and aged male Fischer 344 rats. Aged animals were segregated into aged cognitively impaired (AI) and aged cognitively unimpaired (AU) groups using the Morris water maze. We applied immunohistochemistry to reveal the majority of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic boutons captured with confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. A gradual decline in the density of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic boutons occurred from young to AU to AI animals; however, the ratios of excitatory to inhibitory presynaptic bouton densities were not significantly altered. We further investigated the density of receptor scaffolding proteins representing key excitatory and inhibitory receptor postsynaptic sites, using antibodies against specific markers of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic densities, respectively. Significant changes in the ratios of excitatory to inhibitory postsynaptic densities were observed only in AI compared to young rats.	[Majdi, Maryam; Ribeiro-da-Silva, Alfredo; Cuello, A.

Neurotrophin deprivation induces death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in such cases, but this is probably not the only mechanism that causes their death. Various fluorophores and agents that block mitochondrial electron transport have been used to show that superoxide generated in the mitochondrial electron transport chain could act, in addition to neurotrophin deprivation, to signal cell death after axonal injury. More specifically, sulphydryls-probably on proteins-are downstream regulators of this signalling pathway, as shown by the neuroprotective effects of inhibition of sulphydryl oxidation by tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine in in vivo rat models. Other tools used to study early events in RGC death include novel reducing agents, inducible superoxide dismutase, and differentiation of the RGC-5 cell line.	[Lieven, C. J.; Levin, L.

The primary region of damage is thought to be the optic nerve head (ONH), with the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and optic radiations to the visual cortex being secondarily affected. Neurotrophin deprivation resulting from optic nerve injury is thought to cause RGCs to die by apoptosis by inhibition of cell survival pathways. However, disruption of retrograde axonal transport is not the only mechanism associated with optic nerve damage and RGC death, and thus, an additional mechanism of injury is likely to be involved in glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

Functional consequences of S1P receptor modulation in rat oligodendroglial lineage cells	GLIA			English	Article						glial cells; FTY720; myelination; oligodendrocytes; PDGF; sphingosine-1-phosphate	SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE RECEPTOR; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; IMMUNOMODULATORY DRUG FTY720; MULTIPLE SIGNALING PATHWAYS; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; PROGENITOR CELLS; SPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATE RECEPTORS; VASCULAR MATURATION; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; KINASE ACTIVATION	Fingolimod (FTY720) and its phosphorylated form FTY720P are modulators of sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP) receptors , which are G-protein coupled receptors linked to cell migration and vascular maturation. The efficacy of FTY720 in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and its animal models has been attributed to its inhibition of lymphocyte trafficking to target organs. In this study, we examined the role of SIP receptors in cultured rat oligodendrocytes (OLGs) and OLG progenitor cells (OPCs) using the active phosphorylated form of FTY720. We found that (1) FTY720P improves the survival of neonatal rat OLGs during serum withdrawal, which is associated with the phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and Akt; (2) FTY720P regulates OPC differentiation into OLGs in a concentration-dependent manner; and (3) SIP receptors are differentially modulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) resulting in downregulation of S1P5 and upregulation of S1P1 in OPCs. In addition, siRNA studies revealed that S1P1 participates in PDGF-induced OPC mitogenesis. We conclude that S1P1 and SIP5 serve different functions during oligodendroglial development, and possibly during remyelination. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The aim of the current study was to characterize the correlation between TEA and postoperative resource use or outcome in a consecutive- patient cohort. The study was performed in a tertiary care, 3-surgeon, university-affiliated hospital that performs 350 to 400 cardiac surgeries per year. All 1293 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery between July 1, 2002, and February 1, 2006, were included. Patients were assigned to anesthesiologists practicing TEA (TEA group, n=506) or not (control group, n=787) for cardiac surgery. The preoperative parameter values and Parsonnet scores for the 2 groups were similar. The 2 groups had the same distribution of surgery types. The TEA group presented with fewer intensive care unit (ICU) complications, such as delirium, pneumonia, and acute renal failure, and presented with better myocardial protection. The TEA group presented with a higher proportion of immediately postoperative extubations and with shorter ventilation times and ICU stays. Total ICU costs decreased from US $18,700 to $9900 per patient. Combining TEA and general anesthesia for cardiac surgery allows a significant change in anesthesia strategy. This change improves immediate postoperative outcomes and reduces the use and costs of ICU resources.

The main component of the system is a bio-electronic device to be implanted inside the skull of the user, composed of a plurality of stimulation modules, whose actions are controlled via an interface module. Power and data are transmitted to the implant wirelessly through a bidirectional inductive link, allowing diagnosis of the stimulating device and its environment after implantation, as well as power delivery optimization. A high level of flexibility is supported in terms of stimulation parameters, but a configurable communication protocol allows the device to be used with maximum efficiency. The core of an external controller implemented in a system on a programmable chip is also presented, performing data conversion and timing management such that phosphene intensity can be modulated by any parameter defining stimulation, either at the pulse level or in the time domain. Measured performances achieved with a prototype using two types of custom ASICs implemented in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process and commercial components fulfill the requirements for a complete visual prosthesis for humans. When on/off activation is used with predefined parameters, stimuli measured on an electronic test bench could attain a rate in excess of 500 k pulses/s.

Rachid			Association between road vehicle collisions and recent medical contact in older drivers: a case-crossover study	INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article							DRIVING ABILITY; FATAL CRASHES; BRAIN-INJURY; DEMENTIA; RISK; CONSEQUENCES; DESIGN; TRENDS; IMPACT; SAFETY	Objective: To estimate the association between past medical contacts and the risk of vehicle collision in a population of older drivers from the province of Quebec, Canada. Design: Case-crossover study. Setting: Quebec. Participants: 111 699 older drivers involved in at least one vehicle collision between January 1988 and December 2000. Main outcome measures: For each driver, the risk of having a vehicle collision while exposed and not exposed to a medical contact was compared. Separate conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted for all drivers and in four diagnostic-specific subgroups. Results: The study found a weak but statistically significant increased risk of all collisions being associated with a medical contact within 1 month before the collision, for all drivers (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.11) and for drivers with diabetes (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11). Conclusion: Older drivers who have a collision are more likely to have been in contact with a physician shortly before the collision. These findings suggest that there might be an opportunity to detect medical conditions that put older drivers at higher risk of collision; however, further research is needed to assess the potential effectiveness and practical modalities of screening.

Methods and Materials: The DVHs of 57 patients with NPC with IMRT with or without chemotherapy were reviewed. Thirty-one patients underwent IP IMRT, and 26 patients underwent FP IMRT. Treatment goals were to prescribe a minimum dose of 66-70 Gy for gross tumor volume and 59.4 Gy for planning target volume to greater than 95% of the volume. Multiple selected end points were used to compare dose-volume histograms of the targets, including minimum, mean, and maximum doses; percentage of target volume receiving less than 90% (1-V90%), less than 95% (1-V95%), and greater than 105% (1-V105%). Dose-volume histograms of organs at risk were evaluated with characteristic end points. Results: Both planning methods provided excellent target coverage with no statistically significant differences found, although a trend was suggested in favor of improved target coverage with IP IMRT in patients with T3/ T4 NPC (p = 0.10). Overall, IP IMRT statistically decreased the dose to the parotid gland, temporomandibular joint, brain stem, and spinal cord overall, whereas IP led to a dose decrease to the middle/inner ear in only the T1/T2 subgroup. Conclusions: Use of IP and FP IMRT can lead to good target coverage while maintaining critical structures within tolerance. The IP IMRT selectively spared these critical organs to a greater degree and should be considered the standard of treatment in patients with NPC, particularly those with T3/T4. The FP IMRT is an effective second option in centers with limited IP IMRT capacity. As a modification of conformal techniques, the human/departmental resources to incorporate FP-IMRT should be nominal. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Effects of inflammation on the ultrastructural localization of spinal cord dorsal horn group I metabotropic glutamate receptors	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						nociception; hyperalgesia; inflammation; metabotropic glutamate receptors; trafficking	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; UP-REGULATION; NEURONAL PLASTICITY; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; SUPERFICIAL LAMINAE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CENTRAL MODULATION; CLINICAL-MODEL; RAT	Inflammatory pain is thought to induce functional plasticity of spinal dorsal horn neurons and may produce changes in glutamate receptor expression. Plasticity of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) is important in various neuronal systems, and these receptors are also known to modulate nociceptive neurotransmission in the spinal dorsal horn. The present study aimed at determining whether persistent inflammatory pain produces alterations in intracellular and plasma membrane-associated mGluR1 alpha and mGluR5 in spinal cord dorsal horn. Persistent inflammation was induced in male Long Evans rats by a unilateral intraplantar injection of 100 mu L of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Three days after the CFA injection thermal withdrawal latencies were obtained prior to processing of transverse spinal cord sections for preembedding immunogold labeling after incubation in primary antibody for mGluR1 alpha or mGluR5. Using electron microscopy, we quantified immunogold-labeled mGluR1 alpha and mGluR5 profiles, located in lamina V and I-II, respectively, of both CFA-treated rats and untreated control rats. Compared to untreated rats, CFA-treated rats had a significant increase in the number of plasma membrane-associated mGluR5 immunogold-labeled particles in lamina I-II neurons of the spinal cord. Although no changes to mGluR1 alpha expression were found in CFA-treated rats, plasma membrane-associated mGluR1 alpha was significantly closer to the synapse. Therefore, in CFA-treated rats there was a specific increase in the ratio of plasma membrane-associated versus intracellular immunogold-labeled particles for mGluR5, and lateral movement of mGluR1 alpha toward the synapse, indicating that peripheral inflammation-induced trafficking of group I mGluRs in spinal dorsal horn neurons may be an important factor in the development of plastic changes associated with inflammation-induced chronic pain.

It is thus plausible to assume that neural systems have developed mechanisms to reduce this noise. Theoretical studies have shown that threshold fatigue (i.e. cumulative increases in the threshold during repetitive firing) could lead to noise reduction at certain frequencies bands and thus improved signal transmission as well as noise increases and decreased signal transmission at other frequencies: a phenomenon called noise shaping. There is, however, no experimental evidence that threshold fatigue actually occurs and, if so, that it will actually lead to noise shaping. We analyzed action potential threshold variability in intracellular recordings in vivo from pyramidal neurons in weakly electric fish and found experimental evidence for threshold fatigue: an increase in instantaneous firing rate was on average accompanied by an increase in action potential threshold. We show that, with a minor modification, the standard Hodgkin-Huxley model can reproduce this phenomenon. We next compared the performance of models with and without threshold fatigue. Our results show that threshold fatigue will lead to a more regular spike train as well as robustness to intrinsic noise via noise shaping. We finally show that the increased/reduced noise levels due to threshold fatigue correspond to decreased/increased information transmission at different frequencies.

Real-time PCR showed increased XIAP expression in blood of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, correlating with disease severity. Daily administration (10 mg/kg/day i.p.) of a 19-mer antisense oligonucleotide specific for XIAP (ASO-XIAP) abolished disease-associated XIAP mRNA and protein expression, and given from day of onset, alleviated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and prevented relapses. Prophylactic treatment also reduced XIAP expression and prevented disease. Random or 5-base mismatched ASO was not inhibitory, and ASO-XIAP did not affect T cell priming. In ASOXIAP-treated animals, infiltrating cells and inflammatory foci were dramatically reduced within the CNS. Flow cytometry showed an 88-93% reduction in T cells. The proportion of TUNEL+ apoptotic CD4(+) T cells in the CNS was increased from <1.6 to 26% in ASO-XIAP-treated mice, and the proportion of Annexin V-positive CD4(+) T cells in the CNS increased. Neurons and oligodendrocytes were not affected; neither did apoptosis increase in liver, where XIAP knockdown also occurred. ASO-XIAP increased susceptibility of T cells to activation-induced apoptosis in vitro. Our results identify XIAP as a critical controller of apoptotic susceptibility of effector T cell function.

The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of using brain-based measures of emotion (i.e. regional EEG asymmetry measures) with children with Down syndrome, and whether children with Down syndrome exhibit patterns of frontal brain activity during the processing of affective stimuli that are not different from typically developing children, but of lesser magnitude. Methods Regional brain electrical activity (EEG) was measured in response to the presentation of popular children's video clips that varied in affective content in three children with Down syndrome and three typically developing children who were matched on reading level. Results The children with Down syndrome appeared to show a similar pattern of frontal EEG asymmetry as the typically developing children for the video clips depicting happiness, sadness and fear. However, the magnitude of the frontal asymmetry scores for the children with Down syndrome was large across the affective stimuli, and they appeared to process the video clip depicting anger differently from the typically developing children. Conclusion This preliminary evidence suggests that brain- based measures of affective processing can be used to study the differentiation of emotion on an electrocortical level among children with Down syndrome.study the differentiation of emotion on an electrocortical level among children with Down syndrome.

More specifically, mouse Hes6 regulates cerebral corticogenesis by promoting neurogenesis and suppressing astrocyte differentiation. The molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-astrogenic function of Hes6 are poorly defined. Here we describe studies aimed at testing whether Hes6 inhibits astrocyte differentiation by antagonizing the transcription repression activity of Notch-activated Hes family members like Hes1. It is reported that Hes6 preferentially forms homodimers. Heterodimerization with Hes1 is antagonized in part by a conserved N-terminal patch of negatively charged residues. Mutation of this motif enhances heterodimerization with Hes1 and increases Hes6 ability to antagonize Hes1-mediated transcriptional repression. However, this mutation does not increase, but instead decreases, the anti-astrogenic activity of Hes6. It is shown further that Hes6 harbors a second conserved sequence, a C-terminal SPXXSP motif. This sequence is phosphorylated by the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway and its mutation disrupts the anti-astrogenic activity of Hes6 without affecting its ability to suppress Hes1. Together, these observations suggest that Hes6 homodimers regulate astrocyte differentiation through mechanisms that depend on the phosphorylation of Hes6 C-terminal domain but are independent of its ability to suppress Hes1-mediated transcriptional repression.

Modifiability of generalization in dynamics learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CORIOLIS-FORCE PERTURBATIONS; REACHING MOVEMENTS; INTERLIMB TRANSFER; INTERNAL-MODEL; ARM; ADAPTATION; REPRESENTATION; TRANSFORMATION; KINEMATICS; MEMORY	Modifiability of generalization in dynamics learning. J Neurophysiol 98: 3321-3329, 2007. First published October 10, 2007; doi:10.1152/jn.00576.2007. Studies on plasticity in motor function have shown that motor learning generalizes, such that movements in novel situations are affected by previous training. It has been shown that the pattern of generalization for visuomotor rotation learning changes when training movements are made to a wide distribution of directions. Here we have found that for dynamics learning, the shape of the generalization gradient is not similarly modifiable by the extent of training within the workspace. Subjects learned to control a robotic device during training and we measured how subsequent movements in a reference direction were affected. Our results show that as the angular separation between training and test directions increased, the extent of generalization was reduced. When training involved multiple targets throughout the workspace, the extent of generalization was no greater than following training to the nearest target alone. Thus a wide range of experience compensating for a dynamics perturbation provided no greater benefit than localized training. Instead, generalization was complete when training involved targets that bounded the reference direction. This suggests that broad generalization of dynamics learning to movements in novel directions depends on interpolation between instances of localized learning.	[Mattar, Andrew A.

This study sought to assess their impact. Methods: Retrospective review of all patients referred to the Skull Base Clinic of the McGill University Health Centre since 2000. Patients were operated on in a multidisciplinary context using a multimodal approach combining endoscopy and microscopy. Imaging during the surgery was initially supported by both three-dimensional neuronavigation and traditional C-arm fluoroscopy. Results: Seventy-five patients were referred to the multidisciplinary clinic, for a total of 41 surgeries. Neuronavigation was used in all cases. C-arm fluoroscopy was not found to improve our surgeries and was removed from our protocol. Endoscopy was found to be advantageous as it allowed improved visualization. It also permitted identifying surrounding structures in the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus, next to the tumour, and "around corners." Moreover, it encouraged multidisciplinary co-operation as it allowed neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists to follow progress during the case. Nevertheless, the microscope continued to play a role as it facilitated a bimanual technique, stable magnification, and a three-dimensional view. Morbidities in our case series appeared to be minimal. Conclusion: Both endoscopy and the microscope were found to have a role in our surgeries. We consider these technologies to be complementary. C-arm fluoroscopy was rendered obsolete by the neuronavigation unit. A multidisciplinary, multimodal approach maximizes the benefits of these new technologies and permits the best surgical result.

Maternal separation leads to persistent reductions in pain sensitivity in female rats	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						hot plate; opioid; neonatal handling; morphine; maternal separation	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; MU-OPIOID RECEPTOR; LONG-EVANS RATS; MORPHINE-INDUCED ANALGESIA; EARLY NEONATAL EXPERIENCE; MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA; OF-THE-LITERATURE; OPIATE RECEPTOR; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; REARING CONDITIONS	We determined responses to noxious thermal stimuli, before and after morphine, and mu-opioid receptor binding in brain regions involved in nociception in maternally separated (MS), neonatally handled (H) and nonhandled (NH) female rats. Long-Evans dams were randomly assigned to either 180-minute (MS) or 15-minute (H) minute daily separations from their litters or left undisturbed (NH). At 120 days of age, paw lick latency (50 C hot plate) was determined in offspring during diestrous. Rats were then given 1, 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg morphine and paw lick latency was measured. Rats were killed during diestrous and mu-opioid receptor binding was determined in discrete brain regions, using [H-3]DAMGO autoradiography. MS rats had significantly longer (P <.05) paw lick latencies compared with H rats. The percent maximal possible effect of morphine was significantly (P <.05) lower in MS compared with H rats for the 5 mg/kg dose. it-Opioid receptor binding capacity was significantly greater (P <.05) in MS rats compared with H rats in the medial preoptic nucleus. In conclusion, MS and H treatments led to antipodal differences in pain sensitivity in female rats and differential l-opioid receptor binding in the medial preoptic nucleus. Perspective: This article describes the persistent impact of early life adversity on pain sensitivity and the analgesic potency of morphine. Clinically, early life history may play an important role in pain symptoms and responses to opioid analgesics. (c) 2007 by the American Pain Society.

To follow the natural evolution of dietary and nutrition status among elderly community-dwelling adults with Alzheimer dementia. Methods With their caregivers, 36 community-dwelling patients in early stages of Alzheimer dementia, aged >= 65 years, were recruited from memory clinics in Montreal, age-matched to cognitively intact community-based controls (n=58), and interviewed at four to five time points (T0 to T4) across an 18-month period. Current diet and supplement use were assessed monthly by two food records and/or 24-hour diet recalls (666 records/recalls from patients and 1,678 records/recalls from controls), using adapted data collection techniques among patients, and analyzed using CANDAT with the 2001b Canadian Nutrient File. Results Nutrient intakes from diet and supplements were higher in control subjects, with significant differences in energy, the macronutrients, calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin K, vitamin A, and dietary fiber as well as n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. Repeated measures analysis of variance confirmed these observations among balanced groups of participants aged >= 70 years with full nutrient data during 12 months' follow-up. Conclusions Dietary intakes by persons with Alzheimer dementia are poor compared to cognitively intact age-matched controls. Suboptimal diet is evident early in the onset of the disease. This vulnerable population would benefit from systematic dietary assessment and intervention to prevent further deterioration in food consumption and increased nutritional risk.

Activation detection in diffuse optical imaging by means of the general linear model	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						diffuse optical imaging; DOI; general linear model; GLM; activation detection	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; FMRI TIME-SERIES; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; MAYER WAVES; BOLD; MOTOR; BRAIN; HUMANS; REORGANIZATION	Due to its non-invasive nature and low cost, diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is becoming a commonly used technique to assess functional activation in the brain. When imaging with DOI, two major issues arise in the data analysis: (i) the separation of noise of physiological origin and the recovery of the functional response; (ii) the tomographic image reconstruction problem. This paper focuses on the first issue. Although the general linear model (GLM) has been extensively used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), DOI has mostly relied on filtering and averaging of raw data to recover brain functional activation. This is mainly due to the high temporal resolution of DOI which implies a new design of the drift basis modelling physiology. In this paper, we provide (i) a filtering method based on cosine functions that is more adapted than standard averaging techniques for DOI specifically; (ii) a new mode-locking technique to recover small signals and locate them temporally with high precision (shift method). Results on real data show the capability of the shift method to retrieve HbR and HbO(2) peak locations. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The algorithm uses vessel centerlines extracted from segmented pre-operative MRA data and intra-operative power Doppler ultrasound images to compute first a linear fit and then a thin-plate spline transform in order to achieve non-linear registration. The method was validated using (i) homologous landmarks identified in the original data, (ii) selected vessels, excluded from the fitting procedure and (iii) manually segmented, non-vascular structures. The tracking of homologous landmarks show that we are able to correct the deformation to within 1.25 mm, and the validation using excluded vessels and anatomical structures show an accuracy of I mm. Preprocessing of the data can be completed in 30 s per dataset, and registrations can be performed in less than 30 s. This makes the technique well suited for intra-operative use.

Controversy exists about the role of glutamine accumulation as a causal factor in HE. Glutamine formation contributes to detoxify ammonia, whereby anaplerotic mechanisms in the astrocytes have to be sufficient to replenish Krebs cycle intermediates. The application of ex vivo high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy permits direct measurements of metabolites and different metabolic pathways. Ex vivo(13)C-NMR studies in experimental animal models of acute and chronic HE have provided new insights. In an experimental rat model of ALF, C-13 isotopomer analysis of glucose metabolism showed that alterations of glucose flux through astrocytic pyruvate carboxylase might be linked to the pathogenesis of ALF as a limited anaplerotic flux in the brain, but not in the muscle, correlates with the development of brain edema. Moreover, C-13-NMR data from a rat model of mild HE demonstrated relative differences in the pathway of glucose through pyruvate carboxylase in thalamus compared to frontal cortex, which might explain the vulnerability of this brain region compared to thalamus. These findings further support that glutamine accumulation might be not the primary cause of neurological symptoms in HE, and show that anaplerotic mechanisms could be essential for ammonia detoxification in HE.

Alterations of astrocytic-neuronal cross talk occurs affecting brain function. In acute liver failure, astrocyte undergo swelling, which results in increased intracranial pressure and may lead to brain herniation. In chronic liver failure, Alzheimer-type II astrocytosis is a characteristic change. Neurosteroids (NS) synthesized in the brain mainly by astrocytes independent of peripheral steroidal sources (adrenals and gonads) are suggested to play a role in HE. NS bind and modulate different types of membrane receptors. Effects on the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor complex are the most extensively studied. For example, the NS tetrahydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone), and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) are potent positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors. As a consequence of modulation of these receptors, NS are well-known to modulate inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Some NS bind to intracellular receptors, and in this way may also regulate gene expression. In HE, it has been well documented that neurotransmission and gene expression alterations occur during the progression of the disease. This review summarizes findings of relevance for the involvement of NS in human and experimental HE.

However, contrary to this assumption, neuronal cell damage and death are well documented in liver failure patients, taking the form of several distinct clinical entities namely acquired (non-Wilsonian) hepatocerebral degeneration, cirrhosis-related Parkinsonism, post-shunt myelopathy and cerebellar degeneration. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that liver failure contributes to the severity of neuronal loss in Wernicke's encephalopathy. The long-standing nature of the thalamic and cerebellar lesions, over 80% of which are missed by routine clinical evaluation, together with the probability that they are nutritional in origin, underscores the need for careful nutritional management (adequate dietary protein, Vitamin B-1) in liver failure patients. Mechanisms identified with the potential to cause neuronal cell death in liver failure include NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, lactic acidosis, oxidative/nitrosative stress and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The extent of neuronal damage in liver failure may be attenuated by compensatory mechanisms that include down-regulation of NMDA receptors, hypothermia and the presence of neuroprotective steroids such as allopregnanolone. These findings suggest that some of the purported "sequelae" of liver transplantation (gait ataxia, memory loss, confusion) could reflect preexisting neuropathology.

Photic injury promotes cleavage of p75NTR by TACE and nuclear trafficking of the p75 intracellular domain	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						p75 neurotrophin receptor; p751CD; p75NTR; Intracellular domain; tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme; photic injury; apoptosis; photoreceptor cells	NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR P75; CELL-DEATH; CONVERTING-ENZYME; PHOTORECEPTOR CELLS; TRANSGENIC MICE; TRUNCATED FORM; LIGHT HISTORY; NGF RECEPTOR	The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that paradoxically mediates neuronal survival and differentiation or apoptotic cell death. Cleavage of p75NTR by a constitutively active metalloprotease could result in shedding of its extracellular domain (p75ECD) and generation of a proapoptotic intracellular domain (p751CD). In this study, we established that exposure of a transgenic mouse photoreceptor cell line to intense light upregulated the expression of p75NTR and of the disintegrin metalloprotease tumor necrosis factor-converting enzyme (TACE) and resulted in apoptotic cell death. Light damage promoted TACE cleavage of p75NTR resulting in shedding of the soluble p75ECD and nuclear translocation of the p751CD. Overexpression of TACE and p75NTR-induced p75NTR cleavage and secretion of p75ECD, but not nuclear transport of p751CD. Light-induced cleavage of p75NTR, nuclear localization of p751CD, and apoptosis were inhibited by IC-3, a metalloprotease inhibitor. Increased levels of p75NTR and TACE were observed in photoreceptor cells of animals with photic injury. Our findings support a role for TACE in the proteolytic cleavage of p75NTR and light-induced apoptosis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Tong, XK; Hamel, E				Tong, Xin-Kang; Hamel, Edith			Transforming growth factor-beta 1 impairs endothelin-1-mediated contraction of brain vessels by inducing mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1 and inhibiting p38 MAP kinase	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; EXPRESSION; RECEPTORS; PATHWAY	Brain levels of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are increased in Alzheimer's disease and have been implicated in the associated cerebrovascular pathology. We recently reported that transgenic mice that overexpress TGF-beta 1 (TGF(+) mice) display, with aging, selectively reduced endothelin-1 (ET-1)-mediated contractions. Because ET-1 is a key regulator of cerebrovascular tone and homeostasis, we investigated how increased levels of TGF-beta 1 could selectively alter this contractile response. We found that ETA receptors, via activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, mediate the ET-1- induced contraction in mouse cerebral arteries, a response significantly decreased in aged TGF(+) mice (-39%; p < 0.01) despite unaltered ETA receptor levels or affinity. In cerebrovascular smooth muscle cell cultures, long-term treatment with TGF-beta 1 significantly decreased (>50%; p < 0.05) the ET-1-induced activation of the p38 MAPK/27-kDa heat shock protein (HSP27) signaling pathway. This occurred with no effect upstream to p38 MAP kinase but with the concomitant induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) expression. Inhibition of MKP-1 expression with Ro-31-8220 or suppression of MKP-1 expression by short interfering RNA restored the ET-1-mediated p38 MAP kinase response. These results disclose a new role for long-term increases of TGF-beta 1 in modulating cerebrovascular tone by dampening ET-1-mediated activation of the p38 MAPK/HSP27 signaling pathway. Such changes in ET-1-mediated signaling may help maintain vascular wall homeostasis by compensating for the diminished dilatory function induced by TGF-beta 1 and amyloid-beta; brain levels of these two molecules are increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

LRRTM1 on chromosome 2p12 is a maternally suppressed gene that is associated paternally with handedness and schizophrenia	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						handedness; schizophrenia; association; imprinted gene; brain asymmetry	RELATIVE HAND SKILL; ACCELERATED EVOLUTION; CEREBRAL ASYMMETRY; CANDIDATE GENE; SIBLING PAIRS; LANGUAGE; LINKAGE; BRAIN; EXPRESSION; FAMILIES	Left-right asymmetrical brain function underlies much of human cognition, behavior and emotion. Abnormalities of cerebral asymmetry are associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The molecular, developmental and evolutionary origins of human brain asymmetry are unknown. We found significant association of a haplotype upstream of the gene LRRTM1 (Leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 1) with a quantitative measure of human handedness in a set of dyslexic siblings, when the haplotype was inherited paternally (P = 0.00002). While we were unable to find this effect in an epidemiological set of twin-based sibships, we did find that the same haplotype is overtransmitted paternally to individuals with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder in a study of 1002 affected families (P= 0.0014). We then found direct confirmatory evidence that LRRTM1 is an imprinted gene in humans that shows a variable pattern of maternal downregulation. We also showed that LRRTM1 is expressed during the development of specific forebrain structures, and thus could influence neuronal differentiation and connectivity. This is the first potential genetic influence on human handedness to be identified, and the first putative genetic effect on variability in human brain asymmetry. LRRTM1 is a candidate gene for involvement in several common neurodevelopmental disorders, and may have played a role in human cognitive and behavioral evolution.

The main focus of this article is to operationalize the diagnosis of PD-D and to propose pratical guidelines based on a two level process depending upon the clinical scenario and the expertise of the evaluator involved in the assessment. Level I is aimed primarily at the clinician with no particular expertise in neuropsychological methods, but who requires a simple, pragmatic set of tests that are not excessively time-consuming. Level I can be used alone or in concert with Level 11, which is more suitable when there is the need to specify the pattern and the severity on the dementia of PD-D for clinical monitoring, research studies or pharmacological trials. Level 11 tests can also be proposed when the diagnosis of PD-D remains uncertain or equivocal at the end of a Level I evaluation. Given the lack of evidence-based standards for some tests when applied in this clinical context, we have tried to make practical and unambiguous recommendations, based upon the available literature and the collective experience of the Task Force. We accept, however, that further validation of certain tests and modifications in the recommended cut off values will be required through future studies.

Here we show that polysialic acid (PSA), presented by the neural cell adhesion molecule, has a role in the maturation of GABAergic innervation and ocular dominance plasticity. Concentrations of PSA significantly decline shortly after eye opening in the adolescent mouse visual cortex; this decline is hindered by visual deprivation. The developmental and activity-dependent regulation of PSA expression is inversely correlated with the maturation of GABAergic innervation. Premature removal of PSA in visual cortex results in precocious maturation of perisomatic innervation by basket interneurons, enhanced inhibitory synaptic transmission, and earlier onset of ocular dominance plasticity. The developmental and activity-dependent decline of PSA expression therefore regulates the timing of the maturation of GABAergic inhibition and the onset of ocular dominance plasticity.

Blood mononuclear cell (BMC) transcriptomes of sporadic AD subjects and aged-matched normal elderly controls (NEC) were compared using the human NIA microarray. Relative to the NEC samples, the Alzheimer BMC exhibited a significant decline in the expression of genes concerned with cytoskeletal maintenance, cellular trafficking, cellular stress response, redox homeostasis, transcription and DNA repair. We observed decreased expression of several genes which may impact amyloid-beta production and the processing of the microtubule-associated protein tau. The microarray results were validated by quantitative real time PCR and revealed gender differences in the levels of altered gene expression. Our findings attest to the systemic nature of gene dys-regulation in sporadic AD, implicate disruption of cytoskeletal integrity, DNA repair mechanisms and cellular defenses in this condition, and suggest novel pathways of (beta-amyloid deposition in this disease. BMC are highly accessible and may reflect molecular events germane to the neuropathophysiology of AD. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Tohyama, Y; Muck-Seler, D; Diksic, M				Tohyama, Yoshihiro; Mueck-Seler, Dorotea; Diksic, Mirko			Acute fiesinoxan treatment produces a different effect on rat brain serotonin synthesis than chronic treatment: An alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan autoradiographic study	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan; serotonin synthesis rate; 5-HT1A agonist; flesinoxan; autoradiography	5-HT1A RECEPTOR AGONIST; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DORSAL RAPHE; IN-VIVO; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE RELEASE; SYNTHESIS INVIVO; LUMPED CONSTANT; FLESINOXAN; NEUROTRANSMISSION; RESPONSES	5-HT1A receptor agonists display anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties in clinical studies. In this study, we used the alpha-[C-14]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) autoradiographic method to evaluate the effects of the 5-HT1A agonist, flesinoxan, on regional 5-HT synthesis in the rat brain, following acute or a 14-day continuous treatment. In the first series of experiments, flesinoxan (5 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered 40 min before the (alpha-MTrp. It resulted in a significant increase of the arterial blood oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) and a reduction of the regional rate of 5-HT synthesis throughout the brain, with the exception of a few regions (medial geniculate body and thalamus). In the second series of experiments, flesinoxan (5 mg/kg day) was administered for 14 days, using an osmotic minipump implanted subcutaneously. When compared to rats treated with saline, there was an overall significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the synthesis (one-sample two-tailed t-test). However, there was no significant influence on the 5-HT synthesis rate in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei and the majority of their projection areas. A significant (p < 0.05) reduction was observed in the nucleus raphe magnus, medial caudate, ventral thalamus, amygdala, ventral tegmental area, medial forebrain bundle, nucleus accumbens, medial anterior olfactory nucleus and superior olive. The unaltered 5-HT synthesis rates in a large majority of regions following the 14-day treatment of flesinoxan may reflect the normalization (implies to not be different from salne treated control) of synthesis due to a desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors on the cell body of 5-HT neurons as well as at postsynaptic sites, which is known to occur following long-term treatment with 5-HT1A agonists. It is of some importance to note that the normalization of the synthesis occurred in the majority of the brain limbic structures, the brain areas implicated in affective disorders and the corresponding successful treatments, as well as in the cortical regions, which are implicated in mood. However, there were some terminal regions (e.g., accumbens, anterior olfactory, lateral thalamus, raphe magnus and obscurus) in which the chronic flesinoxan treatment resulted in a significant reduction of synthesis, suggesting that there was not a full desensitization across the brain of the receptors controlling 5-HT synthesis.

Involvement of kinin B-1 receptor and oxidative stress in sensory abnormalities and arterial hypertension in an experimental rat model of insulin resistance	NEUROPEPTIDES			English	Article						bradykinin; B-1 receptor; diabetes mellitus; insulin resistance; allodynia; neuropathy; arterial hypertension; oxidative stress; alpha-lipoic acid	ALPHA-LIPOIC ACID; STREPTOZOTOCIN-DIABETIC RATS; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; EARLY UP-REGULATION; SPINAL-CORD; BRADYKININ B-1; BINDING SITES; SUPEROXIDE-PRODUCTION; GENE-EXPRESSION; COLD ALLODYNIA	Diabetes Mellitus leads to pain neuropathy and cardiovascular complications which remain resistant to current therapies involving the control of glycaemia. This study aims at defining the contribution of kinin B-1 receptor (B1R) and the oxidative stress on sensory abnormalities and arterial hypertension in a rat model of insulin resistance. Rats were fed with 10% D-glucose for a chronic period of 12-14 weeks and the impact of a diet supplemented with alpha-lipoic acid, a potent antioxidant, was determined on tactile and cold allodynia, arterial hypertension and the expression of kinin B1R (real-time PCR and autoradiography) in several tissues. Acute effects of brain penetrant (LF22-0542) and peripherally acting (R-715) B1R antagonists were also assessed. Glucose-fed rats exhibited tactile and cold allodynia along with increases in systolic blood pressure between 4 and 12 weeks; these alterations were alleviated by alpha-lipoic acid. The latter regimen also decreased significantly increased plasma levels of insulin and glucose and insulin resistance (HOMA index) at 14 weeks. B1R mRNA was virtually absent in liver, aorta, lung, kidney and spinal cord isolated from control rats, yet B1R mRNA was markedly increased in all tissues in glucose-fed rats. Up-regulated B1R mRNA and BIR binding sites (spinal cord) were significantly reduced by cc-lipoic acid in glucose-fed rats. LF22-0542 reduced tactile and cold allodynia, (3 h) and reversed arterial hypertension (3-48 h) in glucose-fed rats. R-715 abolished tactile and cold allodynia but had not effect on blood pressure. Data suggest that the oxidative stress contributes to the induction and up-regulation of BIR in the model of insulin resistance induced by glucose feeding. The over expressed BIR contributes centrally to arterial hypertension and in the periphery to sensory abnormalities. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Lungu, C.; Dias, J. P.; de Franca, C.

Transmission disequilibrium study of an oligodendrocyte and myelin glycoprotein gene allele in 431 families with an autistic proband	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						autistic disorder; transmission disequilibrium test; 17q11 autism locus; oligodendrocyte and myelin glycoprotein gene (OMG); rs11080149 polymorphism	PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS; DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; GENOMEWIDE SCREEN; NF1 GENE; ASSOCIATION; SPECTRUM; NEUROFIBROMATOSIS; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; LINKAGE	Autistic disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder where genetic factors play an important role. We previously described an association between a subgroup of French autistic patients and an allele of a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP: OMGP62 G > A or rs11080149) in the gene coding for the oligodendrocyte and myelin glycoprotein (OMG), located at 7 Mb from the marker D17S250, linked to autism in two independent genome scan studies. We report a study on 431 families with I affected child from different origins: French Canada (n = 262), Italy (n = 123) and United States (n = 46). We analyzed the transmission of the rs 11080149 alleles from parents to their affected children. There was a preferential transmission of the G allele from parents to affected children (p = 0.0017) in the overall sample. Paternal and maternal transmission rates were both skewed. Taking into account our previous results obtained in a French group of patients, where we observed an association with allele A, a direct role of this polymorphism is improbable in autism. The associations observed in Japanese and French patients, the linkage studies and the present work speak in favor of the existence of a susceptibility gene for autism in the NF1 locus.

Interestingly, complex neuron-glial interactions at synapses are commonly found in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Although these interactions are known to be important for synaptic physiology, the cellular processes and molecular mechanisms involved have not been fully uncovered. Identifying the common and unique features of neuron-glial interactions between invertebrates and vertebrates may provide valuable insights into the relationship of neuron-glial cross-talk to nervoussystem function. This review highlights selected studies that have revealed structural and functional insights into neuron-glial interactions at synapses in invertebrate and vertebrate model systems.

The present study assessed whether different curve geometries involve different perceptual processing levels and whether these perceptual requirements can interact with the normal aging process. Methods. Amplitude thresholds for three different curve types were assessed for young and older observers using 2AFC psychophysical methods. The stimuli were individually adjusted for visibility. The three stimulus types evaluated represented a bell shape, a quadratic, and a compressed arc function. Results. As predicted, the geometry influenced the perception of curvature where the compressed arc was most difficult to perceive followed by the quadratic and bell-shaped curves. Moreover, older observers showed relatively higher thresholds for the quadratic and compressed arc shapes, while they had similar thresholds to the younger observers for the bell-shaped function. Conclusions. In general, the data support the notion that aging affects the processing of curvature requiring the integration of oriented receptors. This is in accordance with studies that have found reduced orientation selectivity of cortical neurons in senescent animals. Our findings suggest that older observers would have more difficulties with form discrimination tasks where curvature is an inherent component of the image and also predict age-related differences in perceiving ophthalmic lens-induced distortions.

The present survey characterizes the practice of spinal cord stimulator (SCS) and intrathecal analgesic delivery pump (IADP) implantation for pain management in different centres across Canada. METHOD: A structured questionnaire was designed to examine the funding source, infrastructure and patient screening process in different centres implanting SCSs and IADPs. Centres that performed more than 10 implants per year were surveyed. The survey was centre-based, ie, each centre received one questionnaire regardless of the number of staff involved in neuromodulation practice. RESULTS: Fourteen centres were identified and 13 responded. Implantation of SCS and IADP was performed in 12 and 10 centres, respectively. In most centres, failed back surgery syndrome was the most frequent indication for SCS and IADP implantation. For SCS, all centres always performed a trial; the majority used percutaneous electrode (83%) before the SCS implantation. Routine psychological screening was performed in 25% of centres before any SCS trial procedure. For IADP, all centres performed a trial injection or infusion before implantation. Five centres (50%) performed psychological screening in almost all patients. Continuous infusion techniques were the most popular (50%) used for the trial. CONCLUSION: The present survey provides a 'snapshot' of the practice of SCS and IADP implantation in Canada. A review of SCS and IADP trials indicated that Canadian practices are mostly, but not always, consistent with those elsewhere.	[Peng, Philip W.

Humans become tapeworm carriers when they ingest infected pork meat. They can also develop cysticercosis after inadvertently swallowing T. solium eggs. Human neurocysticercosis (NCC) is considered as a public health problem in Mexico and in several countries around the world, mainly developing ones. The development of immunodiagnostic techniques has promoted the conduct of seroepidemiological studies. This review provides insight into the evolution of these techniques, their predictive values and their use infield studies, and summarizes evidence supporting health care practice and policy related to cysticercosis/taeniosis in Mexico. Serological studies in rural and urban settings have demonstrated that close proximity with a tapeworm carrier is the main risk factor for acquiring cysticercosis. Research focusing on the tapeworm carrier generated an ELISA for the detection of Taenia coproantigens and facilitated the evaluation of intervention measures. Health education and self-identification of tapeworm carriers were shown to be successful. However, cestodial treatment as a community-based intervention was not as successful. Current immunodiagnostic techniques can be used to pinpoint transmission foci so that appropriate and effective interventions can be applied. In this way, sustainable control, and even eradication of T. solium may be envisioned.

A novel cascade ensemble classifier system with a high recognition performance on handwritten digits	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						handwritten digit recognition; hybrid feature extraction; cascade classifier system; rejection criteria; ensemble classifier; gating networks; neural networks; genetic algorithms	HIERARCHICAL-CLASSIFICATION; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; STRATEGIES; NUMERALS; NETWORKS	This paper presents a novel cascade ensemble classifier system for the recognition of handwritten digits. This new system aims at attaining a very high recognition rate and a very high reliability at the same time, in other words, achieving an excellent recognition performance of handwritten digits. The trade-offs among recognition, error, and rejection rates of the new recognition system are analyzed. Three solutions are proposed: (i) extracting more discriminative features to attain a high recognition rate, (ii) using ensemble classifiers to suppress the error rate and (iii) employing a novel cascade system to enhance the recognition rate and to reduce the rejection rate. Based on these strategies, seven sets of discriminative features and three sets of random hybrid features are extracted and used in the different layers of the cascade recognition system. The novel gating networks (GNs) are used to congregate the confidence values of three parallel artificial neural networks (ANNs) classifiers. The weights of the GNs are trained by the genetic algorithms (GAs) to achieve the overall optimal performance. Experiments conducted on the MNIST handwritten numeral database are shown with encouraging results: a high reliability of 99.96% with minimal rejection, or a 99.59% correct recognition rate without rejection in the last cascade layer.

Neurogenic bladder monitoring in children	PELVI-PERINEOLOGIE			French	Article						neurogenic bladder; monitoring; evaluation; paediatric; children	MANAGEMENT	Neurogenic bladder in children varies widely in its progression toward renal dysfunction (which could be life threatening) and urinary incontinence (which defines functional prognosis). The goal of monitoring is to minimise these complications, thereby improving the prognosis and quality of life of these often-handicapped patients. Monitoring is based on nine essential elements. Taking a detailed clinical history establishes a baseline for comparing future urinary symptoms, fecal elimination problems and urinary infections. The negative impact of urinary and fecal dysfunction on a child's quality of life can be assessed by simple and directed questions. The abdominal and external genital exam, along with the observation of voiding, can provide valuable information. Determination of serum creatinine levels makes it possible to evaluate renal function, and urine culture and urinalysis tests for the presence of infection. The post-void residual urine volume establishes the voiding ability of the child. Urodynamic studies complete the evaluation of the functional prognosis. Renal ultrasound is a non-invasive test that determines the size and growth of the kidneys and the presence of hydronephrosis and renal calculi. Radiographic and nuclear retrograde cystography allows the detection and quantification of vesicoureteral reflux. Finally, the renal scan assesses differential renal function, glomerular filtration and the degree of obstruction. In conclusion, thorough monitoring of paediatric patients with neurogenic bladder prevents the deterioration of bladder and renal function. It also allows the evaluation of the impact of pharmacological and surgical treatments.

Bilateral hippocampal volume increases after long-term lithium treatment in patients with bipolar disorder: a longitudinal MRI study	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						longitudinal; bipolar disorder; lithium; hippocampus; MRI; volume; memory	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; TEMPORAL-LOBE STRUCTURES; VERBAL-LEARNING TEST; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; CHILDHOOD-ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; RAT DENTATE GYRUS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; MOOD STABILIZERS; IN-VIVO	Rationale The majority of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the hippocampus in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) show no differences in hippocampal volume between patients and healthy controls. Significant variability, however, exists in the medication status of patients included in these studies. In particular, treatment with lithium may exert long-term effects on hippocampal volume, influencing cognitive outcomes in BD patients. Objectives To our knowledge, no longitudinal volumetric study has been performed in patients with BD, which would allow for an examination of whether lithium therapy used to treat BD can exert a long-term effect on hippocampal volume. Materials and methods We examined the effects of lithium on hippocampal volumes and recollective memory performance over a period of 2 to 4 years in 12 patients with BD who had never received pharmacotherapy before lithium initiation. Results We found bilateral increases in volume of the hippocampus over time. We also found some evidence of improvement in verbal memory performance over the 4-year measurement period as assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test. Conclusions Consistent with preclinical literature supporting the neuroprotective effects of lithium, long-term treatment is associated with preservation of recollective memory function and increased hippocampal size in vivo.

We aimed to clarify brain functional abnormalities related to motor response inhibition in schizophrenia by using event-related fMRI in combination with a Go-NoGo task designed to control for non-inhibitory cognitive processes involved in task performance. Method: We studied 21 schizophrenic patients and 21 healthy subjects, group-matched for age, sex, and performance accuracy on a Go-NoGo task during event-related fMRI. The task was designed so that Go and NoGo events were equally probable. Between-group activation differences were assessed using ANCOVAs with response time and IQ as covariates of non-interest. Results: Compared to healthy subjects, schizophrenic patients exhibited a significant decrease in activation during motor response inhibition in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) only. There were no areas of increased brain activation in patients compared to healthy subjects. Conclusions: Schizophrenic patients demonstrate a blunted activation in the right VLPFC, a region known to play a critical role in motor response inhibition. Further research should ascertain the contribution of the VLPFC dysfunction to the impulsive behavior observed in schizophrenia. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CRF systems are activated in response to acute stressors and mediate a wide variety of physiological and behavioral responses to acute stress including aversive responses and responses that support appetitive behaviors. CRF is released in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the cell body region of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic neurons, in response to acute stress and plays a role in stress-activation of appetitive behavior [Wang B, Shaham Y, Zitzman D, Azari S, Wise RA, You ZB (2005) Cocaine experience establishes control of midbrain glutamate and dopamine by corticotropin-releasing factor: a role in stress-induced relapse to drug seeking. J Neurosci 25:5389-5396]. However, although it is known that the VTA region contains significant levels of CRIF-immunoreactive fibers [Swanson LW, Sawchenko PE, Rivier J, Vale WW (1983) Organization of ovine corticotropin-releasing factor immunoreactive cells and fibers in the rat brain: an immunohistochemical study. Neuroendocrinology 36:165-186], the source of CRF input to the region has not been identified. We used infusions of a fluorescent retrograde tracer, fluorogold, into the VTA region, combined with fluorescent immunocytochemistry for CRF to identify sources of this input. Double-labeled cells were found in BNSTov, CeA and PVN. The percent of fluorogold-labeled cells in each region that were CRF-positive was 30.8, 28.0 and 16.7% respectively. These data point to diffusely distributed sources of CRIF-containing fibers in the VTA. (c) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The indicators can be used to evaluate care and services for vulnerable older adults affected by cognitive impairment or dementia within an integrated service system in Quebec, Canada. Methods: A total of 33 clinical experts from three major urban centres in Quebec formed a panel representing two medical specialties ( family medicine, geriatrics) and seven health or social services specialties ( nursing, occupational therapy, psychology, neuropsychology, pharmacy, nutrition, social work), from primary or secondary levels of care, including long-term care. A modified version of the RAND (R)/University of California at Los Angeles ( UCLA) appropriateness method, a two-round Delphi panel, was used to assess face and content validity of process quality indicators. The appropriateness of indicators was evaluated according to a) agreement of the panel with three criteria, defined as a median rating of 7 - 9 on a nine-point rating scale, and b) agreement among panellists, judged by the statistical measure of the interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry. Feasibility of quality assessment and reliability of appropriate indicators were then evaluated within a pilot study on 29 patients affected by cognitive impairment or dementia. For measurable indicators the inter-observer reliability was calculated with the Kappa statistic. Results: Initially, 82 indicators for care of vulnerable older adults with cognitive impairment or dementia were submitted to the panellists. Of those, 72 ( 88%) were accepted after two rounds. Among 29 patients for whom medical files of the preceding two years were evaluated, 63 ( 88%) of these indicators were considered applicable at least once, for at least one patient. Only 22 indicators were considered applicable at least once for ten or more out of 29 patients. Four indicators could be measured with the help of a validated questionnaire on patient satisfaction. Inter-observer reliability was moderate ( Kappa = 0.57). Conclusion: A multidisciplinary panel of experts judged a large majority of the initial indicators valid for use in integrated care systems for vulnerable older adults in Quebec, Canada. Most of these indicators can be measured using patient files or patient or caregiver interviews and reliability of assessment from patient-files is moderate.

A previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study revealed that amusic individuals had reduced white matter in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) relative to musically intact controls (Hyde et al., 2006). However, this VBM study also revealed associated increases in gray matter in the same right IFG region of amusics. The objective of the present study was to better understand this morphological brain anomaly by way of cortical thickness measures that provide a more specific measure of cortical morphology relative to VBM. We found that amusic subjects (n = 21) have thicker cortex in the right IFG and the right auditory cortex relative to musically intact controls (n = 26). These cortical thickness differences suggest the presence of cortical malformations in the amusic brain, such as abnormal neuronal migration, that may have compromised the normal development of a right frontotemporal pathway.

An experimental study previously conducted with young participants was replicated with elderly persons in order to assess the effect of age on the ability to control myoelectric amplitude (or myocontrol). Participants performed pointing tasks as the myoelectric amplitude was captured by a surface electrode in two modalities (sustained: stabilize the amplitude after reaching the desired level; impulsion: return immediately to resting amplitude). There was a significant decrease of performance with Age. However, the patterns of performance of young and aged were noticeably similar. The Impulsion modality was difficult (high rates of failure) and the speed-accuracy trade-offs predicted by Fitts' law were absent (bow-shaped patterns as function of target amplitude instead of logarithmic increase). Conversely, the reach phase of the Sustained modality followed the predictions of Fitts' law. However, the slope of the regression line with Fitts' index of difficulty was quite steeper in aged than in young participants. These findings suggest that 1) all participants, young and aged, adapt their reaching strategies to the anticipated state (sustained amplitude or not) and/or to the difficulty of the task, 2) myocontrol in aged persons is more fragile, i.e., performance is markedly degraded as the difficulty of the task increases. However, when individual performance was examined, some aged individuals were found to perform as well as the young participants, congruently with the literature on good aging.

A major determinant of disease progression is increased peripheral blood proviral load (PVL), possibly via the accumulation of infected cells in the central nervous system (CNS) creating a damaging inflammatory response. Current therapeutic approaches that focus on reducing either cell proliferation, viral replication, or tissue invasion are still unsatisfactory. Contrasting with these inhibitory strategies, we evaluated the efficacy of a novel approach aimed, paradoxically, at activating viral gene expression to expose virus-positive cells to the host immune response. We used valproate (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been used for decades as a chronic, safe treatment for epileptic disorders. Based on in vitro and in vivo data, we provide evidence that transient activation of the latent viral reservoir causes its collapse, a process that may alleviate the condition of HAM/TSP. This represents the first such approach to treating HAM/TSP, using gene activation therapy to tilt the host-pathogen balance in favor of an existing antiviral response.

J	Muller, HFJ				Mueller, Herbert F. J.			Brain in Mind The Mind-Brain Relation with the Mind at the Center	CONSTRUCTIVIST FOUNDATIONS			English	Article						Mind-brain relation; zero-derivation structuring; subject-object relation; working ontology-metaphysics		Purpose-To show that the mind-brain relation can be understood from a perspective that keeps the mind at the center. Problem-Since at least the time of Augustine, the puzzle of the mind-brain relation has been how the mind is attached to, or originates from, the body or brain. This is still the prevalent scientific question. It implies assumption of a primary (ontological) subject-object split, and furthermore that subjective experience can be derived from, or even reduced to, a fictitious mind-independently pre-structured reality. This belief in mind-independent reality is closely related to the development and use of language. It in turn means that the mind cannot be real because it cannot be mind-independent and so disappears from discussion, preventing access to the mind-brain question. Solution-The problem requires an epistemology which keeps subjective experience at the center but does not interfere with objective methods. The un-testable proposition of mind-independent structures can be re-formulated as the use of templates for thinking: a method created by humans, a knowable tool, that is, "working" or "as-if" ontology-metaphysics. Truth and reality, including the reality of objective brain activity, then become working tools within ongoing subject-inclusive encompassing experience. Conclusions-The traditional mind-brain puzzle is the result of erroneous premises, and can be replaced by the question: how does working-objective knowledge originate within encompassing experience? This is a novel and contradiction-free approach to studies of the mind-brain relation and related questions.	[Mueller, Herbert F. J.] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Mueller, Herbert F.

Here, we report that p38 regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation. Inhibition of p38 with PD169316 and SB203580 prevented accumulation of protein and mRNA of cell-stage specific markers characteristic of differentiated oligodendrocytes, including myelin basic protein, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and the glycosphingolipids, galactosylceramide and sulfatide. In addition, the cell cycle regulator p27(kip1) and the transcription factor Sox10 were also significantly reduced. Most significantly, p38 inhibitors completely and irreversibly blocked myelination of dorsal root ganglion neurons by oligodendrocytes and prevented the axolemmal organization of the axo-glial adhesion molecule Caspr. Our results suggest a role(s) for this kinase in key regulatory steps in the maturation of OLGs and initiation of myelination. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In the present study, we investigated specific pathways of [1-C-13]glucose as well as of [2-C-13]acetate in this brain region and the frontal cortex following 4-day manganese treatment by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. Following administration of 50 mg/kg/day manganese, glutamine concentration in the globus pallidus was decreased to 67% of control values but increased in frontal cortex by 56%. Manganese treatment also caused pronounced changes in glutamine-glutamate-GABA interconversion in which region-selective differences were observed in the isotopomer pattern of GABA compared with that of glutamine when including the astrocyte-specific substrate [2-C-13]acetate. In particular, decreased C-13-labeled glutamine, synthesized from [1-C-13]glucose, paralleled accumulation of C-13-labeled GABA in globus pallidus but not in frontal cortex. On the other hand, increased synthesis of glutamine from [2-C-13]acetate showed that GABA accumulation was not due to increased synthesis from astrocytic glutamine. Furthermore, treatment with manganese resulted in a selective decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate in the globus pallidus. These data illustrate the potential importance of alterations in neuronal metabolic function. In particular, neuronal metabolic derangements and regional differences in the ability of astrocytes to fulfill their contribution to the glutamine-glutamate-GABA cycle during the early phase of manganese neurotoxicity may be crucial in determining the severity of cellular injury.

Metabolic alterations underlie many of the mechanisms leading to HE. This paper summarizes in vivo and ex vivo H-1-, C-13-, and N-15-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data on patients and experimental models of HE. In vivo NMR spectroscopy provides a unique opportunity to study metabolic changes noninvasively in the brain in vivo, and to quantify various metabolites in localized brain areas, and ex vivo NMR permits the high-resolution measurement of metabolites and the identification of different metabolic pathways. In vivo and ex vivo H-1-NMR investigations consistently reveal severalfold increases in brain glutamine and concomitant decreases in myo-inositol, an important osmolyte in astrocytes. An osmotic disturbance in these cells has long been suggested to be responsible for astrocyte swelling and brain edema. However, ex vivo C-13-NMR studies have challenged the convention that glutamine accumulation is the major cause of brain edema in acute HE. They rather indicate a limited anaplerotic flux and capacity of astrocytes to detoxify ammonia by glutamine synthesis and emphasize distortions of energy and neurotransmitter metabolism. However, recent N-15-NMR investigations have demonstrated that glutamine fluxes between neurons and astrocytes are affected by ammonia. Further NMR studies may provide novel insights into the relationship between brain edema and/or astrocyte pathology and changes in inter- and intracellular glutamine homeostasis, which may secondarily alter brain energy metabolism.

Direct evidence for these phenomena in humans, though, is sparse. However, recent studies support the following. First, the acute administration of drugs of abuse across pharmacological classes increases extracellular DA levels within the human ventral striatum. Second, individual differences in the magnitude of this response correlate with rewarding effects of the drugs and the personality trait of novelty seeking. Third, transiently diminishing DA transmission in humans decreases drug craving, the propensity to preferentially respond to reward-paired stimuli, and the ability to sustain responding for future drug reward. Finally, very recent studies suggest that repeated exposure to stimulant drugs, either on the street or in the laboratory, can lead to conditioned and sensitized behavioral responses and DA release:. In contrast to these findings, though, in individuals with a long history of substance abuse, drug-induced DA release is decreased. This diminished DA release could reflect two different phenomena. First, it is possible that drug withdrawal related decrements in DA cell function persist longer than previously suspected. Second, drug-paired stimuli may gain marked conditioned control over the release of DA and the expression of sensitization leading to reduced DA release when drug-related cues are absent. Based on these observations a two-factor hypothesis of the role of DA in drug abuse is proposed. In the presence of drug cues, conditioned and sensitized DA release would occur leading to focused drug-seeking behavior. In comparison, in the absence of drug-related stimuli DA function would be reduced, diminishing the ability of individuals to sustain goal-directed behavior and long-term objectives. This conditioned control of the expression of sensitized DA release could aggravate susceptibility to relapse, narrow the range of interests and perturb decision-making, accounting for a wide range of addiction related phenomena.

Organ growth in chicken embryos during hypoxia: Implications on organ "sparing" and "catch-up growth"	RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						embryonic development; heart; hypoxia; lungs; chorioallantoic membrane; normalisation	HIGH-ALTITUDE; CHORIOALLANTOIC MEMBRANE; OXYGEN-TRANSPORT; HYPOXEMIA; HYPEROXIA; RATS; RETARDATION; ADAPTATION; EXCHANGE; BLOOD	The primary aim of this study was to establish whether or not embryonic hypoxia selectively affects the growth of specific organs. Chicken embryos were incubated either in normoxia (Nx) or in hypoxia (15% O2 from embryonic day E5, Hx). The length of the beak and third toe (as indexes of skeletal growth) and the weights of internal organs (eyes, brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, stomach, and intestines) were collected at E14, E 17, E19, and E20. Hypoxia reduced embryonic body weight (BW). At any given age, the specific weight (organ weight/BW) of some organs in Hx was higher, and that of others was lower, than in Nx. However, almost all differences disappeared when organ weights were compared as function of BW, rather than at fixed chronological ages. The important exception was the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), the mass of which in Hx developed out of proportion. In a third group of embryos, hypoxic until E14 and normoxic thereafter, there was no post-hypoxic catch-up growth, differently from what known to occur postnatally. A possible interpretation is that catch-up growth does not depend on the age of the embryo but on its BW. In conclusion, at least in the chicken embryo and for the level of hypoxia tested, hypoxia has no selective effects on the growth of specific organs, except for the CAM. Qualitative differences in the weight response to hypoxia among organs observed at any given age can be explained largely by the effects of the blunted growth on the growth trajectory of the individual organs.

Here we tested the peripheral antinociceptive effects of paraceramol (intraplantar injections) in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Paracetamol dose-dependently decreased mechanical allodynia and lowered nociceptive scores associated with hyperalgesia testing. These effects were inhibited by the administration of cannabinoid CB1 (AM251) and CB2 (AM630) receptor antagonists. The participation of the peripheral cannabinoid system in paracetamol analgesia is suggested. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pitx1 and Pitx2 have partly redundant activities in craniofacial development, including in pituitary organogenesis, as indicated by their names. These genes also exhibit redundant activities in the control of hind limb bud growth. Recent studies have shown expression of the three Pitx genes in muscle, with Pitx3 being the most widely expressed in all skeletal muscles. We now report the identification of a muscle-specific promoter within the Pitx3 gene that is situated between the first exon for eye and brain expression and exon 2 that contains the initiator ATG codon. Sequences proximal to this muscle-specific exon 1 are essential and sufficient to confer muscle-specific expression in transgenic mice, they are responsive to myogenic basic helix-loop-helix regulatory factors, and they recruit these factors in vivo. In agreement with exclusive use of the muscle-specific promoter in aphakia mice that are deleted of the brain promoter, the trimethyl-lysine 4 histone H3 promoter signature shifts to this promoter in embryonic day 13 ak limb bud muscle cells. Myogenic basic helix-loop-helix regulatory factor activation of Pitx3 transcription may be part of a positive feedback loop contributing to establishment of the myogenic program.

It is uncertain whether methylxanthines have long-term effects on neurodevelopment and growth. Methods We randomly assigned 2006 infants with birth weights of 500 to 1250 g to receive either caffeine or placebo until therapy for apnea of prematurity was no longer needed. The primary outcome was a composite of death, cerebral palsy, cognitive delay (defined as a Mental Development Index score of <85 on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development), deafness, or blindness at a corrected age of 18 to 21 months. Results Of the 937 infants assigned to caffeine for whom adequate data on the primary outcome were available, 377 (40.2%) died or survived with a neurodevelopmental disability, as compared with 431 of the 932 infants (46.2%) assigned to placebo for whom adequate data on the primary outcome were available (odds ratio adjusted for center, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.93; P=0.008). Treatment with caffeine as compared with placebo reduced the incidence of cerebral palsy (4.4% vs. 7.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.87; P=0.009) and of cognitive delay (33.8% vs. 38.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.99; P=0.04). The rates of death, deafness, and blindness and the mean percentiles for height, weight, and head circumference at follow-up did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusions Caffeine therapy for apnea of prematurity improves the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental disability at 18 to 21 months in infants with very low birth weight.

Although CNS hyperexcitability is a critical component, recent findings challenge the neuron-centric view of neuropathic pain etiology and pathology. Indeed, glial cells were shown to play an active role in the initiation and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity. However, the origins of these cells and the triggers that induce their activation have yet to be elucidated. Here we show that, after peripheral nerve injury induced by a partial ligation on the sciatic nerve, in addition to activation of microglia resident to the CNS, hematogenous macrophage/monocyte infiltrate the spinal cord, proliferate, and differentiate into microglia. Signaling from chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) to its receptor CCR2 is critical in the spinal microglial activation. Indeed, intrathecal injection of MCP-1 caused activation of microglia in wild-type but not in CCR2-deficient mice. Furthermore, treatment with an MCP-1 neutralizing antibody prevented bone marrow-derived microglia (BMDM) infiltration into the spinal cord after nerve injury. In addition, using selective knock-out of CCR2 in resident microglia or BMDM, we found that, although total CCR2 knock-out mice did not develop microglial activation or mechanical allodynia, CCR2 expression in either resident microglia or BMDM is sufficient for the development of mechanical allodynia. Thus, to effectively relieve neuropathic pain, both CNS resident microglia and blood-borne macrophages need to be targeted. These findings also open the door for a novel therapeutic strategy: to take advantage of the natural ability of bone marrow-derived cells to infiltrate selectively affected CNS regions by using these cells as vehicle for targeted drug delivery to inhibit hypersensitivity and chronic pain.

REM sleep behavior disorder predicts cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease without dementia	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; CEREBRAL ATROPHY; LEWY BODIES; PROGRESSION; PREVALENCE; ALZHEIMERS; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; SYMPTOMS; PROFILE	Objective: To assess the relationship between the presence of REM sleep behavior disorder ( RBD) and the cognitive profile of nondemented patients with Parkinson disease ( PD). Background: Cognitive impairment is an important nonmotor symptom in PD. Waking EEG slowing in nondemented PD has been related to the presence of RBD, a parasomnia affecting brainstem structures and frequently reported in PD. For this reason, RBD may be associated with cognitive impairment in PD. Methods: Thirty-four patients with PD ( 18 patients with polysomnographic-confirmed RBD and 16 patients without RBD) and 25 healthy control subjects matched for age and educational level underwent sleep laboratory recordings and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Results: Patients with PD and concomitant RBD showed significantly poorer performance on standardized tests measuring episodic verbal memory, executive functions, as well as visuospatial and visuoperceptual processing compared to both patients with PD without RBD and control subjects. Patients with PD without RBD had no detectable cognitive impairment compared to controls. Conclusions: This study shows that cognitive impairment in nondemented patients with Parkinson disease ( PD) is closely related to the presence of REM sleep behavior disorder, a sleep disturbance that was not controlled for in previous studies assessing cognitive deficits in PD.

Adult spinal cord progenitor cells are repelled by netrin-1 in the embryonic and injured adult spinal cord	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						adult stem cells; floor plate; migration; guidance	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MORPHOGEN SONIC HEDGEHOG; NEURAL STEM-CELLS; AXON GUIDANCE; COMMISSURAL AXONS; NEURONAL PRECURSORS; RECEPTOR EXPRESSION; DIRECTED MIGRATION; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; MAMMALIAN BRAIN	Adult neural progenitor cells (aNPCs) exhibit limited migration in vivo with the exception of the rostral migratory stream and injury-induced movement. Surprisingly little is known regarding those signals regulating attraction or inhibition of the aNPC. These studies demonstrate that aNPCs respond principally to a repulsive cue expressed at the embryonic floor plate (FIR) and also the injured adult CNS. Adult spinal cord progenitor cells (aSCPs) were seeded onto organotypic slice preparations of the intact embryonic or injured adult spinal cord. Cell migration assays combined with genetic and molecular perturbation of FP-derived migration cues or aSCP receptors establish netrin-1 (Ntn-1) but not Slit-2, Shh, or Ephrin-B3 as the primary FP-derived repellant. When slices were prepared from injured spinal cord, aSCP migration away from the injury core was Ntn-1-dependent. These studies establish Ntn-1 as a critical regulator of aSCP migration in the intact and injured CNS.

Characterization of pancreatic transcription factor pdx-1 binding sites using promoter Microarray and serial analysis of chromatin occupancy	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1; INSULIN-PRODUCING CELLS; NUCLEAR FACTOR 3-BETA; GENOME-WIDE ANALYSIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; BETA-CELLS; REGULATORY REGION; HOMEOBOX FACTOR; IN-VIVO; LIVER	The homeobox transcription factor Pdx-1 is necessary for pancreas organogenesis and beta cell function, however, most Pdx-1-regulated genes are unknown. To further the understanding of Pdx-1 in beta cell biology, we have characterized its genomic targets in NIT-1 cells, a mouse insulinoma cell line. To identify novel targets, we developed a microarray that includes traditional promoters as well as non-coding conserved elements, micro-RNAs, and elements identified through an unbiased approach termed serial analysis of chromatin occupancy. In total, 583 new Pdx-1 target genes were identified, many of which contribute to energy sensing and insulin release in pancreatic beta cells. By analyzing 31 of the protein-coding Pdx-1 target genes, we show that 29 are expressed in beta cells and, of these, 68% are down-or up-regulated in cells expressing a dominant negative mutant of Pdx-1. We additionally show that many Pdx-1 targets also interact with NeuroD1/BETA2, including the micro-RNA miR-375, a known regulator of insulin secretion.

Neurobehavioral functioning after cessation of manganese exposure: A follow-up after 14 years	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE			English	Article						neurotoxicity; ferro-alloy; neurobehavioral; cohort study; cumulated exposure	LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; INDUCED PARKINSONISM; WORKERS; NEUROTOXICITY; INTOXICATION; PERFORMANCE; DYSFUNCTION; WELDERS; DISEASE	Background Little is known on the long-term course of early manganese (Mn) neurotoxic effects. Mn alloy workers were examined in a follow-up study 14 years after exposure ceased at a Canadian facility. Methods The same battery of neurofunctional tests used in the initial examination in 1990 was administered to 77 Mn-workers and 81 referents in 2004. Results Manganese-workers had poorer scores compared to referents both in the initial and follow-up examinations for several motor tasks of the Luria Motor Scale. At follow-up, older Mn-workers (> 45 years at cessation of exposure) had poorer scores than referents for tests of cognitive flexibility. Cumulated exposure was associated with poorer test scores for certain neuromotor and cognitive tests and on a mood scale. Differences on certain tests observed at initial examination were not present at follow-up. Conclusions Manganese exposure was associated with persistent deficits for certain neuromotor functions, cognitive flexibility, and adverse mood states, while recovery occurred for other functions.

The effect of multiple internal representations on context-rich instruction	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							BRAIN; STUDENTS; SCIENCE; PHYSICS; CORTEX	We discuss n-coding, a theoretical model of multiple internal mental representations. The n-coding construct is developed from a review of cognitive and imaging data that demonstrates the independence of information processed along different modalities such as verbal, visual, kinesthetic, logico-mathematic, and social modalities. A study testing the effectiveness of the n-coding construct in classrooms is presented. Four sections differing in the level of n-coding opportunities were compared. Besides a traditional-instruction section used as a control group, each of the remaining three sections were given context-rich problems, which differed by the level of n-coding opportunities designed into their laboratory environment. To measure the effectiveness of the construct, problem-solving skills were assessed as conceptual learning using the force concept inventory. We also developed several new measures that take students' confidence in concepts into account. Our results show that the n-coding construct is useful in designing context-rich environments and can be used to increase learning gains in problem solving, conceptual knowledge, and concept confidence. Specifically, when using props in designing context-rich problems, we find n-coding to be a useful construct in guiding which additional dimensions-need to be attended to.

Vesico-ureteric reflux and urinary tract development in the Pax21Neu+/- mouse	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-RENAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						development; urinary tract maturation; intravesical ureter; ureteric bud	RENAL-COLOBOMA SYNDROME; URETERAL BUD MORPHOGENESIS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; PAX2 MUTATIONS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; KIDNEY DEVELOPMENT; NEPHRIC DUCT; MUTANT MICE; GENE DOSAGE; EXPRESSION	Vesico- ureteric reflux (VUR) is a urinary tract abnormality that affects roughly one- third of patients with renal- coloboma syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in PAX2. Here, we report that a mouse model with an identical mutation, the Pax2(1Neu+/ -) mouse, has a 30% incidence of VUR. In VUR, urine flows retrogradely from the bladder to the ureter and is associated with urinary tract infections, hypertension, and renal failure. The propensity to reflux in the Pax2(1Neu+/-) mouse is correlated with a shortened intravesical ureter that has lost its oblique angle of entry into the bladder wall compared with wild- type mice. Normally, the kidney and urinary tract develop from the ureteric bud, which grows from a predetermined position on the mesonephric duct. In Pax2(1Neu+/-) mice, this position is shifted caudally while surrounding metanephric mesenchyme markers remain unaffected. Mutant offspring from crosses between Pax2(1Neu+/-) and Hoxb7/GFP(+/-) mice have delayed union of the ureter with the bladder and delayed separation of the ureter from the mesonephric duct. These events are not caused by a change in apoptosis within the developing urinary tract. Our results provide the first evidence that VUR may arise from a delay in urinary tract maturation and an explanation for the clinical observation that VUR resolves over time in some affected children.

Persistent low-frequency spontaneous discharge in a-fiber and c-fiber primary afferent neurons during an inflammatory pain condition	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							PLANTAR RAT HINDPAW; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; SENSORY NEURONS; PERIPHERAL MONONEUROPATHY; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; SCIATIC-NERVE; NOCICEPTORS; HYPERALGESIA; SKIN; SENSITIVITY	Background: Primary afferent nociceptor sensitization and its accompanying spontaneous discharge are believed to be the proximate cause of the spontaneous pain and hypersensitivity that follow an acute tissue injury. Evidence for this comes almost entirely from studies limited to the first few minutes to an hour or two after injury, when the inflammatory reaction to injury has just begun. However, there is evidence that inflammatory pain mechanisms differ from acute pain mechanisms and that the mechanisms that drive and modulate inflammatory pain may evolve over time. Methods: The authors surveyed spontaneous afferent discharge in rats with hind paw inflammation evoked by complete Freund adjuvant over the entire 14 days of the inflammatory pain condition, as determined in parallel experiments assessing allodynia and hyperalgesia. Results: Inflammation-evoked heat hyperalgesia, mechano-allodynia, and mechanohyperalgesia began within hours, persisted until at least day 7, and resolved by day 14. A large percentage (23%) of A fibers had spontaneous discharge 2 days after inflammation, but the incidence was much reduced (to 7-9%) by 7 and 14 days. At all times, the A-fiber discharge frequency was low (< 3.0 Hz) or very low (< 0.3 Hz). A large percentage (24%) of C fibers had spontaneous discharge 2 and 7 days after inflammation, but this also declined to near control levels by day 14; C-fiber discharge frequency was also always low (most at 0.3-1.0 Hz). Conclusions: The pain, allodynia, and hyperalgesia associated with an established inflammatory condition are associated with a persistent low-frequency spontaneous discharge in both A-fiber and C-fiber sensory afferents.

Among these, apoptosis observed in the amygdala following myocardial infarction has been pointed out as a consequence of such an inflammatory process. We hypothesized that inhibition of the inducible inflammatory enzyme Cox-2 during the reperfusion period may attenuate the apoptotic process in the amygdala. Anaesthetized rats were subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 40 min, followed by reperfusion. The Cox-2 antagonist Celecoxib (3 mg/kg i.p.) was administered 10 min after the onset of the reperfusion period. After 72 h of reperfusion, infarct size was determined and the lateral and medial amygdala were dissected from the brain. Infarct size was similar between untreated and Celecoxib-treated animals (40-45% of the area at risk). Cox-2 expression was significantly reduced in both parts of the amygdala in the Celecoxib group. Apoptosis regression was observed in the amygdala of the Celecoxib group as shown by decreased number of TUNEL positive cells and by decreased of caspase-3 activation. Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was not significantly altered by Celecoxib while Akt activation was increased in the lateral amygdala but not in the medial amygdala. This data indicates that inhibition of Cox-2 by Celecoxib is associated with regression of apoptosis in the amygdala following myocardial infarction.

Objectives: To report the natural history of MPS-IIID in 2 siblings described by Kaplan and Wolfe in 1987 and to study the phenotype in 2 other unrelated families with MPS-IIID. Design, Setting, and Patients: Case series of 4 patients with MPS-IIID: 2 siblings followed up at the Montreal Neurological Hospital and Institute, 1 patient followed up at the UZ Brussel, and 1 patient recruited through the prenatal counseling program at the UZ Brussel. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical and molecular data collected from 3 families with enzyme-based diagnosis of MPS-IIID. Results: The course of the disease was characteristic of MPS-IIID in all patients, although survival may be longer than was previously reported. In family 1, both siblings were homozygous for a novel nonsense mutation in the GNS gene (c.1168C > T). In family 2, the proband carried a heterozygous mutation occurring in a splice recognition site in the intron 7 boundary (c.876-2A > G). The second mutation in this patient remains to be identified. In family 3, the proband was homozygous for a novel frameshift mutation in GNS due to the insertion of 5 nucleotides (c.1138_1139insGTCCT). Conclusions: Major issues in the care of patients with MPS-IIID include behavioral problems, sleep problems, recurrent infections, dysphagia, and pain from orthopedic complications. To date, all mutations in GNS predict protein truncation, and there is no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation.

Vasopressin neurons of the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus contain among the highest concentrations of dynorphin found in the brain. Dynorphin, an endogenous opioid peptide, is co-localized in the same neurosecretory vesicles as vasopressin and is released alongside vasopressin from the dendrites and axon terminals of vasopressin neurons. We and others have shown that neuropeptide release from the soma and dendrites of vasopressin neurons activates vasopressin receptors and K-opioid receptors to cause activity-dependent modulation of vasopressin neuron activity, and that this is essential for activity patterning in vasopressin neurons.

The TfR is overexpressed on the cerebral endothelium and mediates the transcytosis mechanism. Fab' fragments, known for their reduced interaction with the reticuloendothelial system, were also conjugated to LNC. This coupling was facilitated by the incorporation of lipid PEG(2000) functionalized. with reactive-sulfbydryl maleimide groups (DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide) into LNC shells by a post-insertion procedure, developed initially for liposome pegylation. An interfacial model using the dynamic rising drop technique helped determine the parameters influencing the DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide insertion and the quality of the anchorage. Heat was essential to promote both an important and stable adsorption of DSPE-PEG(2000)-maleimide onto LNC. OX26 MAb were thiolated to react with maleimide functions whereas thiol residues on Fab' fragments were used directly. The number of ligands per nanocapsule was adjusted according to their initial quantity in the coupling reaction mixture, with densities from 16 tol83 whole antibodies and between 42 and 173 Fab' fragments per LNC. The specific association of immunonanocapsules to cells overexpressing TfR was thus demonstrated, suggesting their ability to deliver drugs to the brain. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The practical 'exercises' as well as graduate research on the Golgi apparatus and the decerebrate preparation, carried out by Penfield in Sherrington's laboratory, gave him the groundwork to develop his career as a physiological surgeon, who made fundamental observations on functional localization in the human brain during the surgical treatment of patients afflicted with epilepsy.

Reaching training in rats with spinal cord injury promotes plasticity and task specific recovery	BRAIN			English	Article						spinal cord injury; plasticity; rehabilitation; training; cortical reorganization	LOCOMOTOR RECOVERY; DIGIT MOVEMENTS; PYRAMIDAL TRACT; MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN-INJURY; FORELIMB USE; EXPRESSION; LESIONS; MODULATION; TREADMILL	In the current study we examined the effects of training in adult rats with a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). One group of rats received 6 weeks of training in a single pellet reaching task immediately after injury, while a second group did not receive training. Following this period changes in cortical levels of BDNF and GAP-43 were analysed in trained and untrained animals and in a group with training but no injury. In another group of rats, functional recovery was analysed in the reaching task and when walking on a horizontal ladder. Thereupon, the cortical forelimb area was electrophysiologically examined using micro-stimulation followed by tracing of the lesioned corticospinal tract (CST). We found that trained rats improved substantially in the reaching task, when compared to their untrained counterparts. Trained rats however, performed significantly worse with their injured forelimb when walking on a horizontal ladder. In parallel to the improved recovery in the trained task, we found that the cortical area where wrist movements could be evoked by micro-stimulation expanded in trained rats in comparison to both untrained and uninjured rats. Furthermore, collateral sprouting of lesioned CST fibres rostral to the injury was increased in trained rats. Post-injury training was also found to increase cortical levels of GAP-43 but not BDNF. In conclusion we show that training of a reaching task promotes recovery of the trained task following partial SCI by enhancing plasticity at various levels of the central nervous system (CNS), but may come at the cost of an untrained task.

Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass: does aprotinin affect outcome?	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						anaesthesia, cardiac; aprotinin; blood, loss; outcome; surgery, cardiac	HYPOTHERMIC CIRCULATORY ARREST; HIGH-DOSE APROTININ; ACUTE-RENAL-FAILURE; GRAFT-SURGERY; INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION; BLOOD-TRANSFUSION; RISK-FACTORS; METAANALYSIS; MULTICENTER; DYSFUNCTION	Background. Aprotinin, a non-specific serine protease inhibitor, has been used for two decades to reduce perioperative blood loss and the risk for allogeneic transfusion in cardiac surgery. This study evaluated the effects of aprotinin on outcome (mortality, cardiac events, renal failure, and cerebrovascular events) in such patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods. Data were obtained in patients who received a strict blood conservation protocol: no antifibrinolytic therapy when at low risk (n=854) and aprotinin (n=1210) when at high risk for blood transfusion. Relative risk of different pre- and intra-operative variables was calculated for the different outcome variables. Backward stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors associated with the different outcome variables. Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.01. Results. Postoperative mortality and morbidity were higher in the aprotinin group but this was related to an increased incidence of perioperative risk factors. Mortality was similar to that predicted by the Euroscore. Complex surgery was the only independent variable associated with postoperative cardiac events. Preoperative heart failure, preoperative creatinine > 1.5 mg dl(-1), urgent, and redo surgery were the independent variables associated with postoperative haemodialysis. Age > 70 yr was identified as the only independent variable associated with neurologic dysfunction. Conclusions. In the present study, patients receiving aprotinin as part of a strict blood conservation strategy represent a population at high risk for postoperative complications. For the outcome variables studied, aprotinin administration was not identified as an independent risk factor.

BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Review							SILDENAFIL VIAGRA; INHIBITORS; SAFETY; NAION	Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor drugs for erectile dysfunction have revolutionised the treatment of male sexual dysfunction and are among the best selling drugs worldwide. Several cases of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) have been reported since 2005 in users of these agents. NAION is a sudden irreversible cause of visual loss with a poorly understood aetiology that affects up to 10 adults per 100 000 each year. Following a series of such case reports, WHO and FDA have labelled the association between use of PDE5 inhibitors and risk of NAION as "possibly'' causal. There have been several recent studies of this association, including a rechallenge case report and a large managed care database study. However, the inability to confirm or refute claims of an association between NAION and EDD is generating clinical and regulatory uncertainty. Questions surrounding use of PDE5 inhibitors and risk of NAION highlight weaknesses in current systems used to identify and evaluate uncommon adverse effects of medication use. This paper reviews all the recent evidence on PDE5 inhibitors and the risk of NAION.

DESIGN Modified Delphi technique. SETTING Province of Quebec. PARTICIPANTS Seven clinicians from 3 different medical faculties in Quebec were selected for their expertise in dementia and geriatric care. METHOD From among the indicators developed in 2001 using the RAND method, 22 items selected for their relevance to evaluation and management of cognitive disorders were adapted to clinical practice in the Quebec hospital system. These indicators, along with evidence from the literature, were submitted by mail to a panel of experts. The experts were asked to rate, on a scale of I to 9, their level of agreement with the indicators in terms of their validity and quality and the need for them to be recorded in patients' medical charts. For an indicator to be retained, it had to be accepted according to its median value, to be rated in the upper third of the scale, and to be approved by the panelists. Indicators not accepted at first were modified according to experts' comments and then resubmitted to the same panel for a second round. RESULTS Of 22 indicators submitted in the first round, 21 were validated. They covered assessment, investigation, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up. The indicator found questionable was modified and then accepted during the second round. CONCLUSION This study identified 22 indicators relevant to assessment and management of patients with cognitive disorders in geriatric assessment units. These indicators will serve as a basis for evaluation of dementia in a larger study of the quality of care in all short-term geriatric assessment units in Quebec.

Memory bias refers to the modulatory influence that state or trait psychopathology may exert on memory performance for specific categories of stimuli, often emotional in nature. For example, subjects suffering from depression frequently have better memory for negative stimuli than for neutral or positive ones. This dimension of memory function has received only scant attention in schizophrenia research but could provide fresh new insights into the relation between symptoms and neurocognition. This paper reviews the studies that have explored memory biases in individuals with schizophrenia. With respect to positive symptoms, we examine studies that have explored the link between persecutory delusions and memory bias for threatening information and between psychosis and a memory bias toward external source memory. Although relatively few studies have examined negative symptoms, we also review preliminary evidence indicating that flat affect and anhedonia may lead to some specific emotional memory biases. Finally, we present recent findings from our group delineating the relation between emotional valence for faces and memory bias toward novelty and familiarity, both in schizophrenia patients and in healthy control subjects. A better understanding of the biasing effects of psychopathology on memory in schizophrenia (but also on other cognitive functions, such as attention, attribution, and so forth) may provide a stronger association between positive and negative symptoms and memory function. Memory measures sensitive to such biases may turn out to be stronger predictors of clinical and functional outcome.

In the present study we used a combination of pharmacological, biochemical and photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer (pbFRET) to determine the functional interactions between human somatostatin receptor 2 (hSSTR2) and human dopamine receptor 2 (hD2R) in both co-transfected CHO-K1 or HEK-293 cells as well as in cultured neuronal cells which express both the receptors endogenously. In monotransfected CHO-K1 or HEK-293 cells, D2R exists as a preformed dimer which is insensitive to agonist or antagonist treatment. In control CHO-K1 cells stably co-transfected with hD2R and hSSTR2, relatively low FRET efficiency and weak expression in co-immunoprecipitate from HEK-293 cells suggest the absence of preformed heterooligomers. However, upon treatment with selective ligands, hD2R and hSSTR2 exhibit heterodimerization. Agonist-induced heterodimerization was accompanied by increased affinity for dopamine and augmented hD2R signalling as well as prolonged hSSTR2 internalization. In contrast, cultured striatal neurons display constitutive heterodimerization between D2R and SSTR2, which were agonist-independent. However, heterodimerization in neurons was completely abolished in the presence of the D2R antagonist eticlopride. These findings suggest that hD2R and hSSTR2 operate as functional heterodimers modulated by ligands in situ, which may prove to be a useful model in designing new therapeutic drugs.

It has a high impact on our society due to its disabling nature and, therein, reduced quality of life and increased absenteeism from work. Headache is the primary clinical manifestation and it has been associated with 'a hereditary or predisposed sensitivity of neurovascular reactions to certain stimuli or to cyclic changes in the central nervous system' (1). Amongst the many neurotransmitters in the brain, the serotonergic (serotonin, 5-HT) system from the brainstem raphe nucleus has been most convincingly implicated in migraine pathophysiology. The documented changes in 5-HT metabolism and in the processing of central 5-HT-mediated responses during and in between migraine attacks have led to the suggestion that migraine is a consequence of a central neurochemical imbalance that involves a low serotonergic disposition. Although the exact cascade of events that link abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission to the manifestation of head pain and the accompanying symptoms has yet to be fully understood, recent evidence suggests that a low 5-HT state facilitates activation of the trigeminovascular nociceptive pathway, as induced by cortical spreading depression. In this short review, we present and discuss the original and most recent findings that support a role for altered serotonergic neurotransmission in the manifestation of migraine headache.

Other lines of evidence suggest that this area of the brain represents quite basic information about the relative '' economic '' value of options, predicting a role for this region in value-based decision making even in the absence of uncertainty. We tested this prediction in human subjects with VMF damage. Preference judgment is a simple form of value-based decision making under certainty. We asked whether VMF damage in humans would lead to inconsistent preference judgments in a simple pairwise choice task. Twenty-one participants with focal damage to the frontal lobes were compared with 19 age- and education-matched control subjects. Subjects with VMF damage were significantly more inconsistent in their preferences than controls, whereas those with frontal damage that spared the VMF performed normally. These results argue that VMF plays a necessary role in certain as well as uncertain decision making in humans.

In rare diseases, including pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM), the lack of readily available fresh frozen (FF) material limits the feasibility of this analysis, as well as its validation, on independent data sets, a step needed to ensure relevance, mandating the use of alternate RNA sources. To overcome the limitation of material number and to validate results we obtained on FF pGBM, we did microarray analysis on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival samples from pGBM and control brains, wherein we had no control on the fixation process. Experimental Design: RNA from 16 pGBM and 3 control brains was extracted and linearly amplified. Reverse transcription - PCR on housekeeping and formerly identified tumor-associated genes and microarray analysis were done on this RNA source. Results were validated by immunohistochemistry. Results: Despite extensive RNA degradation, microarray analysis was possible on 16 of 19 samples and reproduced the pattern of results obtained on FF pGBM. Gene lists and ontology subgrouping were highly concordant in both sample types. Similar to the findings on FF samples, we were able to identify two subsets of pGBM based on their association/lack of association with evidence consistent with an active Ras pathway. Conclusions: Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues are an invaluable resource as they are the most widely available materials often accessible in conjunction with clinical and follow-up data. Gene expression profiling on this material is feasible and may represent a significant advance for understanding the biology of rare human diseases.

The objectives of this study were to describe the changes in trunk and lower limbs postural orientation and muscles activities during and after the end of bilateral Achilles tendon vibration (TV). Methods: Twelve healthy young subjects were exposed to 30 s periods of TV while blindfolded. Whole-body kinematics, kinetics and EMG of eight lower limb and trunk muscles were recorded prior, during and 5 or 25 s after TV. Results: TV during quiet standing produced a whole-body backward shift characterized by greater extension in the trunk and lower limbs. Five seconds after TV, two trends of recovery could be observed, either an overcorrection or undercorrection of the initial position. Conclusions: A continuum of postural orientations are adopted during and after vibration and the movements are not restricted to the ankle joints, despite the local nature of the proprioceptive stimulation. Significance: The widespread influence of vibration as a proprioceptive stimulation when assessing its effects on posture and balance needs to be considered.

Assessment of visual working memory using event-related potentials	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						event-related potentials; memory; recollection; familiarity; cognitive assessment; old/new effects	BRAIN POTENTIALS; RECEPTIVE VOCABULARY; INNOVATIVE METHOD; WISC-III; PERFORMANCE; ERP; COMPREHENSION; RECOGNITION; APHASIA; STROKE	Objective: This study sought to determine if recognition/familiarity memory can be measured using event-related potentials (ERP) in response to a computer-adapted version of a commonly used non-verbal memory assessment instrument. If successful, resulting ERP would further our knowledge of the neurophysiology of recognition memory and could be used in a cognitive assessment battery for individuals whose capacity for verbal and/or non-verbal communication is impaired. Methods: Behavioral and ERP responses were recorded during performance on a computer-adapted version of the Continuous Visual Memory Test (CVMT) [Trahan DE, Larrabee GJ. Continuous Visual Memory Test. Lutz, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources; 1988] and examined offline for recognition memory old/new effects. Behavioral performance was also compared with performance on an alternate form of the test under standard administration procedures. Results: ERP to old (repeated) visual designs in the CVMT were more positive-going than those to new designs and reflected by both early frontal and late parietal old/new effects as commonly reported in the recognition memory literature. The behavioral results from the computer-adapted and standard administration versions of the CVMT showed a significant correlation. Conclusions: The computer-adapted ERP version of the CVMT provides a way to directly assess, using neurophysiological responses, the cognitive processes associated with recognition memory as measured by the CVMT. Significance: The results from this study contribute to linking the functional and neurophysiological profile of memory produced by experimental neuroimaging research with traditional clinical neuropsychological assessment.

Reuse of liver graft from a brain dead recipient	CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Joint International Congress of ILTS/ELITA/LICAGE	MAY 03-06, 2006	Milan, ITALY	ILTS, ELIT, LICAGE		fulminant hepatitis; liver transplantation; re-use	INITIAL TRANSPLANTATION; FAILURE; PROCUREMENT; EXPERIENCE; PERIOD	Background: Brain death in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is a rare occurrence after successful orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Reuse of the liver graft may be considered. We report a successful OLT using such an organ in a 62-yr-old man with hematochromatosis-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Liver donor was 56-yr-old man with normal liver function tests. First recipient was a 26-yr-old woman with an acetaminophen-induced FHF. Before OLT, she developed progressive coma without obvious cerebral edema on the cerebral CT-scan. The transplantation proceeded as planned and was uneventful. However, patient exhibited bilateral non-reactive mydriasis during postoperative hours and was declared brain dead. Transplanted liver was functioning adequately. Its reuse was discussed with her family and the second recipient. After informed consent, the transplanted liver and heart were harvested. First and second liver cold ischemia times were 10 h and 75 min, respectively. Results: Second recipient recovered uneventful and discharged 23 d after OLT. Liver function is still normal 30 months after OLT without rejection or hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence. Conclusion: Even after OLT, brain death remains possible in FHF. In absence of contraindications, reuse of transplanted liver allows for a rational use of already rare liver grafts.

Neurotoxicological effects of a primary and ozonated treated wastewater on freshwater mussels exposed to an experimental flow-through system	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						GABA; serotonin; dopamine; acetylcholinesterase; excitotoxicity; municipal effluents; mussels	INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS; MYTILUS-EDULIS; MUNICIPAL EFFLUENTS; ELLIPTIO-COMPLANATA; ESTERASE-ACTIVITIES; BIVALVE MOLLUSKS; MARINE MUSSEL; MYA-ARENARIA; DOPAMINE; OZONE	The neurotoxic potential of a primary-treated and ozonated municipal effluent was examined using feral freshwater Elliptio complanata mussels. Specimens were exposed to increasing concentrations (0, 1, 3, 10 and 20% v/v) of a primary-treated effluent before and after treatment with 10 mg/L of ozone in a mesocosm-type experiment for 30 days. A suite of biomarkers was used to assess the potential neurotoxic stress of the wastewaters on these benthic invertebrates: opiate binding sites, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism, monoamines levels (serotonin, dopamine), monoamine oxidase, acetylcholinesterase and lipid peroxidation. Gametogenic activity was also determined by the gonado-somatic index and by vitellogenin-like proteins. The results show that the number of opiate binding sites increased slightly, especially after ozonation. GABA metabolism was generally reduced, suggesting higher glutamate stimulation than GABA dampening effects in mussel ganglia. This excitatory state was further confirmed by decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in gonadal tissues. The turnover of dopamine was enhanced with increased serotonin levels, but accompanied by reduced catabolism, as evidenced by decreased monoamine oxidase activity. Moreover, oxidative stress was increased, as determined by lipid peroxidation in the gonad (containing ganglia), which was significantly correlated with acetylcholinesterase activity and dopamine metabolism. The gonado-somatic index was significantly reduced with increased levels of vitellogenin-like proteins, again confirming the estrogenic action of these wastewaters. The data suggest that exposure to a primary-treated municipal effluent before and after ozonation leads to an excitotoxic syndrome implicating perturbations in GABA, dopamine and acetylcholine signaling. The increase in dopamine metabolism may be associated with the occurrence of opiate-like compounds (i.e. morphine) in the effluent. In general, ozonation reduced the severity of the responses, indicating that this disinfection strategy does not increase neurotoxicity to mussels. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Most EEG-fMRI studies in epilepsy have been performed in adults. Childhood epilepsies, however, differ from those in adults due to interactions between epileptogenic and developmental processes. The purpose of this study was to investigate EEG-fMRI in children with lesional epilepsies. Methods: Thirteen children with symptomatic epilepsy underwent a 20-min EEG-fMRI acquisition at 3 T under sedation-induced sleep. Statistical analysis was performed using the timing of spikes as events, modelled with hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) that peaked at 3, 5, 7, and 9 s after the spike. Results: Each spike type was analyzed separately, resulting in 25 studies. In 84% of the studies, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses were localized in the lesion or brain area presumably generating spikes. Activation (positive BOLD) corresponding with the lesion was seen in 20% and deactivation (negative BOLD) in 52% of the studies. In the area of spike generation, activation was found in 48% of studies and deactivation in 36%. Conclusions: Despite the necessarily short recording times (20 min), good results could be obtained from the EEG-fMRI recordings, performed in sedated children using a high field scanner and individual HRFs. In contrast to studies in adults, deactivations in the lesion and the irritative zone were more common than activations. The impact of age, sleep, and sedation on the BOLD response might explain these findings, but future studies in children should not disregard the importance of deactivations in relation to the epileptogenic network.

Study design: A prospective cohort study of women with PPROM between 24017 and 3361 7 weeks' in singleton gestation was performed in all maternity wards of the Rhone-Alpes Region. Neonatal and infant outcomes were compared according to the latency period (< 48 h and > 48 h). The primary outcome was the mortality rate and the secondary outcome was a composite variable of significant neurological disorders at 2 years of age. Outcomes was stratified according to gestational age at rupture. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used with SAS statistical software. Results: Out of 471 women recruited in the study at a mean gestational age of 30.5 +/- 0.2 weeks, 170 (37%) presented with a < 48-h latency period, and 301 (63%), a >= 48-h latency period. While prior to 30 weeks' gestation, the mortality rate was higher in neonates with a short latency period (16.3% versus 7.3%, p < 0.01) with pulmonary disease being the major cause of death, a short latency period was associated with a lower mortality rate after 30 weeks' gestation (0% versus 3.7%, p = 0.02). After adjusting for confounding factors, a < 48-h latency period remained an independent factor associated with infant mortality prior to 30 week's gestation (odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.3-11.7). Significant neurological disorders were not modified by the length of the latency period. Conclusion: For PPROM that occur before 30 weeks' gestation, a short latency period was associated with a higher infant mortality rate. Inversely, it was associated with a lower mortality rate after 30 weeks'. There is an urgent need for a thorough evaluation of expectant management of PPROM after 30 weeks' gestation.

Cells in this brainstem structure not only analyze auditory stimuli but they also play a major role in multi-modal integration of auditory and visual information. The aim of the present study was to determine whether cells in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC) of normal rats respond selectively to complex auditory signals, such as species-specific vocalizations, and compare their responses to those obtained in neonatal bilateral enucleated (P2-P3) adult rats. Extra-cellular recordings were carried out in anesthetized normal and enucleated rats using auditory stimuli (pure tones, broadband noise and vocalizations) presented in free field in a semi-anechoic chamber. The results indicate that most cells in the CNIC of both groups respond selectively to species-specific vocalizations better than to the same but inverted sounds. No significant differences were found between the normal and enucleated rat groups in their responses to broadband noise and pure tones.

This allows study of regulation of neurite development on a single cell basis. However, it is unclear whether the neurites induced by differentiation have features characteristic of dendrites or axons. To address this question, RGC-5 cells were differentiated with staurosporine and then immunoblotted for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and actin, or stained immunocytochemically for different MAP2 isoforms, tau, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43). or the neuronal marker beta-III-tubulin. We found that staurosporine-induced differentiation led to an upregulation of MAP2c, a MAP2 isoform expressed in developing neurons. Some neurites expressed MAP2c but not the dendritic markers MAP2a and MAP2b, consistent with an axonal phenotype. Some neurites expressed the axonal marker tau in a characteristic proximal-to-distal gradient, and had GAP-43 labeling characteristic of axonal growth cones. The presence of MAP2c in differentiated RGC-5 cells is indicative of RGC-like neurite development, and the pattern of staining for the different MAP2 isoforms, as well as positivity for tau and GAP-43, indicates that differentiation induces axon-like and dendrite-like neurites.

In both, WM is required to link two nonadjacent positions. Syntactically, they are governed by distinct rule systems. In health, the two dependencies modulated activity in distinct brain regions within the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left middle temporal gyrus. Binding uniquely modulated activation in the right frontal lobe. Receptive abilities in brain damaged patients likewise distinguished among these syntactic types. The results indicate that sentence comprehension is governed by syntactically carved neural chunks and provide hints regarding a language related region in the right hemisphere.

The influence of both the hydrological models and the meteorological inputs driving these models on climate scenario simulation studies are investigated. A regression-based statistical tool (SDSM) is used to downscale the daily precipitation and temperature data based on climate predictors derived from the Canadian global climate model (CGCM1), and two types of hydrological model, namely the physically based watershed model WatFlood and the lumped-conceptual modelling system HBV-96, are used to simulate the flow regimes in the major rivers of the Saguenay watershed in Quebec. The models are validated with meteorological inputs from both the historical records and the statistically downscaled outputs. Although the two hydrological models demonstrated satisfactory performances in simulating stream flows in most of the rivers when provided with historic precipitation and temperature records, both performed less well and responded differently when provided with downscaled precipitation and temperature data. By demonstrating the problems in accurately simulating river flows based on downscaled data for the current climate, we discuss the difficulties associated with downscaling and hydrological models used in estimating the possible hydrological impact of climate change scenarios.

By an optimized combination of signals from the array channels and complex averaging of measurements, this method leads to a significant reduction of the noise bias. This combination algorithm allows computation of accurate tensors by using the simple two point method and is shown to provide results similar to the ones obtained using the standard signal combination and a nonlinear regression method with noise parameter estimation. In many applications, the use of this combination method would result in a scan time reduction in comparison to the current standard. The effects of the improved combination on diffusion decay curves, fractional anisotropy maps, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) profiles are demonstrated.

Binocular summation of contrast remains intact in strabismic amblyopia	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; INTEROCULAR SUPPRESSION; ANISOMETROPIC AMBLYOPES; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION; CORTICAL-NEURONS; STRIATE CORTEX; VISUAL-ACUITY; HUMAN-VISION; SENSITIVITY	PURPOSE. Strabismic amblyopia is typically associated with several visual deficits, including loss of contrast sensitivity in the amblyopic eye and abnormal binocular vision. Binocular summation ratios ( BSRs) are usually assessed by comparing contrast sensitivity for binocular stimuli ( sens(BIN)) with that measured in the good eye alone ( sens GOOD), giving BSR = sens (BIN)/ sens GOOD. This calculation provides an operational index of clinical binocular function, but does not assess whether neuronal mechanisms for binocular summation of contrast remain intact. This study was conducted to investigate this question. METHODS. Horizontal sine- wave gratings were used as stimuli ( 3 or 9 cyc/ deg; 200 ms), and the conventional method of assessment ( above) was compared with one in which the contrast in the amblyopic eye was adjusted ( normalized) to equate monocular sensitivities. RESULTS. In nine strabismic amblyopes ( mean age, 32 years), the results confirmed that the BSR was close to unity when the conventional method was used ( little or no binocular advantage), but increased to approximately v 2 or higher when the normalization method was used. The results were similar to those for normal control subjects ( n = 3; mean age, 38 years) and were consistent with the physiological summation of contrast between the eyes. When the normal observers performed the experiments with a neutral- density ( ND) filter in front of one eye, their performance was similar to that of the amblyopes in both methods of assessment. CONCLUSIONS. The results indicate that strabismic amblyopes have mechanisms for binocular summation of contrast and that the amblyopic deficits of binocularity can be simulated with an ND filter. The implications of these results for best clinical practice are discussed.

Design: Quantitative, longitudinal design. Setting: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of two Canadian urban hospitals. Participants: Sixty-one couples who had an infant born weighing less than 1,500 g. Main Outcome Measures: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Parenting Sense of Competence questionnaire, and the Support in Parenting Questionnaire were completed at 3 and 9 months of age. Parent-infant interaction was observed at 9 months and scored with the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale. Results: Fathers' reported parenting self-efficacy was significantly lower than mothers' at both 3 and 9 months of age. Fathers reported more received support than mothers, and the amount of support that both mothers and fathers reported increased significantly from the 3-month to the 9-month assessment. Mothers and fathers reported similar levels of anxiety and perceived helpfulness of the support they received and were equally sensitive and responsive in interactions with their infants at 9 months of age. Conclusions: Similarities and differences between mothers and fathers were observed. It is important for nurses to assess mothers and fathers, how any differences are perceived by the couple, and how any differences might be affecting them during the neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization and in early months after discharge.

We conducted experiments using two tasks: a shape recognition task and a position recognition task. It was found that the oxy-Hb concentration was substantially higher in the lateral occipital regions during shape recognition than during position recognition. The changes in the oxy-Hb concentration were considered to reflect the activation difference between the two tasks. No difference was observed in the oxy-Hb concentration during the memorization of shape and memorization of position. The deoxy-Hb concentration was different between the two tasks only when different stimuli were used but not when identical stimuli were used. In addition, it was suggested that the deoxy-Hb concentration is more sensitive to activation difference between the hemispheres and the activation at some regions. Measurements of the oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb concentrations would reflect different aspects of cortical activations. The present results showed that measuring the oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb concentrations separately can differentiate the activation of the regional cortical functions.

Muscle biopsy revealed fibers with central nuclei resembling myotubes and negative myotubularin immuno-histochernical staining compared with a control muscle biopsy. The absence of myotubularin associated with survival motor neuron protein deficiency suggests that survival motor neuron protein may have a role in muscle fiber maturation and myotubularin expression. Studying the pathology of this rare and lethal neonatal form of spinal muscular atrophy may further our understanding of spinal muscular atrophy pathogenesis.

Neuropsychological outcomes from a Randomized trial of triple intrathecal chemotherapy compared with 18 gy cranial radiation as CNS treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Findings from dana-farber cancer institute ALL consortium protocol 95-01	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM SURVIVORS; FOLLOW-UP; INTELLECTUAL FUNCTION; THERAPEUTIC-EFFICACY; CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA; COGNITIVE SEQUELAE; YOUNG-CHILDREN; METHOTREXATE; IRRADIATION; NEUROTOXICITY	Purpose We evaluated late neuropsychological toxicity in children treated for standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were randomly assigned to receive either cranial radiation therapy (CRT) with double intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy or intensive triple IT chemotherapy (no CRT) as CNS-directed therapy. Patients and Methods Between 1996 and 2000, 164 children with standard-risk ALL treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Consortium Protocol 95-01 were randomly assigned to receive either 18 Gy CRT delivered in twice daily fractions (9 Gy) with double IT therapy (methotrexate and cytarabine) or intensive triple IT drug (methotrexate, cytarabine and hydrocortisone) without CRT. Neuropsychological testing was completed at a median 6 years postdiagnosis for 79 children (CRT, n = 39; triple IT, n = 40), all of whom were in continuous complete remission. Results Cognitive function for both groups was solidly in the average range, with no consistent group differences in basic cognitive skills. Children treated on the CRT plus double IT arm did, however, exhibit less fluent output and were less effective at modulating their behavior by parent report. Conclusion This randomized trial revealed only subtle differences 6 years after diagnosis between children who received CNS therapy as CRT plus double IT drug or as intensive triple IT drug. In most situations where comparable therapeutic efficacy can be achieved without CRT, it is preferable to do so. Where therapeutically necessary, however, CRT at lower doses may not add risk for significant neurotoxicity.

Incidence of neuroblastoma after a screening program	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article							PATHOLOGY CLASSIFICATION; MORTALITY; TRENDS	Purpose A significant increase in the incidence of neuroblastoma occurred among a 5-year birth cohort (May 1989 to April 1994) during an active urinary screening program for its early detection. We examined the postscreening incidence of neuroblastoma in the subsequent 5-year birth cohort (May 1994 to April 1999), with follow-up to 2002, to determine whether the incidence remained increased. Patients and Methods We reviewed institutional records of patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma during the period from 1994 to 2002 who were born in 1994 to 1999 in the province of Quebec, as well as in the state of Minnesota and the province of Ontario, regions that had served as controls during the screening interval. We calculated and compared incidence rates during the 1994 to 2002 time period. Results For the 5-year birth cohort as a whole, the rate of newly diagnosed neuroblastoma was higher in Quebec than in the control populations of Minnesota and Ontario (standardized incidence ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.70). However, in years 4 and 5 of the interval, population-based incidence declined to the same levels as those seen in the control areas. Conclusion The institution of a urinary screening program for neuroblastoma led to increased awareness of the diagnosis and an elevated rate of diagnosis even after the completion of the screening evaluation. However, this halo effect was transient, with diagnostic rates subsequently decreasing within the range seen in control populations.

Modeling the effect of topography on wind flow using a combined numerical-neural network approach	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							2-DIMENSIONAL HILLS; PREDICTION; SIMULATION	The impact of topography on design wind speed is addressed in current building codes and design standards by providing "speed-up" ratios for limited cases of terrain geometries. This paper proposes a combined numerical-neural network (NN) approach to provide speed-up ratios for a wide range of topographic features such as single and multiple hills, escarpments, and valleys. In this approach learning data required by the NN is generated via a detailed numerical approach based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Use of the developed model only requires simple geometrical input such as slope, height, and ground roughness while producing results of comparable accuracy to complex numerical evaluations. This combined CFD-NN approach not only produces data for new cases but also conveys the results of complex CFD simulations to the engineering profession (end user). Results compare well with an independent set of experimental data demonstrating the feasibility of the CFD-NN approach to generate data to apply wind design load provisions to buildings with upstream complex terrain.

External validation of a nomogram for prediction of side-specific extracapsular extension at robotic radical prostatectomy	JOURNAL OF ENDOUROLOGY			English	Article							POSITIVE SURGICAL MARGINS; RETROPUBIC PROSTATECTOMY; NEUROVASCULAR BUNDLE; NERVE PRESERVATION; CANCER; ANASTOMOSIS; SPECIMENS; OUTCOMES; ANTIGEN; UPDATE	Background and Purpose: Several staging tools have been developed for open radical prostatectomy (ORP) patients. However, the validity of these tools has never been formally tested in patients treated with robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP). We tested the accuracy of an ORP-derived nomogram in predicting the rate of extracapsular extension (ECE) in a large RALP cohort. Patients and Methods: Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and side-specific clinical stage and biopsy Gleason sum information were used in a previously validated nomogram predicting side-specific ECE. The nomogram-derived predictions were compared with the observed rate of ECE, and the accuracy of the predictions was quantified. Each prostate lobe was analyzed independently. As complete data were available for 576 patients, the analyses targeted 1152 prostate lobes. Median age and serum PSA concentration at radical prostatectomy were 60 years and 5.4 ng/mL, respectively. Results: The majority of side-specific clinical stages were T-1c (993; 86.2%). Most side-specific biopsy Gleason sums were 6 (572; 49.7%). The median side-specific percentages of positive cores and of cancer were, respectively, 20.0% and 5.0%. At final pathologic review, 107 patients (18.6%) had ECE, and side-specific ECE was present in 117 patients (20.3%). The nomogram was 89% accurate in the RALP cohort v 84% in the previously reported ORP validation. Conclusions: The ORP side-specific ECE nomogram is highly accurate in the RALP population, suggesting that predictive and possibly prognostic tools developed in ORP patients may be equally accurate in their RALP counterparts.

J	Pernet, V; Bourgeois, P; Di Polo, A				Pernet, Vincent; Bourgeois, Philippe; Di Polo, Adriana			A role for polyamines in retinal ganglion cell excitotoxic death	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						excitotoxicity; neuroprotection; NMDA; polyamines; retina	METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; INHIBITOR ALPHA-DIFLUOROMETHYLORNITHINE; NMDA-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY; ADULT-RAT RETINA; IN-VIVO; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; NITRIC-OXIDE; GLUTAMATE NEUROTOXICITY; AXON REGENERATION; PROTECTIVE ACTION	Neuronal death due to excessive activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. The polyamines: putrescine, spermine, and spermidine, bind to specific sites on the NMDA receptor and promote its activation, but their role in NMDA-induced neuronal death is ill defined. In this study, we characterized the role of polyamines in excitotoxic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a population of central neurons susceptible to NMDA-induced damage. Our data show that endogenous arginase I, the rate limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, is expressed in the intact, adult retina. Intraocular injection of NMDA visibly increased arginase I expression in Muller cells, the predominant glial cell-type in the mammalian retina. Inhibition of polyamine synthesis using di-fluoro-methyl-ornithine (DFMO) was markedly neuroprotective, while injection of exogenous polyamines in conjunction with NMDA exacerbated RGC death. Blockade of the polyamine binding sites on NMDA receptors using the non-competitive antagonist ifenprodil was neuroprotective, suggesting that polyamines contribute to excitotoxic death, at least partly, by binding to NMDA receptors. Importantly, we also demonstrate that NMDA leads to activation of both the Erk1/2 and PI3 K/Akt pathways, but only the PI3 K/Akt kinase was required for di-fluoro-methyl-ornithine-induced RGC survival. In summary, our study reveals that polyamines modulate neuronal death in the retina via different mechanisms that potentiate NMDA-triggered excitotoxicity.

Given that these PCS are subjective reports and not always specific to concussion, their usefulness remains to be validated. Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of self-reported PCS by means of cognitive tests and functional MRI (fMRI). Method: 28 male athletes with and without concussion were grouped according to their PCS score. They were then administered a computerised cognitive test battery and submitted to an fMRI session where cerebral activations associated with verbal and non-verbal working memory tasks were analysed. Results: Behaviourally, response accuracy and speed on the cognitive test battery were comparable for the control and low PCS group. The moderate PCS group showed significantly slower response times than the control group on the matching (p < 0.05) and one-back tasks (p < 0.05). The functional MRI study showed reduced task related activation patterns in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for both low and moderate PCS groups. Activation peaks outside the regions of interest, not seen in the control group, were also noted for both PCS groups. Regression analyses indicated an inverse relationship between PCS scores and performances on several CogSport subtests. Severity of PCS also predicted fMRI blood oxygen level dependent signal changes in cerebral prefrontal regions. Conclusion: Self-reported PCS is associated with an ongoing cerebral haemodynamic abnormality as well as with mild cognitive impairment. These results support the use of the PCS scale in the assessment of cerebral concussion and in monitoring recovery.

J	Yoshida, M; Alonso, A				Yoshida, Motoharu; Alonso, Angel			Cell-type-specific modulation of intrinsic firing properties and subthreshold membrane oscillations by the m(Kv7)-current in neurons of the Entorhinal cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LAYER-II NEURONS; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SPIKE FREQUENCY ADAPTATION; NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE ENHANCER; POTASSIUM CHANNEL GENE; RECIPROCAL CONNECTIONS; SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; CATION CURRENT; V NEURONS	The M-current (current through Kv7 channels) is a low-threshold noninactivating potassium current that is suppressed by muscarinic agonists. Recent studies have shown its role in spike burst generation and intrinsic subthreshold theta resonance, both of which are important for memory function. However, little is known about its role in principal cells of the entorhinal cortex (EC). In this study, using whole cell patch recording techniques in a rat EC slice preparation, we have examined the effects of the M-current blockers linopirdine and XE991 on the membrane dynamics of principal cells in the EC. When the M-current was blocked, layer II nonstellate cells (non-SCs) and layer III cells switched from tonic discharge to intermittent firing mode, during which layer II non-SCs showed high-frequency short-duration spike bursts due to increased fast spike afterdepolarization (ADP). When three spikes were elicited at 50 Hz, these two types of cells reacted with a slow ADP that drove delayed firing. In contrast, layer II stellate cells (SCs) and layer V cells never displayed intermittent firing, bursting behavior, or delayed firing. Under the M-current block, intrinsic excitability increased significantly in layer III and layer V cells but not in layer II SCs and non-SCs. The M-current block also had contrasting effects on the subthreshold excitability, greatly suppressing the subthreshold membrane potential oscillations in layer V cells but not in layer II SCs. Modulation of the M-current thus shifts the firing behavior, intrinsic excitability, and subthreshold membrane potential oscillations of EC principal cells in a cell-type-dependent manner.

Dendrite-to-soma input/output function of continuous time-varying signals in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							WHITE-NOISE-ANALYSIS; ACTION-POTENTIAL INITIATION; INPUT-OUTPUT TRANSFORMS; VISUAL CORTICAL-NEURONS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; SHUNTING INHIBITION; CONTRAST ADAPTATION; IN-VIVO; SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION; GAIN MODULATION	We examined how hippocamal CA1 neurons process complex time-varying inputs that dendrites are likely to receive in vivo. We propose a functional model of the dendrite-to-soma input/output relationship that combines temporal integration and static-gain control mechanisms. Using simultaneous dual whole cell recordings, we injected 50 s of subthreshold and suprathreshold zero-mean white-noise current into the primary dendritic trunk along the proximal 2/3 of stratum radiatum and measured the membrane potential at the soma. Applying a nonlinear system-identification analysis, we found that a cascade of a linear filter followed by an adapting static-gain term fully accounted for the nonspiking input/output relationship between the dendrite and soma. The estimated filters contained a prominent band-pass region in the 1- to 10-Hz frequency range that remained constant as a function of stimulus variance. The gain of the dendrite-to-soma input/output relationship, in contrast, varied as a function of stimulus variance. When the contribution of the voltage-dependent current I-h was eliminated, the estimated filters lost their band-pass properties and the gain regulation was substantially altered. Our findings suggest that the dendrite-to-soma input/output relationship for proximal apical inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons is well described as a band-pass filter in the theta frequency range followed by a gain-control nonlinearity that dynamically adapts to the statistics of the input signal.

In an exploratory study, we sought to investigate the effect of rapid and sustained changes of emotional state on the trapping of C-11-labelled alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan (C-11-alpha Mtrp) used as a proxy of 5-HT synthesis, using positron emission tomography (PET). Method: In a within-subject repeated-measure design, participants recalled autobiographical memories to self-induce sadness, happiness and a neutral emotional state during scanning to measure brain trapping of C-11-alpha Mtrp. Three separate scan acquisitions, counterbalanced for order across subjects, took place at the McConnell Brain Imaging Center, Montreal. Results: Whole brain analysis revealed positive and negative correlations between experienced levels of emotions and C-11-alpha Mtrp trapping in the right anterior cingulate cortex. Conclusion: These findings point to a mechanism whereby state-related changes in a proxy of 5-HT synthesis underscore aspects of the selfregulation of normal mood.

Bremelanotide is an analogue of the naturally occurring peptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). It stimulates erection in men and male rats, and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Aim. To review the effects of bremelanotide, an analogue of the naturally Occurring peptide alpha-MSH, on the preclinical indices of sexual desire in female rats, and where in the brain these actions may occur. Main Outcome Measures. Appetitive sexual behaviors, such as solicitations, hops and darts, and pacing, were assessed along with consummatory behaviors such as lordosis. The involvement of brain regions was assessed following direct administration to the region, by the stimulation of molecular markers of neural activation, and using microdialysis to examine extracellular fluid for different neurotransmitters. Methods. Using a model that allows ovariectomized, hormone-primed female rats to control the timing of sexual encounters with males, we tested the ability of bremelanotide to increase appetitive (proceptive) and/or consummatory sexual behaviors. Results. Bremelanotide dramatically and selectively increased measures of solicitation in female rats, without altering pacing or lordosis, following both peripheral (subcutaneous) administration or infusions directly into the lateral ventricles or media] preoptic area (mPOA), but not the ventromedial hypothalamus. The mPOA is critical for the display of appetitive sexual behaviors in females and males of a variety of species. Peripheral administration of bremelanotide activates the mPOA and other hypothalamic and limbic regions of the brain involved in sexual behavior, and may work by activating dopamine terminals in the mPOA. Conclusions. To the extent that solicitations indicate the desire of female rats to engage in sexual activity, bremelanotide appears to possess the behavioral, pharmacological, and neuroanatomical specificity required of a drug in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorders.

Materials and Methods: A total of 17 centers worldwide enrolled 163 patients (87% female). Following test stimulation 11 patients declined implantation and 152 underwent implantation using InterStim (R). Of those treated with implantation 96 (63.2%) had urge incontinence, 25 (16.4%) had urgency frequency and 31 (20.4%) had retention. Voiding diaries were collected annually for 5 years. Clinical success was defined as 50% or greater improvement from baseline in primary voiding diary variable(s). Results: Data for all implanted cases were reported. For patients with urge incontinence mean leaking episodes per day decreased from 9.6 +/- 6.0 to 3.9 +/- 4.0 at 5 years. For patients with urgency frequency mean voids per day decreased from 19.3 +/- 7.0 to 14.8 +/- 7.6, and mean volume voided per void increased from 92.3 +/- 52.8 to 165.2 +/- 147.7 ml. For patients with retention the mean volume per catheterization decreased from 379.9 +/- 183.8 to 109.2 +/- 184.3 ml, and the mean number of catheterizations decreased from 5.3 +/- 2.8 to 1.9 +/- 2.8. All changes were statistically significant (p<0.001). No life threatening or irreversible adverse events occurred. In 102 patients 279 device or therapy related adverse events were observed. At 5 years after implantation 68% of patients with urge incontinence, 56% with urgency frequency and 71% with retention had successful outcomes. Conclusions: This long-term study demonstrates that InterStim therapy is safe and effective for restoring voiding in appropriately selected cases refractory to other forms of treatment.

Moderate curves generally are treated using an orthosis. This paper presents different studies performed over the last fifteen years related to the biomechanical evaluation and optimization of the orthopedic treatment of scoliotic deformities. Patient specific 3D models of the spine, pelvis and rib cage are computed from calibrated radiographs, and are used to calculate 2D and 3D clinical indices. The torso shape is acquired using surface topography. With such internal and external 3D models, the efficacy of the most frequently used orthoses can be analyzed and new treatments can be developed. Pressures generated by a brace on the patient's trunk were measured using a flexible matrix of pressure sensors and displayed over the patient's internal geometry in order to analyze the brace efficacy. Patient specific finite element models have been developed, including the osseo-ligamentous structures as well as the muscles, the neuro-control, trunk growth and its adaptation to the stress. These models were used to analyze the effects of the Boston brace. The electro-myographic activity also was measured to analyze the << active >> correction mechanisms. Adjustment techniques and software are used to help the orthotists with real time feedback when the brace is being fabricated and adjusted to the patient. Residual growth potential is also being added to the computer model to simulate the long term effect of a brace. The improvement of the orthotic treatments of scoliotic deformities is very encouraging. The exploitation of such tools is expected to allow reaching optimal treatment personalized to each patient.

Historically, several hypothesis were postulated to explain the aetiology of AIS, including genetic factors, biochemical factors, mechanics, neurological, muscular factors and hormonal factors. The neuroendocrine hypothesis involving a melatonin deficiency as the source for AIS has generated great interest. This hypothesis stems from the fact that experimental pinealectomy in chicken, and more recently in rats maintained in a bipedal mode, produces a scoliosis. The biological relevance of melatonin in idiopathic scoliosis is controversial since no significant decrease in circu-lating melatonin level has been observed in a majority of studies. Analysis of melatonin signal transduction in musculoskeletal tissues of AIS patients demonstrated for the first time a defect occurring in a cell autonomous manner in different cell types isolated from AIS patients suffering of the most severe form of that disease. These results have led to a classification of AIS patients in three different functional groups depending on their response to melatonin, suggesting that the cause of AIS involves several genes. Molecular analysis showed that melatonin signaling dysfunction is triggered by an increased phosphorylation of Gi proteins inactivating their function. This discovery has led to development of a first scoliosis screening assay. This test, using blood sample, is currently in clinical validation process in Canada and could be used for screening children at high risk of developing AIS.

J	Fortin, M; Voss, P; Lassonde, M; Lepore, F				Fortin, Madeleine; Voss, Patrice; Lassonde, Maryse; Lepore, Franco			Sensory loss and brain reorganization	M S-MEDECINE SCIENCES			French	Review							ACTIVATE AUDITORY-CORTEX; ONSET BLIND INDIVIDUALS; CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; HUMANS; DEAFNESS; DISCRIMINATION; LOCALIZATION; ABILITIES; LANGUAGE; CHILDREN	It is without a doubt that humans are first and foremost visual beings. Even though the other sensory modalities provide us with valuable information, it is vision that generally offers the most reliable and detailed information concerning our immediate surroundings. It is therefore not surprising that nearly a third of the human brain processes, in one way or another, visual information. But what happens when the visual information no longer reaches these brain regions responsible for processing it? Indeed numerous medical conditions such as congenital glaucoma, retinis pigmentosa and retinal detachment, to name a few, can disrupt the visual system and lead to blindness. So, do the brain areas responsible for processing visual stimuli simply shut down and become non-functional? Do they become dead weight and simply stop contributing to cognitive and sensory processes? Current data suggests that this is not the case. Quite the contrary, it would seem that congenitally blind individuals benefit from the recruitment of these areas by other sensory modalities to carry out non-visual tasks. In fact, our laboratory has been studying blindness and its consequences on both the brain and behaviour for many years now. We have shown that blind individuals demonstrate exceptional hearing abilities. This finding holds true for stimuli originating from both near and far space. It also holds true, under certain circumstances, for those who lost their sight later in life, beyond a period generally believed to limit the brain changes following the loss of sight. In the case of the early blind, we have shown their ability to localize sounds is strongly correlated with activity in the occipital cortex (the location of the visual processing), demonstrating that these areas are functionally engaged by the task. Therefore it would seem that the plastic nature of the human brain allows them to make new use of the cerebral areas normally dedicated to visual processing.

J	Lassonde, M; Sauerwein, HC				Lassonde, Maryse; Sauerwein, Hannelore C.			Neuropsychology, plasticity and childhood epilepsy	M S-MEDECINE SCIENCES			French	Review							FRONTAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; CALLOSAL AGENESIS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; BRAIN REORGANIZATION; SOUND LOCALIZATION; EARLY CALLOSOTOMY; CHILDREN; ABSENCE; DISCONNECTION; DISCRIMINATION	Epilepsy is one of the most frequent childhood disorders. While most cases are well controlled, approximately 30-50% are resistant to medical treatment. In these cases, neurosurgery may be an option. Since 1979, our team at the Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal has studied the impact of epilepsy on the psycho-motor and cognitive development of the affected children. The aim of a first series of studies was to explore the extent and limits of cerebral plasticity by investigating the neuropsychological sequelae of early versus late callosotomy and hemispherectomy. In keeping with the plasticity hypothesis, the results revealed that the children who were operated before puberty showed fewer deficits than those operated during adolescence or adulthood. However, the compensatory mechanisms available to them appeared to be limited with respect to the nature and complexity of the information they can process. For instance, young children having undergone section of the corpus callosum resembled individuals born without a corpus callosum (callosal agenesis) in that there did not show the typical disconnection deficits seen in adult "split-brain" patients. However, they exhibited deficits on tasks requiring interhemispheric integration of motor and visuo-motor information. By the same token, hemispherectomy patients were still able to make visual judgements in their "blind" visual field but they were found to be impaired on a variety of visual and auditory tasks (localization of a sound sources in space) requiring the participation of both hemispheres. In a second series of studies, carried out in collaboration with a Parisian team, we intended to describe the neuropsychological profile of focal epilepsies, specifically frontal and temporal epilepsy. Contrary to the common belief that childhood epilepsy would result in diffuse impairments, we were able to demonstrate that children manifest the some localized deficits as adult patients. In studies presently underway in our laboratories, we make use of functional neuroimaging techniques such as high density electrophysiology, optical imaging and magnetoencepholography to investigate pre-and postoperative language and memory functions and to study the impact of epilepsy on brain maturation.

J	Sutton, A; Trudeau, N				Sutton, Ann; Trudeau, Natacha			Language development: breaking the code	M S-MEDECINE SCIENCES			French	Review							PERCEPTION	This paper reviews the major achievements of the preschool years regarding language acquisition. Although most children appear to moster their native language with little apparent effort, learning a language is a complex task. It requires the ability to extract clues from environmental stimuli and to discover how those stimuli convey meanings and are modified according to the meaning conveyed. In general, language learning follows a similar sequence regardless of the language being learned. The major accomplishments in the areas of speech perception, early sound production, phonology, lexicon, syntax, and morphology are described, with specific examples from recent studies of acquisition of French in young children from Quebec. These examples confirm major milestones observed in other languages, but also illustrate how comparisons across languages and across children learning the some language can be challenging. For each area, current issues are identified regarding the bases (neurological, genetic) of language development, as well as the processes (social, cognitive, linguistic) involved. Current hypotheses regarding language acquisition and language disorders are briefly discussed.

However, for many life- threatening situations, specific antidotes are not available and treatment is largely based on emptying the stomach, administering activated charcoal or other general measures of intoxication support. A promising strategy for managing such overdoses is to inject nanocarriers that can extract toxic agents from intoxicated tissues. To be effective, the nanocarriers must remain in the blood long enough to sequester the toxic components and/ or their metabolites, and the toxin bound complex must also remain stable until it is removed from the bloodstream. Here, we discuss the principles that govern the use of injectable nanocarriers in biodetoxification and review the pharmacological performance of a number of different approaches.

To test this hypothesis, the dynorphin system was analyzed in postmortem samples from AD and control subjects, and subjects with Parkinson or cerebro-vascular diseases for comparison. Dynorphin A, dynorphin B and related neuropeptide nociceptin were deter-mined in the Brodmann area 7 by radioimmunoassay. The precursor protein prodynorphin, processing convertase PC2 and the neuroendocrine pro7B2 and 7132 proteins required for PC2 maturation were analyzed by Western blot. AD subjects displayed robustly elevated levels of dynorphin A and no differences in dynorphin B and nociceptin compared to controls. Subjects with Parkinson or cerebro-vascular diseases did not differ from controls with respect to any of the three peptides. PC2 levels were also increased, whereas, those of prodynorphin and pro7B2/7B2 were not changed in AD. Dynorphin A levels correlated with the neuritic plaque density. These results along with the known non-opioid ability of dynorphin A to induce neurodegeneration suggest a role for this neuropeptide in AD neuropathology. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of neuro-oncology information for French speaking patients on the Internet	NEUROCHIRURGIE			French	Article						Internet; neuro-oncology; information; patient	WORLD-WIDE-WEB; BRAIN-TUMOR INFORMATION; HEALTH INFORMATION; PROSTATE-CANCER; QUALITY; LANGUAGE; CONSUMERS	Objective. - Internet has become the first place where patients go to when seeking information about their disease. Little is known about the type and the quality of the medical information available on French-speaking websites, especially in the field of neuro-oncology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of these sites. Materials and Methods. - We entered six key words "glioblastome", "meningiome", "metastase cerebrale", "neurinome de l'acoustique", "adenome a prolactine" and "lymphome primitif cerebral" into 2 different search engines and, for each key word, the first fifty websites were reviewed using the tool "DISCERN", and with the help of two neuro-oncologists, we rated their content in terms of quality and comprehension. Results. - On 612 websites only 110 (18%) contained information that proved to be somewhat useful to patients. The average score for quality was 32, which is considered to be "poor". According to our scoring system, 1.8% of websites were found to be "excellent", 11.8% "good", 24.5% "fairly good", 15.4% "average", 32.7% "poor" and 13.6% "very poor". Just over 50% of the websites were found to be clear. The study also showed that the order in which these websites were ranked in the search engine, their affiliation, their target or who financed them had little impact on quality. The websites were more likely to be of high quality if they were managed by doctors and had bibliographical references as well as a date indicating a recent website's update. Discussion and conclusion. - This study shows that the search for medical information on the Internet is time consuming and often disappointing: very few websites provide information that is both clear and exhaustive. However, we also found that very few websites contained information that was seriously inaccurate. Given the growing popularity of the Internet, patients could certainly benefit from a high quality French speaking website that would specialize in cerebral tumors, as well as from a neuro-oncological portal that would take them to selected websites as it would save time and would be a guarantee for quality.

Normal axonal and myelin development of individual white matter tracts of human in this period is poorly understood and may have a major role in cognitive development of human. In this study, we applied diffusion tensor imaging and normalization-based population analyses to 44 preteen children and 30 adult images. We observed highly significant changes of fiber orientations at regions that correspond to the superior longitudinal fasciculus during the first 5 years. The result is attributed to slow axonal and/or myelin maturation of this tract, which is believed to be involved in language functions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, reproducing these data remains controversial. Reasons for the disparity may be the use of different doses, routes, and animal models. We aimed to investigate the effects of peripheral and intracisternal (IQ injection of obestatin on feeding, gastric motility, and blood glucose in rats as well as in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Research Methods and Procedures: Food intake and gastric emptying of a semi-liquid caloric meal were measured after intraperitoneal (IP) injection of obestatin in rats and DID mice. Gastric phasic motility and blood glucose were monitored in urethane-anesthetized rats after IC or intravenous (IV) injection of obestatin. Results: Obestatin injected intraperitoneally at doses ranging from 0. 1 to 3 mg/kg influenced neither acute food intake nor gastric emptying in rats. Obestatin injected intravenously at 0.3 or 3 mg/kg and IC at 7.5 or 30 mu g/rat modified neither fasted gastric phasic motility nor blood glucose levels, while ghrelin (30 mu g/kg, IV) increased and vagotomy suppressed gastric motility, and an oligosomatostatin analog (3 mu g/rat, IQ decreased blood glucose. Obestatin, injected intraperitoneally (0.3 mg/kg) in DID mice, did not alter feeding response to a fast, while urocortin 1 (10 mu g/kg, IP) induced a 73.3 % inhibition at 2 hours. Discussion: Our data demonstrate that peripheral administration of obestatin did not modify food intake in rats or obese mice or gastric motor function in rats.

Spinal cord stimulation versus conventional medical management for neuropathic pain: A multicentre randomised controlled trial in patients with failed back surgery syndrome	PAIN			English	Article							EPIDEMIOLOGY; CHALLENGES; INDEX; SF-36	Patients with neuropathic pain secondary to failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) typically experience persistent pain, disability, and reduced quality of life. We hypothesised that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective therapy in addition to conventional medical management (CMM) in this patient population. We randomised 100 FBSS patients with predominant leg pain of neuropathic radicular origin to receive spinal cord stimulation plus conventional medical management (SCS group) or conventional medical management alone (CMM group) for at least 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving 50% or more pain relief in the legs. Secondary outcomes were improvement in back and leg pain, health-related quality of life, functional capacity, use of pain medication and non-drug pain treatment, level of patient satisfaction, and incidence of complications and adverse effects. Crossover after the 6-months visit was permitted, and all patients were followed up to I year. In the intention-to-treat analysis at 6 months, 24 SCS patients (48%) and 4 CMM patients (9%) (p < 0.001) achieved the primary outcome. Compared with the CMM group, the SCS group experienced improved leg and back pain relief, quality of life, and functional capacity, as well as greater treatment satisfaction (p <= 0.05 for all comparisons). Between 6 and 12 months, 5 SCS patients crossed to CMM, and 32 CMM patients crossed to SCS. At 12 months, 27 SCS patients (32%) had experienced device-related complications. In selected patients with FBSS, SCS provides better pain relief and improves health-related quality of life and functional capacity compared with CMM alone.

Current definitions of hypotension do not predict abnormal cranial ultrasound findings in preterm infants	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						blood pressure; hypotension; cranial; ultrasound; prematurity; GM-IVH	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS SYNDROME; HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC INJURY; INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGE; PERIVENTRICULAR LEUKOMALACIA; PREMATURE-INFANTS; NEWBORN-INFANT; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; PRESSURE RANGES	OBJECTIVE. Hypotension is a commonly treated complication of prematurity, although definitions and management guidelines vary widely. Our goal was to examine the relationship between current definitions of hypotension and early abnormal cranial ultrasound findings. METHODS. We prospectively measured mean arterial pressure in 84 infants who were <= 30 weeks' gestational age and had umbilical arterial catheters in the first 3 days of life. Sequential 5-minute epochs of continuous mean arterial pressure recordings were assigned a mean value and a coefficient of variation. We applied to our data 3 definitions of hypotension in current clinical use and derived a hypotensive index for each definition. We examined the association between these definitions of hypotension and abnormal cranial ultrasound findings between days 5 and 10. In addition, we evaluated the effect of illness severity ( Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology II) on cranial ultrasound findings. RESULTS. Acquired lesions as shown on cranial ultrasound, present in 34 ( 40%) infants, were not predicted by any of the standard definitions of hypotension or by mean arterial pressure variability. With hypotension defined as mean arterial pressure < 10th percentile ( < 33 mm Hg) for our overall cohort, mean value for mean arterial pressure and hypotensive index predicted abnormal ultrasound findings but only in infants who were >= 27 weeks' gestational age and those with lower illness severity scores. CONCLUSIONS. Hypotension as diagnosed by currently applied thresholds for preterm infants is not associated with brain injury on early cranial ultrasounds. Blood pressure management directed at these population-based thresholds alone may not prevent brain injury in this vulnerable population.

Inhaled nitric oxide for preterm infants: A systematic review	PEDIATRICS			English	Review						inhaled nitric oxide; preterm infants; systematic review	RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS-SYNDROME; BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PREMATURE-INFANTS; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; PULMONARY-HYPERTENSION; FAILURE; DISEASE; VENTILATION; INHALATION	OBJECTIVE. Our goal was to determine whether, for preterm newborn infants with respiratory disease, inhaled nitric oxide reduced the rates of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intracranial hemorrhage, or neurodevelopmental disability. METHODS. We searched Medline, Embase, Healthstar, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the search terms "nitric oxide," " clinical trial," and "newborn" and covering 1985-2006. We also searched abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies. RESULTS. Eleven randomized, controlled trials of inhaled nitric oxide therapy for preterm infants were found. The trials were grouped into 3 categories according to the entry criteria, that is, entry in the first 3 days of life on the basis of oxygenation criteria ( early rescue), enrollment after 3 days on the basis of elevated risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and routine use for intubated preterm infants. Early rescue treatment based on oxygenation criteria did not seem to affect mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates. Routine use for intubated preterm infants showed a barely significant reduction in the incidence of the combined outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( relative risk [ RR]: 0.91 [ 95% confidence limits ( CLs): 0.84, 0.99]). Later treatment based on the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia showed no significant effect on this outcome. Early rescue treatment showed a trend toward increased incidence of severe intracranial hemorrhage, whereas routine use for intubated preterm infants seemed to show a reduction in the incidence of either severe intracranial hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia ( RR: 0.70 [ 95% CLs: 0.53, 0.91]). CONCLUSIONS. Inhaled nitric oxide as rescue therapy for very ill preterm infants undergoing ventilation does not seem to be effective and may increase severe intracranial hemorrhage. Later use of inhaled nitric oxide to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia does not seem to be effective. Early routine use of inhaled nitric oxide for mildly sick, preterm infants seems to decrease the risk of serious brain injury and may improve rates of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

As genetic heterogeneity in drug targets can influence drug response, we sought to further evaluate the contribution of CYP2D6 to pharmacodynamic sensitivity in our previous study sample in tandem with DRD2, the primary molecular target for perphenazine. Methods: Genotyping for DRD2 Taq1 A, -141 C ins/del and Ser311 Cys functional polymorphisms was performed using PCR-restriction-fragment length polymorphism methods. Results: After controlling for DRD2 polymorphisms, CYP2D6 was a significant predictor of pituitary pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity to perphenazine (P=0.024; power=80.4%). Taq1A polymorphism significantly influenced the time course of prolactin response (P=0.039; power=70%). A1/A1 genotype displayed a higher prolactin elevation 2 h after perphenazine administration (P= 0.02). Patients with -141 C ins/ins genotype showed a strong trend toward a 38% larger prolactin AUC compared with the -141 C ins/del genotypic group (P=0.07). Conclusions: CYP2D6 seems to be an independent contributor to pituitary pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity to perphenazine after accounting for DRD2 functional polymorphisms. The Al allele of the Taq1A polymorphism was previously shown to decrease D2 receptor density in vitro and in neuroimaging studies in vivo. At a given antipsychotic dose, individuals with All allele might thus achieve a higher DRD2 antipsychotic occupancy, which is consistent with an increased prolactin elevation in the A1/A1 genotype in this study. These findings provide a basis for further studies on the endogenous substrates of CYP2D6 and the rational selection of candidate genes for long-term consequences of anti psychotic-induced hyperprolactinernia (e.g. susceptibility to breast and prostate cancers).

France has developed official guidelines for the use of triptans as port of migraine management. This pharmacoepidemiological study sought to evaluate how naratriptan is prescribed and used in community medicine in France. Methods The protocol called for general practitioners to be randomly selected from a list of all physicians in France and for each to include two patients with migraine. Data come from questionnai res completed by the physician and by the patient (including HIT-6 and QVM to assess headache impact and quality of life) as well as a patient diary. Results In all, 2530 physicians included 3863 patients: 54.3% were treated with naratriptan, 22.4% with another triptan and 23.3% with a non-triptan medication. Of the patients receiving naratriptran, 82.3% were women. Migraine impact was greater and quality of life worse in the patients receiving triptans than those treated with other medications (p < 0.0001). Naratriptan was prescribed as second-line treatment following failure Of On NSAID in 44.2% of patients taking it. 55.3% of them were prescribed 0 single dose per headache. Overall, initial treatment was token right at the beginning of the migraine attack in 70.5% of headaches. Discussion Data from this cross-sectional study indicate that triptans in general and naratriptan in particular ore most often prescribed for patients with the most severe migraines. Consistent with official French guidelines, physicians often recommend taking naratriptan after and only if G NSAID foils to provide relief Nonetheless, one patient in three starts treatment late, which may significantly reduce the efficacy rote, increase the risk of recurrence and side effects, and prolong the headache, Conclusion Naratriptan is generally prescribed in accordance with official guidelines. Delay in taking medication by around one third of patients probably reduces its efficacy.

Time delay between viewing the crime and completing the ERP-lineup (no- delay, 1-h delay and 1-week delay conditions) and culprit presence or absence were also manipulated. Results demonstrated that a P300 provided a reliable index of recognition of the culprit relative to the other lineup members across all time delay conditions. Although participants' accuracy decreased at the 1-week time delay compared to no delay and the 1-h time delay, the P300 effect remained strong for participants that made correct identifications irrespective of the time delay. In addition, the P300 was attenuated or was not elicited when the culprit was absent from the lineup.

The effect of gender on autonomic and respiratory responses during sleep among both young and middle-aged subjects	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						autonomic nervous system; sleep; gender; age; RR variability; respiration	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SYMPATHETIC-NERVE ACTIVITY; POWER SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; REM-SLEEP; CARDIOVASCULAR VARIABILITY; STRESS; SENSITIVITY; MODULATION; HORMONES	Background and objectives: Sleep affects the control of circulation and respiratory function. Gender and age are also known to have a profound impact on the neural control of circulation. We investigated whether gender affects sleep-related cardiovascular and respiratory responses and whether these vary according to healthy subjects being young or middle-aged. Methods: We studied 32 subjects: 8 women and 8 men aged 20-30 years (young), and 8 women and 8 men aged 50-60 years (middle-aged). Young women were under oral contraceptive therapy and middle-aged women were postmenopausal and not receiving hormonal replacement therapy. One-night polysomnography was used to assess RR variability during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (stage 2) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components, in normalized units (LFnu and HFnu) and LF/HF ratio were calculated on five-minute segments selected across the night and averaged for each sleep stage. The respiration frequency in NREM and REM sleep was also measured. Interaction between gender, age and sleep on autonomic and respiration variables was assessed by 2 x 2 x 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Compared to men, women had a greater NREM-to-REM increment in LFnu (gender-by-state interaction, p < 0.01), a greater decrement in HFnu (interaction, p < 0.01) and a greater increment in LF/HF (interaction, p < 0.05). Women also showed a more pronounced increase in respiratory frequency during REM sleep compared to men in both groups of age (gender-by-state interaction. F = 7.1, p < 0.05). No gender-by-age-by-state interaction was observed to affect autonomic and respiration variables. Conclusion: NREM-to-REM excitatory cardiac and respiratory responses are more marked among women compared to men, regardless of their hormonal status and whether they are young or middle-aged.

It stems from the interactions of four researchers involved in basic and clinical research who presented their work at a dedicated Symposium of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego. After SCI, primary and secondary damage occurs and several endogenous processes are triggered that may foster or hinder axonal reconnection from supralesional structures. Studies in animals show that some of these processes can be enhanced or decreased by exogenous interventions using drugs to diminish repulsive barriers (anti- Nogo, anti- Rho) that prevent regeneration and/or sprouting of axons. Cell grafts are also envisaged to enhance beneficial immunological mechanisms ( autologous macrophages, vaccines) or remyelinate axons (oligodendrocytes derived from stem cells). Some of these treatments could be planned concurrently with neurosurgical approaches that are themselves beneficial to decrease secondary damage ( e. g., decompression/reconstructive spinal surgery). Finally, rehabilitative approaches based on the presence of functional networks (i. e., central pattern generator) below the lesion combined with the above neurobiological approaches may produce significant functional recovery of some sensorimotor functions, such as locomotion, by ensuring an optimal function of endogenous spinal networks and establishing new dynamic interactions with supralesional structures. More work is needed on all fronts, but already the results offer great hope for functional recovery after SCI based on sound basic and clinical neuroscience research.

As an illustration, we shall focus on two different kinases associated with recessive and dominant forms of PD. Mutations in the mitochondrial kinase PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin homolog)induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are loss-of-function mutations in a normally neuroprotective protein. Loss-of-function mutations in model organisms have variable effects, from dramatic muscle and spermatid defects in Drosophila to more subtle neurophysiological abnormalities in mice. Several lines of evidence relate these to the action of a second gene for familial PD, parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase shown recently to have effects on Akt signaling. Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a cytosolic kinase, are dominant and have the opposite effect of causing neuronal damage. The mechanism(s) involved are uncertain at this time because LRRK2 is a large and complex molecule with several domains. Increased kinase activity accounts for the action of at least some of the mutations, suggesting that hyperactive or misregulated kinase activity may lead to the damaging effects of LRRK2 in neurons. For both PINK1 and LRRK2, the following key question that needs to be answered: what are the physiological substrates that mediate effects in cells? Here, we will discuss some of the recent thinking about physiological and pathological roles for signaling in PD and how these may have therapeutic implications for the future.

We measured the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to overt sentence reading in: (1) 9 treated female patients with mild to moderate PD (age; mean 66.0 +/- 11.6 years, mean levodopa equivalent 583.3 +/- 397.9 mg) and (2) 8 age-matched healthy female controls (age; mean 62.2 years +/- 12.3). Speech was recorded in the scanner to assess which brain regions underlie variations in the initiation and paralinguistic aspects (e.g., pitch, loudness, and rate) of speech production in the two groups. There were no differences in paralinguistic aspects of speech except for speech loudness; it was lower in PD patients compared with that in controls, when age was used as a covariate. In both groups, we observed increases in the BOLD response (reading-baseline) in brain regions involved in speech production and perception. In PD patients, as compared with controls, we found significantly higher BOLD signal in the right primary orofacial sensorimotor cortex and more robust correlations between the measured speech parameters and the BOLD response to reading, particularly, in the left primary orofacial sensorimotor cortex.

This surgical technique is being studied as alternative for PD patients who are considered poor candidates for deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus (STN). In 4 PD patients with unilateral MCS, we used [O-15] H2O positron emission tomography to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) while testing motor performance with a joystick motor task during different stimulation frequencies, OFF-condition, 50 and 130 Hz. We found that different stimulation settings did neither improve performance on joystick task nor modify the pattern of movement-related rCBF. Similarly, no changes were observed in UPDRS motor score between Off and On stimulation while off medication. We conclude that while MCS may be a simpler and safer surgical procedure than DBS of STN, it failed to provide evidence of clear effect on motor performance and movement-related activation pattern in patients with advanced PD.

Developmental expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors underlies depolarization-induced long-term depression at mossy fiber-CA3 pyramid Synapses	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						LTD; GluR2; mossy fiber; hippocampus; synapse development; calcium	CALCIUM-PERMEABLE AMPA; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; SILENT SYNAPSES; INTRACELLULAR POLYAMINES; NMDA RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; BIDIRECTIONAL PLASTICITY; STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS	Many central excitatory synapses undergo developmental alterations in the molecular and biophysical characteristics of postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors via changes in subunit composition. Concerning AMPA receptors (AMPARs), glutamate receptor 2 subunit (GluR2)-containing, Ca2+ -impermeable AMPARs (CI-AMPARs) prevail at synapses between mature principal neurons; however, accumulating evidence indicates that GluR2-lacking, Ca2+ permeable AMPARs(CP-AMPARs) contribute at these synapses early in development. Here, we used a combination of imaging and electrophysiological recording techniques to investigate potential roles for CP-AMPARs at developing hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell (MF-PYR) synapses. We found that transmission at nascent MF-PYR synapses is mediated by a mixed population of CP- and CI-AMPARs as evidenced by polyamine-dependent inwardly rectifying current-voltage (I-V) relationships, and partial philanthotoxin sensitivity of synaptic events. CP-AMPAR expression at MF-PYR synapses is transient, being limited to the first 3 postnatal weeks. Moreover, the expression of CP- AMPARs is regulated by the PDZ ( postsynaptic density-95/ Discs large/zona occludens-1) domain-containing protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1), because MF-PYR synapses in young PICK1 knock-out mice are philanthotoxin insensitive with linear I-V relationships. Strikingly, MF-PYR transmission via CP- AMPARs is selectively depressed during depolarization-induced long-term depression (DiLTD), a postsynaptic form of MF-PYR plasticity observed only at young MF-PYR synapses. The selective depression of CP- AMPARs during DiLTD was evident as a loss of postsynaptic CP- AMPAR-mediated Ca2+ transients in PYR spines and reduced rectification of MF-PYR synaptic currents. Preferential targeting of CP- AMPARs during DiLTD is further supported by a lack of DiLTD in young PICK1 knock-out mice. Together, these findings indicate that the transient participation of CP- AMPARs at young MF-PYR synapses dictates the developmental window to observe DiLTD.

The action of CB1R agonists on the serotonin (5-HT) system, the major transmitter system involved in mood control and implicated in the mechanism of action of antidepressants, remains however poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that, at low doses, the CB1R agonist WIN55,212-2 [R(+)-[2,3-dihydro- 5-methyl- 3[( morpholinyl)] pyrrolo[ 1,2,3-de]- 1,4-benzoxazinyl]-(1-naphthalenyl) methanone mesylate] exerts potent antidepressant-like properties in the rat forced-swim test (FST). This effect isCB(1)R dependent because it was blocked by the CB1R antagonist rimonabant and is 5-HT mediated because it was abolished by pretreatment with the 5-HT-depleting agent parachlorophenylalanine. Then, using in vivo electrophysiology, we showed that low doses of WIN55,212-2 dose dependently enhanced dorsal raphe nucleus 5-HT neuronal activity through a CB1R-dependent mechanism. Conversely, high doses of WIN55,212-2 were ineffective in the FST and decreased 5-HT neuronal activity through a CB1R-independent mechanism. The CB1R agonist-induced enhancement of 5-HT neuronal activity was abolished by total or medial prefrontocortical, but not by lateral prefrontocortical, transection. Furthermore, 5-HT neuronal activity was enhanced by the local microinjection of WIN55,212-2 into the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mPFCv) but not by the local microinjection of WIN55,212-2 into the lateral prefrontal cortex. Similarly, the microinjection of WIN55,212-2 into the mPFCv produced a CB1R-dependent antidepressantlike effect in the FST. These results demonstrate that CB1R agonists possess antidepressant-like properties and modulate 5-HT neuronal activity via the mPFCv.

Reversible interactions between smooth domains of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria are regulated by physiological cytosolic Ca2+ levels	JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE			English	Article						endoplasmic reticulum domains; mitochondria; free cytosolic calcium; AMFR; IP3R	MOTILITY FACTOR-RECEPTOR; INOSITOL 1,4,5-TRISPHOSPHATE RECEPTORS; UBIQUITIN PROTEIN LIGASE; CALCIUM SIGNAL; HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION; RYANODINE-RECEPTORS; PURKINJE NEURONS; CELLS; MEMBRANE; RELEASE	The 3F3A monoclonal antibody to autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) labels mitochondria-associated smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules. siRNA down regulation of AMFR expression reduces mitochondria-associated 3F3A labelling. The 3F3A-labelled ER domain does not overlap with reticulon-labelled ER tubules, the nuclear membrane or perinuclear ER markers and only partially overlaps with the translocon component Sec61 alpha. Upon overexpression of FLAG-tagged AMFR, 3F3A labelling is mitochondria associated, excluded from the perinuclear ER and co-distributes with reticulon. 3F3A labelling therefore defines a distinct mitochondria-associated ER domain. Elevation of free cytosolic Ca2+ levels with ionomycin promotes dissociation of 3F3A-labelled tubules from mitochondria and, judged by electron microscopy, disrupts close contacts (< 50 nm) between smooth ER tubules and mitochondria. The ER tubule-mitochondria association is similarly disrupted upon thapsigargin-induced release of ER Ca2+ stores or purinergic receptor stimulation by ATP. The inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate [ Ins(1,4,5) P-3] receptor (IP3R) colocalises to 3F3A-labelled mitochondria-associated ER tubules, and conditions that induce ER tubule-mitochondria dissociation disrupt continuity between 3F3A-and IP3R-labelled ER domains. RAS-transformed NIH-3T3 cells have increased basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels and show dissociation of the 3F3A-labelled, but not IP3R-labelled, ER from mitochondria. Our data indicate that regulation of the ER-mitochondria association by free cytosolic Ca2+ is a characteristic of smooth ER domains and that multiple mechanisms regulate the interaction between these organelles.

Health-related quality of life in adult survivors of childhood Wilms tumor or neuroblastoma: A report from the childhood cancer survivor study	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						health-related quality of life; neuroblastoma; survivorship; Wilms tumor	BONE-MARROW-TRANSPLANTATION; POOR-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA; TOTAL-BODY IRRADIATION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; CHILDREN; OUTCOMES; THERAPY; GROWTH; SF-36; COMPLICATIONS	Background Long-term survivors of Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma may experience significant late adverse effects from their disease and its therapy. Little is known, however, about the health-related quality of life experienced by these survivors. Procedure. Health-related quality of life, measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), was assessed from self-report in adult survivors of Wilms tumor (N = 654) and neuroblastoma (N = 432) who participated in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Results. More than 90% of the study population was 18-34 years old at interview, and 58% were females. There was no significant difference on any SF-36 subscale or summary scale between the two diagnostic groups. On average, survivors reported no decrement on the Physical Component Summary scale of the SF-36 when compared to population norms. However, both groups scored significantly below the population mean score (50) on the Mental Component Summary Scale of the SF-36 (Wilms tumor mean=41.66, standard error = 2.19, P<0.0001; neuroblastoma mean = 42.41, standard error = 2.23, P<0.0001) reflecting decreased emotional health. Independent risk factors for lower scores on this scale included female gender, Native American race, unemployment, and household income below $20,000. Conclusions. Adult survivors of childhood Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma do not differ from Population norms on most health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures. These data, however, indicate that the emotional well being of adult survivors may be compromised. Health care providers should be aware of the risk of adverse outcomes in emotional health even many years after treatment and cure.

Recent studies have shown that pure trigeminal stimulation activates somatosensory regions as well as regions traditionally thought of as primary olfactory areas. As a main aim of this study we wished to a) ascertain which brain regions are responsive to an "artificially" bimodal odor composed of a trigeminal (CO2) and an olfactory stimulant (phenyl ethyl alcohol, PEA) and b) determine if presenting CO2 and PEA simultaneously activates different brain regions than when presenting them individually. Fifteen men were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while smelling PEA, CO2, and a mixture of both Stimuli (CO(2)PEA) presented simultaneously. Odors were presented monorhinally to the right nostril in a block design. The contrast between CO(2)PEA and baseline revealed areas implicated in the processing of both olfactory and trigeminal stimuli. When the mixture was contrasted with the sum of its single components (CO(2)PEA-{CO2+PEA}), activations in integration centers (left superior temporal and right intraparietal sulcus) and in orbitofrontal areas (left medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex) were detected. The opposite contrast ({CO2+PEA}-CO(2)PEA) did not reveal any significant activation. In contrast to studies which have used natural mixed olfactory/trigerninal stimuli, we have shown that the perception of an artificial mixed olfactory/trigerninal stimulus activates, as opposed to inhibiting the olfactory cortex. Further, we also conclude that a mixed olfactory/ trigeminal stimulus appears to lead to higher cortical activations than the sum of its parts. (c) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Factors that guide developing axons are known for various pathways throughout the mammalian brain; however, signals necessary to establish auditory connections are largely unknown. In the auditory brainstem the neurons whose axons traverse the midline in the ventral acoustic stria (VAS) are primarily located in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) and project bilaterally to the superior olivary complex (SOC). The circumferential trajectory taken by developing VCN axons is similar to that of growing axons of spinal commissural neurons. Therefore, we reasoned that netrin-DCC and slit-robo, signaling systems function in the guidance of VCN axons. VCN neurons express the transcription factor, wmafB, as early as embryonic day (E) 13.5, thereby identifying the embryonic VCN for these studies. VCN axons extend toward the midline as early as E13, with many axons crossing by E14.5. During this time, netrin-1 and slit-1 RNAs are expressed at the brainstem midline. Additionally, neurons within the VCN express RNA for DCC, robo-1, and robo-2, and axons in the VAS are inummoreactive for DCC. VCN axons do not reach the midline of the brainstem in mice mutant for either the netrin-1 or DCC gene. VCN axons extend in pups lacking netrin-1, but most DCC-mutant samples lack VCN axonal outgrowth. Stereological cell estimates indicate only a modest reduction of VCN neurons in DCC-mutant mice. Taken together, these data show that a functional netrin-DCC signaling system is required for establishing proper VCN axonal projections in the auditory brainstem.

Changes in dopaminergic tone can have strong effects on basal evoked synaptic responses in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex, and the current study investigated whether dopamine may modulate the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) in piriform cortex inputs to layer 11 of the lateral entorhinal cortex in awake rats. Groups of animals were pretreated with either saline or the selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR 12909 prior to low or high frequency stimulation to induce LTD or Up. In saline-treated groups, synaptic responses were potentiated to 122.4 +/- 6.4% of baseline levels following UP induction, and were reduced to 84.5 +/- 4.9% following induction of LTD. Changes in synaptic responses were maintained for up to 60 min and returned to baseline levels within 24 h. In contrast, induction of both UP and LTD was blocked in rats pretreated with GBR 12909. Dopaminergic suppression of synaptic plasticity in the entorhinal cortex may serve to restrain activity-dependent plasticity during reward-relevant behavioral states or during processing of novel stimuli.

These individuals are also more impulsive and impaired in working memory and attention. The current study tested whether SDI show altered temporal processing in relation to impulsivity or impaired prefrontal cortex functioning. We employed a series of timing tasks aimed to examine time processing from the milliseconds to multiple seconds range and assessed cognitive function in 15 male SDI and 15 stimulant-naive individuals. A mediation analysis determined the degree to which impulsivity or executive dysfunctions contributed to group differences in time processing. SDI showed several abnormal time processing characteristics. SDI needed larger time differences for effective duration discrimination, particularly for intervals of around 1 s. SDI also accelerated finger tapping during a continuation period after a 1 Hz pacing stimulus was removed. In addition, SDI overestimated the duration of a relatively long time interval, an effect which was attributable to higher impulsivity. Taken together, these data show for the first time that SDI exhibit altered time processing in several domains, one which can be explained by increased impulsivity. Altered time processing in SDI could explain why SDI have difficulty delaying gratification. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Molecular genetic studies of DMT1 on 12q in French-Canadian restless legs syndrome patients and families	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B-NEUROPSYCHIATRIC GENETICS			English	Article						restless legs syndrome; DMT1; association; anemia; linkage	HEPATIC IRON OVERLOAD; MICROCYTIC ANEMIA; BRAIN IRON; SENSORY SYMPTOMS; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHM; BELGRADE RAT; POPULATION; MUTATION; CONFIRMATION; FERRITIN	Converging evidence from clinical observations, brain imaging and pathological findings strongly indicate impaired brain iron regulation in restless legs syndrome (RLS). Animal models with mutation in (DMT1) divalent metal transporter 1 gene, an important brain iron transporter, demonstrate a similar iron deficiency profile as found in RLS brain. The human DMT1 gene, mapped to chromosome 12q near the RLS1 locus, qualifies as an excellent functional and possible positional candidate for RLS. DMT1 protein levels were assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines from RLS patients and controls. Linkage analyses were carried out with markers flanking and within the DMT1 gene. Selected patient samples from RLS families with compatible linkage to the RLS1 locus on 12q were fully sequenced in both the coding regions and the long stretches of UTR sequences. Finally, selected sequence variants were further studied in case/control and family-based association tests. A clinical association of anemia and RLS was further confirmed in this study. There was no detectable difference in DMT1 protein levels between RLS patient lymphoblastoid cell lines and normal controls. Non-parametric linkage analyses failed to identify any significant linkage signals within the DMT1 gene region. Sequencing of selected patients did not detect any sequence variant(s) compatible with DMT1 harboring RLS causative mutation(s). Further studies did not find any association between ten SNPs, spanning the whole DMT1 gene region, and RLS affection status. Finally, two DMT1 intronic SNPs showed positive association with RLS in patients with a history of anemia, when compared to RLS patients without anemia. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Surprisingly, however, the structural status of glutamatergic synapses in Alzheimer's disease is unclear, despite the fact that glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter of the CNS and has key roles in excitotoxicity and long-term potentiation. The identification of specific markers of glutamatergic neurons now allows an assessment of the structural involvement of the glutamatergic system across progressive stages of the Alzheimer's pathology, an opportunity not afforded by previously used neurochemical approaches. Glutamatergic presynaptic bouton density and dystrophic neurite abundance were quantified in midfrontal gyrus brain tissue from subjects with no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or mild- or severe-stage Alzheimer's disease. Our study demonstrates a striking pathology-dependent pattern of glutamatergic synaptic remodeling with disease progression. Subjects with mild cognitive impairment display a paradoxical elevation in glutamatergic presynaptic bouton density, a situation akin to that observed in the cholinergic system, which then depletes and drops with disease progression. This pattern of synaptic remodeling mirrors our previous findings in transgenic animal models and is of major relevance to current transmitter-based therapeutics.

J	Desy, MC; Theoret, H				Desy, Marie-Christine; Theoret, Hugo			Modulation of Motor Cortex Excitability by Physical Similarity with an Observed Hand Action	PLOS ONE			English	Article								The passive observation of hand actions is associated with increased motor cortex excitability, presumably reflecting activity within the human mirror neuron system (MNS). Recent data show that in-group ethnic membership increases motor cortex excitability during observation of culturally relevant hand gestures, suggesting that physical similarity with an observed body part may modulate MNS responses. Here, we ask whether the MNS is preferentially activated by passive observation of hand actions that are similar or dissimilar to self in terms of sex and skin color. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials were recorded from the first dorsal interosseus muscle while participants viewed videos depicting index finger movements made by female or male participants with black or white skin color. Forty-eight participants equally distributed in terms of sex and skin color participated in the study. Results show an interaction between self-attributes and physical attributes of the observed hand in the right motor cortex of female participants, where corticospinal excitability is increased during observation of hand actions in a different skin color than that of the observer. Our data show that specific physical properties of an observed action modulate motor cortex excitability and we hypothesize that in-group/out-group membership and self-related processes underlie these effects.

A quantitative trait locus for variation in dopamine metabolism mapped in a primate model using reference sequences from related species	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						comparative genomics; genetic mapping; homovanillic acid; vervet	GENETIC-LINKAGE MAP; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID MONOAMINE; CHLOROCEBUS-AETHIOPS-SABAEUS; HUMAN MICROSATELLITE LOCI; PAPIO-HAMADRYAS GENOME; HOMOVANILLIC-ACID; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SOCIAL IMPULSIVITY; GENERAL PEDIGREES; MACACA-MULATTA	Non-human primates (NHP) provide crucial research models. Their strong similarities to humans make them particularly valuable for understanding complex behavioral traits and brain structure and function. We report here the genetic mapping of an NHP nervous system biologic trait, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of the clopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA), in an extended inbred vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) pedigree. CSF HVA is an index of CNS dopamine activity, which is hypothesized to contribute substantially to behavioral variations in NHP and humans. For quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, we carried out a two-stage procedure. We first scanned the genome using a first-generation genetic map of short tandem repeat markers. Subsequently, using >100 SNPs within the most promising region identified by the genome scan, we mapped a QTL for CSF HVA at a genome-wide level of significance (peak logarithm of odds score >4) to a narrow well delineated interval (<10 Mb). The SNP discovery exploited conserved segments between human and rhesus macaque reference genome sequences. Our findings demonstrate the potential of using existing primate reference genome sequences for designing high-resolution genetic analyses applicable across a wide range of NHP species, including the many for which full genome sequences are not yet available. Leveraging genomic information from sequenced to nonsequenced species should enable the utilization of the full range of NHP diversity in behavior and disease susceptibility to determine the genetic basis of specific biological and behavioral traits.

Hypomorphic CEP290/NPHP6 mutations result in anosmia caused by the selective loss of G proteins in cilia of olfactory sensory neurons	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						nephrocystin; olfaction	ODORANT RECEPTORS; INTRAFLAGELLAR TRANSPORT; RETINITIS-PIGMENTOSA; CENTROSOMAL PROTEIN; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; JOUBERT-SYNDROME; TRANSITION ZONE; EXCHANGE FACTOR; MICE; NEPHROCYSTIN-4	Cilia regulate diverse functions such as motility, fluid balance, and sensory perception. The cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) compartmentalize the signaling proteins necessary for odor detection; however, little is known regarding the mechanisms of protein sorting/entry into olfactory cilia. Nephrocystins are a family of ciliary proteins likely involved in cargo sorting during transport from the basal body to the ciliary axoneme. In humans, loss-of-function of the cilia-centrosomal protein CEP290/NPHP6 is associated with Joubert and Meckel syndromes, whereas hypomorphic mutations result in Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a form of early-onset retinal dystrophy. Here, we report that CEP290-LCA patients exhibit severely abnormal olfactory function. In a mouse model with hypomorphic mutations in CEP290 [retinal dystrophy-16 mice (rd16)], electro-olfactogram recordings revealed an anosmic phenotype analogous to that of CEP290-LCA patients. Despite the loss of olfactory function, cilia of OSNs remained intact in the rd16 mice. As in wild type, CEP290 localized to dendritic knobs of rd16 OSNs, where it was in complex with ciliary transport proteins and the olfactory G proteins G(olf) and G(gamma 13). Interestingly, we observed defective ciliary localization of G(olf) and G(gamma 13) but not of G protein-coupled odorant receptors or other components of the odorant signaling pathway in the rd16 OSNs. Our data implicate distinct mechanisms for ciliary transport of olfactory signaling proteins, with CEP290 being a key mediator involved in G protein trafficking. The assessment of olfactory function can, therefore, serve as a useful diagnostic tool for genetic screening of certain syndromic ciliary diseases.

There are currently no universally accepted biological or radiological markers of dementia. In the absence of these, the diagnosis of dementia remains a clinical exercise aiming to integrate all available clinical and laboratory information. It is proposed that the currently used National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRA) criteria for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) be retained. The currently available vascular dementia (VaD) diagnostic criteria have variable accuracy. An integrative approach to VaD diagnosis based on all the available evidence (history, vascular risk factors, physical exam, clinical course, neuroimaging, cognitive impairment pattern) is recommended. The separation of Lewy body dementia (DLB) from Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is based on the dominant clinical presenting feature of each syndrome, and relies on the duration of this feature: long duration of parkinsonian "motor" syndrome preceding dementia for PDD versus early/initial dementia accompanied by extrapyramidal symptoms for DLB. It is recognized that it is impossible clinically to characterize DLB with (pathologically) coexisting AD changes. The Frontotemporal group of dementia syndromes are discussed in regards to their typical clinical pictures, recognizing that their neuropathological substrate are not predictable from their mode of presentation. Finally, the particular rapid time sequence of evolution of the dementias due to prior disease is recognized as the clinically most useful distinguishing feature of these syndromes.

Methods: A search of English language medical databases was performed from 1996 to the present for articles pertaining to the management of AD. The focus of this review was on studies that included patients with severe disease. Studies were assessed by considering the subjects, trial design, analysis, and results. Recommendations were based on the best available evidence. Results: Severe AD can be defined and diagnosed reliably by using measures of cognition, function, behavior, and global staging. Specific assessments would also include medical status, safety issues, and the health status of the caregiver. Disease-specific management would include treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms begins with nonpharmacologic behavioral and environmental approaches. Severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis that are potentially dangerous to the patient, caregiver, and others in the environment can be treated with atypical antipsychotics, with consideration of their increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality. All pharmacologic approaches require careful monitoring and regular periodic reassessments to determine whether ongoing treatment is necessary. Conclusions: Evidence-based guidelines for the management of severe AD have the potential to improve the quality of life for the patient and their caregiver. More randomized controlled trials aimed specifically at this phase of illness are still urgently required. (c) 2007 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.

There was consensus that many of the features proposed as essential to a diagnosis of dementia in the 1980s no longer are relevant (for example, the requirements for memory impairment, electroencephalogram and cerebrospinal fluid studies, age-specific exclusions). In addition, other syndromes such as frontotemporal dementia have been recognized and need to inform new dementia criteria. It is also recognized that a diagnosis of depression need not exclude a dementia diagnosis. Other proposals, such as neuropathology should be considered as additional evidence and not as a gold standard or that some people with dementia have prolonged plateaus so that progressive decline need not be a criterion for Alzheimer's disease (AD), were more controversial and did not receive similar support. Given the evidence of the last three decades, there is merit in reconsidering the criteria by which dementia and AD are diagnosed. (c) 2007 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.

Clinical and molecular phenotype of Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; INFECTION-LIKE SYNDROME; PROGRESSIVE FAMILIAL ENCEPHALOPATHY; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID LYMPHOCYTOSIS; INTERFERON-ALPHA; INTRAUTERINE INFECTION; INTRACRANIAL CALCIFICATION; BASAL GANGLIA; 2 BROTHERS; MUTATIONS	Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) is a genetic encephalopathy whose clinical features mimic those of acquired in utero viral infection. AGS exhibits locus heterogeneity, with mutations identified in genes encoding the 3'-> 5' exonuclease TREX1 and the three subunits of the RNASEH2 endonuclease complex. To define the molecular spectrum of AGS, we performed mutation screening in patients, from 127 pedigrees, with a clinical diagnosis of the disease. Biallelic mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C were observed in 31, 3, 47, and 18 families, respectively. In five families, we identified an RNASEH2A or RNASEH2B mutation on one allele only. In one child, the disease occurred because of a de novo heterozygous TREX1 mutation. In 22 families, no mutations were found. Null mutations were common in TREX1, although a specific missense mutation was observed frequently in patients from northern Europe. Almost all mutations in RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, and RNASEH2C were missense. We identified an RNASEH2C founder mutation in 13 Pakistani families. We also collected clinical data from 123 mutation-positive patients. Two clinical presentations could be delineated: an early-onset neonatal form, highly reminiscent of congenital infection seen particularly with TREX1 mutations, and a later- onset presentation, sometimes occurring after several months of normal development and occasionally associated with remarkably preserved neurological function, most frequently due to RNASEH2B mutations. Mortality was correlated with genotype; 34.3% of patients with TREX1, RNASEH2A, and RNASEH2C mutations versus 8.0% RNASEH2B mutation-positive patients were known to have died (P = .001). Our analysis defines the phenotypic spectrum of AGS and suggests a coherent mutation- screening strategy in this heterogeneous disorder. Additionally, our data indicate that at least one further AGS- causing gene remains to be identified.

AVP-specific RIA, RT-PCR, and immunoblot measurement of AVP receptors (VR) were used to investigate heart tissues from newborn and adult rats. To test AVP's role in differentiation and specialization into ventricle-like cardiomyocytes, we studied GFP-P19C16 stem cells, which express green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter under transcriptional control of the myosin light chain-2v promoter. VR1 transcripts and proteins were higher in adult than in newborn rat hearts. In contrast, VR2 increased from postnatal day 1 to 5 and was barely detected in the adult rat heart. In cardiomyocytes expressing troponin C, immunofluorescence revealed VR2 and VR1. Intracellular cAMP increased 6.5- and 8.9-fold in response to the selective VR2 agonist 1-desamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP) after 1 and 24 h, respectively. Cardiac AVP was high in 1- and 5-day-old (330 +/- 26 and 276 +/- 53 pg/ mg protein, respectively) but low in 66-day-old (98 +/- 15 pg/ mg protein) rats. AVP immuno-staining was detected in the tunica adventitia and endothelium of the coronary vessels. The possible role of AVP in cardiomyogenesis was indicated by DDAVP-AVP-dependent differentiation of GFP-P19C16 stem cells into contracting cells displaying GATA-4, a cardiac-specific marker, and ventricle-specific myosin light chain. Together, it is suggested that the AVP system is implicated in postnatal cardiac maturation.

Salt-sensing mechanisms in blood pressure regulation and hypertension	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						sodium; chloride; osmolality; plasma; tubular fluid; cerebrospinal fluid; salt intake	VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; GLOMERULAR-FILTRATION-RATE; K-CL COTRANSPORTER; MACULA DENSA CELLS; OUABAIN-INDUCED HYPERTENSION; PLASMA SODIUM CONCENTRATION; BOVINE ADRENOCORTICAL-CELLS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NA+-H+ EXCHANGER; DAHL-S RATS	High salt consumption contributes to the development of hypertension and is considered an independent risk factor for vascular remodeling, cardiac hypertrophy, and stroke incidence. In this review, we discuss the molecular origins of primary sensors involved in the phenomenon of salt sensitivity. Based on the analysis of literature data, we conclude that the kidneys and central nervous system (CNS) are two major sites for salt sensing via several distinct mechanisms: 1) [Cl-] sensing in renal tubular fluids, primarily by Na+ -K+ -Cl+ cotransporter (NKCC) isoforms NKCC2B and NKCC2A, whose expression is mainly limited to macula densa cells; 2) [Na+] sensing in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by a novel isoform of Na+ channels, Na-x, expressed in subfornical organs; 3) sensing of CSF osmolality by mechano-sensitive, nonselective cation channels (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 channels), expressed in neuronal cells of supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei; and 4) osmolarity sensing by volume-regulated anion channels in glial cells of supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Such multiplicity of salt-sensing mechanisms likely explains the differential effects of Na+ and Cl- loading on the long-term maintenance of elevated blood pressure that is documented in experimental models of salt-sensitive hypertension.

Pseudo P type DTMOS transistors are used to enhance the differential input common-mode range. The proposed circuits were fabricated using standard CMOS 0.18 mu m CMOS process technology. The fully differential class AB amplifier is implemented to enhance the noise performance of low voltage high precision switched capacitor circuits, the fully balanced preamplifier is implemented to drive the differential inputs of the analog to digital converter used in the analog front-end of a near-infrared spectroreflectometry (NIRS) receiver of a multi-wavelength wireless brain oxymeter apparatus. The power consumption of the proposed preamplifier is only 80 mu W. The minimum experimental supply voltage is roughly 0.8 V.

Ca2+/calmodulin-based signalling in the regulation of the muscle fibre phenotype and its therapeutic potential via modulation of utrophin A and myostatin expression	APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY NUTRITION AND METABOLISM-PHYSIOLOGIE APPLIQUEE NUTRITION ET METABOLISME			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th Annual Conference on Biochemistry of Exercise	OCT 20-23, 2006	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	Korean Natl Sport Univ, Korean Soc Exercise Physiol, Seoul Natl Univ, Aging & Apoptosis Res Ctr		calcineurin; CaMK; gene expression; muscular dystrophy; activity	DUCHENNE MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; DEFICIENT MICE; UP-REGULATION; CALCINEURIN; GROWTH; HYPERTROPHY; GENE; REGENERATION; THERAPIES	Ca2+ signalling plays an important role in excitation-contraction coupling and the resultant force output of skeletal muscle. It is also known to play a crucial role in modulating both short- and long-term muscle cellular phenotypic adaptations associated with these events. Ca2+ signalling via the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CnA) and via Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinases, such as CaMKl and CaMKII, is known to regulate hypertrophic growth in response to overload, to direct slow versus fast fibre gene expression, and to contribute to mitochondrial biogenesis. The CnA- and CaMK-dependent regulation of the downstream transcription factors nuclear factor of activated T cells (NEAT) and myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 are known to activate muscle-specific genes associated with a slower, more oxidative fibre phenotype. We have also recently shown the expression of utrophin A, a cytoskeletal protein that accumulates at the neuromuscular junction and plays a role in maturation of the postsynaptic apparatus, to be regulated by CnA-NFAT and Ca2+/CaM signalling. This regulation is fibre-type specific and potentiated by interactions with the transcriptional regulators and coactivators GA binding protein (also known as nuclear respiratory factor 2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha. Another downstream tat-get of CnA signalling may be myostatin, a transforming growth factor-beta family member that is a negative regulator of muscle growth. While the list of the downstream targets of CnA/NFAT- and Ca2+/CaM-dependent signalling is emerging, the precise interaction of these pathways with the Ca2+-independent pathways p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases l and 2, phosphoinositide-3 kinase, and protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) must also be considered when deciphering fibre responses and plasticity to altered contractile load.

Design: The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects receiving placebo were crossed over into an active arm after treatment unblinding. Setting: The trial was conducted at 4 academic institutions within North America. Patients: Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS who were not taking any other disease-modifying drugs were enrolled in the trial. Further, the patients were required to have either 1 to 5 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on screening brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a relapse in the previous 2 years, or disease worsening in the previous 2 years. Interventions: BHT-3009 was administered as intramuscular injections at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 9 after randomization into the trial, with or without 80 mg of daily oral atorvastatin calcium in combination. Three dose levels of BHT-3009 were tested (0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, and 3 mg). Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability of BHT-3009. Secondary outcome measures included the number and volume of gadolinium-enhanced lesions on MRI, relapses, and analysis of antigen-specific immune responses. Results: BHT-3009 was safe and well tolerated, provided favorable trends on brain MRI, and produced beneficial antigen-specific immune changes. These immune changes consisted of a marked decrease in proliferation of interferon-gamma-producing, myelinreactive CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and a reduction in titers of myelin-specific autoantibodies from cerebral spinal fluid as assessed by protein microarrays. We did not observe a substantial benefit of the atorvastatin combination compared with BHT-3009 alone. Conclusion: In patients with MS, BHT-3009 is safe and induces antigen-specific immune tolerance with concordant reduction of inflammatory lesions on brain MRI.

Design: Longitudinal study of quality of life after stroke. Setting: Hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and universities in Ontario and Quebec. Participants: Subjects (N=316) with confirmed initial stroke were included in this analysis. Fifty-eight percent of the overall sample were men (n=184). The mean age of this sample at the time of the stroke +/- standard deviation was 65.3 +/- 15.3 years (range, 19-96y). One hundred thirty-five patients received a mobility assistive device poststroke, and 181 did not. Intervention: Assistive devices for mobility (canes, walkers, wheelchairs). Main Outcome Measures: Assistive device use and mobility capacity. Results: Mobility device nonusers were less physically disabled than device users on a variety of measures. Poor physical functioning but good cognition were reliably associated with mobility device use. Use of multiple mobility assistive devices was more often associated with poorer physical functioning than was single device use. For single device users, wheelchair use was predicted by cognition, functional independence, and stroke recovery. Cane users, compared with walker users, had better mobility and were less physically impaired by stroke. Conclusions: Patients were well matched to device type based on their mobility capacity. The findings of this study suggest that assistive device prescription-outcome relationships in stroke can be effectively and meaningfully modeled.

However, recent evidence suggests that reward predictability may fail to influence DA signaling over longer scales: In rats passively receiving rewarding electrical brain stimulation, the concentration of DA in dialysate obtained from nucleus accumbens probes was similar regardless of whether reward onset was predictable (G. Hernandez et al., 2006). The present experiment followed up on these findings by requiring the rats to work for the rewarding stimulation, thus confirming whether they indeed learned the timing and predictability of reward delivery. Performance under fixed-interval and variable-interval schedules was compared, and DA levels in the nucleus accumbens were measured by means of in vivo microdialysis. The observed patterns of operant responding indicate that the rats working under the fixed-interval schedule learned to predict the time of reward availability, whereas the rats working under the variable-interval schedule did not. Nonetheless, indistinguishable changes in DA concentration were observed in the 2 groups. Thus, reward predictability had no discernable effect on a measure believed to track the slower components of DA signaling.

Although several candidate biomarkers of sporadic AD have been identified and commercialized, none currently fulfill the criteria for an ideal test. In this article, we review evidence implicating blood heme oxygenase-1 mRNA/protein levels and a recently identified plasma heme oxygenase-1 suppressor factor as potential biomarkers of AD and mild cognitive impairment.

EF is comprised of several processes including inhibition, working memory and set shifting that develop throughout the lifespan. Impairments in E F may appear early in development and persist, or may represent a more transient delay which resolves with time. Given the unevenness of the cognitive profile of persons with autism, understanding the development of EF poses methodological challenges. These issues include those related to matching measures and the choice of comparison participants to which the performance of persons with autism will be compared. In the current review, we attempt to break down the processes of inhibition, working memory and set shifting among persons with autism. We propose to do this within a developmental perspective that highlights how matching measures and comparison participants can affect the interpretation of research findings. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Aims To determine whether glutamatergic changes in patients with schizophrenia correlated with grey-matter losses during the first years of illness. Method Left anterior cingulate and thalamic glutamatergic metabolite levels and grey-matter volumes were examine in 16 patients with first-episocle schizophrenia before and after 10 months and 30 months of antipsychotic treatment and in 16 healthy participants on two occasions 30 months apart. Results Higher than normal glutamine levels were found in the anterior cingulate and thalamus of never-treated patients, Thalamic levels of glutamine were significantly reduced after 30 months. Limited grey-matter reductions were seen in patients at 10 months followed by widespread grey-matter loss at 30 months. Parietal and temporal lobe grey-matter loss was correlated with thalamic glutamine loss.

Clinical features: A 64-yr-old male with NPS, renal impairment and coronary artery disease presented for right hemicolectomy for colon cancer. Following initiation of surgery and during insertion of a nasogastric tube there was sudden loss of the patient's pulse oxymetry, and arterial pressure waveforms with an asystolic electrocardiogram signal. Atropine 0.6 mg iv was administered and after an asystolic period of 20-30 sec, myocardial activity commenced at 110 beats min(-1) with return of normal vital signs and no further sequelae. Conclusions: Nail-Patella syndrome can present with an array of anomalies that may be associated with perioperative complications. Glaucoma, nephropathy, vasomotor dysfunction, fragile teeth, abnormal muscle, skeletal and nerve anatomy as well as involvement of the central and/or peripheral nervous systems are common findings. In this setting it is postulated that a vasovagal reflex from esophageal stimulation by nasogastric tube placement may have caused the asystolic event. This response could have been exaggerated by the sympatholytic combination of neuraxial block, preoperative beta-blockade, and potential autonomic dysfunction secondary to NPS. Awareness of this uncommon disease and its presentation may serve to caution the anesthesiologist regarding the perioperative implications of patients with this syndrome.

We describe the case of a 17-month-old boy who sustained a possible air embolism during repair of an open trauma of his right eye. Clinical features: A vitrectomy through the pars plana with air-fluid exchange of the posterior chamber was performed under general anesthesia to remove a foreign body which had impaled the optic nerve. A few minutes after removal of the foreign body, a notable decrease in end-tidal CO2, oxygen saturation and arterial blood pressure occurred, requiring administration of a high inspired oxygen fraction and vasopressors. Venous air embolism was strongly suspected after other causes of a decrease of end-tidal CO2 and hypoxemia had been excluded. An arterial blood gas confirmed hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. Conclusion: Although venous air embolism is a rare complication of eye surgery, it should nevertheless be considered as a possible complication during air-fluid exchange vitrectomy in children.

Method: We searched MEDLINE for published English-language medical literature, using Alzheimer disease and treatment as key words. No other search engine was used. Our review focused on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and corresponding metaanalyses. Results: Although there are many RCTs for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), none have been successful in their primary analysis. The cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine have demonstrated efficacy in 3- to 12-month placebo-controlled RCTs assessing cognitive, functional, behavioural, and global outcomes in patients with mildly to moderately severe AD. Recent data from patients with severe stages of AD demonstrate the efficacy of donepezil on cognitive and functional measures but not on behaviour. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine has been demonstrated to be effective in 6-month, placebo-controlled RCTs of 6 months duration assessing cognitive, functional, and global outcomes of inpatients with moderate-to-severe AD (defined as a Mini Mental State Examination score below 20). Post hoc analyses have demonstrated a benefit in regard to agitation and (or) aggression, but this needs to be confirmed in a prospective RCT across Canada. Disease-modifying treatments are being tested in mild stages of AD in 18-month RCTs with cognitive and global outcomes as primary efficacy outcomes, primarily with drugs reducing amyloid synthesis or aggregation. Successful treatment in mild stages of AD could lead to RCTs in MCI and, possibly, in genetically high-risk asymptomatic individuals. Conclusion: The significant advances in the symptomatic pharmacotherapy of AD may be followed by disease-modification treatments.

Effective chemotherapy is lacking for most types of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children. Temozolomide, an agent with activity against adult brain tumors, was investigated in children and adolescents with recurrent CNS tumors. METHODS. Temozolomide was administered orally as monthly 5-day courses at doses of 200 mg/m(2)/d (patients with no prior craniospinal irradiation [CSI]) or 180 mg/m(2)/d (prior CSI). Patients with a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response or stable disease (SD) could continue temozolomide for up to 12 cycles. RESULTS. The cohort comprised 122 patients, including 113 with CNS tumors. Median age was 11 years (range, 1-23 years). Among 104 evaluable patients with CNS tumors, 5 PRs and 1 CR were observed. PRs occurred in 1 of 23 evaluable patients with high-grade astrocytoma, 1 of 21 with low-grade astrocytoma, and 3 of 25 with medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). The CR occurred in an additional patient with medulloblastoma/PNET. No responses were observed in patients with ependymoma, brain-stem glioma, or other CNS tumors. Notably, 41% of patients with low-grade astrocytoma had SD through 12 courses. The most frequent toxicities were grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (19%) and thrombocytopenia (25%); nonhematologic toxicity was infrequent. CONCLUSIONS. Although overall objective responses were limited, further exploration of temozolomide may be warranted in children with medulloblastoma and other PNETs, or in patients with low-grade astrocytoma, perhaps in a setting of less pretreatment than the patients in the current study, or in the context of multiagent therapy.

However, little is known about the network of anatomical connections in the human brain. Here, we investigated large-scale anatomical connection patterns of the human cerebral cortex using cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance images. Two areas were considered anatomically connected if they showed statistically significant correlations in cortical thickness and we constructed the network of such connections using 124 brains from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping database. Significant short- and long-range connections were found in both intra- and interhemispheric regions, many of which were consistent with known neuroanatomical pathways measured by human diffusion imaging. More importantly, we showed that the human brain anatomical network had robust small-world properties with cohesive neighborhoods and short mean distances between regions that were insensitive to the selection of correlation thresholds. Additionally, we also found that this network and the probability of finding a connection between 2 regions for a given anatomical distance had both exponentially truncated power-law distributions. Our results demonstrated the basic organizational principles for the anatomical network in the human brain compatible with previous functional networks studies, which provides important implications of how functional brain states originate from their structural underpinnings. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of small-world properties and degree distribution of anatomical networks in the human brain using cortical thickness measurements.

In this study, 168 boys were administered a card-playing task at ages 13 and 14 years to assess response perseveration. This task was designed to initially reward playing and gradually associate playing with punishment. Measures of subjective ordering (cool processes) and neuroticism (hot processes) at age 13 years were used to examine how these individual characteristics relate to perseveration over time. A decrease in perseveration from age 13 to 14 was associated with cool processes whereas hot processes were associated with response perseveration only over time. A complementary but simultaneous assessment of cool and hot processes, such as neuropsychological and personality tests, could facilitate treatment planning of children with behavioral problems.

CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						estrogen; cognition; aging; postmenopausal women	CONJUGATED EQUINE ESTROGENS; HEALTH INITIATIVE MEMORY; HORMONE-THERAPY; WORKING-MEMORY; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; DISEASE; ESTRADIOL; BRAIN; RISK	Although there is evidence from randomized controlled trials that estrogen therapy protects against aspects of cognitive decline that occur with normal aging in women, findings from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study and from some cross-sectional and longitudinal studies failed to find neuroprotective effects of estrogen in older women. There is growing empirical support for the critical-period hypothesis, formulated in the attempt to resolve these discrepancies. It holds that estrogen therapy has protective effects on verbal memory and on working memory only when it is initiated closely in time to menopause, whereas starting treatment many years following menopause does not protect and may even be harmful. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis from basic neuroscience and from animal and human studies is evaluated for its ability to explain the inconsistencies and to describe the conditions under which estrogen may protect cognitive function in aging women.

J	Beaulieu, P; Ware, M				Beaulieu, Pierre; Ware, Mark			Reassessment of the role of cannabinoids in the management of pain	CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						cannabinoids; neuropathic pain; postoperative pain; tetrahydrocannabinol		Purpose of review The aim of this article is to assess the role of cannabinoids in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans. Recent findings Very few clinical trials looking at the analgesic effects of cannabinoids in the acute pain settings have been performed. Three recent studies have evaluated the oral administration of synthetic cannabinoids in postoperative pain. At low doses cannabinoids are not different from placebo, whereas at high doses they may be associated with adverse effects or even worsening of pain intensity. In chronic pain patients, the safety and analgesic efficacy of a number of cannabinoid compounds have recently been evaluated in several clinical trials in several chronic pain conditions. While the small size of the trials and the relatively short duration of follow-up limits broad generalization, to date there is increasing evidence that cannabinoids are safe and effective for refractory chronic pain conditions including neuropathic pain associated with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and peripheral neuropathy associated with HIV/AIDS. Summary The precise role of cannabinoids in pain treatment still needs further evaluation. Cannabinoid compounds may be more effective in the context of chronic neuropathic pain than for the management of acute pain.

Hand1 is expressed in the distal (ventral) zone of the branchial arches, whereas the Hand2 expression domain extends ventrolaterally to occupy two-thirds of the mandibular arch. To circumvent the early embryonic lethality of Hand1 or Hand2-null embryos and to examine their roles in neural crest development, we generated mice with neural crest-specific deletion of Hand1 and various combinations of mutant alleles of Hand2. Ablation of Hand1 alone in neural crest cells did not affect embryonic development, however, further removing one Hand2 allele or deleting the ventrolateral branchial arch expression of Hand2 led to a novel phenotype presumably due to impaired growth of the distal midline mesenchyme. Although we failed to detect changes in proliferation or apoptosis between the distal mandibular arch of wild-type and Hand1/Hand2 compound mutants at embryonic day (E)10.5, dysregulation of Pax9, Msx2 and Prx2 was observed in the distal mesenchyme at E12.5. In addition, the inter-dental mesenchyme and distal symphysis of Meckel's cartilage became hypoplastic, resulting in the formation of a single fused lower incisor within the hypoplastic fused mandible. These findings demonstrate the importance of Hand transcription factors in the transcriptional circuitry of craniofacial and tooth development. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the expression of E3(Histone)/LASU1 remains poorly studied. Because we identified E3(Histone)/LASU1 from the testis, we explored its regulation during spermatogenesis. In the first wave of rat spermatogenesis, E3(Histone)/LASU1 mRNA and protein had peak expression at days 10 and 20, respectively, and decreased with age. Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemistry revealed that E3(Histone)/LASU1 was highly expressed in nuclei from spermatogonia to mid-pachytene spermatocytes. There was no obvious staining in spermatids, when histones are ubiquitinated and degraded. E3(Histone)/LASU1 was also expressed in other tissues. However, except in neuronal cells of the brain, expression was cytoplasmic. Thus, E3(Histone)/LASU1 may play a role in chromatin modification in early germ cells of the testis, but also has functions in other tissues.

It catalyzes the methylation of arginine residues to monomethylarginines and asymmetrical dimethylarginines. The DART4 sequence is highly similar to mammalian PRMT4/CARM1, and DART4 substrate specificity has been conserved, too. Recently it was suggested that DART4/Carmer functions in ecdysone receptor mediated apoptosis of the polytene larval salivary glands and an apparent up-regulation of DART4/Carmer mRNA levels before tissue histolysis was reported. Here we show that in Drosophila larvae, DART4 is mainly expressed in the imaginal disks and in larval brains, and to a much lesser degree in the polytene larval tissue such as salivary glands. In glands, DART4 protein is present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The nuclear signal emanates from the extrachromosomal domain and gets progressively restricted to the region of the nuclear lamina upon pupariation. Surprisingly, DART4 levels do not increase in salivary glands during pupariation, and overexpression of DART4 does not cause precautious cell death in the glands. Furthermore, over- and misexpression of DART4 under the control of the alpha tubulin promoter do not lead to any major problem in the life of a fly. This suggests that DART4 activity is regulated at the posttranslational level and/or that it acts as a true cofactor in vivo. We present evidence that nuclear localization of DART4 may contribute to its function because DART4 accumulation changes from a distribution with a strong cytoplasmic component during the transcriptional quiescence of the young embryo to a predominantly nuclear one at the onset of zygotic transcription.

Raclopride-induced motor consolidation impairment in primates: role of the dopamine type-2 receptor in movement chunking into integrated sequences	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						dopamine; motor learning; striatum; primate; raclopride	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; VISUOMOTOR SEQUENCE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; SERIAL ORDER; HALOPERIDOL; SCHIZOPHRENIA; STRIATUM	Results obtained in patients with schizophrenia have shown that antipsychotic drugs may induce motor learning deficits correlated with the striatal type-2 dopamine receptors (D2R) occupancy. Other findings suggest that the role of the striatum in motor learning could be related to a process of "chunking" discrete movements into motor sequences. We therefore hypothesized that a D2R blocking substance, such as raclopride, would affect motor learning by specifically disrupting the grouping of movements into sequences. Two monkeys were first trained to perform a baseline-overlearned sequence (Seq. A) drug free. Then, a new sequence was learned (Seq. B) and the overlearned sequence was recalled OFF-drug (Seq. A recall OFF-drug). The effect of raclopride was then assessed on the learning of a third sequence (Seq. C), and on the recall of the overlearned sequence (Seq. A recall ON-drug). Results showed that performance related to the overlearned sequence remained the same in the three experimental conditions (Seq. A, Seq. A recall OFF-drug, Seq. A recall ON-drug), whether the primates received raclopride or not. On the other hand, new sequence learning was significantly affected during raclopride treatment (Seq. C), when compared with new sequence learning without the effect of any drug (Seq. B). Raclopride-induced disturbances consisted in performance fluctuations, which persisted even after many days of trials, and prevented the monkeys from reaching a stable level of performance. Further analyses also showed that these fluctuations appeared to be related to monkeys' inability to group movements into single flowing motor sequences. The results of our study suggest that dopamine is involved in the stabilization or consolidation of motor performances, and that this function would involve a chunking of movements into well-integrated sequences.

With respect to the CPG, recent analysis of fictive locomotion has shown that durations of flexion and extension tend to covary along specific lines in plots of phase duration versus cycle duration. The slopes of these lines evidently depend on internal states that vary among preparations, but, within a preparation, remain rather steady from one sequence to the next. These relationships can be reproduced in a simple oscillator model having two pairs of preset parameters, suggesting that steady internal drives to flexor and extensor half-centers determine how phase durations covary. Regarding the role of sensory inputs, previous experiments have revealed state-dependent rules that govern phase-switching independently of the CPG rhythm. In addition, sensory input is known to modulate motoneuronal activation through stretch reflexes. To explore how sensory input combines with the locomotor CPG, we used a neuromechanical model with muscle actuators, proprioceptive feedback, sensory phase-switching rules, and a CPG. Interestingly, sequences of stable locomotion were always associated with phase durations that conformed to an extensor-dominated phase-duration characteristic (where extension durations vary more than flexion durations). This is the characteristic seen in normal animals, but not necessarily in fictive locomotion, where movement and associated sensory input are absent. This suggests that to produce the biomechanical events required for stability, an extensor-dominated phase-duration characteristic is required. In the model, when the preset CPG phase durations were well matched to coincide the biomechanical requirements, CPG-mediated phase switching produced stable cycles. When CPG phase durations were too short, phases switched prematurely and the model soon fell. When CPG phase durations were too long, sensory rules fired and overrode the CPG, maintaining stability. We posit that under normal circumstances, descending input from higher centers continually adjusts the operating point of the CPG on the preset phase-duration characteristic according to anticipated biomechanical requirements. When the predictions are good, CPG-generated phase durations closely match those required by the kinetics and kinematics, and little or no sensory adjustment occurs. We propose the term "neuromechanical tuning" to describe this process of matching the CPG to the biomechanical requirements.

Muscular responses during motor imagery as a function of muscle contraction types	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						motor imagery; EMG; muscle contraction	MENTAL PRACTICE; SIMULATED MOVEMENT; EXTERNAL IMAGERY; EXECUTED ACTIONS; EMG ACTIVITY; SKILL LEVEL; EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; STRENGTH	This study was designed to gain more insight into the mechanisms underlying motor imagery (MI). While there is ample evidence that motor performance and MI share common central neural mechanisms, the question whether MI is accompanied by subliminal electromyographic (EMG) activity remained unsolved. Thirty right-handed volunteers were asked to lift or to imagine lifting a weighted dumbbell using different types of muscle contraction, i.e. heavy concentric, light concentric, isometric and eccentric contractions. EMG activity from 9 muscles of the dominant arm (agonist, antagonist, synergist and fixator muscles) was monitored. Autonomic nervous system responses were also recorded on the non-dominant hand, thus attesting mental activity at the peripheral level. A significant increased pattern of EMG activity was recorded in all muscles during MI, when compared to the rest condition, while the goniometric data did not reveal any movement. Although being subliminal, the magnitude of this activation was found to be correlated to the mental effort required to lift a weight mentally, as more EMG activity was recorded during imaginary lifting of heavy than light concentric contractions. When considering the different types of contraction, our results provided evidence of selective changes in EMG activity. Especially, the imagined eccentric condition elicited a significant weaker muscular activity than all other conditions. In addition. the changes in the EMG pattern mirrored those usually observed during physical movement. These findings support the hypotheses of a selective effect of MI at the level of muscular activity and of incomplete inhibition of the motor command during MI. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this controller is to regulate automatically the level of the power to be transferred and to modulate the carrier signals during data transmission. It includes several new integrated building blocks such as integrated pulse-width modulator (PWM), RF envelope detector, frequency-locked loop (FLL), and amplitude-shift keying (ASK) modulator and demodulator. CMOS 0.18 mu m technology is used to implement this controller that operates at 1.8V power supply and a frequency of 20 MHz. Preliminary postlayout simulation results prove that all the main blocks of the controller (the FLL, the PWM, and the ASKD) operate adequately. From simulation results, the time response of the system is estimated at 0.8 mu s. The complete controller has been recently submitted for fabrication.

Here we demonstrated that all retinal MCs express CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and that homozygosity for the CX3CR1 M280 allele, which is associated with impaired cell migration, increases the risk of AMD. In humans with AMD, MCs accumulated in the subretinal space at sites of retinal degeneration and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In CX3CR1-deficient mice, MCs accumulated subretinally with age and albino background and after laser impact preceding retinal degeneration. Raising the albino mice in the dark prevented both events. The appearance of lipid-bloated subretinal MCs was drusen-like on funduscopy of senescent mice, and CX3CR1-dependent MC accumulation was associated with an exacerbation of experimental CNV These results show that CX3CR1-dependent accumulation of subretinal MCs evokes cardinal features of AMD. These findings reveal what we believe to be a novel pathogenic process with important implications for the development of new therapies for AMD.

Synergistic airway gland mucus secretion in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide and carbachol is lost in cystic fibrosis	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article							INDUCED LIQUID SECRETION; TRACHEAL SUBMUCOSAL GLANDS; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; CL-SECRETION; CHLORIDE SECRETION; FLUID SECRETION; SWEAT SECRETION; FERRET TRACHEA; SURFACE FLUID; SMOOTH-MUSCLE	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an anion channel whose dysfunction leads to chronic bacterial and fungal airway infections via a pathophysiological cascade that is incompletely understood. Airway glands, which produce most airway mucus, do so in response to both acetylcholine (ACh) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). CF glands fail to secrete mucus in response to VIP, but do so in response to ACh. Because vagal cholinergic pathways still elicit strong gland mucus secretion in CF subjects, it is unclear whether VIP-stimulated, CFTR-dependent gland secretion participates in innate defense. It was recently hypothesized that airway intrinsic neurons, which express abundant VIP and ACh, are normally active and stimulate low-level gland mucus secretion that is a component of innate mucosal defenses. Here we show that low levels of VIP and ACh produced significant mucus secretion in human glands via strong synergistic interactions; synergy was lost in glands of CF patients. VIP/ACh synergy also existed in pig glands, where it was CFTR dependent, mediated by both Cl(-) and HCO(3)(-), and clotrimazole sensitive. Loss of "housekeeping" gland mucus secretion in CF, in combination with demonstrated defects in surface epithelia, may play a role in the vulnerability of CF airways to bacterial infections.

Platelet activating factor-induced neuronal apoptosis is initiated independently of its G-protein coupled PAF receptor and is inhibited by the benzoate orsellinic acid	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						apoptosis; benzoic acids; neurotoxicity; orsellinic acid; platelet activating factor; platelet activating factor receptor	GINKGO-BILOBA; DOUBLE-BLIND; RAT-BRAIN; EXPRESSION; DEMENTIA; MICE; INVOLVEMENT; MEMORY; TRIAL; INTRAHIPPOCAMPAL	The bioactive lipid mediator platelet activating factor (PAF) is recognized as a key effecter of neuronal apoptosis, yet it is not clear whether its G-protein coupled receptor (PAFR) initiates or prevents PAF neurotoxicity. Using PAFR-/- and congenic wild-type mice, we show that PAF triggers caspase-3/7 activity and neuronal death in PAFR-/- but not PAFR+/+ cerebellar granule neurons. Restoring receptor expression by recombinant adenoviral infection protected cells from PAF challenge. Neuronal death was not mediated by nitric oxide or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor signaling given that N-nitroL-arginine methyl ester and MK-801 did not inhibit PAF-induced neuronal loss in PAFR-/- neurons. To intervene in PAFR-independent neurotoxicity, the anti-apoptotic actions of three structurally distinct PAF antagonists were compared to a panel of plant and fungal benzoic acid derivatives. We found that the PAF antagonist BN 52021 but not FR 49175 or CV 3988 inhibited PAFR-independent neurotoxicity. Orsellinic acid, a fungal-derived benzoic acid, blocked PAF-mediated neuronal apoptosis without affecting PAFR-mediated neuroprotection. These findings demonstrate that PAF can transcluce apoptotic death in primary neurons independently of its G-protein coupled receptor, that PAFR activation is neuroprotective, and that orsellinic acid effectively attenuates PAFR-independent neuronal apoptosis.

High intracellular concentrations of amyloid-beta block nuclear translocation of phosphorylated CREB	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; amyloid-beta; brain-derived neurotrophic factor; cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein; presenilins	INTRANEURONAL A-BETA-42 ACCUMULATION; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PRECURSOR PROTEIN; A-BETA; TRANSGENIC RATS; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; MESSENGER-RNA; SYNAPSIN-I; HIPPOCAMPAL	The beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) is considered responsible for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Despite the magnitude of reports describing a neurotoxic role of extracellular AP, the role for intracellular A beta (iA beta) has not been elucidated. We previously demonstrated that in rat pheochromocytoma cells expression of moderate levels of AP results in the up-regulation of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1)/2 along with an elevation of cyclic AMP-response element (CRE)-regulated gene expression; however, the effect of high intracellular levels of AP were not examined. Towards this goal we generated constructs that endogenously produce different expression levels of iA beta in a human cell line. We show a bimodal response to iA beta in a neural human cell line. A moderate increase of endogenous A beta up-regulates certain cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) responsive genes such as presenilin 1, presenilin 2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and mRNA and protein levels by CREB activation and Synapsin 1 nuclear translocation. On the other hand, high-loads of A beta resulted in sustained hyper-phosphorylation of CREB that did not translocate to the nucleus and did not stimulate activation of CRE-regulated gene expression. Our study suggests that variations in levels of iA beta could influence signaling mechanisms that lead to phosphorylation of CREB, its nuclear translocation and CRE-regulated genes involved in production of A beta and synaptic plasticity in opposite directions.

Zn2+ slows down Ca(V)3.3 gating kinetics: Implications for thalamocortical activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							THALAMIC RETICULAR NEURONS; CHILDHOOD ABSENCE EPILEPSY; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; RELAY NEURONS; SENSORY NEURONS; CA2+ CHANNELS; SYNAPTIC RELEASE; VISUAL-CORTEX; GENE FAMILY; IN-VIVO	We employed whole cell patch-clamp recordings to establish the effect of Zn2+ on the gating the brain specific, T-type channel isoform Ca(V)3.3 expressed in HEK-293 cells. Zn2+ (300 mu M) modified the gating kinetics of this channel without influencing its steady-state properties. When inward Ca2+ currents were elicited by step depolarizations at voltages above the threshold for channel opening, current inactivation was significantly slowed down while current activation was moderately affected. In addition, Zn2+ slowed down channel deactivation but channel recovery from inactivation was only modestly changed. Zn2+ also decreased whole cell Ca2+ permeability to 45% of control values. In the presence of Zn2+, Ca2+ currents evoked by mock action potentials were more persistent than in its absence. Furthermore, computer simulation of action potential generation in thalamic reticular cells performed to model the gating effect of Zn2+ on T-type channels ( while leaving the kinetic parameters of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ unchanged) revealed that Zn2+ increased the frequency and the duration of burst firing, which is known to depend on T-type channel activity. In line with this finding, we discovered that chelation of endogenous Zn2+ decreased the frequency of occurrence of ictal-like epileptiform discharges in rat thalamocortical slices perfused with medium containing the convulsant 4-aminopyridine (50 mu M). These data demonstrate that Zn2+ modulates Ca(V)3.3 channel gating thus leading to increased neuronal excitability. We also propose that endogenous Zn2+ may have a role in controlling thalamocortical oscillations.

Materials and Methods: A total of 40 patients were exclusively treated conservatively with or without anticholinergics and/or clean intermittent catheterization through puberty at our institution. The records of 37 patients (17 males and 20 females) were available for review and constituted the subject matter for our study. The neurological lesion was sacral in 4 patients, lumbosacral in 5, thoracic in 12 and lumbar in 16. Clinical evaluations, radiological imaging studies of the upper urinary tract and urodynamic studies were repeated every 6 to 12 months. Data were collected and comparisons were made with respect to prepubertal (age 10 years) and postpubertal (15) continence status, urodynamic parameters and upper urinary tract changes. Children spontaneously achieving urinary continence postpubertally were examined in a similar fashion as a separate subgroup. Continence was defined as a dry interval of 4 hours or more. Results: Of the 26 patients with urinary incontinence before puberty 12 (2 males and 10 females, 45%, p < 0.003) achieved continence following puberty. Hydronephrosis remained stable in 4 patients, improved in 3 and was new onset in 3 (p > 0.05). Vesicoureteral reflux persisted in 1 patient, resolved in 4 and was new onset in 1 (p > 0.05). Total cystometric bladder capacity, maximum detrusor pressure and detrusor leak point pressure all increased significantly after puberty, from 277 +/- 82 to 487 140 ml, 45 +/- 17 to 54 +/- 20 cm H,O and 49 +/- 16 to 59 +/- 21 cm H2O, respectively. In patients achieving urinary continence following puberty total cystometric bladder capacity increased significantly from 284 58 to 473 +/- 93 ml (p < 0.005). Maximum detrusor pressure and detrusor leak point pressure showed insignificant changes after puberty, increasing from 45 11 to 47 +/- 16 cm H2O and from 46 +/- 11 to 55 21 cm H2O, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that total cystometric bladder capacity, maximum detrusor pressure and detrusor leak point pressure increase significantly in patients with myelomeningocele following puberty. The increase in bladder capacity could be attributed to increasing bladder outlet resistance resulting from prostate gland enlargement in males and estrogenization in females. A significant number of patients spontaneously achieve continence at puberty, and continence becomes more likely when increased total cystometric bladder capacity is not associated with an increase in maximum detrusor pressure. Finally, no significant postpubertal upper urinary tract deterioration was observed in our series.

MRI is an invaluable diagnostic tool but it lacks the specificity to distinguish ADEM from the first attack of MS. Advanced MRI techniques might have the required specificity to reveal whether the loss of integrity in non-lesional tissue occurs as a fundamental feature of MS. Although the onset of MS in childhood typically predicts a favourable short-term prognosis, some children are severely disabled, either physically or cognitively, and more than 50% are predicted to enter the secondary-progressive phase of the disease by the age of 30 years. Immunomodulatory therapies for MS and their safe application in children can improve long-term prognosis. Genetic and environmental factors, such as viral infection, might be uniquely amenable to study in paediatric patients with MS. Understanding the immunological consequences of these putative exposures will shed light on the early pathological changes in MS.

Structural equation modeling (SEM) has been the main approach to examine effective connectivity. In this paper, we propose a method that, given a set of regions, performs partial correlation analysis. This method provides an approach to effective connectivity that is data driven, in the sense that it does not require any prior information regarding the anatomical or functional connections. To demonstrate the practical relevance of partial correlation analysis for effective connectivity investigation, we reanalyzed data previously published [Bullmore, Horwitz, Honey, Brammer, Williams, Sharma, 2000. How good is good enough in path analysis of fMRI data? NeuroImage 11, 289-301]. Specifically, we show that partial correlation analysis can serve several purposes. In a pre-processing step, it can hint at which effective connections are structuring the interactions and which have little influence on the pattern of connectivity. As a post-processing step, it can be used both as a simple and visual way to check the validity of SEM optimization algorithms and to show which assumptions made by the model are valid, and which ones should be further modified to better fit the data.

FosB-knockout mice are reported to be defective in parental care. To clarify molecular signaling responsible for parental behavior, we investigated gene expression profiles in the MPOAd of parental versus nonparental mice. We identified upregulation of NGFI-B, SPRY1, and Rad in parental mice, together with c-Fos and FosB. A common inducer of these genes, the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) was phosphorylated in MPOAd neurons upon pup exposure. Pharmacological blockade of ERK phosphorylation inhibited the FosB upregulation in MPOAd, and the initiation of pup retrieving in virgin female mice, but did not affect the established parenting in parous females. Furthermore, induction of SPRY1 and Rad was impaired in MPOAd of nonparental FosB-knockout mice. These results suggest the pivotal role of ERK-FosB signaling in the initiation of parental care.

However, dystrophin, as a neoantigen, elicits antibody formation. As an alternative approach, we evaluated gene transfer of full-length murine utrophin, a functional homologue of dystrophin that is normally present only at the neuromuscular junction. A single injection in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of the helper-dependent adenovirus vector encoding utrophin provided very good transduction, with 58% of fibers demonstrating sarcolemmal utrophin expression in the neonates, and 35% utrophin-positive (Utr(+)) fibers in adults. The presence of utrophin prevented extensive necrosis in the neonates, halted further necrosis in the adults, and led to restoration of sarcolemmal expression of dystrophin-associated proteins up to 1 year after injection. Marked physiological improvement was observed in both neonates and adults. Neither increased humoral responses nor cellular immune responses were evident. However, there was a time-related decline of the initial high utrophin expression. Although viral DNA persisted in animals that were injected in the neonatal stage, viral DNA levels decreased in muscles of adult mice. These results demonstrate that although utrophin gene transfer leads to amelioration of the dystrophic phenotype, the effects are not sustained upon loss of utrophin expression.

We demonstrate here the expression of IL- 17 and IL- 22 receptors on blood- brain barrier endothelial cells (BBB-ECs) in multiple sclerosis lesions, and show that IL- 17 and IL- 22 disrupt BBB tight junctions in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, T(H)17 lymphocytes transmigrate efficiently across BBB-ECs, highly express granzyme B, kill human neurons and promote central nervous system inflammation through CD4(+) lymphocyte recruitment.

J	Bastianetto, S; Brouillette, J; Quirion, R				Bastianetto, Stephane; Brouillette, Jonathan; Quirion, Remi			Neuroprotective effects of natural products: Interaction with intracellular kinases, amyloid peptides and a possible role for transthyretin	NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; AB peptides; resveratrol; tea catechins; transthyretin; polyphenols; neuroprotection; beta-amyloid; PKC	TEA POLYPHENOL (-)-EPIGALLOCATECHIN-3-GALLATE; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; A-BETA TOXICITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; PRECURSOR PROTEIN; CHOROID-PLEXUS; TRANSGENIC MICE; RODENT MODEL; IN-VITRO	Various studies reported on the neuroprotective effects of natural products, particularly polyphenols, widely present in food and beverages. For example, we have shown that resveratrol, a polyphenol contained present in red wine and other foods, activates the phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC), this effect being involved in its neuroprotective action against AB-induced toxicity. Moreover, tea-derived catechin gallate esters inhibit the formation AB oligomers/fibrils, suggesting that this action likely contributes to their neuroprotective effects. Interestingly, the effects of polyphenols may be attributable, at least in part, to the presence of specific binding sites. Autoradiographic studies revealed that these binding sites are particularly enriched in choroids plexus in the rat brain. Interestingly, the choroid plexus secretes transthyretin, a protein that has been shown to prevent A beta aggregation and that may be critical to the maintenance of normal learning capacities in aging. Taken together, these data suggest that polyphenols target multiple enzymes/proteins leading to their neuroprotective actions.
