Detection and monitoring can be limited by contextual level of consciousness (LOC) alterations, cognition, expression, or language deficits. Recent data suggest that existing pain assessment tools may not be applicable to all neurocritically ill patients, especially in those with LOC alterations and atypical pain-associated behaviors. Targeted sedation goals may be neurologically disease specific; for instance, intracranial pressure (ICP) targets will supersede sedation titration by other criteria. Technology such as bispectral index (BIS) may be beneficial in avoiding excessive medication administration in deeply sedated neurologically injured ICU patients. Given the wide variety of pathology in the neurocritically ill patients, it is unclear if delirium can be diagnosed and unequivocally differentiated from symptoms of the underlying neurological pathology. However, delirium symptoms may herald life-threatening primary insult progression or result from a new secondary neurological injury and should be monitored. Patients with neurological injury or illness are often excluded from ICU studies addressing pain, sedation, and delirium, but this need not be the case. We review what is understood in this area based on current evidence.

However, direct evidence is limited, and no prospective studies have measured when autonomic dysfunction starts before disease. Patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder are at very high risk of developing neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, providing an opportunity to directly observe the development of autonomic dysfunction from prodromal stages of neurodegeneration. Patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder were followed annually in a prospective cohort that was established in 2004. Urinary, orthostatic, erectile, and constipation symptoms and systolic blood pressure drop from lying to standing were assessed annually. Patients who eventually developed defined synucleinopathy were compared with age-matched controls. The evolution of autonomic measures was assessed with regression analysis to determine when markers first deviated from control values. Sensitivity and specificity of autonomic markers for identification of prodromal disease were calculated. Of 91 patients, 32 developed disease. In prodromal stages, there was substantial autonomic dysfunction observable at least 5 years before diagnosis. On regression analysis, autonomic dysfunction appeared to progress slowly over prodromal periods. The estimated onset of autonomic dysfunction ranged from 11 years to 20 years, and systolic drop (20.4 years) and constipation (15.3 years) had the earliest estimates. Systolic drop, erectile dysfunction, and constipation could identify disease up to 5 years before diagnosis with sensitivity ranging from 50% to 90%. By directly observing development of neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, we confirmed that autonomic dysfunction can occur early in neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, even as long as 20 years before defined disease.

OBJECTIVE: To identify early risk factors for delirium in patients admitted to the intensive care unit following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). METHODS: An observational study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit from January 2000 to May 2010 for elective or semi-elective OLT was conducted. The primary end point was delirium in the intensive care unit. Pre- and post-transplantation and intraoperative factors potentially associated with this outcome were examined. RESULTS: Of the 281 patients included in the study, 28 (10.03%) developed delirium in the intensive care unit at a median of two days (interquartile range one to seven days) after OLT. According to multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for delirium were intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells (OR 1.15 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.18]), renal replacement therapy during the pretransplantation period (OR 13.12 [95% CI 2.82 to 72.12]) and Acute Physiologic and Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (OR per unit increase 1.10 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.29]). Using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline covariates, delirium was associated with an almost twofold risk of remaining in hospital, a fourfold increased risk of dying in hospital and an almost threefold increased rate of death by one year. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells, pretransplantation renal replacement therapy and APACHE II score are predictors for the development of delirium in intensive care unit patients post-OLT and are associated with increased hospital lengths of stay and mortality.

Wireless Recording Systems: From Noninvasive EEG-NIRS to Invasive EEG Devices	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bluetooth and dual radio links; brain imaging; electroencephalography (EEG); embedded systems; intracerebral EEG; near-infrared spectrometry; refractory epilepsy; wearable bioelectronics; wireless data recording	POWER INTEGRATED-CIRCUIT; TRANSMISSION-SYSTEM; PARTIAL EPILEPSY; INTERFACE	In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a wireless wearable electronic system dedicated to remote data recording for brain monitoring. The reported wireless recording system is used for a) simultaneous near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) and scalp electro-encephalography (EEG) for noninvasive monitoring and b) intracerebral EEG (icEEG) for invasive monitoring. Bluetooth and dual radio links were introduced for these recordings. The Bluetooth-based device was embedded in a noninvasive multichannel EEG-NIRS system for easy portability and long-term monitoring. On the other hand, the 32-channel implantable recording device offers 24-bit resolution, tunable features, and a sampling frequency up to 2 kHz per channel. The analog front-end preamplifier presents low input-referred noise of 5 mu V-RMS and a signal-to-noise ratio of 112 dB. The communication link is implemented using a dual-band radio frequency transceiver offering a half-duplex 800 kb/s data rate, 16.5 mW power consumption and less than 10(-10) post-correction Bit-Error Rate (BER). The designed system can be accessed and controlled by a computer with a user-friendly graphical interface. The proposed wireless implantable recording device was tested in vitro using real icEEG signals from two patients with refractory epilepsy. The wirelessly recorded signals were compared to the original signals recorded using wired-connection, and measured normalized root-mean square deviation was under 2%.

Deficits in such abilities have been suggested as a possible source for certain atypical social behaviors manifested by persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In the present study, we assessed the recognition and integration of emotional expressions in ASD using a validated set of ecological stimuli comprised of dynamic visual and auditory (non-verbal) vocal clips. Autistic participants and typically developing controls (TD) were asked to discriminate between clips depicting expressions of disgust and fear presented either visually, auditorily or audio-visually. The group of autistic participants was less efficient to discriminate emotional expressions across all conditions (unimodal and bimodal). Moreover, they necessitated a higher signal-to-noise ratio for the discrimination of visual or auditory presentations of disgust versus fear expressions. These results suggest an altered sensitivity to emotion expressions in this population that is not modality-specific. In addition, the group of autistic participants benefited from exposure to bimodal information to a lesser extent than did the TD group, indicative of a decreased multisensory gain in this population. These results are the first to compellingly demonstrate joint alterations for both the perception and the integration of multisensory emotion expressions in ASD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to test how these neural mechanisms are solicited in aging in the context of visual selective attention processing and whether they are interor intra-hemispheric. Younger and older participants were scanned using fMRI during a visual letter-matching task with two attentional load levels. The results show that in the low-load condition, the older participants activated frontal superior gyri bilaterally; these regions were not activated in the younger participants, in accordance with the compensation mechanism and the Posterior-Anterior Shift in Aging (PASA) phenomenon. However, when task demand increased, the older participants recruited the same regions (parietal) as the younger ones, showing the involvement of a similar neural reserve mechanism. This result suggests that successful cognitive aging relies on the concurrent use of both neural compensation and neural reserve in high-demand tasks, calling on the frontoparietal network. In addition, the finding of intra-hemispheric-based neurofunctional reorganization with a PASA phenomenon for all attentional load levels suggests that the PASA phenomenon is a function more of compensation than of reserve.

Methods: Twenty patients with HFREF (aged 61 +/- 9.9 years) were randomly assigned to HIIE corresponding to 2 x 8 minutes of 30-second intervals at 100% of peak power output and 30-second passive recovery intervals and to a 22-minute MICE corresponding to 60% of peak power output. Gas exchange, electrocardiogram, and blood pressure were measured continuously. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured before, 20 minutes after, and 24 hours after HIIE and MICE. Results: Cardiopulmonary responses did not differ between MICE and HIIE. Higher exercise adherence and efficiency were observed on HIIE with a similar perceived exertion and time spent above 90% of peak oxygen consumption compared with MICE. Neither HIIE nor MICE caused any significant arrhythmias or increased CRP, BNP, or cTnT. Conclusions: Compared with MICE, HIIE demonstrated a higher exercise adherence and was well tolerated in patients with HFREF, while still providing a high-level physiological stimulus and leaving indices of inflammation (CRP), myocardial dysfunction (BNP), and myocardial necrosis (cTnT) unaffected.

Rapid EEG Activity during Sleep Dominates in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Patients with Acute Pain	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						electroencephalography; mild traumatic brain injury; pain; sleep	EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; CATASTROPHIZING SCALE; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; HEAD-INJURY; INSOMNIA; COMPLAINTS; DISTURBANCES; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; ADULTS	Chronic pain is a highly prevalent post-concussion symptom occurring in a majority of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). About half of patients with mTBI report sleep-wake disturbances. It is known that pain can alter sleep quality in this population, but the interaction between pain and sleep is not fully understood. This study aimed to identify how pain affects subjective sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), sleep architecture, and quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) brain activity after mTBI. Twenty-four mTBI patients complaining of sleep-wake disturbances, with and without pain (8 and 16, respectively), were recruited 45 (+/- 22.7) days post-trauma on average. Data were compared with those of 18 healthy controls (no sleep or pain complaints). The PSQI, sleep architecture, and qEEG activity were analyzed. Pain was assessed using questionnaires and a 100-mm visual analogue scale. Patients with mTBI reported three times poorer sleep quality than controls on the PSQI. Sleep architecture significantly differed between patients with mTBI and controls but was within normal range. Global qEEG showed lower delta (deep sleep) and higher beta and gamma power (arousal) at certain EEG derivations in patients with mTBI compared with controls (p < 0.04). Patients with mTBI with pain, however, showed greater increase in rapid EEG frequency bands, mostly during REM sleep, and beta bands in non-REM sleep compared with patients with mTBI without pain and controls (p < 0.001). Pain in patients with mTBI was associated with more rapid qEEG activity, mostly during REM sleep, suggesting that pain is associated with poor sleep and is a critical factor in managing post-concussion symptoms.

Iodine and Mental Development of Children 5 Years Old and Under: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	NUTRIENTS			English	Review						children; iodine; mental development; systematic review; meta-analysis	MATERNAL THYROID-FUNCTION; CONGENITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; PRETERM INFANTS; TRANSIENT HYPOTHYROXINEMIA; PSYCHOMOTOR DEVELOPMENT; NEUROLOGIC DEVELOPMENT; ENDEMIC CRETINISM; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; EARLY-PREGNANCY	Several reviews and meta-analyses have examined the effects of iodine on mental development. None focused on young children, so they were incomplete in summarizing the effects on this important age group. The current systematic review therefore examined the relationship between iodine and mental development of children 5 years old and under. A systematic review of articles using Medline (1980-November 2011) was carried out. We organized studies according to four designs: (1) randomized controlled trial with iodine supplementation of mothers; (2) non-randomized trial with iodine supplementation of mothers and/or infants; (3) prospective cohort study stratified by pregnant women's iodine status; (4) prospective cohort study stratified by newborn iodine status. Average effect sizes for these four designs were 0.68 (2 RCT studies), 0.46 (8 non-RCT studies), 0.52 (9 cohort stratified by mothers' iodine status), and 0.54 (4 cohort stratified by infants' iodine status). This translates into 6.9 to 10.2 IQ points lower in iodine deficient children compared with iodine replete children. Thus, regardless of study design, iodine deficiency had a substantial impact on mental development. Methodological concerns included weak study designs, the omission of important confounders, small sample sizes, the lack of cluster analyses, and the lack of separate analyses of verbal and non-verbal subtests. Quantifying more precisely the contribution of iodine deficiency to delayed mental development in young children requires more well-designed randomized controlled trials, including ones on the role of iodized salt.

HC charts currently used in Canada are either dated, mixed-gender, nonrepresentative of lower gestational ages (GAs), or reflective of other populations. METHODS: To create both birth weight and HC curves, we combined weight and HC data from the Canadian Neonatal Network (CNN) database (admissions in NICUs across Canada) with McGill's Obstetrical Neonatal Database (MOND; all births at a tertiary hospital in Montreal, Canada). We included CNN data for GAs of 23 to 34 weeks (2003-2007) and MOND data for GAs of 35 to 41 weeks (1995-2006). Nonsingletons, congenital anomalies, and measurements greater than +/- 4 SD from the mean were excluded. Distributions of birth weight and HC at each GA were statistically (penalized spline regression) smoothed. Birth weight curves were compared with recent Canadian reference curves and HC curves with historical and/or frequently used curves. RESULTS: We included 39 896 births (3121 births at,30 weeks' GA) to generate the curves. Current weight curves were similar to Canadian reference charts for both genders. Weight and HC measurements in boys were higher than in girls. When classified according to recent international references, the proportion of CNN-MOND infants at >= 32 weeks' GA with HCs < 10th percentile was significantly underestimated. When classified according to historical reference curves, a significant number of CNN-MOND infants of all GAs with HCs <10th and >90th percentiles were misclassified. CONCLUSIONS: We developed recent gender-specific reference curves for HC at birth for singletons at 23 to 41 completed weeks' GA, which included a large number of very premature infants, reflecting the current geotemporal Canadian population.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Of 8640 subjects who met inclusion criteria, 75% (N-1 = 6480) were randomly selected to provide training set for constructing artificial neural network (ANN) and multivariate logistic regression (MLR) models. The remaining 25% (N-2 = 2160) were assigned to validation set for performance comparisons of the ANN and MLR models. Predictive performance of different models was analyzed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using the validation set. Results: The prevalence rates of T2DM were 8.66% (n = 561) and 9.21% (n = 199) in training and validation sets, respectively. For ANN model, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for identifying T2DM were 86.93%, 79.14%, 31.86%, and 98.18%, respectively, while MLR model were only 60.80%, 75.48%, 21.78%, and 94.52%, respectively. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) value for identifying T2DM when using the ANN model was 0.891, showing more accurate predictive performance than the MLR model (AUC = 0.744) (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: The ANN model is an effective classification approach for identifying those at high risk of T2DM based on demographic, lifestyle and anthropometric data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To date, many studies have focused on identifying risk and protective factors occurring at all levels of the ecology. However, more distal-level variables, such as culture and ethnicity, have not been studied as much as those of more proximal levels; yet studies in Western countries have consistently found an overrepresentation of child maltreatment reports among ethnic minority groups. In this commentary, we reflect on a series of articles examining maltreatment from a crosscultural perspective and using samples of diverse countries. Taken together, studies in this special section document the terrible fact that maltreatment is a global phenomenon. Through a summary of these studies' main findings and concerns, we highlight four key points that we believe are important to consider for future research and intervention efforts.

The interviewer was an athlete who had suffered multiple concussions, and the interviewees were five former National Hockey League athletes who had retired due to medically diagnosed concussions suffered during their careers. The men discussed the physical and psychological symptoms they experienced as a result of their concussions and how the symptoms affected their professional careers, personal relationships, and quality of life. The former professional athletes related these symptoms to the turmoil that is ever present in their lives. These findings are of interest to athletes, coaches, sport administrators, family members, sport psychology practitioners, and medical professionals, as they highlight the severity of short-and long-term effects of concussions.

We quantified the differential mortality rates of nonsex specific cancers between the sexes and compared cancer stage distributions. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive epidemiological study we obtained the incidence of new cancer cases, cancer deaths and stage distributions for the last 10 years in the United States from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) program results. Sex specific cancers were excluded from study. We compared male-to-female relative mortality rate for all cancers as well as the average male-to-female relative mortality rate weighted by cancer incidence in the last 10 years. Sex specific stage distributions were also compared with the Kendall tau-c test. Results: The male-to-female relative mortality rate for any cancer was 1.060 (95% CI 1.055-1.065). The average male-to-female relative mortality rate for the same cancer was 1.126 (95% CI 1.086-1.168). The discrepancy in incidence and mortality rates was stable for the last 10 years. Of the top 10 most common cancers men had an unfavorable stage distribution in all except colorectal, bladder and brain cancers. Conclusions: Men are more likely to have nonsex specific cancer than women and more likely to die of the cancer even after controlling for the incidence. This discrepancy has been stable for the last decade. For 7 of the 10 most commonly occurring nonsex specific cancers, representing 78% of all incident cancers, men are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage.

Although the actual mechanism(s) that lead to the selective histological lesions characteristic of this disorder remain unresolved, oxidative stress has been shown to play a major role in its pathophysiology. In this review, the multifactorial influence of oxidative stress on a variety of processes known to take part in the development of structural lesions in TD including excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier integrity, mitochondria] integrity, apoptosis, nucleic acid function, and neural stem cells will be discussed, and therapeutic strategies undertaken for treating neurodegeneration examined which may have an impact on the future treatment of this important vitamin deficiency.

However, scientific inquiry into the neurochemical effects of music is still in its infancy. In this review, we evaluate the evidence that music improves health and well-being through the engagement of neurochemical systems for (i) reward, motivation, and pleasure; (ii) stress and arousal; (iii) immunity; and (iv) social affiliation. We discuss the limitations of these studies and outline novel approaches for integration of conceptual and technological advances from the fields of music cognition and social neuroscience into studies of the neurochemistry of music.

Oral prophylactic treatments may act with a significant delay, cause side effects, or fail to control the attacks. Injections targeting the occipital nerve have raised interest for the management of CH. Their efficacy is thought to result from the anatomical convergence of trigeminal and cervical afferents in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Efficacy and safety of occipital injections are now documented by 2 randomized controlled trials and several case series, though the optimal technique and substance to be injected are still subject to discussion due to varied approaches in the published studies. The evidence supports the use of injected steroids, with or without the addition of an anesthetic. Side effects of local pain are common, but unlikely to be severe. Systemic effects related to steroid absorption are reported but infrequent. Occipital injections provide a rapid benefit on the frequency of attacks and can be used as an adjunct to an oral prophylactic for a quicker improvement. Whether or not this approach can be used without any oral prophylaxis is still to be determined. The technique is easy to master, has a low cost, and should be learned by physicians involved in CH management.

First published January 23, 2013; doi:10.1152/jn.00719.2012.-Motor learning is reflected in changes to the brain's functional organization as a result of experience. We show here that these changes are not limited to motor areas of the brain and indeed that motor learning also changes sensory systems. We test for plasticity in sensory systems using somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). A robotic device is used to elicit somatosensory inputs by displacing the arm in the direction of applied force during learning. We observe that following learning there are short latency changes to the response in somatosensory areas of the brain that are reliably correlated with the magnitude of motor learning: subjects who learn more show greater changes in SEP magnitude. The effects we observe are tied to motor learning. When the limb is displaced passively, such that subjects experience similar movements but without experiencing learning, no changes in the evoked response are observed. Sensorimotor adaptation thus alters the neural coding of somatosensory stimuli.

It is unclear whether the problem arises from the progenitor spermatogonial stem cells (for example, from an accumulation of DNA damage and mutations), from the somatic niche present in the testis (consisting of Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells), or from a combination of the two. Current data, albeit from a small number of studies, suggest that both factors have a role in age-associated germ cell loss. What is clear, on the other hand, is that mounting evidence links paternal age to chromosomal damage and genetic problems in the children of older fathers. The frequency of de novo mutations increases markedly with age, leading to increased risk of breast cancer, cardiac defects, developmental disorders, behavioural disorders, and neurological disease in the children of older men. The current trend towards fathering children at a later age raises concerns regarding the risk of offspring developing complex multigene diseases.

The disruption of dopaminergic projections in Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to an imbalance within these circuits, leading to motor and cognitive symptoms. The cortico-cerebellar (CC) network has often been viewed as a compensatory network, helping the dysfunction of the cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuits in PD. However, evidence for this compensatory role is scarce; most changes in cerebellar activity could equally be attributed to pathophysiological changes underlying PD. This paper will review the anatomy, interaction and function of the CBG and CC circuits, the pathophysiological, metabolic, and functional changes observed in PD, as well as the effect of levodopa and deep brain stimulation on these changes. We will use this framework to discuss the pathophysiological and compensatory mechanisms behind CBG and CC circuit activity in PD.

J	Hutchins, S; Peretz, I				Hutchins, Sean; Peretz, Isabelle			Vocal pitch shift in congenital amusia (pitch deafness)	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Perception; Production; Dissociation; Congenital amusia; Pitch shift	TONE-DEAFNESS; FUNDAMENTAL-FREQUENCY; MUSICAL DISORDERS; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; FEEDBACK; RESPONSES; DISCRIMINATION; MISMATCH; STREAMS	We tested whether congenital amusics, who exhibit pitch perception deficits, nevertheless adjust the pitch of their voice in response to a sudden pitch shift applied to vocal feedback. Nine amusics and matched controls imitated their own previously-recorded speech or singing, while the online feedback they received was shifted mid-utterance by 25 or 200 cents. While a few amusics failed to show pitch-shift effects, a majority showed a pitch-shift response and nearly half showed a normal response to both large and small shifts, with similar magnitudes and response times as controls. The size and presence of the shift response to small shifts were significantly predicted by participants' vocal pitch matching accuracy, rather than their ability to perceive small pitch changes. The observed dissociation between the ability to consciously perceive small pitch changes and to produce and monitor vocal pitch provides evidence for a dual-route model of pitch processing in the brain.

Our study sought to assess the impact of the initiation of memantine or cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) on the use of antipsychotics. Method: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Quebec provincial health plan database. Patients included in our study had received a diagnosis of AD and were initial users of memantine or ChEIs. The proportion of patients who used antipsychotics was estimated using prescription data dating back to 1 year before and to 1 year after the first prescription of memantine or ChEIs. The difference between the slopes corresponding to the periods pre- and postmemantine or ChEIs was analyzed using an interrupted time series design. Results: The percentage of antipsychotic users increased by 118.3% before and by 68.3% after initiation of a ChEI, and increased by 68.6% before and by 7.0% after initiation of memantine. Antipsychotic trends pre- and post-ChEI initiation were not statistically different (P = 0.89), while a statistical difference was observed when comparing the antipsychotic trends pre- and postmemantine initiation (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The initiation of memantine, unlike ChEIs, has a notable stabilization effect on the prescription of antipsychotics in patients with AD.

Our study aims to assess the risk of DM in new users of antipsychotics. Methods: Our nested case control study used the Quebec Health Insurance Board databases. People in the source cohort were DM-free and had initiated an antipsychotic treatment. Subjects were cohort members who initiated an antidiabetic or had a diagnosis of DM during their follow-up period. Three variables were used to assess antipsychotic exposure: the antipsychotic used (any typical, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or more than 1 drug); the number of 30-day periods of use; and antipsychotic use at index date (current or past). A paired multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios. Results: Among the 88 467 people included in the cohort, 6109 subjects with DM were identified and were matched to 61 090 control subjects. New users of quetiapine were less likely to develop DM than new users of typical antipsychotics (OR, 0.89; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99). The risk of DM was not statistically different across the atypical antipsychotics. A longer exposure to any antipsychotic (for each 30-day period, OR 1.009; 95% 01 1.006 to 1.011) and current use of antipsychotics (OR 1.26; 95% 01 1.17 to 1.36) were associated with DM. Conclusion: These results suggest that metabolic parameters of people exposed to antipsychotics should be monitored, irrespective of the drug taken, among the drugs available at the time of analysis.

Depletion of the novel p53-target gene carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C delays tumor growth in the neurofibromatosis type I tumor model	CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION			English	Article						carnitine palmitoyltransferase; carcinogenesis; p53; metabolism; AMPK	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; FATTY-ACID-METABOLISM; ENERGY SENSOR; CELL-SURVIVAL; P53; CANCER; HYPOXIA; STRESS; TRANSCRIPTION; HOMEOSTASIS	Despite the prominent pro-apoptotic role of p53, this protein has also been shown to promote cell survival in response to metabolic stress. However, the specific mechanism by which p53 protects cells from metabolic stress-induced death is unknown. Earlier we reported that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C), a brain-specific member of a family of mitochondria-associated enzymes that have a central role in fatty acid metabolism promotes cell survival and tumor growth. Unlike other members of the CPT family, the subcellular localization of CPT1C and its cellular function remains elusive. Here, we report that CPT1C is a novel p53-target gene with a bona fide p53-responsive element within the first intron. CPT1C is upregulated in vitro and in vivo in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, expression of CPT1C is induced by metabolic stress factors such as hypoxia and glucose deprivation in a p53 and AMP activated kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, in a murine tumor model, depletion of Cpt1c leads to delayed tumor development and a striking increase in survival. Taken together, our results indicate that p53 protects cells from metabolic stress via induction of CPT1C and that CPT1C may have a crucial role in carcinogenesis. CPT1C may therefore represent an exciting new therapeutic target for the treatment of hypoxic and otherwise treatment-resistant tumors.

Design and methods: The described method coupled mass spectrometric immunoassay (MSIA), a previously developed technique for immunoenrichment on a monolithic microcolumn activated with an anti-protein antibody and fixed in a pipette tip, to selected reaction monitoring (SRM) detection and accurate quantification of targeted peptides, including clinically relevant sequence or truncated variants. Results: In this report, we demonstrate the rapid development of MSIA-SRM assays for sixteen different target proteins spanning seven different clinically important areas (including neurological, Alzheimer's, cardiovascular, endocrine function, cancer and other diseases) and ranging in concentration from pg/mL to mg/mL. The reported MSIA-SRM assays demonstrated high sensitivity (within published clinical ranges), precision, robustness and high-throughput as well as specific detection of clinically relevant isoforms for many of the target proteins. Most of the assays were tested with bona-fide clinical samples. In addition, positive correlations, (R2 0.67-0.87, depending on the target peptide), were demonstrated for MSIA-SRM assay data with clinical analyzer measurements of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1) in clinical sample cohorts. Conclusions: We have presented a practical and scalable method for rapid development and deployment of MS-based SRM assays for clinically relevant proteins and measured levels of the target analytes in bona fide clinical samples. The method permits the specific quantification of individual protein isoforms and addresses the difficult problem of protein heterogeneity in clinical proteomics applications.

However, distinctive characteristics defining the group of children at risk for negative outcomes are not well established. In the following study, children from 6 to 59 months with a history of atypical FSs were investigated using steady state visual evoked potentials (ssVEP), a brain response known to increase with age. Abnormally, low theta and alpha ssVEP brain responses were found in children with a history of atypical FSs. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The extent to which dopamine dysfunction affects connectivity within this and other brain networks remains to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to measure anatomical and functional connectivity in groups of PD patients and controls to determine whether connectivity deficits within the corticobasal ganglia thalamocortical system could be attributed to PD, particularly in sensorimotor connections. A neuroimaging paradigm involving diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI was implemented in a large cohort of PD patients and control subjects. Probabilistic tractography and functional correlation analyses were performed to map connections between brain structures and to derive indices of connectivity that were then used to compare groups. Anatomical connectivity deficits were demonstrated in PD patients, specifically for sensorimotor connections. Functional deficits were also found in some of the same connections. In addition, functional connectivity was found to increase in associative and limbic connections in PD patients compared with controls. This study lends support to findings regarding the dysfunction of the sensorimotor circuit in PD. As deficits in anatomical and functional connectivity within this circuit were in some cases concordant in PD patients, a possible link between brain structure and function is suggested. Increases in functional connectivity in other corticobasal ganglia thalamocortical circuits may be indicative of compensatory effects in response to system deficits elsewhere.

Twenty-seven statements were drafted and subjected to online Delphi consensus voting by participants, seeking 70 agreement from 60 of respondents; where 70 consensus occurred, the statement was modified and resubmitted for voting. Twenty-seven statements meeting consensus criteria are reported. For HCLGG, statements describing overall therapeutic purposeand indications for biopsy, observation, or treatment aimed at limiting the risk of visual damage and the need for on-going clinical trials were made. Primary surgical resection was not recommended. For DIPG, biopsy was recommended to ascertain biological characteristics to enhance understanding and targeting of treatments, especially in clinical trials. For HGG, biopsy is essential, the World Health Organization classification was recommended; selection of surgical strategy to achieve gross total resection in a single or multistep process should be discussed with the PNMDT and integrated with trials based drug strategies for adjuvant therapies.

High Prevalence of Angiotropism in Congenital Melanocytic Nevi: An Analysis of 53 Cases	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY			English	Article						angiotropism; congenital melanocytic nevi; extravascular migration; neural crest; melanoma metastasis		The mechanisms responsible for the development of congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) have yet to be elucidated. A potential clue to their origin is the observation of angiotropism of nevus cells in CMN. Interestingly, neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), the precursors of melanocytes, demonstrate angiotropism in the embryo. There is accumulating evidence that NCSCs migrate along the external surfaces of vessels during a portion of their journey to the skin. Comparable angiotropism and migration of melanoma cells have been described as extravascular migratory metastasis in melanoma. In this report, we systematically examined for the first time, the frequency of angiotropism in 53 CMN. The lesions originated from 27 females and 26 males with an average age of 9.81 years (range 0.42-28 years). The mean nevus size was 7.43 cm (range 0.3-40 cm). Twenty-seven (50.9%) of the 53 lesions were less than 1.5 cm in diameter. Sixteen nevi (30.2%) were medium sized (1.5-19.9 cm), and 10 CMN (18.9%) were large/giant (>20 cm in diameter). The trunk was the most common location (23/53) followed by the head and neck (17/53). Thirty-eight (71.7%) of the 53 lesions were compound melanocytic nevi, and 15 (28.3%) of the 53 lesions were dermal nevi. In summary, angiotropism was observed in 50 (94.3%) of 53 cases. Consequently, such angiotropism may potentially explain the origin of the precursor cells giving rise to CMN. Further explanations concerning dysregulated growth are clearly needed for the actual appearance of CMN and their physical characteristics.

However, a dose-response relationship has not yet been established. In this study, we compared the effects of 0.7 and 1.4 g.kg(-1) mannitol on brain relaxation during elective supratentorial brain tumor surgery. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we enrolled 80 patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy for tumor resection. Patients were assigned to receive 0.7 g.kg(-1) (group L) or 1.4 g.kg(-1) (group H) of 20% mannitol at surgical incision. Brain relaxation was assessed immediately after opening of the dura on a scale ranging from 1 to 4 (1 = perfectly relaxed, 2 = satisfactorily relaxed, 3 = firm brain, 4 = bulging brain). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding age, sex, body mass index, and brain tumor localization or size. In group L 52.5% of patients and in group H 77.5% of patients presented a midline shift (P = 0.03). The median scores of brain relaxation (interquantile range) were 2.0 (1.75-3) and 2.0 (1-3) (P = 0.16 for patients. in group L and H, respectively). We then used a proportional odds model to adjust for this unbalanced distribution and to assess the group effect (low-dose versus high-dose mannitol) on brain relaxation scores. When adjusted for the presence of midline shift, the use of a higher dose of mannitol resulted in an odds ratio of 2.5 (P = 0.03). This indicates that, considering the effect of a midline shift, the odds of having a 1-level improvement in relaxation score in patients who received a higher dose of mannitol (group H) was 2.5 times as large as the odds for the low-dose group. The odds ratio of 0.29 (P = 0.007) for the midline shift indicates that its occurrence was associated with a higher probability of a lower relaxation score, on average. CONCLUSION: In this study, we show that 1.4 g.kg(-1) of 20% mannitol results in equivalent brain relaxation scores as 0.7 g.kg(-1) in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumor. When corrected for the presence of midline shift, this study reveals that patients in the high-dose group had significantly more chances of obtaining a better relaxation score compared with the lower-dose group.

J	Moreau, P; Jolicoeur, P; Peretz, I				Moreau, Patricia; Jolicoeur, Pierre; Peretz, Isabelle			Pitch discrimination without awareness in congenital amusia: Evidence from event-related potentials	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Congenital amusia; Pitch perception; Auditory ERPs	BRAIN RESPONSES; TONE-DEAFNESS; MISMATCH; NEUROSCIENCE; MUSIC; P300; TUNE; ERP	Congenital amusia is a lifelong disorder characterized by a difficulty in perceiving and producing music despite normal intelligence and hearing. Behavioral data have indicated that it originates from a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and is expressed by the absence of a P3b event-related brain response for pitch differences smaller than a semitone and a bigger N2b-P3b brain response for large pitch differences as compared to controls. However, it is still unclear why the amusic brain overreacts to large pitch changes. Furthermore, another electrophysiological study indicates that the amusic brain can respond to changes in melodies as small as a quarter-tone, without awareness, by exhibiting a normal mismatch negativity (MMN) brain response. Here, we re-examine the event-related N2b-P3b components with the aim to clarify the cause of the larger amplitude observed by Peretz, Brattico, and Tervaniemi (2005), by experimentally matching the number of deviants presented to the controls according to the number of deviants detected by amusics. We also re-examine the MMN component as well as the N1 in an acoustical context to investigate further the pitch discrimination deficit underlying congenital amusia. In two separate conditions, namely ignore and attend, we measured the MMN, the N1, the N2b and the P3b to tones that deviated by an eight of a tone (25 cents) or whole tone (200 cents) from a repeated standard tone. The results show a normal MMN, a seemingly normal N1, a normal P3b for the 200 cents pitch deviance, and no P3b for the small 25 cents pitch differences in amusics. These results indicate that the amusic brain responds to small pitch differences at a pre-attentive level of perception, but is unable to detect consciously those same pitch deviances at a later attentive level. The results are consistent with previous MRI and fMRI studies indicating that the auditory cortex of amusic individuals is functioning normally. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Stretch reflex spatial threshold measure discriminates between spasticity and rigidity	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Spasticity; Rigidity; Measurement; Stroke; Parkinson's disease; Parkinsonism; Stretch reflex	EQUILIBRIUM-POINT HYPOTHESIS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; ELBOW FLEXORS; MOTOR CONTROL; FLEXION MOVEMENTS; FUSIMOTOR SYSTEM; STROKE PATIENTS; UPPER-LIMB; MUSCLE	Objective: Muscle spasticity following stroke has been shown to result from limitations in the range of regulation of the tonic reflex spatial threshold (ST), i.e., the joint angle at which the stretch reflex begins to act due to descending and segmental influences on motoneurons. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spasticity due to stroke and rigidity due to parkinsonism can be discriminated based on the ST measure. Methods: Elbow muscles were stretched at different velocities in healthy, stroke (spasticity) and parkinsonism (rigidity) subjects. The elbow angle at which muscle activation began for each stretch velocity (dynamic ST) and the velocity sensitivity of the ST were measured. Dynamic ST values extrapolated to zero velocity defined the tonic ST. Results: Compared to healthy subjects, spasticity and rigidity were associated with a decrease in the range of central regulation of tonic STs. STs were hypersensitive in spastic muscles and either hypo- or inversely sensitive to stretch velocity in rigid muscles. Conclusions: ST characteristics discriminate between neurological deficits of muscle tone. Significance: Results suggest that spasticity and rigidity result from deficits in descending facilitatory control combined with deficits in dynamic fusimotor or/and presynaptic control of Ia inputs to motoneurons.

Both may be associated with sedative or opiate doses and pharmacokinetic or pharmacogenetic variables, such as drug plasma levels (exposure), drug metabolism, and/or their transport across the blood-brain barrier. Objectives: To compare biological and drug treatment characteristics in patients with coma and/or delirium while in the ICU. Patients and Measurements: In 99 patients receiving IV fentanyl, midazolam, or both, we evaluated drug doses, covariates likely to influence drug effects (age, body mass index, and renal and hepatic dysfunction); delirium risk factors; concomitant administration of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein substrates/inhibitors; ABCB1, ABCG2, and CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms; and fentanyl and midazolam plasma levels. Delirium and coma were evaluated daily. In patients with only coma (n = 15), only delirium (n = 7), and neither ever (n = 14), we measured plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. Results: Time to first coma was associated with fentanyl and midazolam doses (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). The number of days in coma was associated with the number of days of coadministration of CYP3A inhibitors (r = 0.30; p = 0.006). Plasma levels of fentanyl were higher in patients with clinical coma (3.7 +/- 4.7 vs. 2.0 +/- 1.8 ng/mL, p = 0.0001) as were midazolam plasma levels (1050 +/- 2232 vs. 168 +/- 249 ng/mL, p = 0.0001). Delirium occurrence was unrelated to midazolam administration, cumulative doses, or serum levels. Days with delirium were associated with days of coadministration of P-glycoprotein inhibitor (r = 0.35; p = 0.0004). Delirious patients had higher levels of the inflammatory mediator IL-6 than comatose patients (129.3 vs. 35.0 pg/mL, p = 0.05). Conclusions: Coma is associated with fentanyl and midazolam exposure; delirium is unrelated to midazolam and may be linked to inflammatory status. These data suggest that iatrogenic coma and delirium are not mechanistically linked.

The hypothesis that similar electrographic epileptiform patterns occur in vivo following systemic 4AP injection was tested here. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats (n=13) were implanted with bipolar electrodes aimed at the hippocampal CA3 region, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, dentate gyrus, and amygdala. They were then injected with a single dose of 4AP (45mg/kg, i.p.), and video-monitoring/electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were performed. Key Findings: 4AP induced convulsive or nonconvulsive seizures in 12 of 13 rats, along with generalized fascicular twitching, wet-dog shakes, and myoclonic jerks. On EEG, we observed in 7 (58.3%) of 12 animals long-lasting interictal spikes from the subiculum before the occurrence of the first seizure. Once seizures had started, interictal spikes occurred in all areas with no fixed site of origin. Most seizures (41/60, 68.3%) were characterized by a low-voltage fast-activity onset pattern and were convulsive (48/60, 80%). 4AP also induced highly rhythmic theta (611Hz) oscillations in CA3 and entorhinal cortex before seizure occurrence. Significance: Our study shows that systemic 4AP administration in vivo can enhance theta oscillations and induce slow interictal spikes and low-voltage fast-onset seizures similar to those reported in brain slices. We propose that these effects may reflect, at least in part, enhanced GABAA receptormediated inhibition as reported in in vitro studies.

We have recently found that systemic (arterial) application of the potassium channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (4AP), induces different and independent seizure activities in olfactory and in limbic structures. Here, we have characterized the network and cellular features that support 4AP-induced seizure-like events in the olfactory cortex. Methods Simultaneous extracellular recordings were performed from the piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the olfactory tubercle, and the amygdala of the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain preparation. Intracellular, sharp electrode recordings were obtained from neurons of different layers of the region of ictal onset, the piriform cortex. Seizure-like discharges were induced by both arterial perfusion and local intracortical injections of 4AP. Key Findings Arterial application of 4AP induces independent seizure activities in limbic and olfactory cortices. Both local applications of 4AP and cortico-cortical disconnections demonstrated that region-specific seizure-like events initiated in the primary olfactory cortex and propagate to anatomically related areas. Seizures induced by arterial administration of 4-AP are preceded by runs of fast activity at circa 3040Hz and are independently generated in the hemispheres. Simultaneous extracellular and intracellular recordings in the piriform cortex revealed that the onset of seizure correlates with (1) a gradual amplitude increase of fast activity runs, (2) a large intracellular depolarization with action potential firing of superficial layer neurons, and (3) no firing in a subpopulation of deep layers neurons. During the ictal event, neuronal firing was abolished for 1030s in all neurons and gradually restored and synchronized before seizure termination. Significance Our data show that olfactory neuronal networks sustain the generation of seizure-like activities that are independent from those observed in adjacent and connected limbic cortex regions. The data support the concept that functionally and anatomically hard-wired networks generate region-specific seizure patterns that could be substrates for system epilepsy.

A Phase 3 Trial of Whole Brain Radiation Therapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Alone Versus WBRT and SRS With Temozolomide or Erlotinib for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and 1 to 3 Brain Metastases: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0320	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-Cancer-Research	MAR 31-APR 04, 2012	Chicago, IL	Amer Assoc Canc Res			RANDOMIZED-TRIAL	Background: A phase 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study subset analysis demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) with the addition of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases. Because temozolomide (TMZ) and erlotinib (ETN) cross the blood-brain barrier and have documented activity in NSCLC, a phase 3 study was designed to test whether these drugs would improve the OS associated with WBRT + SRS. Methods and Materials: NSCLC patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases were randomized to receive WBRT (2.5 Gy x 15 to 37.5 Gy) and SRS alone, versus WBRT + SRS + TMZ (75 mg/m(2)/day x 21 days) or ETN (150 mg/day). ETN (150 mg/day) or TMZ (150-200 mg/m(2)/day x 5 days/month) could be continued for as long as 6 months after WBRT + SRS. The primary endpoint was OS. Results: After 126 patients were enrolled, the study closed because of accrual limitations. The median survival times (MST) for WBRT + SRS, WBRT + SRS + TMZ, and WBRT + SRS + ETN were qualitatively different (13.4, 6.3, and 6.1 months, respectively), although the differences were not statistically significant. Time to central nervous system progression and performance status at 6 months were better in the WBRT + SRS arm. Grade 3 to 5 toxicity was 11%, 41%, and 49% in arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P<.001). Conclusion: The addition of TMZ or ETN to WBRT + SRS in NSCLC patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases did not improve survival and possibly had a deleterious effect. Because the analysis is underpowered, these data suggest but do not prove that increased toxicity was the cause of inferior survival in the drug arms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Incidence of ethambutol-related visual impairment during treatment of active tuberculosis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Review						eye toxicity; blindness; tuberculosis treatment; systematic review; meta-analysis	PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; OPTIC NEUROPATHY; OCULAR TOXICITY; METAANALYSIS; BLINDNESS; REGIMENS	BACKGROUND: Recent World Health Organization guidelines recommend the addition of ethambutol (EMB) throughout standardised treatment of new cases of active tuberculosis (TB) in populations with increased prevalence of isoniazid resistance to reduce the risk of creating multidrug resistance. This could expose patients to the risk of blindness. METHODS: We searched Cochrane, Embase and PubMed electronic databases from 1965 to February 2011 for original studies that prospectively followed all patients treated with EMB for active TB, and routinely ascertained the occurrence of visual toxicity using standard methods. Pooled estimates, overall and stratified by major covariates, were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Pooled cumulative incidence of any visual impairment in all patients was 22.5 per 1000 persons treated with EMB (95%CI 10.2-35), and permanent impairment was 4.3/1000 (95%CI 0.3-9.0). After restricting the analyses to arms in which the average dose was 27.5 mg/kg/day or less and treatment was for 2-9 months, the incidence of any visual impairment was 19.2/1000 (95%CI 5.8-33), and permanent impairment was 2.3/1000 persons (95%CI 0-6.1) treated, as the majority of episodes were reversible. In reversible cases, resolution of impairment occurred after an average of 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, any visual impairment occurred in 22.5/1000 persons receiving EMB at standard doses for up to 9 months, and permanent impairment in 2.3/1000-an important risk. However, these estimates are imprecise, and the studies were of variable quality and the results heterogeneous. Well-designed prospective studies with repeated measurements of multiple visual parameters that clearly describe the degree of permanent impairment are needed.

Despite some propositions arguing that low, as well as high levels of personality traits are maladaptive tendencies, only the negative linear relationship between neuroticism and couple satisfaction has been addressed in past research. The aim of this study was to examine the nonlinear association between neuroticism and dyadic adjustment for both partners of a clinically distressed sample of couples. The sample included 472 couples seeking couple therapy who completed the NEO-FFI (P. T. Costa & R. R. McCrae, 1992, NEO PI-R professional manual, Odessa, FL, Psychological Assessment Resources) and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (G. B. Spanier, 1976, Measuring dyadic adjustment: New scales for assessing the quality of marriage and similar dyads, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 38, pp. 15-28). Results showed, for actor and partner effects, a significant nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship between neuroticism and dyadic adjustment. In particular, both very low levels and high levels of neuroticism were associated with lower dyadic adjustment for both the individual and his or her partner. This finding is in contrast with the traditional negative linear association between neuroticism and dyadic adjustment observed in previous research. Openness and agreeableness also positively predicted self and partner dyadic adjustment. Findings bear important clinical implications for therapists assessing and working with distressed couples.

The nucleus prepositus predominantly outputs eye movement-related information during passive and active self-motion. J Neurophysiol 109: 1900-1911, 2013. First published January 16, 2013; doi:10.1152/jn.00788.2012.-Maintaining a constant representation of our heading as we move through the world requires the accurate estimate of spatial orientation. As one turns (or is turned) toward a new heading, signals from the semicircular canals are relayed through the vestibular system to higher-order centers that encode head direction. To date, there is no direct electrophysiological evidence confirming the first relay point of head-motion signals from the vestibular nuclei, but previous anatomical and lesion studies have identified the nucleus prepositus as a likely candidate. Whereas burst-tonic neurons encode only eye-movement signals during head-fixed eye motion and passive vestibular stimulation, these neurons have not been studied during self-generated movements. Here, we specifically address whether burst-tonic neurons encode head motion during active behaviors. Single-unit responses were recorded from the nucleus prepositus of rhesus monkeys and compared for head-restrained and active conditions with comparable eye velocities. We found that neurons consistently encoded eye position and velocity across conditions but did not exhibit significant sensitivity to head position or velocity. Additionally, response sensitivities varied as a function of eye velocity, similar to abducens motoneurons and consistent with their role in gaze control and stabilization. Thus our results demonstrate that the primate nucleus prepositus chiefly encodes eye movement even during active head-movement behaviors, a finding inconsistent with the proposal that this nucleus makes a direct contribution to head-direction cell tuning. Given its ascending projections, however, we speculate that this eye-movement information is integrated with other inputs in establishing higher-order spatial representations.

Here we report a previously unknown signaling pathway that is necessary for the conversion from short- to long-term memory. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), which contains the regulatory protein Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), was discovered only recently and little is known about its function. We found that conditional deletion of Rictor in the postnatal murine forebrain greatly reduced mTORC2 activity and selectively impaired both long-term memory (LTM) and the late phase of hippocampal long-term potentiation (L-LTP). We also found a comparable impairment of LTM in dTORC2-deficient flies, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this pathway. Actin polymerization was reduced in the hippocampus of mTORC2-deficient mice and its restoration rescued both L-LTP and LTM. Moreover, a compound that promoted mTORC2 activity converted early LTP into late LTP and enhanced LTM. Thus, mTORC2 could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.

Predict Sunnybrook ICH CTA Study G	Spot Sign Number Is the Most Important Spot Sign Characteristic for Predicting Hematoma Expansion Using First-Pass Computed Tomography Angiography Analysis From the PREDICT Study	STROKE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Stroke Conference	JAN 31-FEB 03, 2012	New Orleans, LA			computed tomography angiography; intracerebral hemorrhage; prognosis; stroke	PRIMARY INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; CONTRAST EXTRAVASATION; CT ANGIOGRAPHY; GROWTH; OUTCOMES	Background and Purpose-The spot sign score (SSS) provides risk stratification for hematoma expansion in acute intracerebral hemorrhage; however, external validation is needed. We sought to validate the SSS and assess prognostic performance of individual spot characteristics associated with hematoma expansion from a prospective multicenter intracerebral hemorrhage study. Methods-Two hundred twenty-eight intracerebral hemorrhage patients within 6 hours after ictus were enrolled in the Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT (PREDICT) study, a multicenter prospective intracerebral hemorrhage cohort study. Patients were evaluated with baseline noncontrast computerized tomography, computerized tomography angiography, and 24-hour follow-up computerized tomography. Primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion (>6 mL or >33%) and secondary outcome was absolute and relative expansion. Blinded computerized tomography angiography spot sign characterization and SSS calculation were independently performed by 2 neuroradiologists and a radiology resident. Diagnostic performance of the SSS and individual spot characteristics were examined with multivariable regression, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and tests for trend. Results-SSS and spot number independently predicted significant, absolute, and relative hematoma expansion (P<0.05 each) and demonstrated near perfect interobserver agreement (kappa=0.82 and kappa=0.85, respectively). Incremental risk of hematoma expansion among spot-positive patients was not identified for SSS (P trend=0.720) but was demonstrated for spot number (P trend=0.050). Spot number and SSS demonstrated similar area under the curve (0.69 versus 0.68; P=0.306) for hematoma expansion. Conclusions-Multicenter external validation of the SSS demonstrates that the spot number alone provides similar prediction but improved risk stratification of hematoma expansion compared with the SSS.

The first conceptions of cerebral palsy and our knowledge about aetiology and pathogeny allow us to assume that cerebral palsy existed in the Ancient World. Although there is lack of detailed medical descriptions from before the 19th century, mentions to cerebral palsy can be found in representational art, literary sources and paleopathology; however, because of the poor medical documentation, the diagnosis of cerebral palsy must remain a more or less well-justified supposition. In the Ancient World, the first medical description of cerebral palsy was made by Hippocrates in his work "Corpus Hippocraticum". Concrete examples and definitions of cerebral palsy, however, did not emerge until the early 19th century with observations by William John Little; thus, Little was the first personality to intensely engage cerebral palsy. Towards the end of the 19th century, two more personalities emerged, adding to the historical hallmarks of cerebral palsy: William Osler and Sigmund Freud. The significant developments that have followed since then are all due to the contributions of these three personalities in the field of cerebral palsy.

What evidence exists for new strategies or technologies in the diagnosis of sports concussion and assessment of recovery?	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Review							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; PHOTON EMISSION CT; MILD HEAD TRAUMA; FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITIES; IMAGING APPROACH; SPECT; MEG; MRI; TELEMEDICINE	Objective The purpose of this critical review is to summarise the evidence for the following technologies/strategies related to diagnosing or managing sports-related concussion: quantitative EEG, functional neuroimaging, head impact sensors, telemedicine and mobile devices. Data sources MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registers, SportDiscus, EMBASE, Web of Science and ProQuest databases. Primary search keywords were concussion, sports concussion and mild traumatic brain injury. The keywords used for secondary, topic specific searches were quantitative electroencephalography, qEEG, functionalMRI, magnetoencephalography, near-infrared spectroscopy, positron emission tomography, single photon emissionCT, accelerometer, impact sensor, telemetry, remote monitoring, robotic medicine, telemedicine, mobile device, mobile phone, smart phone and tablet computer. Results The primary search produced 8567 publications. The secondary searches produced nine publications that presented original data, included a comparison group in the study design and involved sports-related concussion. Four studies spoke to the potential of qEEG as a diagnostic or management tool, while five studies addressed the potential of fMRI to be used in the same capacity. Conclusions Emerging technologies and novel approaches that aid in sports concussion diagnosis and management are being introduced at a rapid rate. While some technologies show promise, their clinical utility remains to be established.

Here, we demonstrate 2 stages of cerebral processing during voice gender categorization. Using voice morphing along with an adaptation-optimized functional magnetic resonance imaging design, we found that secondary auditory cortex including the anterior part of the temporal voice areas in the right hemisphere responded primarily to acoustical distance with the previously heard stimulus. In contrast, a network of bilateral regions involving inferior prefrontal and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex reflected perceived stimulus ambiguity. These findings suggest that voice gender recognition involves neuronal populations along the auditory ventral stream responsible for auditory feature extraction, functioning in pair with the prefrontal cortex in voice gender perception.

Synaptic activity slows vesicular replenishment at excitatory synapses of rat hippocampus	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Synaptic depression; Time-dependent system; Model fitting; Replenishment rate; Vesicular mobility	READILY RELEASABLE POOL; MOTOR-NERVE TERMINALS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; BRAIN MYOSIN-V; NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE; NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION; TETANIC STIMULATION; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; VESICLE MOBILITY; QUANTAL ANALYSIS	Short-term synaptic depression mainly reflects the depletion of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of quanta. Its dynamics, and especially the replenishment rate of the RRP, are still not well characterized in spite of decades of investigation. Main reason is that the vesicular storage and release system is treated as time-independent. If it is time-dependent all parameters thus estimated become problematic. Indeed the reports about how prolonged stimulation affects the dynamics are contradictory. To study this, we used patterned stimulation on the Schaeffer collateral fiber pathway and model-fitting of the excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSC) recorded from CA1 neurons in rat hippocampal slices. The parameters of a vesicular storage and release model with two pools were estimated by minimizing the squared difference between the ESPC amplitudes and simulated model output. This yields the 'basic' parameters (release coupling, replenishment coupling and RRP size) that underlie the 'derived' and commonly used parameters (fractional release and replenishment rate). The fractional release increases when [Ca++](o) is raised, whereas the replenishment rate is [Ca++](o) independent. Fractional release rises because release coupling increases, and the RRP becomes less able to contain quanta. During prolonged stimulation, the fractional release remains generally unaltered, whereas the replenishment rate decreases down to similar to 10 % of its initial value with a decay time of similar to 15 s, and this decrease in the replenishment rate significantly contributes to synaptic depression. In conclusion, the fractional release is [Ca++](o)-dependent and stimulation-independent, whereas the replenishment rate is [Ca++](o)-independent and stimulation-dependent.

It is characterized by physical and cognitive phenotypes that include motor deficits that may be related to neuroanatomical abnormalities of sensorimotor pathways. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cortical thickness analysis to assess motor cortex excitability and cortical morphology in 17 individuals with TS (45, X) and 17 healthy controls. Exploratory analysis was performed to detect the effect of parental origin of the X chromosome (Xmat, Xpat) on both measures. Results showed that long-interval intracortical inhibition was reduced and motor threshold (MT) was increased in TS relative to controls. Areas of reduced thickness were observed in the precentral gyrus of individuals with TS that correlated with MT. A significant difference between Xmat (n = 11) and Xpat (n = 6) individuals was found on the measure of long-interval intracortical inhibition. These findings demonstrate the presence of converging anatomical and neurophysiological abnormalities of the motor system in X monosomy. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mutations in CLN6 were recently identified in recessive Kufs disease presenting as progressive myoclonus epilepsy (Type A), whereas the molecular basis of cases presenting with dementia and motor features (Type B) is unknown. We performed genome-wide linkage mapping of two families with recessive Type B Kufs disease and identified a single region on chromosome 11 to which both families showed linkage. Exome sequencing of five samples from the two families identified homozygous and compound heterozygous missense mutations in CTSF within this linkage region. We subsequently sequenced CTSF in 22 unrelated individuals with suspected recessive Kufs disease, and identified an additional patient with compound heterozygous mutations. CTSF encodes cathepsin F, a lysosomal cysteine protease, dysfunction of which is a highly plausible candidate mechanism for a storage disorder like ceroid lipofuscinosis. In silico modeling suggested the missense mutations would alter protein structure and function. Moreover, re-examination of a previously published mouse knockout of Ctsf shows that it recapitulates the light and electron-microscopic pathological features of Kufs disease. Although CTSF mutations account for a minority of cases of type B Kufs, CTSF screening should be considered in cases with early-onset dementia and may avoid the need for invasive biopsies.

We asked whether, as in other cricket species, females were able to analyze such a high pulse rate. In phonotaxis experiments, females failed to respond to stimuli with pulse rates substantially higher or lower than the species-typical value, demonstrating that they are indeed selective for this parameter. We also examined how pulse rate was represented by modulation in firing rate of the neuron AN1, the main carrier of information about cricket-song-like stimuli to the brain. For attractive stimuli, i.e. with high pulse rates, modulation of AN1 firing rate through time was surprisingly modest. This suggests that the brain circuits that analyze AN1 spike trains might be more sensitive to slight variations in AN1 firing rate than their counterparts in more slowly singing species.

Psychometric properties of the structured Satisfaction Questionnaire with Gastrostomy Feeding (SAGA-8) for caregivers of children with gastrostomy tube nutritional support	JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS			English	Article						caregiver; child nutrition; enteral nutrition; gastrostomy; nutritional support; satisfaction	PERCUTANEOUS ENDOSCOPIC GASTROSTOMY; HOME ENTERAL NUTRITION; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CEREBRAL-PALSY; PERCEPTIONS; DISABILITY; PLACEMENT; PARENTS; BURDEN	Background To analyse the psychometric properties of the structured Satisfaction Questionnaire with Gastrostomy Feeding (SAGA-8) in parents/caregivers of children with home enteral nutrition (HEN) by gastrostomy tube (GT). Methods Eighty-six caregivers (mothers) of paediatric patients with HEN by GT were recruited. Patients suffered from neurological disease (61.6%) and other chronic diseases. The SAGA-8 scale, a structured questionnaire to explore satisfaction with HEN by GT, and the Caregiver Burden Inventory (Zarit) were completed. The discriminating power of each of the SAGA-8 items, internal consistency and external validity were evaluated. An exploratory factor analysis and KaiserMeyerOlkin (KMO) was performed as well. Results Eighty-four percent of the families expressed high satisfaction with GT feeding. All eight items of SAGA-8 gave additional information. The exploratory factor analysis revealed that a significant part of the items' variability could be explained by two independent factors: Factor 1 (direct benefit), which compiled the variables related to the perception of children's overall improvement by GT feeding; Factor 2 (indirect benefit), which grouped the variables related to a decrease in respiratory infections, feeding time and institutional support. Results from KMO (0.628) indicated the high adequacy of the items assessed in the factorial analysis. Moreover, the questionnaire presented high internal consistency (0.76), and the external validation analysis confirmed the correlation between SAGA-8 and Zarit, thereby emphasising the approptiate use of the SAGA-8 to detect carers' satisfaction. Conclusions The SAGA-8 questionnaire has a high discriminatory power to assess the degree of satisfaction experienced by parents/caregivers of children with HEN by GT and, subsequently, the patients' wellbeing.

Since calcium (Ca2+) overload is a pivotal event in excitotoxic neuronal cell death, we have determined whether XIAP over-expression influences Ca2+-signaling in primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons. Using cortical neuron cultures derived from wild-type (Wt) mice transiently transfected with XIAP or from transgenic mice that over-express XIAP, we show that XIAP opposes the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration by a variety of triggers. Relative to control neurons, XIAP over-expression produced a slight, but significant, elevation of resting Ca2+ concentrations. By contrast, the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations produced by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor stimulation and voltage gated Ca2+ channel activation were markedly attenuated by XIAP over-expression. The release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores induced by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin was also inhibited in neurons transiently transfected with XIAP. The pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD did not, however, diminish the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations elicited by l-glutamate suggesting that XIAP influences Ca2+ signaling in a caspase-independent manner. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the ability of XIAP to block excessive rises in intracellular Ca2+ by a variety of triggers may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of this anti-apoptotic protein.

Current neuroimaging research on these disorders could eventually improve the accuracy of diagnoses and prognoses and therefore change the context of end-of-life decision making. However, the perspective of healthcare professionals on these disorders remains poorly understood and may constitute an obstacle to the integration of research. We conducted a qualitative study involving healthcare professionals from an acute care university medical center. A short questionnaire captured demographic data as well as the experience of participants with DOC patients. A semi-structured interview was used to explore attitudes toward ethical issues identified in a previous literature review. Qualitative content analysis of interviews was conducted with the NVivo software. Accurate diagnosis among DOC is often regarded as a challenge, but this was generally not the case for our participants because most reported high confidence in DOC diagnoses. However, participants reported struggling with prognosis, especially because of its essential role for end-of-life decision making and communication with families. Variability of opinion between healthcare professionals was reported and identified by some as a minor issue while others stressed how families struggle with different medical opinions. End-of-life decision making encompassed a large proportion of ethical challenges in these patients, and the removal of artificial nutrition and hydration created significant discomfort in a minority of participants. The concept of futility was subject to wide-ranging understandings with both favorable and unfavorable opinions. Our data suggest that to ensure the incorporation of new evidence-based advances, attention should be directed to the real-world practices and challenges of accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Given pervasive challenges in end-of-life care, we recommend improved training of healthcare professionals in the care of patients with DOC, particularly in end-of life care, understanding the context of decision making, and determining how to optimally integrate new neuroscience research on the care of patients with DOC.

Pain Perception in Disorders of Consciousness: Neuroscience, Clinical Care, and Ethics in Dialogue	NEUROETHICS			English	Article						Pain; End-of-life; Vegetative state; Minimally conscious state; Ethics; Attitudes; Survey	PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE; LIFE DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN-DEATH; UNRESPONSIVE WAKEFULNESS; MEDIA COVERAGE; UNIT; END; ACTIVATION; ATTITUDES; SUPPORT	Pain, suffering and positive emotions in patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) and minimally conscious states (MCS) pose clinical and ethical challenges. Clinically, we evaluate behavioural responses after painful stimulation and also emotionally-contingent behaviours (e.g., smiling). Using stimuli with emotional valence, neuroimaging and electrophysiology technologies can detect subclinical remnants of preserved capacities for pain which might influence decisions about treatment limitation. To date, no data exist as to how healthcare providers think about end-of-life options (e.g., withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration) in the presence or absence of pain in non-communicative patients. Here, we aimed to better clarify this issue by re-analyzing previously published data on pain perception (Prog Brain Res 2009 177, 329-38) and end-of-life decisions (J Neurol 2010 258, 1058-65) in patients with disorders of consciousness. In a sample of 2259 European healthcare professionals we found that, for VS/UWS more respondents agreed with treatment withdrawal when they considered that VS/UWS patients did not feel pain (77%) as compared to those who thought VS/UWS did feel pain (59%). This interaction was influenced by religiosity and professional background. For MCS, end-of-life attitudes were not influenced by opinions on pain perception. Within a contemporary ethical context we discuss (1) the evolving scientific understandings of pain perception and their relationship to existing clinical and ethical guidelines; (2) the discrepancies of attitudes within (and between) healthcare providers and their consequences for treatment approaches, and (3) the implicit but complex relationship between pain perception and attitudes toward life-sustaining treatments.

Pellegata (2013) Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology39, 256269 Characterization of MENX-associated pituitary tumours Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the pathological features, serum hormone levels and ex vivo cultures of pituitary adenomas that occur in rats affected by MENX syndrome. MENX is multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome caused by a germline mutation in the cell cycle inhibitor p27. Characterization of MENX adenomas is a prerequisite to exploit this animal model for molecular and translational studies of pituitary adenomas. Methods: We investigated MENX pituitary adenomas with immunohistochemistry, double immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), measurement of serum hormone levels and ex vivo cultures. Results: Adenomas in MENX rats belong to the gonadotroph lineage. They start from 4 months of age as multiple neoplastic nodules and progress to become large lesions that efface the gland. Adenomas are composed of chromophobic cells predominantly expressing the glycoprotein alpha-subunit (GSU). They show mitotic activity and high Ki67 labelling. A few neoplastic cells co-express gonadotropins and the transcription factor steroidogenic factor 1, together with growth hormone or prolactin and Pit-1, suggesting that they are not fully committed to one cell lineage. Ex vivo cultures show features similar to the primary tumour. Conclusions: Our results suggest that p27 function is critical to regulate gonadotroph cells growth. The MENX syndrome represents a unique model to elucidate the physiological and molecular mechanisms mediating the pathogenesis of gonadotroph adenomas.

In the present study, using a battery of behavioral tests to assess anxiety and depression-like paradigms, as well as memory function, we evaluated the potential behavioral changes induced in mice devoid of Y-5 receptors. Those paradigms were assessed using the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), forced swim test (FST), social interaction test (SI), object recognition test (ORT) and Morris water maze (MWM) in Y-5 knockout (KO) mice and wild type (WT) animals. In the tests associated to anxiety related behaviors (OF, EPM and SI), no difference for locomotion and time spent in the lateral area of open field were observed between Y-5 KO and WT mice. Similar results were observed for time and number of entries in open arms in EPM. Additionally, in SI test, Y-5 KO mice spent same amount of time and number of entries in the stranger chamber as compared to WT animals. In the FST, as compared to WT mice, Y-5 KO mice had similar immobility time on day 1. No memory dysfunction was observed in the MWM and ORT in Y-5 KO mice, as compared to WT. Altogether these data suggest that under basal conditions Y-5 KO and WT mice display similar mood behaviors and memory functions. However, as compared to WT, Y-5 KO mice display increased grooming and rearing in the OF, lower ratio entries in open arms in the EPM and increased immobility time on the second day of the FST.

In this article, we evaluate the use of a set of sequential tubes that dilate and provide retraction of the overlying brain tissue acting as a surgical corridor for deep-seated brain lesions resection. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive review of the literature of previously described techniques using variable brain tubular retractor systems. We discuss the adaptation of a system designed for spinal use to intracranial pathologies and evaluate the outcomes for the patients involved in the study. Moreover, the advantages and limitations of the described technique were presented. Between August 2005 and 2011, a total of 30 patients with deep brain lesions were operated on using an incremental increase of tubing size for brain retraction guided by a frameless navigation device. Of these, seven cases were intraventricular, and 23 were intraparenchymal. Gross total resection was achieved in 70 % of cases, and the remaining had planned subtotal resections due to involvement of an eloquent area. In conclusion, the technique of serial dilatation of the brain tissue can be used in conjunction with a microscope or endoscope to provide satisfactory access to deep intracranial pathologies. It appears to minimize the associated retraction injury to the surrounding tissue by gradually dilating the white fiber tracts. This operative approach may be considered as an effective and safe alternative for brain tumor resections in selected cases, especially deep-seated lesions.

The impact of poor sleep on daytime cognitive functioning in autism is not well-known and we therefore investigated whether sleep in autism correlates with daytime cognitive performance. A battery of non-verbal tasks was administered, in the morning after a second night of sleep in the laboratory, to 17 young adults with autism and normal intelligence, and 14 typically developed individuals matched for age and IQ; none of the participants complained about sleep problems. Two dimensions of attention (sustained and selective) and 4 types of memory (working, declarative, sensory-motor and cognitive procedural) were tested. Individuals with autism showed clear signs of poor sleep. Their performance differed from the controls in response speed but not in accuracy. Signs of poor sleep in the autism group were significantly correlated with either normal performance (selective attention and declarative memory) or performance inferior to that of the controls (sensory-motor and cognitive procedural memories). Both groups presented a significant negative correlation between slow-wave sleep (SWS) and learning a sensory-motor procedural memory task. Only control participants showed a positive association between SWS duration and number of figures recalled on the declarative memory task. Correlation patterns differed between groups when sleep spindles were considered: they were negatively associated with number of trials needed to learn the sensory-motor procedural memory task in autism and with reaction time and number of errors on selective attention in the controls. Correlation between rapid eye movements (REMs) in REM sleep and cognitive procedural memory was not significant. We conclude that some signs reflecting the presence of poor sleep in adults with high-functioning autism correlate with various aspects of motor output on non-verbal performance tasks. The question is raised whether poor sleep in non-complaining persons with autism should be treated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is usually reflected in an onset-locked larger N1 over the posterior contralateral hemisphere relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere, an early ERP asymmetry labeled N1pc. When the peripheral sudden onset is followed by a central stimulus, or by a bilaterally balanced visual array of stimuli, these events evoke a reversed N1pc, that is, a larger N1 over the hemisphere ipsilateral to the peripheral sudden onset. This N1pc reversal has been taken as evidence for a remapping of the visual space from an absolute, retinally based frame of reference to a relative, attentionally based frame of reference that codes the spatial positions of objects relative to the peripheral sudden onset, rather than relative to the fovea. Here, we pit the reference frame-remapping account against an alternative account based on reduced neural reactivity following the peripheral sudden onset. In three experiments, we varied the spatial location of an object relative to a preceding sudden onset, and tested the opposite predictions generated by the frame-remapping and the reduced neural reactivity accounts. Taken together, the results from the present experiments were consistent with the reduced neural reactivity account and inconsistent with the frame-remapping account.

The Cytosolic Adaptor AP-1A Is Essential for the Trafficking and Function of Niemann-Pick Type C Proteins	TRAFFIC			English	Article						AP-1A; cholesterol; lysosomes; NPC1; NPC2	TRANS-GOLGI NETWORK; MANNOSE 6-PHOSPHATE RECEPTORS; STEROL-SENSING DOMAIN; ESTER STORAGE-DISEASE; VIRUS ENTRY REQUIRES; CHOLESTEROL HOMEOSTASIS; LATE ENDOSOMES; CELLS; NPC1; CLATHRIN	Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by over-accumulation of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/L) throughout the body. Human mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 genes have been directly associated with impaired cholesterol efflux from LE/L. Independent from its role in cholesterol homeostasis and its NPC2 partner, NPC1 was unexpectedly identified as a critical player controlling intracellular entry of filoviruses such as Ebola. In this study, a yeast three-hybrid system revealed that the NPC1 cytoplasmic tail directly interacts with the clathrin adaptor protein AP-1 via its acidic/di-leucine motif. Consequently, a nonfunctional AP-1A cytosolic complex resulted in a typical NPC-like phenotype mainly due to a direct impairment of NPC1 trafficking to LE/L and a partial secretion of NPC2. Furthermore, the mislocalization of NPC1 was not due to cholesterol accumulation in LE/L, as it was not rescued upon treatment with M-cyclodextrin, which almost completely eliminated intracellular free cholesterol. Our cumulative data demonstrate that the cytosolic clathrin adaptor AP-1A is essential for the lysosomal targeting and function of NPC1 and NPC2.

J	Larue, O; Poirier, P; Nkambou, R				Larue, Othalia; Poirier, Pierre; Nkambou, Roger			The emergence of (artificial) emotions from cognitive and neurological processes	BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES			English	Article						Emotion; Situated conceptualization; Neuromodulation; Dual process		We address the BICA Challenge with a multi-agent system implementing Stanovich's Tripartite Framework, which we have augmented with a diffuse control system modeled on biological neuromodulations. The Tripartite Framework shows how adaptive yet reflective behavior can emerge from the interaction of three sets of processes: processes responsible for fast context-sensitive behaviors (an autonomous mind), processes responsible for cognitive control (an algorithmic mind), and processes responsible for deliberative processing and rational behavior (a reflective mind). Working within this augmented Tripartite Framework, we were able to build a fully situated, goal-directed sensorimotor agent that can plan its behavior by reasoning on counterfactual situations. In this paper, we put neuromodulations to work towards giving the system well fleshed out emotions. Without them, the system's emotions are purely semantic and cognitive. They are semantic in that the system's conceptual map contains emotion words that are fully linked to other relevant words, and they are cognitive in that algorithmic-level control can focus goal-directed attention on the emotion words when the task demands it (as in an emotional Stroop task). With neuromodulations, we believe we can integrate the main physiological component of Lindquist's situated conceptualization of emotions, core affect, understood physiologically as dynamical patterns of neuromodulations. Emotions in the resulting system are patterns of message passing activity between agents in which neuromodulations can increase sensitivity on salient emotional aspects of environments and focus attention on those aspects. We study the resulting emotions with the help of an emotional Stroop task in which the semantic and cognitive aspects of emotion are observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This ability is enhanced in young adult musicians and reduced in older adults. Here, we investigated the impact of lifelong musicianship on concurrent sound segregation and perception using scalp-recorded ERPs. Older and younger musicians and nonmusicians were presented with periodic harmonic complexes where the second harmonic could be tuned or mistuned by 1-16% of its original value. The likelihood of perceiving two simultaneous sounds increased with mistuning, and musicians, both older and younger, were more likely to detect and report hearing two sounds when the second harmonic was mistuned at or above 2%. The perception of a mistuned harmonic as a separate sound was paralleled by an object-related negativity that was larger and earlier in younger musicians compared with the other three groups. When listeners made a judgment about the harmonic stimuli, the perception of the mistuned harmonic as a separate sound was paralleled by a positive wave at about 400 msec poststimulus (P400), which was enhanced in both older and younger musicians. These findings suggest attention-dependent processing of a mistuned harmonic is enhanced in older musicians and provides further evidence that age-related decline in hearing abilities are mitigated by musical training.

Here, by employing field potential recordings in rat EC slices during 4AP application, we found that: (i) interictal events have a wide range of duration (0.4-3.3 s) and interval of occurrence (1.4-84 s); (ii) ictal discharges are either preceded by an isolated "slow" interictal discharge (ISID; duration = 1.5 +/- 0.1 s, interval of occurrence = 33.8 +/- 1.8 s) or suddenly initiate from a pattern of frequent polispike interictal discharge (FPID; duration = 0.8 +/- 0.1 s; interval of occurrence = 2.7 +/- 0.2 s); and (iii) ISID-triggered ictal events have longer duration (116 +/- 7.3 s) and interval of occurrence (425.8 +/- 42.3 s) than those initiating suddenly during FPID (58.3 +/- 7.8 s and 202.1 +/- 21.8 s, respectively). Glutamatergic receptor antagonists abolished ictal discharges in all experiments, markedly reduced FPIDs but did not influence ISIDs. We also discovered that high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500 Hz) occur more frequently during ISIDs as compared to FPIDs, and mainly coincide with the onset of ISID-triggered ictal discharges. These findings indicate that interictal events may define ictal onset features resembling those seen in vivo in low-voltage fast activity onset seizures. We propose a similar condition to occur in vivo in temporal lobe epileptic patients and animal models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, little is presently known regarding early spine development in MSNs occurring before the arrival of cortical inputs and in particular about the role of DA and D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) DA receptors. A cell culture model reconstituting early cellular interactions between MSNs, intrinsic cholinergic interneurons and DA neurons was used to study the role of DA in spine formation. After 5 or 10 days in vitro, the presence of DA neurons increased the number of immature spine-like protrusions. In MSN monocultures, chronic activation of D1R or D2R also increased the number of spines and spinophilin expression in MSNs, suggesting a direct role for these receptors. In DA-MSN cocultures, chronic blockade of D1R or D2R reduced the number of dendritic spines. Interestingly, the combined activation or blockade of both D1R and D2R failed to elicit more extensive spine formation, suggesting that both receptors act through a mechanism that is not additive. Finally, we found increased ionotropic glutamate receptor responsiveness and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) frequency in DA-MSN co-cultures, in parallel with a higher number of spines containing PSD-95, suggesting that the newly formed spines present functional post-synaptic machinery preparing the MSNs to receive additional glutamatergic contacts. These results represent a first step in the understanding of how dopamine neurons promote the structural plasticity of MSNs during the development of basal ganglia circuits. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This construct has had a powerful impact in computer vision, where it has been used to compute the shapes of likely completion curves between edge fragments in visual imagery. Motivated by these developments, we extend the algorithm to 3D, using a spherical harmonics basis to achieve a rotation invariant computational solution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing the evolution of the probability density function underlying the model. This provides a principled way to compute 3D completion patterns and to derive connectivity measures for orientation data in 3D, as arises in 3D tracking, motion capture, and medical imaging. We demonstrate the utility of the approach for the particular case of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, where we derive connectivity maps for synthetic data, on a physical phantom and on an in vivo high angular resolution diffusion image of a human brain.

However, the eponymous term "G beta gamma" does not do justice to the fact that 5 G beta and 12 G gamma isoforms have evolved in mammals to serve much broader roles beyond their canonical roles in cellular signaling. We explore the phylogenetic diversity of G beta gamma subunits with a view toward understanding these expanded roles in different cellular organelles. We suggest that the particular content of distinct G beta gamma subunits regulates cellular activity, and that the granularity of individual G beta and G gamma action is only beginning to be understood. Given the therapeutic potential of targeting G beta gamma action, this larger view serves as a prelude to more specific development of drugs aimed at individual isoforms.

J	Toscano-Marquez, B; Dunn, RJ; Krahe, R				Toscano-Marquez, Brenda; Dunn, Robert J.; Krahe, Ruediger			Distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mRNA in the brain of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						weakly electric fish; acetylcholine; electrosensory system; in situ hybridization; neuromodulation	LATERAL-LINE LOBE; CENTRAL POSTERIOR/PREPACEMAKER NUCLEUS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING TECHNIQUES; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; OPTIC TECTUM; GYMNOTIFORM FISH; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; ELECTROSENSORY SYSTEM; TORUS-SEMICIRCULARIS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS	Various neuromodulators have been shown to be involved in shaping the sensory information available to the brain. Acetylcholine (ACh) modulation, through muscarinic receptors, is a particularly widespread mechanism of controlling sensory information transmission. The precise effects of ACh modulation depend on the subtype of muscarinic ACh receptors that are activated. In weakly electric fish, previous work suggested a role of ACh, via muscarinic receptors, in the modulation of information transmission in the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of the hindbrain. In this study, we determined which muscarinic receptor (mAChR) subtypes are present in the brain of Apteronotus leptorhynchus as well as their spatial distribution. We partially cloned three subtypes of muscarinic receptors (mAChR2, 3, and 4) from brain tissue of A. leptorhynchus and used in situ hybridization in transverse sections of the brain to determine their distributions. Sites labeled for the three muscarinic receptor mRNAs were found in various brain regions devoted to the processing of different sensory modalities. The mRNA probes for the three receptor types showed differential distribution but also overlapping presence of two or more receptors in particular nuclei. In addition to the presence of mAChR3 in the ELL region, electrosensory nuclei including the nucleus praeeminentialis, dorsal torus semicircularis and optic tectum showed expression of one or more mAChRs. Thus, the overall pattern of mAChR expression found is in agreement with mAChR expression in other species, with additional presence evident in specialized regions of the electrosensory system, which suggests an important modulating role of ACh in this sensory modality.

Diffusion in gray matter is more isotropic, however, several groups have observed coherent patterns of diffusion anisotropy within the cerebral cortical gray matter. We extend the study of cortical diffusion anisotropy by relating it to the local coordinate system of the folded cerebral cortex. We use 1 mm and sub-millimeter isotropic resolution diffusion imaging to perform a laminar analysis of the principal diffusion orientation, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and partial volume effects. Data from 6 in vivo human subjects, a fixed human brain specimen and an anesthetized macaque were examined. Large regions of cortex show a radial diffusion orientation. In vivo human and macaque data displayed a sharp transition from radial to tangential diffusion orientation at the border between primary motor and somatosensory cortex, and some evidence of tangential diffusion in secondary somatosensory cortex and primary auditory cortex. Ex vivo diffusion imaging in a human tissue sample showed some tangential diffusion orientation in S1 but mostly radial diffusion orientations in both M1 and S1. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We now report results on quality of life and cognitive function and on clinical outcomes at 1 year. METHODS We enrolled 4752 patients with coronary artery disease who were scheduled to undergo CABG and randomly assigned them to undergo the procedure off-pump or on-pump. Patients were enrolled at 79 centers in 19 countries. We assessed quality of life and cognitive function at discharge, at 30 days, and at 1 year and clinical outcomes at 1 year. RESULTS At 1 year, there was no significant difference in the rate of the primary composite outcome between off-pump and on-pump CABG (12.1% and 13.3%, respectively; hazard ratio with off-pump CABG, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.07; P = 0.24). The rate of the primary outcome was also similar in the two groups in the period between 31 days and 1 year (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.13; P = 0.19). The rate of repeat coronary revascularization at 1 year was 1.4% in the off-pump group and 0.8% in the on-pump group (hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.89; P = 0.07). There were no significant differences between the two groups at 1 year in measures of quality of life or neurocognitive function. CONCLUSIONS At 1 year after CABG, there was no significant difference between off-pump and on-pump CABG with respect to the primary composite outcome, the rate of repeat coronary revascularization, quality of life, or neurocognitive function.

Wengen, the Sole Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor in Drosophila, Collaborates with Moesin to Control Photoreceptor Axon Targeting during Development	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL-SYSTEM; PRONEURAL GENES; TNF SUPERFAMILY; NEURITE GROWTH; NOGO RECEPTOR; PROTEIN; EIGER; CELL; FLAMINGO; PATHWAY	Photoreceptor neurons (R cells) in the Drosophila eye define a map of visual space by connecting to targets in distinct layers of the optic lobe, with R1-6 cells connecting to the lamina (the first optic ganglion) and R7 and R8 cells connecting to the medulla (the second optic ganglion). Here, we show that Wengen (Wgn) directly binds Moesin (Moe) through a cytosolic membrane proximal domain and this interaction is important for mediating two distinct aspects of axonal targeting. First, we show that loss of wgn or moe function disrupts cell autonomous R8 axon targeting. Second, we report that wgn or moe mutants show defects in R2-R5 targeting that result from disruption of non-cell autonomous effects, which are secondary to the cell autonomous R8 phenotype. Thus, these studies reveal that the Wgn-Moe signaling cascade plays a key role in photoreceptor target field innervations through cell autonomous and non cell autonomous mechanisms.

Interventions Sildenafil (n=113) or placebo (n=103) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks. Main Outcome Measures Primary end point was change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included change in 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite clinical status score (range, 1-n, a higher value indicates better status; expected value with no treatment effect, 95) based on time to death, time to cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization, and change in quality of life for participants without cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization at 24 weeks. Results Median age was 69 years, and 48% of patients were women. At baseline, median peak oxygen consumption (11.7 mL/kg/min) and 6-minute walk distance (308 m) were reduced. The median E/e' (16), left atrial volume index (44 mL/m(2)), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (41 mm Hg) were consistent with chronically elevated left ventricular filling pressures. At 24 weeks, median (IQR) changes in peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) in patients who received placebo (-0.20 [IQR, -0.70 to 1.00]) or sildenafil (-0.20 [IQR, -1.70 to 1.11]) were not significantly different (P=.90) in analyses in which patients with missing week-24 data were excluded, and in sensitivity analysis based on intention to treat with multiple imputation for missing values (mean between-group difference, 0.01 mL/kg/min, [95% CI, -0.60 to 0.61]). The mean clinical status rank score was not significantly different at 24 weeks between placebo (95.8) and sildenafil (94.2) (P=.85). Changes in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks in patients who received placebo (15.0 m [IQR, -26.0 to 45.0]) or sildenafil (5.0 m [IQR, -37.0 to 55.0]; P=.92) were also not significantly different. Adverse events occurred in 78 placebo patients (76%) and 90 sildenafil patients (80%). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 placebo patients (16%) and 25 sildenafil patients (22%). Conclusion and Relevance Among patients with HFPEF, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with administration of sildenafil for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity or clinical status.

Here, we developed a method to measure presynaptic activity through the biotinylation of vesicular transporters in vesicles fused with presynaptic membranes during neurotransmitter release. This method allowed us for the first time to selectively quantify the spontaneous or evoked release of glutamate or GABA at their respective synapses. Using this method to investigate presynaptic changes during the expression of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1/5)-mediated long-term depression (LTD) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we discovered that this form of LTD was associated with increased presynaptic release of glutamate, despite reduced miniature EPSCs measured with whole-cell recording. Moreover, we found that specific blockade of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) endocytosis with a membrane-permeable GluR2-derived peptide not only prevented the expression of LTD but also eliminated LTD-associated increase in presynaptic release. Thus, our work not only demonstrates that mGluR1/5-mediated LTD is associated with increased endocytosis of postsynaptic AMPARs but also reveals an unexpected homeostatic/compensatory increase in presynaptic release. In addition, this study indicates that biotinylation of vesicular transporters in live cultured neurons is a valuable tool for studying presynaptic function.

Local field potentials reflect multiple spatial scales in V4	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						receptive field; multiunit activity; local field potentials; V4; visual cortex	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; AREA V4; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SPIKING ACTIVITY; AUDITORY-CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; SINGLE NEURONS; FIRING RATE; MACAQUE V1; LFP	Local field potentials (LFP) reflect the properties of neuronal circuits or columns recorded in a volume around a microelectrode (Buzsai et al., 2012). The extent of this integration volume has been a subject of some debate, with estimates ranging from a few hundred microns (Katzner et al., 2009; Xing et al., 2009) to several millimeters (Kreirnan et al., 2006). We estimated receptive fields (RFs) of multi unit activity (MUA) and LFPs at an intermediate level of visual processing, in area V4 of two macaques. The spatial structure of LFP receptive fields varied greatly as a function of time lag following stimulus onset, with the retinotopy of LFPs matching that of MUAs at a restricted set of time lags. A model based analysis of the LFPs allowed us to recover two distinct stimulus triggered components: an MUA-like retinotopic component that originated in a small volume around the microelectrodes (-354.m), and a second component that was shared across the entire V4 region; this second component had tuning properties unrelated to those of the MUAs. Our results suggest that the [FR reflects neural activity across multiple spatial scales, which both complicates its interpretation and offers new opportunities for investigating the large-scale structure of network processing.

Discussion: The current paper proposes a new way to view the management of dyskinesia in an integrated fashion. We suggest that dyskinesia be considered as a factor in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) equation where the signal is the voluntary movement and the noise is PD symptomatology, including dyskinesia. The goal of clinicians should be to ensure a high SNR in order to maintain or enhance the motor repertoire of patients. To understand why such an approach would be beneficial, we first review mechanisms of dyskinesia, as well as their impact on the quality of life of patients and on the health-care system. Theoretical and practical bases for the SNR approach are then discussed. Summary: Clinicians should not only consider the level of motor symptomatology when assessing the efficacy of their treatment strategy, but also breadth of the motor repertoire available to patients.

This work explores the utility of metallic silver sputtering on tissue sections for high resolution imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) of olefins by laser desorption ionization (LDI). For this purpose, sputtered silver coating thickness was optimized on an assorted selection of mouse and rat tissues including brain, kidney, liver, and testis. For mouse brain tissue section, the thickness was adjusted to 23 +/- 2 nm of silver to prevent ion suppression effects associated with a higher cholesterol and lipid content. On all other tissues, a thickness of at 16 +/- 2 nm provided the best desorption/ionization efficiency. Characterization of the species by MS/MS showed a wide variety of olefinic compounds allowing the IMS of different lipid classes including cholesterol, arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and triacylglyceride 52:3. A range of spatial resolutions for IMS were investigated from 150 mu m down to the high resolution cellular range at 5 mu m. The applicability of direct on-tissue silver sputtering to LDI-IMS of cholesterol and other olefinic compounds presents a novel approach to improve the amount of information that can be obtained from tissue sections. This IMS strategy is thus of interest for providing new biological insights on the role of cholesterol and other olefins in physiological pathways or disease.

Dual effects of daily FTY720 on human astrocytes in vitro: relevance for neuroinflammation	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						Astrocytes; FTY720; Neuroinflammation; Sphingosine-1-phosphate	SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE; CORTICAL ASTROCYTES; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; CELL PROLIFERATION; RECEPTOR; SPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATE; CA2+; PHOSPHORYLATION; MECHANISMS; INJURY	Background: FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya (TM)) is a daily oral therapy for multiple sclerosis that readily accesses the central nervous system (CNS). FTY720 is a structural analog to the sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and is a cognate ligand for the S1P G-protein coupled receptors (S1PR). Studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis using mice with conditionally deleted S1P(1)R from astrocytes indicate that one beneficial effect of FTY720 in this model is via downregulating external receptors, which inhibits responses induced by the natural ligand. Another proposed effect of FTY720 on neuroinflammation is its ability to maintain persistent signaling in cells via internalized S1P(1)R resulting in functional responses that include suppressing intracellular calcium release. We used human fetal astrocytes to investigate potential dual inhibitory-and function-inducing effects of daily FTY720 on responses relevant to neuroinflammation. For the inhibitory effects, we used signaling and proliferation induced by the natural ligand S1P. For the function-inducing responses, we measured inhibition of intracellular calcium release stimulated by the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1 beta. Methods: Astrocytes derived from human fetal CNS specimens and maintained in dissociated cultures were exposed to 100 nM of the biologically active form of FTY720 over a dosing regimen that ranged from a single exposure (with or without washout after 1 h) to daily exposures up to 5 days. Responses measured include: phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (pERK1/2) by Western blotting, Ki-67 immunolabeling for cell proliferation, IL-1 beta-induced calcium release by ratiometric fluorescence, and cytokine/chemokine (IL-6, CXCL10) secretions by ELISA. Results: We observed that a single addition of FTY720 inhibited subsequent S1PR ligand-induced pERK1/2 signaling for >24 h. Daily FTY720 treatments (3-5 days) maintained this effect together with a loss of proliferative responses to the natural ligand S1P. Repeated FTY720 dosing concurrently maintained a functional cell response as measured by the inhibition of intracellular calcium release when stimulated by the cytokine IL-1 beta. Recurrent FTY720 treatments did not inhibit serum-or IL-1 beta-induced pERK1/2. The secretions of IL-6 and CXCL10 in response to IL-1 beta were unaffected by FTY720 treatment(s). Conclusion: Our results indicate that daily FTY720 exposures may regulate specific neuroinflammatory responses by desensitizing astrocytes to external S1PR stimuli while sustaining cellular influences that are independent of new surface S1PR activation.

Phase I Study of GRN1005 in Recurrent Malignant Glioma	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; RECEPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN; DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR; DELIVERY VECTOR ANGIOPEP-2; MEDIATED TRANSCYTOSIS; PACLITAXEL; TUMORS; GLIOBLASTOMA; TISSUE; VITRO	Purpose: GRN1005 is a peptide-drug conjugate with the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and tumor cells by targeting the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1. We conducted a first-in-human phase I trial of GRN1005 in patients with recurrent glioma. Methods: Patients received GRN1005 by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Doses were escalated using a modified Fibonacci scheme. Study objectives included safety, tolerability, identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary evidence of efficacy. Tumor extracted from patients undergoing surgery following administration of GRN1005 was analyzed to determine whether therapeutic concentrations of GRN1005 were achieved. Results: Sixty-three patients received GRN1005 at doses of 30 to 700 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Therapy was well tolerated with neutropenia, leucopenia, and fatigue as the most frequent drug-associated grade 3/4 or higher toxicities. The MTD was 650 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 mucositis and grade 4 neutropenia. There was no evidence of central nervous system toxicity or antibody production. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that exposure to GRN1005 was dose proportional. We observed one complete and two partial responses. Eight of 27 patients dosed >= 420 mg/m(2) had stable disease, which lasted a median of 51 days. Therapeutic concentrations of GRN1005 and free paclitaxel were shown in tumor tissue of surgical patients dosed with >= 200 mg/m(2). Conclusion: GRN1005 delivers paclitaxel across the BBB and achieves therapeutic concentrations in tumor tissue. It has similar toxicity to paclitaxel and appears to have activity in recurrent glioma. The recommended phase II dose is 650 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Clin Cancer Res; 19(6); 1567-76. (C)2013 AACR.

CD4 T cells are key players of this inflammatory response. Myelin-specific CD4 T cells expressing CD56, a surrogate marker of NK cells, were shown to be cytotoxic to human oligodendrocytes. Our aim was to identify NK-associated molecules expressed by human CD4 T cells that confer this oligodendrocyte-directed cytotoxicity. We observed that myelin-reactive CD4 T cell lines, as well as short-term PHA-activated CD4 T cells, can express NKG2C, the activating receptor interacting with HLA-E, a nonclassicalMHC class I molecule. These cells coexpress CD56 and NKG2D, have elevated levels of cytotoxic molecules FasL, granzyme B, and perforin compared with their NKG2C-negative counterparts, and mediate significant in vitro cytotoxicity toward human oligodendrocytes, which upregulated HLA-E upon inflammatory cytokine treatment. A significantly elevated proportion of ex vivo peripheral blood CD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells or NK cells, from multiple sclerosis patients express NKG2C compared with controls. In addition, immunohistochemical analyses showed that multiple sclerosis brain tissues display HLA-E+ oligodendrocytes and NKG2C(+) CD4 T cells. Our results implicate a novel mechanism through which infiltrating CD4 T cells contribute to tissue injury in multiple sclerosis. The Journal of Immunology, 2013, 190: 2510-2518.

These neurotoxins display different biochemical activities, but similarly alter the presynaptic membrane permeability causing Ca2+ overload within the nerve terminals, which in turn induces nerve degeneration. Using different methods, here we show that the calcium-activated proteases calpains are involved in the cytoskeletal rearrangements that we have previously documented in neurons exposed to ch-latrotoxin or to snake presynaptic phospholipases A2 neurotoxins. These results indicate that calpains, activated by the massive calcium influx from the extracellular medium, target fundamental components of neuronal cytoskeleton such as spectrin and neurofilaments, whose cleavage is functional to the ensuing nerve terminal fragmentation.

Brain kinin B-1 receptor contributes to the onset of stereotypic nocifensive behavior in rat	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Kinin B-1 receptor; Tachykinin NK1 receptor; Behaviors; Dopamine; Substance P; Glutamate; Nitric oxide	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; SPONTANEOUSLY HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; SUBSTANCE-P ANALOG; B1 RECEPTOR; ANGIOTENSIN-II; SPINAL-CORD; IN-VIVO; BRADYKININ RECEPTORS	While brain kinin B-1 receptor (B1R) is virtually absent in control rats, it contributes to hypertension via a midbrain dopaminergic (DA) mechanism in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension. This study aims at determining whether B1R can also affect stereotypic nocifensive behavior through DA and/or other neuromediators in the same models. The selective B1R agonist Sar[D-Phe(8)][des-Arg(9)]BK was injected i.c.v. (1 mu g/site) to freely behaving SHR (16 weeks), Ang II-hypertensive rats (200 ng/kg/min x 2 weeks, s.c.) and control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Behavioral activity to the agonist was measured before and after treatment with receptor antagonists (10 mu g/site i.c.v. or otherwise stated) for B-1 (SSR240612), tachykinin NK1 (RP67580), glutamate NMDA (DL-AP5), DA D-1 (SCH23390, 0.2 mg/kg s.c.) and D-2 (Raclopride, 0.16 mg/kg s.c.). Other studies included inhibitors (10 mu g/site) of NOS (L-NNA) and iNOS (1400W). The possible desensitisation of B1R upon repeated intracerebral stimulation was also excluded. B1R expression was measured by qRT-PCR in selected areas and by immunohistochemistry in the ventral tegmental area. Results showed that the B1R agonist had no effect in WKY, yet it induced nocifensive behavioral manifestations in both models of hypertension (face washing, sniffing, head scratching, rearing, teeth chattering, grooming, digging, licking, wet-dog shakes). These responses were prevented by all antagonists and inhibitors tested, but 1400W had a less inhibitory effect on most behaviors. Compared with WKY, B1R mRNA levels were markedly enhanced in hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens of SHR and Ang II-treated rats. B1R was detected on DA neuron of the ventral tegmental area in SHR. Data suggest that kinin B1R is upregulated in midbrain DA system in hypertensive rats and its i.c.v. activation induced stereotypic nocifensive behavior that is mediated by several mediators, notably substance P, glutamate, DA and NO.

Such patterns in the brain signals can be associated with coordinated neural oscillations, which can be modeled by non-linear systems. Further, these patterns can be quantified through dynamical non-stationarity based on detection of qualitative changes in the state of the systems underlying the observed brain signals. This study explored age-related changes in dynamical non-stationarity of the brain signals recorded at rest, longitudinally with 128-channel EEG during early adolescence (10 to 13 years of age, 56 participants). Dynamical non-stationarity was analyzed based on segmentation of the time series with subsequent grouping of the segments into clusters with similar dynamics. Age-related changes in dynamical non-stationarity were described in terms of the number of stationary states and the duration of the stationary segments. We found that the EEG signal became more non-stationary with age. Specifically, the number of states increased whereas the mean duration of the stationary segment decreased with age. These two effects had global and parieto-occipital distribution, respectively, with the later effect being most dominant in the alpha (around 10 Hz) frequency band.

Craving is also under the influence of other factors in daily life, such as drug availability and self-control. Neuroimaging studies using drug cue paradigms have shown frontal lobe involvement in this contextual influence on cue reactivity, but have not clarified how and which frontal area accounts for this phenomenon. We explored frontal lobe contributions to cue-induced drug craving under different intertemporal drug availability conditions by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging in smokers. We hypothesized that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regulates craving during changes in intertemporal availability. Subjective craving was greater when cigarettes were immediately available, and this effect was eliminated by transiently inactivating the DLPFC with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the signal most proportional to subjective craving was located in the medial orbitofrontal cortex across all contexts, whereas the DLPFC most strongly encoded intertemporal availability information. The craving-related signal in the medial orbitofrontal cortex was attenuated by inactivation of the DLPFC, particularly when cigarettes were immediately available. Inactivation of the DLPFC also reduced craving-related signals in the anterior cingulate and ventral striatum, areas implicated in transforming value signals into action. These findings indicate that DLPFC builds up value signals based on knowledge of drug availability, and support a model wherein aberrant circuitry linking dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices may underlie addiction.

The PaS receives strong cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain that is likely to modulate neuronal excitability and contribute to theta-frequency network activity. The present study used whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings to determine the effects of cholinergic receptor activation on layer II PaS neurons. Bath application of carbachol (CCh; 10-50 mu M) resulted in a dose-dependent depolarization of morphologically-identified layer II stellate and pyramidal cells that was not prevented by blockade of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Bath application of the M-1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 mu M), but not the M-2-preferring antagonist methoctramine (1 mu M), blocked the depolarization, suggesting that it is dependent on M1 receptors. Voltage-clamp experiments using ramped voltage commands showed that CCh resulted in the gradual development of an inward current that was partially blocked by concurrent application of the selective Kv7.2/3 channel antagonist XE-991, which inhibits the muscarine-dependent K+ current I-M. The remaining inward current also reversed near E-K and was inhibited by the K+ channel blocker Ba2+, suggesting that M-1 receptor activation attenuates both I-M as well as an additional K+ current. The additional K+ current showed rectification at depolarized voltages, similar to K+ conductances mediated by Kir 2.3 channels. The cholinergic depolarization of layer II PaS neurons therefore appears to occur through M-1-mediated effects on I-M as well as an additional K+ conductance.	[Glasgow, Stephen D.; Chapman, C.

Behavioral and Structural Responses to Chronic Cocaine Require a Feedforward Loop Involving Delta FosB and Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II in the Nucleus Accumbens Shell	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; DENDRITIC SPINES; GENE-EXPRESSION; MUTANT MICE; RECEPTOR; CAMKII; BRAIN; INDUCTION; DOPAMINE; REWARD	The transcription factor Delta FosB and the brain-enriched calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII alpha) are induced in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) by chronic exposure to cocaine or other psychostimulant drugs of abuse, in which the two proteins mediate sensitized drug responses. Although Delta FosB and CaMKII alpha both regulate AMPA glutamate receptor expression and function in NAc, dendritic spine formation on NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and locomotor sensitization to cocaine, no direct link between these molecules has to date been explored. Here, we demonstrate that Delta FosB is phosphorylated by CaMKII alpha at the protein-stabilizing Ser27 and that CaMKII is required for the cocaine-mediated accumulation of Delta FosB in rat NAc. Conversely, we show that Delta FosB is both necessary and sufficient for cocaine induction of CaMKII alpha gene expression in vivo, an effect selective for D-1-type MSNs in the NAc shell subregion. Furthermore, induction of dendritic spines on NAc MSNs and increased behavioral responsiveness to cocaine after NAc overexpression of Delta FosB are both CaMKII dependent. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time induction of Delta FosB and CaMKII in the NAc of human cocaine addicts, suggesting possible targets for future therapeutic intervention. These data establish that Delta FosB and CaMKII engage in a cell-type-and brain-region-specific positive feedforward loop as a key mechanism for regulating the reward circuitry of the brain in response to chronic cocaine.

What hinders vascular regrowth in the ischemic central nervous system remains largely unknown. Using the ischemic retina as a model of neurovascular interaction in the CNS, we provide evidence that the failure of reparative angiogenesis is temporally and spatially associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The canonical ER stress pathways of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring enzyme-1 alpha (IRE1 alpha) are activated within hypoxic/ischemic retinal ganglion neurons, initiating a cascade that results in angiostatic signals. Our findings demonstrate that the endoribonuclease IRE1 alpha degrades the classical guidance cue netrin-1. This neuron-derived cue triggers a critical reparative-angiogenic switch in neural macrophage/microglial cells. Degradation of netrin-1, by persistent neuronal ER stress, thereby hinders vascular regeneration. These data identify a neuronal-immune mechanism that directly regulates reparative angiogenesis.

The first topology (zero-deck) contains no hidden layer, the second (one-deck) has a single hidden layer, and for the last topology (two-deck), the task is divided in two subtasks implemented as two stacked neural networks, with explicit word-centred letters as intermediate representations. All topologies successfully simulated two key benchmark phenomena observed in skilled human reading: transposed-letter priming and relative-position priming. However, the two-deck topology most accurately simulated the ability to discriminate words from nonwords, while containing the fewest connection weights. We analysed the internal representations after training. Zero-deck networks implement a letter-based scheme with a position bias to differentiate anagrams. One-deck networks implement a holographic overlap coding in which representations are essentially letter-based and words are linear combinations of letters. Two-deck networks also implement holographic-coding.

J	Maillet, D; Rajah, MN				Maillet, David; Rajah, M. Natasha			Association between prefrontal activity and volume change in prefrontal and medial temporal lobes in aging and dementia: A review	AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Review						Aging; Prefrontal cortex; Dementia; Medial temporal lobe; Structure-function	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EARLY ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; OLDER-ADULTS; EPISODIC MEMORY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; FMRI ACTIVATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY	Functional neuroimaging studies have consistently reported age-related changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during a variety of cognitive tasks, including episodic memory. These changes are often interpreted within the context of one of the following three neural models of age-related changes in brain function: dedifferentiation, neural inefficiency, and neural plasticity and compensation models. Distinguishing between these competing models has proven difficult when interpreting results using functional imaging data alone. In this paper we suggest that a more accurate interpretation of age-related changes in PFC activity requires consideration of age-related differences in gray matter volume (GMv) in PFC and the medial temporal lobes (MU). We review fMRI studies of cognitive aging that have directly examined the relationship between PFC activity and both local (PFC) and distal (MTL) GMv in older versus younger adults. We also considered how structure-function relationships may be further modified in pathological aging (i.e. mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)). We found that when task performance was matched between age-groups there was a negative association between regional PFC volume and activity in older adults. However, when older adults performed worse than young adults we observed a positive association between volume and activity in right lateral PFC. Additionally during memory tasks, several studies revealed that PFC activity is positively related to GM volume in MTL in healthy older adults, but negatively related in MCI and AD patients. We conclude that PFC activity is related to age-related changes in local and distal GM volume reductions and that consideration of these structural measures aids the interpretation of fMRI results. Furthermore, the study of structure-function relationships may provide important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying healthy versus pathological aging.

Recently the PCP pathway was implicated in ciliogenesis and in ciliary function. The primary cilium is an apically projecting solitary organelle that is generated via polarized intracellular trafficking. Because it acts as a signaling nexus, defects in ciliogenesis or cilial function cause multiple congenital anomalies in vertebrates. Loss of the PCP effector Fuzzy affects PCP signaling and formation of primary cilia; however, the mechanisms underlying these processes are largely unknown. Here we report that Fuzzy localizes to the basal body and ciliary axoneme and is essential for ciliogenesis by delivering Rab8 to the basal body and primary cilium. Fuzzy appears to control subcellular localization of the core PCP protein Dishevelled, recruiting it to Rab8-positive vesicles and to the basal body and cilium. We show that loss of Fuzzy results in inhibition of PCP signaling and hyperactivation of the canonical WNT pathway. We propose a mechanism by which Fuzzy participates in ciliogenesis and affects both canonical WNT and PCP signaling.

Australian Canc Study; Australian Ovarian Canc Study; Consortium Investigators Modifiers	Identification and molecular characterization of a new ovarian cancer susceptibility locus at 17q21.31	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MICRORNA EXPRESSION; GENETIC-VARIANTS; FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION; SITE POLYMORPHISMS; PARKINSON-DISEASE; COMMON INVERSION; BINDING-SITES; MAPT REGION; RISK	Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has a heritable component that remains to be fully characterized. Most identified common susceptibility variants lie in non-protein-coding sequences. We hypothesized that variants in the 3' untranslated region at putative microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites represent functional targets that influence EOC susceptibility. Here, we evaluate the association between 767 miRNA-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (miRSNPs) and EOC risk in 18,174 EOC cases and 26,134 controls from 43 studies genotyped through the Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study. We identify several miRSNPs associated with invasive serous EOC risk (odds ratio 1.12, P 10(-8)) mapping to an inversion polymorphism at 17q21.31. Additional genotyping of non-miRSNPs at 17q21.31 reveals stronger signals outside the inversion (P 10(-10)). Variation at 17q21.31 is associated with neurological diseases, and our collaboration is the first to report an association with EOC susceptibility. An integrated molecular analysis in this region provides evidence for ARH-GAP27 and PLEKHM1 as candidate EOC susceptibility genes.

This study examined the extent to which these subsets of MoCA items evaluate their intended cognitive domains. Methods: Clinical data from 185 geriatric memory clinic outpatients who underwent cognitive screening and subsequent neuropsychological assessment were analyzed. Factor analysis of their neuropsychological test scores identified 5 cognitive domains memory, language, visuospatial ability, attention/processing speed, and cognitive control. Scores on MoCA subtests were examined for their correlations with individual factor scores and for their sensitivity and specificity in predicting impairment within each domain. Results: The MoCA subtest scores correlated significantly but modestly with neuropsychological test factor scores in their corresponding domains, for example, the correlation between 5-word recall and the memory factor was 0.46. However, subtest scores were poor predictors of impaired performance on the tests contributing to each cognitive domain. The best predictive accuracy was seen for the visuospatial/executive subtest that showed fair accuracy at predicting impairment on tests in the visuospatial domain. Other subtests showed unacceptably poor levels of accuracy when predicting impaired scores in their respective domains (60%-67%). Conclusions: In a sample of geriatric outpatients referred for cognitive assessment, performance on individual items and subtests of the MoCA yields insufficient information to draw conclusions about impairment in specific cognitive domains as determined by neuropsychological testing.

Methods Clinical and brain magnetic resonance imaging measures of disease activity were monitored serially in patients participating in the Canadian MS HSCT Study. Reconstitution kinetics of immune-cell subsets were determined by flow cytometry, whereas thymic function was assessed using T-cell receptor excision circle analyses as well as flow cytometry measurements of CD31+ recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). Functional assays were performed to track central nervous systemautoreactive antigen-specific T-cell responses, and the relative capacity to generate Th1, Th17, or Th1/17 T-cell responses. Results Complete abrogation of new clinical relapses and new focal inflammatory brain lesions throughout the 2 years of immune monitoring following treatment was associated with sustained decrease in naive T cells, in spite of restoration of both thymic function and release of RTEs during reconstitution. Re-emergence as well as in vivo expansion of autoreactive T cells to multiple myelin targets was evident in all patients studied. The reconstituted myelin-specific T cells exhibited the same Th1 and Th2 responses as preablation myelin-reactive T cells. In contrast, the post-therapy T-cell repertoire exhibited a significantly diminished capacity for Th17 responses. Interpretation Our results indicate that diminished Th17 and Th1/17 responses, rather than Th1 responses, are particularly relevant to the abrogation of new relapsing disease activity observed in this cohort of patients with aggressive MS following chemoablation and HSCT.

Neurobehavioural correlates of body mass index and eating behaviours in adults: A systematic review	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Obesity; Impulsivity; BMI; Neuropsychology; Executive functions; Food motivation; Five-Factor Model; Big Five; Personality; Self-control; Sensitivity to reward; Reliability	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DECISION-MAKING DEFICITS; WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; IOWA GAMBLING TASK; CARD SORTING TEST; FOOD-INTAKE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; SELF-CONTROL	The worldwide increase in obesity has spurred numerous efforts to understand the regulation of eating behaviours and underlying brain mechanisms. These mechanisms can affordably be studied via neurobehavioural measures. Here, we systematically review these efforts, evaluating neurocognitive tests and personality questionnaires based on: (a) consistent relationship with obesity and eating behaviour, and (b) reliability. We also considered the measures' potential to shed light on the brain mechanisms underlying these individual differences. Sixty-six neurocognitive tasks were examined. Less than 11%, mainly measures of executive functions and food motivation, yielded both replicated and reliable effects. Several different personality questionnaires were consistently related to BMI. However, further analysis found that many of these questionnaires relate closely to Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Neuroticism within the Five-Factor Model of personality. Both neurocognitive tests and personality questionnaires suggest that the critical neural systems related to individual differences in obesity are lateral prefrontal structures underpinning self-control and striatal regions implicated in food motivation. This review can guide selection of the highest yield neurobehavioural measures for future studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This non-associative learning rule is modelled at the synaptic level and validated through robotic behaviours in reaction to different stimuli patterns in a dynamical virtual 3D world. Habituation is minimally represented to show an attenuated response after exposure to and perception of persistent external stimuli. Based on current neurosciences research, the originality of this rule includes modulated response to variable frequencies of the captured stimuli. Filtering out repetitive data from the natural habituation mechanism has been demonstrated to be a key factor in the attention phenomenon, and inserting such a rule operating at multiple temporal dimensions of stimuli increases a robot's adaptive behaviours by ignoring broader contextual irrelevant information.

Consequently, there is a critical need for more-effective methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the complications of atherosclerosis. Careful and well-conducted large population studies are needed in order to truly understand the natural history of the disease, its imaging biomarkers, and their links to patient outcomes. The Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN) is a unique research network funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canada Foundation for Innovation and designed to address these needs and to enable large population-based imaging studies. The central objective of CAIN is to move innovations in imaging toward their broad application in clinical research and clinical practice for the improved evaluation of cardiac and neurologic vascular disease. CAIN is established as an international resource for studying the natural history, progression, and regression of atherosclerosis, as well as novel therapeutic interventions aimed at atherosclerosis. The network represents Canada's leading atherosclerosis imaging experts, embodying both basic imaging science and clinical imaging research. The network is improving methods of detection and treatment of atherosclerosis and, through a better understanding of the underlying disease itself, improving strategies for disease prevention. The benefits are expected to appear in the next 2 to 3 years. CAIN will drive innovation in imaging technology within the field of cardiology and neurology and improve health outcomes in Canada and worldwide.

However, some residual sensory processing may still occur and overcome inattention symptoms when contralesional stimuli are perceptually or biologically salient, as shown for emotional faces or voices. These effects have been attributed to enhanced neural responses of sensory regions to emotional stimuli, presumably driven by feedback signals from limbic regions such as the amygdala. However, because emotional faces and voices also differ from neutral stimuli in terms of physical features, the affective nature of these effects still remains to be confirmed. Here we report data from a right parietal patient in whom left visual extinction was reduced for contralesional visual stimuli following pavlovian aversive conditioning, relative to the same stimulus before conditioning, and relative to similar but non-conditioned stimuli. This reduction of. visual extinction was thus mediated by the emotional meaning of stimuli acquired through implicit learning. Functional magnetic resonance imaging also showed that conditioned visual stimuli elicited greater activation in right visual cortex, relative to the non-conditioned stimuli, together with differential activations in amygdala. These results support the hypothesis that emotional appraisal, not only the processing of perceptual features, may partly restore attention to salient information in contralesional space. These findings open new perspectives to improve rehabilitation strategies in neglect, based on affective and motivational signals. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In either instance, it rarely occurs outside the central nervous system. By analysis of a large case series, we sought to further characterize the clinical, radiologic and pathologic features of hemangioblastomas involving nerve root. Materials and methods: The clinical presentations of 6 proximal nerve root hemangioblastomas (1 an aggressive tumor) were analyzed with emphasis on the neuroimaging, operative, and pathologic findings. The literature is fully reviewed and updated. Results: Nerve hemangioblastoma usually affects proximal spinal roots. Peripheral nerve is rarely involved. Both clinically and radiologically, the diagnosis is usually not suspected before surgery. Profuse bleeding at resection may be the first indication of the nature of the lesion. These tumors may arise both sporadically and in association with VHL disease. Conclusion: Given their rarity, nerve root hemangioblastomas are not generally considered in the preoperative differential diagnosis of proximal nerve root lesions. Given their propensity to bleed profusely at surgery and the potential association with VHL disease, knowledge of this entity is important.

High temporal resolution achieved by EEG recordings allows the study of the dynamical properties of synchronous patterns of activity at a very fine temporal scale but with very low spatial resolution. Spatial resolution can be improved by retrieving the neural sources of EEG signal, thus solving the so-called inverse problem. Although many methods have been proposed to solve the inverse problem and localize brain activity, few of them target the synchronous brain regions. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm aimed at localizing specifically synchronous brain regions and reconstructing the time course of their activity. Using multivariate wavelet ridge analysis, we extract signals capturing the synchronous events buried in the EEG and then solve the inverse problem on these signals. Using simulated data, we compare results of source reconstruction accuracy achieved by our method to a standard source reconstruction approach. We show that the proposed method performs better across a wide range of noise levels and source configurations. In addition, we applied our method on real dataset and identified successfully cortical areas involved in the functional network underlying visual face perception. We conclude that the proposed approach allows an accurate localization of synchronous brain regions and a robust estimation of their activity.

This study uses fragmented images with intracranial electroencephalography to investigate the precise spatio-temporal dynamic of iGBR elicited by the recognition of objects presented for the first time and 24 h later. Results show an increased iGBR at recognition in regions involved in bottom:up processes such as the cuneus and the lateral occipital complex. Top-down facilitation involved the lingual gyrus, the precuneus and the superior parietal lobule when images were presented for the first time. Twenty-four hours later, top-down facilitation was mediated by frontal areas involved in retrieval from episodic memory. This study showed that the classically reported iGBR is related to object recognition and that top-down processes vary according to task demand. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They suppress epileptic seizures by acting on a variety of mechanisms and molecular targets involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability. These include inhibitory-GABAergic and excitatory-glutamatergic neurotransmission, as well as ion (sodium and calcium) conductance through voltage-gated channels. On the other hand, accruing evidence indicates that these mechanisms and targets are also implicated in the regulation of mood and behavior, which may explain why each AED is associated with specific psychotropic effects. These effects, however, cannot be explained solely on the basis of the known mode of action of each AED, and other mechanisms or targets are likely to be implicated. In this article, we review positive and negative effects of AEDs on mood and behavior, discuss putative underlying mechanisms, and highlight knowledge gaps which should be addressed in future studies.

Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that systemic administration of the DA D1-like receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, attenuates acute food deprivation (FD) stress-induced reinstatement. The current study was designed to elucidate the brain regions critical to the effect of SCH 23390 on FD stress-induced reinstatement. Rats were trained to press a lever to self-administer heroin (0.1mg/kg/inf) over a period of 10days. Following training, heroin was removed leading to an extinction of lever pressing. Next, rats were tested for reinstatement twice, under extinction conditions: once following 2148h FD; and once under sated conditions. Prior to testing, SCH 23390 was administered into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell (0.0, 0.3, 0.6g/side), NAc core (0.0, 0.3, 0.6g/side), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC; 0.0, 0.2, 2.0g/side), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC; 0.0, 2.0g/side) or basolateral amygdala (BLA; 0.0, 1.0, 2.0g/side). An attenuation of FD-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking was seen in rats injected with SCH 23390 into the NAc shell, dmPFC or BLA, but not into the NAc core or the vmPFC. These findings support the hypothesis that DA transmission through the DA D1-like receptors plays a critical role in stress-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking.

This literature review reports studies about language therapies for these two variants of primary progressive aphasia. More precisely, the review presents the behavioral interventions and the augmentative/alternative communication tools reported in the literature to improve language performances or to compensate for language difficulties. Most of these studies reported that interventions are efficient. However, inconsistent results are found regarding maintenance of improvement and generalization to untreated language abilities. Other studies are still required to establish the clinical relevance of interventions for language and communication disorders in primary progressive aphasia. In these studies, the use of more ecological interventions focusing on the specific needs of people living with this disease should be specifically addressed.

Reproductive experience modifies the effects of estradiol on learning and memory bias in female rats	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Estrogen; Parity; Multiple memory systems; Learning; T-maze	ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; OVARIECTOMIZED RATS; CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; ESTROUS-CYCLE; HIPPOCAMPUS; EXPRESSION; DORSAL; PLACE; 17-BETA-ESTRADIOL	Previous studies have shown that estrogen affects whether a hippocampus-mediated place (allocentric) or a striatum-mediated response (egocentric) memory system is employed by female rats when searching for a food reward in a maze. Because it has been suggested that reproductive experience alters some of the responses to E in the brain, two experiments were carried out to investigate whether reproductive experience would also alter the effect of E on place and response learning. In experiment 1, 152 ovariectomized nulliparous (n = 77; no reproductive experience) and primiparous (n = 74; having had and raised one litter of pups) Wistar rats were trained on an ambiguous t-maze task and tested for memory system bias. In experiment 2, 35 ovariectomized nulliparous (n = 16) and primiparous (n = 19) Wistar rats were trained on place and response plus-maze tasks. All rats were exposed to no, chronic low or chronic low with pulsatile high 17 beta-estradiol (E2) replacement. Congruent with previous findings, low E2 nulliparous rats showed predominant use of response memory and faster response learning, whereas high E2 nulliparous rats showed a trend towards predominant place memory use. Interestingly, the facilitatory effect of low E2 on response task learning and memory seen in nulliparous rats was not observed in low E2 primiparous rats in either experiment. In conclusion, E2 levels do dictate the rate at which female rats learn a response task and utilize response memory, but only in those with no reproductive experience. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Diet-induced obesity promotes depressive-like behaviour that is associated with neural adaptations in brain reward circuitry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY			English	Article						high-fat food; depression; anxiety; striatum; BDNF; CREB	ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; HIGH-FAT DIET; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DELTA-FOSB; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS; DOPAMINE PATHWAY; PALATABLE FOOD; CREB	BACKGROUND: The biological mechanisms that link the development of depression to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes remain obscure. Dopamine-and plasticity-related signalling in mesolimbic reward circuitry is implicated in the pathophysiology and aetiology of depression. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a palatable high-fat diet (HFD) on depressive-like behaviour and biochemical alterations in brain reward circuitry in order to understand the neural processes that may contribute to the development of depression in the context of diet-induced obesity (DIO). METHODS: Adult male C57Bl6 mice were placed on a HFD or ingredient-matched, low-fat diet for 12 weeks. At the end of the diet regimen, we assessed anxiety and depressive-like behaviour, corticosterone levels and biochemical changes in the midbrain and limbic brain regions. Nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and ventral tegmental area dissections were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against D1A receptor, D2 receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phospho-DARPP-32(thr75), phospho-CREB and Delta FosB. RESULTS: HFD mice showed significant decreases in open arm time and centre time activity in elevated plus maze and open field tasks, respectively, and increased immobility (behavioural despair) in the forced swim test. Corticosterone levels following acute restraint stress were substantially elevated in HFD mice. HFD mice had significantly higher D2R, BDNF and Delta FosB, but reduced D1R, protein expression in the NAc. Notably, the expression of BDNF in both the NAc and DLS and phospho-CREB in the DLS was positively correlated with behavioural despair. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that chronic consumption of high-fat food and obesity induce plasticity-related changes in reward circuitry that are associated with a depressive-like phenotype. As increases in striatal BDNF and CREB activity are well implicated in depressive behaviour and reward, we suggest these signalling molecules may mediate the effects of high-fat feeding and DIO to promote negative emotional states and depressive-like symptomology.

Challenges include a small patient population, the lack of prior randomized clinical trials, and ethical concerns. The goal of this meeting was to assess areas of consensus regarding clinical trial design and outcome measures among academic experts involved in pediatric MS care and research. Methods: The Steering Committee of the International Pediatric MS Study Group identified key focus areas for discussion. A total of 69 meeting attendees were assembled, including 35 academic experts. Regulatory and pharmaceutical representatives also attended, and provided input, which informed academic expert consensus decisions. Results: The academic experts agreed that clinical trials were necessary in pediatric MS to obtain pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy data, and regulatory approval allowing for greater medication access. The academic experts agreed that relapse was an appropriate primary outcome measure for phase III pediatric trials. An international standardized cognitive battery was identified. The pros and cons of various trial designs were discussed. Guidelines surrounding MRI studies, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and registries were developed. The academic experts agreed that given the limited subject pool, a stepwise approach to the launch of clinical trials for the most promising medications is necessary in order to ensure study completion. Alternative approaches could result in unethical exposure of patients to trial conditions without gaining knowledge. Conclusion: Consensus points for conduct of clinical trials in the rare disease pediatric MS were identified amongst a panel of academic experts, informed by regulatory and industry stakeholders.

This study examined the extent, pattern, and correlates of change in cognitive functioning in youth with MS. Method: Changes in cognitive performance in 28 patients with pediatric-onset MS and 26 age-matched controls were ascertained through repeat comprehensive neuropsychological assessment conducted over a 1-year period. Change was evaluated by using a mixed factorial design with repeated measures to determine the interaction between group and time and using the Reliable Change Index (RCI) to determine individual differences on test scores over time. Participants were classified as showing "decline" or "improvement" if change scores exceeded the RCI on three or more tests. Results: The pattern of change over time differed by group. At the group level, healthy controls were more likely to show improvement across multiple domains of function relative to the MS group. Using the RCI, 7 of 28 patients (25%) showed cognitive deterioration compared with only 1 of 26 controls (3.8%; p < .05). Performance on measures of attention and processing speed, visuomotor integration, verbal fluency, visual memory, and calculation and spelling ability were most responsive to deterioration in functioning over time. Longer disease duration was associated with greater deterioration in visuomotor integration. Increased lesion volume was associated with slower psychomotor speed over time. Conclusion: Lower rates of improvement in the pediatric MS group may be suggestive of a lack of age-appropriate cognitive development and warrant further evaluation over time.

The mechanism by which this occurs is unknown, but it likely involves changes in social information processing. In a randomized placebo-controlled study, we examined the influence of intranasal oxytocin and placebo on the interference control component of inhibition (i.e. ability to ignore task-irrelevant information) in 102 participants using a negative affective priming task with sad, angry, and happy faces. In this task, participants are instructed to respond to a facial expression of emotion while simultaneously ignoring another emotional face. On the subsequent trial, the previously-ignored emotional valence may become the emotional valence of the target face. Inhibition is operationalized as the differential delay between responding to a previously-ignored emotional valence and responding to an emotional valence unrelated to the previous one. Although no main effect of drug administration on inhibition was observed, a drug x depressive symptom interaction (beta = -0.25; t = -2.6, p < 0.05) predicted the inhibition of sad faces. Relative to placebo, participants with high depression scores who were administered oxytocin were unable to inhibit the processing of sad faces. There was no relationship between drug administration and inhibition among those with low depression scores. These findings are consistent with increasing evidence that oxytocin alters social information processing in ways that have both positive and negative social outcomes. Because elevated depression scores are associated with an increased risk for major depressive disorder, difficulties inhibiting mood-congruent stimuli following oxytocin administration may be associated with risk for depression.

However, no research to date has documented the dose response relation between intranasal oxytocin administration and cortisot, and researchers examining intranasal oxytocin have not examined the cortisol response to physical stress. We therefore examined the effects of 24IU and 48IU of intranasal oxytocin on the cortisol response to vigorous exercise. Method: Seventeen males participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and within-subject experiment. Participants engaged in vigorous exercise for 60 min following the administration of placebo or intranasal oxytocin on three occasions. Saliva samples and mood ratings were collected at eight intervals across each session. Results: Salivary cortisol concentrations changed over time, peaking after 60 min of exercise (quadratic: F(1,16) = 7.349, p = .015, partial eta(2) = .32). The 24IU dose of oxytocin attenuated cortisol levels relative to placebo (F(1,16) = 4.496, p = .05, partiale eta(2) = .22) and the 48IU dose, although the latter fell just short of statistical significance (F(1,16) = 3.054, p = .10, partial eta(2) = .16). There was no difference in the cortisol response to exercise in participants who were administered 48IU of intranasal oxytocin relative to placebo. Intranasal oxytocin had no effect on mood. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that the effect of intranasal oxytocin on salivary cortisol is dose-dependent, and that intranasal oxytocin attenuates cortisol levels in response to physical stress. Future research using exogenous oxytocin will need to consider the possibility of dose-response relations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of Varicella Zoster Virus Infection Morbidity and Mortality in Pancreas and Kidney-Pancreas Transplant Recipients	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article							RENAL-ALLOGRAFT RECIPIENTS; HERPES-ZOSTER; LUNG TRANSPLANTATION; RISK-FACTORS; COMPLICATIONS; EXPERIENCE; SKIN	Background: Solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of infection due to chronic immunosuppression. The incidence of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection is known to be increased in these patients compared with the immunocompetent population. Previous reports suggested that these patients are likely to experience a morbid disease course. Few data currently exist on the course of VZV infections in pancreas or pancreas plus kidney (PK) transplant recipients. Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the incidence and severity of VZV infections in pancreas or PK recipients. Study Design: We analyzed the transplantation patient database of the Royal Victoria Hospital, identifying 137 pancreas or PK transplantation procedures performed between January 1999 and October 2010, among which we included 98 patients in the study. We subsequently performed a retrospective chart review to evaluate the incidence and severity of VZV infections posttransplantation. Results: Our analysis revealed that 11/98 patients developed VZV infections. The majority of infections (similar to 90.9%) occurred within the first 5 years. Most patients (63.6%) were treated on an outpatient basis, whereas only 4 (36.4%) were hospitalized with a mean hospital stay of 9.5 +/- 8.42 days. The initial immunosuppressive regimen remained unchanged for the majority of patients. All patients experienced a mild disease course without intensive care unit admission or death. Only 3 patients (27.3%) developed postherpetic neuralgia. Conclusion: These findings suggest that with timely diagnosis and proper treatment, most patients recover well from a VZV infection.

In contrast to this view, recent advances in understanding the neurobiology of long-term memory maintenance lead us to propose that a brain-wide well-regulated decay process, occurring mostly during sleep, systematically removes selected memories. Down-regulation of this decay process can increase the life expectancy of a memory and may eventually prevent its loss. Memory interference usually occurs during certain active processing phases, such as encoding and retrieval, and will be stronger in brain areas with minimal sensory integration and less pattern separation. In areas with efficient pattern separation, such as the hippocampus, interference-driven forgetting will be minimal, and, consequently, decay will cause most forgetting.

As coated SPIONs have potential use in the diagnosis and treatment of various brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, a comprehensive understanding of their interactions with A beta and other amyloidogenic proteins is essential prior to their clinical application. Here we demonstrate the effect of thickness and surface charge of the coating layer of SPIONs on the kinetics of fibrillation of A beta in aqueous solution. A size and surface area dependent "dual" effect on A beta fibrillation was observed. While lower concentrations of SPIONs inhibited fibrillation, higher concentrations increased the rate of A beta fibrillation. With respect to coating charge, it is evident that the positively charged SPIONs are capable of promoting fibrillation at significantly lower particle concentrations compared with negatively charged or uncharged SPIONs. This suggests that in addition to the presence of particles, which affect the concentration of monomeric protein in solution (and thereby the nucleation time), there are also effects of binding on the protein conformation.

Processing Noncanonical Sentences in Broca's Region: Reflections of Movement Distance and Type	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						fMRI; language; movement; scrambling; syntax	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; TRACE POSITIONS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CORTEX; BRAIN; AREA; REALITY	Various noncanonical sentence constructions are derived from basic sentence structures by a phrase displacement called Movement. The moved phrase (filler) leaves a silent copy at the extracted position (gap) and is reactivated when the hearer/reader passes over the gap. Consequently, memory operations are assumed to occur to establish the filler-gap link. For languages that have a relatively free word order like German, a distinct linguistic operation called Scrambling is proposed. Although Movement and Scrambling are assumed to be different linguistic operations, they both involve memory prone filler-gap processes. To clarify whether filler-gap memory processes in Scrambling and Movement differ neuroanatomically, we designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study and compared the effect of memory load parameterized by filler-gap distance in the 2 sentence types. Here, we show that processing of the 2 sentence types commonly relies on a left hemispheric network consisting of the inferior frontal gyrus, middle part of the middle temporal gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus. However, we found differences for the 2 sentence types in the linearity of filler-gap distance effect. Thus, the present results suggest that the same neural substrate supports the memory processes of sentences constructed by Movement and Scrambling, although differentially modulated by memory load.

The purpose of the present study is to determine if layer V pyramidal neurons from visual and nonvisual sensory cortical areas that project onto the visual cortex (V1) constitute a homogeneous population of cells. Additionally, we ask whether dendritic arborization relates to the target, the sensory modality, the hierarchical level, or laterality of the source cortical area. Complete 3D reconstructions of dendritic arbors of retrogradely labeled layer V pyramidal neurons were performed for neurons of the primary auditory (A1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices and from the lateral (V2L) and medial (V2M) parts of the secondary visual cortices of both hemispheres. The morphological parameters extracted from these reconstructions were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. The PCA showed that neurons are distributed within a continuous range of morphologies and do not form discrete groups. Nevertheless, the cluster analysis defines neuronal groups that share similar features. Each cortical area includes neurons belonging to several clusters. We suggest that layer V feedback connections within a single cortical area comprise several cell types.	[Laramee, M.

Ecologically driven divergence has been invoked to explain the repeated evolution of sympatric dwarf and normal lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) species in multiple lakes in eastern North America. Nevertheless, links between most putatively adaptive traits and ecological variation remain poorly defined within and among whitefish species pairs. Here, we examine four species pairs for variation in gill, heart, and brain size; three traits predicted to show strong phenotypic responses to ecological divergence. In each of the species pairs, normals exhibited larger body size standardized gills compared to dwarfs a pattern that is suggestive of a common ecological driver of gill size divergence. Within lakes, the seasonal hypoxia experienced in the benthic environment is a likely factor leading to the requirement for larger gills in normals. Interestingly, the morphological pathways used to achieve larger gills varied between species pairs from Quebec and Maine, which may imply subtle non-parallelism in gill size divergence related to differences in genetic background. There was also a non-significant trend toward larger hearts in dwarfs, the more active species of the two, whereas brain size varied exclusively among the lake populations. Taken together, our results suggest that the diversification of whitefish has been driven by parallel and non-parallel ecological conditions across lakes. Furthermore, the phenotypic response to ecological variation may depend on genetic background of each population.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine resting-state default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity in patients with treatment-resistant IGE. Methods Treatment resistance was defined as continuing seizures despite an adequate dose of valproic acid (valproate, VPA). Data from 60 epilepsy patients and 38 healthy controls who underwent simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were included (EEG/fMRI). Independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression were used to quantify DMN connectivity. Confirmatory analysis using seed-based voxel correlation was performed. Key Findings There was a significant reduction of DMN connectivity in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy when compared to patients who were treatment responsive and healthy controls. Connectivity was negatively correlated with duration of epilepsy. Significance Our findings in this large sample of patients with IGE indicate the presence of reduced DMN connectivity in IGE and show that connectivity is further reduced in treatment-resistant epilepsy. DMN connectivity may be useful as a biomarker for treatment resistance.

The aim of this study was to compare patients with VPA-refractory and VPA-responsive IGE in order to determine whether there are group differences in generalized spike and wave discharge (GSWD) generators that may be associated with VPA resistance. Methods Of 89 IGE patients who underwent electroencephalography (EEG) combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; EEG/fMRI), 25 with GSWDs identified in EEG/fMRI data were included. Simultaneous acquisition of 64 channels of EEG data at 10kHz was performed using an MRI-compatible EEG cap and amplifier at 4T. VPA resistance was defined as lack of seizure control despite therapeutic dose of VPA. Key Findings The fMRI blood oxygenlevel dependent (BOLD) correlates of GSWD in the entire group involved midline thalamus, frontal regions comprising Brodmann areas 6, 24, and 32, and temporal lobes diffusely. When VPA-responsive and VPA-resistant patients were compared, BOLD signal increases were noted in the VPA-resistant patients in medial frontal cortex, along the paracingulate gyrus (Montreal Neurological Institute; MNI x=2, y=13.6, z=45.9), and anterior insula bilaterally (right MNI x=37.6, y=7.8, z=0.6, left MNI x=35.3, y=13.6, z=5.3). Significance Our findings support the hypothesis that VPA-resistant and VPA-responsive patients may have different GSWD generators. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these differences in GSWD generators may be the reason for different responses to VPA.

A comprehensive search was undertaken to review all publications on animal models for the study of scoliosis within the database from 1946 to January 2011. The animal models have been grouped under specific headings reflecting the underlying pathophysiology behind the development of the spinal deformities produced in the animals: genetics, neuroendocrine, neuromuscular, external constraints, internal constraints with or without tissue injury, vertebral growth modulation and iatrogenic congenital malformations, in an attempt to organize and classify these multiple scoliotic animal models. As it stands, there are no animal models that mimic the human spinal anatomy with all its constraints and weaknesses, which puts it at risk of developing scoliosis. What we do have are a multitude of models, which produce spinal deformities that come close to the idiopathic scoliosis deformity. All these different animal models compel us to believe that the clinical phenotype of what we call idiopathic scoliosis may well be caused by a variety of different underlying pathologies.

The existing gear prognosis methods are primarily either model-based or data-driven. In this paper, an integrated prognostics method is developed for gear remaining life prediction, which utilizes both gear physical models and real-time condition monitoring data. The general prognosis framework for gears is proposed. The developed physical models include a gear finite element model for gear stress analysis, a gear dynamics model for dynamic load calculation, and a damage propagation model described using Paris' law. A gear mesh stiffness computation method is developed based on the gear system potential energy, which results in more realistic curved crack propagation paths. Material uncertainty and model uncertainty are considered to account for the differences among different specific units that affect the damage propagation path. A Bayesian method is used to fuse the collected condition monitoring data to update the distributions of the uncertainty factors for the current specific unit being monitored, and to achieve the updated remaining useful life prediction. An example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We assessed the relationship between surgical timing and the occurrence of nonneurologic postoperative complications during acute hospital stay for patients with a traumatic SCI. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in a single institution. Four hundred thirty-one cases of traumatic SCI were reviewed, and postoperative complications were recorded from the medical charts. Patients were compared using two different surgical timing cutoffs (24 hours and 72 hours). Logistic regression analyses were modeled for complication occurrence. The effect of surgical timing on complication rate was adjusted for potential confounding variables such as the level of injury, American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade, Injury Severity Score (ISS), age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and Surgical Invasiveness Index. RESULTS: Patients operated on earlier were younger, had less comorbidity, had a higher ISS, and were more likely to have a cervical lesion and a complete injury (ASIA A). A reduction in the global rate of complications as well as in the rate of pneumonias and pressure ulcers were predicted by surgery performed earlier than 72 hours and 24 hours. Increasing age, more severe ASIA grade, and cervical lesion as well as increased Charlson Comorbidity Index, ISS, and SII were also statistically related to the occurrence of complications. CONCLUSION: This study showed that a shorter surgical delay after a traumatic SCI decreases the rate of complications during the acute phase hospitalization. We suggest that patients with traumatic SCI should be promptly operated on earlier than 24 hours following the injury to reduce complications while optimizing neurologic recovery. If medical or practical reasons preclude timing less than 24 hours, efforts should still be made to perform surgery earlier than 72 hours following the SCI.

Accelerated PET water activation acquisition with signal separation methodology	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						PET; activation; acceleration; rrCBF	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; PARAMETRIC IMAGES; ERROR ANALYSIS; RECONSTRUCTION; STIMULATION; TRACERS; MODELS; VOLUME	Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) water activation studies can be considerably accelerated when the time between the successive water bolus injections is reduced. However, when considering shorter interinjection times, as short as 5 min, there will be a contaminating residual PET signal in brain tissues attributed to the previous injections. In this paper a signal separation methodology is proposed to allow shorter (<10 min) interinjection times. Methods: The contaminating signal in the frames of interest is estimated by extrapolating the decaying tail of the previous signal. The method requires the dynamic PET recording of the decaying signals between two injections in order to extrapolate the tail, which can be done post-reconstruction using a weighted least squares method. Several extrapolation functions are investigated, including a quadratic function, a decaying exponential, and a biologically inspired function. The biologically inspired function is based on the one-tissue compartmental model for [O-15]H2O and makes use of a generating function estimated from the total trues coincidence rate. To evaluate the proposed method and extrapolation functions, one- and two-dimensional simulation studies were performed, using interinjection times as low as 5 min. The resulting corrected images are compared to the conventionally obtained images with an interinjection time of 10 min, which allows the previous signal to almost completely vanish. Results: Among all considered extrapolation functions the biologically inspired function was found to give the best results. The bias introduced when considering shorter interinjection times (<10 min) could be almost completely removed by subtracting the extrapolated remaining activity from the total measured signal of interest. Compared to the standard method of using longer interinjection times the resulting images have a slightly increased variance. Nonetheless the observed increases are small compared to the total variance and the resulting activation maps were visually very similar. Conclusions: The simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the total scan time (e.g., when considering 12 bolus injections, the total scan time can be reduced from 2 to 1 h). Extensive and very realistic simulations were used in this work, paving the way for future in vivo validation of the method. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The present study examined the associations between basal levels of cortisol collected over seven consecutive days, the hippocampal volumes and brain activation to thermal stimulations administered in 16 patients with chronic back pain and 18 healthy control subjects. Results showed that patients with chronic back pain have higher levels of cortisol than control subjects. In these patients, higher cortisol was associated with smaller hippocampal volume and stronger pain-evoked activity in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus, a region involved in anticipatory anxiety and associative learning. Importantly, path modelling-a statistical approach used to examine the empirical validity of propositions grounded on previous literature-revealed that the cortisol levels and phasic pain responses in the parahippocampal gyrus mediated a negative association between the hippocampal volume and the chronic pain intensity. These findings support a stress model of chronic pain suggesting that the sustained endocrine stress response observed in individuals with a smaller hippocampii induces changes in the function of the hippocampal complex that may contribute to the persistent pain states.

MEDNIK syndrome was first reported in a few French-Canadian families sharing common ancestors, presenting a complex neurocutaneous phenotype, but its pathogenesis is not completely understood. A Sephardic-Jewish patient, carrying a new AP1S1 homozygous mutation, showed severe perturbations of copper metabolism with hypocupremia, hypoceruloplasminemia and liver copper accumulation, along with intrahepatic cholestasis. Zinc acetate treatment strikingly improved clinical conditions, as well as liver copper and bile-acid overload. We evaluated copper-related metabolites and liver function retrospectively in the original French-Canadian patient series. Intracellular copper metabolism and subcellular localization and function of copper pump ATP7A were investigated in patient fibroblasts. Copper metabolism perturbation and hepatopathy were confirmed in all patients. Studies in mutant fibroblasts showed abnormal copper incorporation and retention, reduced expression of copper-dependent enzymes cytochrome-c-oxidase and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and aberrant intracellular trafficking of Menkes protein ATP7A, which normalized after rescue experiments expressing wild-type AP1S1 gene. We solved the pathogenetic mechanism of MEDNIK syndrome, demonstrating that AP1S1 regulates intracellular copper machinery mediated by copper-pump proteins. This multisystem disease is characterized by a unique picture, combining clinical and biochemical signs of both Menkes and Wilson's diseases, in which liver copper overload is treatable by zinc acetate therapy, and can now be listed as a copper metabolism defect in humans. Our results may also contribute to understand the mechanism(s) of intracellular trafficking of copper pumps.

In May 2012, a search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINEA (R) for prospective trials with 20 patients or more where a cerebral monitoring system was compared with clinical brain monitoring during a carotid endarterectomy performed under regional anesthesia. The quality of the study was evaluated with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Data were extracted independently by the two investigators. Data could be extracted for 4,664 measurements taken from 29 studies: transcranial Doppler (TCD) = 739; cerebral saturation = 320; stump pressure = 2,549; electroencephalography (EEG) = 742; evoked potentials = 187; jugular venous saturation = 79; and jugular venous lactate = 48. The pooled diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained for EEG, TCD, stump pressure, evoked potentials, and cerebral saturation: (DOR 65.3; 95% CI 20.5 to 207.7; I-2 [56.8%]); (DOR 58.1; 95% CI 23.0 to 146.3; I-2 [24.9%]); (DOR 27.8; 95% CI 13.4 to 57.9; I-2 [59.9]); (DOR 17.2; 95% CI 2.4 to 123.9 I-2 [69.1]); and (DOR 12.1; 95% CI 3.5 to 41.2; I-2 [30.8]), respectively. Sequential testing with stump pressure 25 mmHg followed by either TCD or EEG delivered the best post-test probabilities. For EEG, the DOR increases with the number of channels used (P = 0.03). A combination of stump pressure and either TCD or EEG appears to deliver the best results for detecting brain ischemia during carotid artery cross-clamping.

Fatty acids in Great Lakes lake trout and whitefish	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Fish; Omega-3 fatty acids; Lake trout; Whitefish; Great Lakes; PCBs	POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS; NATIVE-AMERICAN POPULATION; SPORT-CAUGHT FISH; FRESH-WATER FISH; FOOD-WEB; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; CONCEPTION DELAY; SUPERIOR FISH; ONTARIO FISH; CONSUMPTION	Fish are an excellent source of lean protein and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) but there is inadequate information on the levels of PUFAs in freshwater fish and specifically Great Lakes fish. Knowledge of PUFAs is necessary to make informed decisions regarding the balance between the benefits of fish consumption due to these factors versus risks of adverse health effects associated with elevated levels of contaminants known to be present in some Great Lakes fish and linked to increased risk of cancer and adverse neurological effects to both infants and adults. Our goal was to determine the lipid profiles in two species of Great Lakes fish, lake trout and whitefish. Total fat and the percentage of total and omega-3 PUFAs were with one exception significantly higher in lake trout than whitefish. Average concentrations of EPA + DHA were 11.2 and 9.7 g/100 g lipid in lake trout and whitefish, respectively. The concentrations of EPA + DHA in fatty marine fish (22.7, 23.9 and 30.2 g/100 g lipid, respectively) are about double those found in Great Lakes lake trout and whitefish. Nevertheless a 100 g serving of Great Lakes lake trout provides more than 500 mg of EPA + DHA, which is the daily intake level recommended by the American Dietetics Association for the prevention of coronary heart disease.

Relationship between transcranial magnetic stimulation measures of intracortical inhibition and spectroscopy measures of GABA and glutamate + glutamine. J Neurophysiol 109: 1343-1349, 2013. First published December 5, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00704.2012.-Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can provide an index of intracortical excitability/inhibition balance. However, the neurochemical substrate of these measures remains unclear. Pharmacological studies suggest the involvement of GABA A and GABA B receptors in TMS protocols aimed at measuring intracortical inhibition, but this link remains inferential. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) permits measurement of GABA and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) concentrations in the human brain and might help in the direct empirical assessment of the relationship between TMS inhibitory measures and neurotransmitter concentrations. In the present study, MRS-derived relative concentrations of GABA and Glx measured in the left M1 of healthy participants were correlated with TMS measures of intracortical inhibition. Glx levels were found to correlate positively with TMS-induced silent period duration, whereas no correlation was found between GABA concentration and TMS measures. The present data demonstrate that specific TMS measures of intracortical inhibition are linked to shifts in cortical Glx, rather than GABA neurotransmitter levels. Glutamate might specifically interact with GABA B receptors, where higher MRS-derived Glx concentrations seem to be linked to higher levels of receptor activity.

Physical determinants of the shape of the psychophysical curve relating tactile roughness to raiseddot spacing: implications for neuronal coding of roughness. J Neurophysiol 109: 1403-1415, 2013. First published December 5, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00717.2012.-There are conflicting reports as to whether the shape of the psychometric relation between perceived roughness and tactile element spacing [spatial period (SP)] follows an inverted U-shape or a monotonic linear increase. This is a critical issue because the former result has been used to assess neuronal codes for roughness. We tested the hypothesis that the relation's shape is critically dependent on tactile element height (raised dots). Subjects rated the roughness of low (0.36 mm)- and high (1.8 mm)-raised-dot surfaces displaced under their fingertip. Inverted U-shaped curves were obtained as the SP of low-dot surfaces was increased (1.3-6.2 mm, tetragonal arrays); a monotonic increase was observed for high-dot surfaces. We hypothesized that roughness is not a single sensory continuum across the tested SPs of low-dot surfaces, predicting that roughness discrimination would show deviations from the invariant relation between threshold (Delta S) and the value of the standard (S) surface (Weber fraction, Delta S/S) expected for a single continuum. The results showed that Weber fractions were increased for SPs on the descending limb of the inverted U-shaped curve. There was also an increase in the Weber fraction for high-dot surfaces but only at the peak (3 mm), corresponding to the SP at which the slope of the psychometric function showed a modest decline. Together the results indicate that tactile roughness is not a continuum across low-dot SPs of 1.3-6.2 mm. These findings suggest that correlating the inverted U-shaped function with neuronal codes is of questionable validity. A simple intensive code may well contribute to tactile roughness.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the expression of proteins involved in neuroplasticity is altered in the amygdala of individuals with depression. Methods: Basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central amygdala (CeA) postmortem human brain samples were collected from individuals with a history of depression (n = 22 and 25, respectively) and psychiatrically healthy controls (CTRL; n = 14). Proteins associated with neuroplasticity were quantified using Western blotting. Results: Immunoblots revealed that depressed subjects displayed increased expression of DCX (p = 0.033) and PSA-NCAM (p = 0.027) in the BLA as compared to CTRLs. Subsequent analyses revealed that this effect was due primarily to a subset of depressed subjects who had not died by suicide (DNS). DNS subjects displayed higher DCX than CTRLs (p < 0.001) and depressed suicides (p = 0.001), and higher PSA-NCAM than CTRLs (p = 0.007). Conversely, within the CeA, DNS subjects displayed a tendency toward lower DCX expression than CTRLs (p = 0.062), and higher BDNF levels than DS subjects (p = 0.045). Conclusion: These results suggest that the BLA and CeA display contrasting patterns of neuroplasticity in depression, and that greater impairment of amygdalar neuroplasticity may be associated with increased risk of suicide.

Automatic seizure detection in SEEG using high frequency activities in wavelet domain	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						Epilepsy; EEG; Automatic seizure detection; Wavelet; High frequency; EMG removal	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; OSCILLATIONS 80-500 HZ; NEURAL-NETWORK; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; INTRACRANIAL EEG; SYSTEM; ONSET; SPIKES; BRAIN; HIPPOCAMPUS	Existing automatic detection techniques show high sensitivity and moderate specificity, and detect seizures a relatively long time after onset. High frequency (80-500 Hz) activity has recently been shown to be prominent in the intracranial EEG of epileptic patients but has not been used in seizure detection. The purpose of this study is to investigate if these frequencies can contribute to seizure detection. The system was designed using 30 h of intracranial EEG, including 15 seizures in 15 patients. Wavelet decomposition, feature extraction, adaptive thresholding and artifact removal were employed in training data. An EMG removal algorithm was developed based on two features: Lack of correlation between frequency bands and energy-spread in frequency. Results based on the analysis of testing data (36h of intracranial EEG, including 18 seizures) show a sensitivity of 72%, a false detection of 0.7/h and a median delay of 5.7 s. Missed seizures originated mainly from seizures with subtle or absent high frequencies or from EMG removal procedures. False detections were mainly due to weak EMG or interictal high frequency activities. The system performed sufficiently well to be considered for clinical use, despite the exclusive use of frequencies not usually considered in clinical interpretation. High frequencies have the potential to contribute significantly to the detection of epileptic seizures. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IPEM. All rights reserved.

Epigenetic regulation of RAC1 induces synaptic remodeling in stress disorders and depression	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							SOCIAL DEFEAT STRESS; FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR; SPINE PLASTICITY; DENDRITIC SPINES; RHO; GTPASES; KINASE; MODULATION	Depression induces structural and functional synaptic plasticity in brain reward circuits, although the mechanisms promoting these changes and their relevance to behavioral outcomes are unknown. Transcriptional profiling of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) for Rho GTPase related genes, which are known regulators of synaptic structure, revealed a sustained reduction in RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) expression after chronic social defeat stress. This was associated with a repressive chromatin state surrounding the proximal promoter of Rac1. Inhibition of class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) with MS-275 rescued both the decrease in Rac1 transcription after social defeat stress and depression-related behavior, such as social avoidance. We found a similar repressive chromatin state surrounding the RAC1 promoter in the NAc of subjects with depression, which corresponded with reduced RAC1 transcription. Viral-mediated reduction of Rac1 expression or inhibition of Rac1 activity in the NAc increases social defeat induced social avoidance and anhedonia in mice. Chronic social defeat stress induces the formation of stubby excitatory spines through a Rac1-dependent mechanism involving the redistribution of synaptic cofilin, an actin-severing protein downstream of Rac1. Overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 in the NAc of mice after chronic social defeat stress reverses depression-related behaviors and prunes stubby spines. Taken together, our data identify epigenetic regulation of RAC1 in the NAc as a disease mechanism in depression and reveal a functional role for Rac1 in rodents in regulating stress-related behaviors.

J	Stavro, K; Pelletier, J; Potvin, S				Stavro, Katherine; Pelletier, Julie; Potvin, Stephane			Widespread and sustained cognitive deficits in alcoholism: a meta-analysis	ADDICTION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Alcoholism; attention; executive functions; memory; meta-analysis; visuospatial	ABSTINENT ALCOHOLICS; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; DEPENDENT PATIENTS; DECISION-MAKING; WORKING-MEMORY; DETOXIFIED ALCOHOLICS; CEREBRAL-DYSFUNCTION; EPISODIC MEMORY	The cognitive repercussions of alcohol dependence are well documented. However, the literature remains somewhat ambiguous with respect to which distinct cognitive functions are more susceptible to impairment in alcoholism and to how duration of abstinence affects cognitive recovery. Some theories claim alcohol negatively affects specific cognitive functions, while others assert that deficits are more diffuse in nature. This is the first meta-analysis to examine cognition in alcohol abuse/dependence and the duration of abstinence necessary to achieve cognitive recovery. A literature search yielded 62 studies that assessed cognitive dysfunction among alcoholics. Effect size estimates were calculated using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V2, for the following 12 cognitive domains: intelligence quotient, verbal fluency/language, speed of processing, working memory, attention, problem solving/executive functions, inhibition/impulsivity, verbal learning, verbal memory, visual learning, visual memory and visuospatial abilities. Within these 12 domains, three effect size estimates were calculated based on abstinence duration. The three groups were partitioned into short- (<1 month), intermediate- (2 to 12 months) and long- (>1 year) term abstinence. Findings revealed moderate impairment across 11 cognitive domains during short-term abstinence, with moderate impairment across 10 domains during intermediate term abstinence. Small effect size estimates were found for long-term abstinence. These results suggest significant impairment across multiple cognitive functions remains stable during the first year of abstinence from alcohol. Generally, dysfunction abates by 1 year of sobriety. These findings support the diffuse brain hypothesis and suggest that cognitive dysfunction may linger for up to an average of 1 year post-detoxification from alcohol.

Among brain tumors, high-grade astrocytomas (HGAs) including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are aggressive and are lethal human cancers. Despite decades of concerted therapeutic efforts, HGAs remain essentially incurable in adults and children. Recent discoveries have revolutionized our understanding of these tumors in children and young adults. Recurrent somatic driver mutations in the tail of histone 3 variant 3 (H3.3), leading to amino acid substitutions at key residues, namely lysine (K) 27 (K27M) and glycine 34 (G34R/G34V), were identified as a new molecular mechanism in pediatric GBM. These mutations represent the pediatric counterpart of the recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) identified in young adult gliomas and provide a much-needed new pathway that can be targeted for therapeutic development. This review will provide an overview of the potential role of these mutations in altering chromatin structure and affecting specific molecular pathways ultimately leading to gliomagenesis. The distinct changes in chromatin structure and the specific downstream events induced by each mutation need characterizing independently if progress is to be made in tackling this devastating cancer.

Using combined immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we have shown that amyloid beta 1-15 (A beta 1-15) is produced by concerted beta- and alpha-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and that the relative levels of A beta 1-16 in AD compared to controls are increased. Furthermore, drug-induced gamma-secretase inhibition enhances the relative levels of A beta 1-15 and A beta 1-16. Here, we investigate a novel immunoassay for A beta 1-15/16 in a broad range of neurodegenerative conditions. The CSF level of A beta 1-15/16 was measured by the bead-based amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (Alpha technology). Concentrations of A beta 1-15/16 were analyzed in subjects with Parkinson disease (PD; n = 90), PD with dementia (PDD) (n = 32), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 68), AD (n = 48), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 45), multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n = 46), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) (n = 12). The detecting antibody is specific to the C-terminal epitope of A beta 15. We found that a carboxypeptidase (CPB) present in fetal bovine serum (FBS), a component of the buffers used, degrades A beta 1-16 to A beta 1-15, which is then detected by the A beta 1-15/16 assay. Significantly, lower levels of A beta 1-15/16 were detected in PD, PDD, PSP, and MSA compared to other neurodegenerative diseases and controls. Using the specific A beta 1-15/16 assay, a reliable quantification of A beta 1-15 or A beta 1-15/16 in CSF samples is obtained. We found reduced levels of A beta 1-15 in parkinsonian disease groups. The molecular mechanism behind this reduction is at present unknown.

Assessment of neuroretinal function in a group of functional amblyopes with documented LGN deficits	OPHTHALMIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS			English	Article						amblyopia; multifocal electroretinogram; lateral geniculate nucleus; functional MRI; optical coherence tomography; fixation stability	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; MULTIFOCAL ELECTRORETINOGRAM; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; ANISOMETROPIC AMBLYOPIA; BINOCULAR COMPETITION; SPATIAL LOCALIZATION; CONVERGENT SQUINT; UNSTEADY FIXATION	Purpose In this study we examine neuroretinal function in five amblyopes, who had been shown in previous functional MRI (fMRI) studies to have compromised function of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), to determine if the fMRI deficit in amblyopia may have its origin at the retinal level. Methods We used slow flash multifocal ERG (mfERG) and compared averaged five ring responses of the amblyopic and fellow eyes across a 35deg field. Central responses were also assessed over a field which was about 6.3deg in diameter. We measured central retinal thickness using optical coherence tomography. Central fields were measured using the MP1-Microperimeter which also assesses ocular fixation during perimetry. MfERG data were compared with fMRI results from a previous study. Results Amblyopic eyes had reduced response density amplitudes (first major negative to first positive (N1-P1) responses) for the central and paracentral retina (up to 18deg diameter) but not for the mid-periphery (from 18 to 35deg). Retinal thickness was within normal limits for all eyes, and not different between amblyopic and fellow eyes. Fixation was maintained within the central 4 degrees more than 80% of the time by four of the five participants; fixation assessed using bivariate contour ellipse areas (BCEA) gave rankings similar to those of the MP-1 system. There was no significant relationship between BCEA and mfERG response for either amblyopic or fellow eye. There was no significant relationship between the central mfERG eye response difference and the selective blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) LGN eye response difference previously seen in these participants. Conclusions Retinal responses in amblyopes can be reduced within the central field without an obvious anatomical basis. Additionally, this retinal deficit may not be the reason why the LGN BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) responses are reduced for amblyopic eye stimulation.

Transurethral Laser Surgery for Benign Prostate Hyperplasia in Octogenarians: Safety and Outcomes	UROLOGY			English	Article							URINARY-INCONTINENCE; EVENT ANALYSIS; RESECTION; MORBIDITY; POPULATION; SYMPTOMS; IMPACT; TIME; AGE	OBJECTIVE To evaluate the morbidity and perioperative outcome of different laser prostate techniques among octogenarians. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of our prospectively maintained laser prostate surgery database between 1998 and 2012. We identified 264 octogenarians (16.5%) who underwent laser prostate surgery. Perioperative morbidity and mortality in addition to the functional outcome of these procedures were assessed. Risk factors and predictors of the outcome were analyzed. RESULTS The mean age at time of procedure was 84 +/- 3.5 years. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate was done in 171 (64.7%), holmium laser ablation of the prostate in 16 (6%), holmium laser transurethral incision of the prostate in 13 (5%) and photoselective vaporization of the prostate in 64 (24.3%). Procedures for octogenarians increased from 11% at the end of 2002 to 19% at 2012. A total of 68 perioperative complications occurred in 52 procedures (19.6%), without any perioperative deaths. There were 56 (82.3%) low-grade complications (Clavien grade I-II) and 12 (17.7%) high-grade complications (Clavien grade >= III). A longer operating time was an independent risk factor for perioperative morbidity on multivariate analysis. Significant improvement of symptoms score (International Prostate Symptom Score-Quality of Life) associated with objective improvement of urine flow parameters (maximum flow [Q-max] and postvoid residual) were reported at different follow-up assessments in the first year (P <.05). Persistent urge or stress incontinence, or both, were found in 4 (1.5%). Total urinary incontinence occurred in 1 patient, with neurologic deficit as the underlying cause. De novo urethral stricture was reported in 8 patients (3%). CONCLUSION Octogenarians undergoing laser prostate surgery for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia have limited perioperative morbidity. Laser prostate surgery can achieve good functional outcome and maintain quality of life of seniors. Furthermore, it is safe in seniors with a high morbidity index; however, longer operating time is an independent risk factor for perioperative morbidity. UROLOGY 81: 634-639, 2013.

Currently, the most common approach is fixed-frequency stimulation (periodic pacing) by means of stimulating devices that operate under open-loop control. However, a drawback of this DBS strategy is the impossibility of tailoring a personalized treatment, which also limits the optimization of the stimulating apparatus. Here, we propose a novel DBS methodology based on a closed-loop control strategy, developed by exploiting statistical machine learning techniques, in which stimulation parameters are adapted to the current neural activity thus allowing for seizure suppression that is fine-tuned on the individual scale (adaptive stimulation). By means of field potential recording from adult rat hippocampus-entorhinal cortex (EC) slices treated with the convulsant drug 4-aminopyridine we determined the effectiveness of this approach compared to low-frequency periodic pacing, and found that the closed-loop stimulation strategy: (i) has similar efficacy as low-frequency periodic pacing in suppressing ictal-like events but (ii) is more efficient than periodic pacing in that it requires less electrical pulses. We also provide evidence that the closed-loop stimulation strategy can alternatively be employed to tune the frequency of a periodic pacing strategy. Our findings indicate that the adaptive stimulation strategy may represent a novel, promising approach to DBS for individually-tailored epilepsy treatment (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evidence suggests visuomotor learning deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the exact nature of these deficits and the ability of dopamine medication to improve them are under-explored. Previous studies suggested that learning driven by large and small movement errors engaged distinct neural mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether PD patients have a generalized impairment in visuomotor learning or selective deficits in learning from large explicit errors which engages cognitive strategies or small imperceptible movement errors involving primarily implicit learning processes. Visuomotor learning skills of non-medicated and medicated patients were assessed in two reaching tasks in which the size of visuospatial errors experienced during learning was manipulated using a novel three-dimensional virtual reality environment. In the explicit perturbation task, the visuomotor perturbation was applied suddenly resulting in large consciously detected initial spatial errors, whereas in the implicit perturbation task, the perturbation was gradually introduced in small undetectable steps such that subjects never experienced large movement errors. A major finding of this study was that PD patients in non-medicated and medicated conditions displayed slower learning rates and smaller adaptation magnitudes than healthy subjects in the explicit perturbation task, but performance similar to healthy controls in the implicit perturbation task. Also, non-medicated patients showed an average reduced deadaptation relative to healthy controls when exposed to the large errors produced by the sudden removal of the perturbation in both the explicit and implicit perturbation tasks. Although dopaminergic medication consistently improved motor signs, it produced a variable impact on learning the explicit perturbation and deadaptation and unexpectedly worsened performance in some patients. Considered together, these results indicate that PD selectively impairs the ability to learn from large consciously detected visuospatial errors. This finding suggests that basal ganglia-related circuits are important neural structures for adaptation to sudden perturbations requiring awareness and high-cost action selection. Dopaminergic treatment may selectively compromise the ability to learn from large explicit movement errors for reasons that remain to be elucidated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evidence to support that adventitial cysts, analogous to intraneural ganglion cysts, are also joint-connected	CLINICAL ANATOMY			English	Article						cystic adventitial disease; adventitial cyst; middle genicular artery; unifying articular theory; popliteal artery	PERIPHERAL-BLOOD VESSELS; COMMON FEMORAL-ARTERY; OF-THE-LITERATURE; POPLITEAL ARTERY; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; RADIAL ARTERY; KNEE-JOINT; INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION; PERCUTANEOUS THERAPY; RADIOLOGICAL ASPECTS	Cystic adventitial disease (CAD) is a rare condition in which cyst is found within a vessel, typically producing symptoms of vascular compromise. Most commonly located in the popliteal artery near the knee, it has been reported in arteries and veins throughout the body. Its pathogenesis has been poorly understood and various surgical approaches have been recommended. We extrapolated some recent information about a similar condition, intraneural ganglion cyst affecting the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve, to the prototype, CAD of the popliteal artery. In intraneural ganglion cysts affecting the deep fibular nerve we have shown that an articular (neural) branch is the conduit between the superior tibiofibular joint and the main parent nerve for which epineurial dissection of joint fluid can occur. We hypothesized that the same principles would apply to CAD and that an articular (vascular) branch would be the conduit from the knee joint leading to dissection to the main parent vessel. We reviewed five patients with CAD of the popliteal artery in whom MRIs were available: two treated by the primary author well familiar with the proposed articular theory, and three treated by others at our institution, less familiar with it. We then reviewed the literature critically to assess for additional evidence to support our articular (synovial) theory and an anatomic explanation. In the two cases treated by the primary author a joint connection was identified on high resolution MRI prospectively and intraoperatively through the middle genicular artery (MGA); postoperatively in these cases there was no recurrence. In the other three cases, a joint connection was not identified on imaging or at operation. Reinterpretation of these cases revealed a joint connection through the MGA in the one patient who had preoperative imaging and subclinical persistence/recurrence in the two patients who underwent postoperative MRIs done for other reasons. Our review of the literature and imaging studies revealed unrecognized joint connections in CAD to the knee and other joints as well as evidence that the MGA is the conduit in cases of CAD of the popliteal artery. We believe that adventitial cysts originate in neighboring joints and dissect within articular (vascular) branches. In our opinion, the unifying articular theory and the principles introduced for intraneural ganglion cysts apply equally to common and rare sites of adventitial cysts. Clin. Anat., 2013.

Here, we examined whether FTO is associated with total brain volume in adolescence, thus exploring possible developmental effects of FTO. We studied a population-based sample of 598 adolescents recruited from the French Canadian founder population in whom we measured brain volume by magnetic resonance imaging. Total fat mass was assessed with bioimpedance and body mass index was determined with anthropometry. Genotypephenotype associations were tested with Merlin under an additive model. We found that the G allele of FTO (rs9930333) was associated with higher total body fat [TBF (P 0.002) and lower brain volume (P 0.005)]. The same allele was also associated with higher lean body mass (P 0.03) and no difference in height (P 0.99). Principal component analysis identified a shared inverse variance between the brain volume and TBF, which was associated with FTO at P 5.5 10(6). These results were replicated in two independent samples of 413 and 718 adolescents, and in a meta-analysis of all three samples (n 1729 adolescents), FTO was associated with this shared inverse variance at P 1.3 10(9). Co-expression networks analysis supported the possibility that the underlying FTO effects may occur during embryogenesis. In conclusion, FTO is associated with shared inverse variance between body adiposity and brain volume, suggesting that this gene may exert inverse effects on adipose and brain tissues. Given the completion of the overall brain growth in early childhood, these effects may have their origins during early development.

These genes have been postulated to play significant roles in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, such as histone modifications in gene regulatory regions, have also been proposed to play a role in a number of psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. One of the best characterized histone modifications is histone 3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3), an epigenetic mark shown to be highly enriched at transcriptional start sites and associated with active transcription. In the present study we have quantified the expression of transcript variants of the three synapsin genes and investigated their relationship to H3K4me3 promoter enrichment in post-mortem brain samples. We found that histone modification marks were significantly increased in bipolar disorder and major depression and this effect was correlated with significant increases in gene expression. Our findings suggest that synapsin dysregulation in mood disorders is mediated in part by epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.

Electrophysiological recordings in the rat brain have already shown that chronic VNS increases norepinephrine (NE) neuronal firing activity and, subsequently, that of serotonin (5-HT) neurons through an activation of their excitatory alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Long-term VNS was shown to increase the tonic activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus. This study was aimed at examining the effect of VNS on extracellular 5-HT, NE and dopamine (DA) levels in different brain areas using in vivo microdialysis, on NE transmission in the hippocampus, and DA neuronal firing activity using electrophysiology. Rats were implanted with a VNS device and stimulated for 14 d with standard parameters used in treatment-resistant depression (0.25 mA, 20 Hz, 500 ms, 30 s on-5 min off). The results of the present study revealed that 2-wk VNS significantly increased extracellular NE levels in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus and enhanced the tonic activation of post-synaptic alpha(2)-adrenoceptors on pyramidal neurons. The electrophysiological experiments revealed a significant decrease in ventral tegmental area DA neuronal firing rate after long-term VNS; extracellular DA levels were nevertheless increased in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Chronic VNS significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels in the dorsal raphe but not in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, the effect of VNS in increasing the transmission of monoaminergic systems targeted in the treatment of resistant depression should be involved, at least in part, in its antidepressant properties observed in patients not responding to many antidepressant strategies.

Mutations in POLR3A and POLR3B genes were recently reported to cause four clinically overlapping hypomyelinating leukodystrophy phenotypes. Our aim was to investigate the presence and frequency of POLR3A and POLR3B mutations in patients with genetically unexplained hypomyelinating leukodystrophies with typical clinical and/or radiologic features of Pol III-related leukodystrophies. Methods The entire coding region and the flanking exon/intron boundaries of POLR3A and/or POLR3B genes were amplified and sequenced in 14 patients. Results Recessive mutations in POLR3A or POLR3B were uncovered in all 14 patients. Eight novel mutations were identified in POLR3A: six missenses, one nonsense, and one frameshift mutation. Seven patients carried compound heterozygous mutations in POLR3B, of whom six shared the common mutation in exon 15 (p.V523E). Seven novel mutations were identified in POLR3B: four missenses, two splice sites, and one intronic mutation. Conclusions To date, our group has described 37 patients, of whom 27 have mutations in POLR3A and 10 in POLR3B, respectively. Altogether, our results further support the proposal that POLR3A and POLR3B mutations are a major cause of hypomyelinating leukodystrophies and suggest that POLR3A mutations are more frequent.

Recent findings suggesting the coexpression of metabotropic P2Y receptors with P2X3 implies that ATP release triggers the activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic purinoceptors, with strong potential for functional interaction. Modulation of native P2X3 function by P2Y receptor activation was investigated in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons using whole cell patch-clamp recordings. Application of the selective P2Y receptor agonist UTP decreased peak amplitudes of alpha,beta-meATP-evoked homomeric P2X3-mediated currents, but had no effect on heteromeric P2X2/3-mediated currents. Treatment with phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 significantly reversed P2X3 current inhibition induced by UTP-sensitive P2Y receptor activation. We previously reported the modulation of P2X receptors by phospholipids in DRG neurons and injection of exogenous phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) fully reverses UTP-mediated regulation of P2X3 channel activity. Pharmacological as well as functional screening of P2Y receptor subtypes indicates the predominant involvement of P2Y2 receptor in P2X3 inhibition, and immunolocalization confirms a significant cellular coexpression of P2X3 and P2Y2 in rat DRG neurons. In summary, the function of P2X3 ATP receptor can be inhibited by P2Y2-mediated depletion of PIP2. We propose that expression of P2Y2 purinoceptor in nociceptive sensory neurons provides an homeostatic mechanism to prevent excessive ATP signaling through P2X3 receptor channels.

Jeff			Clinically Meaningful Efficacy and Acceptability of Low-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for Treating Primary Major Depression: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized, Double-Blind and Sham-Controlled Trials	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						depression (unipolar/bipolar); psychiatry & behavioral sciences; neurophysiology; mood/anxiety/stress disorders; transcranial magnetic stimulation; meta-analysis	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDICATION-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; ASTERISK-D REPORT; BRAIN-STIMULATION; ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; OUTCOMES; SAFETY; SCALE	Clinical trials on low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have yielded conflicting evidence concerning its overall efficacy for treating major depression (MD). As this may have been the result of limited statistical power of individual trials, we have carried the present systematic review and meta-analysis to examine this issue. We searched the literature for English language randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) on LF-rTMS for treating MD from 1995 through July 2012 using EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and from October 2008 until July 2012 using MEDLINE. The main outcome measures were response and remission rates as well as overall dropout rates at study end. We used a random-effects model, odds ratios (ORs) and number needed to treat (NNT). Data were obtained from eight RCTs, totaling 263 subjects with MD. After an average of 12.6 +/- 3.9 rTMS sessions, 38.2% (50/131) and 15.1% (20/132) of subjects receiving active LF-rTMS and sham rTMS were classified as responders (OR=3.35; 95% CI=1.4-8.02; p=0.007). Also, 34.6% (35/101) and 9.7% (10/103) of subjects receiving active LF-rTMS and sham rTMS were classified as remitters (OR=4.76; 95% CI=2.13-10.64; p<0.0001). The associated NNT for both response and remission rates was 5. Sensitivity analyses have shown that protocols delivering >1200 magnetic pulses in total as well as those offering rTMS as a monotherapy for MD were associated with higher rates of response to treatment No differences on mean baseline depression scores and dropout rates for active and sham rTMS groups were found. Finally, the risk of publication bias was low. In conclusion, LF-rTMS is a promising treatment for MD, as it provides clinically meaningful benefits that are comparable to those of standard antidepressants and high-frequency rTMS. Furthermore, LF-rTMS seems to be an acceptable intervention for depressed subjects.

High temporal discounters overvalue immediate rewards rather than undervalue future rewards: An event-related brain potential study	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Decision-making; Dopamine; ERP; Reward	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; TIME-ESTIMATION TASK; DELAYED REWARDS; DOPAMINE; IMPULSIVITY; CHOICE; ACTIVATION; POSITIVITY; MOTIVATION	Impulsivity is characterized in part by heightened sensitivity to immediate relative to future rewards. Although previous research has suggested that "high discounters" in intertemporal choice tasks tend to prefer immediate over future rewards because they devalue the latter, it remains possible that they instead overvalue immediate rewards. To investigate this question, we recorded the reward positivity, a component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) associated with reward processing, with participants engaged in a task in which they received both immediate and future rewards and nonrewards. The participants also completed a temporal discounting task without ERP recording. We found that immediate but not future rewards elicited the reward positivity. High discounters also produced larger reward positivities to immediate rewards than did low discounters, indicating that high discounters relatively overvalued immediate rewards. These findings suggest that high discounters may be more motivated than low discounters to work for monetary rewards, irrespective of the time of arrival of the incentives.

Methods: Fifty-nine patients performed rapid flexion movements of the right arm under 6 conditions, namely a control condition and conditions with different attention demands. The latency between the activations of the shoulder and different trunk muscles, as measured with surface electromyography, was used as the outcome. Using repeated measures analysis of variance, attention conditions and group comparisons were tested between those who scored high and low on pain intensity, fear of movement, or pain catastrophizing. Results: There were significant (although minimal) interactive effects but significant and potentially clinically relevant group and attention main effects. The group with the lowest scores showed delayed activity (14 to 29 ms) relative to those with higher scores. One attention-demanding condition delayed (20 to 35 ms) the latencies of some trunk muscles relative to the control condition, namely the one that was the most attention-demanding according to the reaction time results. Discussion: These findings suggest that patients with chronic low back pain, who are characterized by higher scores on some pain-related variables (visual analog scale, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, Pain Catastrophizing Scale), react favorably to protect the spine from further pain and injuries but would be at greater risk of injury when performing a complex physical task requiring more attention demand.

In seeking a way forward, it may be useful to consider the problems of integrating two complex fields in the context of disciplinary boundaries. Here, a boundary perspective is used as a lens for analyzing the results of a systematic review of the educational neuroscience literature. Recurring vocabulary used within the literature suggests indirect use of boundary principles, including the idea of connections and bridges between disciplines, inter-, multi-, and transdisciplinarity, and reference to tools (boundary objects) and people that may be useful in the evolving field of educational neuroscience. Analyzing the educational neuroscience literature through the lens of boundary principles indicates that the boundary between the two disciplines may itself be a bridging mechanism useful for the creation of a new discipline and new knowledge.

The planar cell polarity pathway controls the neural tube closure and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects both in animal models and human cohorts. In mouse disruption of Dvl2 alone (Dvl2 (-/-)) or Dvl2 and Dvl3 (Dvl2 (-/-); Dvl3 (+/-), Dvl2 (+/-); Dvl3 (-/-)) results in incomplete neurulation, suggesting a role for Disheveled in neural tube closure. Disheveled is a multifunctional protein that is involved in both the canonical Wnt signaling and the noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway. In this study, we analyzed the role of the human orthologs DVL2 and DVL3 in a cohort of 473 patients with neural tube defects. Rare variants were genotyped in 639 ethnically matched controls. We identified seven rare missense mutations that were absent in all controls analyzed. Two of these mutations, p.Tyr667Cys and p.Ala53Val, identified in DVL2 were predicted to be detrimental in silico. Significantly, a 1-bp insertion (c.1801_1802insG) in exon 15 of DVL2 predicted to lead to the truncation of the protein was identified in a patient with a complex form of caudal agenesis. In summary, we demonstrate a possible role for rare variants in DVL2 gene as risk factors for neural tube defects.

Coupling of cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism is conserved for chromatic and luminance stimuli in human visual cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cerebral blood flow (CBF); Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2); Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD); Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Cytochrome oxidase blobs	MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; CALIBRATED-BOLD FMRI; LABELING FUNCTIONAL MRI; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; BRAIN ACTIVATION; SOMATOSENSORY STIMULATION; BASE-LINE; HUMAN V1; CONSUMPTION	The ratio of the changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) during brain activation is a critical determinant of the magnitude of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Cytochrome oxidase (CO), a key component of oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria, is non-uniformly distributed in visual area VI in distinct blob and interblob regions, suggesting significant spatial variation in the capacity for oxygen metabolism. The goal of this study was to test whether CBF/CMRO2 coupling differed when these subpopulations of neurons were preferentially stimulated, using chromatic and luminance stimuli to preferentially stimulate either the blob or interblob regions. A dual-echo spiral arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique was used to measure CBF and BOLD responses simultaneously in 7 healthy human subjects. When the stimulus contrast levels were adjusted to evoke similar CBF responses (mean 65.4% +/- 19.0% and 64.6% +/- 19.9%, respectively for chromatic and luminance contrast), the BOLD responses were remarkably similar (1.57% +/- 0.39% and 1.59% +/- 0.35%) for both types of stimuli. We conclude that CBF-CMRO2 coupling is conserved for the chromatic and luminance stimuli used, suggesting a consistent coupling for blob and inter-blob neuronal populations despite the difference in CO concentration.

Interacting Cortical and Basal Ganglia Networks Underlying Finding and Tapping to the Musical Beat	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SCANNER BACKGROUND-NOISE; NEURAL REPRESENTATION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; MEMORY RETRIEVAL; BRAIN ACTIVATION; WORKING-MEMORY; MOTOR AREAS; RHYTHM; FMRI	Humans are able to find and tap to the beat of musical rhythms varying in complexity from children's songs to modern jazz. Musical beat has no one-to-one relationship with auditory features-it is an abstract perceptual representation that emerges from the interaction between sensory cues and higher-level cognitive organization. Previous investigations have examined the neural basis of beat processing but have not tested the core phenomenon of finding and tapping to the musical beat. To test this, we used fMRI and had musicians find and tap to the beat of rhythms that varied from metrically simple to metrically complex-thus from a strong to a weak beat. Unlike most previous studies, we measured beat tapping performance during scanning and controlled for possible effects of scanner noise on beat perception. Results showed that beat finding and tapping recruited largely overlapping brain regions, including the superior temporal gyrus (STG), premotor cortex, and ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC). Beat tapping activity in STG and VLPFC was correlated with both perception and performance, suggesting that they are important for retrieving, selecting, and maintaining the musical beat. In contrast BG activity was similar in all conditions and was not correlated with either perception or production, suggesting that it may be involved in detecting auditory temporal regularity or in associating auditory stimuli with a motor response. Importantly, functional connectivity analyses showed that these systems interact, indicating that more basic sensorimotor mechanisms instantiated in the BG work in tandem with higher-order cognitive mechanisms in PFC.

Anterior cingulate cortical thickness is a stable predictor of recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Cortical thickness; magnetic resonance imaging; medial prefrontal cortex; post-traumatic stress disorder; recovery	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR THERAPY; STRUCTURAL BRAIN ABNORMALITIES; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; TREATMENT RESPONSE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SYMPTOM SEVERITY; FEAR EXTINCTION; COPING STYLE; MRI DATA; PTSD	Background. Decreased cortical thickness in frontal and temporal regions has been observed in individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compared to healthy controls and trauma-exposed participants without PTSD. In addition, individual differences, both functional and structural, in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have been shown to predict symptom severity reduction. Although there is some evidence suggesting that activity in this region changes as a function of recovery, it remains unknown whether there are any structural correlates of recovery from PTSD. Method. Thirty participants suffering from moderate to severe PTSD underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan following an initial clinical assessment. A second assessment took place 6-9 months later. In addition, a subgroup of 25 participants completed a second MRI scan at that time. PTSD symptom severity changes over time were regressed against vertex-based cortical thickness. Results. We found that cortical thickness in the right subgenual ACC (sgACC) predicted symptom improvement. Moreover, cortical thickness within this region of the ACC, measured 6-9 months later (n=25), was also correlated with the same measure of symptom improvement. By contrast, no relationship was found between change in cortical thickness in this area and current PTSD symptom levels or degree of recovery. Conclusions. Our results suggest that sgACC thickness may be a stable marker of recovery potential in PTSD.	[Dickie, E. W.; Brunet, A.; Akerib, V.; Armony, J.

The aims were to explore the number of falls older adults report in the 6 months after cancer diagnosis, and if those with a fall were more frail than those who did not fall. Secondary data analysis of a prospective pilot study that recruited patients aged 65 and older with a new cancer diagnosis. At each interview (baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up), participants were asked if they had a fall in the previous 3 months. The frailty markers and functional status were obtained at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up. Chi-square and t tests were used to compare those who had a fall to those who had no fall. Univariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the association between sociodemographic and health characteristics and reporting a fall. Seventeen participants (18.7 %) reported one or more falls in the first 6 months after cancer diagnosis. Fifteen participants reported one or more falls in the 3 months prior to the cancer diagnosis. Those who had a fall and those with no fall were not different in terms of health and functioning. None of the sociodemographic and health characteristics including the frailty markers were associated with a fall. A fall is common in cancer patients. More research is needed to examine the risk factors for a fall in older adults receiving cancer treatment.	[Puts, Martine T.

Despite the increasing attention paid to the cognitive and emotional mechanisms that underlie the perception of such artifacts, research that explores the neurobiological determinants of these mechanisms has only recently begun to emerge. The primary argument for the use of neurobiological approaches in IS design science research is that IT artifact design - and, ultimately, human-computer interaction in general - may significantly benefit from neuroscience theories, concepts, methods, and data. In particular, the consideration of neuroscience may improve IT artifacts' alignment with users' perceptual and information processing mechanisms, particularly the brain. Against this background, this article presents a taxonomy of application strategies for neuroscience in IS design science research. It describes three major areas of application and explains that conducting research in an area comes with a specific set of requirements (e.g., applicability, costs, accessibility, and knowledge relevant to planning and conducting a research project). Therefore, if an IS design science scholar decides to draw upon neuroscience, the taxonomy transparently explains possible working areas and corresponding requirements. The taxonomy is described based on example studies published in the IS literature and on contributions that appeared in outlets pertaining to related disciplines, such as affective computing and neuroergonomics. The article concludes that, if neuroscience is considered a valuable complement to the more traditional approaches, it has the potential to become a major reference discipline for IS design science research.

Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome was considered in view of multisystem involvement. Exome sequencing, revealed a homozygous novel mutation c.1183T>C (p.F395L) in exon 1 of the C10orf2 TWINKLE gene. The hepatocerebral phenotype is well recognized in association with recessive mutations involving the C10orf2 TWINKLE gene. The feature of renal tubulopathy adds to the multisystemic presentation in our patients and further demonstrates an expansion of the phenotype in mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome associated with TWINKLE gene mutations. The absence of features of an epileptic encephalopathy appears to be of added interest. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Prasad, Chitra; Rupar, C.

We identified more than 700 lipid moieties and above 1,000 proteins in the two species, including 284 common lipids and 257 common proteins. This study establishes the first comprehensive map of myelin membrane components in human and mice. Although this study demonstrates many similarities between human and murine myelin, several components have been identified exclusively in each species. Future quantitative validation studies focused on interspecies differences will authenticate the myelin membrane anatomy. The combined lipidome and proteome map presented here can nevertheless be used as a reference library for myelin health and disease. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Little is known, however, about neural circuitry underlying decision-making in adolescent attempters. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess decision-making and learning-related neural activity during Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) performance in adolescents with depression and suicide attempt (ATT, n=15), non-attempters with depression (NAT, n=14), and healthy controls (HC, n=13). ATT performed best on the IGT. A three group by two condition (high-risk versus low-risk) by three IGT block (each of 20 cards) whole-brain analysis (p < 0.05, corrected) interaction was found in the left hippocampal, frontal and temporal cortical, striatal and thalamic regions. Post-hoc analyses revealed that during low-risk decisions in blocks 2 and 3, NAT, but not ATT, showed greater left hippocampal activation versus HC (p=0.0004, p = 0.003); in block 2, during low-risk decisions NAT showed greater left middle temporal gyral activation versus HC (p=0.003); in block 3, during high-risk decisions ATT showed less activation in the right thalamus versus NAT (p=0.001) and during low risk decisions ATT showed greater activation than HC in the left caudate (p=0.002). NAT, but not ATT are differentiated from HC during performance of the IGT. Functional abnormalities in neural circuitry implicated in learning in the context of risk may underlie risk for MDD, but not risk for suicide attempt, in adolescence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It arises mainly from a sparse population of cholinergic interneurons located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This population was thought to be absent from the spinal cord of monkey, what might suggest that spinal ACh would not be a relevant clinical target for pain therapy. In humans, however, pain responses can be modulated by spinal ACh, as evidenced by the increasingly used analgesic procedure (for postoperative and labor patients) consisting of the epidural injection of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine. The source and target of this ACh remain yet to be elucidated. In this study, we used an immunolabeling for choline acetyltransferase to demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of a plexus of cholinergic fibers in laminae II-III of the dorsal horn of the macaque monkey. Moreover, we show the presence of numerous cholinergic cell bodies within the same laminae and compared their density and morphological properties with those previously described in rodents. An electron microscopy analysis demonstrates that cholinergic boutons are presynaptic to dorsal horn neurons as well as to the terminals of sensory primary afferents, suggesting that they are likely to modulate incoming somatosensory information. Our data suggest that this newly identified dorsal horn cholinergic system in monkeys is the source of the ACh involved in the analgesic effects of epidural neostigmine and could be more specifically targeted for novel therapeutic strategies for pain management in humans.

Identification of Nonvisual Photomotor Response Cells in the Vertebrate Hindbrain	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ZEBRAFISH DANIO-RERIO; DEEP BRAIN; IN-VIVO; PHOTORECEPTIVE MOLECULE; LARVAL ZEBRAFISH; LOCOMOTOR NETWORK; GANGLION-CELLS; LIGHT; PINEAL; OPSIN	Nonvisual photosensation enables animals to sense light without sight. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of nonvisual photobehaviors are poorly understood, especially in vertebrate animals. Here, we describe the photomotor response (PMR), a robust and reproducible series of motor behaviors in zebrafish that is elicited by visual wavelengths of light but does not require the eyes, pineal gland, or other canonical deep-brain photoreceptive organs. Unlike the relatively slow effects of canonical nonvisual pathways, motor circuits are strongly and quickly (seconds) recruited during the PMR behavior. We find that the hindbrain is both necessary and sufficient to drive these behaviors. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we identify a discrete set of neurons within the hindbrain whose responses to light mirror the PMR behavior.

Neto2 is a KCC2 interacting protein required for neuronal Cl- regulation in hippocampal neurons	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						chloride; GABA	CATION-CHLORIDE COTRANSPORTERS; KAINATE RECEPTORS; AUXILIARY SUBUNIT; CREATINE-KINASE; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GENE FAMILY; CUB-DOMAIN; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; HOMEOSTASIS	KCC2 is a neuron-specific K+ -Cl- cotransporter that is essential for Cl- homeostasis and fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mature CNS. Despite the critical role of KCC2 in neurons, the mechanisms regulating its function are not understood. Here, we show that KCC2 is critically regulated by the single-pass transmembrane protein neuropilin and tolloid like-2 (Neto2). Neto2 is required to maintain the normal abundance of KCC2 and specifically associates. with the active oligomeric form of the transporter. Loss of the Neto2:KCC2 interaction reduced KCC2-mediated Cl extrusion, resulting in decreased synaptic inhibition in hippocampal neurons.

J	Andrews, J; Pruessner, JC				Andrews, Julie; Pruessner, Jens C.			The Combined Propranolol/TSST Paradigm - A New Method for Psychoneuroendocrinology	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE; STRESS RESPONSES; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BLOOD-PRESSURE; CORTISOL; DISORDERS; HUMANS; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; NOREPINEPHRINE; DEPRESSION	Upon perception of a stimulus as stressful, the human brain reacts with the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), to mobilize energy resources to better cope with the stressor. Since the perception of the stressor is the initial stimulus, a synchronicity between the subjective perception of stress and the physiological stress reactivity should be expected. However, according to a recent meta-analysis, these associations are weak and inconsistent. The goal of the current study was to investigate the interaction between the SNS, HPA and subjective stress perceptions, by introducing an experimental manipulation of this interaction. For this purpose, we combined the SNS inhibitor propranolol with the Trier Social Stress Test, and measured endocrinological and psychological responses to the stressor. Thirty healthy male participants were recruited and randomly assigned to either a propranolol (PROP; n = 15) or placebo (PLC; n = 15) group. All subjects were administered 80 mg of propranolol 60 minutes prior to exposure to psychosocial stress. Salivary cortisol and alpha amylase (sAA), heart rate, blood pressure and subjective stress responses were assessed throughout the study. We observed significantly reduced sAA levels and heart rate increases in the PROP group in response to stress, with no effects of the drug on systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes. In line with previous studies, a significant increase in cortisol was seen in response to the stress exposure. Importantly, the cortisol increase was significantly higher in the PROP group. A typical increase in subjective stress could be seen in both groups, with no significant group differences emerging. Complementing previous work, this study further demonstrates a significant interaction between the HPA and the SNS during acute stress. The HPA activity was found to be elevated in the presence of a suppressed SNS in reactivity to the TSST.

In rodents, such effects are induced by tactile maternal stimulation resulting in neuroendocrine modifications of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis involved in stress responsiveness. Whether similar long-term alterations can occur in the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis of poikilothermic vertebrates is unknown. We compared the expression of four genes of the HPI axis in adults of the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, which had been exposed to two early-life social treatments 1.5 years prior to brain sampling. Fish reared with parents and siblings had less brain expression of corticotropin-releasing factor and of the functional homologue of the mammalian glucocorticoid receptor (GR1) than individuals reared with same-age siblings only. Expression of the mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) did not differ between treatments, but the MR/GR1 expression ratio was markedly higher in fish reared with parents and siblings. Thus, we show here that early social experience can alter the programming of the stress axis in poikilothermic vertebrates, suggesting that this mechanism is deeply conserved within vertebrates. Moreover, we show for the first time that reprogramming of the stress axis of a vertebrate can be induced without tactile stimulation by parents.

However, the role of the LC-NA system in the regulation of cortical CBF has remained elusive. This rat study shows that similar proportions (similar to 20%) of cortical pyramidal cells and GABA interneurons are contacted by LC-NA afferents on their cell soma or proximal dendrites. LC stimulation induced ipsilateral activation (c-Fos upregulation) of pyramidal cells and of a larger proportion (>36%) of interneurons that colocalize parvalbumin, somatostatin, or nitric oxide synthase compared with pyramidal cells expressing cyclooxygenase-2 (22%, p<0.05) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-containing interneurons (16%, p<0.01). Concurrently, LC stimulation elicited larger ipsilateral compared with contralateral increases in cortical CBF (52 vs 31%, p<0.01). These CBF responses were almost abolished (-70%, p<0.001) by cortical NA denervation with DSP-4 [N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride] and were significantly reduced by alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (-40%, p<0.001 and -30%, p<0.05, respectively). Blockade of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurotransmission with NMDA or GABA(A) receptor antagonists potently reduced the LC-induced hyperemic response (-56%, p<0.001 or -47%, p<0.05). Moreover, inhibition of astroglial metabolism (-35%, p<0.01), vasoactive epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs; -60%, p<0.001) synthesis, large-conductance, calcium-operated (BK, -52%, p<0.05), and inward-rectifier (Kir, -40%, p<0.05) K+ channels primarily impaired the hyperemic response. The data demonstrate that LC stimulation recruits a broad network of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons resulting in increased cortical activity and that K+ fluxes and EET signaling mediate a large part of the hemodynamic response.

Though neurocognitive changes are gaining increasing attention as part of the vulnerability for suicide, the literature on neurocognitive alterations among suicide relatives as possible endophenotypes of suicide is sparse. Method: Normothymic first-degree relatives (n=14) of suicide completers without personal histories of suicide attempts were compared to individuals without family histories of suicide (n=14) matched for age-, sex- and education. Participants completed the Wisconsin card sorting test, a well validated test of cognitive control in a changing environment. Results: First-degree relatives of suicide completers made significantly more perseverative errors and have a lower level of conceptual responses than comparison subjects. Conclusion: Alterations found in first-degree relatives of suicide completers suggest a decreased responsiveness to changing, yet unambiguous, conditions. These neurocognitive impairments are similar to deficits observed among individuals engaging in suicide attempts. Neurocognitive impairments revealed by the Wisconsin card sorting test may represent a neurocognitive endophenotype of suicide. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ikaros promotes early-born neuronal fates in the cerebral cortex	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						cell fate; stem cells; developmental timing	SUBCORTICAL PROJECTION NEURONS; DNA-BINDING PROTEINS; TEMPORAL IDENTITY; CENTROMERIC HETEROCHROMATIN; LYMPHOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION; DROSOPHILA NEUROBLASTS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; DEVELOPING NEOCORTEX; PROGENITOR CELLS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM	During cerebral cortex development, a series of projection neuron types is generated in a fixed temporal order. In Drosophila neuroblasts, the transcription factor hunchback encodes first-born identity within neural lineages. One of its mammalian homologs, Ikaros, was recently reported to play an equivalent role in retinal progenitor cells, raising the question as to whether Ikaros/Hunchback proteins could be general factors regulating the development of early-born fates throughout the nervous system. Ikaros is also expressed in progenitor cells of the mouse cerebral cortex, and this expression is highest during the early stages of neurogenesis and thereafter decreases over time. Transgenic mice with sustained Ikaros expression in cortical progenitor cells and neurons have developmental defects, including displaced progenitor cells within the cortical plate, increased early neural differentiation, and disrupted cortical lamination. Sustained Ikaros expression results in a prolonged period of generation of deep layer neurons into the stages when, normally, only late-born upper layer neurons are generated, as well as a delayed production of late-born neurons. Consequently, more early-born and fewer late-born neurons are present in the cortex of these mice at birth. This phenotype was observed in all parts of the cortex, including those with minimal structural defects, demonstrating that it is not secondary to abnormalities in cortical morphogenesis. These data suggest that Ikaros plays a similar role in regulating early temporal fates in the mammalian cerebral cortex as Ikaros/Hunchback proteins do in the Drosophila nerve cord.

Behavioural impacts of torpor expression: A transient effect in captive eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus)	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Exploration; Behaviour; Spatial memory; Torpor; Brain structure; Eastern chipmunk	OPEN-FIELD TESTS; EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR; SPATIAL MEMORY; BODY-TEMPERATURE; MAMMALIAN HIBERNATION; HIPPOCAMPAL LESIONS; GROUND-SQUIRRELS; RATS; CITELLUS; NOVELTY	Species use torpor, an extreme form of heterothermy, to survive periods of limited resource supply. Studies of hibernating animals have shown that torpor causes major structural and physiological changes in the brain, many of which are reversed during periodic arousals. This suggests that behaviour may change during and following the hibernation period. Here we investigate individual performance in behavioural tests prior to and during hibernation by captive eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). Results indicate an association between deep torpor expression and atypical habituation patterns tested directly following torpor arousals. However, no association was found between torpor expression and spatial maze performance tested more than 24 h post-arousal. Therefore, any behavioural impairment induced by torpor appears to be highly transient. The detected association between torpor and behaviour may be driven by previously confirmed effects of torpor on brain structure and function, though other potential covariates, such as the activation and deactivation of the stress axis, warrant consideration. Thus, our results are consistent with transient behavioural impairments following torpor arousals, but the causes and longer-term consequences of these transient impairments remain unclear.

Twenty-three healthy participants were presented triads of objects in which either neither, one or both objects in the bottom of the triad were related to the top object, and given two encoding instructions that required them to indicate the number of semantic ("related?") or physical ("smaller?") relationships in the triad. Reaction time decreased with more semantic relationships for both encoding instructions, indicating that semantic analysis was performed during the non-semantic encoding task. Recognition memory was better for the semantic encoding condition ("related?"), but there was no modulation of the number of semantic links on memory performance for either encoding condition. We performed a conjunction analysis on the fMRI data to find areas with greater activity for the non-semantic>semantic encoding tasks that were modulated by increasing semantic relationships during non-semantic encoding. Activity was found in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilaterally in the supramarginal gyrus. We suggest that the DLPFC is the most likely candidate region for the self-initiation of elaborative encoding while the supramarginal activity is likely related to attentional effects.

It is expected that functional connectivity based on resting-state data is reflective of - but not identical to - the underlying anatomical connectivity. However, which functional connectivity analysis methods reliably predict the network structure remains unclear. Here we tested and compared network connectivity analysis methods by applying them to fMRI resting-state time-series obtained from the human visual cortex. The methods evaluated here are those previously tested against simulated data in Smith et al. (Neuroimage, 2011). To this end, we defined regions within retinotopic visual areas V1, V2, and V3 according to their eccentricity in the visual field, delineating central, intermediate, and peripheral eccentricity regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs served as nodes in the models we study. We based our evaluation on the "ground-truth", thoroughly studied retinotopically-organized anatomical connectivity in the monkey visual cortex. For each evaluated method, we computed the fractional rate of detecting connections known to exist ("c-sensitivity"), while using a threshold of the 95th percentile of the distribution of interaction magnitudes of those connections not expected to exist. Under optimal conditions - including session duration of 68 min, a relatively small network consisting of 9 nodes and artifact-free regression of the global effect - each of the top methods predicted the expected connections with 67-85% c-sensitivity. Correlation methods, including Correlation (Corr; 85%), Regularized Inverse Covariance (ICOV; 84%) and Partial Correlation (PCorr; 81%) performed best, followed by Patel's Kappa (80%), Bayesian Network method PC (BayesNet; 77%), General Synchronization measures (67-77%), and Coherence (CohB; 74%). With decreased session duration, these top methods saw decreases in c-sensitivities, achieving 59-76% for 17 min sessions. With a short resting-state fMIR scan of 8.5 min, none of the methods predicted the real network well, with Corr (65%) performing best. With increased complexity of the network from 9 to 36 nodes, multivariate methods including PCorr and BayesNet saw a decrease in performance. Artifact-free regression of the global effect increased the c-sensitivity of the top-performing methods. In an overall evaluation across all tests we performed, correlation methods (Corr, ICOV, and PCorr), Patel's Kappa, and BayesNet method PC set themselves somewhat above all other methods. We propose that data-based calibration based on known anatomical connections be integrated into future network studies, in order to maximize sensitivity and reduce false positives.

To investigate if TDP-43 and FUS contribute to neurodegenerative phenotypes, we turned to a genetically accessible Caenorhabditis elegans model of polyglutamine toxicity. In C. elegans, we observe that genetic loss-of-function mutations for nematode orthologs of TDP-43 or FUS reduced behavioral defects and neurodegeneration caused by huntingtin exon-1 with expanded polyglutamines. Furthermore, using striatal cells from huntingtin knock-in mice we observed that small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) against TDP-43 or FUS reduced cell death caused by mutant huntingtin. Moreover, we found that TDP-43 and the survival factor progranulin (PGRN) genetically interact to regulate polyglutamine toxicity in C. elegans and mammalian cells. Altogether our data point towards a conserved function for TDP-43 and FUS in promoting polyglutamine toxicity and that delivery of PGRN may have therapeutic benefits.

Epileptic discharges can be detectable from background brain activity, provided they are associated with spatially extended generators. Using realistic simulations of epileptic activity, this study evaluates the ability of distributed source localization methods to accurately estimate the location of the generators and their sensitivity to the spatial extent of such generators when using MEG data. Source localization methods based on two types of realistic models have been investigated: (i) brain activity may be modeled using cortical parcels and (ii) brain activity is assumed to be locally smooth within each parcel. A Data Driven Parcellization (DDP) method was used to segment the cortical surface into non-overlapping parcels and diffusion-based spatial priors were used to model local spatial smoothness within parcels. These models were implemented within the Maximum Entropy on the Mean (MEM) and the Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) source localization frameworks. We proposed new methods in this context and compared them with other standard ones using Monte Carlo simulations of realistic MEG data involving sources of several spatial extents and depths. Detection accuracy of each method was quantified using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and localization error metrics. Our results showed that methods implemented within the MEM framework were sensitive to all spatial extents of the sources ranging from 3 cm(2) to 30 cm(2), whatever were the number and size of the parcels defining the model. To reach a similar level of accuracy within the HB framework, a model using parcels larger than the size of the sources should be considered.

An exploratory 4-week trial	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Major depression; Neuroticism; Extraversion	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; TREATMENT RESPONSE; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; MOTOR THRESHOLD; 5-FACTOR MODEL; METAANALYSIS; EFFICACY	Several randomized, controlled trials have found high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) to be effective for treating major depressive disorder (MDD), but its antidepressant mechanisms have yet to be firmly understood. In this context, pre-treatment personality traits and subsequent changes in personality concomitant to treatment may be relevant for our understanding of these mechanisms. To investigate this issue we conducted a naturalistic trial in which 14 subjects with moderate to severe depression were treated with daily HF-rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 4 weeks. Objective depressive symptoms (as assessed by the HAM-D-21) and the major personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion were measured pre-post HF-rTMS. Pre-rTMS levels of extraversion predicted subsequent decrease in depressive symptoms. Also, HF-rTMS treatment resulted in a decrease in neuroticism scores, and this relative decrease was associated with the relative decrease in depression. Our results suggest that HF-rTMS may positively affect the personality dimension of neuroticism. Also, pre-treatment levels of extraversion may predict the subsequent antidepressant response to HF-rTMS. However, further studies with larger samples and controlled designs are needed to better clarify these preliminary findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Simultaneous water activation and glucose metabolic rate imaging with PET	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT; ERROR ANALYSIS; DYNAMIC PET; TRACER; BRAIN; SINGLE; QUANTIFICATION; RECONSTRUCTION	A novel imaging and signal separation strategy is proposed to be able to separate [F-18]FDG and multiple [O-15]H2O signals from a simultaneously acquired dynamic PET acquisition of the two tracers. The technique is based on the fact that the dynamics of the two tracers are very distinct. By adopting an appropriate bolus injection strategy and by defining tailored sets of basis functions that model either the FDG or water component, it is possible to separate the FDG and water signal. The basis functions are inspired from the spectral analysis description of dynamic PET studies and are defined as the convolution of estimated generating functions (GFs) with a set of decaying exponential functions. The GFs are estimated from the overall measured head curve, while the decaying exponential functions are pre-determined. In this work, the time activity curves (TACs) are modelled post-reconstruction but the model can be incorporated in a global 4D reconstruction strategy. Extensive PET simulation studies are performed considering single [F-18]FDG and 6 [O-15]H2O bolus injections for a total acquisition time of 75 min. The proposed method is evaluated at multiple noise levels and different parameters were estimated such as [F-18]FDG uptake and blood flow estimated from the [15O]H2O component, requiring a full dynamic analysis of the two components, static images of [F-18]FDG and the water components as well as [O-15]H2O activation. It is shown that the resulting images and parametric values in ROIs are comparable to images obtained from separate imaging, illustrating the feasibility of simultaneous imaging of [F-18]FDG and [O-15]H2O components.

We investigated cortico-striatal connectivity modifications occurring in HD patients using a novel approach which focuses on the projection of the connectivity profile of the basal ganglia onto the cortex. This approach consists in computing, for each subcortical structure, surface connectivity measures representing its strength of connections to the cortex and comparing these measures across groups. In this study, we focused on Huntington disease as an application of this new approach. First, surface cortico-striatal connectivity measures of a group of healthy subjects were averaged in order to infer the "normal" connectivity profile of the striatum to the cortex. Second, a statistical analysis was performed from the surface connectivity measures of healthy subjects and HD patients in order to detect the cortical gyri presenting altered cortico-striatal connectivity in HD. Lastly, percentage differences of connectivity between healthy subjects and patients were inferred, for each nucleus of the striatum, from the connectivity measures of the cortical gyri presenting a significant connectivity difference between the two groups. These percentage differences characterize the axonal disruptions between the striatum and the cortex occurring in HD. We found selective region-specific degeneration of cortical connections predominating for associative and primary sensorimotor connections and with relative preservation of limbic connections. Our method can be used to infer novel connectivity-based markers of HD pathological process.

Using inactivation of IL-10, we, therefore, investigated whether IL-10 could modulate the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the sensory CVOs, in particular the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT) and area postrema (AP). Findings: Primary OVLT and AP microcultures were established from topographically excised rat pup brain tissue. The microcultures were pretreated with either IL-10 antibodies (AB) (10 mu l/350 mu l medium) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mu l/350 mu l medium) before being incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 mu g/ml) or PBS in complete medium for 6 h. Supernatants were removed from the microcultures after 6 h of incubation with LPS and used for the determination of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Pre-treating the OVLT and AP microcultures with IL-10 antibodies significantly enhanced the LPS-induced increase in TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the supernatant obtained from the microcultures. Conclusions: Our results show for the first time that the LPS-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cells cultured from the AP and OVLT can be modulated in the presence of IL-10 antibodies. Thus, we have identified that the sensory CVOs may have a key role to play in both the initiation and modulation of neuroinflammation.

J	Hebert, S; Fournier, P; Norena, A				Hebert, Sylvie; Fournier, Philippe; Norena, Arnaud			The Auditory Sensitivity is Increased in Tinnitus Ears	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VENTRAL COCHLEAR NUCLEUS; ACOUSTIC TRAUMA IMPLICATIONS; LOUDNESS RECRUITMENT; HEARING-LOSS; ADAPTIVE PLASTICITY; ENCODING INTENSITY; BRAIN-STEM; HYPERACUSIS; THRESHOLD; GROWTH	Increased auditory sensitivity, also called hyperacusis, is a pervasive complaint of people with tinnitus. The high prevalence of hyperacusis in tinnitus subjects suggests that both symptoms have a common origin. It has been suggested that they may result from a maladjusted increase of central gain attributable to sensory deafferentation. More specifically, tinnitus and hyperacusis could result from an increase of spontaneous and stimulus-induced activity, respectively. One prediction of this hypothesis is that auditory sensitivity should be increased in tinnitus compared with non-tinnitus subjects. The purpose of this study was to test this prediction by examining the loudness functions in tinnitus ears (n = 124) compared with non-tinnitus human ears (n = 106). Because tinnitus is often accompanied by hearing loss and that hearing loss makes it difficult to disentangle hypersensitivity (hyperacusis) to loudness recruitment, tinnitus and non-tinnitus ears were carefully matched for hearing loss. Our results show that auditory sensitivity is enhanced in tinnitus subjects compared with non-tinnitus subjects, including subjects with normal audiograms. We interpreted these findings as compatible with a maladaptive central gain in tinnitus.

Cognitive enhancement can be achieved by using psycho-stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine, but very little is known about drugs that can enhance the consolidation phase of memories in the cortex, the brain structure considered to store, at least partially, long-term memories. We used cortex-dependent taste-learning paradigms to test the hypothesis that pharmacological manipulation of the translation initiation eIF2 alpha, which plays a role in hippocampus-dependent memory, can enhance positive or negative forms of taste memories. We found that dephosphorylation (Ser51) of eIF2 alpha, specifically in the cortex, is both correlated with and necessary for normal memory consolidation. To reduce eIF2 alpha phosphorylation and improve memory consolidation, we pharmacologically inhibited one of the eIF2 alpha kinases, PKR, which is known to be involved in brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. Systemic or local microinjection of PKR inhibitor to the gustatory cortex enhanced both positive and negative forms of taste memory in rats and mice. Our results provide clear evidence that PKR plays a major role in cortex-dependent memory consolidation and, therefore, that pharmacological inhibition of PKR is a potential target for drugs to enhance cognition.

Experimental and computational studies have examined the structural basis and the nucleation of short fibrils, but the ability to predict and precisely quantify the stability of larger aggregates has remained elusive. We established a complete classification of fibril shapes and developed a tool called Create Fibril to build such complex, polymorphic, modular structures automatically. We applied stability landscapes, a technique we developed to reveal reliable fibril structural parameters, to assess fibril stability. CreateFibril constructed HET-s, A beta, and amylin fibrils up to 17 nm in length, and utilized a novel dipolar solvent model that captured the effect of dipole-dipole interactions between water and very large molecular systems to assess their aqueous stability. Our results validate experimental data for HET-s and A beta, and suggest novel (to our knowledge) findings for amylin. In particular, we predicted the correct structural parameters (rotation angles, packing distances, hydrogen bond lengths, and helical pitches) for the one and three predominant HET-s protofilaments. We reveal and structurally characterize all known A beta polymorphic fibrils, including structures recently classified as wrapped fibrils. Finally, we elucidate the predominant amylin fibrils and assert that native amylin is more stable than its amyloid form. Create Fibril and a database of all stable polymorphic fibril models we tested, along with their structural energy landscapes, are available at http://amyloid.cs.mcgill.ca.

Previous observations demonstrated higher visceral adipose tissue (VAT) DPP4 gene expression in non-diabetic severely obese men with (MetS+) vs. without (MetS-) MetS. DPP4 mRNA abundance in VAT correlated also with CpG site methylation levels (% Meth) localized within and near its exon 2 (CpG(94) to CpG(102)) in non-diabetic severely obese women, regardless of their MetS status. The actual study tested whether DPP4 % Meth levels in VAT are different between MetS- and MetS+ non-diabetic severely obese subjects, whether variable metabolic and plasma lipid profiles are observed between DPP4 % Meth quartiles, and whether correlation exists in DPP4 % Meth levels between VAT and white blood cells (WBCs). Methods: DNA was extracted from the VAT of 26 men (MetS-: n=12, MetS+: n=14) and 79 women (MetS-: n=60; MetS+: n=19), as well as from WBCs in a sub-sample of 17 women (MetS-: n=9; MetS+: n=8). The % Meth levels of CpG(94) to CpG(102) were assessed by pyrosequencing of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA. ANOVA analyses were used to compare the % Meth of CpGs between MetS- and MetS+ groups, and to compare the metabolic phenotype and plasma lipid levels between methylation quartiles. Pearson correlation coefficient analyses were computed to test the relationship between VAT and WBCs CpG(94-102)% Meth levels. Results: No difference was observed in CpG(94-102)% Meth levels between MetS- and MetS+ subjects in VAT (P=0.67), but individuals categorized into CpG(94-102)% Meth quartiles had variable plasma total-cholesterol concentrations (P=0.04). The % Meth levels of four CpGs in VAT were significantly correlated with those observed in WBCs (r=0.55-0.59, P <= 0.03). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that % Meth of CpGs localized within and near the exon 2 of the DPP4 gene in VAT are not associated with MetS status. The actual study also revealed an association between the % Meth of this locus with plasma total-cholesterol in severe obesity, which suggests a link between the DPP4 gene and plasma lipid levels.

What we know today about aging has been largely shaped by a generation who experienced the special circumstances of wartime in their formative years. In this review, we investigate the research question, "What is known about the physical health of Canadian veterans?" In answering this question, we summarize the literature on Canadian Veterans but also include international literature on the physical health of American and Australian Veterans, along with some information from reports from Great Britain and other parts of Europe. Areas in which veterans perhaps fare worse than civilians of similar age include general health, hearing loss, musculoskeletal disorders, infections, cirrhosis, skin conditions, stomach conditions, neurologic conditions, and cardiovascular disease. The differing effects of combat on female veterans are also summarized. The healthy warrior effect is discussed along with its impact on research findings and the importance of choosing an appropriate control group.

However, little is known about sex- and IQ-related differences in the topological organization of functional brain networks during development. In this study, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) was used to map the functional brain networks in 51 healthy children. We then investigated the effects of age, sex, and IQ on economic small-world properties and regional nodal properties of the functional brain networks. At a global level of whole networks, we found significant age-related increases in the small-worldness and local efficiency, significant higher values of the global efficiency in boys compared with girls, and no significant IQ-related difference. Age-related increases in the regional nodal properties were found predominately in the frontal brain regions, whereas the parietal, temporal, and occipital brain regions showed age-related decreases. Significant sex- related differences in the regional nodal properties were found in various brain regions, primarily related to the default mode, language, and vision systems. Positive correlations between IQ and the regional nodal properties were found in several brain regions related to the attention system, whereas negative correlations were found in various brain regions primarily involved in the default mode, emotion, and language systems. Together, our findings of the network topology of the functional brain networks in healthy children and its relationship with age, sex, and IQ bring new insights into the understanding of brain maturation and cognitive development during childhood and adolescence.

The present study extends the question to explore if delayed acquisition of a first language also modulates the structural development of the brain. To this end, we carried out anatomical MRI in the same group of congenitally deaf individuals who varied in the age of acquisition of a first language, American Sign Language -ASL (Mayberry et al., 2011) and used a neuroanatomical technique, Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM), to explore changes in gray and white matter concentrations across the brain related to the age of first language acquisition. The results show that delayed acquisition of a first language is associated with changes in tissue concentration in the occipital cortex close to the area that has been found to show functional recruitment during language processing in these deaf individuals with a late age of acquisition. These findings suggest that a lack of early language experience affects not only the functional but also the anatomical organization of the brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Segmentation of magnetization transfer ratio lesions for longitudinal analysis of demyelination and remyelination in multiple sclerosis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetization transfer ratio; Multiple sclerosis; Remyelination; Image processing	WHITE-MATTER; EVOLUTION; BRAIN; APPEARANCE; RESONANCE; MYELIN; MR; MS	We demonstrate a new technique to quantify longitudinal changes in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These changes are indicative of demyelination and remyelination. This technique comprises a definition of Delta MTR lesions, which are identified directly from the MTR images, and an automatic procedure for segmenting these lesions. We used this technique to analyze MTR changes in lesions of subjects with rapidly progressing multiple sclerosis before and after treatment with immunoablation and autologous stem cell transplant. Subjects who experienced clinical improvement after treatment showed significantly improved MTR recovery in lesions that were recovering during treatment (p<0.0001) while those who were clinically stable after treatment showed significantly poorer MTR recovery (p=0.002). The statistical power of this technique to detect treatment effects on MTR recovery was shown to be considerably better than previous methods. These results suggest that longitudinal measurements of MTR in Delta MTR lesions may be an important technique for the assessment of treatment effects on remyelination in clinical trials.

While a general consensus on the functional anatomy of olfactory cortex is beginning to emerge, the mechanisms behind the functions of individual processing nodes still remain debated. Further, it remains unclear to which extent divergent findings result from differences in methodological approaches. Using Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE), the aim of the present study was to statistically combine all published data on functional neuroimaging of olfaction to provide a probability map reflecting the state of the field to date. Additionally, we grouped studies according to various methodological approaches to investigate whether these systematically affected the reported findings. A total of 45 studies (69 contrasts, 594 foci) met our inclusion criteria. Significant ALE peaks for odor against baseline were observed in areas commonly labeled as primary and secondary olfactory cortex, such as the piriform and orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, anterior insula, and ventral putamen. In addition, differences were observed in the extent to which different methods were able to induce activation in these different nodes of the olfactory network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this regard, thermal loads increase tensile residual stress and heat-affected zone; however, mechanical loads increase fatigue strength and compressive residual stress on the machined workpiece during the process. Since experimental investigation is difficult, the problem becomes more difficult if the aim is minimizing thermal loads, while maximizing mechanical loads during the hard turning process. This article presents a hybrid method based on the artificial neural networks, multiobjective optimization, and finite element analysis for evaluation of thermo-mechanical loads during the orthogonal turning of AISI H13-hardened die steel (52HRC). First, using an iterative procedure, controllable parameters of simulation (including contact conditions and flow stress) are determined by comparison between finite element and experimental results from the literature. Then, the results of finite element simulation at the different cutting conditions and tool geometries were employed for training neural networks by genetic algorithm. Finally, the functions implemented by neural networks were considered as objective functions of nondominated genetic algorithm and optimal nondominated solution set were determined at the different states of thermal loads (workpiece temperature) and mechanical loads (workpiece effective strain). Comparison between the obtained results of nondominated genetic algorithm and predicted results of finite element simulation showed that the hybrid technique of finite element method-artificial neural networks-multiobjective optimization provides a robust framework for machining simulation of AISI H13.

A domain in the carboxy-terminus of TSPO was identified and characterized as the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC). The ability of the CRAC domain to bind to cholesterol led us to hypothesize that this peptide could be used as an hypocholesterolemic, with potential anti-atherogenic properties, agent. We report herein the therapeutic benefit that resulted for the administration of the VLNYYVWR human CRAC sequence to guinea pigs fed with a high cholesterol diet and ApoE knock-out B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J mice. CRAC treatment (3 and 30 mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks) resulted in reduced circulating cholesterol levels in guinea pigs fed with 2% high cholesterol diet and ApoE knock-out B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J mice. In high cholesterol fed guinea pigs, CRAC treatment administered once daily induced an increase in circulating HDL, decreased total, free and LDL cholesterol, and removed atheroma deposits in the aorta in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment also prevented the high cholesterol diet-induced increase in serum creatine kinase, total and isoforms, markers of neurological, cardiac and muscular damage. No toxicity was observed.

Downstream of netrin-1, activated Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 induce cytoskeletal rearrangements within the growth cone. The Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Trio is essential for Rac1 activation downstream of netrin-1/DCC, but the molecular mechanisms governing Trio activity remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Trio is phosphorylated by Src family kinases in the embryonic rat cortex in response to netrin-1. In vitro, Trio was predominantly phosphorylated at Tyr(2622) by the Src kinase Fyn. Though the phospho-null mutant Trio(Y2622F) retained GEF activity toward Rac1, its expression impaired netrin-1-induced Rac1 activation and DCC-mediated neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Trio(Y2622F) impaired netrin-1-induced axonal extension in cultured cortical neurons and was unable to colocalize with DCC in growth cones, in contrast to wild-type Trio. Furthermore, depletion of Trio in cortical neurons reduced the level of cell surface DCC in growth cones, which could be restored by expression of wild-type Trio but not Trio(Y2622F). Together, these findings demonstrate that Trio(Y2622) phosphorylation is essential for the regulation of the DCC/Trio signaling complex in cortical neurons during netrin-1-mediated axon outgrowth.

The enhanced perceptual functioning model (Mottron et al., 2006a) emphasizes the increased role and autonomy of perceptual information processing in autistic cognition. Autistic abilities also involve enhanced pattern detection, which may develop through veridical mapping across isomorphic perceptual and non-perceptual structures (Mottron et al., 2009). In this paper, we elaborate veridical mapping as a specific mechanism which can explain the higher incidence of savant abilities, as well as other related phenomena, in autism. We contend that savant abilities such as hyperlexia, but also absolute pitch and synaesthesia, involve similar neurocognitive components, share the same structure and developmental course, and represent related ways by which the perceptual brain deals with objective structures under different conditions. Plausibly, these apparently different phenomena develop through a veridical mapping mechanism whereby perceptual information is coupled with homological data drawn from within or across isomorphic structures. The atypical neural connectivity characteristic of autism is consistent with a developmental predisposition to veridical mapping and the resulting high prevalence of savant abilities, absolute pitch, and synaesthesia in autism.

Whereas controlled processes are slow and effortful, automatic processes are fast and involuntary. Over the past decade, we have propelled a research trajectory investigating how top-down influence in the form of suggestion can allow individuals to modulate the automaticity of cognitive processes. Here we present an overarching array of converging findings that collectively indicate that certain individuals can derail involuntary processes, such as reading, by "unringing" the proverbial bell. We examine replications of these effects from both our own laboratory and independent groups, and extend our Stroop findings to several other well-established automatic paradigms, including the McGurk effect. We thus demonstrate how, in the case of highly suggestible individuals, suggestion seems to wield control over a process that is likely even more automatic than the Stroop effect. Finally, we present findings from two novel experimental paradigms exploring the potential of shifting automaticity in the opposite direction - i.e., transforming, without practice, a controlled task into one that is automatic. Drawing on related evidence from the neuroscience of contemplative practices, we discuss how these findings pave the road to a more scientific understanding of voluntary control and automaticity, and expound on their possible experimental and therapeutic applications.

However, the ability of health professionals and researchers to accurately predict the outcome of pediatric TBI remains limited. The advent of advanced neuroimaging techniques shows some promise in improving outcome prediction, as they contribute to greater sensitivity in characterizing intracranial lesions underlying many cognitive and functional deficits. In this study, the relationship between lesions identified on susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and cognitive and functional outcomes was investigated following childhood TBI. Method: Participants between 5 and 14 years of age with varying levels of TBI severity (mild, mild complicated, moderate, severe, n = 106) underwent susceptibility weighted scanning on average 1-month post-injury and completed an assessment of intellectual functioning, processing speed, and behavioral and adaptive skills 6-month post-injury. Results: More severe TBI was generally associated with poorer intellectual functioning, greater behavioral problems and lower adaptive functioning. Number and volume of SWI lesions were significantly correlated with clinical outcome variables including Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), surgical intervention, length of hospital stay and length of intubation, as well as with intellectual functioning. Together, SWI and GCS accounted for a significant, though small, proportion of the variance in intellectual quotient (IQ). Conclusions: SWI is a sensitive technique for detecting brain lesions at all TBI severity levels and shows promise in contributing to prediction of cognitive outcomes in the initial stages post-injury.

In either case, specific TRP isoforms participate in chains of pro-or anti-inflammatory signaling cascades often including activation of transcription factors, protein kinases and phospholipases, which result in signal integration or amplification. In a few cases, their potentials as therapeutic targets for inflammatory conditions like pruritis, cystitis, dermatitis, asthma among other conditions are investigated pre-clinically or clinically by pioneering academic groups and industries. Significant efforts are still devoted to the understanding of the detailed physiological roles played by TRP channels during inflammation. This review intends to summarize key biological findings and reports of drug discovery activities when available, in an overview of the current status and recent developments in the field.

Methods We studied adolescents (n = 571; aged 12-18 years) participating in the Saguenay Youth Study; half of the participants were exposed to maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy. Hierarchical linear modelling was used to assess whether breastfeeding is an important predictor of cortical thickness when other predictors, such as age, sex, parental education and exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, are also considered. Target cortical regions were identified using a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of cognitive abilities relevant for general intelligence. Results We found that duration of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with cortical thickness in the superior and inferior parietal lobules (t = 2.31, P = 0.02). We also replicated the association between breastfeeding and general intelligence (t = 2.69, P = 0.008). Conclusion In this study, we showed that breastfeeding is associated with variations in the thickness of the parietal cortex in a community-based sample of adolescents. We also found association of breastfeeding duration with full scale and performance IQ, as observed previously.

A new paradigm emerges from the study of de novo mutations in the context of neurodevelopmental disease	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						de novo mutation; exome sequencing; Mendelian disorders; next-generation sequencing; neurodevelopmental disease	COPY-NUMBER VARIATION; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; CAUSE GENITOPATELLAR SYNDROME; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; HUMAN INHERITED DISEASE; COFFIN-SIRIS SYNDROME; MENTAL-RETARDATION; RETT-SYNDROME; EXOME CAPTURE; HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE	The study of de novo point mutations (new germline mutations arising from the gametes of the parents) remained largely static until the arrival of next-generation sequencing technologies, which made both whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) feasible in practical terms. Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays have been used to identify de novo copy-number variants in a number of common neurodevelopmental conditions such as schizophrenia and autism. By contrast, as point mutations and microlesions occurring de novo are refractory to analysis by these microarray-based methods, little was known about either their frequency or impact upon neurodevelopmental disease, until the advent of WES. De novo point mutations have recently been implicated in schizophrenia, autism and mental retardation through the WES of case-parent trios. Taken together, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that the occurrence of de novo mutations could account for the high prevalence of such diseases that are associated with a marked reduction in fecundity. De novo point mutations are also known to be responsible for many sporadic cases of rare dominant Mendelian disorders such as Kabuki syndrome, Schinzel-Giedion syndrome and Bohring-Opitz syndrome. These disorders share a common feature in that they are all characterized by intellectual disability. In summary, recent WES studies of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disease have provided new insights into the role of de novo mutations in these disorders. Our knowledge of de novo mutations is likely to be further accelerated by WGS. However, the collection of case-parent trios will be a prerequisite for such studies. This review aims to discuss recent developments in the study of de novo mutations made possible by technological advances in DNA sequencing.

First, it promotes recovery of monocular vision but because it is not designed to promote binocularity, its binocular outcomes often are disappointing. Second, compliance is poor and variable. Third, the effectiveness of the treatment is thought to decrease with increasing age. We discuss 2 new approaches aimed at recovering visual function in adults with amblyopia. The first is a binocular approach to amblyopia treatment that is showing promise in initial clinical studies. The second is still in development and involves the use of well-established noninvasive brain stimulation techniques to temporarily alter the balance of excitation and inhibition in the visual cortex.

Parkinson's disease duration determines effect of dopaminergic therapy on ventral striatum function	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; cognition; striatum; dopamine; basal ganglia	L-DOPA; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; BASAL GANGLIA; MEDICATION; MECHANISMS; LEVODOPA; MODULATION; DEFICITS; REWARD	We investigated the hypothesis that variation in endogenous dopamine (DA) across brain regions explains dissimilar effects of dopaminergic therapy on aspects of cognition in early Parkinson's disease (PD). Extensive degeneration of DA-producing cells in the substantia nigra cause dorsal striatum (DS) DA deficiency and movement abnormalities. Particularly in early PD, this contrasts with relative sparing of the dopaminergic cells of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The hypothesis predicts that DS-mediated cognitive functions are deficient at baseline and improved by DA replacement, whereas functions depending upon VTA-innervated brain regions are normal off medication and worsen with treatment. The latter pattern presumably owes to overdose of relatively DA-replete VTA-supplied brain regions with medication levels titrated to DS-mediated motor symptoms. As PD progresses, however, VTA degeneration increases. Impairment in cognitive operations performed by VTA-innervated brain regions, such as the ventral striatum (VS), is expected. We compared the performance of early and late PD patients, on and off dopaminergic medication, relative to age-matched controls, on reward learning, previously shown to implicate the VS. As expected, in early PD, stimulus-reward learning was normal off medication, but worsened with DA replacement. At more advanced disease stages, PD patients learned stimulus-reward contingencies more poorly than controls and early PD patients off medication. Furthermore, dopaminergic medication did not worsen reward learning in late PD patients, in line with the dopamine overdose hypothesis. Unlike its effect on DS-mediated functions, however, DA-replacement therapy did not improve reward learning in late PD patients.

In this review, we summarize the literature to investigate how a mere sequence of sound events can become so pleasurable. We examine the role of the brain's mesolimbic reward and reinforcement circuitry in processing of rewards, and how the connectivity of this system has become more integrated with higher-order brain regions involved in complex thought to give rise to abstract pleasures. We suggest an integrative role for complex cortical processes with long-existing reinforcement circuits and an interaction between sensory processing and decoding mechanisms and affective processing.

Previous evidence has shown that neurophysiological impairment signs occurred under microgravity. The present study was undertaken to explore the change in protein abundance in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells that were grown in a microgravity environment. The comparative proteomic method based on the O-18 labeling technique was applied to investigate the up-regulated proteins and down-regulated proteins in SH-SY5Y under simulated microgravity. Twenty-two differentially abundant proteins were quantified in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The cell microfilament network was disrupted under simulated microgravity, which was determined by the immunocytochemistry. The concentration of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and free Ca2+ ion significantly increased, and the level of ATP significantly decreased under simulated microgravity. However, there was no obvious cell apoptosis observed under simulated microgravity. These results provide new molecular evidence for the change in protein abundance in SH-SY5Y cells under simulated microgravity, which might unfold biological mechanisms and the development of effective countermeasures to deal with microgravity-related neurological problems. We believe that the state-of-the-art proteomic assay may be a means by which aerospace scientists will begin to understand the underlying mechanisms of space life activities at the protein level.

Interestingly, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with behavioural deficits, hypo-activation and cortical thinning of similar networks. This study assessed the relationship between prior meditative training, attentional absorption, and cortical thickness. Grey matter thickness was measured in 18 meditators and 18 controls. Subjective reports of attentional absorption were modestly higher in meditators and across the entire sample correlated positively with cortical thickness in several regions corresponding to cingulo-fronto-parietal attention networks. Within these regions the meditation group had greater cortical thickness which was positively related to the extent of prior training. Evidence suggesting that meditative practice activates these cortical areas, improves attention and may ameliorate symptoms of ADHD by targeting vulnerable brain regions is discussed.

Method: The Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) is a newly developed, reliable parent/caregiver-report tool, which combines assessment of children's participation and the environment. The PEM-CY was completed online by 576 parents of children or youth (5 to 17 years old) with and without disabilities from Canada and the United States. ANOVA analyses were performed to examine group differences in PEM-CY summary scores. Item-level differences are presented descriptively using radar plots. Results: After controlling for age and income, significant differences between children with and without disabilities were observed for all home-based PEM-CY participation and environment summary scores. Differences between the two groups were also evident at the item level, particularly when comparing the percentage of children and youth who never participate in specific home-based activities and when comparing perceived barriers to participation. Conclusion: Although all children and youth participate frequently in home-based activities, those with disabilities tend to participate in less complex and quieter/sedentary activities. This, in addition to parental report of environmental barriers to participation, highlights the potential importance of home-based occupational therapy intervention to optimise participation in this setting.

Substance P decreases fat storage and increases adipocytokine production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 304: G420-G427, 2013. First published December 20, 2012; doi: 10.1152/ajpgi.00162.2012.-Obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance are closely linked. Substance P (SP), via its neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), mediates inflammatory and, possibly, neuroendocrine processes. We examined SP effects on lipid storage and cytokine production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and adipose tissues. 3T3-L1 adipocytes and preadipocytes express NK1R, and 8 days of SP supplementation during differentiation to 3T3-L1 preadipocytes decreased lipid droplet accumulation. SP (10 nM, 24 h) increased lipolysis in primary adipocytes (138 +/- 7%, P < 0.05) and reduced fatty acid uptake (-31 +/- 7%, P < 0.05) and mRNA expression of the differentiation-related transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma type 2 (-64 +/- 2%, P < 0.001) and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (CEBP)-alpha (-65 +/- 2%, P < 0.001) and the lipid storage genes fatty acid-binding protein type 4 (-59 +/- 2%, P < 0.001) and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase-1 (-45 +/- 2%, P < 0.01) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, while CD36, a fatty acid transporter (-82 +/- 19%, P < 0.01), was augmented. SP increased secretion of complement C3 (148 +/- 15%, P < 0.04), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (156 +/- 16%, P < 0.03), and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (148 +/- 18%, P < 0.045) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (496 +/- 142%, P < 0.02) and complement C3 (152 +/- 25%, P < 0.04) in adipose tissue and primary adipocytes, respectively. These SP effects were accompanied by downregulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (-82 +/- 2%, P < 0.01) and GLUT4 (-76 +/- 2%, P < 0.01) mRNA expression, and SP acutely blocked insulin-mediated stimulation of fatty acid uptake and Akt phosphorylation. Although adiponectin secretion was unchanged, mRNA expression was decreased (-86 +/- 8%, P < 0.001). In humans, NK1R expression correlates positively with plasma insulin, fatty acid, and complement C3 and negatively with adiponectin, CEBP alpha, CEBP beta, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma mRNA expression in omental, but not subcutaneous, adipose tissue. Our results suggest that, beyond its neuroendocrine and inflammatory effects, SP could also be involved in targeting adipose tissue and influencing insulin resistance.

Stroke-specific executive function assessment: A literature review of performance-based tools	AUSTRALIAN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY JOURNAL			English	Review						assessment; ecological; executive function; stroke	ACQUIRED BRAIN-INJURY; MULTIPLE ERRANDS TEST; OUTCOMES FOLLOWING STROKE; ECOLOGICALLY VALID TEST; DYSEXECUTIVE SYNDROME; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS; VIRTUAL SUPERMARKET; SIMPLIFIED VERSION; FUNCTION DEFICITS	Background/aim Executive function should be an integral component of post-stroke assessment. However, a Canada-wide survey of occupational therapists on stroke rehabilitation practices found a rare use of executive function assessments. Performance-based executive function assessments that closely reflect real-world activities are useful in identifying individuals who will face difficulties when returning to home and community activities. To increase clinicians' awareness of these tools, a literature review was conducted to identify performance-based measures of executive function and their stroke-specific psychometric properties. Methods The review identified 17 performance-based tools and 41 studies that reported their psychometric properties specific to stroke. Each tool was critically appraised according to the executive function components assessed, the level of functioning assessed (i.e. impairment, activity or participation), the environment within which the assessment is conducted and the tool's psychometric properties and clinical utility. Standard criteria were used to evaluate the tools' psychometric properties. The findings were compiled in a Stroke-Specific Executive Function Toolkit. Results The assessments that demonstrated the strongest evidence of reliability and validity were the Executive Function Performance Test, the Multiple Errands Test and the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills. Only the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills has been adequately evaluated for its ability to detect change. In terms of clinical utility, the Kettle Test has the shortest administration time (i.e. less than 20minutes) and requires limited equipment. Conclusions and significance of the study The Stroke-Specific Executive Function Toolkit provides clinicians with useful information that should facilitate identification of appropriate executive function tools for use across the continuum of stroke care.

J	Abela, AR; Chudasama, Y				Abela, Andrew R.; Chudasama, Yogita			Dissociable contributions of the ventral hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex to decision-making with a delayed or uncertain outcome	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						impulsivity; prefrontal; risk; temporal lobe; touchscreens	ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS CORE; INTER-TEMPORAL CHOICE; ACID-INDUCED LESIONS; IMPULSIVE-CHOICE; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; PROBABILISTIC REINFORCEMENT; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; SEPTAL-LESIONS; WORKING MEMORY	In this study, we examined how risk and delay influence rats' decision-making, and the role of the ventral hippocampus (VHC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in the valuation of these two factors. We used a touchscreen testing method in which rats with VHC lesions, OFC lesions and sham control surgery made choices in two decision-making tasks. In the delay discounting task, rats chose between two visual stimuli, one of which indicated a small, immediate reward, and the other of which indicated a large, delayed reward. In the probability discounting task, two stimuli indicated, instead, a small, certain reward or a large, uncertain reward. The two lesion groups showed a double dissociation with respect to the two tasks. Rats with VHC lesions were intolerant of delay, and were strongly biased towards the small, immediate reward. However, the same rats were indistinguishable from sham controls in the probability discounting task. The opposite pattern was observed for rats with OFC lesions; they performed normally in the delay discounting task, but showed a reduced tolerance for uncertainty as compared with sham-operated controls. These data support the conclusion that the VHC and OFC contribute differentially to decision-making that involves delayed or uncertain outcomes. This provides a means for understanding the neural basis of a range of neurological and psychiatric patients who show impaired decision-making and executive dysfunction.

Bridging neuroscience and clinical psychology: cognitive behavioral and psychophysiological models in the evaluation and treatment of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome	NEUROPSYCHIATRY			English	Review							CHRONIC TIC DISORDER; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; NERVOUS-SYSTEM STIMULANTS; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; HABIT-REVERSAL; RESPONSE PREVENTION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; EXPLOSIVE OUTBURSTS; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS	Cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology have long been considered to be separate disciplines. However, the phenomenon of brain plasticity in the context of a psychological intervention highlights the mechanisms of brain compensation and requires linking both clinical cognition and cognitive psychophysiology. A quantifiable normalization of brain activity seems to be correlated with an improvement of the tic symptoms after cognitive behavioral therapy in patients with Gilles de la burette syndrome (GTS). This article presents broad outlines of the state of the current literature in the field of GTS. We present our clinical research model and methodology for the integration of cognitive neuroscience in the psychological evaluation and treatment of GTS to manage chronic tic symptoms.

Dynamic genetic linkage of intermediate blood pressure phenotypes during postural adaptations in a founder population. Physiol Genomics 45: 138-150, 2013. First published December 26, 2012; doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00037.2012.-Blood pressure (BP) is a dynamic phenotype that varies rapidly to adjust to changing environmental conditions. Standing upright is a recent evolutionary trait, and genetic factors that influence postural adaptations may contribute to BP variability. We studied the effect of posture on the genetics of BP and intermediate BP phenotypes. We included 384 sib-pairs in 64 sib-ships from families ascertained by early-onset hypertension and dyslipidemia. Blood pressure, three hemodynamic and seven neuroendocrine intermediate BP phenotypes were measured with subjects lying supine and standing upright. The effect of posture on estimates of heritability and genetic covariance was investigated in full pedigrees. Linkage was conducted on 196 candidate genes by sib-pair analyses, and empirical estimates of significance were obtained. A permutation algorithm was implemented to study the postural effect on linkage. ADRA1A, APO, CAST, CORIN, CRHR1, EDNRB, FGF2, GC, GJA1, KCNB2, MMP3, NPY, NR3C2, PLN, TGFBR2, TNFRSF6, and TRHR showed evidence of linkage with any phenotype in the supine position and not upon standing, whereas AKR1B1, CD36, EDNRA, F5, MMP9, PKD2, PON1, PPARG, PPARGC1A, PRKCA, and RET were specifically linked to standing phenotypes. Genetic profiling was undertaken to show genetic interactions among intermediate BP phenotypes and genes specific to each posture. When investigators perform genetic studies exclusively on a single posture, important genetic components of BP are missed. Supine and standing BPs have distinct genetic signatures. Standardized maneuvers influence the results of genetic investigations into BP, thus reflecting its dynamic regulation.	[Arenas, I.

Design: Cross-sectional, descriptive, and exploratory study. Setting: Parents from the United States and Canada completed the main outcome measure online in their homes or communities. Participants: Parents (N= 576) reported on their children aged 5 to 17 years with disabilities (n=282) and without disabilities (n=294). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth. Results: Group differences in summary scores and many items were significant (P<.001). Children with disabilities participated less frequently, were less involved, and had less environmental support in the community than children without disabilities. Parents of children with disabilities desired more change in their child's participation than parents of children without disabilities. Effect sizes for summary scores were moderate to very large (n(2)p from .11-.40), with the largest group difference found in environment scores. Overall, the largest group differences in participation were in "unstructured physical activities" and "getting together with other children" also the 2 areas where parents of children with disabilities most frequently desired change. The largest differences in environmental impact were in physical, social, and cognitive activity demands and availability/adequacy of programs and services. Conclusions: Results provide insights about where greater efforts are needed to support community participation of school-age children with disabilities. Further study with a more diverse sample in terms of race/ethnicity, family income/education levels, and geographic region is needed to determine the extent to which results may be generalized.

Research design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods and procedure: A total of 2127 inpatients with MTBI were included. Outcomes measured were Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), the FIM (R) instrument, length of stay (LOS) and discharge destination. Main outcomes and results: Fifty-four per cent of patients with MTBI with a median GOS-E of 2 were discharged home with no need for further follow-up. Age, LOS, lower Glasgow score (GCS) at admission, insurance coverage and positive CT scans were associated with rehabilitation referrals on discharge. Age, LOS, alcohol and drug abuse, motor vehicle collision and lower GCS at admission were associated with greater physical disabilities and functional impairment at discharge. FIM (R) cognitive functional scores were higher in women, younger patients and patients without psychiatric disorders. Brain lesions were correlated with longer LOS. CT scan findings in patients with MTBI may help clinicians predict the final outcome and resources required for patient care during their hospitalization and on discharge. Conclusion: This study can help healthcare professionals in treating and planning future care of patients with MTBI.

(2011) [1] compared the performance of six different causality measures when the autoregressive process was estimated with the Dynamic Autoregressive Neuromagnetic Causal Imaging (DANCI) algorithm to help applied researchers in choosing the best method to estimate effective connectivity. This letter to the editor argues that four methodological restrictions limit the applicability of the results to actual applied research. First, there is no formal test for the significance of a connection between two channels. Second, the simulation results are affected by sizeable sampling variability. Third, only overestimation of the true model order is considered. Fourth, the comparison between methods always involves a joint hypothesis test. The letter discusses the limitations for applied researchers resulting from those restrictions and points to future research directions to overcome them. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This has been true for neuroprotection in the central nervous system, neuroprotection in glaucoma, as well as many other areas of medicine. Two fundamental reasons for this 'Lost in Translation' problem are the 'Butterfly Effect' (chaotic behavior of many animal models) and the Two Cultures' problem (differences between the methodologies for preclinical and clinical research). We propose several strategies to deal with these issues, including the use of ensembles of animal models, adding intraocular pressure lowering to preclinical neuroprotection studies, changing the way in which preclinical research is done, and increasing interactions between the preclinical and clinical teams.

Its pharmacological actions are straightforward, enhancing cholinergic activity both in the brain and systemically, with a long-enough half-life to allow for once a day dosing. Its efficacy has been approved for use in mild-to-moderate AD stage for improvement of symptoms for 10 years, and now it is also approved for use in severe stage. Areas covered: This review article will offer a 10-year perspective on the use of donepezil in clinical practice against AD and related disorders. In addition to discussing the information from randomized clinical trials and from the drug monograph, this article will seek to facilitate the clinical development and clinical use of the next generation of drugs for AD. Expert opinion: Adjustments about expectations and safe use of donepezil were made over time based on such clinical experiences. Offering a cholinesterase inhibitor to patients with mild-to-moderate AD clearly showed advantages. If well tolerated, donepezil should be continued in the severe stages of AD as long as the patient appears to benefit from a slower clinical decline.

We showed recently that motor learning leads to changes in the sensed position of the limb (Ostry DJ, Darainy M, Mattar AA, Wong J, Gribble PL. J Neurosci 30: 5384-5393, 2010). Here, we document further the links between motor learning and changes in somatosensory perception. To study motor learning, we used a force field paradigm in which subjects learn to compensate for forces applied to the hand by a robotic device. We used a task in which subjects judge lateral displacements of the hand to study somatosensory perception. In a first experiment, we divided the motor learning task into incremental phases and tracked sensory perception throughout. We found that changes in perception occurred at a slower rate than changes in motor performance. A second experiment tested whether awareness of the motor learning process is necessary for perceptual change. In this experiment, subjects were exposed to a force field that grew gradually in strength. We found that the shift in sensory perception occurred even when awareness of motor learning was reduced. These experiments argue for a link between motor learning and changes in somatosensory perception, and they are consistent with the idea that motor learning drives sensory change.	[Mattar, Andrew A.

The Impact of Semantic Dementia on Everyday Actions: Evidence from an Ecological Study	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Semantic memory disorders; Semantic dementia; Activities of daily living; Problem-solving; Frontal lobe	FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; OBJECT USE; ACTION DISORGANIZATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IADL PROFILE; KNOWLEDGE; MEMORY; BRAIN; SCRIPTS; REPRESENTATION	In theory, semantic memory may trigger and support the execution of everyday activities. This study explored this question by comparing three patients with semantic dementia to 40 normal controls performing different everyday activities. Participants were tested in their home using the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Profile, an ecological measure of everyday functioning. Participants were informed that they had unknowingly invited two guests for lunch and should prepare accordingly. With these instructions, they dress to go outdoors, go to the grocery store, shop for food, prepare a hot meal, have the meal with the guests, and clean up after the meal. Performance was analyzed on the basis of four operations related to problem solving: formulate a goal, plan, execute, and verify attainment of the goal. Results indicate that compared to normal controls, two patients had significant difficulties and needed assistance with all operations of problem-solving, particularly while preparing a meal and cleaning up after the meal. One patient showed no difficulties despite severe semantic deficits. These results suggest that semantic deficits alone cannot explain the difficulties observed, but may contribute to some aspects of everyday actions such as those involved in everyday problem-solving.

Factors Associated with the Withdrawal of Life-Sustaining Therapies in Patients with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Multicenter Cohort Study	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy; Mortality; Traumatic brain injury; Risk factors; End-of-life	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; MECHANICAL VENTILATION; NEW-ZEALAND; SUPPORT; MORTALITY; DOCUMENTATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MODELS; DEATH	To identify factors associated with decisions to withdraw life-sustaining therapies in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). We conducted a 2-year multicenter retrospective cohort study (2005-2006) in mechanically ventilated patients aged 16 years and older admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of six Canadian level I trauma centers following severe TBI. One hundred and twenty charts were randomly selected at each center (n = 720). Data on ICU management strategies, patients' clinical condition, surgical procedures, diagnostic imaging, and decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies were collected. The association of factors pertaining to the injury, interventions, and management strategies with decisions to withdraw life-sustaining therapies was evaluated among non-survivors. Among the 228 non-survivors, 160 died following withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. Patients were predominantly male (69.7 %) with a mean age of 50.7 (+/- 21.7) years old. Brain herniation was more often reported in patients who died following decisions to withdraw life-sustaining therapies (odds ratio [OR] 2.91, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.16-7.30, p = 0.02) compared to those who died due to other causes (e.g., cardiac arrest, shock, etc.). Epidural hematomas (OR 0.18, 95 % CI 0.06-0.56, p < 0.01), craniotomies (OR 0.12, 95 % CI 0.02-0.68, p = 0.02), and other non-neurosurgical procedures (OR 0.08, 95 % CI 0.02-0.43, p < 0.01) were less often associated with death following withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies than death from other causes. Death following decisions to withdraw life-sustaining therapies is associated with specific patient and clinical factors, and the intensity of care.

This study reports 9 cases referred to our institution after surgical correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and pedicle screws misplaced totally within the spinal canal. Objective. To assess the neurological outcome associated with pedicle screws misplaced totally within the spinal canal. Summary of Background Data. The prevalence of neurological complications from misplaced pedicle screws might be under-reported, and optimal management of pedicle screws misplaced totally Within the spinal canal remains unclear. Methods. Nine cases with pedicle screws misplaced totally within the spinal canal during posterior surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were reviewed. All cases presented at least 1 medially misplaced pedicle screw, with spinal canal intrusion greater than pedicle screw diameter, that is, completely within the spinal canal. Percentage of spinal canal intrusion was measured from computed tomographic scans. Results. Spinal canal intrusion varied from 21% to 61%. In 2 patients, misplacement of pedicle screws was recognized intraoperatively and all implants were removed. They both had motor deficits from which 1 patient recovered completely. Two patients had early postoperative. postural headache that disappeared after removal of the misplaced screw. Five patients had uneventful early postoperative course. One of these developed a Brown-Sequard syndrome 2 years after surgery and underwent complete implant removal. Another patient developed left thoracic paresthesia 3 years after surgery, and complete implant removal was performed. Two neurologically intact patients had uneventful implant removal after infection. The last patient refused implant removal and remained asymptomatic 5 years after surgery. Conclusion. Improper pedicle screw placement can lead to neurological complications appearing early or late (after 2 yr). Late neurological complications were associated with screw loosening in 2 cases. The authors strongly recommend removal of any pedicle screw misplaced totally within the spinal canal due to the risk of early or late neurological complications, regardless of the severity of spinal canal intrusion.

Safety and efficacy of weekly nab((R))-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin as first-line therapy in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer	ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						advanced NSCLC; elderly; first-line therapy; nab-paclitaxel	ALBUMIN-BOUND PACLITAXEL; PHASE-III TRIAL; NAB-PACLITAXEL; CHEMOTHERAPY; VINORELBINE; DOCETAXEL; NEUROPATHY; TRENDS	This analysis evaluates safety and efficacy in elderly (>= 70 years old) versus younger patients enrolled in a phase III advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trial. Untreated stage IIIB/IV patients with PS 0/1 were randomly assigned (1:1) to carboplatin AUC6, day 1 every 3 weeks, and either nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) 100 mg/m(2) weekly (nab-P/C) or solvent-based paclitaxel (Taxol) 200 mg/m(2) day 1 every 3 weeks (sb-P/C). The primary end-point was overall response rate (ORR). Fifteen percent of 1052 enrolled patients were elderly: nab-P/C, n = 74; sb-P/C, n = 82. In both age cohorts, the ORR was higher with nab-P/C versus sb-P/C (age >= 70: 34% versus 24%, P = 0.196; age < 70: 32% versus 25%, P = 0.013). In elderly patients, progression-free survival (PFS) trended in favor of nab-P/C (median 8.0 versus 6.8 months, hazard ratio (HR) 0.687, P = 0.134), and overall survival (OS) was significantly improved (median 19.9 versus 10.4 months, HR 0.583, P = 0.009). In younger patients, PFS (median 6.0 versus 5.8 months, HR 0.903, P = 0.256) and OS (median 11.4 versus 11.3 months, HR 0.999, P = 0.988) were similar in both arms. Adverse events were similar in both age groups, with less neutropenia (P = 0.015), neuropathy (P = 0.001), and arthralgia (P = 0.029), and increased anemia (P = 0.007) with nab-P/C versus sb-P/C. In elderly NSCLC patients, nab-P/C as first-line therapy was well tolerated and improved the ORR and PFS, with substantially longer OS versus sb-PC.	[Socinski, M.

Discovery of new antagonists aimed at discriminating UII and URP-mediated biological activities: insight into UII and URP receptor activation	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						urotensin II; urotensin II-related peptide; insurmountable antagonism; GPCR; human UT receptors; aortic ring bioassay	UROTENSIN-II-RECEPTOR; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; COLLAGEN-SYNTHESIS; ARRIVE GUIDELINES; DRUG DISCOVERY; RAT-BRAIN; PEPTIDE; POTENT	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Recent evidence suggested that urotensin II (UII) and its paralog peptide UII-related peptide (URP) might exert common but also divergent physiological actions. Unfortunately, none of the existing antagonists were designed to discriminate specific UII- or URP-associated actions, and our understanding, on how these two endogenous peptides can trigger different, but also common responses, is limited. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Ex vivo rat and monkey aortic ring contraction as well as dissociation kinetics studies using transfected CHO cells expressing the human urotensin (UT) receptors were used in this study. KEY RESULTS Ex vivo rat and monkey aortic ring contraction studies revealed the propensity of [Pep(4)]URP to decrease the maximal response of human UII (hUII) without any significant change in potency, whereas no effect was noticeable on the URP-induced vasoconstriction. Dissociation experiments demonstrated the ability of [Pep(4)]URP to increase the dissociation rate of hUII, but not URP. Surprisingly, URP, an equipotent UII paralog, was also able to accelerate the dissociation rate of membrane-bound I-125-hUII, whereas hUII had no noticeable effect on URP dissociation kinetics. Further experiments suggested that an interaction between the glutamic residue at position 1 of hUII and the UT receptor seems to be critical to induce conformational changes associated with agonistic activation. Finally, we demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of the rat UII isoform was able to act as a specific antagonist of the URP-associated actions. CONCLUSION Such compounds, that is [Pep(4)]URP and rUII(1-7), should prove to be useful as new pharmacological tools to decipher the specific role of UII and URP in vitro but also in vivo.

We examined the association of heart defects with four polymorphisms in folate-related genes (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) c.677C>T, MTHFR c.1298A>C, methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) c.66A>G, and reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1) c.80A>G) in a case-control study of children (156 patients, 69 controls) and mothers of children with heart defects (181 patients, 65 controls), born before folic acid fortification. MTRR c.66A>G in children modified odds ratios for overall heart defects, specifically ventricular septal defect and aortic valve stenosis (p-value below 0.05). The 66GG and AG genotypes were associated with decreased odds ratios for heart defects (0.42, 95% confidence interval (0.18-0.97) and 0.39 (0.18-0.84), respectively). This overall association was driven by decreased risk for ventricular septal defect for 66GG and AG (odds ratio 0.32 (0.11-0.91) and 0.25 (0.09-0.65)) and decreased odds ratio for aortic valve stenosis for 66AG (0.27 (0.09-0.79)). The association of ventricular septal defect and 66AG remained significant after correction for multiple testing (p=0.0044, multiple testing threshold p=0.0125). Maternal MTHFR 1298AC genotype was associated with increased odds ratio for aortic valve stenosis (2.90 (1.22-6.86), p=0.0157), but this association did not meet the higher multiple testing threshold. No association between MTHFR c.677C>T or SLC19A1 c.80A>G and heart defect risk was found. The influence of folate-related polymorphisms may be specific to certain types of heart defects; larger cohorts of mothers and children with distinct sub-classes are required to adequately address risk.

As tumor growth-induced bone remodeling progresses, episodes of severe pain and fractures of weight-bearing limbs increase. All of these skeletal-related events influence the patient's quality of life and survival. In the present study, we sought to determine whether some of these pain-related behaviors could be directly correlated to tumor progression and bone remodeling. For this purpose, we used a rat model of bone cancer pain based on the implantation of mammary carcinoma cells in the medullary cavity of the femur. The bone content and tumor growth were monitored over time by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micro X-ray computed tomography (mu CT). The same animals were evaluated for changes in their reflexive withdrawal responses to mechanical stimuli (allodynia) and weight-bearing deficits. As assessed by MRI, we found a negative correlation between tumor volume and allodynia or postural deficits throughout the experiment. Using mu CT, we found that the bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) ratios for trabecular and cortical bone correlated with both mechanical hypersensitivity and weight-bearing impairment. However, whereas trabecular BV/TV stabilized between days 7 and 10 post-tumor detection, the cortical bone loss reached its maximum at that time. Our imaging approach also allowed us to consistently detect the tumor before the onset of pain, paving the way for the preemptive identification of at-risk patients. Altogether, these results improve our understanding of the events leading to tumor-induced bone pain and could eventually help in the design of novel strategies for the management of bone diseases.

Such local inflammation contributes to the development of chronic neuropathic pain. Macrophages are one of the major players in the process of either or both degeneration/regeneration and hypersensitivity. To elucidate whether cellular and molecular changes involved in Wallerian degeneration are simultaneously involved in the induction and maintenance of neuropathic pain, and to identify which subpopulation of macrophages can be responsible for the chronic pain following nerve injury, we investigated the peripheral effects of an anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-beta 1 in neuropathic pain. Rat sciatic nerves were partially ligated. Macrophages accumulated in injured sciatic nerves displayed heterogeneity with two distinctive functional phenotypes. While MAC1(+) macrophages were able to express IL-6 and MIP-1 alpha, ED1(+) macrophages were always devoid of signals of inflammatory mediators. Intraneural injection of TGF-beta 1 resulted in delayed and attenuated neuropathic pain behaviour. In parallel, we observed that exposure of the nerve to TGF-beta 1 dramatically reduced the number of MAC1(+) macrophages. Consequently, the expression of IL-6 and MIP-1 alpha decreased in the injured nerve. Very interestingly, local TGF-beta 1 treatment had no effect on the population of ED1(+) phagocytic macrophages. In addition to its effect on selective subsets of macrophages, TGF-beta 1 also reduced T-lymphocyte infiltration. Our results revealed the critical roles of cytokine/chemokine secreting MAC1(+) macrophages in the development of neuropathic pain, and highlighted the needs and benefits of targeting specific populations of macrophages in alleviating neuropathic pain without delaying nerve regeneration.

Accordingly, increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, two inflammation-induced matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), may further aid the transformed cells either to infiltrate adjacent tissues or to enter the peripheral circulation. In the context of neuroinflammation, MMP-9 has been linked to processes such as blood-brain barrier opening and invasion of neural tissue by blood-derived immune cells. Given its reported anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, we investigated the in vitro pharmacological effects of lupeol, a diet-derived triterpenoid, on MMP-9 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expressions in a pediatric medulloblastoma DAOY cell line model. Lupeol was unable to inhibit the increased MMP-9 and COX-2 expression in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-treated cells, but was rather found to synergize with PMA to induce both biomarkers' expression. A contribution of the membrane type-1 (MT1)-MMP was also revealed, since lupeol/PMA treatments triggered proMMP-2 activation, and that MT1-MMP gene silencing reversed the combined effects of lupeol/PMA on both MMP-9 and COX-2. The mRNA stabilizing factor HuR was also found increased in the combined lupeol/PMA treatment, suggesting stabilization processes of the MMP-9 and COX-2 transcripts. We postulate that lupeol's anti-inflammatory properties may exert better pharmacological action within low MT1-MMP expressing tumors. Furthermore, these evidences add up to the new pleiotropic molecular mechanisms of action of MT1-MMP, and prompt for evaluating the future in vitro pharmacological properties of lupeol under pro-inflammatory experimental set-up.

The manager is an important player in the health care system, yet few studies have examined their role in knowledge transfer. The main objective was to explore the importance of knowledge transfer and improving practices from the viewpoint of managers of neurological rehabilitation programs. Methods An exploratory qualitative research design was used. Three case studies were conducted by way of semi-structured one-on-one interviews with neurological rehabilitation program managers. To be eligible, managers had to give their informed consent and have had responsibilities directly related to the coordination of clinicians working in neurological rehabilitation for at least a year. Data collected were recorded and transcribed. Each interview was synthesized and its content was carefully analysed. Results The three managers' experience in neurology varied from a year to several decades. They believe that knowledge transfer is important but it appears to be less of a priority because of their numerous other responsibilities. Participants said they perceived their role in this process as being a coach, facilitator, motivator, organizer, guide and ambassador. They mentioned reacting to the needs expressed by the clinicians but, when asked, said they would like to be more proactive and structured in their approach. Conclusions This study points up the lack of organizational structure fostering uniform knowledge translation across all clinicians, although the managers expect it to happen in the near future or would like to see it in an ideal world.

On the other hand, early trauma have/has been associated with poor mental health outcome in adulthood, in interaction with genetic factors, possibly through sustained alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis). Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of childhood trauma and its interaction with HPA-axis related genes on decision-making abilities in adulthood among a sample of suicide attempters. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was used to assess decision-making in 218 patients with a history of suicide attempt. Participant fulfilled the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire to report traumatic childhood experiences. Patients were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms within CRHR1 and CRHR2 genes. Patients with a history of sexual abuse had significantly lower IGT scores than non-sexually abused individuals. Polymorphisms within CRHR1 and CRHR2 genes interacted with both childhood sexual abuse and emotional neglect to influence IGT performance. In conclusion, childhood sexual abuse and emotional neglect may have long-term effects on decision-making through an interaction with key HPA axis genes. Even if these results need to be replicated in other sample, impaired decision-making may thus be the dimension through which child maltreatment, in interaction with HPA axis related genes, may have a sustained negative impact on adult mental health.

Abstract: The Transplantation Society, in collaboration with the Canadian Society of Transplantation, organized a forum on education on ODT for schools. The forum included participants from around the world, school boards, and representatives from different religions. Participants presented on their countries experience in the area of education on ODT. Working groups discussed about technologies for education, principles for sharing of resources globally, and relationships between education, and health authorities and non-governmental organizations. The forum concluded with a discussion about how to best help existing programs and those wishing to start educational programs on ODT.

Here we describe the occurrence of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and neurologic abnormalities in which hydroxocobalamin and folate therapy provided partial immune reconstitution. Whole exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous mutations in the MTHFD1 gene, which encodes a trifunctional protein essential for processing of single-carbon folate derivatives. We now report the immunologic details of this novel genetic cause of SCID and the response to targeted metabolic supplementation therapies. This finding expands the known metabolic causes of SCID and presents an important diagnostic consideration given the positive impact of therapy.

The role of dopaminergic transmission through D1-like and D2-like receptors in amphetamine-induced rat ultrasonic vocalizations	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Ultrasonic vocalization; Amphetamine; Dopamine; Noradrenaline; Atypical antipsychotic; Dose-response; D1 receptor; D2 receptor; Hedonia; Affect	CONDITIONED PLACE-PREFERENCE; DISCRIMINATIVE STIMULUS PROPERTIES; NOREPINEPHRINE REUPTAKE INHIBITOR; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; ADULT RATS; SCH 23390; ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; ANTAGONIST RACLOPRIDE	Systemic amphetamine (AMPH) administration increases the rate of 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in adult rats and preferentially enhances the 'trill' subtype; these effects of AMPH critically depend on noradrenergic transmission, but the possible contributions of dopamine are unclear. To assess the role of dopamine in 50-kHz USVs emitted drug-free and following systemic AMPH administration. Adult male Long-Evans rats pre-selected for high AMPH-induced calling rates were tested with AMPH (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (IP)) and saline following pretreatment with the following dopamine receptor antagonists: SCH 23390 (0.005-0.02 mg/kg, subcutaneous (SC)), SCH 39166 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg, SC), haloperidol (0.1, 0.2 mg/kg, IP), sulpiride (20-80 mg/kg, SC), raclopride (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, SC), clozapine (4 mg/kg, SC), risperidone (0.5 mg/kg, SC), and pimozide (1 mg/kg, IP). The dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (GBR 12909 and nisoxetine, respectively) were also tested, alone and in combination. SCH 23390, SCH 39166, haloperidol, and raclopride dose-dependently inhibited vocalizations under AMPH and suppressed the proportion of trill calls. Sulpiride, however, had no discernable effect on call rate or profile, even at a high dose that reduced locomotor activity. Single doses of clozapine, risperidone, and pimozide all markedly decreased calling under saline and AMPH. Finally, GBR 12909 and nisoxetine failed to promote 50-kHz USVs detectably or alter the subtype profile, when tested alone or in combination. The rate of 50-kHz USVs and the call subtype profile following systemic AMPH administration depends on dopaminergic neurotransmission through D1-like and D2-like receptors. However, inhibiting dopamine and/or noradrenaline reuptake appears insufficient to induce calling.	[Wright, Jennifer M.; Dobosiewicz, May R. S.; Clarke, Paul B.

Organelle biogenesis and maintenance requires newly synthesized proteins, each of which needs to go from the ribosome translating its mRNA to the correct membrane for insertion or translocation to an organellar subcompartment Decades of research have revealed how proteins are targeted to the correct organelle and translocated across one or more organelle membranes to the compartment where they function. The paradigm examples involve interactions between a peptide sequence in the protein, localization factors, and various membrane-embedded translocation machineries. Membrane translocation is either cotranslational or posttranslational depending on the protein and target organelle. Meanwhile, research in embryos, neurons and yeast revealed an alternative targeting mechanism in which the mRNA is localized and only then translated to synthesize the protein in the correct location. In these cases, the targeting information is encoded by cis-acting sequences in the mRNA ("Zipcodes") that interact with localization factors and, in many cases, are transported by molecular motors on cytoskeletal filaments. Recently, evidence has been found for this "mRNA-based" mechanism in organelle protein targeting to endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and the photosynthetic membranes within chloroplasts. Here we review known and potential roles of mRNA localization in protein targeting to and within organelles.

Genetic analysis of SIGMAR1 as a cause of familial ALS with dementia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; frontotemporal lobar degeneration; motor neuron disease; dementia	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; TARDBP MUTATIONS; CHROMOSOME 9P; LINKAGE; C9ORF72; TDP-43; LOCUS	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron diseases (MND), while frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of early-onset dementia. Many ALS families segregating FTLD have been reported, particularly over the last decade. Recently, mutations in TARDBP, FUS/TLS, and C90RF72 have been identified in both ALS and FTLD patients, while mutations in VCP, a FTLD associated gene, have been found in ALS families. Distinct variants located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the SIGMAR1 gene were previously reported in three unrelated FTLD or FTLD-MND families. We directly sequenced the coding and UTR regions of the SIGMAR1 gene in a targeted cohort of 25 individual familial ALS cases of Caucasian origin with a history of cognitive impairments. This screening identified one variant in the 3'-UTR of the SIGMAR1 gene in one ALS patient, but the same variant was also observed in 1 out of 380 control chromosomes. Subsequently, we screened the same samples for a C90RF72 repeat expansion: 52% of this cohort was found expanded, including the sample with the SIGMARI 3'-UTR variant. Consequently, coding and noncoding variants located in the 3'-UTR region of the SIGMAR1 gene are not the cause of FTLD-MND in our cohort, and more than half of this targeted cohort is genetically explained by C90RF72 repeat expansions.

Relationship between BDNF expression in major striatal afferents, striatum morphology and motor behavior in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease	GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Basal ganglia; cerebral cortex stereology; Huntington's mouse model; neurodegeneration; neurotrophin; striatum; thalamus	IMMUNOREACTIVE GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; PARAFASCICULAR THALAMIC NUCLEI; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; TRANSGENIC MICE; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; MESSENGER-RNA; CAG REPEAT; THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES; ANTEROGRADE TRANSPORT	Patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and transgenic mouse models of HD show neuronal loss in the striatum as a major feature, which contributes to cognitive and motor manifestations. Reduced expression of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in striatal afferents may play a role in neuronal loss. How progressive loss of BDNF expression in different cortical or subcortical afferents contributes to striatal atrophy and behavioral dysfunction in HD is not known, and may best be determined in animal models. We compared age-dependent alterations of BDNF mRNA expression in major striatal afferents from the cerebral cortex, thalamus and midbrain in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD. Corresponding changes in striatal morphology were quantified using unbiased stereology. Changes in motor behavior were measured using an open field, grip strength monitor, limb clasping and a rotarod apparatus. BDNF expression in cortical limbic and midbrain striatal afferents is reduced by age 4?weeks, prior to onset of motor abnormalities. BDNF expression in motor cortex and thalamic afferents is reduced by 6 weeks, coinciding with early motor dysfunction and reduced striatum volume. BDNF loss in afferents progresses until death at 1315?weeks, correlating with progressive striatal neuronal loss and motor abnormalities. Mutant huntingtin protein expression in R6/2 mice results in progressive loss of BDNF in both cortical and subcortical striatal afferents. BDNF loss in limbic and dopaminergic striatal inputs may contribute to cognitive/psychiatric dysfunction in HD. Subsequent BDNF loss in cortical motor and thalamic afferents may accelerate striatal degeneration, resulting in progressive involuntary movements.	[Samadi, P.; Boutet, A.; Rymar, V.

Hemizygous mutations in SNAP29 unmask autosomal recessive conditions and contribute to atypical findings in patients with 22q11.2DS	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article							OPITZ GBBB SYNDROME; BERNARD-SOULIER SYNDROME; DIGEORGE-SYNDROME; DELETION SYNDROME; KOUSSEFF-SYNDROME; REGION; IDENTIFICATION; PHENOTYPE; DEFECTS; GENES	Background 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is the most common microdeletion disorder, affecting an estimated 1 : 2000-4000 live births. Patients with 22q11.2DS have a broad spectrum of phenotypic abnormalities which generally includes congenital cardiac abnormalities, palatal anomalies, and immunodeficiency. Additional findings, such as skeletal anomalies and autoimmune disorders, can confer significant morbidity in a subset of patients. 22q11.2DS is a contiguous gene DS and over 40 genes are deleted in patients; thus deletion of several genes within this region contributes to the clinical features. Mutations outside or on the remaining 22q11.2 allele are also known to modify the phenotype. Methods We utilised whole exome, targeted exome and/or Sanger sequencing to examine the genome of 17 patients with 22q11.2 deletions and phenotypic features found in <10% of affected individuals. Results and conclusions In four unrelated patients, we identified three novel mutations in SNAP29, the gene implicated in the autosomal recessive condition cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis and keratoderma (CEDNIK). SNAP29 maps to 22q11.2 and encodes a soluble SNARE protein that is predicted to mediate vesicle fusion at the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi membranes. This work confirms that the phenotypic variability observed in a subset of patients with 22q11.2DS is due to mutations on the non-deleted chromosome, which leads to unmasking of autosomal recessive conditions such as CEDNIK, Kousseff, and a potentially autosomal recessive form of Opitz G/BBB syndrome. Furthermore, our work implicates SNAP29 as a major modifier of variable expressivity in 22q11.2 DS patients.

A 44-year-old, right-handed woman, presented for a volar swelling of her right hand. On examination she had a non-pulsatile mass with no fluctuation at the radiopalmar aspect of the right hand, and a soft mass on the volar aspect of the right palm. There was no pain on palpation. An excisional biopsy specimen showed an encapsulated and extrafascicular tumour that originated in the median nerve fascicules. Histological examination showed a median nerve schwannoma measuring 4.0 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm. Differential diagnosis of hand tumours is divided into three categories: tumours of the soft tissue, bone, and skin. Schwannomas of the median nerve make up 0.1%-0.3% of all hand tumours. Symptoms are caused by an entrapment syndrome resulting from the growing tumour. Pain is the most common complaint of schwannomas distal to the wrist. Imaging studies include computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is difficult to differentiate schwanommas from neurofibromas solely on the basis of an MRI. Neurofibroma grows intraneurally and infiltrates the nerve; it has the potential to require resection of all or part of the nerve, leaving a consequent functional deficit. Tumours of the hand are diagnostically challenging and median nerve shwannomas are rare.

After neuronal injury, that same type of touch can elicit unpleasant sensations: tactile allodynia. The prevailing pathophysiological explanation is a spinal cord sensitization, triggered by nerve injury, which enables Ab afferents to access pain pathways. However, a recent mouse knockout study demonstrates that C-tactile afferents are necessary for allodynia to develop, suggesting a role for not only Ab but also C-tactile afferent signaling. To examine the contribution of C-tactile afferents to the allodynic condition in humans, we applied the heat/capsaicin model of tactile allodynia in 43 healthy subjects and in 2 sensory neuronopathy patients lacking Ab afferents. Healthy subjects reported tactile-evoked pain, whereas the patients did not. Instead, patients reported their C-touch percept (faint sensation of pleasant touch) to be significantly weaker in the allodynic zone compared to untreated skin. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in 18 healthy subjects and in 1 scanned patient indicated that stroking in the allodynic and control zones evoked different responses in the primary cortical receiving area for thin fiber signaling, the posterior insular cortex. In addition, reduced activation in the medial prefrontal cortices, key areas for C-tactile hedonic processing, was identified. These findings suggest that dynamic tactile allodynia is associated with reduced C-tactile mediated hedonic touch processing. Nevertheless, because the patients did not develop allodynic pain, this seems dependent on Ab signaling, at least under these experimental conditions.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a pain mediator enriched in inflamed tissues, plays a pivotal role in nociceptor sensitization and in the genesis of inflammatory pain. Its EP4 receptor mainly mediates its role in inflammatory pain. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we found that PGE2/EP4 signalling-induced EP4 externalization in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contributes to nociceptor sensitization and inflammatory pain. In cultured DRG neurons, PGE2 and the EP4 agonist concentration- and time-dependently stimulated EP4 externalization. The inhibitors of anterograde secretory pathway, protein synthesis, or recycling pathway suppressed PGE2-induced EP4 externalization, suggesting that EP4 retained in Golgi apparatus and in recycling endosomes, as well as newly synthesized, are mobilized in this event. Interestingly, the intracellular cAMP levels of cultured DRG explants following 2 sequential treatments with the EP4 agonist were significantly higher than a single treatment, suggesting that the first treatment of agonist likely induces EP4 export to sensitize DRG neurons. Intraplantar injection of complete Freud's adjuvant increases both total and cell-surface EP4 levels of L4-6 DRG neurons, an event suppressed by a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor or a selective EP4 antagonist, suggesting that PGE2/EP4 signalling in inflamed paw contributes to EP4 synthesis and export in DRG neurons, thus sensitizing nociceptors during inflammation. We conclude that PGE2/EP4 signalling-induced EP4 externalization in DRG neuron is a novel mechanism underlying nociceptor sensitization and inflammatory pain. Blocking EP4 externalization could open a novel therapeutic avenue to treat inflammatory pain. (c) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Ten patients with schizophrenia were compared to 10 healthy controls, matched for age, sex, and educational level. Cognitive inhibition was examined by: 1) access to relevant information (Reading with distraction task), 2) suppression of no longer relevant information (Trail Making Test), and 3) restraint of cognitive resources to relevant information (Stroop Test, Hayling Sentence Completion Test, Go/No-Go Test). Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and Schizophrenia-Quality of Life scale (S-QoL) were also used. Results: Patients with schizophrenia showed a significant impairment in the suppression function of cognitive inhibition only, in comparison to the control group. Their access and restraint functions of cognitive inhibition were preserved. No relationship between quality of life and cognitive inhibition was found in patients with schizophrenia. Conclusions: During the stabilization phase of schizophrenia, the ability to inhibit neutral information access to working memory, and to restrain and suppress irrelevant information may not impair the patient's capacity to respond adequately to stressful situations, and thus would do not impact their quality of life.

In the present study, we investigated whether the activation of Rac1 was responsible for the neurite outgrowth triggered by staurosporine. Staurosporine caused rapid neurite outgrowth independent of the ERK signaling pathways. In contrast, neurite outgrowth in response to staurosporine was accompanied by activation of Rac1, and the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 attenuated the staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, suppression of Rac1 activity by expression of the dominant negative mutant Rac1N17 also blocked the staurosporine-induced morphological differentiation of PC12 cells. Staurosporine caused an activation of NADPH oxidase and increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was prevented by NSC23766 and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. Staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth was attenuated by pretreatment with DPI and exogenous addition of sublethal concentration of H2O2 accelerated neurite outgrowth triggered by staurosporine. These results indicate that activation of Rac1, which leads to ROS generation, is required for neurite outgrowth induced by staurosporine in PC12 cells.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition frequently requiring surgical intervention. We describe a new minimally invasive surgical technique for carpal tunnel release utilizing ultrasound (US) visualization. Methods. The technique was performed on 20 fresh frozen cadaver specimens. A surgical metallic probe with a U-shaped trough and upward curved distal tip was precisely positioned in the carpal tunnel with US guidance followed by division of the flexor retinaculum (FR) with a V-shaped scalpel. Results. Complete division of the FR was confirmed by US. Dissection performed on the specimens confirmed complete release of FR and absence of neurovascular injury. The distance from the division of the FR to these structures, the safety margins, was measured. Conclusions. This new technique for carpal tunnel release appears to combine the safety and efficacy of open carpal tunnel surgery with the advantages of the minimally invasive techniques.

JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS			English	Article							BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; CHILDREN; MOTOR; CLASSIFICATION; PATHOGENESIS; DEFINITION; INJURY; GENE; MAPS	Objective To identify distinctive clinical features characterizing children with cerebral palsy (CP) and normal-appearing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Study design Using a population-based CP registry, the Registre de la Paralysie Cerebrale au Quebec (Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry), various antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal predictor variables, as well as current phenotype, were compared in patients with normal-appearing MRI findings and those with abnormal MRI findings. Results Of the 213 patients evaluated, 126 (60%) had MRI imaging results available and were included in our analysis. Of these 126 patients, 90 (71%; 51 males, 39 females) had abnormal findings and 36 (29%; 17 males and 19 females) had normal-appearing findings. Compared with other CP variants, normal-appearing MRI was more prevalent (P = .001) in dyskinetic CP (72.7%; 8 of 11) and less prevalent (P = .002) in spastic hemiplegic CP (10%; 4 of 40). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups (P > .05) in terms of the prevalence of perinatal or postnatal clinical features or clinical outcomes. Furthermore, 42% (15 of 36) of the children with normal-appearing MRI exhibited a high degree of functional disability (Gross Motor Functional Classification System IV-V), compared with 33% (30 of 90) with abnormal MRI. Conclusion No clinical features, except a higher prevalence of dyskinetic CP, was identified in the children with normal-appearing MRI. More refined imaging techniques may be needed to evaluate patients with normal-appearing MRI findings. Furthermore, genetic or functional, rather than gross structural lesions, may underlie the pathophysiology of CP in this cohort. Finally, the high proportion of substantial functional disability underscores the importance of continuous follow-up even in the absence of early structural abnormalities on imaging.

It was previously reported that suppressing glycine signaling from the beginning of development in zebrafish embryos caused an abnormal maintenance of the progenitor population and a specific reduction of spinal interneurons but not of other cell populations. Here, we show that cells including progenitors in the embryonic spinal cord had occasional spontaneous, glycine-mediated calcium transients that were blocked by the glycine antagonist strychnine and the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine. As shown previously for chronic block by strychnine, block of these transients by nifedipine reduced interneuron differentiation. Our results indicate that glycinergic depolarization of neural progenitors evokes spontaneous calcium transients that may enhance the interneuron neurogenic program. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Pharmacological validation of early and late phase of rat mono-iodoacetate model using the Tekscan system	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIALS; OSTEOARTHRITIS PAIN; CHRONIC ARTHRITIS; WEIGHT-BEARING; RODENT MODELS; GAIT ANALYSIS; KNEE PAIN; INFLAMMATION; NOCICEPTORS; MODULATION	Background Previous pharmacological validations of the rat mono-iodoacetate (MIA)-induced chronic joint pain model were mostly performed by measuring weight-bearing (WB) deficit with an incapacitance tester. However, conventional incapacitance testers have several drawbacks including restrain stress on animal and sole use of hind limbs WB. Objectives The aim of the present study was to compare pharmacological sensitivity of the early (up to 1 week after MIA) versus late (between 2 and 4 weeks after MIA) phase of the rat MIA model using a highly sensitive tactile pressure measurement system (Tekscan (R)), which can measure weight borne by all four limbs and the tail in a non-restrained animal. Methods The Tekscan (R) WB measurement system was used in MIA rats to examine the acute and chronic dosing effects of drugs that targeted different mechanisms. Electrophysiological recordings from joint afferents and biochemical analysis of synovial fluid were also performed. Results Dexamethasone, duloxetine and morphine significantly alleviated WB deficits in the Tekscan (R) system during both early and late phase of the MIA model while celecoxib and naproxen alleviated WB deficit only during the early phase. Similarly, naproxen was able to inhibit spontaneous neuronal activity from MIA joint afferents only during the early phase. Finally, concentrations of prostaglandin E2 in synovial fluid were elevated only during the early phase of the rat MIA model. Conclusions Our pharmacological validation studies using the Tekscan (R) system along with electrophysiological and biochemical results suggest different mechanisms for early and late phase of MIA-induced chronic joint pain in rat.

This study investigates whether there are common structural cerebral correlates of trait impulsiveness and cognitive functioning in a large sample of healthy adolescents from the IMAGEN project. Methods: Clusters of gray matter (GM) volume associated with trait impulsiveness, Cloningers' revised temperament, and character inventory impulsiveness (TCI-R-I) were identified in a whole brain analysis using optimized voxel-based morphometry in 115 healthy 14-year-olds. The clusters were tested for correlations with performance on the nonverbal tests (Block Design, BD; Matrix Reasoning, MT) of the Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children IV reflecting perceptual reasoning. Results: Cloningers' impulsiveness (TCI-R-I) score was significantly inversely associated with GM volume in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Frontal clusters found were positively correlated with performance in perceptual reasoning tasks (Bonferroni corrected). No significant correlations between TCI-R-I and perceptual reasoning were observed. Conclusions: The neural correlate of trait impulsiveness in the OFC matches an area where brain function has previously been related to inhibitory control. Additionally, orbitofrontal GM volume was associated with scores for perceptual reasoning. The data show for the first time structural correlates of both cognitive functioning and impulsiveness in healthy adolescent subjects. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Repetition Suppression in Auditory-Motor Regions to Pitch and Temporal Structure in Music	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DORSAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; INTRAPARIETAL CORTEX; CORTICAL ACTIVATIONS; MENTAL ROTATION; PARIETAL CORTEX; BRAIN IMAGES; FMRI; AREAS; PERFORMANCE; RHYTHM	Music performance requires control of two sequential structures: the ordering of pitches and the temporal intervals between successive pitches. Whether pitch and temporal structures are processed as separate or integrated features remains unclear. A repetition suppression paradigm compared neural and behavioral correlates of mapping pitch sequences and temporal sequences to motor movements in music performance. Fourteen pianists listened to and performed novel melodies on an MR-compatible piano keyboard during fMRI scanning. The pitch or temporal patterns in the melodies either changed or repeated (remained the same) across consecutive trials. We expected decreased neural response to the patterns (pitch or temporal) that repeated across trials relative to patterns that changed. Pitch and temporal accuracy were high, and pitch accuracy improved when either pitch or temporal sequences repeated over trials. Repetition of either pitch or temporal sequences was associated with linear BOLD decrease in frontal-parietal brain regions including dorsal and ventral premotor cortex, pre-SMA, and superior parietal cortex. Pitch sequence repetition (in contrast to temporal sequence repetition) was associated with linear BOLD decrease in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) while pianists listened to melodies they were about to perform. Decreased BOLD response in IPS also predicted increase in pitch accuracy only when pitch sequences repeated. Thus, behavioral performance and neural response in sensorimotor mapping networks were sensitive to both pitch and temporal structure, suggesting that pitch and temporal structure are largely integrated in auditory-motor transformations. IPS may be involved in transforming pitch sequences into spatial coordinates for accurate piano performance.

In vitro and preliminary clinical studies have implied improved efficacy of I-125 relative to I-131 in certain clinical situations, although areas of uncertainty remain regarding intratumoral dosimetry. This prompted our study using human neuroblastoma multicellular spheroids as a model of metastasis. 3D dose calculations were made using voxel-based Medical Internal Radiation Dosimetry (MIRD) and dose-point-kernel (DPK) techniques. Dose distributions for I-131 and I-125 labeled mIBG were calculated for spheroids (metastases) of various sizes from 0.01 cm to 3 cm diameter, and the relative dose delivered to the tumors was compared for the same limiting dose to the bone marrow. Based on the same data, arguments were advanced based upon the principles of tumor control probability (TCP) to emphasize the potential theoretical utility of I-125 over I-131 in specific clinical situations. I-125-mIBG can deliver a higher and more uniform dose to tumors compared to I-131 mIBG without increasing the dose to the bone marrow. Depending on the tumor size and biological half-life, the relative dose to tumors of less than 1 mm diameter can increase several-fold. TCP calculations indicate that tumor control increases with increasing administered activity, and that I-125 is more effective than I-131 for tumor diameters of 0.01 cm or less. This study suggests that I-125-mIBG is dosimetrically superior to I-131-rnIBG therapy for small bone marrow metastases from neuroblastoma. It is logical to consider adding I-125-mIBG to I-131-mIBG in multi-modality therapy as these two isotopes could be complementary in terms of their cumulative dosimetry.	[Roa, Wilson H.

Jeff			High-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Accelerates and Enhances the Clinical Response to Antidepressants in Major Depression: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized, Double-Blind, and Sham-Controlled Trials	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MEDICATION-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ADD-ON RTMS; YOUNG-PATIENTS; ELECTROCONVULSIVE-THERAPY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; FOLLOW-UP	Objective: High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) is a safe and effective treatment for major depression. However, its utility as a strategy to accelerate and improve clinical response to antidepressants is still unclear. Data Sources: We searched the literature from 1995 through May 2012 using EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and, from October 2008 until May 2012, by using MEDLINE. We included only studies written in the English language. Study Selection: We selected all randomized, double-blind, and sham-controlled trials on HF-rTMS used as an accelerating (add-on) strategy to antidepressants for major depression. Data Extraction: We performed a random effects meta-analysis using odds ratios (ORs) for response and remission rates following HF-rTMS and sham rTMS. Two time points were considered: the end of the add-on HF-rTMS stimulation period (T-1) and the end of the study (T-2). Results: Data were obtained from 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), totaling 392 subjects with major depression. For T-1 (at mean +/- SD 2.67 +/- 0.82 weeks following start of combined rTMS + antidepressant treatment), 6 studies reported on response and 4 on remission rates. We found significantly higher response rates for active HF-rTMS (43.3%; 84/194) compared to sham rTMS (26.8%; 53/198) (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.12-5.56; P = .025); however, remission rates did not differ between groups (P = .33). Heterogeneity between the included RCTs reporting data on response and remission rates at T-1 was significant (response: Q(5) = 11.4, P = .044, I-2 = 56.12; remission: Q(3) = 12.24, P = .007, I-2 = 75.45). For study end (T-2; at mean +/- SD 6.80 +/- 3.11 weeks following start of combined rTMS + antidepressant treatment), 5 studies reported on response and 4 on remission rates; overall, response rates at T-2 were significantly higher for subjects receiving HF-rTMS in comparison to those receiving sham rTMS (62% [104/168] and 46% [79/172], respectively; OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.003-3.56; P = .049). Also, 53.8% (57/106) and 38.64% (36/107) of subjects receiving active HF-rTMS and sham rTMS, respectively, were in remission at T-2 (OR = 2.42; 95% CI, 1.27-4.61; P = .007). Heterogeneity between the included RCTs reporting data on remission rates at T-2 was not significant, although RCTs reporting on response rates at T-2 were heterogeneous. The baseline depression scores for active and sham rTMS groups were similar. Finally, HF-rTMS was comparable to sham rTMS in terms of dropout rates. Conclusions: HF-rTMS is a promising strategy for accelerating clinical response to antidepressants in major depression, providing clinically meaningful benefits that are comparable to those of other agents such as triiodothyronine and pindolol. Furthermore, HF-rTMS seems to be an acceptable treatment for depressed subjects. (C) Copyright 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

Sexual Orientation and Disclosure in Relation to Psychiatric Symptoms, Diurnal Cortisol, and Allostatic Load	PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE			English	Article						sexual minority stress; disclosure; allostatic load; diurnal cortisol; mental health; sexual orientation; stigma	MENTAL-HEALTH; GAY MEN; PHYSIOLOGICAL DYSREGULATION; BISEXUAL POPULATIONS; UNITED-STATES; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; HOMOSEXUAL IDENTITY; MINORITY STRESS; HIV-INFECTION; RISK	Objectives: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals-particularly those who have not disclosed their sexual orientation-are believed to experience increased chronic stress in comparison with heterosexuals. This interdisciplinary study assessed whether psychiatric symptoms (self-rated anxiety, depression, and burnout), stress hormone profiles (diurnal cortisol), and physiological dysregulations (allostatic load [AL]) would differ for a) LGBs versus heterosexuals and b) disclosed LGBs versus nondisclosed LGBs. Methods: The study included 87 healthy participants (mean [SD] age = 24.6 [0.6] years; LGB n = 46, 43% women; and heterosexual n = 41, 49% women). Diurnal cortisol sampled at five time points was averaged for 2 days. AL indices were based on an algorithm incorporating 21 biomarkers representing neuroendocrine, immune/inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular functioning. Psychological measures were assessed with well-validated questionnaires. Results: Between-group results revealed no significant differences in symptoms of anxiety and burnout, nor among diurnal cortisol levels between sexual orientations. By contrast, gay/bisexual men unexpectedly had lower depressive symptoms (p = .003) and AL levels (p = .043) compared with heterosexual men. Within-group results revealed that disclosed LGBs had fewer psychiatric symptoms (p values < 0.01) and lower cortisol levels +30 minutes upon awakening (p = .004) compared with nondisclosed LGBs. Disclosure was not significantly related to AL levels. Conclusions: LGBs did not manifest more stress-related problems than did heterosexuals.

In this article, we scrutinize the problem of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the tensor normal distribution of order 3 or more, which is characterized by the separability of its variance-covariance structure; there is one variance-covariance matrix per dimension. In the 3-D case, the system of likelihood equations for the three variance-covariance matrices has no analytical solution, and therefore needs to be solved iteratively. We studied the convergence of an iterative three-stage algorithm (MLE-3D) that we propose for this, determined the minimum sample size required for matrix estimates to exist, and computed by simulation the empirical bias and dispersion of the Kronecker product of the three variance-covariance matrix estimators in eight scenarios. We found that the standardized bias and a matrix measure of dispersion decrease monotonically and tend to vanish with increasing sample size, so the Kronecker product estimator is consistent. An example with 3-D spatial measures of glucose content in the brain is also presented. Finally, results are discussed and the 4-D case is presented with simulation results in an appendix.

Brain aging in specific cortical regions could affect the neural networks underlying spindle generation, yet the topography of these age-related changes is currently unknown. In the present study, we analyzed spindle characteristics in 114 healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 73 years over 5 anteroposterior electroencephalography scalp derivations. Spindle density, amplitude, and duration were higher in young subjects than in middle-aged and elderly subjects in all derivations, but the topography of age effects differed drastically. Age-related decline in density and amplitude was more prominent in anterior derivations, whereas duration showed a posterior prominence. Age groups did not differ in all-night spindle frequency for any derivation. These results show that age-related changes in sleep spindles follow distinct topographical patterns that are specific to each spindle characteristic. This topographical specificity may provide a useful biomarker to localize age-sensitive changes in underlying neural systems during normal and pathological aging. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Binding processes combine different contextual elements into a complete memory representation. It has been proposed that binding errors during the encoding process are responsible for the episodic memory impairments reported in schizophrenia. Since the hippocampus is critical for contextual binding and episodic memory, it was hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would show a deficit in information processing in the hippocampus, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the current experiment, 21 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy control participants were scanned while being tested on navigating in a virtual town (i.e. find the grocery store from the school), a task that was shown to be critically dependent on the hippocampus. Between-group comparisons revealed significantly less activation among patients relative to controls in the left middle frontal gyrus, and right and left hippocampi. We propose that the context and the content are not appropriately linked, therefore affecting the formation of a cognitive map representation in the patient group and eliciting a contextual binding deficit.

Besting Vitamin E: Sidechain Substitution is Key to the Reactivity of Naphthyridinol Antioxidants in Lipid Bilayers	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LOW-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; TOCOPHEROL TRANSFER PROTEIN; ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL; BREAKING ANTIOXIDANTS; AQUEOUS DISPERSIONS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; POLYUNSATURATED LIPIDS; PHENOLIC ANTIOXIDANTS; OMEGA-HYDROXYLASE	A series of naphthyridinol analogs of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TOH, right) with varying sidechain substitution was synthesized to determine how systematic changes in the lipophilicity of these potent antioxidants impact their radical-trapping activities in lipid bilayers, regenerability by water-soluble reductants, and binding to human tocopherol transport protein (TTP). The activities of the naphthyridinols were assayed in phosphatidylcholine unilamellar liposomes using a recently developed high-throughput assay that employs a boron dipyrromethene conjugate of alpha-TOH (H2B-PMHC) that undergoes fluorescence enhancement upon oxidation. The naphthyridinols afforded a dose-dependent protection of H2B-PMHC consistent with unprecedented peroxyl radical-trapping activity in lipid bilayers. While sidechain length and/or branching had no effect on their apparent reactivity, it dramatically impacted reaction stoichiometry, with more lipophilic compounds trapping two peroxyl radicals and more hydrophilic compounds trapping significantly less than one. It is suggested that the less lipophilic compounds autoxidize rapidly in the aqueous phase and that preferential partitioning of the more lipophilic compounds to the bilayer protects them from autoxidation. The cooperativity of a lipophilic naphthyridinol with water-soluble reducing agents was also studied in liposomes using H2B-PMHC and revealed superior regenerability by each of ascorbate, N-acetylcysteine, and urate when compared to alpha-TOH. Binding assays with human TTP, a key determinant of the bioavailability of the tocopherols, reveal that the naphthyiridinols can be very good ligands for the protein. In fact, naphthyridinols with sidechains of eight or more carbons had affinities for TTP which were similar to, and in one case alpha-fold better than, alpha-TOH.

The proapoptotic activity of p53 is tightly regulated by the apoptosis-stimulating proteins of p53 (ASPP) family members: ASPP1 and ASPP2. However, whether ASPP1/2 play a role in the regulation of p53-dependent neuronal death in the CNS is currently unknown. To address this, we asked whether ASPP1/2 contribute to the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) using in vivo models of acute optic nerve damage in mice and rats. Here, we show that p53 is activated in RGCs soon after injury and that axotomy-induced RGC death is attenuated in p53 heterozygote and null mice. We demonstrate that ASPP1/2 proteins are abundantly expressed by injured RGCs, and that short interfering (si)RNA-based ASPP1 or ASPP2 knockdown promotes robust RGC survival. Comparative gene expression analysis revealed that siASPP-mediated downregulation of p53-upregulated-modulator-of-apoptosis (PUMA), Fas/CD95, and Noxa depends on p53 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, siRNA against PUMA or Fas/CD95 confers neuroprotection, demonstrating a functional role for these p53 targets in RGC death. Our study demonstrates a novel role for ASPP1 and ASPP2 in the death of RGCs and provides evidence that blockade of the ASPP-p53 pathway is beneficial for central neuron survival after axonal injury.

This has been observed in neuroimaging and event-related potential studies centered in particular on midcingulate cortex (MCC) functions. This region of the brain is characterized by considerable intersubject morphological variability. Whereas in a subset of hemispheres only a single cingulate sulcus (cgs) is present, a majority of hemispheres exhibit an additional sulcus referred to as the paracingulate sulcus (pcgs). The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study defined the relationship between the local morphology of the cingulate/paracingulate sulcal complex and feedback-related activity. Human subjects performed a trial-and-error learning task in which they had to discover which one of a set of abstract stimuli was the best option. Feedback was provided by means of fruit juice, as in studies with monkeys. A subject-by-subject analysis revealed that the feedback-related activity during exploration was systematically located in the cgs when no pcgs was observed, but in the pcgs when the latter sulcus was present. The activations had the same functional signature when located in either the cgs or in the pcgs, confirming that both regions were homologues. Together, the results show that the location of feedback-related MCC activity can be predicted from morphological features of the cingulate/paracingulate complex.

Recently, a link between ADHD and body weight dysregulation has been reported and often interpreted as impaired self-regulation that is shared between the two conditions. The objective of this study is to investigate the relation between body weight/BMI and cognitive, emotional and motor characteristics in children with ADHD. Methods: 284 ADHD children were stratified by weight status/BMI according to WHO classification and compared with regard to their neurocognitive characteristics, motivational style, and motor profile as assessed by a comprehensive battery of tests. All comparisons were adjusted for demographic characteristics of relevance including, socioeconomic status (SES). Results: Both Obese and overweight ADHD children exhibited significantly lower SES compared to normal weight ADHD children. No significant differences were observed between the three groups with regards to their neurocognitive, emotional and motor profile. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that differences in weight/BMI are not accounted for by cognitive, motivational and motor profiles. Socio-economic characteristics are strongly associated with overweight and obesity in ADHD children and may inform strategies aimed at promoting healthier weight.

CHOLINERGIC RECEPTOR ACTIVATION INDUCES A RELATIVE FACILITATION OF SYNAPTIC RESPONSES IN THE ENTORHINAL CORTEX DURING THETA- AND GAMMA-FREQUENCY STIMULATION OF PARASUBICULAR INPUTS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						parasubiculum; entorhinal cortex; acetylcholine; theta; gamma; medial septum	LAYER-II NEURONS; MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; FREELY MOVING RATS; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS; MUSCARINIC MODULATION; POSTRHINAL CORTICES; FIRING PROPERTIES	The parasubiculum sends its single major output to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, and it may therefore interact with inputs to the entorhinal cortex from other cortical areas, and help to shape the activity of layer II entorhinal cells that project to the hippocampal formation. Cholinergic inputs are thought to contribute to the generation of theta- and gamma-frequency activities in the parasubiculum and entorhinal cortex, and the present study assessed how cholinergic receptor activation affects synaptic responses of the entorhinal cortex to theta- and gamma-frequency stimulation. Depth profiles of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in acute brain slices showed a short-latency negative fEPSP in layer II, consistent with the activation of excitatory synaptic inputs to layer II. Application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) suppressed synaptic responses and enhanced paired-pulse facilitation. CCh also resulted in a marked relative facilitation of synaptic responses evoked during short 5-pulse trains of stimulation at both theta- and gamma-frequencies. Application of the M-1 antagonist pirenzepine, but not the M-2 antagonist methoctramine, blocked the facilitation of responses. Inhibition of the M-current or block of GABA(B) receptors had no effect, but the facilitation effect was partially blocked by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist APV, indicating that NMDA receptors play a role. Application of ZD7288, a selective inhibitor of the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current I-h, almost completely blocked the relative facilitation of responses, and the less potent I-h-blocker Cs+ also resulted in a partial block. The relative facilitation of synaptic responses induced by CCh is therefore likely mediated by multiple mechanisms including the cholinergic suppression of transmitter release that enhances transmitter availability during repetitive stimulation, NMDA receptor-mediated effects on pre- or postsynaptic function, and cholinergic modulation of the current I-h. These mechanisms likely contribute to the maintenance of effective synaptic communication within parasubicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex during cholinergically induced rhythmic states.

Peripheral Nerve Injury Is Associated with Chronic, Reversible Changes in Global DNA Methylation in the Mouse Prefrontal Cortex	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CPG-BINDING PROTEIN-2; LOW-BACK-PAIN; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; LUMINOMETRIC METHYLATION; HISTONE DEACETYLASES; PERSISTENT PAIN; RAT MODEL; BRAIN; HYPOMETHYLATION; EXPRESSION	Changes in brain structure and cortical function are associated with many chronic pain conditions including low back pain and fibromyalgia. The magnitude of these changes correlates with the duration and/or the intensity of chronic pain. Most studies report changes in common areas involved in pain modulation, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and pain-related pathological changes in the PFC can be reversed with effective treatment. While the mechanisms underlying these changes are unknown, they must be dynamically regulated. Epigenetic modulation of gene expression in response to experience and environment is reversible and dynamic. Epigenetic modulation by DNA methylation is associated with abnormal behavior and pathological gene expression in the central nervous system. DNA methylation might also be involved in mediating the pathologies associated with chronic pain in the brain. We therefore tested a) whether alterations in DNA methylation are found in the brain long after chronic neuropathic pain is induced in the periphery using the spared nerve injury modal and b) whether these injury-associated changes are reversible by interventions that reverse the pathologies associated with chronic pain. Six months following peripheral nerve injury, abnormal sensory thresholds and increased anxiety were accompanied by decreased global methylation in the PFC and the amygdala but not in the visual cortex or the thalamus. Environmental enrichment attenuated nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity and reversed the changes in global PFC methylation. Furthermore, global PFC methylation correlated with mechanical and thermal sensitivity in neuropathic mice. In summary, induction of chronic pain by peripheral nerve injury is associated with epigenetic changes in the brain. These changes are detected long after the original injury, at a long distance from the site of injury and are reversible with environmental manipulation. Changes in brain structure and cortical function that are associated with chronic pain conditions may therefore be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms.

We, an invited panel of experts led by a working group of 3, critically examined the evidence and our collective experience regarding the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of ziprasidone across its clinical uses. There was no opportunity for manufacturer input into the content of the review. As anticipated, ziprasidone was found to be effective for its indicated uses, although its utility in mania and mixed states lacked comparative data. Beyond these uses, the available data were either unimpressive or were lacking. An attractive characteristic is its neutral effect on weight thereby providing patients with a non-obesogenic long-term treatment option. Key challenges in practice include the need for dosing on a full stomach and managing its early onset adverse effect of restlessness. Addressing these issues are critical to its long-term success	[Gardner, David M.; Murphy, Andrea L.; Kutcher, Stan; Carandang, Carlo; Milliken, Heather; O'Donovan, Claire] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychiat, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Beaulieu, Serge; Malla, Ashok] McGill Univ, Dept Psychiat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Labelle, Alain] Univ Ottawa, Dept Psychiat, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Lalonde, Pierre] Hop Louis H Lafontaine, Ctr Rech Fernand Seguin, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Schaffer, Ayal; Soni, Jorge; Taylor, Valerie H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Williams, Richard] Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychiat, Vancouver, BC, Canada	Gardner, DM (reprint author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychiat, Halifax, NS, Canada.	david.gardner@dal.ca	Taylor, Valerie/H-6242-2015		Pfizer; Astra Zeneca; Biovail; BMS; Eli Lilly; Janssen-Ortho; Lundbeck; Merck-Frosst; Novartis; Servier; Pfizer Canada	Dr. David Gardner has been involved with the advisory board for JanssenOrtho and has received education grant funding from Pfizer for this project.

Recent studies in rodents suggest that electroconvulsive stimulation-induced seizures (ECSs) influence hippocampal adult neurogenesis, which has gained considerable traction as a possible cellular substrate for the treatment of depression. The aim of this study is to explore alteration of neurogenesis in the hippocampus following ECSs and the relationship between neurogenesis and behavior in rats. In the present study, we administered a single or 10-repeated application of electroconvulsive stimulations that reliably resulted in seizure (an animal model of electroconvulsive therapy) to rats. Then cell proliferation of newborn cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyms (DG) was investigated 3 and 14 days after ECS treatments. Cell differentiation was also examined 4 weeks after newly formed cells were confirmed. As a result, ECS-induced cell proliferation in the hippocampus showed biphasic changes after ECS. The amount of cell proliferation at 3 days after the last ECS increased twice as much as the sham group. However, the number of proliferating cells at 14 days later decreased to a half of the sham level. Differentiation of newly formed cells was not influenced in ECS-treated groups compared with sham-treated groups. In addition, we investigated the effects of ECS on behavioral changes in rats by measuring locomotor activity in an open field test and spontaneous alteration behavior in a Y-maze test. Spontaneous behavior and memory function were not influenced by repeated ECSs. These results suggest that repeated ECSs affect progenitors that have a limited ability for cell proliferation, like amplifying progenitors, to increase newly generated neurons without negative behavioral change.

Importantly, modulation of synaptic activity by glial cells depends on the proper detection and decoding of synaptic activity. However, it remains unknown whether glial cells are capable of decoding synaptic activity and properties during early postdevelopmental stages, in particular when different presynaptic nerve terminals compete for the control of the same synaptic site. This may be particularly relevant because a major determinant of the outcome of synaptic competition process is the relative synaptic strength of competing terminals whereby stronger terminals are more likely to occupy postsynaptic territory and become stabilized while weaker terminals are often eliminated. Hence, because of their ability to decode synaptic activity, glial cells should be able to integrate neuronal information of competing terminals. Using simultaneous glial Ca2+ imaging and synaptic recordings of dually innervated mouse neuromuscular junctions, we report that single glial cells decipher the strength of competing nerve terminals. Activity of single glial cells, revealed by Ca2+ responses, reflects the synaptic strength of each competing nerve terminal and the state of synaptic competition. This deciphering is mediated by functionally segregated purinergic receptors and intrinsic properties of glial cells. Our results indicate that glial cells decode ongoing synaptic competition and, hence, are poised to influence its outcome.

The endothelial cells (ECs) of the BBB possess specific properties that restrict the entry of cells and metabolites into the CNS. The specialized BBB endothelial phenotype is induced during neurovascular development by surrounding cells of the CNS. However, the molecular differentiation of the BBB endothelium remains poorly understood. Retinoic acid (RA) plays a crucial role in the brain during embryogenesis. Because radial glial cells supply the brain with RA during the developmental cascade and associate closely with the developing vasculature, we hypothesize that RA is important for the induction of BBB properties in brain ECs. Analysis of human postmortem fetal brain tissue shows that the enzyme mainly responsible for RA synthesis, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, is expressed by radial glial cells. In addition, the most important receptor for RA-driven signaling in the CNS, RA-receptor beta (RAR beta), is markedly expressed by the developing brain vasculature. Our findings have been further corroborated by in vitro experiments showing RA-and RAR beta-dependent induction of different aspects of the brain EC barrier. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of RAR activation during the differentiation of the murine BBB resulted in the leakage of a fluorescent tracer as well as serum proteins into the developing brain and reduced the expression levels of important BBB determinants. Together, our results point to an important role for RA in the induction of the BBB during human and mouse development.	[Mizee, Mark R.; Wooldrik, Desiree; Lakeman, Kim A.

Here we expressed the wild-type human gene (wtTARDBP) or the ALS mutation G348C (mutTARDBP) in zebrafish larvae and characterized their motor (swimming) activity and the structure and function of their neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Of these groups only mutTARDBP larvae showed impaired swimming and increased motoneuron vulnerability with reduced synaptic fidelity, reduced quantal transmission, and more orphaned presynaptic and postsynaptic structures at the NMJ. Remarkably, all behavioral and cellular features were stabilized by chronic treatment with either of the L-type calcium channel agonists FPL 64176 or Bay K 8644. These results indicate that expression of mutTARDBP results in defective NMJs and that calcium channel agonists could be novel therapeutics for ALS.	[Armstrong, Gary A.

Effect of Maternal Lipopolysaccharide Administration on the Development of Dopaminergic Receptors and Transporter in the Rat Offspring	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRENATAL IMMUNE ACTIVATION; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; WORKING-MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; CORTICAL INTERNEURONS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BACTERIAL-ENDOTOXIN; ANIMAL-MODELS; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Epidemiological evidence supports that maternal infection during gestation are notable risk factors for developmental mental illnesses including schizophrenia and autism. In prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of immune activation in rats, the offspring exhibit significant impairments in behaviors mediated by central dopamine (DA) system. This study aimed to examine the temporal and regional pattern of postnatal DA development in the male offspring of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats administered with 100 mu g/kg LPS or saline at gestational days 15/16. Using ligand autoradiography, D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (D1R, D2R) and dopamine transporter (DAT) binding levels were measured in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and sub cortical regions (dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens core and shell) at pre pubertal (P35) and post pubertal ages (P60). We found a significant decrease in D2R ligand [H-3] YM-90151-2 binding in the medial PFC (mPFC) in prenatal LPS-treated animals at P35 and P60 compared to respective saline groups. The decrease in D2R levels was not observed in the striatum or accumbens of maternal LPS-treated animals. No significant changes were observed in [H-3] SCH23390 binding to D1R. However, the level of [I-125] RTI-121 binding to DAT was selectively reduced in the nucleus accumbens core and shell at P35 in the prenatal LPS group. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that number of D2R immunopositive cells in infralimbic/prelimbic (IL/PL) part of mPFC was significantly reduced in the LPS group at P60. Prenatal LPS treatment did not significantly affect either the total number of mature neurons or parvalbumin (PV)- immunopositive interneurons in this region. However the number of PV and D2R co-labeled neurons was significantly reduced in the IL/PL subregion of PFC of LPS treated animals. Our data suggests D2R deficit in the PFC and PV interneurons may be relevant to understanding mechanisms of cortical dysfunctions described in prenatal infection animal models as well as schizophrenia.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is strongly implicated in ASDs by means of upstream signalling; however, downstream regulatory mechanisms are ill-defined. Here we show that knockout of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2)-an eIF4E repressor downstream of mTOR-or eIF4E overexpression leads to increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins that are causally linked to ASDs. Mice that have the gene encoding 4E-BP2 (Eif4ebp2) knocked out exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviours (that is, social interaction deficits, altered communication and repetitive/stereotyped behaviours). Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E activity or normalization of neuroligin 1, but not neuroligin 2, protein levels restores the normal excitation/inhibition ratio and rectifies the social behaviour deficits. Thus, translational control by eIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins, maintaining the excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation engenders ASD-like phenotypes.

Early Musical Training and White-Matter Plasticity in the Corpus Callosum: Evidence for a Sensitive Period	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; COCHLEAR IMPLANTS; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; WATER DIFFUSION; TRACTOGRAPHY; MUSICIANS; LANGUAGE; ARCHITECTURE	Training during a sensitive period in development may have greater effects on brain structure and behavior than training later in life. Musicians are an excellent model for investigating sensitive periods because training starts early and can be quantified. Previous studies suggested that early training might be related to greater amounts of white matter in the corpus callosum, but did not control for length of training or identify behavioral correlates of structural change. The current study compared white-matter organization using diffusion tensor imaging in early-and late-trained musicians matched for years of training and experience. We found that early-trained musicians had greater connectivity in the posterior midbody/isthmus of the corpus callosum and that fractional anisotropy in this region was related to age of onset of training and sensorimotor synchronization performance. We propose that training before the age of 7 years results in changes in white-matter connectivity that may serve as a scaffold upon which ongoing experience can build.

DNA Sequence Variants in PPARGC1A, a Gene Encoding a Coactivator of the omega-3 LCPUFA Sensing PPAR-RXR Transcription Complex, Are Associated with NV AMD and AMD-Associated Loci in Genes of Complement and VEGF Signaling Pathways	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; ACTIVATED-RECEPTOR-GAMMA; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MACULAR DEGENERATION; CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION; NEUROPROTECTIN D1; MESSENGER-RNA; UNITED-STATES; FATTY-ACIDS; POLYMORPHISMS	Background: Increased intake of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) and use of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR)-activating drugs are associated with attenuation of pathologic retinal angiogenesis. omega-3 LCPUFAs are endogenous agonists of PPARs. We postulated that DNA sequence variation in PPAR gamma (PPARG) co-activator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A), a gene encoding a co-activator of the LCPUFA-sensing PPARG-retinoid X receptor (RXR) transcription complex, may influence neovascularization (NV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: We applied exact testing methods to examine distributions of DNA sequence variants in PPARGC1A for association with NV AMD and interaction of AMD-associated loci in genes of complement, lipid metabolism, and VEGF signaling systems. Our sample contained 1858 people from 3 elderly cohorts of western European ancestry. We concurrently investigated retinal gene expression profiles in 17-day-old neonatal mice on a 2% LCPUFA feeding paradigm to identify LCPUFA-regulated genes both associated with pathologic retinal angiogenesis and known to interact with PPARs or PPARGC1A. Results: A DNA coding variant (rs3736265) and a 3'UTR-resident regulatory variant (rs3774923) in PPARGC1A were independently associated with NV AMD (exact P = 0.003, both SNPs). SNP-SNP interactions existed for NV AMD (P<0.005) with rs3736265 and a AMD-associated variant in complement factor B (CFB, rs512559). PPARGC1A influences activation of the AMD-associated complement component 3 (C3) promoter fragment and CFB influences activation and proteolysis of C3. We observed interaction (P <= 0.003) of rs3736265 with a variant in vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA, rs3025033), a key molecule in retinal angiogenesis. Another PPARGC1A coding variant (rs8192678) showed statistical interaction with a SNP in the VEGFA receptor fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1, rs10507386; P <= 0.003). C3 expression was down-regulated 2-fold in retinas of omega-3 LCPUFA-fed mice - these animals also showed 70% reduction in retinal NV (P <= 0.001). Conclusion: Ligands and co-activators of the omega-3 LCPUFA sensing PPAR-RXR axis may influence retinal angiogenesis in NV AMD via the complement and VEGF signaling systems. We have linked the co-activator of a lipid-sensing transcription factor (PPARG co-activator 1 alpha, PPARGC1A) to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and AMD-associated genes.

White matter appears differently across the cortical lobes in MR images acquired during early postnatal development. Specifically at 1-year of age, the gray/white matter contrast of MRT1 and T2 weighted images in prefrontal and temporal lobes is reduced as compared to the rest of the brain, and thus, tissue segmentation results commonly show lower accuracy in these lobes. In this novel work, we propose the use of spatial intensity growth maps (IGM) for T1 and 12 weighted images to compensate for local appearance inhomogeneity. The IGM captures expected intensity changes from 1 to 2 years of age, as appearance homogeneity is greatly improved by the age of 24 months. The IGM was computed as the coefficient of a voxel-wise linear regression model between corresponding intensities at 1 and 2 years. The proposed IGM method revealed low regression values of 1-10% in GM and CSF regions, as well as in WM regions at maturation stage of myelination at 1 year. However, in the prefrontal and temporal lobes we observed regression values of 20-25%, indicating that the IGM appropriately captures the expected large intensity change in these lobes mainly due to myelination. The IGM is applied to cross-sectional MRI datasets of 1-year-old subjects via registration, correction and tissue segmentation of the IGM-corrected dataset. We validated our approach in a small leave-one-out study of images with known, manual 'ground truth' segmentations. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Thus, we examined the associations among genetic risk, illness burden, lithium treatment, and brain structure in BD. Methods: This is a two-center, replication-design, structural magnetic resonance imaging study. First, we investigated neuroanatomic markers of familial predisposition by comparing 50 unaffected and 36 affected relatives of BD probands as well as 49 control subjects using modulated voxel-based morphometry. Second, we investigated effects of long-standing illness and treatment on the identified markers in 19 young participants early in the course of BD, 29 subjects with substantial burden of long-lasting BD and either minimal lifetime (n = 12), or long-term ongoing (n = 17) lithium treatment. Results: Five groups, including the unaffected and affected relatives of BD probands from each center as well as participants early in the course of BD showed larger right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) volumes than control subjects (corrected p < .001). The rIFG volume correlated negatively with illness duration (corrected p < .01) and, relative to the controls, was smaller among BD individuals with long-term illness burden and minimal lifetime lithium exposure (corrected p < .001). Li-treated subjects had normal rIFG volumes despite substantial illness burden. Conclusions: Brain structural changes in BD may result from interplay between illness burden and compensatory processes, which may be enhanced by lithium treatment. The rIFG volume could aid in identification of subjects at risk for BD even before any behavioral manifestations.

Morphology and microstructure of subcortical structures at birth: A large-scale Asian neonatal neuroimaging study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; Diffusion tensor imaging; Myelination; Infant brain	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; GRAY-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; INFANTS; MRI; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CHILDHOOD; WHITE; ADOLESCENCE	This paper presents the growth pattern and sexual dimorphism of the thalamus and basal ganglia in a large-scale Asian neonatal cohort using both T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Our study observed a robust growth of the thalamus and basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and anterior limb of internal capsule) beyond the overall brain growth in the early postnatal period (36-43 weeks of the gestational age). Additionally, the microstructure of the two structures was integrated as reflected by an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) and a decrease in axial and radial water diffusivities in the first few weeks of life. Sexual dimorphism was only observed in the whole brain growth and the left thalamic volume but not in the other volumes or DTI measures of the basal ganglia and thalamus at birth. Even though the pattern of sexual dimorphism in the total brain volume is present at birth and persists throughout postnatal brain development, sexual dimorphisms of the basal ganglia and thalamus differ from those found in later stages of brain development, indicating that regionally distinct patterns of postnatal brain development between males and females arise after birth.

In recent years there have been considerable advances in MEG hardware developments and methods. Sophisticated analysis techniques are now routinely applied and continuously improved, leading to fascinating insights into the intricate dynamics of neural processes. However, the rapidly increasing level of complexity of the different steps in a MEG study make it difficult for novices, and sometimes even for experts, to stay aware of possible limitations and caveats. Furthermore, the complexity of MEG data acquisition and data analysis requires special attention when describing MEG studies in publications, in order to facilitate interpretation and reproduction of the results. This manuscript aims at making recommendations for a number of important data acquisition and data analysis steps and suggests details that should be specified in manuscripts reporting MEG studies. These recommendations will hopefully serve as guidelines that help to strengthen the position of the MEG research community within the field of neuroscience, and may foster discussion in order to further enhance the quality and impact of MEG research.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential of revealing early signs of neurodegeneration in the human brain and may thus aid in predicting and diagnosing AD. Surface-based cortical thickness measurements from T1-weighted MRI have demonstrated high sensitivity to cortical gray matter changes. In this study we investigated the possibility for using patterns of cortical thickness measurements for predicting AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used a novel technique for identifying cortical regions potentially discriminative for separating individuals with MCI who progress to probable AD, from individuals with MCI who do not progress to probable AD. Specific patterns of atrophy were identified at four time periods before diagnosis of probable AD and features were selected as regions of interest within these patterns. The selected regions were used for cortical thickness measurements and applied in a classifier for testing the ability to predict AD at the four stages. In the validation, the test subjects were excluded from the feature selection to obtain unbiased results. The accuracy of the prediction improved as the time to conversion from MCI to AD decreased, from 70% at 3 years before the clinical criteria for AD was met, to 76% at 6 months before AD. By inclusion of test subjects in the feature selection process, the prediction accuracies were artificially inflated to a range of 73% to 81%. Two important results emerge from this study. First, prediction accuracies of conversion from MCI to AD can be improved by learning the atrophy patterns that are specific to the different stages of disease progression. This has the potential to guide the further development of imaging biomarkers in AD. Second, the results show that one needs to be careful when designing training, testing and validation schemes to ensure that datasets used to build the predictive models are not used in testing and validation.

Epoch-specific functional networks involved in working memory	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; TERM-MEMORY; CORTEX; ATTENTION; BRAIN; DEACTIVATION; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; MAINTENANCE	Working memory (WM) is not a unitary construct. There are distinct processes involved in encoding information, maintaining it on-line, and using it to guide responses. The anatomical configurations of these processes are more accurately analyzed as functionally connected networks than collections of individual regions. In the current study we analyzed event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm WM task using a multivariate analysis method that allowed the linking of functional networks to temporally-separated WM epochs. The length of the delay epochs was varied to optimize isolation of the hemodynamic response (HDR) for each task epoch. All extracted functional networks displayed statistically significant sensitivity to delay length. Novel information extracted from these networks that was not apparent in the univariate analysis of these data included involvement of the hippocampus in encoding/probe, and decreases in BOLD signal in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), along with default-mode regions, during encoding/delay. The bilateral hippocampal activity during encoding/delay fits with theoretical models of WM in which memoranda held across the short term are activated long-term memory representations. The BOLD signal decreases in the STG were unexpected, and may reflect repetition suppression effects invoked by internal repetition of letter stimuli. Thus, analysis methods focusing on how network dynamics relate to experimental conditions allowed extraction of novel information not apparent in univariate analyses, and are particularly recommended for WM experiments for which task epochs cannot be randomized.

There is considerable evidence that many individual characteristics and experiential variables can modulate the behavioral and neural changes that are seen following repeated exposure to stimulant drugs. In the work presented here, we examined whether chronic wheel running would modulate behavioral sensitization to cocaine, and whether any such influence was contingent on individual differences in wheel running. We found that a 5- or 10-week experience with wheel running protects against behavioral sensitization to cocaine but only in animals with a natural tendency to run the most. Understanding the mechanism underlying the modulating effect of wheel running on behavioral sensitization may have important implications for future studies on the link between drug-induced behavioral and neural adaptations.

Early postnatal experience and DRD2 genotype affect dopamine receptor expression in the rat ventral striatum	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Adversity; Development; Polymorphism; Dopamine; Accumbens; D2	SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS; MESSENGER-RNA; MATERNAL-DEPRIVATION; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; EARLY ADVERSITY; GENE; CORTICOSTERONE; STRESS	Dopamine systems can be altered by experiences such as early life adversity. The intensity of these effects seems to vary as a function of interactions between genetic and environmental influences. In a series of experiments we have investigated the effects of genetic variants and early life adversity on several biobehavioral outcomes. Here we investigated the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene coding for dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) and the interaction between these variants with early life adversity on the expression of D2 receptors in the striatum. Time-mated pregnant female rats underwent restraint stress (gestational days 10-21) or were left undisturbed. Following parturition rat pups were maternally reared (MR) or artificially reared (AR). Subsequent to adult behavioral testing, rats were genotyped and their brains were processed (autoradiography) for D2 receptor expression. We found three variants in the DRD2 gene and these variants interacted with early adversity to affect D2 receptor expression in the nucleus accumbens. Specifically, artificially reared rats with AG DRD2 variant showed significantly higher D2 expression compared to mother reared rats with the AG DRD2 variant as well as the artificially reared rats with a GG DRD2 variant. These findings show that adult D2 expression is significantly influenced by the interaction of DRD2 SNPs and early developmental factors. These finding may explain why there are significant individual differences in the impact of early life adversity on dopamine-dependent processes and disorder vulnerabilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Vacuolar-type H+-ATPase V1A subunit is a molecular partner of Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1) protein, which regulates its expression and stability	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							PANCREATIC BETA-CELLS; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; BREAST-CANCER CELLS; V-ATPASE; INSULIN-SECRETION; INDUCED APOPTOSIS; PROTON PUMPS; ER STRESS; GENE; MICE	Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neurodegeneration and diabetes mellitus. The gene responsible for the syndrome (WFS1) encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein that also localizes to secretory granules in pancreatic beta cells. Although its precise functions are unknown, WFS1 protein deficiency affects the unfolded protein response, intracellular ion homeostasis, cell cycle progression and granular acidification. In this study, immunofluorescent and electron-microscopy analyses confirmed that WFS1 also localizes to secretory granules in human neuroblastoma cells. We demonstrated a novel interaction between WFS1 and the V1A subunit of the H V-ATPase (proton pump) by co-immunoprecipitation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and with endogenous proteins in human neuroblastoma cells. We mapped the interaction to the WFS1-N terminal, but not the C-terminal domain. V1A subunit expression was reduced in WFS1 stably and transiently depleted human neuroblastoma cells and depleted NT2 (human neuron-committed teratocarcinoma) cells. This reduced expression was not restored by adenoviral overexpression of BiP (immunoglobulin-binding protein) to correct the ER stress. Protein stability assays demonstrated that the V1A subunit was degraded more rapidly in WFS1 depleted neuroblastoma cells compared with wild-type; however, proteosomal inhibition did not restore the expression of the V1A subunit. Cell cycle assays measuring p21(cip) showed reduced levels in WFS1 depleted cells, and an inverse association between p21(cip) expression and apoptosis. We conclude that WFS1 has a specific interaction with the V1A subunit of H ATPase; this interaction may be important both for pump assembly in the ER and for granular acidification.

Anne			Enhanced Recruitment of Endosomal Na+/H+ Exchanger NHE6 into Dendritic Spines of Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons during NMDA Receptor-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LINKED MENTAL-RETARDATION; AMPA RECEPTORS; RECYCLING ENDOSOMES; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORT; ANGELMAN-SYNDROME; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; ENDOCYTIC ZONES; SLICE CULTURES; SMALL GTPASE	Postsynaptic endosomal trafficking has emerged as a principal regulatory mechanism of structural and functional plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. Recycling endosomes perform activity-dependent transport of AMPA receptors(AMPARs) and lipids to the postsynaptic membrane, activities that are known to contribute to long-term synaptic potentiation and hypothesized to subserve learning and memory processes in the brain. Recently, genetic defects in a widely expressed vesicular pH-regulating transporter, the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE6 isoform, have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders including severe X-linked mental retardation and autism. However, little information is available regarding the cellular properties of this transporter in the CNS. Here, we show by quantitative light microscopy that the protein abundance of NHE6 is developmentally regulated in area CA1 of the mouse hippocampus. Within pyramidal neurons, NHE6 was found to localize to discrete puncta throughout the soma and neurites, with noticeable accumulation at dendritic spines and presynaptic terminals. Dual immunolabeling of dendritic spines revealed that NHE6 partially colocalizes with typical markers of early and recycling endosomes as well as with the AMPAR subunit GluA1. Significantly, NHE6-containing vesicles exhibited enhanced translocation to dendritic spine heads during NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation. These data suggest that NHE6 may play a unique, previously unrecognized, role at glutamatergic synapses that are important for learning and memory.

However, less is known about its impact on specific intracortical inhibitory mechanisms, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABA(B))-mediated inhibition. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to assess the impact of anodal and cathodal tDCS on M1 intracortical inhibition in healthy individuals. Long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) and cortical silent period (CSP) duration, both presumably mediated by GABA(B) receptors, were assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation immediately before and after a 20 min session of tDCS over the left M1. Anodal tDCS significantly enhanced motor evoked potential size and reduced CSP duration, whereas it had no effect on LICI. Cathodal stimulation did not significantly modulate motor evoked potential size, CSP duration or LICI. This study provides evidence that anodal tDCS, presumably by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, has a direct effect on GABA(B)-meditated inhibition assessed by the CSP, but not by LICI. Our results further suggest that CSP and LICI probe distinct intracortical inhibitory mechanisms as they are differentially modulated by anodal tDCS. Finally, these data may have clinical value in patients in whom a pathological increase in CSP duration is present, such as schizophrenia.

J	Gravel, P; Verhaeghe, J; Reader, AJ				Gravel, Paul; Verhaeghe, Jeroen; Reader, Andrew J.			3D PET image reconstruction including both motion correction and registration directly into an MR or stereotaxic spatial atlas	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RESOLUTION RESEARCH TOMOGRAPH; ECAT HRRT; COMPENSATION; BRAIN; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS; MODELS	This work explores the feasibility and impact of including both the motion correction and the image registration transformation parameters from positron emission tomography (PET) image space to magnetic resonance (MR), or stereotaxic, image space within the system matrix of PET image reconstruction. This approach is motivated by the fields of neuroscience and psychiatry, where PET is used to investigate differences in activation patterns between different groups of participants, requiring all images to be registered to a common spatial atlas. Currently, image registration is performed after image reconstruction which introduces interpolation effects into the final image. Furthermore, motion correction (also requiring registration) introduces a further level of interpolation, and the overall result of these operations can lead to resolution degradation and possibly artifacts. It is important to note that performing such operations on a post-reconstruction basis means, strictly speaking, that the final images are not ones which maximize the desired objective function (e.g. maximum likelihood (ML), or maximum a posteriori reconstruction (MAP)). To correctly seek parameter estimates in the desired spatial atlas which are in accordance with the chosen reconstruction objective function, it is necessary to include the transformation parameters for both motion correction and registration within the system modeling stage of image reconstruction. Such an approach not only respects the statistically chosen objective function (e.g. ML or MAP), but furthermore should serve to reduce the interpolation effects. To evaluate the proposed method, this work investigates registration (including motion correction) using 2D and 3D simulations based on the high resolution research tomograph (HRRT) PET scanner geometry, with and without resolution modeling, using the ML expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction algorithm. The quality of reconstruction was assessed using bias-variance and root mean squared error analyses, comparing the proposed method to conventional post-reconstruction registration methods. An overall reduction in bias (for a cold region: from 41% down to 31% (2D) and 97% down to 65% (3D), and for a hot region: from 11% down to 8% (2D) and from 16% down to 14% (3D)) and in root mean squared error analyses (for a cold region: from 43% to 37% (2D) and from 97% to 65% (3D), and for a hot region: from 11% to 9% (2D) and from 16% down to 14% (3D)) in reconstructed regional mean activities (full regions of interest; all with statistical significance: p < 5 x 10(-10)) is found when including the motion correction and registration in the system matrix of the MLEM reconstruction, with resolution modeling. However, this improvement in performance comes with an extra computational cost of about 40 min. In this context, this work constitutes an important step toward the goal of estimating parameters of interest directly from the raw Poisson-distributed PET data, and hence toward the complete elimination of post-processing steps.

On one hand, handcraft design of features is difficult, depending on expert knowledge and on heuristics. On the other hand, biologically inspired neural networks are able to learn automatically features from the input image, but requires a good underlying model. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of automatically learned features compared to handcrafted features, as they provide a promising alternative to the difficult task of features handcrafting. In this work, the recognition model is based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) neural networks. This model has been shown to outperform the well-known HMM model for various handwriting tasks, thanks to its reliable probabilistic modeling. In its multidimensional form, called MDLSTM, this network is able to automatically learn features from the input image. For evaluation, we compare the MDLSTM learned features and four state-of-the-art handcrafted features. The IFN/ENIT database has been used as benchmark for Arabic word recognition, where the results are promising.

However the lack of learning examplers combined to low computational cost suggests building robust and efficient learning machines. In this paper we introduce a hybrid model of ART-2A neural network combined to Takagi-Sugeno (TS) neurofuzzy network. The latter model is applied for online handwritten gesture recognition, when the learning is starting from scratch and no class information, such as gesture type or number of classes, is predefined. Moreover, using ART-2A neural network and our novel distance measure, the computational complexity of the whole model decreases while preserving high accuracy. Furthermore, we exploit the forgetting dilemma of online learning by introducing a competitive Recursive Least Squares method for TS models. Together, all the modeling has shown promising results.

They map information from angiography images onto the patient on the operating room table to localize important vessels. This spatial mapping is complex, time consuming and prone to error. We've developed an augmented reality (AR) system to visualize the pre-operative vascular data within the context of a microscope/camera image. Such an AR visualization enhances the surgeon's field of view with data that is not otherwise readily available (e.g., anatomical data beyond the visible surface or data about the flow of blood through the vessels), and it aids the surgeon to better understand the topology and locations of vessels that lie below the visible surface of the cortex. In this paper, we explore a number of different volume rendering methods for AR visualization of vessel topology and blood flow.	[Kersten-Oertel, Marta; Drouin, Simon; Chen, Sean J. S.; Collins, D.

By extending the recent diffeomorphic log-demons (DLD) method and applying it to multiple dynamic [C-11]raclopride scans from the HRRT, an important step towards construction of a PET atlas of unprecedented quality for [C-11]raclopride imaging of the human brain has been achieved. Accounting for the temporal dimension in PET data improves registration accuracy when compared to registration of 3D to 3D time-averaged PET images. The DLD approach was chosen for its ease in providing both an intensity and shape template, through iterative sequential pair-wise registrations with fast convergence. The proposed method is applicable to any PET radiotracer, providing 4D atlases with useful applications in high accuracy PET data simulations and automated PET image analysis.

Two different silicon APDs are fabricated separately and also integrated with a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) front-end using standard CMOS technology. SiAPDs are designed in p+/n-well structure with guard rings realized in different shapes. The TIA front-end has been designed using distributed-gain concept combined with resistive-feedback and common-gate topology to reach low-noise and high gain-bandwidth product (GBW) characteristics. The integrated SiAPDs show higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sensitivity and detection efficiency comparing to the separate SiAPDs. The integration does not show a significant effect on the gain and preserves the low power consumption. Using APDs with p-well guard-ring is preferred due to the higher observed efficiency after integration.

Inferring synaptic input of a neuron only from its membrane potential (output) that contains both sub-threshold and action potentials can effectively elucidate the information processing mechanism of a neuron. The term coined blind deconvolution of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuronal model is defined, for the first time in this paper, to address the problem of reconstructing the hidden dynamics and synaptic input of a single neuron modeled by the HH model as well as estimating its intrinsic parameters only from single trace of noisy membrane potential. The blind deconvolution is accomplished via a recursive algorithm whose iterations contain running an extended Kalman filtering followed by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm have been demonstrated by our simulations. The capability of the proposed algorithm makes it particularly useful to understand the neural coding mechanism of a neuron.	[Lankarany, M.; Zhu, W-P.; Swamy, M. N.

The model relies on known interconnections between saccadic burst circuits in the brainstem and ocular premotor areas in the vestibular nuclei during slow and fast phase intervals. A viable switching strategy for the timing of nystagmus events is proposed. Simulations show that this hybrid model replicates AVOR nystagmus patterns that are observed in experimentally recorded data.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based systems, have been widely used in different applications in construction and maintenance. This paper investigates the usage of active RFID technology for the localization of movable objects (e. g. material, equipment, tools, and assets) equipped with RFID tags using handheld readers. The method builds on Cluster-based Movable Tag Localization (CMTL) technique which uses k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. CMTL uses multidimensional clustering technique that considers signal pattern similarity between target and reference tags together with spatial distribution of reference tags for detecting the region where the target tag is located. This paper proposes applying an irregular bilinear interpolation method to form a grid of virtual reference tags within the selected cluster of real reference tags. Moreover, the proposed method uses artificial neural networks (ANN) for positioning the target tag, as opposed to empirical weighted averaging formulas used in similar k-NN based methods. Comparative analysis is performed to quantify the improvement of the proposed method over similar k-NN-based methods using a simulation environment. A case study is performed to analyze the performance of the proposed method.

More precisely, eleven economic factors, twelve technical indicators and four measures of investor's mood were selected as potential predictive variables. Then, the Granger causality test was performed to identify among them the predictive variables that show a strong relationship with the stock market. Finally, the identified inputs are fed to k-NN and PNN separately and the correct detection of stock market ups (+0.5%) -aggressive investment strategy-is computed using the obtained hit ratios. The simulations results from 10-fold experiments show that the average detection rate of k-NN and PNN are respectively 93.45% (+/- 0.0019, standard deviation) and 92.4% (+/- 0.006, standard deviation). The results suggest that aggregating the three categories of information (economic, technical, and psychological information) along with k-NN as classifier leads to high detection accuracy of future stock market ups and downs.

One peak that has been understudied is the affinity that many individuals with WS have with music. It remains unknown whether their high levels of musical interest, skill, and expressivity are related to their sociable personality or their verbal intelligence. We examined the relationships between musicality (musical interest, creativity, and expressivity), sociability (social-emotionality, social approach), and language comprehension in WS and typically developing (TD) controls. Findings suggest that emotion-expressivity through music in WS may be linked to sensitivity and responsivity to emotions of others, whereas general interest in music may be related to greater linguistic capacity in TD individuals. Musicality and sociability may be more closely related in WS relative to typical development. Implications for future interventions for this neurodevelopmental condition are discussed.

Its relative ease of deployment, low cost, and high availability have secured for this recording technique a place of choice in the neuroscience and neuromedecine armada. Given these qualities and its important user base, investigation of the central nervous system could largely benefit from the development of new analysis techniques for EEG recordings. This paper contributes to a better exploitation of EEG databases by proposing a new methodology to assess temporal displacements of transient activity of scalp action potential fields. This technique establishes relationships through a cross-correlation analysis - between the time-frequency representations of different recording channels. An example application is given for the propagation of EEG sleep spindles but larger applicability to other transient waveforms recorded on dense arrays of sensors is also possible.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the development of intermediate-level vision by assessing the ability to discriminate circular shapes (global) whose contour was defined by different local attributes: luminance and texture. School-aged children, adolescents, and adults were asked to discriminate a deformed circle (radial frequency patterns or RFP) from a circle. RFPs varied as a function of (a) number of bumps or curvatures (radial frequency of three, five, and 10) and (b) the physical attribute (luminance or texture) that defined the contour. Deformation thresholds were measured for each radial frequency and attribute condition. In general, results indicated that when compared to adolescents and adults children performed worse only when luminance-defined shapes had fewer curvatures (i.e., three and five), but for texture-defined shapes, children performed worse across all types of radial frequencies (three, five, and 10). This suggests that sensitivity to global shapes mediated by intermediate level vision is differentially affected by the type of local information defining the global shape at different periods of development.

However, the systematic examination of all scales is a tedious task. Here, I propose a method to select a limited number of scales that are representative of the full hierarchy. A bootstrap analysis is first performed to estimate stability matrices, which quantify the reliability of the clustering for every pair of brain regions, over a grid of possible scales. A subset of scales is then selected to approximate linearly all stability matrices with a specified level of accuracy. On real data, the method was found to select a relatively small (similar to 7) number of scales to explain 95% of the energy of 73 scales ranging from 2 to 1100 clusters. The number of selected scales was very consistent across 43 subjects, and the actual scales also showed some good level of agreement. This approach thus provides a principled approach to mine hierarchical brain networks, in the form of a few scales amenable to detailed examination.

As the nervous system controls the muscle activity, the electromyography (EMG) signals can be viewed and examined in order to detect the vital features of the ALS disease in individuals. In this paper, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based features, which are extracted from a frame of EMG data, are introduced to classify the normal person and the ALS patients. From each frame of EMG data, instead of using a large number of DWT coefficients, the DWT coefficients with higher values as well as their mean and maxima are proposed to be used, which drastically reduces the feature dimension. It is shown that the proposed feature vector offers a high within class compactness and between class separations. For the purpose of classification, the K-nearest neighborhood classifier is employed. In order to demonstrate the classification performance, an EMG database consisted of 5 normal subjects and 5 ALS patients is considered and it is found that the proposed method is capable of distinctly separating the ALS patients from the normal persons.

It exploits lobe asymmetry to distinguish the normal and abnormal brain MR images. Each MR image is first processed to emphasize edges before splitting it into right lobe and left lobe components. These are transformed into one-dimensional signals and the corresponding power spectral density functions (PSDF) are estimated. Then, a four-dimensional feature vector is formed with the energy of each PSDF and their correlation coefficient calculated by two approaches. Using leave-one-out cross validation on a dataset of seven normal and seven glioma affected MR images, 100% classification accuracy was achieved by a support vector machine classifier, with near real-time processing time.

Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuronal model has been considered as the most detailed biophysical model for representing the dynamical behavior of the spiking neurons. In this paper, we derive, for the first time, the dual extended Kalman filtering (DEKF) approach for the HH neuronal model to track the dynamics and estimate the parameters of a single neuron from noisy recorded membrane voltage. As unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has been already applied to the HH model, a quantitative comparison between these methods is accomplished in our simulation for different signal to observation noise ratios. Our simulations demonstrate the high accuracy of DEKF in the prediction and estimation of hidden states and unknown parameters of the HH neuronal model. Faster implementation of DEKF (than UKF) makes it particularly useful in dynamic clamp technique.	[Lankarany, Milad; Zhu, W. -P.; Swamy, M. N.

But, unlike NCX, much less is known about the physiological roles of NCKX, while emergent evidence indicates that NCKX has highly specialized functions in cells and tissues where it is expressed. As their name implies, there are functional similarities in the properties of the two Ca2+ exchanger families, but there are specific differences as well. Here, we compare and contrast their key functional properties of ionic dependence and affinities, as well as report on the effects of KB-R7943 - a compound that is widely used to differentiate the two exchangers. We also review structural similarities and differences between the two exchangers. The aim is to draw attention to key differences that will aid in differentiating the two exchangers in physiological contexts where both exist but perhaps play distinct roles.

In mammals, neural acid-base homeostasis is coordinately regulated by ion transporters belonging to the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) and bicarbonate transporter gene families. However, the relative contributions of individual isoforms within the respective families are not fully understood. This report focuses on the NHE family, specifically the plasma membrane-type NHE5 which is preferentially transcribed in brain, but the distribution of the native protein has not been extensively characterized. To this end, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes NHE5. In both central (cortex, hippocampus) and peripheral (superior cervical ganglia, SCG) nervous tissue of mice, NHE5 immunostaining was punctate and highly concentrated in the somas and to lesser amounts in the dendrites of neurons. Very little signal was detected in axons. Similarly, in primary cultures of differentiated SCG neurons, NHE5 localized predominantly to vesicles in the somatodendritic compartment, though some immunostaining was also evident in punctate vesicles along the axons. NHE5 was also detected predominantly in intracellular vesicles of cultured SCG glial cells. Dual immunolabeling of SCG neurons showed that NHE5 did not colocalize with markers for early endosomes (EEA1) or synaptic vesicles (synaptophysin), but did partially colocalize with the transferrin receptor, a marker of recycling endosomes. Collectively, these data suggest that NHE5 partitions into a unique vesicular pool in neurons that shares some characteristics of recycling endosomes where it may serve as an important regulated store of functional transporters required to maintain cytoplasmic pH homeostasis.

Two different technologies, IBM CMOS 0.13 mu m, and DALSA Teledyne 0.8 mu m 5V/20V CMOS/DMOS, are used to implement the device in 2 chips. The microelectrode driver is incorporated with an array of highly-configurable high-voltage switches, which are supplied with +/- 13 Volts. The measurement results show that the system delivers up to 180 mu A through emulated microelectrode-tissue interface impedance with an average value of 100k Omega.

However, many of the enhancing voxels are associated with normal structures (i.e. blood vessels) or noise in the MRI, making the detection of Gad-enhancing lesions a challenging task. Furthermore, these lesions are typically small and in close proximity to vessels. In this paper, we present a probabilistic Adaptive Multi-level Conditional Random Field (AMCRF) framework, capable of leveraging spatial and temporal information, for detection of MS Gad-enhancing lesions. In the first level, a voxel based CRF with cliques of up to size three, is used to identify candidate lesions. In the second level, higher order potentials are incorporated leveraging robust textural features which are invariant to rotation and local intensity distortions. Furthermore, we show how to exploit temporal and longitudinal images, should they be available, into the AMCRF model. The proposed algorithm is tested on 120 multimodal clinical datasets acquired from Relapsing-Remitting MS patients during multi-center clinical trials. Results show a sensitivity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 70% and average False Positive (FP) counts of 0.77. Moreover, the temporal AMCRF results show the same sensitivity as the AMCRF model while decreasing the FP counts by 22%.

In the first stage, a customised Gabor decomposition is developed, based on the combined-space characteristics of the two classes (tumour and non-tumour) in multispectral brain MRIs in order to optimally separate tumour (including edema) from healthy brain tissues. A Bayesian framework then provides a coarse probabilistic texture-based segmentation of tumours (including edema) whose boundaries are then refined at the voxel level through a modified MRF framework that carefully separates the edema from the main tumour. This customised MRF is not only built on the voxel intensities and class labels as in traditional MRFs, but also models the intensity differences between neighbouring voxels in the likelihood model, along with employing a prior based on local tissue class transition probabilities. The second inference stage is shown to resolve local inhomogeneities and impose a smoothing constraint, while also maintaining the appropriate boundaries as supported by the local intensity difference observations. The method was trained and tested on the publicly available MICCAI 2012 Brain Tumour Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) Database [1] on both synthetic and clinical volumes (low grade and high grade tumours). Our method performs well compared to state-of-the-art techniques, outperforming the results of the top methods in cases of clinical high grade and low grade tumour core segmentation by 40% and 45% respectively.

This model can be used to support management decision making and to build predictions under uncertainty related to changes in people's behavior, the economic context, or the environment and policy. The presented model uses individuals' characteristics, transportation mode specifications, and data related to places of work and residence. The data set analyzed was taken from a survey conducted in 2007 and contains information on the daily mobility (e.g., from home to work) of individuals who either lived or worked in Luxembourg. Individual characteristics were extracted to relate daily mobility (journeys between home and work, in particular) to the characteristics of working individuals. Information about public transportation specification and some geographical particularities of residential areas and workplaces were used. Rates of successful prediction obtained by the ENN and several alternative approaches were compared by cross-validation. The results showed that the ENN was superior to the studied alternatives.

For the purpose of voltage control, such a system can be partitioned into smaller size control regions. This means adapting the traditional power system to a more reliable and smart system able to cope with random and sudden load variations and disturbances. This paper investigates a decentralized neural network secondary voltage control. A number of representative buses are labeled as pilot buses displaying the critical point for voltage control in each region. The control uses decentralized neural network controllers which are attached to these pilot buses to eliminate steady-state voltage violations. The methodology is applied to the IEEE 118-bus network. The results show the performance and ability of partitioning and neural network secondary voltage control to regulate the voltage and to avoid propagation of disturbances between regions.

Many of these diseases such as Parkinson's are due to degeneration of Dopaminergic neurons. Our ultimate goal is to develop an intelligent implantable CMOS neurotrophic factor delivery microsystem which can maintain therapeutic levels of chemical concentrations in the brain by protecting the healthy neurons and restoring damaged ones. The hybrid microsystem is composed of neural probes fitted with novel sensors that can sense micromolar concentration of neurotransmitters (dopamine) and embedded negative feedback circuits that control the flow of pharmacological agents in micro fluidic channels. Additionally MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) pumps connected to the probes to inject micromolar concentration of neurotrophic factors such as GDNF into the brain in order to protect and restore dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. The focus of this manuscript is on sensing, control and decision making circuitry. It consists of a current conveyer, a low noise low power amplifier, an integrator and a comparator with offset cancelation. Circuit is fabricated in CMOS 0.18 um with low power consumption of 921 nW while maintaining a bandwidth of 2.75K Hertz.

The proposed diagnosis system does not require image preprocessing and segmentation, leading to a simple implementation. The brain MRI is transformed first into a one-dimensional (1-D) signal for faster processing. Then, a three-component feature vector is extracted to characterize the 1-D signal's local and global fractal features. The features include Hurst's exponent and two results from detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA): the scaling exponent and the total fluctuation energy. The validation with ten normal brain MRIs and thirteen abnormal MRIs corresponding to AD led to 100% classification accuracy using support vector machines with a quadratic kernel. It is concluded that the proposed methodology can be as accurate as the best alternative approach while being simpler to implement.

They are used in applications ranging from caches and memory management in CPUs to database engines. In this work we study associative memories built on the maximum likelihood principle. We derive minimum residual error rates when the data stored comes from a uniform binary source. Second, we determine the minimum amount of memory required to store the same data. Finally, we bound the computational complexity for message retrieval. We then compare these bounds with two existing associative memory architectures: the celebrated Hopfield neural networks and a neural network architecture introduced more recently by Gripon and Berrou.

Application of inhibitory NIBS to improve recovery in left-handed patients has not yet been reported. Methods: A total of 29 right- handed subacute poststroke aphasics were randomized to receive either 10 sessions of SLT following 20 min of inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the contralesional IFG or 10 sessions of SLT following sham stimulation; 2 left-handers were treated according to the same protocol with real rTMS. Language activation patterns were assessed with positron emission tomography prior to and after the treatment; 95% confidence intervals for changes in language performance scores and the activated brain volumes in both hemispheres were derived from TMS- and sham-treated right-handed patients and compared to the same parameters in left-handers. Results: Right-handed patients treated with rTMS showed better recovery of language function in global aphasia test scores (t test, p < 0.002) as well as in picture-naming performance (ANOVA, p = 0.03) than sham-treated right-handers. In treated right-handers, a shift of activation to the ipsilesional hemisphere was observed, while sham-treated patients consolidated network activity in the contralesional hemisphere (repeated-measures ANOVA, p = 0.009). Both left-handed patients also improved, with 1 patient within the confidence limits of TMS-treated right-handers (23 points, 15.9-28.9) and the other patient within the limits of sham-treated subjects (8 points, 2.8-14.5). Both patients exhibited only a very small interhemispheric shift, much less than expected in TMS-treated right-handers, and more or less consolidated initially active networks in both hemispheres. Conclusion: Inhibitory rTMS over the nondominant IFG appears to be a safe and effective treatment for right-handed poststroke aphasics. In the 2 cases of left-handed aphasics no deterioration of language performance was observed with this protocol. However, therapeutic efficiency is less obvious and seems to be more related to the dominance pattern prior to the stroke than to the TMS intervention. (C) 2013 S.

Performance in those tasks may be affected by several variables, such as age, education and diseases. This study investigated whether aging, education, reading and writing frequency, performance in semantic judgment tasks and depression symptoms predict the performance in unconstrained, phonemic and semantic fluency tasks. This study sample comprised 260 healthy adults aged 19 to 75 years old. The Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression models were used for data analysis. The variables under analysis were associated in different ways and had different levels of contribution according to the type of verbal fluency task. Education had the greatest effect on verbal fluency tasks. There was a greater effect of age on semantic fluency than on phonemic tasks. The semantic judgment tasks predicted the verbal fluency performance alone or in combination with other variables. These findings corroborate the importance of education in cognition supporting the hypothesis of a cognitive reserve and confirming the contribution of lexical-semantic processing to verbal fluency.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress induces PRNP prion protein gene expression in breast cancer	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							MEDIATED CELL-DEATH; ANTI-BAX FUNCTION; GASTRIC-CANCER; ER STRESS; FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; HUMAN NEURONS; PRO-PRION; FACTOR-I	Introduction: High prion protein (PrP) levels are associated with breast, colon and gastric cancer resistance to treatment and with a poor prognosis for the patients. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism(s) regulating human PrP gene (PRNP) expression in cancers. Because endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with solid tumors, we investigated a possible regulation of PRNP gene expression by ER stress. Methods: Published microarray databases of breast cancer tissues and breast carcinoma cell lines were analyzed for PrP mRNA and ER stress marker immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) levels. Breast cancer tissue microarrays (TMA) were immunostained for BiP and PrP. Breast carcinoma MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HS578T and HCC1500 cells were treated with three different ER stressors - Brefeldin A, Tunicamycin, Thapsigargin - and levels of PrP mRNA or protein assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. A human PRNP promoter-luciferase reporter was used to assess transcriptional activation by ER stressors. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the ER stress response elements (ERSE). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses were done to identify the ER stress mediated transcriptional regulators. The role of cleaved activating transcription factor 6 alpha (Delta ATF6 alpha) and spliced X-box protein-1 (sXBP1) in PRNP gene expression was assessed with over-expression or silencing techniques. The role of PrP protection against ER stress was assessed with PrP siRNA and by using Prnp null cell lines. Results: We find that mRNA levels of BiP correlated with PrP transcript levels in breast cancer tissues and breast carcinoma cell lines. PrP mRNA levels were enriched in the basal subtype and were associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Higher PrP and BiP levels correlated with increasing tumor grade in TMA. ER stress was a positive regulator of PRNP gene transcription in MCF-7 cells and luciferase reporter assays identified one ER stress response element (ERSE) conserved among primates and rodents and three primate-specific ERSEs that regulated PRNP gene expression. Among the various transactivators of the ER stress-regulated unfolded protein response (UPR), ATF6 alpha and XBP1 transactivated PRNP gene expression, but the ability of these varied in different cell types. Functionally, PrP delayed ER stress-induced cell death. Conclusions: These results establish PRNP as a novel ER stress-regulated gene that could increase survival in breast cancers.

Recently, a new family of associative memories based on Clustered-Neural-Networks (CNNs) was introduced that can store many more messages than classical Hopfield-Neural Networks (HNNs). In this paper, we propose hardware architectures of such memories for partial or erroneous inputs. The proposed architectures eliminate winner-take-all modules and thus reduce the hardware complexity by consuming 65% fewer FPGA lookup tables and increase the operating frequency by approximately 1.9 times compared to that of previous work.

These advances have been motivated by and related to the optimization issues surrounding deep learning. Although recurrent networks are extremely powerful in what they can in principle represent in terms of modeling sequences, their training is plagued by two aspects of the same issue regarding the learning of long-term dependencies. Experiments reported here evaluate the use of clipping gradients, spanning longer time ranges with leaky integration, advanced momentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and encouraging sparser gradients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment. The experiments are performed on text and music data and show off the combined effects of these techniques in generally improving both training and test error.

Artificial Neural Network Modeling for Drug Dialyzability Prediction	JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; HEMODIALYSIS-PATIENTS; HUMAN PLASMA; IN-VITRO; DIALYSIS; REMOVAL; HYPERTENSION	Purpose. The purpose of this study was to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict drug removal during dialysis based on drug properties and dialysis conditions. Nine antihypertensive drugs were chosen as model for this study. Methods. Drugs were dissolved in a physiologic buffer and dialysed in vitro in different dialysis conditions (UFRmin/UFRmax, with/without BSA). Samples were taken at regular intervals and frozen at -20 degrees C until analysis. Extraction methods were developed for drugs that were dialysed with BSA in the buffer. Drug concentrations were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Dialysis clearances (CLDs) were calculated using the obtained drug concentrations. An ANOVA with Scheffe's pairwise adjustments was performed on the collected data in order to investigate the impact of drug plasma protein binding and ultrafiltration rate (UFR) on CLD. The software Neurosolutions (R) was used to build ANNs that would be able to predict drug CLD (output). The inputs consisted of dialysis UFR and the herein drug properties: molecular weight (MW), logD and plasma protein binding. Results. Observed CLDs were very high for the majority of the drugs studied. The addition of BSA in the physiologic buffer statistically significantly decreased CLD for carvedilol (p= 0.002) and labetalol (p<0.001), but made no significant difference for atenolol (p= 0.100). In contrast, varying UFR does not significantly affect CLD (p>0.025). Multiple ANNs were built and compared, the best model was a Jordan and Elman network which showed learning stability and good predictive results (MSEtesting = 129). Conclusion. In this study, we have developed an ANN-model which is able to predict drug removal during dialysis. Since experimental determination of all existing drug CLDs is not realistic, ANNs represent a promising tool for the prediction of drug CLD using drug properties and dialysis conditions.

A group of neuroimaging experts were assigned the task of reviewing and summarizing the literature on clinical and research applications of different neuroimaging modalities in cognitive disorders. This paper summarizes the literature and recommendations made to the conference regarding the role of several emerging neuroimaging modalities in cognitive disorders. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging are discussed in detail within this paper. Other emergent neuroimaging modalities such as positron emission tomography with novel ligands, high-field MRI, arterial spin labeling MRI and noncerebral blood flow single-photon emission computerized tomography are only discussed briefly. Neuroimaging modalities that were recommended at the CCCDTD4 for both clinical and research applications such as amyloid and flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, computerized tomography and structural MRI are discussed in a separate paper by the same authors. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed database including articles in English that involved human subjects and covered the period from the last CCCDTD publication (CCCDTD3; January 2006) until April 2012. Search terms included the name of the specific modality, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment. A separate search used the same parameters but was restricted to review articles to identify recent evidence-based reviews. Case studies and small case series were not included. Papers representing current evidence were selected, reviewed, and summarized, and the results were presented at the CCCDTD4 meeting with recommendations regarding the utility of various neuroimaging modalities in cognitive disorders. The evidence was graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine guidelines. Due to the limitations of current evidence, the neuroimaging modalities discussed in this paper were not recommended for clinical investigation of patients presenting with cognitive impairment. However, in the research setting, each modality provides a unique contribution to the understanding of basic mechanisms and neuropathological markers of cognitive disorders, to the identification of markers for early detection and for the risk of conversion to dementia in the at-risk populations, to the differentiation between different types of cognitive disorders, and to the identification of treatment targets and indicators of treatment response. In conclusion, for all of the neuroimaging modalities discussed in this paper, further studies are needed to establish diagnostic utility such as validity, reliability, and predictive and prognostic value. More multicenter studies are therefore needed with standardized image acquisition, experimental protocols, definition of the clinical population studied, larger numbers of participants, and longer duration of follow-up to allow generalizability of the results to the individual patient.

They regulate substrate function in a number of ways including protection from dephosphorylation, regulation of enzyme activity, formation of ternary complexes and sequestration. The diversity of 14-3-3 interacting partners thus enables 14-3-3 proteins to impact a wide variety of cellular and physiological processes. 14-3-3 proteins are broadly expressed in the brain, and clinical and experimental studies have implicated 14-3-3 proteins in neurodegenerative disease. A recurring theme is that 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in pathogenesis through regulating the subcellular localization of target proteins. Here, we review the evidence that 14-3-3 proteins regulate aspects of neurodegenerative disease with a focus on their protective roles against neurodegeneration.

A task irrelevant stimulus (cue) can reduce (Attention capture) or prolong (Inhibition of return) saccade reaction time to a subsequent target stimulus depending on the cue-target delay. Here we investigated the mechanisms that underlie the sensory-based account of AC/IOR by manipulating the visual processing stage where the cue and target interact. In Experiment 1, liquid crystal shutter goggles were used to test whether AC/IOR occur at a monocular versus binocular processing stage (before versus after signals from both eyes converge). In Experiment 2, we tested whether visual orientation selective mechanisms are critical for AC/IOR by using oriented "Gabor" stimuli. We found that the magnitude of AC and IOR was not different between monocular and interocular viewing conditions, or between iso- and ortho-oriented cue-target interactions. The results suggest that the visual mechanisms that contribute to AC/IOR arise at an orientation-independent binocular processing stage.

Methods: In eight adult macaque monkeys subjected to a restricted chemical lesion of the hand area in the primary motor cortex (M1), motor maps were established using intracortical micro-stimulation (ICMS) techniques. The monkeys were subdivided into five animals without treatment, whereas three monkeys received an anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment. Results: Following permanent M1 injury, the lesion territory became largely non micro-excitable several months post-lesion, in spite of some recovery of hand function. Few sites within the lesion territory remained excitable, though irrespective to the degree of functional recovery. Around the lesion in M1, there was no reallocation of proximal shoulder/arm territories into distal hand functions. However, ICMS delivered at supra-threshold intensities in these proximal territories elicited digit movements. Post-lesion ICMS thresholds to elicit movements of forelimb muscle territories increased, independently from the degree of functional recovery. Further behavioural evidence for an enhancement of functional recovery promoted by the anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment is provided. Conclusion: The degree of functional recovery is not related to a reorganization of motor maps within, and in the vicinity of, a M1 lesion.

White Matter Injury and Autistic-Like Behavior Predominantly Affecting Male Rat Offspring Exposed to Group B Streptococcal Maternal Inflammation	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Autism; Group B streptococcus; Dysmyelination; Gestational inflammation	EXTREMELY PRETERM INFANTS; IMMUNE ACTIVATION; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH; PREPULSE INHIBITION; PRENATAL INFECTION; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; CEREBRAL-PALSY; MOTOR DEFICITS; ANIMAL-MODEL	The impact of the group B streptococcus (GBS)-induced maternal inflammation on offspring's brain has not yet been investigated despite GBS being one of the most frequent bacteria colonizing or infecting pregnant women. According to our hypothesis GBS-induced maternal immune activation plays a role in offspring perinatal brain damage and subsequent neurodisabilities such as autism. Using a new preclinical rat model of maternal inflammation triggered by inactivated GBS, we demonstrated placental, neuropathological and behavioral impacts on offspring. GBS-exposed placentas presented cystic lesions and polymorphonuclear infiltration located within the decidual/maternal side of the placenta, contrasting with macrophagic infiltration and necrotic areas located in the labyrinth/fetal compartment of the placenta after lipopolysaccharide-induced maternal inflammation. Brain damage featured lateral ventricles widening, predominately in the male, reduction of periventricular external capsules thickness, oligodendrocyte loss, and disorganization of frontoparietal subcortical tissue with no glial proliferation. Autistic hallmarks were found in offspring exposed to GBS, namely deficits in motor behavior, social and communicative impairments, i.e. profound defects in the integration and response to both acoustic and chemical signals that are predominant modes of communication in rats. Surprisingly, only male offspring were affected by these combined autistic-like traits. Our results show for the first time that materno-fetal inflammatory response to GBS plays a role in the induction of placental and cerebral insults, remarkably recapitulating cardinal features of human autism such as gender dichotomy and neurobehavioral traits. Unlike other models of prenatal inflammatory brain damage (induced by viral/toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) or Gram-negative/TLR4), maternal inflammation resulting from GBS/TLR2 interactions induced a distinctive pattern of chorioamnionitis and cerebral injuries. These results also provide important evidence that beyond genetic influences, modifiable environmental factors play a role in both the occurrence of autism and its gender imbalance. (C) 2013 S.

The ductal origin of structural and functional heterogeneity between pancreatic islets	PROGRESS IN HISTOCHEMISTRY AND CYTOCHEMISTRY			English	Review							BETA-CELL MASS; PERSISTENT HYPERINSULINEMIC HYPOGLYCEMIA; SCANNING-ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; DEVELOPING MOUSE PANCREAS; INSULIN-PRODUCING CELLS; HUMAN FETAL PANCREAS; Y GASTRIC BYPASS; COMPLEX TYPE-I; ENDOCRINE PANCREAS; RAT PANCREAS	Islets form in the pancreas after the first endocrine cells have arisen as either single cells or small cell clusters in the epithelial cords. These cords constitute the developing pancreas in one of its earliest recognizable stages. Islet formation begins at the time the cords transform into a branching ductal system, continues while the ductal system expands, and finally stops before the exocrine tissue of ducts and acini reaches its final expansion. Thus, islets continuously arise from founder cells located in the branching and ramifying ducts. Islets arising from proximal duct cells locate between the exocrine lobules, develop strong autonomic and sensory innervations, and pass their blood to efferent veins (insulo-venous efferent system). Islets arising from cells of more distal ducts locate within the exocrine lobules, respond to nerve impulses ending at neighbouring blood vessels, and pass their blood to the surrounding acini (insulo-acinar portal system). Consequently, the section of the ductal system from which an islet arises determines to a large extent its future neighbouring tissue, architecture, properties, and functions. We note that islets interlobular in position are frequently found in rodents (rats and mice), whereas intralobularly-located, peripheral duct islets prevail in humans and cattle. Also, we expound on bovine foetal Laguesse islets as a prominent foetal type of type 1 interlobular neuro-insular complexes, similar to neuro-insular associations frequently found in rodents. Finally, we consider the probable physiological and pathophysiological implications of the different islet positions within and between species. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The active component of turmeric, curcumin, has caught attention as a potential treatment for diabetes and its complications primarily because it is a relatively safe and inexpensive drug that reduces glycemia and hyperlipidemia in rodent models of diabetes. Here, we review the recent literature on the applications of curcumin for glycemia and diabetes-related liver disorders, adipocyte dysfunction, neuropathy, nephropathy, vascular diseases, pancreatic disorders, and other complications, and we also discuss its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The applications of additional curcuminoid compounds for diabetes prevention and treatment are also included in this paper. Finally, we mention the approaches that are currently being sought to generate a "super curcumin" through improvement of the bioavailability to bring this promising natural product to the forefront of diabetes therapeutics.

Arm-trunk coordination as a measure of vestibulospinal efficiency	JOURNAL OF VESTIBULAR RESEARCH-EQUILIBRIUM & ORIENTATION			English	Article						Motor control; vestibular deficiency; rehabilitation; arm-trunk coordination; measurement	VESTIBULAR DYSFUNCTION; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; POINTING MOVEMENTS; ACOUSTIC NEUROMA; CHILDREN; SYSTEM; REHABILITATION; COMPENSATION; PRESERVATION; DISORDERS	When arm and trunk segments are involved in reaching for objects within arm's reach, vestibulospinal pathways compensate for trunk motion influence on arm movement. This compensatory arm-trunk synergy is characterised by a gain coefficient of 0 to 1. Vestibular patients have less efficient arm-trunk synergies and lower gains. To assess the clinical usefulness of the gain measure, we used a portable ultrasound-based device to characterize arm-trunk coordination deficits in vestibular patients. Arm-trunk coordination without vision was measured in a Stationary Hand Task where hand position was maintained during trunk movement, and a Reaching Task with and without trunk motion. Twenty unilateral vestibular patients and 16 controls participated. For the Stationary Hand task, patient gains ranged from g = 0.94 (good compensation) to 0.31 (poor compensation) and, on average, were lower than in controls (patients: 0.67 +/- 0.19; controls: 0.85 +/- 0.07; p < 0.01). Gains were significantly correlated with clinical tests (Sensory Organization; r = 0.62, p < 0.01, Foam Romberg Eyes Closed; r = 0.65, p < 0.01). For the Reaching Task, blocking trunk movement during reaching modified hand position significantly more in patients (8.2 +/- 4.3 cm) compared to controls (4.5 +/- 1.7 cm, p < 0.02) and the amount of hand position deviation was correlated with the degree of vestibular loss in a sub-group (n = 14) of patients. Measurement of the Stationary Task arm-trunk gain and hand deviations during the Reaching Task can help characterize sensorimotor problems in vestibular-deficient patients and track recovery following therapeutic interventions. The ultrasound-based portable device is suitable for measuring vestibulospinal deficits in arm-trunk coordination in a clinical setting.

The proposed architecture greatly increases memory efficiency by storing associations between IP addresses and their output rules instead of storing these data themselves. The rules can be determined by simple hardware using a few associations read from SRAMs, eliminating a power-hungry search of input addresses in TCAMs. The proposed hardware that stores 100,000 144-bit entries is evaluated under TSMC 65nm CMOS technology. The dynamic power dissipation and the area of the proposed hardware are 4.6% and 30.6% of a traditional TCAM, respectively while maintaining comparable throughput.

Hence rate estimators that can account for such dependency, although seemingly more difficult to formulate, could provide more accurate results. In this paper a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator for an inhomogeneous Poisson process is modified to account for an absolute refractory period in the spike sequence. The proposed estimator treats the refractory period as a nuisance parameter and maximizes the profile likelihood of the stimulus. Through computer simulations we show that by exploiting the refractory phenomenon, the estimator can achieve better performance than the Poisson estimator for moderate to high firing rates. Furthermore, we show that the results provided by this estimator yield an improved goodness of fit to real data when compared to the Poisson estimator.

The computerized automation of CBC has been a challenging problem in medical diagnostics. In this work we describe a subcomponent system for the CBC to perform the automatic classification of WBC cells into one of five WBC types in low resolution cytological images. We describe feature extraction and consider three classifiers: a support vector machine (SVM) using standard intensity and histogram features, an SVM with features extracted by a kernel principal component analysis of the intensity and histogram features, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) which takes the entire image as input. The proposed classifiers were compared through experiments conducted on low resolution cytological images of normal blood smears. The best results were obtained with the CNN solution with recognition rates either higher or comparable to the SVM-based classifiers for all five types of WBCs.

The vervet monkey (also called the African green monkey) is a widely used NHP model that has unique value for genetic and genomic investigations of traits relevant to human diseases. This article describes the phylogeny and population history of the vervet monkey and summarizes the use of both captive and wild vervet monkeys in biomedical research. It also discusses the effort of an international collaboration to develop the vervet monkey as the most comprehensively phenotypically and genomically characterized NHP, a process that will enable the scientific community to employ this model for systems biology investigations.

J	Trent-von Haesler, N; Beauregard, M				Trent-von Haesler, Natalie; Beauregard, Mario			Near-death experiences in cardiac arrest: implications for the concept of non-local mind	REVISTA DE PSIQUIATRIA CLINICA			Portuguese	Article						Near-death experiences; cardiac arrest; out-of-body experiences; brain; non-local mind	CEREBRAL RESUSCITATION; MYSTICAL EXPERIENCES; SURVIVORS; CONSCIOUSNESS; DANGER	Background: Near-death experiences (NDE) are vivid, realistic, and often deeply life-changing experiences occurring to people who have been physiologically or psychologically close to death. NDEs sometimes occur during cardiac arrest, in the absence of recordable brain activity. Objective: To review prospective studies of cardiac arrest-induced NDEs and examine the implications of these studies for the concept of non-local mind. Method: PubMed was the main database used for this review. Key search terms included "cardiac arrest", "near-death experiences", "physiology of near-death experience", and "veridical out-of-body-experiences". Results: Several prospective studies show an average incidence of cardiac arrest-induced NDE of 10%-20%, irrespective of sociodemo-graphic status, sex, religion, or any consistent medical, physiological, or pharmacological measures. NDErs are more likely than non-NDErs to have positive life changes lasting many years following the experience. Discussion: Physicalist theories of the mind cannot explain how NDErs can experience - while their hearts are stopped and brain activity is seemingly absent - vivid and complex thoughts, and acquire veridical information about objects or events remote from their bodies. NDE in cardiac arrest suggest that mind is non-local, i.e. it is not generated by the brain, and it is not confined to the brain and the body.

The methods to obtain relevant studies for review included a MEDLINE search and a review of studies in English, along with checking reference lists of articles. The leading explanatory models of TD development include dopamine receptor supersensitivity, GABA depletion, cholinergic deficiency, neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, changes in synaptic plasticity, and defective neuroadaptive signaling. As such, a wide range of treatment options are available. To provide a complete summary of choices we review atypical antipsychotics along with resveratrol, botulinum toxin, Ginkgo biloba, tetrabenazine, clonazepam, melatonin, essential fatty acids, zonisamide, levetiracetam, branched-chain amino acids, drug combinations, and invasive surgical treatments. There is currently no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for TD; however, prudent use of atypical antipsychotics with routine monitoring remain the cornerstone of therapy, with experimental treatment options available for further management.

Septins, a conserved family of membrane and cytoskeletal interacting GTPases, form intracellular diffusion barriers during cell division and neurite extension and are expressed in myelinating cells. Septins, particularly septin 7 (Sept7), the central constituent of septin polymers, are associated with the cytoplasmic channels of myelinating cells. Here we show that Schwann cells deprived of Sept7 fail to wrap around axons from dorsal root ganglion neurons and exhibit disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Likewise, Sept7 distribution is dependent on microfilament but not microtubule organization.

Recently, however, substantial evidence has emerged for cerebellar involvement. While the absence of neurological "cerebellar signs" in most dystonia patients may be considered at least provoking, there are more subtle indications of cerebellar dysfunction in complex, demanding tasks. Specifically, given the role of the cerebellum in the neural representation of time, in the millisecond range, dysfunction to this structure is considered to be of greater importance than dysfunction of the basal ganglia. In the current study, we investigated the performance of cervical dystonia patients on a computer task known to engage the cerebellum, namely, the interception of a moving target with changing parameters (speed, acceleration, and angle) with a simple response (pushing a button). The cervical dystonia patients achieved significantly worse results than a sample of healthy controls. Our results suggest that the cervical dystonia patients are impaired at integrating incoming visual information with motor responses during the prediction of upcoming actions, an impairment we interpret as evidence of cerebellar dysfunction.

The main problem being that the pixel size (less than a meter) is too small as compared to the typical object size (100s of meters) and contains too little contextual information to accurately distinguish complex settlement types. One way to alleviate this problem is to consider a bigger window or patch/segment consisting a group of adjacent pixels which offers better spatial context than a single pixel. Unfortunately, this makes per-pixel based classification schemes ineffective. In this work, we look at a new class of machine learning approaches, called multi-instance learning, where instead of assigning class labels to individual instances (pixels), a label is assigned to the bag (all pixels in a window or segment). We applied this multi-instance learning approach for identifying two important urban patterns, namely formal and informal settlements. Experimental evaluation shows the better performance of multi-instance learning over several well-known single-instance classification schemes.

Despite tremendous efforts by the scientific community, the AD drug development pipeline remains extremely limited. Animal models of disease are a cornerstone of any drug development program and should be as relevant as possible to the disease, recapitulating the disease phenotype with high fidelity, to meaningfully contribute to the development of a successful therapeutic agent. Over the past two decades, transgenic models of AD based on the known genetic origins of familial AD have significantly contributed to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of the disease. These models were extensively used in AD drug development. The numerous reported failures of new treatments for AD in clinical trials indicate that the use of genetic models of AD may not represent the complete picture of AD in humans and that other types of animal models relevant to the sporadic form of the disease, which represents 95% of AD cases, should be developed. In this review, we will discuss the evolution of non-transgenic rat models of AD and how these models may open new avenues for drug development.

First, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is applied to brain MR images to obtain high frequency intrinsic mode functions (IMF) from which features are extracted. Then, an entropy-based selection process is used to identify the most informative and non redundant features from each IMF before classification by support vector machines (SVM). The validation of the approach with a MR image database consisting of Alzheimer's disease, glioma, herpes encephalitis, metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, multiple sclerosis, and normal condition shows its effectiveness as well as slightly better classification efficiency in comparison to using discrete wavelet transform-based alternatives. However, the EMD approach is substantially more time consuming.

The HomER graphical user interface is used to display the NIRS data, FastICA is updated to reduce data dimension and combined Wavelet & Pca method is developed to denoise NIRS signals. These signals include several types of noise spread from low to high frequencies such as respiratory interference frequency band of 0.1-0.3Hz, NIRS Mayer wave which is about 0.1Hz, cardiac interference frequency band which is 0.8-2.0Hz, artifacts from head and facial motions, and high frequency noise generated from electronic components. Wavelet & Pca is an efficient method to reduce biological noise, motion artifact and high-frequency noise. The applied processing technique consists of adaptively modifying the wavelet coefficients based on the degree of noise contaminating the processed NIRS signal. This is done subsequently to signal pre-processing by reducing data dimension using the FastICA method. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated by testing it on experimental fNIRS data collected from 47 subjects. Preliminary results, through signal-to-noise ratio and correlation indicators show that the technique reduces noise and improves the quality of the acquired NIRS signals and its corresponding analysis.

In order to reduce the power consumption and after-pulsing, and also increasing the sensitivity and fill factor, the photon-counting front-end circuitry is integrated on-chip with APD using standard CMOS technology. This miniaturized system offers an ultra-fast quench-rest time (similar to few ns) with a low-power consumption (< 1mW).

J	Koski, L				Koski, Lisa			Validity and Applications of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment for the Assessment of Vascular Cognitive Impairment	CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES			English	Review						Review; Cognitive screening; Stroke; Dementia; Mild cognitive impairment	MENTAL-STATE-EXAMINATION; ANEURYSMAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; STROKE-CANADIAN STROKE; BRIEF SCREENING TOOL; ASSESSMENT MOCA; OLDER-ADULTS; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION; HARMONIZATION STANDARDS; NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS; ASSESSMENT SUPERIOR	Cognitive impairment is common among patients with stroke or other cerebrovascular disease and influences long-term outcome, including occupational functioning. Recognition and monitoring of mild cognitive impairment is thus essential to good patient care. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been suggested as a brief screening test of vascular cognitive impairment. This paper presents a critical review of the research literature evaluating the validity and utility of this test with the aim of informing future clinical and research practice. A total of 30 papers employing the MoCA in the context of cerebrovascular disease were identified. Reporting of the methods and results of such studies tended to fall short of the established reporting guidelines. Under-specification of the exclusion criteria applied and their impact make it difficult to assess the potential impact of sampling bias and loss to follow-up. Nevertheless, content validity evidence suggests that the MoCA covers most of the domains that represent cognitive impairment in cerebrovascular disease, with mixed evidence for its preferential sensitivity to the type of cognitive impairment encountered in the context of vascular disease. Evidence clearly supports the need to establish norms and cut-offs for the MoCA that are culturally appropriate and that are matched to the range of cognitive impairment that is present in the population being assessed. Recent modifications of the MoCA have been developed for assessing patients with visual impairment or restricted mobility, which may reduce the impact of 'untestability' on cognitive screening in the clinic or research context. The MoCA correlates well with other measures of cognitive and functional abilities in patients with cerebrovascular disease, and may also predict future response to rehabilitation and long-term occupational outcome. Further research is needed to provide evidence for the validity of the MoCA in longitudinal studies. However, it compares favourably to the Mini Mental State Examination as a screening test that is sensitive to the milder forms of cognitive impairment that often accompany cerebrovascular disease.

Associations between Pituitary Imaging Abnormalities and Clinical and Biochemical Phenotypes in Children with Congenital Growth Hormone Deficiency: Data from an International Observational Study	HORMONE RESEARCH IN PAEDIATRICS			English	Article						Growth hormone deficiency; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pituitary imaging abnormality; Septo-optic dysplasia; Ectopic posterior pituitary; Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies; Growth hormone therapy	GH DEFICIENCY; UNITED-STATES; HYPOPITUITARISM; GLAND; MUTATIONS; CHILDHOOD; SOCIETY; HEIGHT; ADOLESCENCE; GUIDELINES	Background/Aims: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to investigate the etiology of growth hormone deficiency (GHD). This study examined relationships between MRI findings and clinical/hormonal phenotypes in children with GHD in the observational Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study, GeNeSIS. Methods: Clinical presentation, hormonal status and first-year GH response were compared between patients with pituitary imaging abnormalities (n = 1,071), patients with mutations in genes involved in pituitary development/GH secretion (n = 120) and patients with idiopathic GHD (n = 7,039). Results: Patients with hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities had more severe phenotypes than patients with idiopathic GHD. Additional hormonal deficiencies were found in 35% of patients with structural abnormalities (thyroid-stimulating hormone > adrenocorticotropic hormone > luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone > antidiuretic hormone), most frequently in patients with septo-optic dysplasia (SOD). Patients with the triad [ectopic posterior pituitary (EPP), pituitary aplasia/hypoplasia and stalk defects] had a more severe phenotype and better response to GH treatment than patients with isolated abnormalities. The sex ratio was approximately equal for patients with SOD, but there was a significantly higher proportion of males (approximately 70%) in the EPP, pituitary hypoplasia, stalk defects, and triad categories. Conclusion: This large, international database demonstrates the value of classification of GH-deficient patients by the presence and type of hypothalamic-pituitary imaging abnormalities. This information may assist family counseling and patient management. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

Meanwhile, neuroscientists suggest that episodic memory, through autonoetic consciousness, is crucially involved in the elaboration of the Self and subjective experience. This research empirically investigates the relationship between the quality of mentalization and the efficacy of autobiographical recall, and considers childhood trauma and psychopathology as possible related factors. Thirty participants presenting with either high or low mentalization profiles according to the Mental States Rating Systems (MSRS) were submitted to the TEMPau, a semi-structured interview designed to assess the quality of autobiographical recall from several criteria (episodicity, self-perspective and consciousness). Childhood trauma was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SCID-II) were used to assess global symptomatology and Axis-II disorders respectively. As expected, levels of mentalization are related to higher levels of childhood abuse (emotional, physical and sexual) and symptomatology (SCL-90-R Global Severity Index). However, contrary to our expectation, better autobiographical memory is associated with poor mentalization profiles, although spontaneity of recall is less efficient in those subjects. No significant relation was found between Axis-II disorders and traits, and other clinical variables.

Neural network approach to sizing an electrical machine	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Design; Electrical machines; Sizing; Neural networks; Electrical equipment	ELECTROMAGNETIC DEVICES; DESIGN	Purpose - The conventional starting point for the design of an electrical machine (or any low-frequency electromagnetic device) is known as "sizing". In this process, a simple magnetic circuit is used to estimate the main geometric parameters. This does not work for many devices, particularly where eddy currents and non-linearity dominate. The purpose of this paper is to investigate an approach using a neural network trained on a large database of existing designs as a general sizing system. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on a combination of a radial basis function neural network and a database of stored performances of electrical machines. The network is trained based on a set of typical performance requirements for a machines design problem. The resulting design is analyzed using finite elements to determine if the design performance is acceptable. Findings - The number of neurons in the network was varied to determine the approximation and generalization capabilities. The finite element analysis showed that the network produced initial design parameters which resulted in an appropriate performance. Research limitations/implications - The research has looked at only one class of machine. Further work is needed on a range of machines to determine how effective the approach can be. Practical implications - The approach can provide a good initial design and thus can reduce overall design time significantly. Originality/value - The paper proposes a novel, fast and effective generalized approach to sizing low frequency electromagnetic devices.

Objectives: We tested this prediction by continuously monitoring real-time changes in neurochemical levels over periods of several days in animals exposed to a toxin known to cause Parkinsonian symptoms. Methods: Nitric oxide (NO) sensors were implanted in the brains of freely moving rats and the NO levels continuously recorded while the animals were exposed to paraquat (PQ) injections of various amounts and frequencies. Results: Long-term, real-time measurement of NO in a cohort of animals showed systematic switching in levels when PQ injections of sufficient size and frequency were administered. The experimental observations of changes in NO imply a corresponding switching in endogenous ROS levels and support theoretical predictions of an irreversible change to damagingly high levels of endogenous ROS when PD risks are sufficiently large. Conclusions: Our current results only consider one form of PD risk, however, we are sufficiently confident in them to conclude that: (i) continuous long-term measurement of neurochemical dynamics provide a novel way to measure the temporal change and system dynamics which determine Parkinsonian damage, and (ii) the bistable feedback switching predicted by mathematical modelling seems to exist and that a deeper analysis of its characteristics would provide a way of understanding the pathogenic mechanisms that initiate Parkinsonian cell damage.

The pontine nuclei exhibit a transitory patchy pattern not predicted from the uniform histology and reminiscent of the corpus striatum; synaptic vesicle reactivity appears at 20 weeks and is uniform by 34 weeks. In the cerebellar cortex, the vermis matures sooner than the cerebellar hemispheres and the paravermal portions earlier than the lateral folia. The earliest synapses occur around the somata of Purkinje neurons and later in the internal granular layer, but synaptic glomeruli are not well formed until after 26 weeks. The normal patterns here shown, together with earlier data of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle, provide controls for the interpretation of synaptic delay or precociousness and other pathological patterns in malformations, genetic/metabolic conditions and prenatal acquired insults affecting the human foetus.

It remains unclear which domain-specific cognitive functions are affected with hypovitaminosis D. Objective: To systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations with episodic memory and executive functions in adults. Methods: A Medline and PsycINFO (R) libraries search was conducted on May 2012, with no limit of date, using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms "Vitamin D" OR "Hydroxycholecalciferols" combined with the MeSH terms "Memory" OR "Memory Disorders" OR "Executive Function" OR "Attention" OR "Cognition" OR "Cognition disorders" OR "Dementia" OR "Alzheimer disease" OR "Neuropsychological Tests". Fixed-effects meta-analysis was performed from 12 eligible studies using an inverse-variance method. Results: Of the 285 selected studies, 14 observational studies (including 3 prospective cohort studies) and 3 interventional studies met the selection criteria. All were of good quality. The number of participants ranged from 44-5,692 community-dwellers (0-100% women). In the pooled analysis, although episodic memory disorders showed only modest association with lower 25OHD concentrations (summary effect size of the difference (ES) =-0.09 [95% CI:-0.16;-0.03]), associations of greater magnitude were found with executive dysfunctions (processing speed: mean difference of Trail Making Test (TMT)-A score = 4.0 [95% CI: 1.20;6.83]; mental shifting: mean difference of TMT-B score = 12.47 [95% CI: 6.78; 18.16]; information updating tests: ES =-0.31 [95% CI:-0.5;-0.09]). The pooled risk of incident decline of TMT-B score was OR = 1.25 [95% CI: 1.05; 1.48] in case of initial lower 25OHD concentrations. Vitamin D repletion resulted in improved executive functions (ES =-0.50 [95% CI:-0.69;-0.32] for before-and-after comparison), but exhibited no difference with control groups (ES = 0.14 [95% CI:-0.04; 0.32] for between-group comparison after intervention). Conclusion: Lower serum 25OHD concentrations predict executive dysfunctions, especially on mental shifting, information updating and processing speed. The association with episodic memory remains uncertain.

DCC Expression by Neurons Regulates Synaptic Plasticity in the Adult Brain	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							CYCLASE-ACTIVATING POLYPEPTIDE; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NMDA RECEPTORS; PROTEIN-KINASE; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; MESSENGER-RNA; AXON GUIDANCE; RAT-BRAIN	The transmembrane protein deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and its ligand, netrin-1, regulate synaptogenesis during development, but their function in the mature central nervous system is unknown. Given that DCC promotes cell-cell adhesion, is expressed by neurons, and activates proteins that signal at synapses, we hypothesized that DCC expression by neurons regulates synaptic function and plasticity in the adult brain. We report that DCC is enriched in dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in wild-type mice, and we demonstrate that selective deletion of DCC from neurons in the adult forebrain results in the loss of long-term potentiation (LTP), intact long-term depression, shorter dendritic spines, and impaired spatial and recognition memory. LTP induction requires Src activation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function. DCC deletion severely reduced Src activation. We demonstrate that enhancing NMDAR function or activating Src rescues LTP in the absence of DCC.

Methods: A scoping review of peer-reviewed studies published from 1990 to 2011 was performed. Two independent reviewers selected studies based on a systematic procedure. Inclusion criteria for studies were: participants with a disability, aged 5-21 years, whose environment was examined in relation to participation in out-of-school activities. Data were organized and synthesized based on environmental domains within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF): Natural Environment/Products and Technology; Support and Relationships; Attitudes; and Services, Systems and Policies. Results: Searching identified 1232 articles and 31 met the inclusion criteria. Each domain of the environment within the ICF influenced participation as a facilitator and/or barrier. The most common facilitators involved social support of family and friends and geographic location. The most common barriers included attitudes, physical environment, transportation, policies and the lack of support from staff and service providers. Conclusions: Knowledge derived from this review can assist practitioners in addressing the specific environmental domains that influence children's participation. Such awareness can also foster new research questions and assist policy makers in identifying the factors influencing participation.

Methods: A case study method was used with qualitative interviews as the primary data source. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted three times over the course of a 12-week intensive interdisciplinary occupational rehabilitation program with one interview 1 month following discharge. To capture changes in rehabilitation trajectories, data analysis employed a narrative approach informed by Bury (progression, regression, and stability) and Frank's (chaos, restitution, and quest) approaches. Results: Sixteen patients (10 men and 6 women) were disabled as a result of persistent pain and impairment from a variety of work injuries participated. Progression/restitution narratives were characterized by the transformation of bone and nerve problems to include soft tissue elements. These participants expanded their scope of injury representations and appraisal to include neurobiological aspects of chronic pain and dimensions of psychosocial well-being, and linked diagnostic representations to self-management strategies in a functional manner. Conclusion: Body representations of injury morphology and pain mechanisms are important objects of fear and acceptance for injury recovery. Active strategies that encourage a "hands on" understanding of diagnosis may prove most effective in treating persistent pain.	[O'Hagan, F.

Reassessment of the Normal Fetal Cisterna Magna during Gestation and an Alternative Approach to the Definition of Cisterna Magna Dilatation	FETAL DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY			English	Article						Cistern magna; Mega cisterna magna; Neurodevelopment; Fetal anomalies; Fetal ultrasound; Prenatal diagnosis	DANDY-WALKER MALFORMATION; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; POSTERIOR-FOSSA; SONOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENT; PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS; TRISOMY-18; ABNORMALITIES; FETUSES; ENLARGEMENT; ANOMALIES	Introduction: Cisterna magna (CM) measurement constitutes part of the sonographic assessment of the posterior fossa. CM enlargement (ECM) is defined as a measurement exceeding 10 mm, although it has previously been noted that the CM varies in size with gestation. Existing data do not appear to reflect observations regarding CM biometry within our population and this study was therefore undertaken in order to re-evaluate CM biometry. Materials and Methods: Data from 4,750 normal pregnancies between 15 and 32 weeks of gestation were collected and used to construct a reference range for the CM. Results: Regression analysis was used to model CM across gestational age and thereby define the upper limits for normal CM measurements across gestation. The CM increases with gestation. These data suggest that a 10-mm cut-off underestimates ECM, notably in the gestational age period below 24 weeks, whilst overestimating isolated ECM beyond this. Differences in CM measurements between genders were confirmed (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Defining ECM based upon a cutoff of 10 mm across all gestations may be inappropriate given the variation observed with gestational age. More accurate identification of fetuses with, in particular, isolated ECM may facilitate more precise evaluation of the clinical significance of this finding. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

To reconstruct the genome composition of metazoan ancestors, we sequenced the genome and transcriptome of the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, a close relative of metazoans that forms rosette-shaped colonies of cells. Results: A comparison of the 55 Mb S. rosetta genome with genomes from diverse opisthokonts suggests that the origin of metazoans was preceded by a period of dynamic gene gain and loss. The S. rosetta genome encodes homologs of cell adhesion, neuropeptide, and glycosphingolipid metabolism genes previously found only in metazoans and expands the repertoire of genes inferred to have been present in the progenitors of metazoans and choanoflagellates. Transcriptome analysis revealed that all four S. rosetta septins are upregulated in colonies relative to single cells, suggesting that these conserved cytokinesis proteins may regulate incomplete cytokinesis during colony development. Furthermore, genes shared exclusively by metazoans and choanoflagellates were disproportionately upregulated in colonies and the single cells from which they develop. Conclusions: The S. rosetta genome sequence refines the catalog of metazoan-specific genes while also extending the evolutionary history of certain gene families that are central to metazoan biology. Transcriptome data suggest that conserved cytokinesis genes, including septins, may contribute to S. rosetta colony formation and indicate that the initiation of colony development may preferentially draw upon genes shared with metazoans, while later stages of colony maturation are likely regulated by genes unique to S. rosetta.

While a number of mechanisms have been implicated in this complex disease, oxidative stress remains one of the earliest and strongest events related to disease progression. However, the mechanism that links oxidative stress and cognitive decline remains elusive. Here, we propose that phosphorylated tau protein could be playing the role of potential connector and, therefore, that a combined therapy involving antioxidants and check points for synaptic plasticity during early stages of the disease could become a viable therapeutic option for AD treatment.

Immunocompetent cell counts and cytokine levels present variations according to the time of day and the sleep-wake cycle. Moreover, different immune cell types, such as macrophages, natural killer cells, and lymphocytes, contain a circadian molecular clockwork. The biological clocks intrinsic to immune cells and lymphoid organs, together with inputs from the central pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nuclei via humoral and neural pathways, regulate the function of cells of the immune system, including their response to signals and their effector functions. Consequences of this include, for example, the daily variation in the response to an immune challenge (e. g., bacterial endotoxin injection) and the circadian control of allergic reactions. The circadian-immune connection is bidirectional, because in addition to this circadian control of immune functions, immune challenges and immune mediators (e. g., cytokines) were shown to have strong effects on circadian rhythms at the molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. This tight crosstalk between the circadian and immune systems has wide-ranging implications for disease, as shown by the higher incidence of cancer and the exacerbation of autoimmune symptoms upon circadian disruption.

The first section discusses the multiple meanings of culture in the contemporary world and their relevance for understanding mental health and illness. The next section considers methodological strategies for unpacking the concept of culture and studying the impact of cultural variables, processes and contexts. Multiple methods are needed to address the many different components or dimensions of cultural identity and experience that constitute local worlds, ways of life or systems of knowledge. Quantitative and observational methods of clinical epidemiology and experimental science as well as qualitative ethnographic methods are needed to capture crucial aspects of culture as systems of meaning and practice. Emerging issues in cultural psychiatric research include: cultural variations in illness experience and expression; the situated nature of cognition and emotion; cultural configurations of self and personhood; concepts of mental disorder and mental health literacy; and the prospect of ecosocial models of health and culturally based interventions. The conclusion considers the implications of the emerging perspectives from cultural neuroscience for psychiatric theory and practice. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

A structured search of five databases resulted in 16 articles included in this review. Nearly all were classified as Level 4 evidence using the updated Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Balance abilities have been investigated solely in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or central nervous system tumours. The literature tends to support the idea that survivors present with balance difficulties but the results need to be closely scrutinised. Several studies report results using the same experimental group, while other studies use balance outcome measures that have not had their psychometric properties assessed with this population. There are also few studies that evaluate dynamic balance abilities in survivors of paediatric cancers, which may be more influential on functional tasks. Furthermore, very few of the included studies investigate how the found balance deficits affect this population's daily lives, which would be necessary in order to determine if intervention should be geared towards this area. Directions for future research should also include multi-centred, clinically oriented trials to evaluate balance abilities in survivors of childhood cancers compared with healthy control subjects in order to strengthen the literature.

ADAPT Res Grp	Screening by Telephone in the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; dementia; geriatric assessment; memory disorders; mild cognitive impairment; neuropsychology; prodromal period; telephone	COGNITIVE STATUS TICS; MINI-MENTAL STATE; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; DEMENTIA; INTERVIEW; VALIDATION; PERFORMANCE; MEMORY; VALIDITY; VERSION	Compared with in-person assessment methods, telephone screening for dementia and other cognitive syndromes may improve efficiency of large population studies or prevention trials. We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-Inflammatory Prevention Trial to compare performance of a four-test Telephone Assessment Battery (TAB) that included the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) to that of a traditional in-person Cognitive Assessment Battery. Among 1,548 elderly participants with valid telephone and in-person screening results obtained within 90 days of each other, 225 persons were referred for a full cognitive diagnostic evaluation that was completed within six months of screening. Drawing on results from this panel of 225 individuals, we used the Capture-Recapture method to estimate population numbers of cognitively impaired participants. The latter estimates enabled us to compare the performance characteristics of the two screening batteries at specified cut-offs for detection of dementia and milder forms of impairment. Although our results provide relatively imprecise estimates of the performance characteristics of the two batteries, a comparison of their relative performance suggests that, at selected cut-off points, the TAB produces results broadly comparable to in-person screening and may be slightly more sensitive in detecting mild impairment. TAB performance characteristics also appeared slightly better than those of the TICS alone. Given its benefits in time and cost when screening for cognitive disorders, telephone screening should be considered for large samples.

As such we have focused our attention to the telodiencephalic reproductive complex and the functional interactions with the cortico-limbic circuit that regulate sexual and non-sexual motivation. Major focus of our review was on the animal studies that included hormones, peptides, neurotransmitters and the unique study paradigms that were designed to separate sexual motivation from the consumatory behavior. We also have covered limited number of clinical trials but our primary goal was to review the animal study results. We present rapidly evolving animal research data that we hope will contribute toward the development of new drugs that ameliorate the symptoms of hypoactive sexual desire disorders.

The review concludes that in spite of significant advances there are still many limitations in our understanding of how to describe precipitation patterns in a changing climate in order to design and operate urban drainage infrastructure. Climate change may well be the driver that ensures that changes in urban drainage paradigms are identified and suitable solutions implemented. Design and optimization of urban drainage infrastructure considering climate change impacts and co-optimizing these with other objectives will become ever more important to keep our cities habitable into the future.

Sequence of Synaptogenesis in the Fetal and Neonatal Cerebellar System - Part 1: Guillain-Mollaret Triangle (Dentato-Rubro-Olivo-Cerebellar Circuit)	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Fetus; Synaptogenesis; Synaptophysin; Red nucleus; Inferior olivary nucleus; Dentate nucleus; Accessory olivary and deep cerebellar nuclei	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ALPHA-B-CRYSTALLIN; RED NUCLEUS; SYNAPTOPHYSIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; GENETIC CLASSIFICATION; BRAIN; HYPERTROPHY; NEURONS; MALFORMATIONS; PARVALBUMIN	Precise temporal and spatial sequences of synaptogenesis occur in the cerebellar system, as in other synaptic circuits of the brain. In postmortem brain sections of 172 human fetuses and neonates, synaptophysin immunoreactivity was studied in nuclei of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle: dentato-olivo-rubro-cerebellar circuit. Synaptophysin demonstrates not only progressive increase in synaptic vesicles in each structure, but also shows the development of shape from amorphous globular neuronal aggregates to undulated nuclei. Intensity of synaptophysin reactivity is strong before the mature shape of these nuclei is achieved. Accessory olivary and deep cerebellar nuclei are intensely stained earlier than the principal olivary and dentate nuclei. The dorsal blades of both form earlier than the ventral, with reactivity initially peripheral. Initiation of synaptophysin reactivity is at 13 weeks in the inferior olive (r6, r7) and at 16 weeks in the dentate (r2). Initial synaptic vesicles are noted at 13 weeks in the red nucleus (r0); synapses form initially on the small neurons at 13 weeks but thereafter simultaneously on small and large neurons. Form and reactivity follow caudorostral, dorsoventral and mediolateral gradients in the axes of the rhonnbencephalon. This study provides control data to serve as a basis for interpreting aberrations in synaptogenesis in malformations of the cerebellar system, genetic disorders and acquired insults to the cerebellum and brainstem during fetal life, applicable to tissue sections and complementing biochemical and molecular techniques.

All subsist primarily on wax, are obligatory brood parasites and one species engages in 'guiding' behavior in which it leads human honey hunters to bees' nests. This unique life history has likely shaped the evolution of their brain size and morphology. Here, we test that hypothesis using comparative data on relative brain and brain region size of honeyguides and their relatives: woodpeckers, barbets and toucans. Honeyguides have significantly smaller relative brain volumes than all other piciform taxa. Volumetric measurements of the brain indicate that honeyguides have a significantly larger cerebellum and hippocampal formation (HF) than woodpeckers, the sister clade of the honeyguides, although the HF enlargement was not significant across all of our analyses. Cluster analyses also revealed that the overall composition of the brain and telencephalon differs greatly between honeyguides and woodpeckers. The relatively smaller brains of the honeyguides may be a consequence of brood parasitism and cerophagy ('wax eating'), both of which place energetic constraints on brain development and maintenance. The inconclusive results of our analyses of relative HF volume highlight some of the problems associated with comparative studies of the HF that require further study. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

These stimuli include mechanical stress as applied during the needle manipulation or tuina, high temperatures as applied during moxibustion, and red laser light applied during laser acupuncture. This study aimed to investigate cellular responses to stimuli that might occur in the tissue of acupuncture points. Since they have a characteristically high density of mast cells that degranulate in response to acupuncture, we asked whether these processes lead to ATP release. We tested in in vitro experiments on mast cells of the human mast-cell line HMC-1 the effects of the physical stimuli; mechanical stress was applied by superfusion of the cells with hypotonic solution, heat was applied by incubation of the cells at 52 degrees C, and red laser light of 657 nm was used for irradiation. We demonstrate that all the stimuli induce ATP release from model human mast HMC-1 cells, and this release is associated with an intracellular free Ca2+ rise. We hypothesize that ATP released from mast cells supplements the already known release of ATP from keratinocytes and, by acting on P2X receptors, it may serve as initial mediator of acupuncture-induced analgesia.

We investigated whether alterations in the level of TNF alpha occur at a time point that precedes the reported seizure-associated hyperexcitability of hippocampal networks in pre-plaque models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Western blot and ELISA experiments indicated a significant increase in hippocampal TNF alpha expression in 1-month-old TgCRND8 mice that correlated with levels of the beta-C-terminal fragment (beta CTF) of amyloid-beta protein precursor. CD11b labeling indicated changes in microglial morphology toward an activated state, suggesting that these cells may be a putative source of the observed TNF alpha increase during this pre-symptomatic stage of AD-like pathology.

Jointly, these terms imply that the brain, physical attributes of the self, and features of our interpersonal relationships and of the environments in which we live jointly regulate energy and information flow; they codetermine how we think, feel, and behave both individually and collectively. In addition to direct experience, evidence supports the view that stimuli embedded within past memories trigger multimodal simulations throughout the body and brain to literally recreate lived experience. In this paper, we review empirical support for the concept of an embodied and relational mind and then reflect on the implications of this perspective for clinical interventions in aging individuals and populations. Data suggest that environmental influences literally "get under the skin" with aging; that musculoskeletal and visceral sensations become more prominent in activities of the mind due to aging biological systems and chronic disease. We argue that conceiving the mind as embodied and relational will grow scientific inquiry in aging, transform how we think about the self-system and well-being, and lead us to rethink health promotion interventions aimed at aging individuals and populations.

Cross-orientation masking in human color vision: Application of a two-stage model to assess dichoptic and monocular sources of suppression	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						color vision; cross-orientation masking; contrast gain control; dichoptic; psychophysics; isoluminance	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CONTRAST GAIN-CONTROL; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; DETECTION MECHANISMS; BINOCULAR SUMMATION; CORTICAL-NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; GANGLION-CELLS; INHIBITION	Cross-orientation masking (XOM) occurs when the detection of a test grating is masked by a superimposed grating at an orthogonal orientation, and is thought to reveal the suppressive effects mediating contrast normalization. Medina and Mullen (2009) reported that XOM was greater for chromatic than achromatic stimuli at equivalent spatial and temporal frequencies. Here we address whether the greater suppression found in binocular color vision originates from a monocular or interocular site, or both. We measure monocular and dichoptic masking functions for red-green color contrast and achromatic contrast at three different spatial frequencies (0.375, 0.75, and 1.5 cpd, 2 Hz). We fit these functions with a modified two-stage masking model (Meese & Baker, 2009) to extract the monocular and interocular weights of suppression. We find that the weight of monocular suppression is significantly higher for color than achromatic contrast, whereas dichoptic suppression is similar for both. These effects are invariant across spatial frequency. We then apply the model to the binocular masking data using the measured values of the monocular and interocular sources of suppression and show that these are sufficient to account for color binocular masking. We conclude that the greater strength of chromatic XOM has a monocular origin that transfers through to the binocular site.

This model predicts enhanced low-level (discrimination of psychophysical dimensions), and mid- and high-level (pattern detection and identification) perception. The EPF model is here tested for olfaction by investigating olfactory function in autistic and Asperger participants. Experiment I targeted higher-order olfactory processing by assessing olfactory identification in nine Asperger, ten autistic, and eleven typically developed individuals. Experiment 2 focused on low-level olfactory processing; we assessed odour detection thresholds and odour discrimination in five Asperger, five autistic, and five typically developed males. Olfactory identification was impaired in autistic participants relative to control and Asperger participants. Typical performance in low-level olfactory processing suggests that neural mechanisms involved in the perceptual phenotype of AS do not affect structures implicated in olfactory processing. Reduced olfactory identification is limited to autistic participants who displayed speech delay and may be due to a reduced facility to use verbal labels. The apparent absence of enhanced olfactory perception of AS participants distinguishes the olfactory system from the other sensory modalities and might be caused by the absence of an obligatory thalamic relay.

Patterns of Brain Atrophy in Clinical Variants of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration	DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Frontotemporal dementia; Primary progressive aphasia; Longitudinal study; Magnetic resonance imaging; Tensor-based morphometry; White matter	TENSOR-BASED MORPHOMETRY; PRIMARY-PROGRESSIVE-APHASIA; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; WHITE-MATTER CHANGES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; SEMANTIC DEMENTIA; DIFFUSION; MRI; PATHOLOGY	Background/Aims: The clinical syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration include behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and semantic (SV-PPA) and nonfluent variants (NF-PPA) of primary progressive aphasia. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tensor-based morphometry (TBM) was used to determine distinct patterns of atrophy between these three clinical groups. Methods: Twenty-seven participants diagnosed with bvFTD, 16 with SV-PPA, and 19 with NF-PPA received baseline and follow-up MRI scans approximately 1 year apart. TBM was used to create three-dimensional Jacobian maps of local brain atrophy rates for individual subjects. Results: Regional analyses were performed on the three-dimensional maps and direct comparisons between groups (corrected for multiple comparisons using permutation tests) revealed significantly greater frontal lobe and frontal white matter atrophy in the bvFTD relative to the SV-PPA group (p < 0.005). The SV-PPA subjects exhibited significantly greater atrophy than the bvFTD in the fusiform gyrus (p = 0.007). The NF-PPA group showed significantly more atrophy in the parietal lobes relative to both bvFTD and SV-PPA groups (p < 0.05). Percent volume change in ventromedial prefrontal cortex was significantly associated with baseline behavioral symptomatology. Conclusion: The bvFTD, SV-PPA, and NF-PPA groups displayed distinct patterns of progressive atrophy over a 1-year period that correspond well to the behavioral disturbances characteristic of the clinical syndromes. More specifically, the bvFTD group showed significant white matter contraction and presence of behavioral symptoms at baseline predicted significant volume loss of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

The goal of this review is to systematically survey all adjuvant treatments after surgery investigated in rat and mouse models. Both PubMed and Embase were explored with a systematic bibliographic search algorithm. Inclusion criteria consisted of treatments applied to rats or mice after complete transection and microsurgical repair of lower-limb motor or mixed nerves. Effect size statistics enabled numerical comparison between outcomes of treated and untreated animals and ranked the best treatments. 1,553 articles were found according to our search strategies, and 22 of them corresponded to our pre-defined inclusion criteria. After data extraction and analysis, the top 3 adjuvant strategies in terms of combined average effect size were citicoline, neurotrophin-4, and nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor, with values of 5.52, 5.14 and 4.08, respectively. Definitive treatment comparison was difficult due to the lack of uniformity in outcome evaluation in the experiments performed. Animal studies, comparing treatments administered within the same experimental protocol, are needed to truly assess efficiency and to provide solid recommendations for future clinical investigation.

J	L'Heureux-Lebeau, B; Saliba, I				L'Heureux-Lebeau, Benedicte; Saliba, Issam			Updates on the diagnosis and treatment of intracranial nerve malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors	ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY			English	Review						malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor; MPNST; neurofibroma; malignant schwannoma	GAMMA-KNIFE RADIOSURGERY; OF-THE-LITERATURE; ANTERIOR SKULL BASE; VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA; TRIGEMINAL NERVE; STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; ACOUSTIC NERVE; TRITON TUMOR; FRACTIONATED RADIOTHERAPY; TRANSFORMATION	Background: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare entities and MPNSTs of intracranial nerves are even more sporadic. MPNSTs present diagnosis and treatment challenges since there are no defined diagnosis criteria and no established therapeutic strategies. Methods: We reviewed literature for MPNST-related articles. We found 45 relevant studies in which 60 cases were described. Results: We identified 60 cases of intracranial nerve MPNSTs. The age ranged from 3 to 75 years old. Male to female ratio was 1.5:1. The most involved cranial nerves (CNs) were CN VIII (60%), CN V (27%), and CN VII (10%). Most of the MPNSTs reported (47%) arose sporadically, 40% arose from a schwannoma, 8% arose from a neurofibroma, and 6% arose from an unspecified nerve tumor. Twenty patients had a history of radiation exposure, four patients had neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), four patients had neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), and NF2 was suspected in two other patients. Twenty-two patients were treated with radiotherapy and presented a higher survival rate. Seventy-two percent of patients died of their disease while 28% of patients survived. One-year survival rate was 33%. Forty-five percent of tumors recurred and 19% of patients had metastases. Conclusion: MPNSTs involving CNs are very rare. Diagnosis is made in regards to the histological and pathological findings. Imaging may help orient the diagnosis. A preexisting knowledge of the clinical situation is more likely to lead to a correct diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is radical surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy. Since these tumors are associated with a poor prognosis, a close follow-up is mandatory.

Adolescents were evaluated using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS). A neurologist classified CP subtype. Most adolescents were ambulatory with or without utilization of aids (GMFCS level I: 35.0%, II: 30.0%, III: 5.8%, IV: 10.8%, and V: 18.3%). MACS levels were I: 34.2%, II: 25.8%, III: 16.7%, IV: 7.5%, and V: 15.8%. Correlations between GMFCS and MACS were strong in youth with quadriplegia (r = .89, p < .001), moderate in individuals with diplegia (r = .58, p = .01), but weakly associated for adolescents with hemiplegia (r = .24, p = .23). The findings provide evidence for maintaining a clinical distinction between spastic quadriplegia and spastic diplegia. Manual ability may not be congruent with mobility in adolescents with CP and should be specifically evaluated given its importance to daily life functioning.

Objective: To determine the effect of latrepirdine on cognition and global function in patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease. Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Setting: Sixty-four research centers in Australia, Europe, and North America. Patients: Four hundred three patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and baseline cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 10-26). Intervention: Latrepirdine (20 mg) vs matching placebo administered orally 3 times daily for 26 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: The co-primary outcome measures were cognition as measured by the change in Mini-Mental State Examination score from baseline to week 26 and global function at week 26 as measured by the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview, which ranges from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included behavior, daily function, motor function, and safety. Results: The mean change in Mini-Mental State Examination score among participants randomized to latrepirdine (1.5-point improvement) did not differ significantly from that among participants randomized to placebo (1.3-point improvement) (P=.39). Similarly, the distribution of the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change, plus carer interview did not differ significantly among those randomized to latrepirdine compared with placebo (P=.84). No significant treatment effects were detected on the secondary efficacy outcome measures. The incidence of adverse events was similar between those randomized to latrepirdine (68.5%) and placebo (68.0%). Conclusion: In patients with mild to moderate Huntington disease and cognitive impairment, treatment with latrepirdine for 6 months was safe and well tolerated but did not improve cognition or global function relative to placebo.

Preference for fatty foods, regulated in part by the brain reward system, may contribute to the development of obesity. Objective: To examine whether prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking is associated with enhanced fat intake and risk for obesity, and whether these associations may be related to subtle structural variations in brain regions involved in reward processing. Design: Cross-sectional study of a population-based cohort. Setting: The Saguenay Youth Study, Quebec, Canada. Participants: A total of 378 adolescents (aged 13 to 19 years; Tanner stage 4 and 5 of sexual maturation), half of whom were exposed prenatally to maternal cigarette smoking (mean [SD], 11.1 [6.8] cigarettes/d). Main Outcome Measures: Fat intake was assessed with a 24-hour food recall (percentage of energy intake con-sumed as fat). Body adiposity was measured with anthropometry and multifrequency bioimpedance. Volumes of key brain structures involved in reward processing, namely the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and orbitofrontal cortex, were measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Exposed vs nonexposed subjects exhibited a higher total body fat (by approximately 1.7 kg; P =. 009) and fat intake (by 2.7%; P =. 001). They also exhibited a lower volume of the amygdala (by 95mm(3); P <.001) but not of the other 2 brain structures. Consistent with its possible role in limiting fat intake, amygdala volume correlated inversely with fat intake (r=-0.15; P=. 006). Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking may promote obesity by enhancing dietary preference for fat, and this effect may be mediated in part through subtle structural variations in the amygdala.

The nature of these mechanisms remains unclear, however. Based on an extensive review of published evidence, we argue that three interesting leads are emerging. First, N may reflect individual differences in brain circuits involved in perception of and cognitive control over negative stimuli. More specifically, reduced connectivity between the left amygdala and ACC may impair extinction of the amygdala response to anxiety-eliciting stimuli. Second, the neural evidence matches the psychological findings, which associate N with a negative bias in attention, interpretation and recall of information, increased reactivity, and ineffective coping, and is consistent with findings of decreased cardiovascular flexibility. Third, current studies suggest that HPA-axis influences mood independently of N. Strong claims on N's biological basis, however, are not yet justified due to inconsistencies and lack of replication which are in part due to methodological limitations and N's heterogeneity. We discuss potential methodological improvements and substantive directions for future research. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to a lack of naturally-occurring animal model for investigating AD pathogenesis, our knowledge about the disease must be derived from correlational observation of humans, or from animal models produced by genetic manipulation of known risk factors in humans. Advances in neuroimaging, cellular and molecular science, and computational methods have proven useful for the improvement of such techniques, but the general limitation persists; as a result we remain without clear answers to some of the fundamental questions posed by AD. On the other hand, much progress has been made in characterizing the longitudinal progression of AD pathology, which includes the formation of "plaques and tangles", a distinct topological pattern of atrophy of grey and white matter, and the concurrent decline of specific cognitive functions, beginning with mild memory impairments and ending with general debilitating dementia. In this review, we first discuss the existing literature which characterizes AD etiology, pathology, and pathogenesis, with the intention of framing the disease as primarily a "disconnection syndrome". We next describe methodologies for investigating the topological properties of human brain networks, using graph theoretical techniques and connectivity information derived from anatomical and diffusion-weighted MR imaging. Finally, we discuss how these methodologies have been applied to systems-level analyses of AD, to help characterize the network changes underlying the disease process, and how these patterns relate to specific cognitive outcome measures.

Methods: Thirty unilaterally lesioned young adults were tested a decade after lesion onset with an effort-demanding complex executive function (EF) task as well as a task of incidental declarative retrospective episodic recognition memory (IRM). Thirty neurotypical participants were also tested. Results: The EF task was significantly impaired in the lesion group and significantly more so than the IRM task. Regarding the lesioned cases, performance on EF, but not IRM, was significantly positively correlated with long-term educational persistence (EP). Both EF and EP but not IRM were significantly positively correlated with the age of onset of the lesion. Severity of neurological impairment was unrelated to any variable. Conclusion: Mental abilities acquired through early schooling remain impaired into adulthood when early schooling is disturbed, not everyday memory which does not depend on schooling.

HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article							PREPULSE INHIBITION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; SLEEP COMPLAINTS; TEMPORAL ACUITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; HEARING-LOSS; BASE-LINE; REFLEX; NOISE; RATS	The measurement of tinnitus in humans relies on subjective measures such as self-report, visual analog scales and questionnaires. Gap detection impairments have been tested in animals in an attempt to objectify the presence of tinnitus. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the gap startle paradigm in human participants with high-frequency tinnitus. Fifteen adults with bilateral high-frequency tinnitus but normal hearing at standard frequencies and seventeen matched controls without tinnitus were tested. The psychoacoustic characteristics of the tinnitus spectrum (pitch and loudness) were assessed using novel participant-directed custom-made methods. The startle task consisted of startle-alone, prepulse inhibition and gap-in-noise condition at low- and high-background noise frequencies. All measurements were retested after several months. Data indicate normal prepulse inhibition but higher reactivity to the startle sounds in the tinnitus group in comparison with controls. Most importantly, the tinnitus group displayed a consistent deficit in gap processing at both low- and high-background noise frequencies. All effects were identified consistently and were reproducible at retest. We propose that the higher reactivity to startle might reflect hyperacusis and that the gap deficit might be an index of abnormal cortical auditory processing in tinnitus. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Antinociceptive effects of two deltorphins analogs in the tail-immersion test in rats	PEPTIDES			English	Article						Deltorphins analogs; Morphine; Nociception; Tail-immersion test; Tolerance; Rats	DELTA-OPIOID RECEPTORS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; ENKEPHALIN ANALOGS; HIGH-AFFINITY; BONE PAIN; MORPHINE; MU; AGONIST; ANALGESIA; TOLERANCE	The antinociceptive effects of analogs of deltorphins: cyclo(N delta,N delta-carbonyl-D-Orn2, Orn4)deltorphin (DEL-6) and deltorphin II N-(ureidoethyl)amide (DK-4) after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration were investigated in the tail-immersion test in rats. Morphine, the most commonly used mu-opioid receptors (MOR) agonist, was employed as a reference compound. The contribution of the MOR, delta-(DOR) and kappa-opioid receptors (KOR) in antinociceptive effects of the deltorphins analogs was studies using selective antagonists of these receptors. The results indicated that DK-4 (5, 10 and 20 nmol) and DEL-6 (5, 10 and 20 nmol) were the most effective in alleviating thermal pain at the dose of 20 nmol. The antinociceptive potency of DEL-6 at the dose of 20 nmol was approximately equal but DK-4 at the dose of 20 nmol was less effective than morphine at the dose of 13 nmol. DOR antagonist - naltrindole (NTI, 5 nmol) very strongly and, to the lower extent MOR antagonist - beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA, 5 nmol), inhibited antinociceptive effect of DK-4 (20 nmol). In turn, beta-FNA was more potent than NTI in inhibition of the antinociceptive effects of DEL-6. Co-administration of DEL-6 and morphine at doses of 5 nmol, which do not produce measurable antinociception, generated additive antinociceptive effect. Chronic intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of morphine (9 days) displayed a marked analgesic tolerance to the challenge dose of morphine and a slight cross-tolerance to challenge doses of DEL-6 and DK-4, given i.c.v. These findings indicate that the new deltorphin analogs recruit DOR and MOR to attenuate the nociceptive response to acute thermal stimuli. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Kotlinska, J.

Twenty-nine ALS patients with spinal onset and twenty-one healthy controls were recruited. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetization transfer and atrophy index were measured in the spinal cord, complemented with transcranial magnetic stimulations. Metrics were quantified within the lateral corticospinal and the dorsal segments of the cervical cord. Significant differences were detected between patients and controls for DTI and magnetization transfer metrics in the lateral and dorsal segments of the spinal cord. Fractional anisotropy correlated with ALSFRS-R (p = 0.04) and motor threshold (p = 0.02). Stepwise linear regression detected local spinal cord atrophy associated with weakness in the corresponding muscle territory, i.e. C4 level for deltoid and C7 level for hand muscles. In conclusion, impairment of spinal sensory pathways was detected at an early stage of the disease. Our data also demonstrate an association between muscle deficits and local spinal cord atrophy, suggesting that atrophy is a sensitive biomarker for lower motor neurons degeneration.

In this critical review of the literature, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and sexuality are examined. A general review of the concept of sexuality and the neurological correlates of sexual function are proposed as a framework to understand the cognitive, behavioral and physical effects of TBI on sexuality and sexual function. Studies are then classified according to the participants enrolled and findings are presented from the professional's, the survivor's, the patient/partner's, and the non-injured spouse's perspectives. Results are discussed taking into account methodological limitations and knowledge gaps. Next, implications for sexual rehabilitation for individuals with TBI are discussed. Finally, suggestions for future research and their pertinence for improving rehabilitation outcomes are considered.

In the setting of radiation and/or chronic infection and when skeletal reconstruction of the cranium is not recommended, standard calvarial reconstruction needs to be refined. The standard use of the latissimus dorsi only was associated with potential dead space over the dura, limited skin paddle size, and potential external contour irregularities. Methods: In this study, we present our approach to complex calvarial reconstruction with free tissue transfer without bone grafting while avoiding contour deformities in 1 efficient surgical procedure. We propose the "tournedos" turnover de-epithelialized latissimus dorsi flap, which provides stable dermal and subdermal tissue that will not undergo atrophy over time over the dura. To reach an adequate aesthetic result, we used a uniform, unmeshed, thick split-thickness skin graft over the muscular portion of the tournedos flap. Patients who underwent this procedure, from March 1992 to March 2012, at McGill University Health Center and the Montreal Neurological Institute were included. Results: Thirty-three complex microsurgical procedures for oncologic calvarial defect reconstructions were performed from March 1992 to March 2012. Among them, 6 patients benefited from the tournedos procedure. The average age was 74 years. Scalp defects sizes ranged from 4 x 10 to 16 x 18 cm (40Y288 cm(2)). All latissimus dorsi flap donor sites were closed primarily. Patients kept their donor-site drains for approximately 18 days (+/- 5 days). One patient developed a seroma at the donor site after drain removal that was treated conservatively. All patients were satisfied with their reconstructions, and no secondary procedures were necessary. We present our most recent case with good photographic documentation. Conclusions: Our approach using the tournedos turnover deepithelialized free flap provides durable and stable coverage for irradiated and/or previously infected calvarial defects. It is a safe procedure in those challenging complex cases and offers many advantages.

Recent data from human and animal literature suggest that epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, are involved not only in cellular differentiation but also in the modulation of genome function in response to early life experience affecting gene function and the phenotype. Such modulations may serve as a mechanism for life-long genome adaptation. These changes seem to be widely distributed across the genome and to involve central and peripheral systems. Examining the environmental circumstances associated with the onset and reversal of DNA methylation will be critical for understanding risk and resiliency.

Extensive bilateral arteriovenous malformations of the mandible successfully controlled by combined endovascular and transcutaneous angio-embolization: Case report and review of the literature	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Review						Arteriovenous malformations; Mandible; Transcutaneous; Angio-embolization; Endovascular	VASCULAR MALFORMATIONS; MANAGEMENT; REGION	We report a unique case of extensive bilateral arteriovenous malformation (AVMs) in a child's mandible, discuss treatment options and review literature. A healthy 8 year-old girl presented with bright blood of unknown source found on her pillow. Three large AVMs involving the symphyseal region and bilateral mandibular bodies were found on angiography. Due to the extent of surgical resection required, the patient underwent a series of endovascular and transcutaneous angio-embolization. In cases of extensive intraosseous AVMs, serial embolization procedures can be successful in controlling episodes of hemorrhage and allow for bone remineralization. A multidisciplinary approach by otolaryngologists and neurointerventional radiologists can optimize the results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Blobs versus bars: Psychophysical evidence supports two types of orientation response in human color vision	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						vision; cortex; orientation; color vision; contrast; psychophysics; isoluminance	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; RED-GREEN CHANNEL; BINOCULAR SUMMATION; PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION; DETECTION MECHANISMS; SUBTHRESHOLD SUMMATION; CHROMATIC MECHANISMS; LUMINANCE MECHANISMS; SIMULTANEOUS MASKING	The classic hypothesis of Livingstone and Hubel (1984, 1987) proposed two types of color pathways in primate visual cortex based on recordings from single cells: a segregated, modular pathway that signals color but provides little information about shape or form and a second pathway that signals color differences and so defines forms without the need to specify their colors. A major problem has been to reconcile this neurophysiological hypothesis with the behavioral data. A wealth of psychophysical studies has demonstrated that color vision has orientation-tuned responses and little impairment on form related tasks, but these have not revealed any direct evidence for nonoriented mechanisms. Here we use a psychophysical method of subthreshold summation across orthogonal orientations for isoluminant red-green gratings in monocular and dichoptic viewing conditions to differentiate between nonoriented and orientation-tuned responses to color contrast. We reveal nonoriented color responses at low spatial frequencies (0.25-0.375 c/deg) under monocular conditions changing to orientation-tuned responses at higher spatial frequencies (1.5 c/deg) and under binocular conditions. We suggest that two distinct pathways coexist in color vision at the behavioral level, revealed at different spatial scales: one is isotropic, monocular, and best equipped for the representation of surface color, and the other is orientation-tuned, binocular, and selective for shape and form. This advances our understanding of the organization of the neural pathways involved in human color vision and provides a strong link between neurophysiological and behavioral data.

Left hemifield presentations (initially processed by the RH) lead to a globally higher error rate, slower word identification, and a significantly stronger word length effect (i.e., slower reaction times for longer words). Because the visuo-perceptual mechanisms of the brain for word recognition are primarily localized in the LH (Cohen et al., 2003), it is possible that this part of the brain possesses better spatial frequency (SF) tuning for processing the visual properties of words than the RH. The main objective of this study is to determine the SF tuning functions of the LH and RH for word recognition. Each word image was randomly sampled in the SF domain using the SF bubbles method (Willenbockel et al., 2010) and was presented laterally to the left or right visual hemifield. As expected, the LH requires less visual information than the RH to reach the same level of performance, illustrating the well-known LH advantage for word recognition. Globally, the SF tuning of both hemispheres is similar. However, these seemingly identical tuning functions hide important differences. Most importantly, we argue that the RH requires higher SFs to identify longer words because of crowding.

Failure to detect associations between postnatal exposure and health outcomes may stem from the limitations of commonly employed approaches to assess lactational exposure. The aim of the present study was to assess whether lactational exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl-153 (PCB-153), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), or hexachlorobenzene (HCB) as estimated with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, is associated with decrements in mental and psychomotor development scores of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) test in children aged around 14-months of a subsample (N = 1175) of the Spanish INMA birth cohort, and to compare this with the effects of prenatal exposure. Although in the present study population PCB-153, DDE and HCB exposure increased within the first months of postnatal life, no associations were found between different periods of postnatal exposure to these compounds and mental or psychomotor scores. Increasing prenatal PCB-153 concentrations were associated with worse mental and psychomotor scores, although significance was only reached for psychomotor development (beta [95%CI] = -1.36 [-2.61, -0.11]). Indeed, the association between exposure and effects observed during prenatal life weakened gradually across periods of postnatal life. Results of the present study suggest that, although breastfeeding increases children's blood persistent organic pollutants (POPs) levels during postnatal life, deleterious effects of PCB-153 on neuropsychological development are mainly attributable to prenatal exposure.

Methods: Observational study of patients referred for the diagnostic evaluation of syncope. Patients were divided into four groups according to their BMI: <18.5 kg/m(2), 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2), 25-29.9 kg/m(2), and >30 kg/m(2). Results: A total of 419 patients were evaluated. The mean age was 43 +/- 22 years, and 62% were female. The prevalence of a positive tilt test was different between groups when stratified by BMI (P = 0.01), with a higher proportion of patients with positive tests among those with BMI <18.5 kg/m(2) compared with other groups (P = 0.05). Multivariate analysis also showed that underweight patients had a 3.9 times higher risk for a positive HUT response (P = 0.01); additionally, the use of contraceptive drugs was associated with a protective effect during HUT (odds ratio: 0.35, confidence interval: 0.19-0.45, P = 0.001). Conclusion: In our sample, changes in BMI are associated with a positive response for HUT, and oral contraceptives seemed to protect against this response. Further studies are needed with larger numbers of patients to corroborate this finding.

It is due to autosomal recessive mutations confined to exon "HSN2" of the WNK1 (with-no-lysine protein kinase 1) serine-threonine kinase. While this kinase is well studied in the kidneys, little is known about its role in the nervous system. We hypothesized that the truncating mutations present in the neural-specific HSN2 exon lead to a loss-of-function of the WNK1 kinase, impairing development of the peripheral sensory system. To investigate the mechanisms by which the loss of WNK1/HSN2 isoform function causes HSANII, we used the embryonic zebrafish model and observed strong expression of WNK1/HSN2 in neuromasts of the peripheral lateral line (PLL) system by immunohistochemistry. Knocking down wnk1/hsn2 in embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides led to improper PLL development. We then investigated the reported interaction between the WNK1 kinase and neuronal potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2, as this transporter is a target of WNK1 phosphorylation. In situ hybridization revealed kcc2 expression in mature neuromasts of the PLL and semi-quantitative RT-PCR of wnk1/hsn2 knockdown embryos showed an increased expression of kcc2 mRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of human KCC2 mRNA in embryos replicated the wnk1/hsn2 knockdown phenotype. We validated these results by obtaining double knockdown embryos, both for wnk1/hsn2 and kcc2, which alleviated the PLL defects. Interestingly, overexpression of inactive mutant KCC2-C568A, which does not extrude ions, allowed a phenocopy of the PLL defects. These results suggest a pathway in which WNK1/HSN2 interacts with KCC2, producing a novel regulation of its transcription independent of KCC2's activation, where a loss-of-function mutation in WNK1 induces an overexpression of KCC2 and hinders proper peripheral sensory nerve development, a hallmark of HSANII.

Recent genome-wide analyses have considerably extended the list of human genes encoding putative methyltransferases. Studies on protein methyltransferases have revealed that the regulatory function of methylation is not limited to epigenetics, with many non-histone substrates now being discovered. We present here our findings on a novel family of distantly related putative methyltransferases. Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry shows a marked preference for these proteins to associate with various chaperones. Based on the spectral data, we were able to identify methylation sites in substrates, notably trimethylation of K135 of KIN/Kin17, K561 of HSPA8/Hsc70 as well as corresponding lysine residues in other Hsp70 isoforms, and K315 of VCP/p97. All modification sites were subsequently confirmed in vitro. In the case of VCP, methylation by METTL21D was stimulated by the addition of the UBX cofactor ASPSCR1, which we show directly interacts with the methyltransferase. This stimulatory effect was lost when we used VCP mutants (R155H, R159G, and R191Q) known to cause Inclusion Body Myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and Fronto-temporal Dementia (IBMPFD) and/or familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Lysine 315 falls in proximity to the Walker B motif of VCP's first ATPase/D1 domain. Our results indicate that methylation of this site negatively impacts its ATPase activity. Overall, this report uncovers a new role for protein methylation as a regulatory pathway for molecular chaperones and defines a novel regulatory mechanism for the chaperone VCP, whose deregulation is causative of degenerative neuromuscular diseases.

We analyzed postnatal growth and cortical development in three different mutant mouse strains with constitutive reductions in central 5-HT levels. We compared two previously published mouse strains with severe (-95%) depletions of 5-HT, the tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph) 2(-/-) mouse line and VMAT2(sert-cre) mice, with a new strain, in which VMAT2 deletion is driven by Pet1 (VMAT2(pet1-cre)) in 5-HT raphe neurons leading to partial (-75%) reduction in brain 5-HT levels. We find that normal embryonic growth and postnatal growth retardation are common features of all these mouse strains. Postnatal growth retardation varied from mild to severe according to the extent of the brain 5-HT reduction and gender. Normal growth was reinstated in VMAT2(sert-cre) mice by reconstituting central 5-HT stores. Growth abnormalities could not be linked to altered food intake or temperature control. Morphological study of the cerebral cortex over postnatal development showed a delayed maturation of the upper cortical layers in the VMAT2(sert-cre) and Tph2(-/-) mice, but not in the VMAT2(pet1-cre) mice. No changes in layer-specific gene expression or morphological alterations of barrel cortex development were found. Overall, these observations sustain the notion that central 5-HT signaling is required for the preweaning growth spurt of mouse pups. Brain development appeared to be immune to severe central 5-HT depletion for its overall growth during prenatal life, whereas reduced brain growth and delayed cortical maturation development occurred during postnatal life. Reduced developmental 5-HT signaling during postnatal development might modulate the function and fine structure of neural circuits in ways that affect adult behavior.

Recent studies have shown that functional connectivity analysis can detect compensatory activity, not revealed by standard analysis. Little is known, however, about the default-mode network in aphasia. In the current study, we studied changes in the default-mode network in subjects with aphasia who underwent semantic feature analysis therapy. We studied nine participants with chronic aphasia and compared them to 10 control participants. For the first time, we identified the default-mode network using spatial independent component analysis, in participants with aphasia. Intensive therapy improved integration in the posterior areas of the default-mode network concurrent with language improvement. Correlations between integration and improvement did not reach significance, but the trend suggests that pre-therapy integration of the default-mode network may predict therapy outcomes. Functional connectivity allows a better understanding of the impact of semantic feature analysis in aphasia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Measures of network integration that characterize the global integrative state of a network (Marrelec, Bellec et al., 2008) were gathered, in the shallow and consolidation phases of L2 vocabulary learning. Functional connectivity remained unchanged across learning phases for L1, whereas total, between- and within-network integration levels decreased as proficiency for L2 increased. The results of this study provide the first functional connectivity evidence regarding the dynamic role of the language processing and cognitive control networks in L2 learning (Abutalebi, Cappa, & Perani, 2005; Altarriba & Heredia, 2008; Leonard et al., 2011; Parker-Jones et al., 2011). Thus, increased proficiency results in a higher degree of automaticity and lower cognitive effort (Segalowitz & Hulstijn, 2005). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Enhanced left frontal involvement during novel metaphor comprehension in schizophrenia: Evidence from functional neuroimaging	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Novel metaphors; Lateralization; Language; fMRI	RIGHT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE; WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE; EXPRESSIONS; MEANINGS; MIND; LATERALIZATION; COMMUNICATION; COMPETENCE; ACTIVATION	The neural basis involved in novel metaphor comprehension in schizophrenia is relatively unknown. Fourteen people with schizophrenia and fourteen controls were scanned while they silently read novel metaphors, conventional metaphors, literal expressions, and meaningless word-pairs. People with schizophrenia showed reduced comprehension of both novel and conventional metaphors. Furthermore, while controls showed enhanced brain activation in right inferior, frontal gyrus (IFG) for novel metaphors versus meaningless word-pairs, people with schizophrenia showed an over-activation of left IFG and middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Direct comparison between the groups revealed greater activation in left precuneus for both novel metaphors and literal expressions vs. baseline for individuals with schizophrenia. Direct comparison for novel metaphors vs. literal expressions also revealed increased activation for individuals with schizophrenia in left MFG. These results suggest that the inefficient processing of novel metaphors in schizophrenia involves compensatory recruitment of additional brain regions that include the left MFG and left precuneus.

While it is clear that PT contributes to auditory language processing there is still some uncertainty about its role in spoken language production. Methods: Here we examine activation patterns of the PT for speech production, speech perception and single word reading to address potential hemispheric and regional functional specialization in the human PT. To this aim, we manually segmented the left and right PT in three non-overlapping regions (medial, lateral and caudal PT) and examined, in two complementary experiments, the contribution of exogenous and endogenous auditory input on PT activation under different speech processing and production conditions. Results: Our results demonstrate that different speech tasks are associated with different regional functional activation patterns of the medial, lateral and caudal PT. These patterns are similar across hemispheres, suggesting bilateral processing of the auditory signal for speech at the level of PT. Conclusions: Results of the present studies stress the importance of considering the anatomical complexity of the PT in interpreting fMRI data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Students' uncertainty is of primary interest as it is deeply rooted in the process of knowledge construction. In this paper we propose a new sensor-based multimodal approach to model users' uncertainty from their affective reactions and cognitive and personal characteristics. An experimental protocol was conducted to record participants' brain activity and physiological signals while they interacted with a computer-based problem solving system and self-reported their perceived level of uncertainty during the tasks. We study key indicators from affective reactions, trait-questionnaire responses, and individual differences that are related to uncertainty states. Then we develop models to automatically predict levels of uncertainty using machine learning techniques. Evidence indicated that students' uncertainty is associated to their mental and emotional reactions. Personal characteristics such as gender, skill level, and personality traits also showed a priori tendencies to be more or less in particular uncertainty states. The SVM algorithm demonstrated the best accuracy results for classifying students' uncertainty levels. Our findings have implications for ITS seeking to continuously monitor users' internal states so they can ultimately provide efficient interventions to enhance learning.

Although the response-locked motor potential may link the ERP components to the recorded response, to our knowledge no previous attempt has been made to predict a priori (i.e. before any contact with the electroencephalographic data) the time occurrence of an ERP component based only on the modeling of an overt response. The proposed analysis relies on the delta-lognormal modeling of velocity, as proposed by the kinematic theory of rapid human movement used in several studies of motor control. Although some methodological aspects of this technique still need to be fine-tuned, the initial results showed that the model-based kinematic analysis allowed the prediction of the time occurrence of a motor command ERP in most participants in the experiment. The average map of the motor command ERPs showed that this signal was stronger in electrodes close to the contra-lateral motor area (Fz, FCz, FC1, and FC3). These results seem to support the claims made by the kinematic theory that a motor command is emitted at time t0, the time reference parameter of the model. This article proposes a new time marker directly associated with a cerebral event (i.e. the emission of a motor command) that can be used for the development of new data analysis methodologies and for the elaboration of new experimental protocols based on ERP.

Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) is a water-soluble derivative of TSIIA and it is currently used for treating cardiovascular diseases in China. Areas covered: The article presents a review of the anti-atherosclerosis, cardioprotective effects, neuroprotection and anti-tumor activities of TSIIA and a review of patents on tanshinone derivatives from January 2006 to September 2012. Expert opinion: Mechanistic studies have discovered that TSIIA modulates ion channels, kinases, hormone receptors, apoptosis proteins, growth factors, cytokines, microRNA, tumor suppressor and many other targets, revealing an intricate biological network modulated by TSIIA. Many patents have attempted to overcome the low water solubility of TSIIA and tanshinone I by attaching a polar substituent or by a prodrug strategy. However, biological activities of these tanshinone derivatives need to be further evaluated. Given the extensive in vitro and in vivo biological activities of TSIIA, this compound is a promising candidate to be further developed as a novel therapeutics for treating atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

Accordingly, intracolonic capsaicin, which generates robust secondary (referred) allodynia on the abdomen of mice, also causes an increased spinal c-Fos labeling. In naive rodents, low intensity innocuous stimulation does not affect c-Fos labeling in spinal nociceptive regions. However, after persistent noxious input, low intensity stimulation of the inflamed region further enhances c-Fos labeling, suggesting that low threshold mechanosensitive fibers gain access to the nociceptive channel after persistent inflammation. We have previously proposed that afferent activity in low threshold sensory fibers activates nociceptive sensory fibers through Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter 1 (NKCC1)-mediated enhanced primary afferent depolarization. Here, we show that intracolonic capsaicin enhances spinal c-Fos labeling and secondary allodynia in an NKCC1-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gently brushing the abdomen, the region of secondary allodynia, further increased spinal c-Fos levels, an effect that can be prevented by spinal NKCC1 blockade. These findings provide evidence that increased NKCC1 activity contributes to secondary allodynia and that innocuous touch can access the nociceptive channel in part through enhanced NKCC1 activity. Perspective: While touch normally soothes acute pain, we demonstrate that following peripheral inflammation, touch evokes pain (allodynia) through the switching of a normally inhibitory spinal pathway into an excitatory pathway. Activation of low threshold mechanoreceptors activates spinal nociceptive neurons following inflammation-induced enhancement of NKCC1 expression, as measured by spinal c-Fos labeling.

Topical Combinations Aimed at Treating Microvascular Dysfunction Reduce Allodynia in Rat Models of CRPS-I and Neuropathic Pain	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						Nociception; allodynia; analgesia; synergy; endothelial cell dysfunction	REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY; CHRONIC POSTISCHEMIA PAIN; INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; SECONDARY RAYNAUDS-PHENOMENON; ACID GENERATION INHIBITOR; STABLE ANGINA-PECTORIS; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; PHOSPHATIDIC-ACID; ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; PLATELET-AGGREGATION	Growing evidence indicates that various chronic pain syndromes exhibit tissue abnormalities caused by microvasculature dysfunction in the blood vessels of skin, muscle, or nerve. We tested whether topical combinations aimed at improving microvascular function would relieve allodynia in animal models of complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I) and neuropathic pain. We hypothesized that topical administration of either alpha(2)-adrenergic (alpha(2)A) receptor agonists or nitric oxide (NO) donors combined with either phosphodiesterase (PDE) or phosphatidic acid (PA) inhibitors would effectively reduce allodynia in these animal models of chronic pain. Single topical agents produced significant dose-dependent antiallodynic effects in rats with chronic postischemia pain, and the antiallodynic dose-response curves of PDE and PA inhibitors were shifted 2.5- to 10-fold leftward when combined with nonanalgesic doses of alpha(2)A receptor agonists or NO donors. Topical combinations also produced significant antiallodynic effects in rats with sciatic nerve injury, painful diabetic neuropathy, and chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy. These effects were shown to be produced by a local action, lasted up to 6 hours after acute treatment, and did not produce tolerance over 15 days of chronic daily dosing. The present results support the hypothesis that allodynia in animal models of CRPS-I and neuropathic pain is effectively relieved by topical combinations of alpha(2)A or NO donors with PDE or PA inhibitors. This suggests that topical treatments aimed at improving microvascular function may reduce allodynia in patients with CRPS-I and neuropathic pain. Perspective: This article presents the synergistic antiallodynic effects of combinations of alpha(2)A or NO donors with PDE or PA inhibitors in animal models of CRPS-1 and neuropathic pain. The data suggest that effective clinical treatment of chronic neuropathic pain may be achieved by therapies that alleviate microvascular dysfunction in affected areas.

If the alternate, rhythmic movements of the forelimbs which allow this locomotion are generated by the developing spinal motor networks, sensory information is nonetheless needed to guide the newborn to a nipple. Behavioral, anatomical and physiological studies suggest that the auditory and the visual systems are insufficiently developed in newborn opossums to influence spinal motor centers, while the vestibular, trigeminal, and olfactory systems are likelier candidates. The trigeminal, vestibular and olfactory regions of the brain were electrically stimulated to test their relative effectiveness at eliciting forelimb movement in newborn opossums, using in vitro preparations of brain-spinal cord with the limbs attached. The minimal stimulation of the cervical spinal cord needed to induce forelimb movement was considered as threshold (T). Stimulations of the trigeminal ganglion (5G) at similar to 2T and of the vestibular complex at similar to 20T could induce the same movement, and were not statistically different, in contrast to the similar to 600 T necessary for the olfactory bulb (OB). Neurofilament-200 immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing with Texas-Red conjugated Dextran Amines were used to study trigeminal innervation of the facial skin and pathways by which trigeminal inputs may be relayed to the spinal cord. Numerous nerve fibers were observed in the snout dermis, especially in the maxillary region, but also elsewhere in the head skin. Some 5G cells project to the upper spinal cord, but more project to the caudal medulla where they could contact secondary trigeminal neurons or reticular cells projecting to the spinal cord. These results support a significant influence of the trigeminal and the vestibular systems, but not of olfaction, on forelimb movement of neonatal opossums. (C) 2012 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using an active electroencephalography (EEG) system in combination with source localization algorithms, this study aimed to localize brain cortical oscillations patterns in the motor cortex and to correlate these with surface electromyography (EMG)-detected muscular activity during pedaling exercise. Eight subjects performed 2-min isokinetic (90 rpm) cycling bouts at intensities ranging from 1 to 5W kg(-1) body mass on a cycle ergometer. These bouts were interspersed by a minimum of 2 min of passive rest to limit to development of peripheral muscle fatigue. Brain cortical activity within the motor cortex was analyzed using a 32-channel active EEG system combined with source localization algorithms. EMG activity was recorded from seven muscles on each lower limb. EEG and EMG activity revealed comparatively stable oscillations across the different exercise intensities. More importantly, the oscillations in cortical activity within the motor cortex were significantly correlated with EMG activity during the high-intensity cycling bouts. This study demonstrates that it is possible to localize oscillations in brain cortical activity during moderate- to high-intensity cycling exercise using EEG in combination with source localization algorithms, and that these oscillations match the activity of the active muscles in time and amplitude. Results of this study might help to further evaluate the effects of central vs. peripheral fatigue during exercise. (C) 2012 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although opioid analgesics have been used to relieve chronic pain of different etiologies, opioids are associated with a range of side effects that may reduce patient quality of life and lead to reduced compliance with treatment. Tapentadol is a centrally acting analgesic with 2 mechanisms of action, mu-opioid receptor agonism and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, that is available in an extended-release formulation for the management of chronic pain. Objective: To review the efficacy of tapentadol extended release (ER) for the management of moderate to severe chronic nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Methods: Efficacy results are summarized for four 15-week phase 3 studies of tapentadol ER in patients with moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritis knee pain (2 studies; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00421928 and NCT00486811), low back pain (NCT00449176), and pain related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN; NCT00455520); a one-year phase 3 study of tapentadol ER in patients with moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritis pain or low back pain (NCT00361504); and a pooled analysis of data from the 15-week studies in patients with osteoarthritis knee pain or low back pain. A summary of the comparative tolerability for tapentadol ER and the active comparator used in these studies, oxycodone controlled release (CR), is provided. Results: Results of these studies showed that tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) was effective for the management of moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritis knee pain, low back pain, and pain related to DPN. Tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) has been shown to provide comparable pain relief to oxycodone HCl CR (20 - 50 mg bid) for chronic osteoarthritis knee pain and low back pain over up to one year of treatment. Tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) was associated with an improved tolerability profile, particularly gastrointestinal tolerability profile, and with lower rates of treatment discontinuations and adverse event-related discontinuations compared with oxycodone HCl CR (50 - 250 mg bid) over up to one year of treatment in patients with osteoarthritis knee pain and low back pain. Limitations: Differences in the design and duration of these phase 3 studies may limit comparisons of the efficacy results; nevertheless, this summary of efficacy results demonstrates the broad efficacy of tapentadol ER for different types of nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Conclusions: Tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) is effective for moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain, low back pain, and pain related to DPN and provides efficacy similar to that of oxycodone HCl CR (20 - 50 mg bid) for patients with osteoarthritis and low back pain. Tapentadol ER treatment has been associated with better gastrointestinal tolerability and compliance with therapy than oxycodone CR, which suggests that tapentadol ER may be a better option for the long-term management of chronic pain.

Restless legs syndrome outside the blood-brain barrier - Exacerbation by domperidone in Parkinson's disease	PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Restless legs syndrome; Parkinson's disease; Domperidone	NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS QUESTIONNAIRE; MELATONIN SYNTHESIS; SYNDROME RLS; DOPAMINE; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; NEUROPATHY; AUGMENTATION; DISORDERS; PROFILE; IRON	Introduction: Models of dopaminergic function in restless legs focus on central dopaminergic neurons. Domperidone, a peripheral dopamine blocker that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, is commonly used in Parkinson's disease. After encountering a case of restless legs syndrome that dramatically worsened with domperidone, we assessed whether Parkinson's patients may have exacerbation of restless legs with domperidone. Methods: From two Parkinson's disease cohorts, we assessed restless legs prevalence according to standard criteria, in patients taking vs. not taking domperidone. Regression analysis was performed, adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, UPDRS, dopaminergic medications and other medications. Results: One hundred eighty four patients were assessed, of whom 46 (25%) had restless legs. Thirteen out of twenty seven (48%) patients on domperidone had restless legs compared to 33/157 (21%) without (p = 0.010). Other medications were not associated with restless legs. Conclusion: This unexpected finding suggests that dopaminergic neurons outside of the blood brain barrier may be important in restless legs syndrome pathophysiology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Functional genomics of the rat neuromedin U receptor 1 reveals a naturally occurring deleterious allele. Physiol Genomics 45: 89-97, 2013. First published December 4, 2012; doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00070.2012.-Neuromedin U (NMU) plays an important role in a number of physiological processes, but the relative contribution of its two known receptors, NMUR1 and NMUR2, is still poorly understood. Here we report the existence of a SNP T-1022 -> A (Val(341)-> G) in the third exon of the rat Nmur1 gene that leads to an inactive receptor. This SNP is present within the coding region of the highly conserved NPXXY motif found within all class A type G protein-coupled receptors and translates to an NMUR1 receptor that is not expressed on the cell surface. Genetic analysis of the Nmur1 gene in a population of Sprague-Dawley rats revealed that this strain is highly heterogeneous for the inactivating polymorphism. The loss of functional NMUR1 receptors in Sprague-Dawley rats homozygous for the inactive allele was confirmed by radioligand binding studies on native tissue expressing NMUR1. The physiological relevance of this functional genomics finding was examined in two nociceptive response models. The pronociceptive effects of NMU were abolished in rats lacking functional NMUR1 receptors. The existence of naturally occurring NMUR1-deficient rats provides a novel and powerful tool to investigate the physiological role of NMU and its receptors. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of verifying the NMUR1 single nucleotide polymorphism status for rats used in physiological, pharmacological or toxicological studies conducted with NMUR1 modulators.

The host genetic background is an important risk factor for leprosy susceptibility and the PARK2 gene is a replicated leprosy susceptibility candidate gene. The protein product of PARK2, Parkin, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in the development of various forms of Parkinsonism. The human macrophage is both a natural host cell of M. leprae as well as a primary mediator of natural immune defenses, in part by secreting important pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Here, we report that down-regulation of Parkin in THP-1 macrophages, human monocyte-derived macrophages and human Schwann cells resulted in a consistent and specific decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2) production in response to mycobacteria or LPS. Interestingly, production of IL-6 at 6 hours by THP-1 cells stimulated with live M. leprae and M. bovis BCG was dependent on pretreatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (VD). Parkin knockdown in VD-treated cells blocked IL-6 induction by mycobacteria. However, I kappa B-alpha phosphorylation and levels of I kappa B-xi, a nuclear protein required for IL-6 expression, were not affected by Parkin silencing. Phosphorylation of MAPK ERK1/2 and p38 was unaffected by Parkin silencing while JNK activation was promoted but did not explain the altered cytokine production. In a final set of experiments we found that genetic risk factors of leprosy located in the PARK2 promoter region were significantly correlated with M. leprae sonicate triggered CCL2 and IL6 transcript levels in whole blood assays. These results associated genetically controlled changes in the production of MCP-1/CCL2 and IL-6 with known leprosy susceptibility factors.

Syndromic Algorithms for Detection of Gambiense Human African Trypanosomiasis in South Sudan	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							SLEEPING-SICKNESS PATIENTS; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; CLINICAL-ASPECTS; EASTERN UGANDA; DIAGNOSIS; SURVEILLANCE; EPIDEMIC; CONGO	Background: Active screening by mobile teams is considered the best method for detecting human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense but the current funding context in many post-conflict countries limits this approach. As an alternative, non-specialist health care workers (HCWs) in peripheral health facilities could be trained to identify potential cases who need testing based on their symptoms. We explored the predictive value of syndromic referral algorithms to identify symptomatic cases of HAT among a treatment-seeking population in Nimule, South Sudan. Methodology/Principal Findings: Symptom data from 462 patients (27 cases) presenting for a HAT test via passive screening over a 7 month period were collected to construct and evaluate over 14,000 four item syndromic algorithms considered simple enough to be used by peripheral HCWs. For comparison, algorithms developed in other settings were also tested on our data, and a panel of expert HAT clinicians were asked to make referral decisions based on the symptom dataset. The best performing algorithms consisted of three core symptoms (sleep problems, neurological problems and weight loss), with or without a history of oedema, cervical adenopathy or proximity to livestock. They had a sensitivity of 88.9-92.6%, a negative predictive value of up to 98.8% and a positive predictive value in this context of 8.4-8.7%. In terms of sensitivity, these out-performed more complex algorithms identified in other studies, as well as the expert panel. The best-performing algorithm is predicted to identify about 9/10 treatment-seeking HAT cases, though only 1/10 patients referred would test positive. Conclusions/Significance: In the absence of regular active screening, improving referrals of HAT patients through other means is essential. Systematic use of syndromic algorithms by peripheral HCWs has the potential to increase case detection and would increase their participation in HAT programmes. The algorithms proposed here, though promising, should be validated elsewhere.	[Palmer, Jennifer J.; Checchi, Francesco; Whitty, Christopher J.

Multiple components of eIF4F are required for protein synthesis-dependent hippocampal long-term potentiation. J Neurophysiol 109: 68-76, 2013. First published October 10, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00342.2012.-Persistent forms of synaptic plasticity are widely thought to require the synthesis of new proteins. This feature of long-lasting forms of plasticity largely has been demonstrated using inhibitors of general protein synthesis, such as either anisomycin or emetine. However, these drugs, which inhibit elongation, cannot address detailed questions about the regulation of translation initiation, where the majority of translational control occurs. Moreover, general protein synthesis inhibitors cannot distinguish between cap-dependent and cap-independent modes of translation initiation. In the present study, we took advantage of two novel compounds, 4EGI-1 and hippuristanol, each of which targets a different component of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4F initiation complex, and investigated their effects on long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. We found that 4EGI-1 and hippuristanol both attenuated long-lasting late-phase LTP induced by two different stimulation paradigms. We also found that 4EGI-1 and hippuristanol each were capable of blocking the expression of newly synthesized proteins immediately after the induction of late-phase LTP. These new pharmacological tools allow for a more precise dissection of the role played by translational control pathways in synaptic plasticity and demonstrate the importance of multiple aspects of eIF4F in processes underlying hippocampal LTP, laying the foundation for future studies investigating the role of eIF4F in hippocampus-dependent memory processes.

Reduced gait stability in high-functioning poststroke individuals. J Neurophysiol 109: 77-88, 2013. First published October 10, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00552.2012.-Falls during walking are a major cause of poststroke injury, and walking faster may decrease the ability to recover following a gait perturbation. We compared gait stability between high-functioning poststroke individuals and controls and evaluated the effect of gait speed on gait stability. Ten stroke subjects and ten age-matched controls walked on a self-paced treadmill at two speeds (matched/faster). Movement of the nonparetic/dominant leg was arrested unexpectedly at early swing. Poststroke individuals lowered the perturbed leg following perturbation (58% of cases) while controls maintained the leg elevated (49% of cases; P < 0.01). In poststroke individuals, double-support duration was restored later than in controls (4.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.3 strides; P < 0.007), and long-term phase shifts of arm and leg movements were larger and less coordinated on the paretic side. A moderate speed increase (similar to 20%) enhanced the incidence of leg lowering in controls but not in stroke subjects. Faster walkers in both groups had a more coordinated response, limited to the nonparetic side in the stroke group. However, faster walkers were not more stable following perturbation. Our results suggest that gait perturbations can target basic control processes and identify neurological locomotor deficits in individuals with fall risk. Central regulation of body translation in space is involved in recovery of steady-state walking. Impaired descending control (stroke) decreases the ability of the motor system to recover from perturbations and regulate interlimb phase relationships, especially when changing gait speed. However, interlimb coordination may not be a major factor in the recovery of gait stability.

During development axons are directed over relatively long distances by a precise extracellular distribution of chemical signals in the embryonic nervous system. Multiple guidance proteins, including netrins, slits, semaphorins, ephrins and neurotrophins have been identified as key players in this process. During the last decade, engineered cell culture substrates have been developed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying axon guidance. This review is focused on the biological insights that have been achieved using new techniques that attempt to mimic in vitro the spatial patterns of proteins that growth cones encounter in vivo.

Relaxin Family Peptides and Their Receptors. Physiol Rev 93:405-480, 2013; doi: 10.1152/physrev.00001.2012.-There are seven relaxin family peptides that are all structurally related to insulin. Relaxin has many roles in female and male reproduction, as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system, as a vasodilator and cardiac stimulant in the cardiovascular system, and as an antifibrotic agent. Insulin-like peptide-3 (INSL3) has clearly defined specialist roles in male and female reproduction, relaxin-3 is primarily a neuropeptide involved in stress and metabolic control, and INSL5 is widely distributed particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. Although they are structurally related to insulin, the relaxin family peptides produce their physiological effects by activating a group of four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), relaxin family peptide receptors 1-4 (RXFP1-4). Relaxin and INSL3 are the cognate ligands for RXFP1 and RXFP2, respectively, that are leucine-rich repeat containing GPCRs. RXFP1 activates a wide spectrum of signaling pathways to generate second messengers that include cAMP and nitric oxide, whereas RXFP2 activates a subset of these pathways. Relaxin-3 and INSL5 are the cognate ligands for RXFP3 and RXFP4 that are closely related to small peptide receptors that when activated inhibit cAMP production and activate MAP kinases. Although there are still many unanswered questions regarding the mode of action of relaxin family peptides, it is clear that they have important physiological roles that could be exploited for therapeutic benefit.

We investigated the relationship between performance on a problem-solving task and measures of reproductive success in a wild population of great tits, Parus major. We presented breeding pairs during the nestling provisioning period with a novel string-pulling task requiring the parents to remove an obstacle with their leg that temporarily blocked access to their nestbox. We found that nests where at least one parent solved the task had higher nestling survival until fledging than nests where both parents were nonsolvers. Furthermore, clutch size, hatching success and fledgling number were positively correlated with speed in solving the task. Our study suggests that natural selection may directly act on interindividual variation in problem-solving performance. In light of these results, the mechanisms maintaining between-individual variation in problem-solving performance in natural populations need further investigation.

However, the impact of excess FA intake, particularly during pregnancy, requires investigation. In a recent study, we reported that a diet supplemented with 20-fold higher FA than the recommended intake for rodents had adverse effects on embryonic mouse development at embryonic days (E)10.5 and 14.5. In this report, we examined developmental outcomes in E14.5 embryos after administering a diet supplemented with 10-fold higher FA than recommended to pregnant mice with and without a mild deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). METHODS Pregnant mice with or without a deficiency in MTHFR were fed a control diet (recommended FA intake of 2 mg/kg diet for rodents) or an FA-supplemented diet (FASD; 10-fold higher than the recommended intake [20 mg/kg diet]). At E14.5, mice were examined for embryonic loss and growth retardation, and hearts were assessed for defects and for ventricular wall thickness. RESULTS Maternal FA supplementation was associated with embryonic loss, embryonic delays, a higher incidence of ventricular septal defects, and thinner left and right ventricular walls, compared to mothers fed control diet. CONCLUSIONS Our work suggests that even moderately high levels of FA supplementation may adversely affect fetal mouse development. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate the impact of high folate intake in pregnant women. Birth Defects Research (Part A), 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Establishing a Canadian Registry of Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article								Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating cause of progressive weakness, respiratory failure and death. To date there is no effective therapy to meaningfully extend survival but continuously emerging targets and putative treatments are studied in clinical trials. Canadian epidemiological data on ALS is scarce and the socioeconomic impact of ALS on Canadian society is unclear. The Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR) is a national clinic-based registry of patients with neuromuscular diseases with the goal of facilitating the design and execution of clinical research. Methods: We conducted a national stakeholder survey to assess interest for a Canadian ALS registry and an assessment of expected case ascertainment. A dataset derivation meeting was held to establish the registry medical dataset. Results: We report the results of the national stakeholder survey, case ascertainment assessment, and the derived dataset that have resulted in the current implementation of a Canadian registry of patients with ALS. Conclusions: The development of this long sought-after resource is a significant step forward for the Canadian ALS patient and research communities that will result in more efficient clinical trial recruitment and advancements in our understanding of ALS in Canada.

However, it is essential to document the unhealthy lifestyle habits as they can exacerbate existing impairments and disabilities. The objectives are: 1) To determine the prevalence of risk factors among individuals with DM1; 2) To compare the prevalence among classic and mild phenotypes. Method: A survey was done on a sample of two-hundred (200) patients with DM1 as part of a larger study. Lifestyle risk factors included being overweight or obese, tobacco smoking, illicit drug use, excessive alcohol consumption and physical inactivity. A registered nurse administered the validated public health survey. Categorization of risk factors were based on national standards and compared with provincial and regional prevalences. Results: 50% of DM1 patients were overweight or obese, 23.6% were regular smokers, and 76% were physically inactive. Except for overweight and obesity, significant differences were observed between patients with classic and mild phenotypes for all the other lifestyle risk factors: those with the classic phenotype being more often regular smokers, consuming more often illicit drugs and being less physically active. Conclusions: The results of this study will provide guidance for the development of better adapted and focussed health promotion interventions in the future.

Diversity of ARSACS Mutations in French-Canadians	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							RECESSIVE SPASTIC ATAXIA; CHARLEVOIX-SAGUENAY ARSACS; CEREBELLAR-ATAXIA; NORTHEASTERN QUEBEC; PROTEIN SACSIN; POPULATION; NEUROPATHY; CHAPERONE; DELETION	Background: The growing number of spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (SACS) gene mutations reported worldwide has broadened the clinical phenotype of autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). The identification of Quebec ARSACS cases without two known SACS mutation led to the development of a multi-modal genomic strategy to uncover mutations in this large gene and explore phenotype variability. Methods: Search for SACS mutations by combining various methods on 20 cases with a classical French-Canadian ARSACS phenotype without two mutations and a group of 104 sporadic or recessive spastic ataxia cases of unknown cause. Western blot on lymphoblast protein from cases with different genotypes was probed to establish if they still expressed sacsin. Results: A total of 12 mutations, including 7 novels, were uncovered in Quebec ARSACS cases. The screening of 104 spastic ataxia cases of unknown cause for 98 SACS mutations did not uncover carriers of two mutations. Compounds heterozygotes for one missense SACS mutation were found to minimally express sacsin. Conclusions: The large number of SACS mutations present even in Quebec suggests that the size of the gene alone may explain the great genotypic diversity. This study does not support an expanding ARSACS phenotype in the French-Canadian population. Most mutations lead to loss of function, though phenotypic variability in other populations may reflect partial loss of function with preservation of some sacsin expression. Our results also highlight the challenge of SACS mutation screening and the necessity to develop new generation sequencing methods to ensure low cost complete gene sequencing.

We aimed to identify any adverse event (AE) associated with LCM treatment by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We also evaluated the association of serious AEs with LCM, the proportion of study withdrawals due to intolerable AEs at different LCM doses, and whether the tolerability profile of LCM differs according to the disorder in which it was investigated. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL to May 2011 for LCM RCTs. Additional studies were identified from reference lists of retrieved papers and from online clinical databases. We selected placebo-controlled, double-blind RCTs and investigated the therapeutic effects of oral LCM in adults with any condition. AEs were assessed for their association with LCM after identification/exclusion of synonyms, rare AEs, and non-assessable AEs. We used risk differences to evaluate the association of any (99% confidence intervals [CIs]) or serious AEs (95% CIs) with LCM and to investigate doseresponse relationships of identified AEs. Key Findings: Ten RCTs (three in pharmacoresistant epilepsy, four in neuropathic pain, one in migraine, one in fibromyalgia, and one in knee osteoarthritis) were included in our study. Their duration varied from 1218 weeks. The total number of patients included was 3,148. No serious AE was significantly associated with LCM treatment. Of 21 identified AEs, 11 (52%) were found to be significantly associated with LCM. The number of AEs significantly associated with LCM increased with increasing dose: one at 200 mg/day (dizziness); six at 400 mg/day (dizziness, vertigo, abnormal coordination, abnormal vision, nausea, and vomiting); nine at 600 mg/day (dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, balance disorder, diplopia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and tremor). The proportion of AE-related study withdrawals also significantly increased with increasing dose. LCM AEs tended to occur more frequently in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy compared with patients with other disorders. Significance: A range of AEs suggestive of vestibulocerebellar dysfunction is significantly associated with LCM treatment and their incidence increases with increasing doses.

The clinical implications of cognitive impairment and allostatic load in bipolar disorder	EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Bipolar disorder; Mania; Depression; Cognitive impairment; Prophylaxis; Allostatic load	NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR BDNF; CUMULATIVE BIOLOGICAL RISK; RECEPTOR MESSENGER-RNA; I DISORDER; NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION; FOLLOW-UP; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MOOD DISORDERS; CHRONIC STRESS; EUTHYMIC PATIENTS	Background: Allostatic load (AL) relates to the neural and bodily "wear and tear'' that emerge in the context of chronic stress. This paper aims to provide clinicians with a comprehensive overview of the role of AL in patophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) and its practical implications. Methods: PubMed searches were conducted on English-language articles published from 1970 to June 2011 using the search terms allostatic load, oxidative stress, staging, and bipolar disorder cross-referenced with cognitive impairment, comorbidity, mediators, prevention. Results: Progressive neural and physical dysfunction consequent to mood episodes in BD can be construed as a cumulative state of AL. The concept of AL can help to reconcile cognitive impairment and increased rates of clinical comorbidities that occur over the course of cumulative BD episodes. Conclusions: Data on transduction of psychosocial stress into the neurobiology of mood episodes converges to the concept of AL. Mood episodes prevention would not only alleviate emotional suffering, but also arrest the cycle of AL, cognitive decline, physical morbidities and, eventually, related mortality. These objectives can be achieved by focusing on effective prophylaxis from the first stages of the disorder, providing mood-stabilizing agents and standardized psychoeducation and, potentially, addressing cognitive deficits by the means of specific medication and neuropsychological interventions.

This study examined the hypothesis that AM recruits other pronociceptive mediators in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced inflammation. Injection of CFA in the hindpaw of rat produced an increase in the expression of nNOS in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and the spinal dorsal horn. An intrathecal administration of AM(22-52), but not the CGRP antagonist BIBN4096BS, abolished the CFA-induced increase of nNOS. Moreover, AM-induced increase of CGRP was inhibited by the nNOS inhibitors L-NAME and 7-nitroindazole in cultured ganglion explants. Addition of AM to ganglion cultures induced an increase in nNOS protein, which was attenuated by the PICA inhibitor H-89. Treatment with AM also concentration-dependently increased cAMP content and pPKA protein level, but not its non-phosphorylated form, in cultured ganglia. In addition, nNOS was shown to be co-localized with the AM receptor components calcitonin receptor-like receptor and receptor activity-modifying protein 2- and 3 in DRG neurons. The present study suggests that the enhanced activity of nitric oxide (NO) mediates the biological action of AM at the spinal level and that AM recruits NO-CGRP via cAMP/PKA signaling in a mechanistic pathway underlying CFA-induced hyperalgesia.

Clinically feasible MTR is sensitive to cortical demyelination in MS	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; LESIONS; BENIGN; IMAGES; DAMAGE	Objective: Presently there is no clinically feasible imaging modality that can effectively detect cortical demyelination in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The objective of this study is to determine if clinically feasible magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging is sensitive to cortical demyelination in MS. Methods: MRI were acquired in situ on 7 recently deceased patients with MS using clinically feasible sequences at 3 T, including relatively high-resolution T1-weighted and proton density-weighted images with/without a magnetization transfer pulse for calculation of MTR. The brains were rapidly removed and placed in fixative. Multiple cortical regions from each brain were immunostained for myelin proteolipid protein and classified as mostly myelinated (MMctx), mostly demyelinated (MDctx), or intermediately demyelinated (IDctx). MRIs were registered with the cortical sections so that the cortex corresponding to each cortical section could be identified, along with adjacent subcortical white matter (WM). Mean cortical MTR normalized to mean WM MTR was calculated for each cortical region. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test if mean normalized cortical MTR was significantly lower in demyelinated cortex. Results: We found that mean normalized cortical MTR was significantly lower in cortical tissue with any demyelination (IDctx or MDctx) compared to MMctx (demyelinated cortex: least-squares mean [LSM] = 0.797, SE = 0.007; MMctx: LSM = 0.837, SE = 0.006; p = 0.01, n = 89). Conclusions: This result demonstrates that clinically feasible MTR imaging is sensitive to cortical demyelination and suggests that MTR will be a useful tool to help detect MS cortical lesions in living patients with MS.

Propranolol Use in PHACE Syndrome with Cervical and Intracranial Arterial Anomalies: Collective Experience in 32 Infants	PEDIATRIC DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							CEREBRAL VASCULOPATHY; AIRWAY HEMANGIOMAS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; BETA-BLOCKADE; CASE SERIES; DRUG CLASS; STROKE; ASSOCIATION; MIGRAINE; DISEASE	The objective of this retrospective study of patients evaluated between July 2008 and October 2011 in seven pediatric dermatology centers was to combine collective clinical experience using oral propranolol therapy in 32 infants with PHACE syndrome (Posterior fossa [brain malformations present at birth], Hemangioma [usually covering a large area of the skin of the head or neck >5 cm]; Arterial lesions [abnormalities of the blood vessels in the neck or head]; Cardiac abnormalities or aortic coarctation [abnormalities of the heart or blood vessels that are attached to the heart]; Eye abnormalities) with cervical or intracranial arterial anomalies. Patients were given an average daily dose of oral propranolol of 1.8 mg/kg divided two or three times per day for an average duration of 12.3 months. The main outcome measure was adverse neurologic events. Seven (22%) patients were categorized as being at higher risk for stroke, defined on magnetic resonance imaging as severe, long-segment narrowing or nonvisualization of major cerebral or cervical vessels without anatomic evidence of collateral circulation, often in the presence of concomitant cardiovascular comorbidities. Only one patient developed a change in neurologic status during propranolol treatment: mild right hemiparesis that remained static and improved while propranolol was continued. An additional three patients had worsening hemangioma ulceration or tissue necrosis during therapy. This is the largest report thus far of patients with PHACE syndrome treated with propranolol. Although no catastrophic neurologic events occurred, serious complications, particularly severe ulcerations, were seen in a minority of patients, and given the sample size, we cannot exclude the possibility that propranolol could augment the risk of stroke in this population. We propose radiologic criteria that may prove useful in defining PHACE patients as being at high or standard risk for stroke. We continue to advise caution in using systemic beta-blockers, particularly for children with vascular anomalies at higher risk for stroke. Use of the lowest possible dosage, slow dosage titration, three times per day dosing to minimize abrupt changes in blood pressure, and close follow-up, including neurologic consultation as needed, are recommended.

Moreover, during the processing of aversive and self-referential stimuli, mindful awareness is associated with reduced medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activity, a central default mode network (DMN) component. However, it remains unclear whether mindfulness practice influences functional connectivity between DMN regions and, if so, whether such impact persists beyond a state of meditation. Consequently, this study examined the effect of extensive mindfulness training on functional connectivity within the DMN during a restful state. Resting-state data were collected from 13 experienced meditators (with over 1000 h of training) and 11 beginner meditators (with no prior experience, trained for 1 week before the study) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Pairwise correlations and partial correlations were computed between DMN seed regions' time courses and were compared between groups utilizing a Bayesian sampling scheme. Relative to beginners, experienced meditators had weaker functional connectivity between DMN regions involved in self-referential processing and emotional appraisal. In addition, experienced meditators had increased connectivity between certain DMN regions (e.g. dorso-medial PFC and right inferior parietal lobule), compared to beginner meditators. These findings suggest that meditation training leads to functional connectivity changes between core DMN regions possibly reflecting strengthened present-moment awareness.

Exposure to Valproic Acid Inhibits Chondrogenesis and Osteogenesis in Mid-Organogenesis Mouse Limbs	TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						teratogen; histone deacetylase inhibitor; Sox9; Runx2	HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS; SOX9 GENE; EXPRESSION; DIFFERENTIATION; TERATOGENICITY; MALFORMATIONS; OSSIFICATION; CHONDROCYTES; DEFECTS; PATHWAY	In utero exposure to valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, causes neural tube, heart, and limb defects. Valpromide (VPD), the amide derivative of VPA, does not inhibit HDAC activity and is a weak teratogen in vivo. The detailed mechanism of action of VPA as a teratogen is not known. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that VPA disrupts regulation of the expression of genes that are critical in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during limb development. Murine gestation day-12 embryonic forelimbs were excised and exposed to VPA or VPD in a limb bud culture system. VPA caused a significant concentration- dependent increase in limb abnormalities, which was correlated with its HDAC inhibitory effect. The signaling of both Sox9 and Runx2, key regulators of chondrogenesis, was downregulated by VPA. In contrast, VPD had little effect on limb morphology and no significant effect on HDAC activity or the expression of marker genes. Thus, VPA exposure dysregulated the expression of target genes directly involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in the developing limb. Disturbances in these signaling pathways are likely to be a consequence of HDAC inhibition because VPD did not affect their expressions.

Maternal in utero exposure to the endocrine disruptor di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate affects the blood pressure of adult male offspring	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Adrenal gland; Phthalate; Aldosterone; Systolic pressure; Activity	CARE-UNIT INFANTS; TESTOSTERONE PRODUCTION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; MALE RATS; METABOLITES; DI(2-ETHYLHEXYL)PHTHALATE; MONOESTERS; NEURONS; BRAIN; CELLS	Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is used industrially to add flexibility to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polymers and is ubiquitously found in the environment, with evidence of prenatal, perinatal and early infant exposure in humans. In utero exposure to DEHP decreases circulating testosterone levels in the adult rat. In addition, DEHP reduces the expression of the angiotensin II receptors in the adrenal gland, resulting in decreased circulating aldosterone levels. The latter may have important effects on water and electrolyte balance as well as systemic arterial blood pressure. Therefore, we determined the effects of in utero exposure to DEHP on systemic arterial blood pressure in the young (2 month-old) and older (6.5 month-old) adult rats. Sprague-Dawley pregnant dams were exposed from gestational day 14 until birth to 300 mg DEHP/kg/day. Blood pressure, heart rate, and activity data were collected using an intra-aortal transmitter in the male offspring at postnatal day (PND) 60 and PND200. A low (0.01%) and high-salt (8%) diet was used to challenge the animals at PND200. In utero exposure to DEHP resulted in reduced activity at PND60. At PND200, systolic and diastolic systemic arterial pressures as well as activity were reduced in response to DEHP exposure. This is the first evidence showing that in utero exposure to DEHP has cardiovascular and behavioral effects in the adult male offspring. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Arguelles, D. B.

J	Malhotra, M; Tomaro-Duchesneau, C; Prakash, S				Malhotra, Meenakshi; Tomaro-Duchesneau, Catherine; Prakash, Satya			Synthesis of TAT peptide-tagged PEGylated chitosan nanoparticles for siRNA delivery targeting neurodegenerative diseases	BIOMATERIALS			English	Article						Chitosan; PEG; TAT; siRNA; Nanoparticles; Gene delivery	POLY(ETHYLENE GLYCOL); RNA INTERFERENCE; GENE DELIVERY; GROWTH-FACTOR; BRAIN CANCER; DERIVATIVES; RECEPTOR; CELLS; THERAPEUTICS; PERSPECTIVES	Delivery of therapeutic molecules to the brain for the treatment of Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) is a challenging task. This manuscript introduces a novel scheme of synthesizing peptide-tagged polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated chitosan polymer to develop nanoparticles for siRNA delivery for use in ND. Specifically, this manuscript proposes a facile chemoselective conjugation of monomethoxy PEG, at the C2 hydroxyl group of chitosan polymer, with conjugation of PEG to a cell-penetrating peptide, Trans-Activator of Transcription. The synthesized Chitosan-PEG-TAT polymer was used to form the nanoparticles of approximately 5 nm, complexing siRNA to be delivered in neuronal cells (Neuro 2a), with no/minimal toxicity. The various intermediates and the final product formed during the synthesis were characterized using H-1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy spectra. The morphological details of the nanoparticles were studied using Transmission Electron Microscopy. The nanoparticles were tested to deliver a functional siRNA against the Ataxin-1 gene in an in-vitro established model of a ND Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1) over-expressing ataxin protein. The results indicate successful suppression of the SCA1 protein following 48 h of transfection. Result of this study has potential in ND like SCA, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and others.

Objective measurement of physiological signal-to-noise gain in the brainstem response to a synthetic vowel	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Speech-evoked potentials; Speech auditory brainstem response; Vowel; Noise; Stochastic resonance; Noise suppression	FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSES; AUDITORY-NERVE FIBERS; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; BACKGROUND-NOISE; CORTICOFUGAL MODULATION; TEMPORAL INTEGRATION; COCHLEAR-NERVE; SPEECH; REPRESENTATION; PERCEPTION	Objective: This work investigates auditory speech processing in normal listeners through measurement of brainstem responses to the synthetic vowel /a/. Methods: The vowel is presented in quiet and in continuous white noise with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of + 5, 0, - 5, and - 10 dB. Results: In the presence of noise, transient response waves V and A are delayed when compared to those evoked in quiet, whereas the amplitude of wave V and the steepness of the slope between waves V and A are strongly reduced. The spectral component of the steady-state evoked response corresponding to the fundamental frequency (F0) of the vowel shows significantly greater amplitude and local SNR in the less severe noise conditions compared to the quiet condition. Such increases of the amplitude and SNR were not observed for the spectral component corresponding to the first formant of the vowel (F1). Conclusions: Results suggest that, at F0, both local noise suppression and signal enhancement contribute to the SNR gain. There is suppression of local noise near F1, but no signal enhancement. Significance: The physiological SNR gain was estimated to be approximately + 12 dB at both F0 and F1, as stimulus SNR was reduced from + 5 to - 10 dB.

Immunologic privilege in the central nervous system and the blood-brain barrier	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Review						blood-brain barrier; multiple sclerosis; neuroimaging; neuroinflammation; neurovascular unit	FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; ADVANCE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH; CONVECTION-ENHANCED DELIVERY; LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISORDERS; RAT CHOROID-PLEXUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; DENDRITIC CELLS; T-CELLS; MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS IIIB	The brain is in many ways an immunologically and pharmacologically privileged site. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) of the cerebrovascular endothelium and its participation in the complex structure of the neurovascular unit (NVU) restrict access of immune cells and immune mediators to the central nervous system (CNS). In pathologic conditions, very well-organized immunologic responses can develop within the CNS, raising important questions about the real nature and the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of this immune privilege. We assess the interactions of immune cells and immune mediators with the BBB and NVU in neurologic disease, cerebrovascular disease, and intracerebral tumors. The goals of this review are to outline key scientific advances and the status of the science central to both the neuroinflammation and CNS barriers fields, and highlight the opportunities and priorities in advancing brain barriers research in the context of the larger immunology and neuroscience disciplines. This review article was developed from reports presented at the 2011 Annual Blood-Brain Barrier Consortium Meeting.

Design: Multicenter retrospective chart review. Setting: Four Canadian PICUs. Patients: All deaths from 1999 to 2003 were screened. Patients included were 36 wks corrected gestation to 17 yrs old and had at least one brain death examination documented in the chart. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Medical records were reviewed to determine demographics, results of the brain death examinations, ancillary tests, and time intervals between injury event, fixed dilated pupils, first brain death examination, second brain death examination, and terminal event. Discordance between brain death examinations was defined as the medical conclusion documented in the chart as brain death followed by no brain death. Prespecified subgroups were age < 1 yr vs. >= 1 yr and organ donor vs. nonorgan donor. Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon and unpaired t tests compared time intervals between subgroups; p value <= 0.05 was considered significant. Of those screened, 135 of 907 (15%) met the study eligibility criteria and 110 of 135 (81%) had at least two brain death examinations. The prevalence of discordance between brain death examinations was 1 of 110 (0.91%) (95% confidence interval < 0.01%-5.5%). In those who had two apnea tests, the prevalence of discordance between brain death examinations was 1 of 63 (1.6%) (95% confidence interval < 0.01%-9.3%). Twenty-five (19%) patients had only one brain death examination, and one of these became an organ donor without ancillary testing. Twenty-four (18%) patients did not have an apnea test. Of the 48 (36%) who had only one apnea test, 16 became organ donors without any ancillary test. Patients < 1 yr old had a longer time interval between the first and second brain death examinations than those > 1 yr old. Conclusions: Some brain death diagnoses were not based on two examinations, and some did not include an apnea test. In patients who had two brain death examinations, discordant results were uncommon.

However, by virtue of its reciprocal connections with the orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the NRe may also be involved in aspects of executive inhibition. To date, there has been no systematic attempt to examine the role of the NRe in inhibitory mechanisms of response control. Accordingly, we compared rats with neurotoxic lesions of the NRe with sham surgery controls on performance of the 5-choice reaction time task, a test of visuospatial attention and inhibitory control. When tested post-operatively, rats with NRe lesions were unable to actively inhibit premature responses when the intertrial interval was varied. However, the same rats with NRe lesions showed normal inhibition of perseverative responses, and under some conditions were less perseverative than shams. The NRe lesion was also associated with a reduction in omissions and fast reward collection latencies, which persisted 2 months following surgery. The NRe lesion did not affect response accuracy or latency to respond correctly throughout the course of experimental testing. Together, these results signify the important role of the NRe in impulse inhibition, especially when slight changes are made to the temporal demands of the environment, and reveal the potential contribution of the NRe in motivational processes.

This study compares two different mathematical approaches for the computation of transfer matrices used to solve the EEG inverse problem. Forward transfer matrices relating dipole sources to scalp potentials are determined via conventional and reciprocal approaches using individual, realistically shaped head models. The reciprocal approach entails calculating the electric field at the dipole position when scalp electrodes are reciprocally energized with unit current-scalp potentials are obtained from the scalar product of this electric field and the dipole moment. Median nerve stimulation is performed on three healthy subjects and single-dipole inverse solutions for the N-20-P-20 SEPs are then obtained by simplex minimization and validated against the primary sensory hand area identified on magnetic resonance images. Solutions are presented for different time points, filtering strategies, boundary-element method discretizations, and skull conductivity values. Both approaches produce similarly small position errors for the N-20-P-20 SEP. Position error for single-dipole inverse solutions is inherently robust to inaccuracies in forward transfer matrices but dependent on the overlapping activity of other neural sources. Significantly smaller time and storage requirements are the principal advantages of the reciprocal approach. Reduced computational requirements and similar dipole position accuracy support the use of reciprocal approaches over conventional approaches for N-20-P-20 SEP source localization.

The developmental genetics of Hirschsprung's disease. Clin Genet 2013: 83: 15-22. (C) John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2012 Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), also known as aganglionic megacolon, derives from a congenital malformation of the enteric nervous system (ENS). It displays an incidence of 1 in 5000 live births with a 4: 1 male to female sex ratio. Clinical signs include severe constipation and distended bowel due to a non-motile colon. If left untreated, aganglionic megacolon is lethal. This severe congenital condition is caused by the absence of colonic neural ganglia and thus lack of intrinsic innervation of the colon due in turn to improper colonization of the developing intestines by ENS progenitor cells. These progenitor cells are derived from a transient stem cell population called neural crest cells (NCC). The genetics of HSCR is complex and can involve mutations in multiple genes. However, it is estimated that mutations in known genes account for less than half of the cases of HSCR observed clinically. The male sex bias is currently unexplained. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the pathophysiology and genetics of HSCR, within the context of our current knowledge of NCC development, sex chromosome genetics and laboratory models.

Overall, studies in humans and other animals highlight the key role of the amygdala in the detection and evaluation of stimuli with affective value. Nonetheless, contradictory findings have been reported, especially in terms of the exact role of this structure in the processing of different emotions, giving rise to different neural models of emotion. For instance, although the amygdala has traditionally been considered as exclusively involved in fear (and possibly anger), more recent work suggests that it may be important for processing other types of emotions, and even nonemotional information. A review of the main findings in this field is presented here, together with some of the hypotheses that have been put forward to interpret this literature and explain its inconsistencies.

In the present experiment, observers were required to respond as fast as possible to (1) lateralized visual or tactile targets presented alone, (2) double stimulation within the same modality or (3) double stimulation across modalities. Each combination was either delivered within the same hemispace (spatially aligned) or in different hemispaces (spatially misaligned). Results show that the redundancy gains (RG) obtained from the cross-modal conditions were far greater than those obtained from combinations of two visual or two tactile targets. Consistently, we observed that the reaction time distributions of cross-modal targets, but not those of within-modal targets, surpass the predicted reaction time distribution based on the summed probability distributions of each constituent stimulus presented alone. Moreover, we found that the spatial alignment of the targets did not influence the RG obtained in cross-modal conditions, whereas within-modal stimuli produced a greater RG when the targets where delivered in separate hemispaces. These results suggest that within-modal and cross-modal integration are not only distinguishable by the amount of facilitation they produce, but also by the spatial configuration under which this facilitation occurs. Our study strongly supports the notion that estimates of the same event that are more independent produce enhanced integrative gains.

Three template-based brain MRI segmentation techniques were compared to determine the best strategy for segmenting the deep brain structures of patients with Parkinson's disease. T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image templates were created by averaging MR images of 57 patients with Parkinson's disease. Twenty-four deep brain structures were manually segmented on the templates. To validate the template-based segmentation, 14 of the 24 deep brain structures from the templates were manually segmented on 10 MR scans of Parkinson's patients as a gold standard. We compared the manual segmentations with three methods of automated segmentation: two registration-based approaches, automatic nonlinear image matching and anatomical labeling (ANIMAL) and symmetric image normalization (SyN), and one patch-label fusion technique. The automated labels were then compared with the manual labels using a Dice-kappa metric and center of gravity. A Friedman test was used to compare the Dice-kappa values and paired t tests for the center of gravity. The Friedman test showed a significant difference between the three methods for both thalami (p < 0.05) and not for the subthalamic nuclei. Registration with ANIMAL was better than with SyN for the left thalamus and was better than the patch-based method for the right thalamus. Although template-based approaches are the most used techniques to segment basal ganglia by warping onto MR images, we found that the patch-based method provided similar results and was less time-consuming. Patch-based method may be preferable for the subthalamic nucleus segmentation in patients with Parkinson's disease.	[Haegelen, Claire; Coupe, Pierrick; Fonov, Vladimir; Guizard, Nicolas; Collins, D.

Reactivity was prospectively studied postmortem in sections of the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra in 172 normal human fetuses and neonates of 6 to 41 weeks' gestation. Caudate nucleus and putamen show patchy reactivity beginning at 13 weeks' gestation around some intracapsular neurons; the pattern is well developed in all regions before midgestation. Near-uniform reactivity throughout the striatum is achieved by 34 weeks, but subtle patchiness is still perceived at term. The globus pallidus shows uniform reactivity without stria from 13 weeks and the substantia nigra from 9 weeks. Synaptic patchiness in the fetal corpus striatum appears to correspond to the "striosomes of Graybiel" that define adjacent neurotransmitter-rich and neurotransmitter-poor zones. Clinical correlation is proposed with dystonic postures and athetoid movements observed in normal preterm neonates of 26 to 32 weeks.

In the absence of curative chemotherapy this invasion, beyond surgical and radiotherapy margins, to distant brain sites is thought to be an important cause of treatment failure. Paradoxically, studies analyzing failure patterns have consistently shown that the large majority of failures occur at the original tumor site. This conflict may be explained by the fact these cancers are often only sub-totally resected and radiotherapy and chemotherapies fail to control this significant local cancer burden. We analyzed the failure pattern in 20 consecutive patients with complete resection of the gadolinium-enhancing portion of GBM demonstrated on the immediate post-operative magnetic resonance study, and who underwent a radical course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We found that recurrences occurred only at the resection margin in 17 of 20 patients. Recurrences were exclusively distant in 2 of 20 patients and occurred at both the resection margin and a distant site in 1 of 20 cases. We found that even in cases of complete resection of the gadolinium-enhancing portion of GBM 85 % of recurrences are localized to the resection margin.

Fast diffusion tensor imaging and tractography of the whole cervical spinal cord using point spread function corrected echo planar imaging	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						spinal cord; diffusion tensor imaging; tractography; point spread function	DISTORTION CORRECTION; IN-VIVO; TRACKING; BRAIN; DTI; INDIVIDUALS; DISABILITY; ATROPHY; INJURY; MOTION	Diffusion tensor imaging has been used in a number of spinal cord studies, but severe distortions caused by susceptibility induced field inhomogeneities limit its applicability to investigate small volumes within acceptable acquisition times. A way to evaluate image distortions is to map the point spread function of the voxel intensity in a reference scan. In this study, the point spread function was mapped for an echo-planar imaging sequence in the human cervical spinal cord with isotropic resolution and large field of view. Correction with the point spread function map improved anatomical consistency, and full cervical tractography was thereby possible from a C1 seed region in healthy controls and one individual with spinal cord injury. It is suggested that point spread function mapping of the spinal cord can be used in combination with sequence-based methods for reduction of susceptibility artifacts or in high-field imaging settings where off-resonance effects are pronounced.

The number and volume of lesions have been used to evaluate MS disease burden, to track the progression of the disease and to evaluate the effect of new pharmaceuticals in clinical trials. Accurate identification of MS lesions in MR images is extremely difficult due to variability in lesion location, size and shape in addition to anatomical variability between subjects. Since manual segmentation requires expert knowledge, is time consuming and is subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, many methods have been proposed to automatically segment lesions. The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the state of the art in automated multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation. From 1240 hits found initially with PubMed and Google scholar, our selection criteria identified 80 papers that described an automatic lesion segmentation procedure applied to MS. Only 47 of these included quantitative validation with at least one realistic image. In this paper, we describe the complexity of lesion segmentation, classify the automatic MS lesion segmentation methods found, and review the validation methods applied in each of the papers reviewed. Although many segmentation solutions have been proposed, including some with promising results using MRI data obtained on small groups of patients, no single method is widely employed due to performance issues related to the high variability of MS lesion appearance and differences in image acquisition. The challenge remains to provide segmentation techniques that work in all cases regardless of the type of MS, duration of the disease, or MRI protocol, and this within a comprehensive, standardized validation framework. MS lesion segmentation remains an open problem. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Garcia-Lorenzo, Daniel; Francis, Simon; Narayanan, Sridar; Arnold, Douglas L.; Collins, D.

However, age-related differences in brain activation patterns in more than one attentional control task have rarely been studied in the same group of participants. In this study, younger and older adults completed a modified Stroop task with interference and switching conditions, using functional near infra-red spectroscopy. While interference did not reveal any significant activation of the prefrontal cortex in younger adults, switching produced an increased activation bilaterally in both the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). In older adults, an isolated right and left anterior DLPFC activation was observed even in the non-executive conditions of the Stroop task (color denomination) and the interference condition revealed activation mostly in the posterior left DLPFC and bilateral VLPFC with a small right anterior DLPFC component. Specific to older adults, switching induced an increased activation spread out bilaterally over the prefrontal cortex in the bilateral anterior DLPFC, the posterior left DLPFC and bilateral VLPFC. These results suggest that for both older and younger adults, inhibition and switching are associated with distinct patterns of prefrontal activation and that age-related differences exist in these patterns such that prefrontal activation seems to be more spread out at different sites in older adults.

The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that children with ADHD exposed to MSDP show a distinctive clinical and neurocognitive profile when compared with unexposed children. Four hundred and thirty-six children diagnosed with ADHD were stratified by exposure to MSDP and compared with regard to severity of illness, comorbidity, IQ, and executive function as assessed by a battery of neuropsychological tests. All comparisons were adjusted for socioeconomic status, ethnicity, mother's age at child's birth, and maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Exposed children had more severe behavioral problems with greater externalizing symptoms and more conduct and oppositional defiant disorder items, lower verbal IQ, and a sluggish cognitive profile on the Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Linear regression analyses revealed a dose-response relationship between the average number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy and verbal IQ, CPT omission errors T score and several other clinical variables. These results suggest that MSDP is associated with a more severe form of ADHD, characterized by more severe clinical manifestations and poorer neuropsychological performance. This phenotypic signature associated with MSDP may help to identify a more homogenous subgroup of children with ADHD.

Recent evidence with humans, however, suggests that chronic food restriction rather than acute food deprivation is related to increases in drug taking and relapse, emphasizing a need for an animal model to elucidate the neural mechanisms mediating the effects of chronic food restriction on drug seeking. Here we studied the effects of chronic food restriction during a period of abstinence on heroin seeking in rats. Rats were trained to self-administer heroin over 10 days (0.1 mg/kg/infusion; i.v.). Rats were then removed from the operant conditioning chambers and exposed to a mild food restriction (resulting in 10-15 % decrease in body weight) or given unrestricted access to food for 14 days while abstinent. The abstinence period was followed by a drug-seeking test under extinction conditions. Subsequent experiments manipulated the length of restriction and test conditions. Rats that were food restricted throughout the abstinence period demonstrated a robust increase in cue-induced heroin seeking compared to sated rats. Re-feeding prior to testing or decreasing the length of the food restriction period prevented the augmentation of drug seeking. A combination of chronic food restriction and a concurrent state of hunger appears to be necessary for an increase in cue-induced heroin seeking following abstinence. The procedure presented here may serve as a useful model to study the increased risk for relapse following dietary manipulations in abstinent subjects.

J	Melzack, R; Katz, J				Melzack, Ronald; Katz, Joel			Pain	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Review							PHANTOM LIMBS; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; PREEMPTIVE ANALGESIA; SPINAL-CORD; PREVENTIVE ANALGESIA; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; EPIDURAL ANALGESIA; PERSISTENT PAIN; NERVE INJURY; STIMULATION	Pain has many valuable functions. It often signals injury or disease, generates a wide range of adaptive behaviors, and promotes healing through rest. Despite these beneficial aspects of pain, there are negative features that challenge our understanding of the puzzle of pain, including persistent phantom limb pain after amputation or total spinal cord transection. Pain is a personal, subjective experience influenced by cultural learning, the meaning of the situation, attention, and other psychological variables. Pain processes do not begin with the stimulation of receptors. Rather, injury or disease produces neural signals that enter an active nervous system that (in the adult organism) is the substrate of past experience, culture, and a host of other environmental and personal factors. These brain processes actively participate in the selection, abstraction, and synthesis of information from the total sensory input. Pain is not simply the end product of a linear sensory transmission system; it is a dynamic process that involves continuous interactions among complex ascending and descending systems. The neuromatrix theory guides us away from the Cartesian concept of pain as a sensation produced by injury, inflammation, or other tissue pathology and toward the concept of pain as a multidimensional experience produced by multiple influences. These influences range from the existing synaptic architecture of the neuromatrixwhich is determined by genetic and sensory factorsto influences from within the body and from other areas in the brain. Genetic influences on synaptic architecture may determineor predispose towardthe development of chronic pain syndromes.

Fish were captured during the dry season, from two aquatic systems in different regions (Lake Nabugabo and Mpanga River). Within the Lake Nabugabo region, individuals were sampled from Lake Kayanja (normoxic) and Lwamunda Swamp (hypoxic): within the Mpanga River system, individuals were sampled from Bunoga and Kahunge (characterized by seasonal variation in dissolved oxygen (DO.)). Enzyme activity levels of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and cytochrome C oxidase were measured in four tissues: white skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and liver. Two additional enzymes were measured in the liver, malate dehydrogenase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. Regional differences between enzyme activities in most tissues were evident; however, little variation was observed between two sites within a region despite differences in D.O. In general, P. multicolor from the Mpanga River system displayed greater anaerobic enzyme activity in white skeletal muscle, lower gluconeogenic enzyme activity in the liver, and an overall higher enzyme activity in the heart and brain tissues than fish from the Nabugabo region. The latter may reflect a long-term adaptation to low-oxygen conditions at the metapopulation level in the Nabugabo region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Brainstem Auditory Responses to Resolved and Unresolved Harmonics of a Synthetic Vowel in Quiet and Noise	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article							FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSES; 2 PITCH MECHANISMS; COMPLEX TONES; FUNDAMENTAL-FREQUENCY; SPEECH; DISCRIMINATION; REPRESENTATION; PERCEPTION; SYLLABLES; SALIENCE	Objectives: This study investigated speech auditory brainstem responses (speech ABR) with variants of a synthetic vowel in quiet and in background noise. Its objectives were to study the noise robustness of the brainstem response at the fundamental frequency F0 and at the first formant F1, evaluate how the resolved/unresolved harmonics regions in speech contribute to the response at F0, and investigate the origin of the response at F0 to resolved and unresolved harmonics in speech. Design: In total, 18 normal-hearing subjects (11 women, aged 18-33 years) participated in this study. Speech ABRs were recorded using variants of a 300 msec formant-synthesized /a/ vowel in quiet and in white noise. The first experiment employed three variants containing the first three formants F1 to F3, F1 only, and F2 and F3 only with relative formant levels following those reported in the literature. The second experiment employed three variants containing F1 only, F2 only, and F3 only, with the formants equalized to the same level and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maintained at -5 dB. Overall response latency was estimated, and the amplitude and local SNR of the envelope following response at F0 and of the frequency following response at F1 were compared for the different stimulus variants in quiet and in noise. Results: The response at F0 was more robust to noise than that at F1. There were no statistically significant differences in the response at F0 caused by the three stimulus variants in both experiments in quiet. However, the response at F0 with the variant dominated by resolved harmonics was more robust to noise than the response at F0 with the stimulus variants dominated by unresolved harmonics. The latencies of the responses in all cases were very similar in quiet, but the responses at F0 due to resolved and unresolved harmonics combined nonlinearly when both were present in the stimulus. Conclusions: Speech ABR has been suggested as a marker of central auditory processing. The results of this study support earlier work on the differential susceptibility to noise of the F0 and F1 components of the evoked response. In the case of F0, the results support the view that in speech, the pitch of resolved harmonics and that of unresolved harmonics are processed in different but interacting pathways that converge in the upper brainstem. Pitch plays an important role in speech perception, and speech ABR can offer a window into the neural extraction of the pitch of speech and how it may change with hearing impairment.

The first analysis involved the creation of a likelihood map illustrating brain activation common across studies using noxious stimuli. The left thalamus, right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral anterior insulae, and left dorsal posterior insula had the highest likelihood of being activated. The second analysis contrasted noxious cold with noxious heat stimulation and revealed higher likelihood of activation to noxious cold in the subgenual ACC and the amygdala. The third analysis assessed the implications of using either a warm stimulus or a resting baseline as the control condition to reveal activation attributed to noxious heat. Comparing noxious heat to warm stimulation led to peak ALE values that were restricted to cortical regions with known nociceptive input. The fourth analysis tested for a hemispheric dominance in pain processing and showed the importance of the right hemisphere, with the strongest ALE peaks and clusters found in the right insula and ACC. The fifth analysis compared noxious muscle with cutaneous stimuli and the former type was more likely to evoke activation in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices, precuneus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum. In general, results indicate that some brain regions such as the thalamus, insula and ACC have a significant likelihood of activation regardless of the type of noxious stimuli, while other brain regions show a stimulus-specific likelihood of being activated.

AD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder. Thus, epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression might have an important role in AD. CNP (2',3'-Cyclic Nucleotide 3' Phosphodiesterase) gene encodes a protein used as an index of myelin alterations. DPYSL2 (Dihydropyrimidinase-like 2) is described as acting in structural and regulatory processes in the central nervous system, such as neural differentiation, neurotransmitter release, and stabilization of microtubules. In this study, we evaluated gene expression and epigenetic regulation of CNP and DPYSL2 genes in three postmortem brain regions (entorhinal and auditory cortices and hippocampus) of AD patients and healthy elderly controls. mRNA quantification was performed using qRT-PCR, and promoter DNA methylation patterns were determined by mass spectrometry using the Sequenom EpiTYPER platform. We observed CNP mRNA downregulation in entorhinal and auditory cortex in relation to the same regions of the control group. CNP alterations in the brain might suggest impairment in myelination leading to a synaptic and cognition loss.

However, longitudinal neuroimaging studies are typically confined to children who have already been diagnosed with ADHD. In a population-based study, we aimed to characterize the prospective association between brain structures measured during infancy and executive function and attention deficit/hyperactivity problems assessed at preschool age. Methods: In the Generation R Study, the corpus callosum length, the gangliothalamic ovoid diameter (encompassing the basal ganglia and thalamus), and the ventricular volume were measured in 784 6-week-old children using cranial postnatal ultrasounds. Parents rated executive functioning at 4 years using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version in five dimensions: inhibition, shifting, emotional control, working memory, and planning/organizing. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems were assessed at ages 3 and 5 years using the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: A smaller corpus callosum length during infancy was associated with greater deficits in executive functioning at 4 years. This was accounted for by higher problem scores on inhibition and emotional control. The corpus callosum length during infancy did not predict Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problem at 3 and 5 years, when controlling for the confounders. We did not find any relation between gangliothalamic ovoid diameter and executive function or Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problem. Conclusions: Variations in brain structures detectible in infants predicted subtle impairments in inhibition and emotional control. However, in this population-based study, we could not demonstrate that early structural brain variations precede symptoms of ADHD.

The classical form is characterized by the association of hypomyelination, abnormal dentition, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but the recent identification of 2 genes responsible for the syndrome demonstrates that these 3 main characteristics can be variably combined among "Pol-III (polymerase III) Yrelated leukodystrophies.'' The pathophysiology of this group of diseases is still to be elucidated, and there are no neuropathologic descriptions of brain tissue. We report the clinical, neuroradiologic, and neuropathologic findings of a patient affected by 4H syndrome with confirmed POLR3A mutations. We found a marked loss of oligodendrocytes, varying in severity in different brain regions, and accompanied by severe loss of myelin, moderately severe loss of axons, and patchy perivascular regions of better preserved white matter. There was relatively mild white matter astrogliosis and microgliosis. A macrophage reaction involving viable normal-appearing oligodendroglia suggests the possibility of an immunologic process in this disorder. Cortical laminar astrogliosis and mineralization of Layers I and II in particular were present. Thus, despite the uniformly hypomyelinating pattern seen on magnetic resonance imaging, neuropathologic examination reveals a complex heterogeneous leukodystrophy with prominent neuroaxonal and glial involvement in this disorder.

P.; Binik, Yitzchak M.; Amsel, Rhonda; Carrier, Serge			Is a Sexual Dysfunction Domain Important for Quality of Life in Men with Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome? Signs "UPOINT" to Yes	JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article						prostate; prostatitis; pain; questionnaires; erectile dysfunction	PROSTATITIS SYMPTOM INDEX; IMPROVE CORRELATION; ERECTILE DOMAIN; OUTCOME MEASURE; VALIDATION; SF-36; CLASSIFICATION; QUESTIONNAIRE; PREVALENCE; INCLUSION	Purpose: Clinical phenotyping to guide treatment for urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a promising strategy. The UPOINT (urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurological/systemic and tenderness of the pelvic floor) phenotyping system evaluates men and women on 6 domains. However, this study focused on men only. Due to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in men with urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome, debate exists about the usefulness of adding an (S) (sexual dysfunction) domain to UPOINT. We examined the usefulness in terms of quality of life and delineated urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome subcategories using UPOINT(S) domains. Materials and Methods: We assessed 162 men using UPOINT criteria and after adding the sexual dysfunction domain. Using multiple regression analysis UPOINT(S) criteria were then compared to quality of life, as measured by the SF-36 (R) health outcome survey and Chronic Prostatitis Symptoms Index. Sample subgroups were assessed using k--means cluster analysis. Results: The total number of UPOINT(S) domains correlated with SF--36 and Chronic Prostatitis Symptoms Index scores. Using regression analysis the 2 significant predictors of SF--36 scores were the psychosocial and sexual domains. Men with sexual dysfunction had significantly worse quality of life than men without the condition. In addition, 6 potentially clinically meaningful subgroups were identified using cluster analysis. Sexual dysfunction was differentially present in these groups. Conclusions: Adding a sexual dysfunction domain to UPOINT may help improve quality of life in men treated for urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome.	[Davis, Seth N.

First, we use a poly-D-lysine-coated bead attached to an AFM tip to induce the recruitment of two synaptic proteins, bassoon and synaptophysin, and measure their absolute arrival times to the presynaptic department. We find that bassoon arrives before synaptophysin. Second, we observe the formation of very long (several 10s of mu m), structured, protein-containing membranous strings as the AFM tip was withdrawn from the axon. It is conceivable that these strings might be a novel mechanism by which new neurites or branch points along existing neurites may be generated in situ. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Jeff			Clinical utility of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for treating major depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Review						Transcranial direct current stimulation; tDCS; Major depression; Response; Remission; Meta-analysis; Systematic review	NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; DISORDER; CORTEX; SCALE; BIAS; TOOL	Objective: tDCS is a promising novel therapeutic intervention for major depression (MD). However, clinical trials to date have reported conflicting results concerning its efficacy, which likely resulted from low statistical power. Thus, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized, double-blind and controlled trials of tDCS in MD with a focus on clinically relevant outcomes, namely response and remission rates. Method: We searched the literature for English language randomized, double-blind and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) on tDCS for treating MD from 1998 through July 2012 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and SCOPUS. We also consulted the Web of Science's Citations Index Expanded for the selected RCTs up to July 2012. The main outcome measures were response and remission rates. We used a random-effects model and Odds Ratios (OR). Results: Data were obtained from 6 RCTs that included a total of 200 subjects with MD. After an average of 10.8 +/- 3.76 tDCS sessions, no significant difference was found between active and sham tDCS in terms of both response (23.3% [24/103] vs. 12.4% [12/97], respectively; OR = 1.97; 95% CI = 0.85-4.57; p = 0.11) and remission (12.2% [12/98] vs. 5.4% [5/92], respectively; OR = 2.13; 95% CI = 0.64-7.06; p = 0.22). Also, no differences between mean baseline depression scores and dropout rates in the active and sham tDCS groups were found. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs that involved less than 10 treatment sessions or stimulus intensity of less than 2 mA did not alter the findings. However, tDCS used as monotherapy was associated with higher response rates when compared to sham tDCS (p = 0.043). Finally, the risk of publication bias in this meta-analysis was found to be low. Conclusions: The clinical utility of tDCS as a treatment for MD remains unclear when clinically relevant outcomes such as response and remission rates are considered. Future studies should include larger and more representative samples, investigate how tDCS compares to other therapeutic neuromodulation techniques, as well as identify optimal stimulation parameters. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In humans such influences include effects on phenotypes, such as stress reactivity, which determine individual differences in the vulnerability for affective disorders. Thus, the adult offspring of rat mothers that show an increased frequency of pup licking/grooming (ie, high LG mothers) show increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and more modest hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress compared with the offspring of low LG mothers. In humans, childhood maltreatment associates decreased hippocampal GR expression and increased stress responses in adulthood. We review the evidence suggesting that such effects are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation across GR promoter regions. We also present new findings revealing associated histone post-translational modifications of a critical GR promoter in rat hippocampus. Taken together these existing evidences are consistent with the idea that parental influences establish stable phenotypic variation in the offspring through effects on intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the epigenetic state and function of specific regions of the genome.

We use the French broadcast audio transcription task from ETAPE 2011 for this evaluation. We compare word error rate (WER) versus overall computing time for hidden Markov models with Gaussian mixtures (GMM-HMM) and deep neural networks (DNN-HMM). We show that for a similar computing during recognition, the DNN-HIVIM combination is superior to the GMM-HMM. For a realtime computing scenario, the error rate for the ETAPE dev set is 23.5% for DNN-HMM versus 27.9% for the GMM-HIVIM: a significant difference in accuracy for comparable computing. Rescoring lattices (generated by DNN-HMM acoustic model) with a quadgram language model (LM), and then with a neural net LM reduces the WER to 22.0% while still providing realtime computing.

In light of the recent success of applying deep neural network technologies in domain detection and intent identification, we carried out an in-depth investigation on the use of recurrent neural networks for the more difficult task of slot filling involving sequence discrimination. In this work, we implemented and compared several important recurrent-neural-network architectures, including the Elman-type and Jordan-type recurrent networks and their variants. To make the results easy to reproduce and compare, we implemented these networks on the common Theano neural network toolkit, and evaluated them on the ATIS benchmark. We also compared our results to a conditional random fields (CRF) baseline. Our results show that on this task, both types of recurrent networks outperform the CRF baseline substantially, and a bi-directional Jordan type network that takes into account both past and future dependencies among slots works best, outperforming a CRFbased baseline by 14% in relative error reduction.

A Review of Microelectrode Array Technologies: Design and Implementation Challenges	2013 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (ABME 2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advances in Biomedical Engineering (ABME)	SEP 11-13, 2013	Tripoli, LEBANON			Microelectrode arrays; Electrodes-Tissues Contacts; Microelectrode Impedance; Neural prosthesis		The emerging field of neuroprosthetics is focused on design and implementation of neural prostheses to restore some of the lost neural functions. Remarkable progress has been reported in the various brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) but the electrode-tissue contacts remain one of the major obstacles. The success of these BMIs relies on electrodes which are in contact with the neural tissue and act as an interface between tissue/sensors or tissue/bio-microelectromechanical systems (bio-MEMS). In recent years, Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs) fabrication techniques have been developed to have a long-term and stable interface with the brain. So far, none of these attempts have lead to a major breakthrough. In this paper, we review different microfabrication techniques of MEAs with their advantages and drawbacks. Then, we propose high-density, three-dimensional ( 3D), silicon-based MEAs using micromachining methods. The geometries that will be used include arrays of penetrating variable-height probes.
