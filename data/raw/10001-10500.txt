Heterogeneous intrastriatal pattern of proteins regulating axon growth in normal adult human brain	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Axon growth; PSA-NCAM; TUC-4; Doublecortin; Bcl-2; Glial fibrillary acidic protein; Human leukocyte antigen; Striatum; Aging	MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA NEURONS; MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; HUMAN NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; CELL-ADHESION MOLECULE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BCL-2 PROTEIN; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES	There is much controversy regarding the extent of axon regeneration/sprouting ability in adult human brain. However, intrinsic differences in axon/neurite growth capability amongst striatal (caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens) subdivisions could conceivably underlie, in part, their differential vulnerability in degenerative human brain disorders. To establish whether the distribution of axon growth markers in mature human striatum might be uniform or heterogeneous, we measured the intra-striatal pattern, in autopsied brain of normal subjects (n = 40, age 18-99), of proteins involved in regulating axon growth. These proteins included polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), microtubule-associated proteins TUC-4 (TOAD/Ulip/CRAMP-4) and doublecortin (DCX), and Bcl-2. The distribution of the marker proteins within the striatum was heterogeneous and inversely related to the pattern of dopamine loss previously characterized in Parkinson's disease (PD). with levels in nucleus accumbens>caudate>putamen, ventral>dorsal, and rostral putamen> caudal. In contrast, distribution of glial markers including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DR alpha and HLA-DR/DQ/DP beta), other Bcl-2 family proteins, and control proteins neuron-specific enolase and alpha-tubulin in the striatum was either homogeneous or had a pattern unmatched to dopamine loss in PD. The putamen also showed more marked age-dependent decreases in concentrations of PSA-NCAM, TUC-4, and DCX and increases in GFAP levels than caudate. We conclude that the intrastriatal pattern of several key axon growth proteins is heterogeneous in adult human brain. Further investigation will be required to establish whether this pattern, which was inversely correlated with the pattern of dopamine loss in PD, is involved to any extent in the pathophysiology of this degenerative disorder.

Clinical immunology of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator fingolimod (FTY720) in multiple sclerosis	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CD8(+) T-CELLS; ORAL FINGOLIMOD; IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT FTY720; MARGINAL ZONE; DOSE FTY720; PHASE-II; SPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATE; RESPONSES; THERAPY	The oral sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor (S1PR) modulator fingolimod has been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). The drug binds with high affinity to 4 of the 5 G-protein-coupled S1P receptors (S1P(1-5)). After binding, the receptors are internalized, degraded, and thus functionally antagonized by fingolimod. Under physiologic conditions, S1P(1) mediates the egress of lymphocytes from secondary lymphoid organs to the peripheral circulation. Functional antagonism of S1P(1) by fingolimod results in a reduction in peripheral lymphocyte counts by inhibiting egress of lymphocytes, including potentially encephalitogenic T cells and their naive progenitors that would otherwise be present within the circulation. Despite the fingolimod-mediated reduction of lymphocyte counts, fingolimod-treated patients with MS have been shown to have few infections and related complications and were able to mount antigen-specific immune responses in vaccination studies.

While much has been learnt regarding the sequential steps of leucocyte capture, adhesion and migration across the vasculature, the molecular basis of leucocyte extravasation is only just being unravelled. It is now recognized that bidirectional crosstalk between the immune cell and endothelium is an essential element in mediating diapedesis during both normal immune surveillance and under inflammatory conditions. The induction of various signalling networks, through engagement of cell surface molecules such as integrins on the leucocyte and immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell, play a major role in determining the pattern and route of leucocyte emigration. In this review we discuss the extent of our knowledge regarding leucocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier and in particular the endothelial cell signalling pathways contributing to this process.

We completed a retrospective analysis of 120 term infants who experienced clinical neonatal seizures at a single academic pediatric neurology practice. Logistic regression analysis determined the significant independent prognostic (P < 0.05) indicators of cerebral palsy, global developmental delay, and epilepsy. Fifty-four (45%) infants were never diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental abnormality, whereas 37 (31%) manifested cerebral palsy, 51 (43%) manifested global developmental delay, and 38 (32%) manifested epilepsy. Global developmental delay was present in 92% of the children who manifested spastic quadraparetic cerebral palsy. Seizure type, seizure onset, electroencephalographic background findings, and 5-minute Apgar scores constituted independent predictors of cerebral palsy. None of the children who manifested less than two predictors developed the disorder. For global developmental delay, predictors included method of delivery, seizure onset, electroencephalographic background findings, and etiology. Only one infant (2%) who manifested less than two predictors exhibited global developmental delay. For epilepsy, predictors included seizure type and administration of a second antiepileptic drug. Only one infant (3%) who manifested neither predictor developed the disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

NIH Consensus Development Conference Statement: Inhaled Nitric-Oxide Therapy for Premature Infants	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						premature; inhaled nitric-oxide therapy; bronchopulmonary dysplasia		Premature birth is a major public health problem in the United States and internationally. Infants born at or before 32 weeks' gestation (2% of all births in the United States in 2007) are at extremely high risk for death in the neonatal period or for pulmonary, visual, and neurodevelopmental morbidities with lifelong consequences including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and brain injury. Risks for adverse outcomes increase with decreasing gestational age. The economic costs to care for these infants are also substantial (estimated at $26 billion in 2005 in the United States). It is clear that the need for strategies to improve outcomes for this high-risk population is great, and this need has prompted testing of new therapies with the potential to decrease pulmonary and other complications of prematurity. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) emerged as one such therapy. To provide health care professionals, families, and the general public with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding the benefits and risks of iNO in premature infants, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of Health convened a consensus-development conference. Findings from a substantial body of experimental work in developing animals and other model systems suggest that nitric oxide may enhance lung growth and reduce lung inflammation independently of its effects on blood vessel resistance. Although this work demonstrates biological plausibility and the results of randomized controlled trials in term and near-term infants were positive, combined evidence from the 14 randomized controlled trials of iNO treatment in premature infants of <= 34 weeks' gestation shows equivocal effects on pulmonary outcomes, survival, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Methods-In this randomized, controlled, blinded pilot study, the effect of 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over right-hemispheric Broca homolog in subjects with poststroke aphasia in the subacute stage was examined. According to their group allocation, patients received, in addition to conventional speech and language therapy, multiple sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation either over the right-hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus (intervention group) or over the vertex (control group). The primary outcome parameter was the change in laterality indices as quantified by activation positron emission tomography before and after the 2-week intervention period. The clinical efficacy was evaluated with the Aachen Aphasia Test. Results-At baseline, no group differences were discovered for age, laterality indices, or mean Aachen Aphasia Test scores. Four patients were lost to follow-up, but none due to side effects of the transcranial magnetic stimulation. Positron emission tomography revealed an activation shift toward the right hemisphere in the control group (P=0.0165), which was absent in the intervention group. Furthermore, the latter improved significantly clinically by a mean of 19.8 points in the Aachen Aphasia Test total score (P=0.002), whereas the control group did not. There was however no clear linear relationship between the extent of laterality shift and clinical improvement (r=0.193, P=nonsignificant). Conclusions-Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation might be an effective, safe, and feasible complementary therapy for poststroke aphasia. (Stroke. 2011; 42: 409-415.)

The development of different radioligands for the translocator protein, a mitochondrial membrane protein expressed in microglial cells when they transform from the resting to the activated state, allows to study the temporal dynamics of this cellular neuroinflammatory component in vivo in animal models and human stroke using positron emission tomography. In this article, we review the advantage and limitations of current and future methods for microglia imaging as well as new results of multimodal imaging approaches in clinical stroke, which try to combine microglia imaging with diffusion tensor imaging to investigate the clinical relevance of remote microglia activation along fiber tracts for poststroke recovery.

Here, we show that L-PGDS and arrestin-3 (Arr3) interact directly and can be co-immunoprecipitated endogenously from MG-63 osteoblasts. Perinuclear L-PGDS/Arr3 co-localization is observed in PGD(2)-producing MG-63 cells and is induced by the addition of the L-PGDS substrate or co-expression of COX-2 in HEK293 cells. Inhibition of L-PGDS activity in MG-63 cells triggers redistribution of Arr3 and L-PGDS to the cytoplasm. Perinuclear localization of L-PGDS is detected in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) but is more diffused in MEFs-arr-2(-/-) -arr-3(-/-). Arrestin-3 promotes PGD(2) production by L-PGDS in vitro. IL-1 beta-induced PGD(2) production is significantly lower in MEFs-arr-2(-/-) -arr-3(-/-) than in wild-type MEFs but can be rescued by expressing Arr2 or Arr3. A peptide corresponding to amino acids 86-100 of arrestin-3 derived from its L-PGDS binding domain stimulates L-PGDS-mediated PGD(2) production in vitro and in MG-63 cells. We report the first characterization of an interactor/modulator of a PGD(2) synthase and the identification of a new function for arrestin, which may open new opportunities for improving therapies for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

The presence of eCBs, their CB1 receptor (CB1R), and metabolizing enzymes at embryonic and early postnatal periods have been linked to developmental processes such as neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and migration, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a functional eCB system in the developing visual system and the role of CB1R during axon growth and retinothalamic development. Pharmacological treatment of retinal explants and primary cortical neuron cultures with ACEA, a selective CB1R agonist, induced a collapse of the growth cone (GC). Furthermore the application of AM251, a CB1R inverse agonist, to the neuronal cultures increased the surface area of GC. In vivo, intraocular injection of ACEA diminished retinal projection growth, while AM251 promoted growth and caused aberrant projections. In addition, compared with their wild-type littermates, CB1R-deficient adult mice revealed a lower level of eye-specific segregation of retinal projections in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Finally, we found that pharmacological modulation of CB1R affected the trafficking of Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) receptor to the plasma membrane in a PKA-dependent manner. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of DCC abolished the CB1R-induced reorganization of the GC. Overall, these findings establish a mechanism by which the CB1R influences GC behavior and nervous system development in concerted action with DCC.

AGING OF THE SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE NEURAL STEM CELL NICHE: EVIDENCE FOR QUIESCENCE-ASSOCIATED CHANGES BETWEEN EARLY AND MID-ADULTHOOD	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						stem cells; neurogenesis; quiescence; subventricular zone; neurospheres; aging	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MAMMALIAN BRAIN; PROGENITOR CELLS; EPENDYMAL CELLS; OLFACTORY-BULB; SUBEPENDYMAL CELLS; NEUROGENIC REGIONS; LIPID DROPLETS; VASCULAR NICHE; FOREBRAIN	Stem cells can exist in either active or quiescent states. In the aging hippocampus, adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) shift into a quiescent state, contributing to age-related reductions in hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we focused on the subventricular zone (SVZ) stem cell niche of the adult forebrain, asking to what extent quiescence-associated changes in aNSCs are initiated between early and middle-age. Immunohistochemical and label retention experiments revealed that the overall output of the SVZ stem cell system was already highly decreased in middle-aged mice (12-months-old) compared with young adult mice (2-month-old), as measured by reduced marker expression for multiple neural precursor sub-populations and diminished addition of SVZ-derived neuroblasts to the olfactory bulbs (OBs). These changes were associated with significant cytological aberrations within the SVZ niche, including an overall atrophy of the SVZ and accumulation of large lipid droplets within ependymal cells, which are key support cells of the SVZ niche. Importantly, the reduced output of the middle-aged SVZ stem cell system correlated with quiescence-associated changes in middle-aged aNSCs. Specifically, while tissue culture experiments showed that young adult and middle-aged fore-brains possessed equal numbers of neurosphere-forming aNSCs, the middle-aged neurospheres exhibited differences in their in vitro properties, and middle-aged aNSCs in vivo divided less frequently. These findings demonstrate that aNSCs begin undergoing quiescence-associated changes between early and mid-adulthood in the mouse SVZ, and serve as a useful framework for further studies aimed at defining the early events involved in aging-associated quiescence of aNSCs.

Translation of 5 ' terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5 ' TOP) mRNAs in Aplysia Californica is regulated by the target of rapamycin (TOR)	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Polysomes; 5 ' terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5 ' TOP); mRNAs; Aplysia; Serotonin; Memory; Translational control	LOCAL PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; S6 KINASE; RPS6 PHOSPHORYLATION; SENSITIVE MANNER; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; FACILITATION; SEROTONIN; PATHWAY; CELLS; POTENTIATION	Aplysia californica is a model organism for determining the molecular basis of memory. In this system identified synaptic changes have been closely linked to behavioral memories. Long-term sensitization and long-term synaptic changes between sensory neurons and motor neurons require both gene expression followed by translational control of the newly expressed mRNAs. One important mechanism for translational control is mediated through the target of rapamycin (TOR) and one mechanism downstream of TOR is the translational control of mRNAs containing a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5'TOP) sequence in their mRNA transcript. These include all ribosomal proteins, elongation factors and a few other translational regulators. TOR regulation of 5'TOP mRNAs in vertebrates is thought to be due to TOR dependent removal of the translational repression mediated by the 5'TOP sequence. Here, we show that this mechanism is similar in Aplysia, whereby Aplysia 5'TOP mRNAs are repressed under basal conditions and this repression is removed by serotonin in a rapamycin-sensitive manner.

J	Gisiger, T; Boukadoum, M				Gisiger, Thomas; Boukadoum, Mounir			Mechanisms gating the flow of information in the cortex: what they might look like and what their uses may be	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						gating; bistable neurons; up and down states; cortex; thalamus; basal ganglia; information flow; neural circuits	MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; IN-VIVO; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; FIRING PATTERNS; VISUAL-SYSTEM; PROJECTIONS	The notion of gating as a mechanism capable of controlling the flow of information from one set of neurons to another, has been studied in many regions of the central nervous system. In the nucleus accumbens, where evidence is especially clear, gating seems to rely on the action of bistable neurons, i.e., of neurons that oscillate between a quiescent "down" state and a firing "up" state, and that act as AND-gates relative to their entries. Independently from these observations, a growing body of evidence now indicates that bistable neurons are also quite abundant in the cortex, although their exact functions in the dynamics of the brain remain to be determined. Here, we propose that at least some of these bistable cortical neurons are part of circuits devoted to gating information flow within the cortex. We also suggest that currently available structural, electrophysiological, and imaging data support the existence of at least three different types of gating architectures. The first architecture involves gating directly by the cortex itself. The second architecture features circuits spanning the cortex and the thalamus. The third architecture extends itself through the cortex, the basal ganglia, and the thalamus. These propositions highlight the variety of mechanisms that could regulate the passage of action potentials between cortical neurons sets. They also suggest that gating mechanisms require larger-scale neural circuitry to control the state of the gates themselves, in order to fit in the overall wiring of the brain and complement its dynamics.

AV45-A07 Study Grp	Use of Florbetapir-PET for Imaging beta-Amyloid Pathology	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; PRECLINICAL ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN; DIAGNOSIS; DECLINE; NEUROPATHOLOGY; INDIVIDUALS; RADIOLIGAND; PREDICTION	Context The ability to identify and quantify brain beta-amyloid could increase the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Objective To determine if florbetapir F 18 positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging performed during life accurately predicts the presence of beta-amyloid in the brain at autopsy. Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective clinical evaluation conducted February 2009 through March 2010 of florbetapir-PET imaging performed on 35 patients from hospice, long-term care, and community health care facilities near the end of their lives (6 patients to establish the protocol and 29 to validate) compared with immunohistochemistry and silver stain measures of brain beta-amyloid after their death used as the reference standard. PET images were also obtained in 74 young individuals (18-50 years) presumed free of brain amyloid to better understand the frequency of a false-positive interpretation of a florbetapir-PET image. Main Outcome Measures Correlation of florbetapir-PET image interpretation (based on the median of 3 nuclear medicine physicians' ratings) and semiautomated quantification of cortical retention with postmortem beta-amyloid burden, neuritic amyloid plaque density, and neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in the first 35 participants autopsied (out of 152 individuals enrolled in the PET pathological correlation study). Results Florbetapir-PET imaging was performed a mean of 99 days (range, 1-377 days) before death for the 29 individuals in the primary analysis cohort. Fifteen of the 29 individuals (51.7%) met pathological criteria for Alzheimer disease. Both visual interpretation of the florbetapir-PET images and mean quantitative estimates of cortical uptake were correlated with presence and quantity of beta-amyloid pathology at autopsy as measured by immunohistochemistry (Bonferroni rho, 0.78 [95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.89]; P<.001]) and silver stain neuritic plaque score (Bonferroni rho, 0.71 [95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.86]; P<.001). Florbetapir-PET images and postmortem results rated as positive or negative for beta-amyloid agreed in 96% of the 29 individuals in the primary analysis cohort. The florbetapir-PET image was rated as amyloid negative in the 74 younger individuals in the nonautopsy cohort. Conclusions Florbetapir-PET imaging was correlated with the presence and density of beta-amyloid. These data provide evidence that a molecular imaging procedure can identify beta-amyloid pathology in the brains of individuals during life. Additional studies are required to understand the appropriate use of florbetapir-PET imaging in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and for the prediction of progression to dementia.

It has been challenging to ascertain whether this variability reflects distinct but reproducible lineages among many different retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) or is the product of stochastic fate decisions operating within a population of more equivalent RPCs. To begin to distinguish these possibilities, we developed a method for long-term videomicroscopy to follow the lineages of rat perinatal RPCs cultured at clonal density. In such cultures, cell-cell interactions between two different clones are eliminated and the extracellular environment is kept constant, allowing us to study the cell-intrinsic potential of a given RPC. Quantitative analysis of the reconstructed lineages showed that the mode of division of RPCs is strikingly consistent with a simple stochastic pattern of behavior in which the decision to multiply or differentiate is set by fixed probabilities. The variability seen in the composition and order of cell type genesis within clones is well described by assuming that each of the four different retinal cell types generated at this stage is chosen stochastically by differentiating neurons, with relative probabilities of each type set by their abundance in the mature retina. Although a few of the many possible combinations of cell types within clones occur at frequencies that are incompatible with a fully stochastic model, our results support the notion that stochasticity has a major role during retinal development and therefore possibly in other parts of the central nervous system.

Evidence of severe mitochondrial oxidative stress and a protective effect of low oxygen in mouse models of inherited photoreceptor degeneration	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							CONE CELL-DEATH; RETINAL DEGENERATION; RETINITIS-PIGMENTOSA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; IN-VIVO; LIFE-SPAN; SLOW RDS; APOPTOSIS; LIGHT; MICE	The role of oxidative stress within photoreceptors (PRs) in inherited photoreceptor degeneration (IPD) is unclear. We investigated this question using four IPD mouse models (Pde6b(rd1/rd1), Pde6b(atrd1/atrd1), Rho(-/-) and Prph2(rds/rds)) and compared the abundance of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activity of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), which is oxidative stress sensitive, as indirect measures of redox status, in the retinas of wild type and IPD mice. All four IPD mutants had significantly reduced retinal complex I activities (14-29% of wild type) and two showed reduced GSH, at a stage prior to the occurrence of significant cell death, whereas mitochondrial citrate synthase, which is oxidative stress insensitive, was unchanged. We orally administered the mitochondrially targeted anti oxidant MitoQ in order to reduce oxidative stress but without any improvement in retinal complex I activity, GSH or rates of PR degeneration. One possible source of oxidative stress in IPDs is oxygen toxicity in the outer retina due to reduced consumption by PR mitochondria. We therefore asked whether a reduction in the ambient O(2) concentration might improve PR survival in Pde6b(rd1/rd1) retinal explants either directly, by reducing reactive oxygen species formation, or indirectly by a neuroprotective mechanism. Pde6b(rd1/rd1) retinal explants cultured in 6% O(2) showed 31% less PR death than normoxic explants. We conclude that (i) mitochondrial oxidative stress is a significant early feature of IPDs; (ii) the ineffectiveness of MitoQ may indicate its inability to reduce some mediators of oxidative stress, such as hydrogen peroxide; and (iii) elucidation of the mechanisms by which hypoxia protects mutant PRs may identify novel neuroprotective pathways in the retina.

The optical fibers were tapered to a final diameter of approximately 10 mu m and were used to guide the excitation light deep into the tissue and to collect the fluorescence emanating from the intracellular milieu. This fiber was coupled to a double barrel ion-sensitive electrode forming a micro-optrode with a final diameter around 15 mu m. The method was successfully used to record the intracellular K+ evolution with the fluorescent indicator PBFI during three states: normal sleep-like patterns, paroxysmal seizures, and coma. While we could not disclose any phasic fluctuations of the intracellular K+ during normal sleep patterns, they were clearly present during seizures and coma. In the majority of cases (58%), paroxysmal discharges were associated with positive variations of the intracellular fluorescence of 62 +/- 5% corresponding to extracellular K+ increases of 2.04 +/- 0.4 mM. In the remaining cases (42%) intracellular K+ dropped by 44.4 +/- 12% for an extracellular K+ increase of 2.62 +/- 0.47 mM. We suggest that this differential behavior might reflect different cellular populations (glia vs. neurons, respectively). Comatose states were accompanied by an extracellular drop of K+ of 1.31 +/- 0.13 mM, which was reflected, in all cases, by an intracellular K+ increase of 39 +/- 4%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, template-warping methods incorporating a label fusion strategy have demonstrated high accuracy in segmenting cerebral structures. In this study, we propose a novel patch-based method using expert manual segmentations as priors to achieve this task. Inspired by recent work in image denoising, the proposed nonlocal patch-based label fusion produces accurate and robust segmentation. Validation with two different datasets is presented. In our experiments, the hippocampi of 80 healthy subjects and the lateral ventricles of 80 patients with Alzheimer's disease were segmented. The influence on segmentation accuracy of different parameters such as patch size and number of training subjects was also studied. A comparison with an appearance-based method and a template-based method was also carried out. The highest median kappa index values obtained with the proposed method were 0.884 for hippocampus segmentation and 0.959 for lateral ventricle segmentation.

Elimination of visually evoked BOLD responses during carbogen inhalation: Implications for calibrated MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Calibrated MRI; Carbogen; Hypercapnia; Hyperoxia; Oxygen metabolism; Venous saturation	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; OXYGEN EXTRACTION FRACTION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TRANSIT-TIME; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; BRAIN ACTIVATION; FMRI; HYPERCAPNIA	Breathing a mixture of 10% CO2 with 90% O-2 (referred to here as carbogen-10) increases blood flow due to the vasodilatory effect of CO2, and raises blood O-2 saturation due to the enriched oxygen level. These effects both tend to reduce the level of deoxygenated hemoglobin in brain tissues, thereby reducing the potential for further increases in BOLD contrast. In the present study, blocks of intense visual stimulation (60 s) were presented amid longer blocks (180 s) during which subjects breathed various fractional concentrations (0-100%) of carbogen-10 diluted with medical air. When breathing undiluted carbogen-10, the BOLD response to visual stimulation was reduced below the level of noise against the background of the carbogen-10 response. At these concentrations, the total (visual + carbogen) BOLD response amplitude (7.5 +/- 1.0%, n = 6) converged toward that seen with carbogen alone (7.5 +/- 1.0%, n = 6). In spite of the almost complete elimination of the visual BOLD response, pseudo-continuous arterial spin-labeling on a separate cohort indicated a largely preserved perfusion response (89 +/- 34%, n = 5) to the visual stimulus during inhalation of carbogen-10. The previously discussed observations suggest that venous saturation can be driven to very high levels during carbogen inhalation, a finding which has significant implications for calibrated MRI techniques. The latter methods involve estimation of the relative change in venous O-2 saturation by expressing activation-induced BOLD signal increases as a fraction of the maximal BOLD signal M that would be observed as venous saturation approaches 100%. While the value of M has generally been extrapolated from much smaller BOLD responses induced using hypercapnia or hyperoxia, our results suggest that these effects could be combined through carbogen inhalation to obtain estimates of M based on larger BOLD increases. Using a hybrid BOLD calibration model taking into account changes in both blood flow and arterial oxygenation, we estimated that inhalation of carbogen-10 led to an average venous saturation of 91%, allowing us to compute an estimated M value of 9.5%.

Hypercapnia (HC) has been traditionally implemented through alterations in the fixed inspired fractional concentrations of carbon dioxide (F1CO2) without otherwise controlling end-tidal partial pressures of carbon dioxide (PETCO2) or oxygen (PETO2). There are several shortcomings to the use of this manual HC method that may be improved by using precise targeting of PETCO2 while maintaining iso-oxia. Similarly, precise control of blood gases can be used to induce isocapnic hyperoxia (HO) to reduce venous deoxyhaemoglobin (dHb) and thus increase BOLD signals, without appreciably altering CMRO2 or CBF. The aim of our study was to use precise end-tidal targeting to compare the calibration of BOLD signals under an isocapnic hyperoxic protocol (HOP) (rises in PETO2 to 140, 240 and 340 mm Hg from baseline) to that of an iso-oxic hypercapnic protocol (HCP) (rises in PETCO2 of 3, 5, 7 and 9 mm Hg from baseline). Nine healthy volunteers were imaged at 3 T while monitoring end-tidal gas concentrations and simultaneously measuring BOLD and CBF signals, via arterial spin labeling (ASL), during graded HCP and HOP, alternating with normocapnic states in a blocked experimental design. The variability of the calibration constant obtained under HOP (M-HOP) was 0.3-0.5 that of the HCP one (M-HCP). In addition, M-variances with precise gas targeting (M-HCP and M-HOP) were less than those reported in studies using traditional F1CO2 and F1O2 methods (M-HC and M-HO, respectively). We conclude that precise controlled gas delivery markedly improves BOLD-calibration for fMRI studies of oxygen metabolism with both the HCP and the more precise HOP-alternative.

In this study, 117 AD patients, 122 MCI patients and 112 control subjects (from the AddNeuroMed study) were included. High-resolution sagittal 3D MP-RAGE datasets were acquired from each subject. Automated regional segmentation and manual outlining of the hippocampus were performed for each image. Altogether this yielded volumes of 24 different anatomically defined structures which were used for OPLS analysis. 17 randomly selected AD patients, 12 randomly selected control subjects and the 22 MCI subjects who converted to AD at 1-year follow up were excluded from the initial OPLS analysis to provide a small external test set for model validation. Comparing AD with controls we found a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 90% using hippocampal measures alone. Combining both global and regional measures resulted in a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 94%. This increase in sensitivity and specificity resulted in an increase of the positive likelihood ratio from 9 to 15. From the external test set, the model predicted 82% of the AD patients and 83% of the control subjects correctly. Finally, 73% of the MCI subjects which converted to AD at 1 year follow-up were shown to resemble AD patients more closely than controls. This method shows potential for distinguishing between different patient groups. Combining the different MRI measures together resulted in a significantly better classification than using them separately. OPLS also shows potential for predicting conversion from MCI to AD.

After equating task structure between spatial versus temporal context tasks, subjects reported using similar strategies across tasks and we observed no significant differences in accuracy and reaction time performance between tasks. We used three methods of statistical analysis to interrogate similarities and differences in whole-brain activity across retrieval tasks, while focussing on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activations: multivariate partial least squares analysis (PLS), univariate statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and conjunction analysis. The PLS and conjunction analyses indicated that the overall pattern of PFC activity was similar across both temporal and spatial context retrieval tasks; but the SPM results indicated that some of these PFC regions exhibited differences in the degree to which they were engaged between tasks. However, none of these methods identified unique PFC activations specific to mediating spatial and/or temporal context retrieval. These results indicate that, overall, similar patterns of PFC activity were observed during temporal and spatial context memory retrieval once task structure and performance were equated.

Behavioral Signs of Chronic Back Pain in the SPARC-Null Mouse	SPINE			English	Article						back pain; animal model; osteonectin; degenerative disc disease; BM-40; matricellular	DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; LUMBAR INTERVERTEBRAL DISC; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; RODENT MODEL; DEGENERATION; MICE; RAT; NERVE; HYPERSENSITIVITY; RADICULOPATHY	Study Design. Secreted Protein, Acidic, and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC)-null mice were examined for behavioral signs of chronic low back and/or radicular pain. Objective. To assess SPARC-null mice as an animal model of chronic low back and/or radicular pain caused by degenerative disc disease. Summary of Background Data. Degeneration of intervertebral discs is a major cause of chronic low back and adicular pain in humans. Inactivation of the SPARC gene in mice results in premature intervertebral disc degeneration. The effect of disc degeneration on behavioral measures of chronic pain has not been evaluated in this model. Methods. Cohorts of young and old (3 and 6-12 months, respectively) SPARC-null and wild-type control mice were screened for behavioral indices of low back and/or radiating pain. Sensitivity to mechanical, cold and heat stimuli, locomotor impairment, and movement-evoked hypersensitivity were determined. Animals were challenged with 3 analgesic agents with different mechanisms: morphine, dexamethasone, and gabapentin. Results. SPARC-null mice showed signs of movement-evoked discomfort as early as 3 months of age. Hypersensitivity to cold stimuli on both the lower back and hindpaws developed with increasing age. SPARC-null mice had normal sensitivity to tactile and heat stimuli, and locomotor skills were not impaired. The hypersensitivity to cold was reversed by morphine, but not by dexamethasone or gabapentin. Conclusion. SPARC-null mice display behavioral signs consistent with chronic low back and radicular pain that we attribute to intervertebral disc degeneration. We hypothesize that the SPARC-null mouse is useful as a model of chronic back pain due to degenerative disc disease.

We built a telemetry system to simultaneously record, in freely behaving animals, the activity of the DCMD and of motoneurons involved in jump execution. Cocontraction of antagonistic leg muscles, a required preparatory phase, was triggered after the DCMD firing rate crossed a threshold. Thereafter, the number of DCMD spikes predicted precisely motoneuron activity and jump occurrence. Additionally, the time of DCMD peak firing rate predicted that of jump. Ablation experiments suggest that the DCMD, together with a nearly identical ipsilateral descending neuron, is responsible for the timely execution of the escape. Thus, three distinct features that are multiplexed in a single neuron's sensory response to impending collision-firing rate threshold, peak firing time, and spike count-probably control three distinct motor aspects of escape behaviors.

NEURAL HETEROGENEITIES INFLUENCE ENVELOPE AND TEMPORAL CODING AT THE SENSORY PERIPHERY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electrolocation; electrocommunication; information theory; nonlinearity; neural code; weakly electric fish	WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; INTERSPIKE INTERVAL CORRELATIONS; P-TYPE ELECTRORECEPTORS; AFFERENT NERVE-FIBERS; ELECTROSENSORY SYSTEM; APTERONOTUS-ALBIFRONS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; AMPLITUDE MODULATIONS; COMMUNICATION SIGNALS; MOVING-OBJECTS	Peripheral sensory neurons respond to stimuli containing a wide range of spatio-temporal frequencies. We investigated electroreceptor neuron coding in the gymnoti-form wave-type weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. Previous studies used low to mid temporal frequencies (<256 Hz) and showed that electroreceptor neuron responses to sensory stimuli could be almost exclusively accounted for by linear models, thereby implying a rate code. We instead used temporal frequencies up to 425 Hz, which is in the upper behaviorally relevant range for this species. We show that electroreceptors can: (A) respond up to the highest frequencies tested and (B) display strong nonlinearities in their responses to such stimuli. These nonlinearities were manifested by the fact that the responses to repeated presentations of the same stimulus were coherent at temporal frequencies outside of those contained in the stimulus waveform. Specifically, these consisted of low frequencies corresponding to the time varying contrast or envelope of the stimulus as well as higher harmonics of the frequencies contained in the stimulus. Heterogeneities in the afferent population influenced nonlinear coding as afferents with the lowest baseline firing rates tended to display the strongest nonlinear responses. To understand the link between afferent heterogeneity and nonlinear responsiveness, we used a phenomenological mathematical model of electrosensory afferents. Varying a single parameter in the model was sufficient to account for the variability seen in our experimental data and yielded a prediction: nonlinear responses to the envelope and at higher harmonics are both due to afferents with lower baseline firing rates displaying greater degrees of rectification in their responses. This prediction was verified experimentally as we found that the coherence between the half-wave rectified stimulus and the response resembled the coherence between the responses to repeated presentations of the stimulus in our dataset. This result shows that rectification cannot only give rise to responses to low frequency envelopes but also at frequencies that are higher than those contained in the stimulus. The latter result implies that information is contained in the fine temporal structure of electroreceptor afferent spike trains. Our results show that heterogeneities in peripheral neuronal populations can have dramatic consequences on the nature of the neural code. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

REPETITIVE ADAPTATION INDUCES PLASTICITY OF SPATIAL FREQUENCY TUNING IN CAT PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						visual cortex; spatial frequency selectivity; adaptation; plasticity; vision	STRIATE CORTEX; RECEPTIVE FIELDS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; COMPLEX CELLS; SINGLE UNITS; IN-VIVO; ORIENTATION; EXPERIENCE; DISCRIMINATION; ORGANIZATION	Sensory neurons display transient changes in their response properties following prolonged exposure to an appropriate stimulus (adaptation). In adult cat primary visual cortex, spatial frequency-selective neurons shift their preferred spatial frequency (SF) after being adapted to a non-preferred SF. In anesthetized cats prepared for electrophysiological recordings in the visual cortex, we applied a non-preferred spatial frequency for two successive periods of adaptation (a recovery and interval of similar to 90 min separated both phases of adaptation) in order to determine if a first adaptation retained an influence on a second adaptation. The first application of a non-preferred SF shifted the tuning curve of the cell mainly in the direction of the imposed SF. The results showed that attractive shifts occurred more frequently (68%) than repulsive (12%) changes in cortical cells. The increase of responsivity was band-limited and occurred around the imposed SF, while flanked responses remained unmodified in all conditions. After a recovery period allowing neurons to restore their original SF tuning curves, we carried out a second adaptation which produced four major results: (1) a higher proportion of repulsive shifts (31%) compared to attractive shifts (49%), (2) an increase of the magnitude of the attractive shifts, (3) an additional enhancement of the evoked firing rate for the newly acquired SF, and (4) for the acquired SF the variability coefficient decreased following the second adaptation. The supplementary response changes suggest that neurons in area 17 keep a "memory" trace of the previous stimulus properties. It also highlights the dynamic nature of basic neuronal properties in adult cortex since repeated adaptations modified both the spatial frequency tuning selectivity and the response strength to the preferred spatial frequency. These enhanced neuronal responses suggest that the range of adaptation-induced plasticity available to the visual system is broader than anticipated. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A ROLE FOR EXTRACELLULAR SIGNAL-REGULATED KINASES 1 AND 2 IN THE MAINTENANCE OF PERSISTENT MECHANICAL HYPERALGESIA IN OVARIECTOMIZED MICE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mitogen activated protein kinase; estradiol; pain; spinal cord; p38	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; SPINAL ERK ACTIVATION; PRIMARY AFFERENT NEURONS; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-ALPHA; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; MAP KINASE; PAIN HYPERSENSITIVITY; DIFFERENTIAL ACTIVATION; PATHWAY CONTRIBUTES	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important signaling factors in many cellular processes including cell proliferation and survival during development and synaptic plasticity induced by acute nociception in the adult. There is extensive evidence for the involvement of members of the MAPK family, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERKs 112), in the development of acute inflammatory somatic and visceral pain, but their role in the maintenance of chronic pain states is unknown. We have previously shown that ovariectomy of adult mice (OVX) generates a persistent and estrogen-dependent abdominal hyperalgesic state that lasts for several months and is not related to a persistent nociceptive afferent input. Here we have used OVX mice to study a possible role of ERK 1/2 in the spinal processing of this form of chronic abdominal hyperalgesia. Eight weeks after OVX the mice showed a robust abdominal hyperalgesia and a significant increase in the activation of ERK1/2 in the lumbosacral spinal cord. This enhanced activation was not seen in control and sham-operated mice or in regions of the cord other than lumbosacral in OVX mice. Also, the increased activation of ERK 1/2 observed in OVX mice matched the time course of the hyperalgesic state as no activation was observed at week 1 after OVX when the hyperalgesic state had not yet developed. Administration of slow-release pellets containing 17 beta-estradiol at week 5 post OVX reversed both the development of the hyperalgesia and the enhanced activation of ERK 1/2, suggesting that this activation, like the hyperalgesic state, was estrogen-dependent. Intrathecal injections of the ERK 1/2 inhibitor U0126 successfully rescued the mice from the abdominal hyperalgesia for up to 24 h after the injection and also reversed the enhanced expression of ERK 1/2. Our study shows, for the first time, activation of ERK 1/2 in the spinal cord matching the time course of an estrogen-dependent chronic hyperalgesic state. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A metric-based analysis of the contribution of spike timing to contrast and motion direction coding by single neurons in macaque area MT	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Neuron; Area MT; Motion; Contrast; Spike train; Temporal coding	PRIMATE VISUAL-CORTEX; FREQUENCY-DEPENDENCE; SPACE ANALYSIS; MONKEY; INFORMATION; RESPONSES; STIMULUS; CELLS; DISCRIMINATION; PHASE	Spike timing is thought to contribute to the coding of motion direction information by neurons in macaque area MT. Here, we examined whether spike timing also contributes to the coding of stimulus contrast. We applied a metric-based approach to spike trains fired by MT neurons in response to stimuli that varied in contrast, or direction. We assessed the :performance of three metrics, D-spike and D-product (containing spike count and timing information), and the spike count metric D-count. We analyzed responses elicited during the first 200 msec of stimulus presentation from 205 neurons. For both contrast and direction, the large majority of neurons showed the highest mutual information using D-spike, followed by D-product, and D-count. This was corroborated by the performance of a theoretical observer model at discriminating contrast and direction using the three metrics. Our results demonstrate that spike timing can contribute to contrast coding in MT neurons, and support previous reports of its potential contribution to direction coding. Furthermore, they suggest that a combination of spike count with periodic and non-periodic spike timing information (contained in D-spike, but not in D-product, and D-count which are insensitive to spike counts and timing respectively) provides the largest coding advantage in spike trains fired by MT neurons during contrast and direction discrimination.

This study and our previous one of parietal cortex (Archambault et al., 2009) provide a picture on the evolution of motor intention and online control of movement in the parietofrontal system. In frontal cortex, significant relationships were found between neural activity and hand kinematics (position, speed, and movement direction). When a change of motor intention occurred, the activity typical of the movement to the first target smoothly evolved into that associated with the movement toward the second one, as observed during direct reaches. Under these conditions, parietal cells remained a more accurate predictor of hand trajectory than frontal ones. The time lags of neural activity with hand kinematics showed that motor, premotor, and parietal cortex were activated sequentially. After the first target's presentation and its change of location, the population activity signaled the change of motor plan before the hand moved to the initial target's position. This signaling occurred earlier in premotor than in motor and parietal cortex. Thus, premotor cortex encodes a higher-order command for the correction of motor intention, while parietal cortex seems responsible for estimating the kinematics of the motor periphery, an essential step to allow motor cortex to modify the hand trajectory. This indicates that the parietofrontal system can update an original and not-yet-accomplished motor plan during its execution.

Increased temporolimbic cortical folding complexity in temporal lobe epilepsy	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; HEALTHY CONTROLS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN-BRAIN; MICRODYSGENESIS; ABNORMALITIES; GYRIFICATION; SURFACE; THICKNESS; SEIZURES	Objective: Converging evidence suggests that abnormalities of brain development may play a role in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). As sulco-gyral patterns are thought to be a footprint of cortical development, we set out to quantitatively map folding complexity across the neocortex in TLE. Additionally, we tested whether there was a relationship between cortical complexity and features of hippocampal maldevelopment, commonly referred to as malrotation. Methods: To quantify folding complexity, we obtained whole-brain surface-based measures of absolute mean cortical curvature from MRI scans acquired in 43 drug-resistant patients with TLE with unilateral hippocampal atrophy, and 40 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. In patients, we correlated changes in cortical curvature with 3-dimensional measures of hippocampal positioning. Results: We found increased folding complexity in the temporolimbic cortices encompassing parahippocampal, temporopolar, insular, and fronto-opercular regions. Increased complexity was observed ipsilateral to the seizure focus in patients with left TLE (LTLE), whereas these changes were bilateral in patients with right TLE (RTLE). In both TLE groups, increased temporolimbic complexity was associated with increased hippocampal malrotation. We found tendencies for increased complexity in bilateral posterior temporal cortices in LTLE and contralateral parahippocampal cortices in RTLE to be predictive of unfavorable seizure outcome after surgery. Conclusion: The anatomic distribution of increased cortical complexity overlapping with limbic seizure networks in TLE and its association with hippocampal maldevelopment further imply that neurodevelopmental factors may play a role in the epileptogenic process of TLE.

J	Hazell, AS; Wang, DM				Hazell, Alan S.; Wang, Dongmei			Identification of complexin II in astrocytes: A possible regulator of glutamate release in these cells	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Vesicular release; SNARE; Cell culture; Excitotoxicity; Neurotransmitter; Exocytosis	CULTURED HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; SYNAPTIC VESICLE EXOCYTOSIS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE; SNARE COMPLEX; N-ACETYLCYSTEINE; DOWN-REGULATION; SYNAPSES; PROTEIN; FUSION	Complexins are a family of SNARE complex-binding proteins which regulate neurotransmitter release by playing a crucial role in triggering fast exocytosis at the synapse. Current evidence indicates astrocytes can release glutamate via a vesicular mechanism similar to that at nerve terminals and thereby modulate synaptic activity. In addition, components of the biochemical machinery associated with synaptic release have been identified in these cells. However, whether complexins are also present in astrocytes and may therefore participate in the vesicular release of glutamate is a key issue that is yet to be determined. In the present study we therefore examined if astrocytes express complexin I (Cpx I) and/or complexin II (Cpx II). Our results indicate these cells contain Cpx II but not Cpx I in primary culture. In addition, serum deprivation for 24 h led to a 2.6-fold increase in Cpx II, suggesting this protein is responsive to insults. These findings point to Cpx II being a likely key modulator of synaptic activity at the level of these glial cells. Given the considered involvement of complexins in neurologic and psychiatric illness, astrocytic Cpx II represents a potentially important therapeutic target for the future treatment of such maladies.

However, the accuracy of syndrome definitions used in surveillance has never been evaluated in community settings. This study's objective was to assess the accuracy of syndrome definitions based on diagnostic codes in physician claims for identifying 5 syndromes (fever, gastrointestinal, neurological, rash, and respiratory including influenza-like illness) in community clinics. Methods: We selected a random sample of 3,600 community-based primary care physicians who practiced in the fee-for-service system in the province of Quebec, Canada in 2005-2007. We randomly selected 10 visits per physician from their claims, stratifying on syndrome type and presence, diagnosis, and month. Double-blinded chart reviews were conducted by telephone with consenting physicians to obtain information on patient diagnoses for each sampled visit. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of physician claims were estimated by comparison to chart review. Results: 1,098 (30.5%) physicians completed the chart review. A chart entry on the date of the corresponding claim was found for 10,529 (95.9%) visits. The sensitivity of syndrome definitions based on diagnostic codes in physician claims was low, ranging from 0.11 (fever) to 0.44 (respiratory), the specificity was high, and the PPV was moderate to high, ranging from 0.59 (fever) to 0.85 (respiratory). We found that rarely used diagnostic codes had a higher probability of being false-positives, and that more commonly used diagnostic codes had a higher PPV. Conclusions: Future research should identify physician, patient, and encounter characteristics associated with the accuracy of diagnostic codes in physician claims. This would enable public health to improve syndromic surveillance, either by focusing on physician claims whose diagnostic code is more likely to be accurate, or by using all physician claims and weighing each according to the likelihood that its diagnostic code is accurate.

The quality of care for adults with epilepsy: an initial glimpse using the QUIET measure	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article							ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; MOOD DISORDERS; SPECIALIST PHYSICIANS; OLDER PATIENTS; BONE MASS; GENERALIST; HEALTH; ASSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE	Background: We examined the quality of adult epilepsy care using the Quality Indicators in Epilepsy Treatment (QUIET) measure, and variations in quality based on the source of epilepsy care. Methods: We identified 311 individuals with epilepsy diagnosis between 2004 and 2007 in a tertiary medical center in New England. We abstracted medical charts to identify the extent to which participants received quality indicator (QI) concordant care for individual QI's and the proportion of recommended care processes completed for different aspects of epilepsy care over a two year period. Finally, we compared the proportion of recommended care processes completed for those receiving care only in primary care, neurology clinics, or care shared between primary care and neurology providers. Results: The mean proportion of concordant care by indicator was 55.6 (standard deviation = 31.5). Of the 1985 possible care processes, 877 (44.2%) were performed; care specific to women had the lowest concordance (37% vs. 42% [first seizure evaluation], 44% [initial epilepsy treatment], 45% [chronic care]). Individuals receiving shared care had more aspects of QI concordant care performed than did those receiving neurology care for initial treatment (53% vs. 43%; X(2) = 9.0; p = 0.01) and chronic epilepsy care (55% vs. 42%; X(2) = 30.2; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Similar to most other chronic diseases, less than half of recommended care processes were performed. Further investigation is needed to understand whether a shared-care model enhances quality of care, and if so, how it leads to improvements in quality.

Lund, summarizes most of the work related to the neural control of mastication that he conducted with his collaborators throughout the years. From his early PhD work showing that mastication is centrally patterned to his latest work related to the interaction between pain and movement, Lund will have addressed many essential questions regarding the organization and functioning of the masticatory central pattern generator (CPG). His earliest studies examined how the CPG modulates reflexes and the excitability of primary afferents, interneurons, and motoneurons forming their circuitry. He then tackled the question of how the CPG itself was modulated by different types of sensory and cortical inputs. Another series of studies focused on the organization of the subpopulations of neurons forming the CPG, their intrinsic and network properties. Shortly before his untimely passing, he had turned his attention to the potential contribution of muscle spindle afferents to the patterning of mastication as well as to the development of chronic muscle pain.

This is based, among others, on the observation that after a complete spinalization, cats can walk with the hindlimbs on a treadmill. Does this spinal pattern generator (CPG) also participate in the recovery of locomotion after a partial spinal cord lesion (SCI)? After such SCI, functional reorganization can occur spontaneously along the whole neuraxis, namely the spinal cord circuitry below the lesion (CPG) and in supraspinal structures still partially connected to the spinal cord. This review focuses mainly on the capacity of the spinal and supraspinal structures to reorganize spontaneously after incomplete SCI in animals (rats and cats). BMI approaches to foster recovery of functions after various types of SCI should take into account these changes at the various levels of the CNS.

This chapter reviews the work that has been done concerning singing among nonmusicians, focusing on pitch accuracy, which is one of the most important aspects of singing. First, we look at the prevalence of poor pitch singing and examine what it means to be a poor singer. Next, we look at the possible causes of poor singing and examine the possible roles of perceptual deficits, sensorimotor translation deficits, motor control deficits, and feedback deficits. Whereas many previous studies have tried to explain poor singing by positing perceptual problems, we argue that the current evidence supports sensorimotor translation deficits and motor control deficits as the more likely causes. Finally, we examine the neural bases of singing and the possibility of a dual-pathway basis for pitch perception and production. Based on these studies, we suggest changes to improve the singing abilities of poor singers.

Much of our initial understanding of the neurological processes underlying learning-induced changes in the cortex stems from the early exploitation of this model. More recent studies have provided a rich and elaborate demonstration of the "rules" governing representational plasticity induced during the critical period (CP) and in the longer post-CP "adult" plasticity epoch. These studies have also contributed importantly to the application of these "rules" to the development of practical training tools designed to improve the functional capacities of the auditory, language, and reading capacities of both children with developmental impairments and adults with acquired impairments in the auditory/aural speed and related cognitive domains. Using age as a connecting thread, we review recent studies performed in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1) that have provided further insight into the role of sensory experience in the shaping auditory signal representations, and into their possible role in shaping the machinery that regulates "adult" plasticity in A1. With this background, the role of auditory training in the remediation of auditory processing impairments is briefly discussed.

Here, deafness and blindness are taken as two illustrative models. Mainly, two promising rehabilitative strategies based on opposing theoretical principles will be considered: sensory substitution and neuroprostheses. Sensory substitution makes use of the remaining intact senses to provide blind or deaf individuals with coded information of the lost sensory system. This technique thus benefits from added neural resources in the processing of the remaining senses resulting from cross modal plasticity, which is thought to be coupled with behavioral enhancements in the intact senses. On the other hand, neuroprostheses represent an invasive approach aimed at stimulating the deprived sensory system directly in order to restore, at least partially, its functioning. This technique therefore relies on the neuronal integrity of the brain areas normally dedicated to the deprived sense and is rather hindered by the compensatory reorganization observed in the deprived cortex. Here, we stress that our understanding of the neuroplastic changes that occur in sensory-deprived individuals may help guide the design and the implementation of such rehabilitative methods.

We summarize a wide range of studies showing that sensory loss may lead, depending of the affected sensory system, to functional changes in other, primarily not affected senses, which range from heightened to lowered abilities. In the first part, the effects of blindness on mainly audition and touch are described. The latest findings on brain reorganization in blindness are reported, with a particular emphasis on imaging studies illustrating how nonvisual inputs recruit the visually deafferented occipital cortex. The second part covers crossmodal processing in deafness, with a special focus on the effects of deafness on visual processing. In the last portion of this review, we present the effects that the loss of a chemical sense have on the sensitivity of the other chemical senses, that is, smell, taste, and trigeminal chemosensation. We outline how the convergence of the chemical senses to the same central processing areas may lead to the observed reduction in sensitivity of the primarily not affected senses. Altogether, the studies reviewed herein illustrate the fascinating plasticity of the brain when coping with sensory deprivation.

Roughly, one-third of the cortical surface in primates is involved in visual processes. The loss of vision, either at birth or later in life, must therefore have profound consequences on brain organization and on the way the world is perceived and acted upon. In this chapter, we formulate a number of critical questions. Do blind individuals indeed develop supra-normal capacities for the remaining senses in order to compensate for their loss of vision? Do brains from sighted and blind individuals differ, and how? How does the brain of someone who has never had any visual perception form an image of the external world? We discuss findings from animal research as well from recent psychophysical and functional brain imaging studies in sighted and blind individuals that shed some new light on the answers to these questions.

For example, following an ischemic lesion, such as occurs following a stroke, there is a cascade of molecular, genetic, physiological and anatomical events that allows the remaining structures in the brain to reorganize. Often, these events are associated with recovery, suggesting that they contribute to it. Indeed, the term plasticity in stroke research has had a positive connotation historically. But more recently, efforts have been made to differentiate beneficial from detrimental changes. These notions are timely now that neurorehabilitative research is developing novel treatments to modulate, increase, or inhibit plasticity in targeted brain regions. We will review basic principles of plasticity and some of the new and exciting approaches that are currently being investigated to shape plasticity following injury in the central nervous system.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential of revealing early signs of neuro-degeneration in the human brain and may thus aid in predicting and diagnosing AD. Surface-based cortical thickness measurements from T1w MRI have demonstrated high sensitivity to cortical gray matter changes. In this study we investigated the possibility for using patterns of cortical thickness measurements for predicting AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used a novel technique for identifying cortical regions potentially discriminative for separating subjects with MCI, which progress to AD, from subjects with MCI, which do not progress to AD. Cortical thickness measurements from these selected regions were used in a classifier for testing the ability to predict AD. The classification showed an overall accuracy of 72% for predicting AD conversion in MCI patients 12 months in advance, which is better than recently published results on similar data.	[Eskildsen, S.

The present review describes the current assessment tools used in the clinic, where different scales have been developed for monitoring levels of DID in patients. We also review laboratory tools used to assess the quantity and characteristics of DID. Finally, we review assessment methods currently in development for monitoring DID and voluntary mobility in the natural living environment of patients. Here, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these tools as it pertains to their efficacy in assessing the quantity of DID, its characteristics, as well as its impact on the quality of life of patients. Finally, we discuss ongoing challenges and research questions that may guide future development of assessment methods aimed at monitoring DID and its impact on daily lives of patients.

Our framework integrates multi-modal MRI analysis (T1w, SWI, TOF-MRA) to determine an optimal trajectory to DBS targets (subthalamic nuclei and globus pallidus interna) while avoiding critical brain structures for prevention of hemorrhages, loss of function and other complications. Results show that our method is well suited to aggregate many surgical constraints and allows the analysis of thousands of trajectories in less than 1/10th of the time for manual planning. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of computed trajectories resulted in the identification of potential new constraints, which are not addressed in the current literature, to better mimic the decision-making of the neurosurgeon during DBS planning.

In this paper, we present a method for computing the apparent intravoxel Fibre Population Dispersion (FPD), which conveys the manner in which distinct fibre populations are partitioned within the same voxel. We provide a statistical analysis, without any prior assumptions on the number or size of these fibre populations, using an analytical formulation of the diffusion signal autocorrelation function in the spherical harmonics basis. We also propose to extract features of the FPD obtained in the group of rotations, using several metrics based on unit quaternions. We show results on simulated data and on physical phantoms, that demonstrate the effectiveness of the FPD to reveal regions with crossing tracts, in contrast to the standard anisotropy measures.

We propose a surface-based framework to analyze independently volume and positioning. After extracting the spherical harmonics combined with point distribution models (SPHARM-PDM) from manual labels, we computed displacement vectors between individual surfaces and the template. Then, we computed surface-based Jacobian determinants (SJD) from these vectors to localize volume changes. To analyze positional variants, we constructed a mean meridian axis (MEMAX), inheriting the shape-constrained point correspondences of SPHARM, on which we compute local curvatures and position vectors. We validated our method on synthetic shapes, and a large database of healthy subjects and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Our comprehensive analysis showed that in patients atrophy and positional changes co-occurred at the level of the posterior hippocampus. Indeed, in this region, while SPHARM-PDM showed mirrored deformations, SJD detected atrophy, and shape analysis of MEMAX unveiled medial positioning due to bending.

To account for inter-subject variability, including shape variants, we used a multi-template library derived from a large database of controls and patients. SurfMulti outperformed state-of-the-art volume-based single- and multi-template approaches, with performances comparable to controls (Dice index: 86.1 vs. 87.5%). Furthermore, the sensitivity of SurfMulti to detect atrophy was similar to that of manual volumetry. Given that the presence of hippocampal atrophy in TLE predicts a favorable seizure outcome after surgery, the proposed automated algorithm assures to be a robust surrogate tool in the presurgical evaluation for the time-demanding manual procedure.

The first level consists of a conventional neural network and a look-up-table that is used to suggest the best zoning scheme for a given unknown character. The information provided by the first level drives the second level in the selection of the appropriate feature extraction method and the corresponding class-modular neural network. The experimental protocol has shown significant recognition rates for handwritten characters (from 80.82% to 88.13%).	[Hirabara, Luciane Y.; Aires, Simone B. K.; Freitas, Cinthia O.

Simultaneous Water Activation and Glucose Metabolic Rate Imaging with PET	2011 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC)/18th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors	OCT 23-29, 2011	Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc (IEEE NPSS)			POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; ERROR ANALYSIS; TRACER; BRAIN; FEASIBILITY; TUMOR; SCAN	Simultaneous imaging of [O-15]H2O activation measuring relative regional cerebral blood flow (rrCBF) and [F-18]FDG for glucose metabolism is of potential interest for presurgical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain tumours. A novel imaging strategy is proposed to be able to separate the [F-18] FDG and the multiple [O-15]H2O signals from a simultaneously acquired dynamic acquisition of the two PET tracers. The technique is based on the fact that the dynamics of the two tracers are very distinct. By adopting an appropriate bolus injection strategy and by defining tailored sets of basis functions that model either the FDG or water component it is possible to separate the FDG and water signal. The basis functions are defined as the convolution of estimated input functions (IPFs) with a set of decaying exponential functions, where the IPFs are estimated from the overall measured head curve. The estimated IPFs are not required to correspond to the arterial IPFs of the two components and the proposed method does not need an arterial blood input function, which greatly increases the practical feasibility of the method. Once the IPFs are estimated the voxel-level time activity curves (TACs) are modelled using the basis functions. The set of exponential functions used to define the FDG basis functions are predetermined and equal for all voxels while the set of exponential functions defining the water basis functions will be determined for each individual voxel. The technique can be applied post-reconstruction as a fitting routine using the MLEM algorithm, or, the model can be incorporated in a global 4D reconstruction strategy to further reduce the noise in the estimated components. In this work the technique is applied post-reconstruction. Simulation studies show that the [F-18] FDG and the multiple [O-15]H2O components can be separated, when using simultaneous imaging, by the proposed model. The resulting errors are similar to the errors obtained when the two tracers are imaged separately demonstrating the feasibility of the method.

Evaluation of Image Based Spatially Variant and Count Rate Dependant Point Spread Functions on the HRRT PET scanner	2011 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC)/18th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors	OCT 23-29, 2011	Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc (IEEE NPSS)				Spatial resolution is of high importance especially in preclinical and brain PET imaging and characterization of the scanner's resolution properties requires measuring its point spread function (PSF). In our previous work we measured the PSF in 2 PET/eT scanners using a printed point source array. Here we extend the work to accurately measure the spatial variation of the PSF on the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) and assess the impact of the scanner's depth of interaction (DOI) capability on the spatial resolution. Furthermore we characterize the dependency of the PSF to count rate. An array of 15x11 printed sources was scanned twice, initially on its own (10min scan) and subsequently with an extension line containing similar to 300MBq of carbon-11 at the scan starts (15 x 10min contiguous frames). Data were reconstructed with OP-OSEM and invariant PSF OP-OSEM. The PSF was found to be radially dependent in all directions but importantly radially symmetric and almost axially independent. The FWHM improves by similar to 1.3mm using the PSF-OP-OSEM but is still radially variable with almost 1 mm degradation within the boundaries within which the brain is typically located. When DOI was not taken into account, a degradation up to 0.7mm was seen in the radial FWHM. In terms of count rate dependency, a clear resolution deterioration was seen, for count rates above 5-10 kcps with such count rates observed during many clinical scans.

Assessment of Bootstrap Resampling Accuracy for PET Data	2011 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC)/18th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors	OCT 23-29, 2011	Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc (IEEE NPSS)				Bootstrap resampling has been successfully used in estimating statistical properties of PET images by generating a set of statistically equivalent datasets based on one or more original datasets. However, the bootstrap resampling is only valid when the original dataset well represents the underlying distribution. The purpose of this work is to assess the validity of nonparametric bootstrap resampling using a long acquisition of a planar brain phantom, ensuring a good representation of the underlying distribution of all possible events. The assessment is carried out in two stages corresponding to the two 'worlds': i) the real world-generation of K reference list-mode datasets with five statistical levels (0.01 %, 0.1 %, 1 %, 10% and 20% of the original dataset) using resampling with replacement of the statistically very rich original dataset playing the role of the population; and ii) the bootstrap world-generation of equivalent K bootstrap replicates using five resampled dataset from stage i) for each of the five statistical levels. The distributions from the two stages or worlds are then compared using the metric of Jensen-Shannon (J-S) divergence to quantify the similarity of the two distributions from stages i) and ii). In order to apply the J-S divergence two different histogramming methods are used: i) with constant and ii) adaptable binning. The bootstrap distributions are found to be constantly different to the real world distributions regardless of the data size and binning method. However when statistics are very low (for single voxels and 0.01 % datasets) the comparison fails as the distributions are limited by the non-negativity constraint.	[Markiewicz, P. J.; Angelis, G.

Direct 3D PET Image Reconstruction into MR Image Space	2011 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC)/18th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors	OCT 23-29, 2011	Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc (IEEE NPSS)			RESOLUTION RESEARCH TOMOGRAPH; EMISSION; BRAIN	A method which includes both the motion correction and image registration transformation parameters from PET image space to MR image space within the system matrix of the MLEM algorithm is presented. This approach can be of particular significance in the fields of neuroscience and psychiatry, whereby PET is used to investigate differences in activation patterns between groups of participants (such as healthy controls and patients). This requires all images to be registered in a common spatial atlas. Currently, image registration is performed post-reconstruction. This introduces interpolation effects in the final image and causes image resolution degradation. Furthermore, motion correction introduces a further level of interpolation and possible resolution degradation. To include the transformation parameters (both for motion correction and registration) within the iterative PET reconstruction framework (through iterative use of actual software packages routinely applied after reconstruction) should reduce these interpolation effects and thus improve image resolution. Furthermore, it opens the possibility of direct reconstruction of the PET data into standardized stereotaxic atlases, e.g. ICBM152. To validate the proposed method, this work investigates registration, using 2D and 3D simulations based on the HRRT scanner geometry, between different image spaces using rigid body transformation parameters calculated using the mutual information similarity criterion. The quality of reconstruction was assessed using bias-variance and mean absolute error analyses to quantify differences with current post-reconstruction registration methods. We demonstrate a reduction in bias and in mean absolute error in reconstructed mean ROI activity when using the proposed method.

Current surface-based methods for cortex matching and at-lasing, although quite accurate, can require long computation times. Here we propose an approach based on spectral correspondence, where spectra of graphs derived from the surface model meshes are matched. Cerebral cortex matching problems can thus benefit from the tremendous speed advantage of spectral methods, which are able to calculate a cortex matching in seconds rather than hours. Moreover, spectral methods are extended in order to use additional information that can improve matching. Additional information, such as sulcal depth, surface curvature, and cortical thickness can be represented in a flexible way into graph node weights (rather than only into graph edge weights) and as extra embedded coordinates. In control experiments, cortex matching becomes almost perfect when using additional information. With real data from 12 subjects, the results of 288 correspondence maps are 88% equivalent to (and strongly correlated with) the correspondences computed with FreeSurfer, a leading computational tool used for cerebral cortex matching. Our fast and flexible spectral correspondence method could open new possibilities for brain studies that involve different types of information and that were previously limited by the computational burden.

We previously identified a brain- and cell-specific oxidative stress-mediated mechanism for dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) biosynthesis present in rat, bovine, and human brain, independent of the cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17) enzyme activity found in the periphery. This alternative pathway is induced by pro-oxidant agents, such as Fe2+ and amyloid-beta peptide. Using brain tissue specimens from control and AD patients we subsequently provided evidence that DHEA is formed in the AD brain by the oxidative stress-mediated metabolism of an unidentified precursor, thus depleting the levels of the precursor present in the blood stream. Here, we tested for the presence of this DHEA precursor in human serum using a simple Fe2+-based reaction and determined the amounts of DHEA formed. A total of 86 subjects were included in this study: 19 male and 20 female AD patients; 18 male and 22 female age-matched controls; and 4 men and 3 women with mild cognitive impairment. Serum oxidation resulted in a dramatic increase of DHEA level in control patients, whereas only a moderate or no increase was observed in the AD patients. The DHEA variation after oxidation correlated with the patients' cognitive and mental status. These results suggest that the comparison of DHEA levels in patient serum before and after oxidation could provide a useful tool to diagnose AD.

Neurocognitive accounts of delusion have traditionally highlighted perceptual misrepresentation as the primary trigger in addition to other cognitive deficits that maintain the delusion. Here, a general neurocognitive model of delusional disorder (DSM-IV) is proposed, not so much based on perceptual or cognitive deficits after right hemisphere damage as on cognitive propensities, specifically excessive inferencing (especially jumping to conclusions) and excessive reference to the self, due to left hemisphere overactivity. Method. The functional imaging, topographic EEG, and experimental imaging literatures on delusional disorder are reviewed, and 37 previously published cases of postunilateral lesion delusion (DSM-IV type, grandeur, persecution, jealousy, erotomania, or somatic), are reviewed and analysed multivariately. Results. Functional imaging and EEG topography data were slightly more indicative of left hemisphere overactivity in delusional disorder. In addition, 73% of the postunilateral lesion cases (chi(2) = 7.8, p = .005) of delusional disorder (DSM-IV type) had a right hemisphere lesion, whereas only 27% had a left hemisphere lesion. Conclusion. Left hemisphere release appears to be a more primary cause of delusional disorder than right hemisphere impairment, the latter merely entailing loss of inhibition of delusional beliefs. We propose that most patients with DSM-IV diagnoses of delusional disorder could be afflicted by excessive left hemisphere activity, but further research is necessary.	[Braun, Claude M.

Psychotic patients are impaired on recall and recognition of studied items (true memory) and typically make more false recall (intrusions) and false recognition than controls, reflecting greater susceptibility to false memory. The functional mechanisms underlying these deficits are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine recollection and familiarity in true and false memory in psychotic adolescents without long-term exposure to medication and repeated hospitalisations. Methods. Seventeen adolescents with psychosis and 17 matched controls were tested on a DRM false memory paradigm combined with a remember (R)/know (K)/guess (G) procedure. Recall and recognition of targets (studied words), critical lures (associated words) and unrelated distractors were measured. Between-group comparisons were made using t-tests and mixed ANOVAs. Independent estimates for recollection and familiarity were also calculated. Results. True memory was impaired in patients. Similar rates of false memory for critical lures were found in both groups. False memory for unrelated distractors was increased in patients. Contrary to controls, who attributed more R and K responses to targets than lures, patients attributed similar proportions of R and K responses to targets and lures. Furthermore, patients attributed more K responses than controls to all distractors. Conclusions. These findings suggest a deficit in recollection- and familiarity-based memory in psychotic adolescents as well as reliance on preserved gist or meaning-based memory to support poor item-specific memory.

It seems that PrP has evolved (and survived) to perform a function that does not have a precedent amongst transmembrane cell-surface proteins, perhaps representing a new type of plasma membrane ecosystem. In a context where we await a clarifying insight to unify a panoply of PrPC data into logical molecular framework, the GPI-anchored N-glycosylated Doppel and Sho proteins are tantalizing in that they correspond roughly to the front and back halves of PrPC itself. These molecules may be simpler - and more "understandable" - entities that can be pursued in parallel to PrPC, and could open up the biology of mammalian prion proteins from fresh directions. Dpl has a profound role in successful gametogenesis that warrants close scrutiny and a case for deeper study can be made for Sho, a recently discovered CNS-expressed protein with many parallels to established facets of PrP biochemistry. In an aerial view of biomedical research, Sho and Dpl can be considered as adjacent islands in a prion protein archipelago. As such, the coming years of molecular exploration should be extremely interesting.

With the concept of "user-perception" at the core of this approach, it appears promising to explore the potentials of neuroscience in design-oriented research that allow for measuring physiological effects of people interfering with artifacts. In this paper, we discuss fields of application concerning both the design and evaluation of artifacts. However, we also argue that neuroscience, despite its value for design-oriented IS research, should complement rather than substitute traditional research approaches and that results require thorough interpretation. We report on a first study that triangulates quantitative and neuroscientific data in the area of enterprise resource planning systems and indicate directions for future research.

Despite the abundance of literature data, the large number of the controlling parameters has made it difficult to predict and model the mechanical properties by the conventional techniques. Another obstacle encountered when making such a prediction is the complex kinetics and interactions that exist among the many variables. The goal of this study was to develop Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multiple Regression models to predict the mechanical properties of A356 alloy from the processing variables. Several standard multi-layer ANN models were developed and trained using data from the literature and experimental results. A series of nonlinear regression models were also developed and the results were compared with the predictions made by the ANN models. Due to the complexity of A356's solidification behaviour, the nonlinear regression produced results that were not as accurate as those produced by the ANN model. Unlike the nonlinear regression analysis, ANN can simplify the modelling process by eliminating the need to define a function. The results indicate that ANN is a suitable modelling technique for predicting mechanical properties of castings based on the alloy chemistry and processing variables.

These interventions frequently have undetermined efficacy and uncertain safety profiles. In this article, we present a general background and case vignettes that highlight the use of hyperbaric oxygen chambers and stem cells in cerebral palsy, the leading cause of pediatric physical disability. We then review the current evidence about these interventions as exemplars of unproven therapies. Building on the background and cases, we explore and review two important questions related to unproven interventions: (1) How should clinicians respond to requests for innovative and alternative interventions?

We present a method of recording, a noise reduction circuit design, followed by implementation, and validation of the icEEG monitoring system. The later includes the recording module and a seizure onset detection algorithm. The icEEG recording module has 3 stages for amplification and noise reduction. Initially, the input neural signal is recorded through an amplifier that has a feedback noise reduction circuit. Further, noises are removed by high and low pass filters. The present version of the system includes 6 channels. Each one features high amplification gain 60 dB, low noise (1 mu Vrms), and a high common mode rejection ratio 80dB. The total power consumption of the whole recording module is 12 mW. The proposed device was validated using icEEG recordings from two patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The multichannel monitoring system suggested reasonable assumption about the epileptogenic zone.

As a consequence, white matter appears differently across the cortical lobes in MR images acquired during early postnatal development. At 1 year old specifically, the gray/white matter contrast of MR images in prefrontal and temporal lobes is limited and thus tissue segmentation results show commonly reduce accuracy in these lobes. In this novel work, we propose the use of spatial intensity growth maps (IGM) for T1 and T2 weighted image to compensate for local appearance inhomogeneity. The IGM captures expected intensity changes from 1 to 2 years of age, as appearance inhomogeneity is highly reduced by the age of 24 months. For that purpose, we employ MRI data from a large dataset of longitudinal (12 and 24 month old subjects) MR study of Autism. The IGM creation is based on automatically co-registered images at 12 months, corresponding registered 24 months images, and a final registration of all image to a prior average template. In template space, voxelwise correspondence is thus achieved and the IGM is computed as the coefficient of a voxelwise linear regression model between corresponding intensities at 1-year and 2-years. The proposed IGM shows low regression values of 1-10% in GM and CSF regions, as well as in WM regions at advanced stage of myelination at 1-year. However, in the prefrontal and temporal lobe we observed regression values of 20-25%, indicating that the IGM appropriately captures the expected large intensity change in these lobes due to myelination. The IGM is applied to cross-sectional MRI datasets of 1-year old subjects via registration, correction and tissue segmentation of the corrected dataset. We validated our approach in a small study of images with known, manual "ground truth" segmentations. We furthermore present an EM-like optimization of adapting existing non-optimal prior atlas probability maps to fit known expert rater segmentations.

While some traditional localization systems use the triangulation techniques for outdoor channels, fingerprint positioning techniques are mostly used in more complex indoor environments like mines. One of the techniques exploited in the quasi-curvilinear topology of underground mines is the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) based fingerprint positioning combined with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This article innovates a CIR-based positioning technique within a cooperative memory-assisted approach that exploits both the temporal (from different time instances) and spatial (from different space positions) diversities of the collected fingerprints. Introducing memory-type signatures in a cooperative localization technique within the spatial confinements of the tunnel-shaped narrow-vein mines significantly increases the accuracy, precision and robustness of the localization system. The cooperative memory-assisted technique is capable of localizing a transmitter with an accuracy of less than 25 cm 90% of the time.

Functional Connectivity during Surround Suppression in Macaque Area V4	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			STRIATE CORTEX; NEURONS; V1; MT	Surround suppression is a common feature of sensory neurons. For neurons of the visual cortex, it occurs when a visual stimulus extends beyond a neuron's classical receptive field, reducing the neuron's firing rate. While several studies have been attributing the suppression effect on horizontal, long-range lateral or feedback connections, the underlying circuitry for surround modulation remain unidentified. Since most of these models have been relying on single neuron recordings, the contribution of lateral connections can only be suggested from the surround field properties. A more straightforward approach would be to detect these connections and their dynamics using simultaneous recordings from multiple neurons in one or more visual areas. We have developed a method for estimating these connections and we analyzed data obtained from 100-electrode Utah arrays chronically implanted into area V4 of the macaque monkey. Using a method based on the nonlinear Volterra modeling approach, we computed estimates of the strength and statistical reliability of connections among neurons, including nonlinear interactions and excitatory and inhibitory connections. Our results thus far reveal a pattern of connectivity within V4 that conforms to the results of previous anatomical work: Excitatory connections are far more common than inhibitory connections (similar to 65%), stronger connections are found among neurons that are physically near one another, and connections are stronger among neurons with similar receptive field properties. However, this connectivity is capable of reorganizing on short time scales according to the stimulus: Stimuli that evoke strong suppression at the single-unit level introduce stronger inhibition among V4 neurons, identifying recurrent connectivity as the source of the suppression. Overall, these results provide insight into the dynamic nature of neuronal organization within V4 and its contribution to surround suppression.

In particular, if a person is affected by a disease or an injury, the gait may be modified. To help detecting such change, we propose a new method based on multiple depth cameras. The aim of this paper is to show the possibility to reconstruct the body 3D volume in real time during gait in order to detect a pathological problem related to this movement and eventually improve diagnosis. Preliminary results showed that the system is sensitive to gait change produced by a heel prosthesis (heel cup) inserted in one shoe of subjects walking on a treadmill. The system detected a difference between maximal forward and backward positions of lower limbs for this pathological walk, a difference that was negligible for normal walk. These promising results were obtained with only 3 low cost depth cameras; we therefore believe that such methodology opens a new and affordable way for 3D volumetric gait analysis.

These important achievements toward clarifying the mechanistic processes underlying AD are being translated into ongoing development of biomarkers and their use in clinical trials. AD biomarkers are biochemical and anatomical variables (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid, positron emission tomography, and structural MRI) that measure AD-related pathologic features (i.e. amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration) in vivo. Biomarkers are utilized as 'diagnostic biomarkers' and/or 'endpoint biomarkers' in symptomatic or disease-modifying clinical trials. Diagnostic biomarkers play an important role in population enrichment by refining selection criteria, stratifying populations, and increasing the statistical power of trials. Endpoint biomarkers may be used as outcome measures to monitor the rate of disease progression and detect treatment effects. AD biomarkers do not reach abnormal levels or peak simultaneously, but do so in a time-dependent order. The choice of biomarkers for a clinical trial must take into consideration the type of therapeutic intervention, the clinical stage of AD, and the time dependence of biomarker changes during disease progression. The combination of amyloid and neurodegeneration biomarkers is highly desirable since they capture different aspects of the disease. Clinical trials for every clinical stage of AD would benefit from quantification and standardization of biomarkers. However, this is still a work in progress.

These techniques often rely on tracing. Traces, however, can be considerably large and complex to process. In this paper, we present an innovative approach for trace analysis inspired by the way the human brain and perception systems operate. The idea is to mimic the psychological processes that have been developed over the years to explain how our perception system deals with huge volume of visual data. We show how similar mechanisms can be applied to the abstraction and simplification of large traces. Some preliminary results are also presented.

In this paper, we present a data-driven technique for automatically learning cortical folding patterns from MR brain images. A local image feature-based model is learned using machine learning techniques, to describe brain images as a collection of independent, co-occurring, distinct, localized image features which may not be present in all subjects. The choice of feature type (SIFT, KLT, Harris-affine) is explored with regards to identifying cortical folding patterns while also uncovering their group-related variability across subjects. The model is built on lateral volume renderings from the ICBM dataset, and applied to hemisphere classification in order to identify patterns of lateralization based on each feature type.

Several methods have been proposed to study the shape of these folds, e.g., by first segmenting them on the cortical surface or by analysis via a continuous deformation of a common template. A major disadvantage of these methods is that, while they can localize shape differences, they cannot easily identify the directions in which they occur. The type of deformation that causes a fold to change in length is quite different from that which causes it to change in width. Furthermore, these two deformations may have a completely different biological interpretation. In this article we propose a method to analyze such deformations using directional filters locally adapted to the geometry of the folding pattern. Motivated by the texture flow literature in computer vision we recover flow fields that maintain a fixed angle with the orientation of folds, over a significant spatial extent. We then trace the flow fields to determine which correspond to the shape changes that are the most salient. Using the OASIS database, we demonstrate that in addition to known regions of atrophy, our method can find subtle but statistically significant shape deformations.

By directly modeling the smallest scale interactions, we can use recent microscopic experimental observations to infer all the parameters of the model. Then, using techniques from probability theory, we compute asymptotic limits of the stochastic behavior of individual motor-cargo complexes, while also characterizing both equilibrium and nonequilibrium ensemble behavior. We use these results in order to investigate three important biological questions: (1) How homogeneous are axons at stochastic equilibrium? (2) How quickly can axons return to stochastic equilibrium after large local perturbations? (3) How is our understanding of delivery time to a depleted target region changed by taking the whole cell point of view?

Key enabling developments were novel algorithms for detecting Doppler shifts produced by moving scatterers and new scanning protocols tailored to increase sensitivity to small flow speeds. These progresses were pushed by the need for a non invasive imaging modality to monitor quantitative blood flow at a higher resolution and a greater depth than could be achieved by other means. The rationale for this work originates from new hypotheses regarding the role of blood regulation in neurodegenerative diseases and from current investigations of animal models of vascular degeneration. In this work we demonstrate the synthetic reconstruction of dynamic blood flow in mice over the course of a single cardiac cycle in an 800 mu m wide by similar to 3mm deep B-Frame slice with a lateral resolution of 10 mu m and a depth resolution of 7 mu m. Images were taken using a cranial window over the exposed parietal bone of mice skull. Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings were co registered with the OCT A lines at high temporal resolution. QRS peak detection was then used to locate the time value of each A-line in the cardiac cycle and to reconstruct a synthetic temporal frame over one cardiac cycle. Doppler speed in this cardiac cycle was used to measure temporal variations of flow inside arteries and of their area. Three dimensional volume scans yielded measurements of quantitative blood flow on the same arteries. Using these informations a measure of compliance could be established. Comparing measures between atherosclerotic (ATX) and wild type (WT) mice revealed higher blood flow in WT mice, suggested lower systemic compliance in the ATX group but higher compliance of cerebral vasculature on these mice. These results are consistent with expectations showing that OCT is a potential tool for in-vivo arterial compliance evaluation.

To date, PCR and RT-PCR have been widely used for detection of viruses. In the case of environmental air sampling, the ability to detect a broad range of viruses would constitute a significant advantage for preventing outbreaks of airborne-transmitted viral infections. Given that neuraminidase is found on some respiratory virus species of medical or agricultural importance, this enzyme could theoretically be used to detect several different airborne viruses in a single assay. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of neuraminidase activity as a marker for rapid detection of airborne viruses. We first validated the use of a low-pathogenic strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a model airborne virus. Our findings revealed that neuraminidase activity-based assays are almost as sensitive as RT-PCR assays currently used for detection of NDV. We also validated the utilization of a neuraminidase substrate specific to viral neuraminidase. Experiments conducted in a controlled chamber demonstrated that the neuraminidase activity is preserved after aerosolization, air sampling using impingement and handling. Finally, we tested our method with swine barn air samples. Our results demonstrate that neuraminidase activity-based assays are suitable for detection of viruses in air samples.

A matched comparison of binocular rivalry and depth perception with fMRI	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						binocular vision; functional imaging; visual cortex; depth; attention; 3D surface and shape perception; binocular rivalry; stereopsis	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; FREQUENCY-TUNED CHANNELS; HUMAN BRAIN; INTRAPARIETAL AREAS; PARIETAL CORTEX; 3D SHAPE; SURFACE ORIENTATION; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; PROCESSING REGIONS; RELATIVE DISPARITY	Psychophysical experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to simultaneously perceive binocular depth and rivalry in plaids (A. Buckthought & H. R. Wilson, 2007). Here, we used fMRI at 3T to image activity in the visual cortex while human subjects perceived depth and rivalry from plaids. Six subjects performed either a rivalry or depth task. The spatial frequencies of the near-vertical and diagonal components were, respectively: 2.5, 6.4 cpd; 6.4, 2.5 cpd; or 6.4, 6.4 cpd. The network of activated cortical areas was very similar for the depth compared to the rivalry task. Nevertheless, regions of superior and inferior parietal cortices (including intraparietal sulcus) were activated more during the depth than the rivalry task, independent of spatial frequency, whereas a bias toward rivalry was seen in a lateral occipital region, superior temporal sulcus, and retrosplenial and ventral temporal cortices. Several retinotopic areas in the visual cortex showed a preference for the task with the higher (V1, V2, V3) or lower spatial frequency component (MT+), regardless of the depth or rivalry condition. Our results indicate that depth and rivalry are processed in a similar network of cortical areas and are perceived simultaneously by coexisting in different spatial channels. These results place constraints on binocular vision models.

J	Chalk, C; Benstead, TJ; Keezer, M				Chalk, C.; Benstead, T. J.; Keezer, M.			Medical treatment for botulism	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							INFANT BOTULISM; IMMUNE GLOBULIN; GUANIDINE; ANTITOXIN; EXPERIENCE; MANAGEMENT	Background Botulism is an acute paralytic illness caused by a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Supportive care, including intensive care, is key but the role of other medical treatments is unclear. Objectives To assess the effects of medical treatments on mortality, duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, tube or parenteral feeding and risk of adverse events in botulism. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (10 January 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (10 January 2010 in The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 2010), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011). We reviewed bibliographies, and contacted authors and experts. Selectioncriteria We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials examining the medical treatment of any of the four major types of botulism (infant intestinal botulism, food-borne botulism, wound botulism and adult intestinal toxemia). Medical treatments included equine serum trivalent botulism antitoxin, human-derived botulinum immune globulin, plasma exchange, 3,4-diaminopyridine and guanidine. Data collection and analysis Two authors selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently onto data extraction forms. Our primary outcome was in-hospital death from any cause occurring within four weeks. Secondary outcomes were death occurring within 12 weeks, duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, tube or parenteral feeding and risk of adverse events. Main results A single randomized controlled trial met the inclusion criteria. This trial evaluated human-derived botulinum immune globulin for the treatment of infant botulism. This study included 59 treatment patients and 63 control patients. There were no deaths in either group making any treatment effect on mortality inestimable. There was a significant benefit in the treatment group on duration of hospitalization (mean difference (MD) 3.10 weeks, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68 to 4.52), mechanical ventilation (MD 2.60 weeks, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.06), and tube or parenteral feeding (MD 6.40 weeks, 95% CI 2.80 to 10.00) but not on risk of adverse events or complications (relative risk reduction 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.18; absolute risk reduction 0.06, 95% CI 0.22 to -0.11). Authors' conclusions There is good evidence supporting the use of human-derived botulinum immune globulin in infant intestinal botulism. A single randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant decreases in the duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and tube or parenteral feeding among treated patients. Our search did not reveal any evidence examining the use of other medical treatments including serum trivalent botulism antitoxin.

Pairwise issue modeling for negotiation counteroffer prediction using neural networks	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electronic negotiations; Opponent modeling; Counteroffer prediction; Pairwise analysis; Offer optimization; Neural networks	AUTOMATED NEGOTIATIONS; FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS; SUPPORT; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEMS	Electronic negotiation systems can incorporate computational models and algorithms in order to help negotiators achieve their objectives. An important opportunity in this respect is the development of a component, which can assess an expected reaction by a counterpart to a given trial offer before it is submitted. This work proposes a pairwise modeling approach that provides the possibility of developing flexible and generic models for counteroffer prediction when the negotiation cases are similar. The key feature is that each negotiated issue is predicted while paired with each of the other issues and the permutations of issue pairs across all negotiation offers are confounded together. This data fusion permits extractions of common relationships across all issues, resulting in a type of pattern fusion. Experiments with electronic negotiation data demonstrated that the model's predictive performance is equivalent to case-specific models while offering a high degree of flexibility and generality even when predicting to a new issue.

J	Singh, M; Chandra, A				Singh, Mukhtiar; Chandra, Ambrish			Application of Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System for Sensorless Control of PMSG-Based Wind Turbine With Nonlinear-Load-Compensation Capabilities	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Active-power filter; adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems; distributed generation; grid interconnection; permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG); power quality; renewable energy; sensorless control; wind energy	ENERGY-CONVERSION	The precise information of permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) rotor position and speed is essentially required to operate it on maximum power points. This paper presents an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for speed and position estimation of PMSG, where an ANFIS-based model reference adaptive system is continuously tuned with actual PMSG to neutralize the effect of parameter variations such as stator resistance, inductance, and torque constant. This ANFIS-tuned estimator is able to estimate the rotor position and speed accurately over a wide speed range with a great immunity against parameter variation. The proposed system consists of two back-to-back connected inverters, where one controls the PMSG, while another is used for grid synchronization. Moreover, in the proposed study, the grid-side inverter is also utilized as harmonic, reactive power, and unbalanced load compensator for a three-phase, four-wire (3P4W) nonlinear load, if any, at point of common coupling (PCC). This enables the grid to always supply/absorb a balanced set of fundamental currents at unity power factor. The proposed system is developed and simulated using MATLAB/SimPowerSystem (SPS) toolbox. Besides this, a scaled laboratory hardware prototype is developed and extensive experimental study is carried out to validate the proposed control approach.

This microsystem consists of a single ended low noise low power amplifier and an integrator, in addition to a 10-bit first order sigma delta Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). Using electrochemical techniques, it senses picoscale to microscale current which corresponds to micro molar neurotransmitter concentration and converts the measurement to a 10-bit digital code. Combining amperometry and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry electrochemical technique results in a sensor with a high selectivity while having elevated temporal resolution. The microsystem consumes 120.85 mu W which is the lowest reported brain implant and biosensor power consumption [1-5]. This circuit is designed in CMOS 0.18 mu m technology. Integration is an averaging operation and provides significant noise immunity. The low noise characteristics of our design make this device suitable for the noisy environment often encountered in-vivo.

The neural network structure belongs to the class of locally recurrent globally feed-forward networks. The architecture of the network is similar to the feed-forward multi-layer perceptron with the difference that the processing units include dynamic characteristics. The dynamic neural network is used for fault detection in a dual-spool turbo fan engine. A number of simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed neural network diagnosis methodology.

While simple thresholding locates spikes, using an adequate pre-processor before thresholding can improve the performances of detection. We present in this paper low-power implementations of three interesting energy-based preprocessors (Abs, TEO, and Smoothed-TEO). The proposed novel spike detection module allows a trade-off between silicon area and power consumption of the system. Performances have been evaluated with recorded neural signals from monkeys to determine the optimal trade-off. The post-routed power estimation showed that the implementation of the optimal detection pre-processor tested in this work, the Smoothed-TEO, achieves 961 nW per channel and occupies a silicon area of 0.008 mm(2) per channel.

The proposed design tunes the bandwidth of the signal acquisition Band-Pass Filter (BPF), which suffers from process variations corners. It also performs the adjustment of the Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) gain to maximize the input voltage range of the analog-to-digital conversion. The circuit, which consists on a frequency-controlled signal generator and a digital processor, operates in foreground, is completely autonomous and integrable in an estimated area of 0.026mm(2), with a power consumption around 450nW. The calibration procedure takes less than 250ms to select the configuration whose performance is closest to the required one.

In order to design the classification system, a three-stage approach is used. It consists of wavelet decomposition of the image under study, feature extraction from the LH and HL sub-bands using first order statistics, and final classification by support vector machines (SVM). The proposed approach shows higher performance than when using features extracted from the LL sub-band. It is concluded that the horizontal and vertical sub-bands of the wavelet transform can effectively encode the discriminating features of normal and pathological images.

The same speech recognizer (Hidden Markov Model -HMM- and Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients -MFCC-) has been used with the proposed VFR analysis and conventional fixed frame rate (FFR) approach. In comparison with other VFR recognizers, the hierarchical features in the proposed system have the potential to serve as classification parameters of a complete bio-inspired speech recognition system. Also, no voice activity detection is required and there are no hard decisions to be taken by the system. Events are used to label and identify the moments at which the acoustical properties of speech are stable or changing. These events are markers on which an analysis window can be positioned to perform the recognition. Inspired by our knowledge of the auditory and visual systems, hierarchical complex features like transients and energy orientation are used. Training has been done on clean speech and recognition on noisy (from 20dB to -10dB Signal to Noise Ratios -SNR) or reverberated speech by using the TI 46-word database corrupted with 4 noises taken from the Aurora 2 data. In comparison with a FFR recognizer, our VFR system yields more than 50% increase in recognition rates for a speaker independent isolated word recognition task when SNRs are between 0 and 20 dB.

Being an indoor environment, wireless transmitted signals in underground narrow-vein mines suffer multiple kinds of distortions due to extreme multipath and non-line of sight (NLOS) conditions. One of the proposed solutions to accurate localization in such challenging environments is based on extracting the channel impulse response (CIR) of the received signal and using the fingerprinting technique combined with cooperative artificial neural networks (ANNs). Such localization systems use the spatial domain where the reference localizing units are implemented at different positions away from the transmitter. In this article, we introduce a localization technique that uses fingerprints successively recorded in time with in-built tracking as an alternative method to localize. Unlike the spatial-domain technique where cooperative localizing units collect memoryless fingerprints from different locations, this technique uses one localizing unit and is capable of estimating the position of a transmitter precisely using its current and previous registered fingerprints in time. Localization using time-domain fingerprinting (i.e., tracking) and ANNs is introduced as a new method that exploits time diversity and improves the accuracy, precision and scalability of the positioning system.

In response, three bodies-the British Medical Association (BMA); the Commission de l'ethique de la Science et de la technologie (CEST) du Quebec; the American Academy of Neurology (AAN)-have produced reports and guidance on this topic. To gain insights into different public policy approaches, rationales, and recommendations on the topic, we analyzed these reports in depth. We found convergence on the definition (with the exception of the CEST) of cognitive enhancement. However, we noted a lack of critical reflection with respect to the underlying rationale for developing these reports, i.e., that cognitive enhancement practices are rampant and represent major social changes. As it currently stands, cognitive enhancement is constituted in a way that challenges the creation of coherent and effective policy recommendations. However, policy makers should not simply wait for definitional consensus and hope that on balance the benefits turn out to be greater than the risks. Some components of cognitive enhancement could be reduced down to clearly identified policy targets to be further examined. Then, if appropriate, policy should be created that is, amongst other criteria, beneficial to the majority of the population.

J	Faregh, N; Derevensky, J				Faregh, Neda; Derevensky, Jeffrey			A comparative latent class analysis of endorsement profiles of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for problem gambling among adolescents from a community and a treatment sample	ADDICTION RESEARCH & THEORY			English	Article						Gambling; substance dependence; SDM-IV criteria; latent class analysis; adolescents; gender difference	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLERS; SALIVARY CORTISOL; ALCOHOL; COMORBIDITY; IMPULSIVITY; YOUTH; MODEL	The DSM-IV approach to gambling taxonomy is predicated upon the number of diagnostic criteria with little regard for the nature of the specific items. This study examined the variation in gambling pathology that might exist due to the specific pattern of DSM-IV criteria endorsement, these differences between genders, and in the presence of prior addictions. The likelihood of item endorsement for the DSM-IV criteria for males and females in a community and a treatment sample of adolescents with known prior history of substance abuse was examined. A significant gender effect was found for several DSM-IV items in the community sample but not in the treatment sample. Latent class analyses identified different subtypes or classes of endorsement patterns of DSM-IV gambling criteria in adolescents which differed according to whether we looked at males or females in a community sample of adolescents or at a group of treatment adolescents. The results suggest that there may be a divergence in the pathways that male and female adolescent gamblers negotiate depending on the nature of their gambling behaviours. There seems to be a pathway with physiological components and a separate pathway involving antisocial behaviours. Furthermore, male and female adolescent gamblers with prior addictions have a pattern of gambling behaviours in which the vulnerability to gambling problems is more likely to involve behaviours with physiological or neuroadaptive components than antisocial behaviours and this vulnerability is particularly acute for female substance-dependent gamblers where the development of tolerance plays an especially important role.</.

Briefly, AIS is defined as a lateral curvature of the spine combined with vertebral rotation that occurs in patients of 10 years of age or older until bone maturity (18-20 years of age). AIS is predominant in females. If untreated, the curvature could evolve with negative long-term prognosis including psychosocial impact, back pain, pulmonary compromise, cor pulmonale, and even death due to respiratory failure. Causes of the disease have been postulated to involve genetics, abnormal muscle, connective tissue and bone structures, and neuroendocrine disorders. Psychological pathways have also been studied. Little data, however, have been collected on bone turnover in these patients. Some studies demonstrated decreased bone mineral density which may be suggestive of increased osteoblast activity. Other studies suggested a correlation to abnormal platelet morphology. Alterations in the spinal muscle contractile function may be responsible for spinal curvature. Measurement of trace elements in serum revealed impaired zinc and selenium metabolism, probably secondary to hormonal deregulation. Subsequent endocrine studies suggested a role for leptin and growth hormone in AIS. Recently, a neuroendocrine hypothesis has been proposed. This theory involves a unique melatonin-signaling dysfunction and opens new frontiers in the elucidation of the pathologic mechanisms for onset and progression of this disease.

Here we consider the problem of routing in multistage interconnection networks (MIN). In our previously reported research we proposed a method to find the best path in a graph. In this paper, we use our algorithm which is based on neural network for routing in MINs. In this algorithm, we define a suitable energy function; the minimum of this function correspond to a valid route. By using gradient descent method, the energy is minimized at the convergence of neural network. Simulation results show that this method finds a valid path between source and destination and because neurons act in parallel, the performance is comparable with other approaches.

The Neurocognition of Conduct Disorder Behaviors: Specificity to Physical Aggression and Theft After Controlling for ADHD Symptoms	AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR			English	Article						conduct disorder; physical aggression; theft; ADHD; neurocognition; latent growth curves	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; LIFE-COURSE-PERSISTENT; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION; DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL ACTIVATION; FOLLOW-UP	There is growing evidence that among the different conduct disorder (CD) behaviors, physical aggression, but not theft, links to low neurocognitive abilities. Specifically, physical aggression has consistently been found to be negatively related to neurocognitive abilities, whereas theft has been shown to be either positively or not related to neurocognition. The specificity of these links needs further examination because attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) links to both physical aggression and neurocognitive variation. The development of self-reported physical aggression and theft, from age 11 to 17 years, was studied in a prospective at-risk male cohort via a dual process latent growth curve model. Seven neurocognitive tests at age 20 were regressed on the growth parameters of physical aggression and theft. The links between neurocognition and the growth parameters of physical aggression and theft were adjusted for ADHD symptoms at ages 11 and 15 (parent, child and teacher reports). Results indicated that verbal abilities were negatively related to physical aggression while they were positively associated with theft. However, inductive reasoning was negatively associated with increases in theft across adolescence. Symptoms of ADHD accounted for part of the neurocognitive test links with physical aggression but did not account for the associations with theft. These differences emphasize the importance of examining specific CD behaviors to better understand their neurodevelopmental mechanisms. They also suggest that youth who engage in different levels of physical aggression or theft behaviors may require different preventive and corrective interventions. Aggr. Behav. 37:63-72, 2011.

The time course of priming was tracked in the cerebral hemispheres across three SOAs: 150, 300, and 750 ms. The results showed older and young adults had the same level of accuracy. While priming occurred unilaterally in young participants, the pattern of priming in older participants appeared to be bilateral whenever it was present, that is, at the 300- and 750-ms SOAs. The delay in the appearance of priming in older adults may be due to an increase in sensory thresholds that causes older adults to need more time to encode stimuli and fully activate their semantic network. It is concluded that the bilateral pattern of priming in the presence of an equivalent level of performance in older adults provides behavioral evidence supporting the compensatory role of the HAROLD phenomenon for this particular task.

Differences in case ascertainment, methodological biases, cultural and educational influences on test performance, inclusion of special populations such as underrepresented minorities and the oldest old, and detection of the earliest symptomatic stages of underlying AD have been considered. Classification of Alzheimer dementia may be improved by the incorporation of biomarkers for AD if the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of the biomarkers are established and if they are appropriate for epidemiological studies, as may occur should a plasma biomarker be developed. Biomarkers for AD could also facilitate studies of the interactions of various forms of neurodegenerative disorders with cerebrovascular disease, resulting in "mixed dementia".

Genotype-Phenotype Analysis of the Branchio-Oculo-Facial Syndrome	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A			English	Article						branchio-oculo-facial syndrome; cleft lip/palate; mutation analysis; neurocristopathy; TFAP2A	CHARGE SYNDROME; INTERSTITIAL DELETION; MOLECULAR ANALYSES; INNER-EAR; TFAP2A; PATIENT; AP-2	Branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS; OMIM# 113620) is a rare autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder with variable expression. Major features include cutaneous and ocular abnormalities, characteristic facies, renal, ectodermal, and temporal bone anomalies. Having determined that mutations involving TFAP2A result in BOFS, we studied a total of 30 families (41 affected individuals); 26/30 (87%) fulfilled our cardinal diagnostic criteria. The original family with the 3.2Mb deletion including the TFAP2A gene remains the only BOFS family without the typical CL/P and the only family with a deletion. We have identified a hotspot region in the highly conserved exons 4 and 5 of TFAP2A that harbors missense mutations in 27/30 (90%) families. Several of these mutations are recurrent. Mosaicism was detected in one family. To date, genetic heterogeneity has not been observed. Although the cardinal criteria for BOFS have been based on the presence of each of the core defects, an affected family member or thymic remnant, we documented TFAP2A mutations in three (10%) probands in our series without a classic cervical cutaneous defect or ectopic thymus. Temporal bone anomalies were identified in 3/5 patients investigated. The occurrence of CL/P, premature graying, coloboma, heterochromiairides, and ectopic thymus, are evidence for BOFS as a neurocristopathy. Intrafamilial clinical variability can be marked. Although there does not appear to be mutation-specific genotype-phenotype correlations at this time, more patients need to be studied. Clinical testing for TFAP2A mutations is now available and will assist geneticists in confirming the typical cases or excluding the diagnosis in atypical cases. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Neprilysin-2 Is an Important beta-Amyloid Degrading Enzyme	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; A-BETA; TRANSGENIC MODEL; MOUSE MODEL; ZINC-METALLOPEPTIDASE; PLAQUE-FORMATION; PREMATURE DEATH; BRAIN; MICE; OVEREXPRESSION	Proteases that degrade the amyloid-p peptide (A beta) are important in protecting against Alzheimer's disease (AD), and understanding these proteases is critical to understanding AD pathology. Endopeptidases sensitive to inhibition by thiorphan and phosphoramidon are especially important, because these inhibitors induce dramatic A beta accumulation (similar to 30- to 50-fold) and pathological deposition in rodents. The A beta-degrading enzyme neprilysin (NEP) is the best known target of these inhibitors. However, genetic ablation of NEP results in only modest increases (similar to 1.5- to 2-fold) in A beta, indicating that other thiorphan/phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidases are at work. Of particular interest is the NEP homolog neprilysin 2 (NEP2), which is thiorphan/phosphoramidon-sensitive and degrades A. We investigated the role of NEP2 in A beta degradation in vivo through the use of gene knockout and transgenic mice. Mice deficient for the NEP2 gene showed significant elevations in total A beta species in the hippocampus and brainstem/diencephalon (similar to 1.5-fold). Increases in A beta accumulation were more dramatic in NEP2 knockout mice crossbred with APP transgenic mice. In NEP/NEP2 double-knockout mice, A beta levels were marginally increased (similar to 1.5- to 2-fold), compared with NEP(-/-)/NEP2(+/+) controls. Treatment of these double-knockout mice with phosphoramidon resulted in elevations of A beta, suggesting that yet other NEP-like A beta-degrading endopeptidases are contributing to A beta catabolism.

Quality of sleep is negatively affected with frequent patient-ventilator asynchronies and more specifically with modes of ventilation. The quality of sleep among ventilated patients seems to be related in part to the alteration between the capacities of the ventilator to meet patient demand. The objective of this study was to compare the impact of two modes of ventilation and patient-ventilator interaction on sleep architecture. Methods: Prospective, comparative crossover study in 14 conscious, nonsedated, mechanically ventilated adults, during weaning in a university hospital medical intensive care unit. Patients were successively ventilated in a random ordered cross-over sequence with neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and pressure support ventilation (PSV). Sleep polysomnography was performed during four 4-hour periods, two with each mode in random order. Results: The tracings of the flow, airway pressure, and electrical activity of the diaphragm were used to diagnose central apneas and ineffective efforts. The main abnormalities were a low percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, for a median (25th-75th percentiles) of 11.5% (range, 8-20%) of total sleep, and a highly fragmented sleep with 25 arousals and awakenings per hour of sleep. Proportions of REM sleep duration were different in the two ventilatory modes (4.5% (range, 3-11%) in PSV and 16.5% (range, 13-29%) during NAVA (p = 0.001)), as well as the fragmentation index, with 40 +/- 20 arousals and awakenings per hour in PSV and 16 +/- 9 during NAVA (p = 0.001). There were large differences in ineffective efforts (24 +/- 23 per hour of sleep in PSV, and 0 during NAVA) and episodes of central apnea (10.5 +/- 11 in PSV vs. 0 during NAVA). Minute ventilation was similar in both modes. Conclusions: NAVA improves the quality of sleep over PSV in terms of REM sleep, fragmentation index, and ineffective efforts in a nonsedated adult population.

Methods: Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) with >= 1 documented relapse in 12 months prior to screening, or >= 2 documented relapses in 24 months prior to screening, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 0 to 5.5 were enrolled. Patients were evaluated at screening, baseline, and at months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Primary endpoint was rate of confirmed relapses observed during 12-month study. Analysis was by intent-to-treat. Results: A total of 1,155 patients randomized to GA 20mg (n = 586) or 40mg (n = 569). The groups were well-matched at baseline on demographic, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics. The primary endpoint was similar in both groups (relative risk [RR] = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.31; p = 0.486) with mean annualized relapse rates (ARRs) of 0.33 for the 20mg group, 0.35 for the 40mg group, and 0.27 for patients from both groups who completed the entire 1-year treatment. A total of 77% of patients remained relapse-free in both groups. Both groups showed a reduction in mean number of gadolinium-enhancing and new T2 lesions over time with trend for faster reduction in the first trimester with the 40mg dose compared with 20mg dose. Both doses were well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to that observed in previous studies of 20mg GA. Interpretation: In relapsing-remitting MS patients, both the currently-approved GA 20mg and 40mg doses were safe and well-tolerated, with no gain in efficacy for the higher dose.

The execution of successful collision-avoidance behaviors requires accurate processing of approaching threats by the visual system and signaling of threat characteristics to motor circuits to execute appropriate motor programs in a timely manner. Consequently, visually guided collision avoidance offers an excellent model with which to study the neural mechanisms of sensory-motor integration in the context of a natural behavior. Neurons that selectively respond to approaching threats and brain areas processing them have been characterized across many species. In locusts in particular, the underlying sensory and motor processes have been analyzed in great detail: These animals possess an identified neuron, called the LGMD, that responds selectively to approaching threats and conveys that information through a second identified neuron, the DCMD, to motor centers, generating escape jumps. A combination of behavioral and in vivo electrophysiological experiments has unraveled many of the cellular and network mechanisms underlying this behavior.

This study was conducted in an acute care early rehabilitation setting on 102 patients with mild, 30 with moderate, and 30 with severe TBI. Patients with moderate and severe TBI showed more impairment on the CDT compared with those with mild TBI. Similar results were obtained for the MMSE, F-(2,F-159df)= 3.789, p = .025. Finally, a receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that the CDT and the Trail-Making Test-Part B (TMT-B) in combination have the potential for prediction of outcome in a TBI population. In conclusion, this combination of the CDT and the TMT-B seems to be useful for early assessment of TBI patients.

Accordingly, we have characterized the functional and pharmacological profile of a BK channel from rat brain mitochondria in the present study. Brain mitochondrial inner membrane preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and channel protein reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers. Western blotting and antibodies directed against various cellular proteins revealed that mitochondrial inner membrane fractions did not contain specific proteins of the other subcellular compartments except a very small fraction of endoplasmic reticulum. Channel incorporation into planar lipid bilayers revealed a voltage dependent 211 pS potassium channel with a voltage for half activation (V(1/2)) of 11.4 +/- 1.1 mV and an effective gating charge z(d) of 4.7 +/- 0.9. Gating and conducting behaviors of this channel were unaffected by the addition of 2.5 mM ATP, and 500 nM charybdotoxin (ChTx), but the channel appeared sensitive to 100 nM iberiotoxin (IbTx). Adding 10 mM TEA at positive potentials and 10 mM 4-AP at negative or positive voltages inhibited the channel activities. These results demonstrate that the mitoBK channel, present in brain mitochondrial inner membrane, displays different pharmacological properties than those classically described for plasma membrane, especially in regard to its sensitivity to iberiotoxin and charybdotoxin sensitivity.

However, the developmental consequences of high folate intake are unknown. This study investigated the impact of high folate intake, alone or with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency, on embryonic and placental development in mice. METHODS: Mthfr +/+ or +/- pregnant mice on a control diet (CD; recommended intake of folic acid for rodents) or folic acid-supplemented diet (FASD; 20-fold higher than the recommended intake) were examined for embryonic loss, delay, and defects at 10.5 and 14.5 days post coitum (dpc); 10.5-dpc placenta, and 14.5-dpc embryo hearts were studied histologically. RESULTS: Total plasma folate was 10-fold higher in FASD compared to CD mice; plasma homocysteine levels were not affected by diet. At 10.5 dpc, the FASD was associated with embryonic delay and growth retardation, and may confer susceptibility to embryonic defects. The FASD did not adversely affect 10.5-dpc placental development. At 14.5 dpc, embryos from the FASD Mthfr +/+ group were delayed and the FASD was associated with thinner ventricular walls in embryonic hearts. There was a significant interaction between maternal MTHFR deficiency and a high folate diet for several developmental outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that high folate intake may have adverse effects on fetal mouse development and that maternal MTHFR deficiency may improve or rescue some of the adverse outcomes. These findings underscore the need for additional studies on the potential negative impact of high folate intake during pregnancy. Birth Defects Research (Part A) 91:8-19, 2011.

Researchers in Sydney conducted a prospective controlled study which identified that bedside recordings of memory impairment together with recordings of moderate or severe pain could predict those who would suffer PCS with 80% sensitivity and specificity of 76%. Primary objective: This study is a cross-validation study of the Sydney predictive model conducted at Montreal General Hospital, Montreal, Canada. Methods: One hundred and seven patients were assessed in the Emergency Department following a MTBI and followed up by phone at 3 months. The Rivermead Post-Concussive Questionnaire was the main outcome measure. Results: Regression analysis showed that immediate verbal recall and quantitative recording of headache was able to predict PCD with a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 63.3%. In the combined MTBI groups from Sydney and Montreal the sensitivity was 70.2% and the specificity was 64.2%. Conclusion: This is the first study to compare populations from different countries with diverse language groups using a predictive model for identifying PCD following MTBI. The model may be able to identify an 'at risk' population to whom pre-emptive treatment can be offered.

The pattern of muscle synergies is generated in the spinal cord, whereas neural centers located above the spinal cord in the brainstem and the forebrain are essential for initiating and controlling locomotor movements. One such locomotor control center in the brainstem is the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), first discovered in cats and later found in all vertebrate species tested to date. Over the last years, we have investigated the cellular mechanisms by which this locomotor region operates in lampreys. The lamprey MLR is a well-circumscribed region located at the junction between the midbrain and hindbrain. Stimulation of the MLR induces locomotion with an intensity that increases with the stimulation strength. Glutamatergic and cholinergic monosynaptic inputs from the MLR are responsible for excitation of reticulospinal (RS) cells that in turn activate the spinal locomotor networks. The inputs are larger in the rostral than in the caudal hindbrain RS cells. MLR stimulation on one side elicits symmetrical excitatory inputs in RS cells on both sides, and this is linked to bilateral projections of the MLR to RS cells. In addition to its inputs to RS cells, the MLR activates a well-defined group of muscarinoceptive cells in the brainstem that feeds back strong excitation to RS cells in order to amplify the locomotor output. Finally, the MLR gates sensory inputs to the brainstem through a muscarinic mechanism. It appears therefore that the MLR not only controls locomotor activity but also filters sensory influx during locomotion.

How this is accomplished still remains an intriguing mystery. This chapter first describes classical and recent findings relevant to understanding the complexity of the question on the verge of several fields of neurophysiology, biomechanics, and computational neuroscience. Then, control of locomotion is analyzed with numerical simulations to reveal some basic characteristics responsible for modulation of the locomotor rhythm and high-level control of steering in the whole animal. In this study, the concept of a central pattern generator (CPG) for controlling locomotor rhythm first proposed by Brown was implemented in a "simple" model with bilateral half-center oscillators consisting of reciprocally organized integrators. The parameters of the CPG were determined by the process of optimization of its phase-duration characteristic that satisfies biomechanical requirements of the overground locomotion. The general finding of this study is that the modality of the control signal that drives CPGs for each limb corresponds to the desired speed of forward progression. This supports the idea that the descending and sensory feedback inputs to the spinal CPG are combined to produce a high-level control signal that sets forward velocity. The same mechanism may be responsible for the control of steering by generating a differential input of speed commands to different limbs.

Method: The sample included 2162 adolescents from Quebec disadvantaged community high schools, with an annual follow-up for 5 years. Path analysis was used to predict ecstasy use initiation in secondary 5 (aged 16 to 17 years) from predictors in secondary 1 and 2 (aged 12 to 14 years) and in secondary 4 (aged 15 to 16 years). Results: Secondary 5 adolescents initiating ecstasy use showed a higher risk on multiple factors, compared with nonusers. Initiation was mainly predicted by proximal risk factors related to individual use as well as peer use and deviance. Nevertheless, many proximal factors developed consistently with their corresponding distal factor (indirect link). Marijuana use was the strongest predictor of ecstasy use initiation. All things being equal, relative risk was 2.04 times higher in adolescents having used marijuana in the past year (secondary 4). Conclusions: Ecstasy use initiation in secondary 5 seems to be globally related to an externalized, rather than internalized, profile. This ecstasy use was strongly associated with other substance use and likely shares many risk factors with other substance use, specifically marijuana use.

A possible explanation for treatment failure resides in the capacity of glioma cells to infiltrate the brain parenchyma and therefore escape surgical removal and radiation exposure. One of the most promising novel strategies in glioma therapy is to use the patient's immune system to attack the tumor. Cytotoxic effector cells are crucial components of the immune system to fight cancers; genetically modified cytotoxic T cells that recognize tumor antigens can destroy cancer cells. Glioma cells, on the other hand, use several strategies to escape this immunological attack. In a recent study, Hoa and colleagues reported that cell surface expression of microvilli protects gliomas from being killed by cytotoxic effector cells.

Methods Forty-two patients were randomized to receive bortezomib 1.0 or 1.3 mg/m(2), days 1, 4, 8, 11, for up to eight 21-day treatment cycles (n = 21, each dose group). Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis were taken on days 1 and 11, cycles 1 and 3. Observational efficacy and safety data were collected. Results Twelve patients in each dose group were evaluable for pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. Plasma clearance decreased with repeat dosing (102-112 L/h for first dose; 15-32 L/h following repeat dosing), with associated increases in systemic exposure and terminal half-life. Systemic exposures of bortezomib were similar between dose groups considering the relatively narrow dose range and the observed pharmacokinetic variability, although there was no readily apparent deviation from dose-proportionality. Blood 20S proteasome inhibition profiles were similar between groups with mean maximum inhibition ranging from 70 to 84% and decreasing toward baseline over the dosing interval. Response rate (all 42 patients) was 50%, including 7% complete responses. The safety profile was consistent with the predictable and manageable profile previously established; data suggested milder toxicity in the 1.0 mg/m(2) group. Conclusions Bortezomib pharmacokinetics change with repeat dose administration, characterized by a reduction in plasma clearance and associated increase in systemic exposure. Bortezomib is pharmacodynamically active and tolerable at 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m(2) doses, with recovery toward baseline blood proteasome activity over the dosing interval following repeat dose administration, supporting the current clinical dosing regimen.

Identification and development of neuroprotective therapies for such diseases has proven a major challenge, particularly because of an already substantial neuroaxonal compromise at the time of initial onset of clinical symptoms. Methods for early identification of neurodegeneration are therefore vital to ensure that neuroprotective therapies are applied as early as possible. Recent investigations have enhanced our understanding of the role of neuroaxonal injury in multiple sclerosis (MS). As MS generally manifests earlier in life and can be diagnosed much earlier in the course of the disease than the above-mentioned 'classic' neurodegenerative diseases, it is possible that MS could be used as a model disease to study degeneration and regeneration of the CNS. The mechanism of neuroaxonal injury in MS is believed to be inflammation-led neurodegeneration; however, the reverse may also be true (i.e. neuroaxonal degeneration may precede inflammation). Animal models of PD, AD and ALS have shown that it is likely that most cases of disease are due to initial inflammation, followed by a degenerative process, providing a parallel between MS and the classic neurodegenerative diseases. Other common factors between MS and the neurodegenerative diseases include iron and mitochondrial dysregulation, abnormalities in alpha-synuclein and tau protein, and a number of immune mediators. Conventional MRI techniques, using markers such as T2-weighted lesions, gadolinium-enhancing lesions and T1-weighted hypointensities, are readily available and routinely used in clinical practice; however, the utility of these MRI measures to predict disease progression in MS is limited. More recently, MRI techniques that provide more pathology-specific data have been applied in MS studies, including magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetization transfer ratio and myelin water imaging. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-MRI technique that quantifies optic nerve integrity and retinal ganglion cell loss as markers of neuroaxonal injury; more research is needed to evaluate whether information obtained from OCT is a reliable marker of axonal injury and long-term disability in MS. Using these advanced techniques, it may become possible to follow degeneration and regeneration longitudinally in patients with MS and to better differentiate the effects of drugs under investigation. Currently available immune-directed therapies that are approved by the US FDA for the first-line treatment of MS (interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate) have been shown to decelerate the inflammatory process in MS; however, such therapy is less effective in preventing the progression of the disease and neuroaxonal injury. The use of MS as a clinical model to study modulation of neuroaxonal injury in the brain could have direct implications for the development of treatment strategies in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD and ALS.

Extracting features is a key component in the analysis of EEG signals. In our previous works, we have implemented many EEG feature extraction functions in the Python programming language. As Python is gaining more ground in scientific computing, an open source Python module for extracting EEG features has the potential to save much time for computational neuroscientists. In this paper, we introduce PyEEG, an open source Python module for EEG feature extraction.

Neural excitation of muscles was attained based on inverse dynamics approach along with a stability-based optimisation. The trunk flexion and extension movements between 608 flexion and the upright posture against various resistance levels were simulated. Incorporation of the stability constraint in the optimisation algorithm required higher antagonistic activities for all resistance levels mostly close to the upright position. Extension movements showed higher coactivation with higher resistance, whereas flexion movements demonstrated lower coactivation indicating a greater stability demand in backward extension movements against higher resistance at the neighbourhood of the upright posture. Optimal extension profiles based on minimum jerk, work and power had distinct kinematics profiles which led to recruitment patterns with different timing and amplitude of activation.

Here, experiments isolating specific aspects of decision making, using very simple preference judgment and reinforcement learning paradigms, were carried out in patients with focal frontal damage. The orbitofrontal cortex and the adjacent ventromedial prefrontal cortex play a critical role in decisions based on subjective value, across many categories of stimuli, and in learning to choose between stimuli based on value feedback. However, these regions are not required for learning to choose between actions based on feedback, which instead seems to rely critically on the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These results point to a potentially common role for the orbitofrontal cortex in representing the context-sensitive, subjective value of stimuli to allow consistent choices between them. They also argue for multiple, parallel, value-based processes that influence behavior through dissociable mechanisms.

Enhanced right amygdala activity in adolescents during encoding of positively valenced pictures	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Adolescents; Adults; Encoding; Positive stimuli; Amygdala; Hippocampus		While studies among adults implicate the amygdala and interconnecting brain regions in encoding emotional stimuli, few studies have examined whether developmental changes occur within this emotional-memory network during adolescence. The present study examined whether adolescents and adults differentially engaged the amygdala and hippocampus during successful encoding of emotional pictures, with either positive or negative valence. Eighteen adults and twelve adolescents underwent event-related fMRI while encoding emotional pictures. Approximately 30 min later, outside the scanner, subjects were asked to recall the pictures seen during the scan. Age group differences in brain activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during encoding of the pictures that were later successfully and unsuccessfully recalled were separately compared for the positive and negative pictures. Adolescents, relative to adults, demonstrated enhanced activity in the right amygdala during encoding of positive pictures that were later recalled compared to not recalled. There were no age group differences in amygdala or hippocampal activity during successful encoding of negative pictures. The findings of preferential activity within the adolescent right amygdala during successful encoding of positive pictures may have implications for the increased reward and novelty seeking behavior, as well as elevated rates of psychopathology, observed during this distinct developmental period.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we compared 14 youths with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), a genetic disorder of hormonal dysfunction, with 22 healthy controls on memory encoding of emotional faces. Patients remembered fewer faces than controls, particularly fearful faces. FMRI data to successfully encoded fearful faces revealed that males with CAH showed significant activations in amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate relative to unaffected males, while females with CAH demonstrated deactivations relative to unaffected females in these regions. Findings indicate that steroid abnormalities during development can have important effects on neural correlates of emotional memory.

Forty adolescents with TBI were assessed ten years post-injury and compared to 19 typically developing participants on a range of executive measures (attentional control, cognitive flexibility, goal setting, information processing). Children with mild or moderate TBI performed within age expectations on all tests; however, those with severe injuries had poorer performance on goal setting and processing speed tasks. Childhood TBI may result in subtle lasting changes in complex executive skills, which could require ongoing support into adulthood.

Motor performance appears to be impaired for an important sub-set of this population. Objectives: This structured review draws attention to the neurological mechanisms that could potentially explain these difficulties. Methods: In August 2010, Medline, PsychINFO and Embase databases were searched with keywords related to ADHD, neuroimaging modalities and motor performance. Results: Four studies were retrieved that examined both motor performance and possible neural substrates. Each study explored different hypotheses and no common conclusion is emerging. The cortical activation dysregulation hypothesis, the cerebellar dysfunction hypothesis and the delayed white matter maturation hypothesis were proposed, applying combinations of motor observations and neuroimaging findings. Conclusion: Published literature to date is insufficient to confirm specific hypotheses. Additional studies coupling discrete motor evaluations to neuroimaging techniques are needed in children with ADHD to better understand the neurobiological mechanisms of their motor difficulties.

While predicting the impact of a NIS has generally proved challenging, forecasting its abundance patterns across potential recipient locations should serve as a useful surrogate method of estimating the relative severity of the impacts to be expected. Yet such approaches have rarely been applied in invasion biology. We used long-term monitoring data for lakes within the state of Minnesota and artificial neural networks to model both the occurrence as well as the abundance of a widespread aquatic NIS, common carp (Cyprinus carpio). We then tested the ability of the resulting models to (1) interpolate to new sites within our main study region, (2) extrapolate to lakes in the neighboring state of South Dakota, and (3) assessed the relative contribution of each variable to model predictions. Our models correctly identified over 83% of sites where carp are either present or absent and explained 73% of the variation in carp abundance for validation lakes in Minnesota (i.e., lakes not used to build the model). When extrapolated to South Dakota, our models correctly classified carp occurrence in 79% of lakes and explained 32% of the variation in carp abundance. Variables related to climate and water quality were found to be the most important predictors of carp distribution. These results demonstrate that ecological niche-based modeling techniques can be used to forecast both the occurrence and abundance patterns of invasive species at a regional scale. Models also yielded sensible predictions when extrapolated to neighboring regions. Such predictions, when combined, should provide more useful estimates of the overall risk posed by NIS on potential recipient systems.

Despite the common occurrence of manganese in groundwater, the risks associated with this source of exposure are largely unknown. Objectives: Our first aim was to assess the relations between exposure to manganese from drinking water and children's intelligence quotient (IQ). Second, we examined the relations between manganese exposures from water consumption and from the diet with children's hair manganese concentration. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 362 children 6-13 years of age living in communities supplied by groundwater. Manganese concentration was measured in home tap water (MnW) and children's hair (MnH). We estimated manganese intake from water ingestion and the diet using a food frequency questionnaire and assessed IQ with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Results: The median MnW in children's home tap water was 34 mu g/L (range, 1-2,700 mu g/L). MnH increased with manganese intake from water consumption, but not with dietary manganese intake. Higher MnW and MnH were significantly associated with lower IQ scores. A 10-fold increase in MnW was associated with a decrease of 2.4 IQ points (95% confidence interval: -3.9 to -0.9; p < 0.01), adjusting for maternal intelligence, family income, and other potential confounders. There was a 6.2-point difference in IQ between children in the lowest and highest MnW quintiles. MnW was more strongly associated with Performance IQ than Verbal IQ. Conclusions: The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that exposure to manganese at levels common in groundwater is associated with intellectual impairment in children.

In Brazil, elevated hair Mn concentrations were reported in children living near a ferro-manganese alloy plant. Objectives: We investigated these children's and caregivers' cognitive function in relation to bio-indicators of Mn exposure. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the WISC-III was administered to 83 children aged between 6 and 12 years; the Raven Progressive Matrix was administered to the primary caregivers (94% mothers), who likewise responded to a questionnaire on socio demographics and birth history. Mn in hair (MnH) and blood (MnB) and blood lead (PbB) were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). Results: Children's mean MnB and MnH were 8.2 mu g/L (2.7-23.4) and 5.83 mu g/g (0.1-86.68), respectively. Mean maternal MnH was 3.50 mu g/g (0.10-77.45) and correlated to children's MnH (rho=0.294, p=0.010). Children's MnH was negatively related to Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and Verbal IQ; beta coefficients for MnH were -5.78 (95% Cl -10.71 to -0.21) and -6.72 ( -11.81 to -0.63), adjusted for maternal education and nutritional status. Maternal MnH was negatively associated with performance on the Raven's (beta=-2.69, 95% CI -5.43 to 0.05), adjusted for education years, family income and age. Conclusions: These findings confirm that high MnH in children is associated with poorer cognitive performance, especially in the verbal domain. Primary caregiver's IQ is likewise associated to Mn exposure, suggesting that, in this situation, children's cognition may be affected directly and indirectly by Mn exposure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A broad spectrum of histopathology has been included in the diagnosis of FCD. An ILAE task force proposes an international consensus classification system to better characterize specific clinicopathological FCD entities. Methods: Thirty-two Task Force members have reevaluated available data on electroclinical presentation, imaging, neuropathological examination of surgical specimens as well as postsurgical outcome. Key Findings: The ILAE Task Force proposes a three-tiered classification system. FCD Type I refers to isolated lesions, which present either as radial (FCD Type Ia) or tangential (FCD Type Ib) dyslamination of the neocortex, microscopically identified in one or multiple lobes. FCD Type II is an isolated lesion characterized by cortical dyslamination and dysmorphic neurons without (Type IIa) or with balloon cells (Type IIb). Hence, the major change since a prior classification represents the introduction of FCD Type III, which occurs in combination with hippocampal sclerosis (FCD Type IIIa), or with epilepsy-associated tumors (FCD Type IIIb). FCD Type IIIc is found adjacent to vascular malformations, whereas FCD Type IIId can be diagnosed in association with epileptogenic lesions acquired in early life (i.e., traumatic injury, ischemic injury or encephalitis). Significance: This three-tiered classification system will be an important basis to evaluate imaging, electroclinical features, and postsurgical seizure control as well as to explore underlying molecular pathomechanisms in FCD.

Study design: All patients with NECC diagnosed between January 1990 and December, 2007 identified from the tumor registry and gynecological oncology databases at McGill University Health Centre comprised this series. Results: Eleven cases were encountered. Four patients were FIGO Stage Ib1, one Stage Ib2, one Stage Ha, and the other five were advanced stages (III or IV). Ten patients had marked lymph vascular space invasion. Metastasis to the pelvic or paraortic nodes was observed in eight patients. Seven patients were treated by surgery followed by adjuvant chemoradiation, another two had chemoradiation and the other two only received palliative treatments. The median survival was 18 months. All three long-term survival patients were Stage Ib1 without lymph node involvement. Conclusion: NECC is an aggressive tumor with poor prognosis, and only early stages are potentially curable.

GAP Study Grp	The Global Adherence Project (GAP): a multicenter observational study on adherence to disease-modifying therapies in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						adherence; disease-modifying therapy; glatiramer acetate; interferon; multiple sclerosis	INTERFERON BETA-1A; QUESTIONNAIRE; DEPRESSION; IMPAIRMENT; MEDICATION; PATTERNS; MS	Background: Most disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) are self-injectable medications that must be taken on an ongoing basis to reduce disease activity. Thus, adherence to therapy becomes an important challenge that must be addressed to maximize benefits of therapy. This study evaluated rates of adherence to prescribed treatment and explored factors affecting adherence amongst patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Methods: This was an observational, multicenter, multinational, phase 4 study. Patients and physicians received paper questionnaires regarding adherence to DMTs approved at the time of the study, including intramuscular interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a), subcutaneous IFN beta-1a, IFN beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate. Quality of life and cognition data also were collected. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with adherence to long-term DMTs. Results: Two thousand six hundred and forty-eight patients were studied, revealing an average treatment duration of 31 months. Seventy-five percent of patients (n = 1923) were adherent to therapy. The most common reasons for non-adherence were forgetting to administer the injection (50.2%) and other injection-related reasons (32.0%). Adherent patients reported better quality of life (P < 0.05) and fewer neuropsychological issues (P < 0.001) than non-adherent patients. Adherent patients had significantly shorter duration of disease (P < 0.001) and shorter duration of therapy (P = 0.005) than non-adherent patients. Women were more likely than men to adhere to treatment. Conclusion: Identifying factors that affect adherence to prescribed treatments is the first step in improving adherence of patients with MS to therapy, thereby helping maximize the benefits of long-term DMTs.

Aims: Utilizing imaging findings from a population-based registry (REPACQ), the frequency and proportion of cerebral radiologic abnormalities in children CP over a four year birth cohort was investigated. Methods: Descriptions of CT and MRI studies were extracted from the Registry dataset and classified into 10 distinct categories. Results: Two hundred and thirteen children had imaging available (119 males, 94 females, mean age of 44 months [SD. +/- 14 months] at Registry inscription). Eighty seven percent of participants had documented cerebral abnormalities, the most common of which were periventricular white matter injury (PVWMI) (19.2%), diffuse gray matter injury (14.6%), cerebral vascular accident (CVA) (11.7%), and cerebral malformation (11.3%). Also, 18.8% of participants had non-specific radiologic findings and 13.1% of participants had normal imaging results. Severe CP (i.e. GMFCS Level IV-V) and spastic quadriplegic CP were significantly associated with the neuroimaging findings of gray matter injury, while spastic hemiplegic CP was association with CVA, and dyskinetic and spastic diplegic CP were both associated with normal and non-specific neuroimaging findings. Conclusions: Specific patterns of neuroimaging findings in children with CP were found to be associated with neurological subtype, CP severity (i.e. GMFCS Level) and other categorical variables.

Horizontal body and trunk center of mass offset and standing balance in scoliotic girls	EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; Trunk; Center of mass; Center of pressure; Standing balance	ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS; PLATFORM MEASURES; POSTURAL CONTROL; RELIABILITY; PRESSURE; STANCE	In adolescent idiopathic scoliotic girls, postural imbalance is attributed to a sensory rearrangement of the motor system on the representation of the body in space. The objectives of this study were to test if the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML) and resultant body-head and trunk center of mass (COM) horizontal offsets were similar in able-bodied and scoliotic girls and if these offsets were related to the center of pressure displacements. A total of 21 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis girls and 20 able-bodied girls participated in this study. Their body COM position and that of the head and trunk were estimated according to Damavandi et al. (Med Eng Phys 31:1187-1194, 2009). The COP range and speed in both AP and ML axes were calculated from force plate measurements in quiet standing. The AP offset of the able-bodied group was anterior to the body COM by 11.0 +/- A 15.9 mm, while that of the scoliotic group was posterior to it by -17.3 +/- A 11.2 mm. The able-bodied group maintained their head-trunk segment COM more to the right by 14.1 +/- A 13.1 mm, while that of the scoliotic group was nearly over their body centerline. The scoliotic girls presented higher values for COP range and COP speed than the able-bodied girls. The resultant COM offset was correlated with both the ML COP range and speed only for the scoliotic girls. The small ML COM offset in the scoliotic girls was attributed to a compensatory action of the spinal deformity in the frontal plane resulting in a backward resultant COM offset to regain postural balance concomitant to an increase in the ML neuromuscular demand.

As executed and observed actions share common cortical representations, we hypothesized that action observation (hand movements) should also modulate the cortical response to sensory stimulation of the hand. Seventeen healthy subjects participated in these experiments in which electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of the somatosensory steady-state response (SSSR) were obtained. The SSSR provides a continuous measure of somatosensory processing. Recordings were made during a baseline condition and five observation conditions in which videos showed either a: (1) hand action; (2) passive stimulation of a hand; (3) static hand; (4) foot action; or (5) static object. The method employed consisted of applying a continuous 25 Hz vibratory stimulation to the index finger during the six conditions and measuring potential gating effects in the SSSR within the 25 Hz band (corresponding to the stimulation frequency). A significant effect of condition was found over the contralateral parietal cortex. Observation of hand actions resulted in a significant gating effect when compared to baseline (average gating of 22%). Observation of passive touch of the hand also gated the response (17% decrease). In conclusion, the results show that viewing a hand performing an action or being touched interferes with the processing of somatosensory information arising from the hand.	[Voisin, Julien I.

Interhemispheric connectivity influences the degree of modulation of TMS-induced effects during auditory processing	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; functional magnetic resonance imaging; interhemispheric functional connectivity; Heschl's gyrus; melody processing		Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to interfere with many components of language processing, including semantic, syntactic, and phonologic. However, not much is known about its effects on nonlinguistic auditory processing, especially its action on Heschl's gyrus (HG). We aimed to investigate the behavioral and neural basis of rTMS during a melody processing task, while targeting the left HG, the right HG, and the Vertex as a control site. Response times (RT) were normalized relative to the baseline-rTMS (Vertex) and expressed as percentage change from baseline (% RT change). We also looked at sex differences in rTMS-induced response as well as in functional connectivity during melody processing using rTMS and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI results showed an increase in the right HG compared with the left HG during the melody task, as well as sex differences in functional connectivity indicating a greater interhemispheric connectivity between left and right HG in females compared with males. TMS results showed that 10 Hz-rTMS targeting the right HG induced differential effects according to sex, with a facilitation of performance in females and an impairment of performance in males. We also found a differential correlation between the % RT change after 10 Hz-rTMS targeting the right HG and the interhemispheric functional connectivity between right and left HG, indicating that an increase in interhemispheric functional connectivity was associated with a facilitation of performance. This is the first study to report a differential rTMS-induced interference with melody processing depending on sex. In addition, we showed a relationship between the interference induced by rTMS on behavioral performance and the neural activity in the network connecting left and right HG, suggesting that the interhemispheric functional connectivity could determine the degree of modulation of behavioral performance.

Yet some individuals (i.e., 10-15%) are poor singers, typically performing or imitating pitches and melodies inaccurately. This condition, commonly referred to as "tone deafness," has been observed both in the presence and absence of deficient pitch perception. In this article we review the existing literature concerning normal singing, poor-pitch singing, and, briefly, the sources of this condition. Considering that pitch plays a prominent role in the structure of both music and speech we also focus on the possibility that speech production (or imitation) is similarly impaired in poor-pitch singers. Preliminary evidence from our laboratory suggests that pitch imitation may be selectively inaccurate in the music domain without being affected in speech. This finding points to separability of mechanisms subserving pitch production in music and language.

The primacy of vision is structurally imbedded in cortical organization as about one-third of the cortical surface in primates is involved in visual processes. Consequently, the loss of vision, either at birth or later in life, affects brain organization and the way the world is perceived and acted upon. In this paper, we address a number of issues on the nature of consciousness in people deprived of vision. Do brains from sighted and blind individuals differ, and how? How does the brain of someone who has never had any visual perception form an image of the external world? What is the subjective correlate of activity in the visual cortex of a subject who has never seen in life? More in general, what can we learn about the functional development of the human brain in physiological conditions by studying blindness? We discuss findings from animal research as well from recent psychophysical and functional brain imaging studies in sighted and blind individuals that shed some new light on the answers to these questions.

Language and the newborn brain: does prenatal language experience shape the neonate neural response to speech?	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						language; near-infrared spectroscopy; neonates		Previous research has shown that by the time of birth, the neonate brain responds specially to the native language when compared to acoustically similar non-language stimuli. In the current study, we use near-infrared spectroscopy to ask how prenatal language experience might shape the brain response to language in newborn infants. To do so, we examine the neural response of neonates when listening to familiar versus unfamiliar language, as well as to non language stimuli. Twenty monolingual English-exposed neonates aged 0-3 days were tested. Each infant heard low-pass filtered sentences of forward English (familiar language), forward Tagalog (unfamiliar language), and backward English and Tagalog (non-language). During exposure, neural activation was measured across 12 channels on each hemisphere. Our results indicate a bilateral effect of language familiarity on neonates' brain response to language. Differential brain activation was seen when neonates listened to forward Tagalog (unfamiliar language) as compared to other types of language stimuli. We interpret these results as evidence that the prenatal experience with the native language gained in utero influences how the newborn brain responds to language across brain regions sensitive to speech processing.

J	Samson, F; Zeffiro, TA; Toussaint, A; Belin, P				Samson, Fabienne; Zeffiro, Thomas A.; Toussaint, Alain; Belin, Pascal			Stimulus complexity and categorical effects in human auditory cortex: an Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						fMRI; category; time; frequency; hierarchy		Investigations of the functional organization of human auditory cortex typically examine responses to different sound categories. An alternative approach is to characterize sounds with respect to their amount of variation in the time and frequency domains (i.e., spectral and temporal complexity). Although the vast majority of published studies examine contrasts between discrete sound categories, an alternative complexity-based taxonomy can be evaluated through meta-analysis. In a quantitative meta-analysis of 58 auditory neuroimaging studies, we examined the evidence supporting current models of functional specialization for auditory processing using grouping criteria based on either categories or spectro-temporal complexity. Consistent with current models, analyses based on typical sound categories revealed hierarchical auditory organization and left-lateralized responses to speech sounds, with high speech sensitivity in the left anterior superior temporal cortex. Classification of contrasts based on spectro-temporal complexity, on the other hand, revealed a striking within-hemisphere dissociation in which caudo-lateral temporal regions in auditory cortex showed greater sensitivity to spectral changes, while anterior superior temporal cortical areas were more sensitive to temporal variation, consistent with recent findings in animal models. The meta-analysis thus suggests that spectro-temporal acoustic complexity represents a useful alternative taxonomy to investigate the functional organization of human auditory cortex.

We investigated whether this deficit extended to pitch processing in speech, notably the pitch changes used to contrast lexical tones in tonal languages. Congenital amusics and matched controls, all non-tonal language speakers, were tested for lexical tone discrimination in Mandarin Chinese (Experiment 1) and in Thai (Experiment 2). Tones were presented in pairs and participants were required to make same/different judgments. Experiment 2 additionally included musical analogs of Thai tones for comparison. Performance of congenital amusics was inferior to that of controls for all materials, suggesting a domain-general pitch-processing deficit. The pitch deficit of amusia is thus not limited to music, but may compromise the ability to process and learn tonal languages. Combined with acoustic analyses of the tone material, the present findings provide new insights into the nature of the pitch-processing deficit exhibited by amusics.

Relevance of spectral cues for auditory spatial processing in the occipital cortex of the blind	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						blindness; auditory spatial processing; spectral cues; functional neuroimaging; PET; crossmodal reorganization; visual cortex plasticity		We have previously shown that some blind individuals can localize sounds more accurately than their sighted counterparts when one ear is obstructed, and that this ability is strongly associated with occipital cortex activity. Given that spectral cues are important for monaurally localizing sounds when one ear is obstructed, and that blind individuals are more sensitive to small spectral differences, we hypothesized that enhanced use of spectral cues via occipital cortex mechanisms could explain the better performance of blind individuals in monaural localization. Using positron-emission tomography (PET), we scanned blind and sighted persons as they discriminated between sounds originating from a single spatial position, but with different spectral profiles that simulated different spatial positions based on head-related transfer functions. We show here that a sub-group of early blind individuals showing superior monaural sound localization abilities performed significantly better than any other group on this spectral discrimination task. For all groups, performance was best for stimuli simulating peripheral positions, consistent with the notion that spectral cues are more helpful for discriminating peripheral sources. PET results showed that all blind groups showed cerebral blood flow increases in the occipital cortex; but this was also the case in the sighted group. A voxel-wise covariation analysis showed that more occipital recruitment was associated with better performance across all blind subjects but not the sighted. An inter-regional covariation analysis showed that the occipital activity in the blind covaried with that of several frontal and parietal regions known for their role in auditory spatial processing. Overall, these results support the notion that the superior ability of a sub-group of early-blind individuals to localize sounds is mediated by their superior ability to use spectral cues, and that this ability is subserved by cortical processing in the occipital cortex.

Its discovery requires allele-specific detection of expressed transcripts, but in some cases detected allelic expression bias has been interpreted as imprinting without demonstrating compatible transmission patterns and excluding heritable variation. Therefore, we utilized a genome-wide tool exploiting high density genotyping arrays in parallel measurements of genotypes in RNA and DNA to determine allelic expression across the transcriptome in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and skin fibroblasts derived from families. Results: We were able to validate 43% of imprinted genes with previous demonstration of compatible transmission patterns in LCLs and fibroblasts. In contrast, we only validated 8% of genes suggested to be imprinted in the literature, but without clear evidence of parent-of-origin-determined expression. We also detected five novel imprinted genes and delineated regions of imprinted expression surrounding annotated imprinted genes. More subtle parent-of-origin-dependent expression, or partial imprinting, could be verified in four genes. Despite higher prevalence of monoallelic expression, immortalized LCLs showed consistent imprinting in fewer loci than primary cells. Random monoallelic expression has previously been observed in LCLs and we show that random monoallelic expression in LCLs can be partly explained by aberrant methylation in the genome. Conclusions: Our results indicate that widespread parent-of-origin-dependent expression observed recently in rodents is unlikely to be captured by assessment of human cells derived from adult tissues where genome-wide assessment of both primary and immortalized cells yields few new imprinted loci.

The Machado-Joseph disease-associated mutant form of ataxin-3 regulates parkin ubiquitination and stability	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							BULBAR MUSCULAR-ATROPHY; LIGASE ACTIVITY; PROTEIN LIGASE; IN-VITRO; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; INTERACTING MOTIF; S-NITROSYLATION; GENE-PRODUCT; MOUSE MODEL; DOMAIN	Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), the most common dominantly inherited ataxia worldwide, is caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme ataxin-3. Interestingly, MJD can present clinically with features of Parkinsonism. In this study, we identify parkin, an E3 ubiquitin-ligase responsible for a common familial form of Parkinson's disease, as a novel ataxin-3 binding partner. The interaction between ataxin-3 and parkin is direct, involves multiple domains and is greatly enhanced by parkin self-ubiquitination. Moreover, ataxin-3 deubiquitinates parkin directly in vitro and in cells. Compared with wildtype ataxin-3, MJD-linked polyQ-expanded mutant ataxin-3 is more active, possibly owing to its greater efficiency at DUB K27- and K29-linked Ub conjugates on parkin. Remarkably, mutant but not wild-type ataxin-3 promotes the clearance of parkin via the autophagy pathway. The finding is consistent with the reduction in parkin levels observed in the brains of transgenic mice over-expressing polyQ-expanded but not wild-type ataxin-3, raising the intriguing possibility that increased turnover of parkin may contribute to the pathogenesis of MJD and help explain some of its parkinsonian features.

The transformation to CaP has been linked to several somatic AR gene mutations and changes in AR protein complex formation, which in turn increase the potential activity of the receptor. Thus, to address the mechanism of AR-mediated neoplastic transformation, we developed in vitro methodology to isolate and characterize, via mass spectrometry, AR complexes of three AR genetic variants: wild type-AR, and two somatic gain-of-function AR prostatic mutants (T877A-AR and 0CAG-AR isoforms). To fully characterize the significance of our large raw data set, we employed a sophisticated systems biology approach to create an integrative protein-interaction network profile for each AR isoform. Our comparative analysis identified subnetwork cluster profiles for AR isoforms (WT, T877A, and 0CAG) that segregated AR isoforms on the basis of androgen stimulation conditions and mutant aggressiveness. Furthermore, results from additional correlative gene microarray analysis studies of all three AR isoform (WT, T877A, 0CAG) subnetwork clusters were assessed and found to be significantly enriched in tumor versus normal prostate tissues. We also identified two AR-interaction clusters, containing 21 and 30 proteins, respectively, that showed unfavourable prognosis outcome of recurrent cancers, on the basis of PSA, Gleason score and combined PSA/Gleason score. In conclusion, we have characterized a large panel of novel AR-interacting proteins, through a combined proteomics/systems biology screen, that are of clinical relevance and could potentially serve as novel markers for diagnosis and prognosis of CaP.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HYPNOSIS			English	Article							PUZZLINGLY HIGH CORRELATIONS; ATTENTIONAL NETWORKS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SOCIAL COGNITION; VISUAL-ACUITY; BRAIN; FMRI; HYPNOSIS; HYPNOTIZABILITY; NEUROSCIENCE	Contemporary studies in the cognitive neuroscience of attention and suggestion shed new light on the underlying neural mechanisms that operationalize these effects. Without adhering to important caveats inherent to imaging of the living human brain, however, findings from brain imaging studies may enthrall more than explain. Scholars, practitioners, professionals, and consumers must realize that the influence words exert on focal brain activity is measurable but that these measurements are often difficult to interpret. While recent brain imaging research increasingly incorporates variations of suggestion and hypnosis, correlating overarching hypnotic experiences with specific brain substrates remains tenuous. This article elucidates the mounting role of cognitive neuroscience, including the relative merits and intrinsic limitations of neuroimaging, in better contextualizing trance-like concepts.

Methods: A multi-centre study similarly to a faux clinical trial has been established to assess longitudinal MRI changes in Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy control subjects using an image acquisition protocol compatible with Alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). Comprehensive quality control (QC) measures have been established throughout the study. An intelligent web-accessible database holds details on both the raw images and data processed using a sophisticated image analysis pipeline. Results: A total of 378 subjects have been recruited (130 AD, 131 MCI, 117 healthy controls) of which a high percentage (97.3%) of the T1-weighted volumes passed the QC criteria. Measurements of normalized whole brain volume and whole brain cortical thickness showed significant differences between AD and controls, AD and MCI and MCI and controls. Conclusions: A framework for multi-centre MRI studies of Alzheimer's disease has been established consisting of a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol across centres, rigorous QC at both the sites and central data analysis hub and an automated image analysis pipeline. Early results demonstrate the high quality of the images acquired and the applicability of the automated image analysis techniques employed. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Presently available methods for this have limitations. This article describes a new method for preparing PEGylated chitosan nanoparticles. For this chitosan was chemoselectively modified using a novel scheme at the C6 position of its repeating units by PEG. The amine groups at the C2 position of the chitosan were protected using phthalic anhydride. Sodium hydride was used to catalyze the etherification reaction between chlorinated chitosan and methyl-PEG, and PEG-grafted chitosan was successfully synthesized. Each step was characterized using C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared. After PEGylation the phthaloylated chitosan was successfully deprotected using hydrazine monohydrate. The synthetic scheme proposed demonstrates a new method for grafting PEG onto chitosan with a moderate degree of substitution. The potential of this polymer in nanoparticle preparation using an ionic gelation method and its gene delivery potentials were investigated by complexing a fluorescently labeled control siRNA. The result showed that suitable nanoparticles can be synthesized using this polymer and that they have capacity to carry genes and provide adequate transfection efficacy with no toxicity when tested in neuronal cells.

It also exhibits great stability and adaptability with regards to noise and pattern degradation and can perform generalization tasks. In particular, the Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) model has shown great promise for pattern recognition for its capacity to be trained using a supervised or unsupervised scheme. This paper describes such a BAM, one that can encode patterns of real and binary values, perform multistep pattern recognition of variable-size time series and accomplish many-to-one associations. Moreover, it will be shown that the BAM can be generalized to multiple associative memories, and that it can be used to store associations from multiple sources as well. The various behaviors are the result of only topological rearrangements, and the same learning and transmission functions are kept constant throughout the models. Therefore, a consistent architecture is used for different tasks, thereby increasing its practical appeal and modeling importance. Simulations show the BAM's various capacities, by using several types of encoding and recall situations.

We investigated the interplay between TGF-beta 1, cerebrovascular function, and cognition using transgenic TGF mice featuring astrocytic TGF-beta 1 overexpression. We further assessed the impact of short, late therapy in elderly animals with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist pioglitazone. The latter was also administered to pups as a prophylactic 1-year treatment. Elderly TGF mice featured cerebrovascular dysfunction that was not remedied with NAC. In contrast, pioglitazone prevented or reversed this deficit, and rescued the impaired neurovascular coupling response to whisker stimulation, although it failed to normalize the vascular structure. In aged TGF mice, neuronal and cognitive indices-the stimulus-evoked neurometabolic response, cortical cholinergic innervation, and spatial memory in the Morris water maze-were intact. Our findings show that impaired brain hemodynamics and cerebrovascular function are not accompanied by memory impairment in this model. Conceivably in AD, they constitute aggravating factors against a background of aging and underlying pathology. Our data further highlight the ability of pioglitazone to protect the cerebrovasculature marked by TGF-beta 1 increase, aging, fibrosis, and antioxidant resistance, thus of high relevance for AD patients.

This study used the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN) waveform component recorded while participants performed a visual short-term memory task to investigate how working memory (WM) storage capacity was affected among athletes who differed according to their history of sports concussions. Fifty-five university-level football players were assigned to three groups: 1-2 concussion athletes; 3+ concussion athletes; non-concussed athletes. The main finding of the present study was that athletes with a history of three concussions or more exhibited significantly attenuated SPCN amplitude relative to both concussed athletes with only one or two prior concussions and athletes without concussions. The latter finding adds to previous evidence of disproportionately worse outcome in athletes presenting with a history of three or more concussions relative to those with fewer concussions. In addition, SPCN amplitude was found to correlate significantly with a visual memory capacity estimate (K), but this K value did not significantly differ across groups. This suggests that attenuated SPCN amplitude after three or more concussions did not interfere with apparent WM function. Taken together, these findings suggest that the altered neurophysiological index of WM storage might be a more sensitive measure of a latent WM function abnormality which may well worsen with aging, or perhaps additional brain insults.

In this study, we examined whether the presence and degree of objective cognitive impairment varied according to the use of published versus local norms. We also varied the cutoff scores at which impairment was recognized and examined whether this altered inclusion in MCI subcategories. We found that the use of different comparison normative groups altered the subcategory diagnoses, especially when the cutoff score for impairment was conservative. In general, local norms were more stringent than published norms. We discuss the implications of these results for MCI diagnosis and categorization.

J	Gagnon, C; Greenwood, CE; Bherer, L				Gagnon, Christine; Greenwood, Carol E.; Bherer, Louis			Glucose regulation is associated with attentional control performances in nondiabetic older adults	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Glucose regulation; Aging; Attentional control	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; TOLERANCE; DYSFUNCTION; DECLINE; MEMORY; WOMEN; AGE	Less efficient glucose regulation, the ability to metabolize glucose, has been associated with poorer cognitive performances in older individuals not meeting criteria for type 2 diabetes (Messier, Tsiakas, Gagnon, & Desrochers, 2010). Yet, the influence of glucose regulation on attentional functions, which are sensitive to aging, is still unclear. The present study examined the relationship between glucose regulation and performances on attentional tasks in nondiabetic older adults. Twenty-two participants (60 years and older) were tested on neuropsychological tests of attention (Trail Making test, modified Stroop test) and on a computerized dual task, after receiving a 50-g glucose drink. Participants with the worse glucose regulation committed more errors on the switching condition of the modified Stroop test (p < .05) and tended to make more errors in divided-attention trials of the computerized dual task (p = .05). Altogether, these results suggest that glucose regulation may transiently influence performances of metabolically healthy older adults on tasks requiring switching attention.

Short- and Long-Term Outcome of Patients with Pseudo-Vitamin D Deficiency Rickets Treated with Calcitriol	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Article							D-DEPENDENT RICKETS; 1-ALPHA-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY; 1,25-DIHYDROXYVITAMIN D-3; BONE DENSITOMETRY; GENE-MUTATIONS; THERAPY; EXPRESSION; CHILDREN; DISEASE; ENZYME	Background: Pseudo-vitamin D deficiency rickets (PDDR; OMIM 264700) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CYP27B1 gene, leading to an inability to synthesize 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (calcitriol). The long-term (>1 yr) effects of calcitriol replacement treatment have not been reported. Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine patients (20 females) with PDDR received calcitriol for periods of 2.0-26 yr. In 21 patients, data were available at diagnosis and during the first 2 yr of treatment with calcitriol. Twenty-five patients had reached their final height at the time of this analysis. Results: The most common presenting features were active rickets, neurological signs, and short stature. Treatment with calcitriol resulted in the normalization of biochemical parameters and mean lumbar spine areal bone mineral density z-scores within 3 months, whereas height z-scores increased more gradually. As to long-term effects, adult patients who had received calcitriol before the pubertal growth spurt (n = 11) had normal height, whereas patients who were treated with calcitriol only after puberty (n = 14) on average were short (height z-score -2.2). Lumbar spine areal bone mineral density z-scores were normal in all patients who had achieved final height. Nine women had 19 pregnancies, which all were without complications. All newborns were eucalcemic at birth. Conclusion: Treatment with calcitriol started in infancy results in short- and long-term correction of all clinical, biochemical, and radiological abnormalities related to PDDR.

However, the detailed changes in skin innervation by the different afferent fiber types following a neuropathic nerve injury have never been characterized in an animal model of neuropathic pain. Our objective was to thoroughly characterize such changes in the thick skin of the foot in a well-established rat model of neuropathic pain, namely, the chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. We used the immunofluorescence detection of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), purinergic receptor P2X3, and NF200 as markers of peptidergic nociceptive fibers, nonpeptidergic nociceptive C fibers, and myelinated afferents, respectively. We observed that CCI-operated animals developed significant mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia as well as thermal hyperalgesia. At 3 days following nerve injury, all CCI-operated animals had a significant decrease in the density of fibers immunoreactive (IR) for CGRP, P2X3, and NF200 within the upper dermis. A recovery of CGRP-IR fibers occurred within 4 weeks of nerve injury and sprouting above control levels was observed at 16 weeks. However, the myelinated (NF200-IR) fibers never recovered to control levels within a period of 16 weeks following nerve injury. Interestingly, the P2X3-IR fibers took considerably more time to recover than the CGRP-IR fibers following the initial loss. A loss in P2X3-IR fibers persisted to 16 weeks and recovered to levels above that of control at 1.5 years following nerve injury. Further studies are required to clarify the relevance of these innervation changes for neuropathic pain generation and maintenance. J. Comp. Neurol. 519:49-63, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Concerns for neurotoxic effects of manganese raises the need for evaluating the efficiency of domestic water treatment systems for removal of this metal. The objective of the present study was to determine whether POU devices are efficient at reducing dissolved manganese concentration in drinking water. Various devices were tested according to the NSF 53 protocol for general metals for high pH test water. Based on these assays, the pour-through filters were identified as the most promising POU devices, with dissolved manganese removal greater than 60% at 100% rated capacity, and greater than 45% at 200% rated capacity (influent Mn approximate to 1,000 g/L). Under-the-sink filters using cationic exchange resins (i.e., water softeners) were also efficient at removing dissolved manganese but over a shorter operating life. Manganese leaching was also observed beyond their rated capacity, making them less robust treatments. The activated carbon block filters and other proprietary technologies were found to be inappropriate for dissolved manganese removal. Further evaluation of POU devices performance should evaluate the impact of hardness on process performance. The impact of particulate Mn should also be evaluated.

We also assessed the performance of residential point-of-use and point-of-entry devices (POE) for reducing manganese concentrations in water. While the total Mn concentrations measured during this study were highly variable depending on the location ( 1 - 2,700 g/L), daily or seasonal variations were minimal. Flushing the tap for 5 minutes did not significantly reduce total manganese concentration for 4 out of 5 sampling locations. The efficiency of reverse osmosis and ion exchange for total Mn removal was consistently high while activated carbon provided variable results. The four POE greensand filters investigated all increased (29 to 199%) manganese concentration, indicating deficient operation and/or maintenance practices. Manganese concentrations in the distribution system were equal or lower than at the inlet, indicating that sampling at the inlet of the distribution system is conservative. The decline in total Mn concentration was linked to higher water residence time in the distribution system.

Membrane-bound FasL can signal in FasL-bearing cells, a process known as reverse signalling. The biological and functional consequences of FasL reverse signalling in Schwann cells were studied. FasL engagement induced the secretion of soluble mediator(s) that stimulated neurite growth in PC12 cells, NGF secretion, and NGF mRNA levels. ERK1/2 and Src phosphorylation was rapidly increased and inhibition of their activation affected NGF synthesis and release. Fast. can therefore act as a signal-transducing molecule in Schwann cells, leading to the secretion of NGF, and may contribute to peripheral nerve regeneration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sequential activation of motor cortical neurons contributes to intralimb coordination during reaching in the cat by modulating muscle synergies. J Neurophysiol 105: 388-409, 2011. First published November 10, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00469.2010. We examined the contribution of the motor cortex to the control of intralimb coordination during reaching in the standing cat. We recorded the activity of 151 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) in the forelimb representation of three cats during a task in which the cat reached forward from a standing position to press a lever. We simultaneously recorded the activity of muscles in the contralateral forelimb acting around each of the major joints. Cell activity was recorded with and without the presence of an obstacle requiring a modification of limb trajectory. The majority of the PTNs (134/151, 89%) modulated their discharge activity at some period of the reach while 84/151 (56%) exhibited a significant peak or trough of activity as the limb was transported from its initial position to the lever. These phasic changes of activity were distributed sequentially throughout the transport phase. A cluster analysis of muscle activity in two of the cats showed the presence of five muscle synergies during this transport period. One of the synergies was related to the lift of the paw from the support surface, two to flexion of the limb and dorsiflexion of the paw, one to preparation for contact with the lever, and one to the transport of the entire limb forward; a sixth synergy was activated during the lever press. An analysis of the phase of cell activity with respect to the phase of activity of muscles selected to represent each of these synergies showed that different populations of PTNs were activated sequentially and coincidentally with each synergy. We suggest that this sequential activation of populations of PTNs is compatible with a contribution to the initiation and modulation of functionally distinct groups of synergistic muscles and ultimately serves to ensure the appropriate multiarticular, intralimb coordination of the limb during reaching.

Removal of spurious correlations between spikes and local field potentials. J Neurophysiol 105: 474-486, 2011. First published November 10, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00642.2010. Single neurons carry out important sensory and motor functions related to the larger networks in which they are embedded. Understanding the relationships between single-neuron spiking and network activity is therefore of great importance and the latter can be readily estimated from low-frequency brain signals known as local field potentials (LFPs). In this work we examine a number of issues related to the estimation of spike and LFP signals. We show that spike trains and individual spikes contain power at the frequencies that are typically thought to be exclusively related to LFPs, such that simple frequency-domain filtering cannot be effectively used to separate the two signals. Ground-truth simulations indicate that the commonly used method of estimating the LFP signal by low-pass filtering the raw voltage signal leads to artifactual correlations between spikes and LFPs and that these correlations exert a powerful influence on popular metrics of spike-LFP synchronization. Similar artifactual results were seen in data obtained from electrophysiological recordings in macaque visual cortex, when low-pass filtering was used to estimate LFP signals. In contrast LFP tuning curves in response to sensory stimuli do not appear to be affected by spike contamination, either in simulations or in real data. To address the issue of spike contamination, we devised a novel Bayesian spike removal algorithm and confirmed its effectiveness in simulations and by applying it to the electrophysiological data. The algorithm, based on a rigorous mathematical framework, outperforms other methods of spike removal on most metrics of spike-LFP correlations. Following application of this spike removal algorithm, many of our electrophysiological recordings continued to exhibit spike-LFP correlations, confirming previous reports that such relationships are a genuine aspect of neuronal activity. Overall, these results show that careful preprocessing is necessary to remove spikes from LFP signals, but that when effective spike removal is used, spike-LFP correlations can potentially yield novel insights about brain function.

Endoscopic treatment of distal choroidal artery aneurysm Case report	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						endoscopic surgery; intraventricular aneurysm; distal anterior choroidal artery; distal lateral posterior choroidal artery; intraventricular hemorrhage	MOYAMOYA-DISEASE	Distal choroidal artery aneurysms stemming from the lateral wall of the ventricles are rare and are mostly associated with moyamoya disease. The treatment of these aneurysms is difficult because of their deep location. The authors report the case of a 50-year-old woman followed for moyamoya disease presenting with 2 intraventricular hemorrhages. Cerebral angiography showed an aneurysm located on the left distal choroidal artery. Magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrated that the lesion protruded from the lateral wall of the trigone of the left lateral ventricle. Using MR imaging guided stereotactic localization, the aneurysm was accurately reached endoscopically and successfully resected from the parent artery. The patient was discharged neurologically intact. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a successfully endoscopically treated distal anterior choroidal artery aneurysm. Endoscopic surgery may be added to the armamentarium of procedures used to treat intraventricular aneurysms.

Design: International, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-label extension. Methods: Approximately 300 adults with a stroke occurring 23 months before screening, presenting with symptoms and signs of an upper motor neuron syndrome and focal spasticity-related functional impairment, were randomized to botulinum toxin A+standard care or placebo+standard care. Study medication was administered at baseline and again at Week 12 if required, with follow-up to 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the number of patients who achieved their investigator-rated principal active functional goal (as measured by Goal Attainment Scaling), at 10 weeks after the second injection (Weeks 22-34) or at the 24-week visit if no second injection was administered. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in level of goal achievement, health-related quality of life and resource utilization. Conclusion: The BOTOX(R) Economic Spasticity Trial (BEST) will provide information regarding clinical and cost-effectiveness of botulinum toxin+standard care vs standard care alone in patients with upper and/or lower limb post-stroke spasticity typically seen in clinical practice.

In the first two experiments, pulse direction identification performance was higher when the remembered direction (FBWM) or the direction of the concurrently attended RDP (FBA) matched the pulse direction than when it was opposite. In Experiment 3, performance was highest when both the remembered and the attended directions matched the pulse direction (combined effects of FBWM and FBA), it was intermediate when only one of them matched the pulse direction, and it was lowest when neither matched the pulse direction. Our results demonstrate that both feature-based working memory and feature-based attention can individually modulate the perception of motion direction and that when acting together they produce an even larger modulation.

Milder forms of MR result from deficient synaptogenesis and/or impaired synaptic plasticity during childhood. These alterations would result from disequilibrium in signalling pathways regulating the balance between long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD) in certain neurons such as hippocampus neurons. To provide mentally retarded children with increased cognitive abilities, novel experimental approaches are currently being developed to characterize signalling status associated with MR and to identify therapeutic targets that would restore lost equilibrium. Several studies also highlighted the major role played by molecular switches like kinases, phosphatases, small G proteins and their regulators in the coordination and integration of signalling pathways associated with synaptic plasticity. These proteins may therefore constitute promising therapeutic targets for a number of cognitive deficiencies.

Disruption of systemic iron homeostasis leads to pathological conditions, ranging from anemias caused by iron deficiency or defective iron traffic, to iron overload (hemochromatosis). Other iron-related disorders are caused by misregulation of cellular iron metabolism, which results in local accumulation of the metal in mitochondria. Brain iron overload is observed in neurodegenerative disorders. Secondary hemochromatosis develops as a complication of another disease. For example, repeated blood transfusions, a standard treatment of various anemias characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, promote transfusional siderosis, while chronic liver diseases are often associated with mild to moderate secondary iron overload. In this critical review, we discuss pathophysiological and clinical aspects of all types of iron metabolism disorders (265 references).

Accumulation of ROS results in oxidative stress, a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). beta-amyloid has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, and its accumulation may lead to degeneration of neuronal or non-neuronal cells. There is evidence that beta-amyloid interacts with mitochondria but little is known concerning the significance of this interaction in the physiopathology of AD. This review explores possible mechanisms of beta-amyloid-induced mitochondrial toxicity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society. All rights reserved.

Rb/E2F Regulates Expression of Neogenin during Neuronal Migration	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							RETINOBLASTOMA TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; CELL-CYCLE CONTROL; CHROMATIN IMMUNOPRECIPITATION; TANGENTIAL MIGRATION; MICROARRAY ANALYSIS; DNA-REPLICATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; EMERGING ROLES; NETRIN-1; GUIDANCE	The Rb/E2F pathway has long been appreciated for its role in regulating cell cycle progression. Emerging evidence indicates that it also influences physiological events beyond regulation of the cell cycle. We have previously described a requirement for Rb/E2F mediating neuronal migration; however, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown, making this an ideal system to identify Rb/E2F-mediated atypical gene regulation in vivo. Here, we report that Rb regulates the expression of neogenin, a gene encoding a receptor involved in cell migration and axon guidance. Rb is capable of repressing E2F-mediated neogenin expression while E2F3 occupies a region containing E2F consensus sites on the neogenin promoter in native chromatin. Absence of Rb results in aberrant neuronal migration and adhesion in response to netrin-1, a known ligand for neogenin. Increased expression of neogenin through ex vivo electroporation results in impaired neuronal migration similar to that detected in forebrain-specific Rb deficiency. These findings show direct regulation of neogenin by the Rb/E2F pathway and demonstrate that regulation of neogenin expression is required for neural precursor migration. These studies identify a novel mechanism through which Rb regulates transcription of a gene beyond the classical E2F targets to regulate events distinct from cell cycle progression.

However, celastrol exhibits low aqueus solubility and a narrow therapeutic index. Herein, we propose the use of nanodelivery systems (e.g. neutral and cationic PAMAM dendrimers and gold nanoparticles) for the efficient solubilisation and delivery of celastrol to microglia. We show significant decreases in inflammatory mediator release (e.g. nitric oxide) and inflammatory signaling (i.e. p38 inhibition) in LPS-stimulated microglia. Furthermore, gold nanorods loaded with celastrol localised to mitochondria in microglia, an important sire of action for celastrol. Results from this study suggest the potential of nanodelivery systems for CNS-targeted anti-inflammatory therapies.

Current ablative therapies (cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation) used in the clinic for the treatment of ROP have limitations and patients can still have long-term effects even after successful treatment. New treatment modalities are still emerging. The most promising are the therapies directed against VEGF; more recently the use of preventive dietary supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid may also be promising. Other than pharmacologic and nutritional approaches, cell-based strategies for vascular repair are likely to arise from advances in regenerative medicine using stem cells. In addition to all of these, a greater understanding of other factors involved in regulating pathologic retinal angiogenesis continues to emerge, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes an update on the current state of knowledge on ROP from our and other laboratories, with particular focus on the role of nitro-oxidative stress and notably trans-arachidonic acids in microvascular degeneration, semaphorin 3 operating as vasorepulsive molecules in the avascular hypoxic retina and in turn impairing revascularization, succinate and its receptor GPR91 in neuron-mediated retinal neovascularization, and omega-3 lipids as modulators of preretinal neovascularization.

In the current paper, I summarize the characteristics that underlie the great diversity of cortical GABAergic interneurons and explore how the multiple roles of these cells in developing and mature circuits might contribute to the aforementioned disorders. Furthermore, I review the tightly controlled genetic cascades that determine the fate of cortical interneurons and summarize how the dysfunction of genes important for the generation, specification, maturation, and function of cortical interneurons might contribute to these disorders.

Because decreased complex-I activity is associated with brain aging, we investigated the expression and distribution of AIF in frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum of aged Long-Evans rat brains. We found that AIF was: (i) more abundantly expressed in striatum than in the other two brain regions, (ii) enriched in deep layers of frontal cortex and in the pyramidal cell layer of hippocampus, and (iii) overall mainly localized to mitochondria, but significantly more translocated to the nucleus in the deep layers of frontal cortex. Altogether, our data point to a difference in regional AIF expression patterns, and provide evidence for the involvement of AIF in the cell death of a subpopulation of cortical neurons in aged animals.

Functional reorganization of the auditory pathways following late callosotomy	NEUROCASE			English	Article						Functional MRI; Corpus callosum; Auditory pathways; Lesion; Brain reorganization; Plasticity	PROFOUND UNILATERAL DEAFNESS; CALLOSAL AGENESIS; BINAURAL STIMULATION; SOUND LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION; CORTEX; SYSTEM; HEMISPHERECTOMY; LATERALIZATION; PLASTICITY	Injuries at various levels of the auditory system have been shown to lead to functional reorganization of the auditory pathways. In particular, it has recently been shown that such reorganization can occur in callosal agenesis. The pattern of cortical activity following callosotomy is however still unknown, but behavioral results suggest that it could be significantly different from that observed in callosal agenesis. We aimed to confirm this hypothesis by investigating fMRI responses to complex sounds presented binaurally and monaurally in a callosotomized patient. In the binaural condition, the callosotomized subject showed patterns of auditory cortical activation that were similar to those of neurologically intact individuals. However, in both monaural conditions, the callosotomized individual showed a significant increase of the asymmetries favoring the contralateral pathways. Such patterns of cortical responses are only partially consistent with the results obtained from callosal agenesis subjects using the exact same procedure. Indeed, the latter show differences compared with normals in both binaural and monaural conditions. These findings provide neurological evidence that callosotomy could lead to distinctive functional reorganization of the human auditory pathways.

We previously reported that, in neuronal cells, beta-amyloid 1-42 (A beta(1-42)) is targeted to mitochondria. We have also reported that, when incubated with isolated rat brain mitochondria, A beta(1-42) inhibits complex IV, uncouples the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and promotes opening of the membrane permeability transition pore. Here, we further analyzed the targeting and mitotoxicity of A beta(1-42). Methods and Results: Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the mitochondrial targeting of A beta(1-42) was concentration-and time-dependent. Incubation of human neuroblastoma cells with A beta(1-42) increased the release of adenylate kinase, a mitochondrial enzyme released after membrane permeability transition pore opening. However, it failed to trigger DNA fragmentation and apoptosis, suggesting that the ability of this peptide to uncouple the respiratory chain underlies its mitotoxicity and cytotoxicity. A beta(1-42) targeting to mitochondria was blocked by caprospinol, a steroid derivative shown to protect neuronal cells against A beta(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity. Further experiments revealed that the mitotoxic effect of A beta(1-42) is specific to its primary amino acid sequence and suggested that it may be also related to its tertiary structure. Importantly, the mitotoxic effect of A beta(1-42) was not restricted to brain cells, indicating that it is not cell-or tissue-specific. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular A beta(1-42) targets neuronal mitochondria to exert its toxic effects. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

In the neuroimaging literature, the MNI305 Talairach-like coordinate system is often used as a standard template. However, when studying pediatric populations, variation from the adult brain makes the MNI305 suboptimal for processing brain images of children. Morphological changes occurring during development render the use of age-appropriate templates desirable to reduce potential errors and minimize bias during processing of pediatric data. This paper presents the methods used to create unbiased, age-appropriate MRI atlas templates for pediatric studies that represent the average anatomy for the age range of 4.5-18.5 years, while maintaining a high level of anatomical detail and contrast. The creation of anatomical T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted templates for specific developmentally important age-ranges, used data derived from the largest epidemiological, representative (healthy and normal) sample of the U.S. population, where each subject was carefully screened for medical and psychiatric factors and characterized using established neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. Use of these age-specific templates was evaluated by computing average tissue maps for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid for each specific age range, and by conducting an exemplar voxel-wise deformation-based morphometry study using 66 young (4.5-6.9 years) participants to demonstrate the benefits of using the age-appropriate templates. The public availability of these atlases/templates will facilitate analysis of pediatric MRI data and enable comparison of results between studies in a common standardized space specific to pediatric research.

Six amblyopes participated in this study. Standard retinotopic mapping stimuli were used to define the boundaries of early visual cortical areas. We obtained fMRI time series from thalamic, striate and extrastriate cortical regions for the connectivity study. Thalamo-striate and striate-extrastriate networks were constructed based on known anatomical connections and the effective connectivities of these networks were assessed by means of a nonlinear system identification method. The effective connectivity of all networks studied was reduced when driven by the amblyopic eye, suggesting contrary to the current single-cell model of localized signal reduction, that a significant part of the amblyopic deficit is due to anomalous interactions between cells in disparate brain regions. The effective connectivity loss was unrelated to the fMRI loss but correlated with the degree of amblyopia (ipsilateral LGN to V1 connection), suggesting that it may be a more relevant measure. Feedforward and feedback connectivities were similarly affected. A hemispheric dependence was found for the thalamo-striate feedforward input that was not present for the feedback connection, suggesting that the reduced function of the LGN recently found in amblyopic humans may not be solely determined by the feedback influence from the cortex. Both ventral and dorsal connectivities were reduced. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Thus, cognitive rehabilitation could capitalise upon preserved episodic memory and focus on everyday activities which, once learned, will have an impact in everyday life. This pilot study thus explores the effectiveness of an ecological approach in one patient suffering from SD. EC, a 68-year-old woman with SD, stopped cooking complex meals due to a substantial loss of knowledge related to all food types. The therapy consisted of preparing a target recipe. She was asked to generate semantic attributes of ingredients found in one target, one control and two no-therapy recipes. The number of recipes cooked by EC between therapy sessions was computed. She was also asked to prepare a generalisation recipe combining ingredients from the target and control recipes. EC's generated semantic attributes (GSA) of ingredients pertaining to the target and control recipes increased significantly (p < .001), compared to the no-therapy recipes (ps > .79). The proportion of meals cooked also increased significantly (p = .021). For the generalisation recipe, she could not succeed without assistance. Frequent food preparation may have provided EC with new memories about the context, usage and appearance of some concepts. These memories seem very context-bound, but EC nonetheless re-introduced some recipes into her day-to-day life. The impact of these results on the relationship between semantic, episodic and procedural memory is discussed, as well as the relevance of an ecological approach in SD.

The first part of this article reviews brain stimulation studies related to language recovery in aphasic patients. The second part reports results from a pilot study with three chronic stroke patients who had non-fluent aphasia, where real or placebo rTMS was immediately followed by 25 minutes of individualised speech therapy. Real rTMS consisted of high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 8/9) for 25 minutes. Each patient underwent a total of four weeks of intervention. P1 underwent four weeks of real rTMS (5 days/week) where individualised speech therapy was provided for 25 minutes immediately following each rTMS session. P2 and P3 each underwent two weeks of placebo rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy; then two weeks of real rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy. Assessments took place at 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks post-entry/baseline testing. Relative to entry/baseline testing, a significant improvement in object naming was observed at all testing times, from two weeks post-intervention in real rTMS plus speech therapy, or placebo rTMS plus speech therapy. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of targeted behavioural training in combination with brain stimulation in chronic aphasic patients. However, further work is required in order to verify whether optimal combination parameters (rTMS alone or speech therapy alone) and length of rTMS treatment may be found.

In the present study, a PM rehabilitation programme based on visual imagery techniques expected to strengthen the cue-action association was developed. Ten moderate to severe chronic TBI patients learned to create a mental image representing the association between a prospective cue and an intended action within progressively more complex and naturalistic PM tasks. We hypothesised that compared to TBI patients (n = 20) who received a short session of education (control condition), TBI patients in the rehabilitation group would exhibit a greater improvement on the event-based than on the time-based condition of a PM ecological task. Results revealed however that this programme was similarly beneficial for both conditions. TBI patients in the rehabilitation group and their relatives also reported less everyday PM failures following the programme, which suggests generalisation. The PM improvement appears to be specific since results on cognitive control tasks remained similar. Therefore, visual imagery techniques appear to improve PM functioning by strengthening the memory trace of the intentions and inducing an automatic recall of the intentions.

J	Lane, AK; Benoit, D				Lane, Amy K.; Benoit, Dana			Driving, brain injury and assistive technology	NEUROREHABILITATION			English	Article						Driving; brain injury; assistive technology	BEHAVIOR; INDIVIDUALS; SIMULATOR; CRASHES; ISSUES; RISK	Individuals with brain injury often present with cognitive, physical and emotional impairments which impact their ability to resume independence in activities of daily living. Of those activities, the resumption of driving privileges is cited as one of the greatest concerns by survivors of brain injury. The integration of driving fundamentals within the hierarchical model proposed by Keskinen represents the complexity of skills and behaviors necessary for driving. This paper provides a brief review of specific considerations concerning the driver with TBI and highlights current vehicle technology which has been developed by the automotive industry and by manufacturers of adaptive driving equipment that may facilitate the driving task. Adaptive equipment technology allows for compensation of a variety of operational deficits, whereas technological advances within the automotive industry provide drivers with improved safety and information systems. However, research has not yet supported the use of such intelligent transportation systems or advanced driving systems for drivers with brain injury. Although technologies are intended to improve the safety of drivers within the general population, the potential of negative consequences for drivers with brain injury must be considered. Ultimately, a comprehensive driving evaluation and training by a driving rehabilitation specialist is recommended for individuals with brain injury. An understanding of the potential impact of TBI on driving-related skills and knowledge of current adaptive equipment and technology is imperative to determine whether return-to-driving is a realistic and achievable goal for the individual with TBI.

Materials and Methods: Twenty- four female Sprague- Dawley rats underwent bilateral pudendal nerve section to induce SUI. Six rats were SUI controls, 6 received periurethral injection of Plasma- Lyte (SUI placebo control) and 12 were given periurethral injection of PKH26- labeled MSCs. Four weeks after injection, conscious cystometry was undertaken in animals and VLPP recorded. All groups were sacrificed, and frozen urethra sections were submitted to pathology and immunohistochemistry assessment. Results: Rat MSCs were positive for the cell surface antigens CD44, CD73, CD90, and RT1A, and negative for CD31, CD45, and RT1B, confirming their stem cell phenotype. In vitro, differentiated MSCs expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and desmin, markers of smooth and striated muscles in vivo. Immunohistochemistry of rat urethras revealed PKH26-labeled MSCs in situ and at the injection site. LPP was significantly improved in animals injected with MSCs. Mean LPP was 24.28 +/- 1.47 cmH2O in rats implanted with MSCs and 16.21 +/- 1.26 cmH2O in SUI controls (P < 0.001). Atrophic urethras with implanted MSCs were positively stained for myosin heavy chain and desmin. Conclusion: Rat MSCs have the ability to differentiate and skew their phenotype towards smooth and striated muscles, as demonstrated by SMA up- regulation and desmin expression. Periurethral injection of MSCs in an animal model of SUI restored the damaged external urethral sphincter and significantly improved VLPP. Neurourol. Urodynam. 30: 447- 455, 2011.

J	Dumoulin, C; Glazener, C; Jenkinson, D				Dumoulin, Chantale; Glazener, Cathryn; Jenkinson, David			Determining the Optimal Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Regimen for Women with Stress Urinary Incontinence	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Article						pelvic floor muscle training; stress urinary incontinence; women	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NO ACTIVE TREATMENT; DYNAMOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; VAGINAL CONES; SINGLE-BLIND; EXERCISE; MUSCULATURE; BIOFEEDBACK; MANAGEMENT	Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training has received Level-A evidence rating in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women, based on meta-analysis of numerous randomized control trials (RCTs) and is recommended in many published guidelines. However, the actual regimen of PFM training used varies widely in these RCTs. Hence, to date, the optimal PFM training regimen for achieving continence remains unknown and the following questions persist: how often should women attend PFM training sessions and how many contractions should they perform for maximal effect? Is a regimen of strengthening exercises better than a motor control strategy or functional retraining? Is it better to administer a PFM training regimen to an individual or are group sessions equally effective, or better? Which is better, PFM training by itself or in combination with biofeedback, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and/or vaginal cones? Should we use improvement or cure as the ultimate outcome to determine which regimen is the best? The questions are endless. As a starting point in our endeavour to identify optimal PFM training regimens, the aim of this study is (a) to review the present evidence in terms of the effectiveness of different PFM training regimens in women with SUI and (b) to discuss the current literature on PFM dysfunction in SUI women, including the up-to-date evidence on skeletal muscle training theory and other factors known to impact on women's participation in and adherence to PFM training.

As coccyx movement produced during pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contractions may affect other measures, optimal placement of the posterior point is important. This study compared two methods for measuring the PCL, with different posterior points, on T2-weighted sagittal MRI to determine the effect of coccygeal movement on measures of pelvic organ support in older women. Methods: MRI of the pelvis was performed in the midsagittal plane, at rest and during PFM contractions, on 47 community-dwelling women 60 and over. The first PCL was measured to the tip of the coccyx (PCLtip) and the second to the sacrococcygeal joint (PCLjnt). Four measures of pelvic organ support were made using each PCL as the reference line: urethrovesical junction height, uterovaginal junction height, Mline and levator plate angle. Results: During the PFM contraction the PCLtip shortened and lifted (P < 0.001); the PCLjnt did not change (P > 0.05). The changes in the four measures of pelvic organ support were smaller when measured relative to the PCLtip as compared to those to the PCLjnt (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Coccyx movement affected the length and position of the PCLtip, which resulted in underestimates of the pelvic-organ lift produced by the PFM contraction. Therefore, we recommend that the PCL be measured to the sacrococcygeal joint and not to the tip of the coccyx. Neurourol. Urodynam. 30:1613-1619, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Grant, JA; Courtemanche, J; Rainville, P				Grant, Joshua A.; Courtemanche, Jerome; Rainville, Pierre			A non-elaborative mental stance and decoupling of executive and pain-related cortices predicts low pain sensitivity in Zen meditators	PAIN			English	Article						Pain; Meditation; fMRI; Emotion; Attention; Mindfulness	LONG-TERM MEDITATION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; DEFAULT MODE; PRACTITIONERS; PERCEPTION; THICKNESS; AWARENESS	Concepts originating from ancient Eastern texts are now being explored scientifically, leading to new insights into mind/brain function. Meditative practice, often viewed as an emotion regulation strategy, has been associated with pain reduction, low pain sensitivity, chronic pain improvement, and thickness of pain-related cortices. Zen meditation is unlike previously studied emotion regulation techniques; more akin to 'no appraisal' than 'reappraisal'. This implies the cognitive evaluation of pain may be involved in the pain-related effects observed in meditators. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a thermal pain paradigm we show that practitioners of Zen, compared to controls, reduce activity in executive, evaluative and emotion areas during pain (prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus). Meditators with the most experience showed the largest activation reductions. Simultaneously, meditators more robustly activated primary pain processing regions (anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, insula). Importantly, the lower pain sensitivity in meditators was strongly predicted by reductions in functional connectivity between executive and pain-related cortices. Results suggest a functional decoupling of the cognitive-evaluative and sensory-discriminative dimensions of pain, possibly allowing practitioners to view painful stimuli more neutrally. The activation pattern is remarkably consistent with the mindset described in Zen and the notion of mindfulness. Our findings contrast and challenge current concepts of pain and emotion regulation and cognitive control; commonly thought to manifest through increased activation of frontal executive areas. We suggest it is possible to self-regulate in a more 'passive' manner, by reducing higher-order evaluative processes, as demonstrated here by the disengagement of anterior brain systems in meditators.

Although the clinical effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease is established, there has been less examination of its social aspects. Methods and Results. Building on qualitative comments provided by healthcare providers, we present four different social and relational issues (need for social support, changes in relationships (with self and partner) and challenges with regards to occupation and the social system). We review the literature from multiple disciplines on each issue. We comment on their ethical implications and conclude by establishing the future prospects for research with the possible expansion of DBS for psychiatric indications. Conclusions. Our review demonstrates that there are varied social issues involved in DBS. These issues may have significant impacts on the perceived outcome of DBS by patients. Moreover, the fact that the social impact of DBS is still not well understood in emerging psychiatric indications presents an important area for future examination.

J	MacDonald, PA; Monchi, O				MacDonald, Penny A.; Monchi, Oury			Differential Effects of Dopaminergic Therapies on Dorsal and Ventral Striatum in Parkinson's Disease: Implications for Cognitive Function	PARKINSONS DISEASE			English	Review								Cognitive abnormalities are a feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Unlike motor symptoms that are clearly improved by dopaminergic therapy, the effect of dopamine replacement on cognition seems paradoxical. Some cognitive functions are improved whereas others are unaltered or even hindered. Our aim was to understand the effect of dopamine replacement therapy on various aspects of cognition. Whereas dorsal striatum receives dopamine input from the substantia nigra (SN), ventral striatum is innervated by dopamine-producing cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In PD, degeneration of SN is substantially greater than cell loss in VTA and hence dopamine-deficiency is significantly greater in dorsal compared to ventral striatum. We suggest that dopamine supplementation improves functions mediated by dorsal striatum and impairs, or heightens to a pathological degree, operations ascribed to ventral striatum. We consider the extant literature in light of this principle. We also survey the effect of dopamine replacement on functional neuroimaging in PD relating the findings to this framework. This paper highlights the fact that currently, titration of therapy in PD is geared to optimizing dorsal striatum-mediated motor symptoms, at the expense of ventral striatum operations. Increased awareness of contrasting effects of dopamine replacement on dorsal versus ventral striatum functions will lead clinicians to survey a broader range of symptoms in determining optimal therapy, taking into account both those aspects of cognition that will be helped versus those that will be hindered by dopaminergic treatment.

The incidence of noninfectious transfusion reactions is greater than that of infectious complications. Furthermore, the mortality associated with noninfectious risks is significantly higher. In fact, noninfectious risks account for 87-100% of fatal complications of transfusions. It is concerning to note that the majority of pediatric reports relate to human error such as overtransfusion and lack of knowledge of special requirements in the neonatal age group. The second most frequent category is acute transfusion reactions, majority of which are allergic in nature. It is estimated that the incidence of adverse outcome is 18:100 000 red blood cells issued for children aged less than 18 years and 37:100 000 for infants. The comparable adult incidence is 13:100 000. In order to decrease the risks associated with transfusion of blood products, various blood-conservation strategies can be utilized. Modalities such as acute normovolemic hemodilution, hypervolemic hemodilution, deliberate hypotension, antifibrinolytics, intraoperative blood salvage, and autologous blood donation are discussed and the pediatric literature is reviewed. A discussion of transfusion triggers, and algorithms as well as current research into alternatives to blood transfusions concludes this review.

Treatment-Related Morbidity in Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor: Multifocal Necrotizing Leukoencephalopathy	PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor; Chemotherapy; Radiation therapy; Late effects of cancer therapy; Multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MALIGNANT RHABDOID TUMOR; CHILDREN; CHEMOTHERAPY; CHILDHOOD; INFANCY; COMPLICATION; LEUKEMIA; THERAPY; BRAIN	Background: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is an aggressive malignant brain tumor that, since it was first identified, has been treated with aggressive treatment regimens, e. g. high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue and early radiotherapy. We reviewed our experience because of concerns with respect to treatment-related toxicity in our patients. Methods: Seven patients with a median age at presentation of 18 months were diagnosed with AT/RT between 1996 and 2006. Tumor location was supratentorial in 2 patients, in the posterior fossa in 4 and spinal in 1. Gross total resection was performed in 1 patient, subtotal resection in 5 and biopsy only in 1. Adjuvant treatment consisted of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 5 patients. Results: Median progression-free survival was 4 months, and median overall survival was 7 months. Two children are alive at 44 and 102 months. Significant surgical and chemotherapy-related morbidity was seen. Biopsy-proven multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (MNL) was seen in one patient who is alive 44 months after diagnosis. Another patient who was thought to have recurrent tumor in the brainstem 9 months after diagnosis had imaging findings compatible with MNL. Conclusion: Although improving results are reported for AT/RT using intensive treatment regimens, treatment-related morbidity is considerable in this young patient population. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

Methods: A search of 12 electronic databases identified all relevant studies. For each study, the quality of the methods was assessed according to the study design. A total of 33 articles were retrieved, and 21 studies were included in the final analysis. Results: Feeding interventions were separated into five main categories: oral sensorimotor facilitation, food consistency, positioning, oral appliances, and adaptive equipment. Five studies were randomized controlled trials. Outcomes were mainly reported on feeding safety and efficiency. One study documented positive results in height and weight change. Nineteen of the 21 studies presented positive outcomes in eating efficiency and/or safety. Interpretation: Feeding interventions demonstrate potential benefits for children with cerebral palsy. However, the current level of evidence is poor, and empirical data are lacking. Methodologically, rigorous studies are required particularly investigating multimodal approaches.

The ability of LAD to generate interpretable patterns serves to reinforce the theoretical knowledge or to uncover new knowledge about a certain diagnostic problem in CBM. This paper discusses three scenarios where LAD has been used as a classification tool for fault diagnosis in CBM. In each of these scenarios expert knowledge is elicited in different forms and used in the diagnostic decision. The paper describes the advantages of using LAD for fault diagnosis in each of these three scenarios and concludes that the combination of LAD with expert elicitation permits the use of the former in an unsupervised environment.

One explanation of NMA [sensory accumulation model (SAM), Aschersleben in Brain Cogn 48: 66-79, 2002] is that more time is needed to generate a central code for kinesthetic-tactile information than for auditory or visual stimuli. The SAM predicts that raising the intensity of the pacing stimuli shortens the time for their sensory accumulation, thereby increasing NMA. This prediction was tested by asking participants to synchronize finger force pulses with target isochronous stimuli with various intensities. In addition, participants performed a simple reaction-time task, for comparison. Higher intensity led to shorter reaction times. However, intensity manipulation did not affect NMA in the synchronization task. This finding is not consistent with the predictions based on the SAM. Discrepancies in sensitivity to stimulus intensity between sensorimotor synchronization and reaction-time tasks point to the involvement of different timing mechanisms in these two tasks.

While task-set switching is known to be detrimental to behavioral performance, less is known about the precise loci of these effects on stimulus processing. We measured event-related potentials to explore the neural consequences of task-set switching on semantic processing. We examined the context-sensitive N400 component evoked by the second of two target words embedded in a rapid serial visual presentation under conditions that involved either a task-set switch or no switching. Whereas the N400 was unaffected by the lag separating the targets in the absence of switching, it was delayed and attenuated in the switch condition when the targets were adjacent in the sequence. These findings indicate that task-set reconfiguration temporarily prevents semantic activation and provide evidence for the nonautomaticity of semantic processing of words.

Effect of an intervention to improve the management of patients with diabetes in primary care practice	SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							BLOOD-GLUCOSE CONTROL; PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE; SAUDI-ARABIA; COMPLICATIONS; MELLITUS; OUTPATIENT; GUIDELINES; PHYSICIANS; ADHERENCE; QUALITY	Objectives: To assess the effect of an intervention targeted at primary care physicians (PCPs) in order to improve their management of diabetic patients. Methods: Diabetic patients seen by PCPs in King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from January 2008 to July 2009 were included in this prospective cohort study. The PCPs were divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group with the help of an assistant, utilized a customized designed computer program generating a checklist for the PCPs. The list included clinical and biochemical screening tests needed for the patient's current visit, according to evidence-based diabetes guidelines. For the control group, no assistant was used. At the end of one year, an independent reviewer evaluated the patients' files in both groups to assess the adherence to diabetes guidelines. Results: We enrolled 162 patients in the control group and 517 patients in the intervention group. The intervention significantly improved the percentage of patients being screened for diabetic complications; retinopathy from 24.7-98.5%, neuropathy from 25.9-92%, and nephropathy from 37.8-73.7%. There was no improvement in glycemic control in both groups and glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c) values were still above the 7% target. Conclusion: Management of diabetic patients in the primary care clinics is below standard. The intervention applied was effective in promoting better adherence to evidence-based diabetes guidelines.

It has been suggested that this may be mediated through toxic effects of psychosis on the structure and function of the brain. Equivocal evidence exists regarding association between longer DUP and neuro-anatomical changes such as, reduced grey matter volume in specific regions in the brain and deficits in neurocognitive functions. Objective: To examine if duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) preceding treatment of a first episode of psychosis is associated with structural brain abnormalities and deficits in neurocognitive functions. Method: We investigated the relationship between DUP and grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry techniques and with multiple domains of cognition. Eighty patients with a first episode of psychosis were separated into two equal sized groups based on a median split (18 weeks) of their DUP. Results: Compared to the short-DUP group (mean DUP 7.9 weeks +/- 5.6), the long-DUP group (mean 113.7 weeks +/- 170.4) showed significant grey matter volume reductions in orbital-frontal regions (bilateral medial frontal gyms and bilateral rectal gyms, BA 11) and parietal regions (postcentral gyms and superior parietal lobule) as well as a significant reduction in whole brain grey matter volume (p < 0.04). For schizophrenia spectrum cases only these findings were confined to left rectal gyms. There were no differences in white matter or cerebral spinal fluid volumes or on cognitive functions. Results are controlled for antipsychotic medication exposure. Limitations: The inherent difficulty in separating slow and insidious onset from long-DUP may limit the interpretation of our results and there may be an overlap between DUP and duration of illness (including the prodrome). Conclusion: Patients with a longer delay in treatment of psychosis show a significant reduction in overall grey matter volume with specific reductions in the inferior-orbital region. These results provide some support to a possible neurotoxic effect of prolonged untreated psychosis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Continuity of Resetting a Pacemaker in an Excitable Medium	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						phase resetting; excitable systems; pacemaker; basin of attraction; continuation method; traveling wave	CARDIAC TISSUE; PROPAGATION; REFLECTION; WAVES; DISCONTINUITIES; TERMINATION; EXCITATION; RESISTANCE; CONDUCTION; ISOCHRONS	Pacemakers in excitable media generate waves that propagate outward from the pacemaker. Such waves of excitation are well known in biological and chemical systems such as nerves, the heart, and the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Stimuli delivered at a distant site from the pacemaker can reset the pacemaker, leading to a change in the timing of the pacemaker. The relation between stimulus timing and resultant resetting of the pacemaker is captured by phase resetting curves. The continuity of resetting curves has been investigated in both experiments and numerical models. We present theoretical results discussing conditions for continuity of resetting curves as the amplitude and phase of the stimulus varies. We also use continuation and shooting methods to analyze the continuity of resetting curves in simple mathematical models of cardiac and neural activity. Under continuous changes of stimulus parameters, resetting curves will be continuous unless a stimulus leads to dynamics that fall outside the basin of attraction of the pacemaker-driven excitable medium.

Contrasting roles for lateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in transient and dispositional affective experience	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mood; emotion; emotion regulation; lesion; prefrontal cortex	NEGATIVE EMOTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RECOGNITION; DEPRESSION; MODULATION; SADNESS; DAMAGE; MOOD	Prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated in the experience and regulation of emotional states. Emotional experience is a complex construct, encompassing a range of more specific processes. This exploratory study aimed to delineate which (if any) aspects of emotional experience rely critically on either the ventromedial frontal (VMF) or lateral frontal (LF) lobes. The affective experience of individuals with damage to these regions was surveyed in detail using several measures and compared with that of control participants. Dependent measures included subjective and observer ratings of both dispositional affect and transient responses to laboratory mood inductions. VMF damage was associated with greater negative dispositional affect relative to controls and to individuals with LF damage; however, transient responses to emotional stimuli were largely normal. In contrast, LF damage was associated with an exaggerated subjective reactivity to sad emotional stimuli relative to control participants, but normal dispositional affect. Interestingly, neither form of PFC damage affected spontaneous emotion recovery following the mood inductions. These findings suggest a role for VMF in modulating dispositional negative affect; in contrast, LF areas appear to be critical in regulating transient emotional responses while emotional stimuli are present. This study also illustrates the dissociability of different aspects of emotional experience in patients with focal brain injury.

Traditionally the role of parental behavior for qualitative differences in early attachment relationships has been emphasized. However, disrupted infant-parent interactions only partly explain attachment disorganization. A complementary focus on child factors such as early differences in the underlying neurobiological systems is needed. We examined whether early structural differences in the gangliothalamic ovoid, comprising the basal ganglia and the thalamus, are involved in the etiology of infant attachment disorganization. Gangliothalamic ovoid diameter was measured by ultrasound in 6-week-old participants of a prospective population-based cohort study. Attachment classification of 629 of these infants was assessed with the strange situation at 14 months of age. Neurobiological differences within the normal range were prospectively associated with attachment disorganization. Infants with a larger gangliothalamic ovoid at 6 weeks had a lower risk of attachment disorganization at 14 months (OR = 0.73 per SD increase in diameter, 95% CI 0.57-0.93, p < .05). Volume of the lateral ventricles as an index of general brain development was not associated with attachment disorganization. These findings provide new insight into the etiology of infant attachment disorganization that may in part be neurodevelopmentally determined.

Normal people refrain from engaging in such behaviors because they tie together the moral value of society and the risk of punishment when they violate social rules. What is it, then, that allows these immoral individuals to behave in this manner, and in some situations even to prosper? When there is a dysfunction of somatic markers, specific disadvantageous impairments in decision-making arise, as in moral judgment, but, paradoxically, under some circumstances, the damage can cause the patient to make optimal financial investment decisions. Interestingly, individuals with psychopathy, a personality disorder, share many of the same behavioral characteristics seen in VMPFC and amygdala lesion patients, suggesting that defective somatic markers may serve as a neural framework for explaining immoral and corrupt behaviors. While these sociopathic behaviors of sometimes famous and powerful individuals have long been discussed, primarily within the realm of social science and psychology, here we offer a neurocognitive perspective on the possible neural roots of immoral and corrupt behaviors.

Independent spinal cord atrophy measures correlate to motor and sensory deficits in individuals with spinal cord injury	SPINAL CORD			English	Article						SCI; MRI; clinical outcome; atrophy	MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MRI; DISABILITY; FIBERS	Study design: Cross-sectional descriptive analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical outcome. Objectives: The aim of this study was to present anatomically consistent and independent spinal cord atrophy measures based on standard MRI material and analyze their specific relations to sensory and motor outcome in individuals with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting: Danish study on human SCI. Methods: We included 19 individuals with chronic incomplete SCI and 16 healthy controls. Participants underwent MRI and a neurological examination including sensory testing for light touch and pinprick, and muscle strength. Antero-posterior width (APW), left-right width (LRW) and cross-sectional spinal cord area (SCA) were extracted from MRI at the spinal level of C2. The angular variation of the spinal cord radius over the full circle was also extracted and compared with the clinical scores. Results: The motor score was correlated to LRW and the sensory scores were correlated to APW. The scores correlated also well with decreases in spinal cord radius in oblique angles in coherent and non-overlapping sectors for the sensory and motor qualities respectively. Conclusion: APW and LRW can be used to assess sensory and motor function independently. The finding is corresponding well with the respective locations of the main sensory and motor pathways.

The basis for this prohibition can be found in the World Anti-Doping Code, which defines the three criteria used to consider banning a substance. In this context, we discuss the potential of cannabis to enhance sports performance, the risk it poses to the athlete's health and its violation of the spirit of sport. Although these compounds are prohibited in-competition only, we explain why the pharmacokinetics of their main psychoactive compound, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, may complicate the results management of adverse analytical findings. Passive inhalation does not appear to be a plausible explanation for a positive test. Although the prohibition of cannabinoids in sports is one of the most controversial issues in anti-doping, in this review we stress the reasons behind this prohibition, with strong emphasis on the evolving knowledge of cannabinoid pharmacology.

The first seven proteinases cleave proproteins at single or pairs of basic residues in the Golgi, secretory granules, cell surface, or endosomes. These comprise neural and endocrine hormones and their release/inhibiting factors, growth factors and their receptors, and adhesion molecules. The regulated neural and endocrine PC1/3 and PC2 generate multiple peptide hormones and neuropeptides, including the family of hypothalamic-releasing/inhibiting factors. The ubiquitously expressed furin is the principal PC that processes constitutively secreted proteins. PC4 controls testicular and ovarian physiology. PC5/6 and PACE4 bind heparin sulfate proteoglycans and play critical roles during development by regulating body axis and polarity determinants. PC7 exerts unique functions in the brain. The members SKI-1/S1P and PCSK9 do not require a basic residue at the cleavage site and play major roles in the regulation of cholesterol/lipid homeostasis. In vivo studies demonstrated that PCs play major roles in health and disease states.

Perceptually, patients often report distortions of visual space which can be partially explained by perceptual filling-in. The mechanisms involved could also apply to peripheral field loss. Spatial interval discrimination was tested in 28 retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients and a control group. When stimuli were presented to both hemispheres, bias did not differ whereas threshold was poorer in RP patients. When presenting the task to only one hemifield, bias was related to field asymmetry, but only in the left visual field, r(2)= .59. Brain laterality may be an important factor when examining changes in cortical function in response to peripheral system damage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cerebral Embolism Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						aortic stenosis; cerebral embolism; magnetic resonance imaging; percutaneous valve	LEFT-HEART CATHETERIZATION; TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER DETECTION; CORONARY-ARTERY; CARDIAC-CATHETERIZATION; ATHEROSCLEROTIC DEBRIS; BRAIN-INJURY; STENOSIS; MICROEMBOLI; RISK; IMPACT	Objectives The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of cerebral embolism (CE) as evaluated by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) following transapical (TA) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) versus transfemoral (TF) TAVI. Background The TA-TAVI approach avoids both the manipulation of large catheters in the aortic arch/ascending aorta and the retrograde crossing of the aortic valve, and this avoidance might lead to a lower rate of CE. Methods This was a prospective multicenter study including 60 patients who underwent cerebral DW-MRI the day before and within the 6 days following TAVI (TF approach: 29 patients; TA approach: 31 patients). Neurologic and cognitive function assessments were performed at DW-MRI time points. Results The TAVI procedure was performed with the Edwards valve and was successful in all cases but one (98%). A total of 41 patients (68%) had 251 new cerebral ischemic lesions at the DW-MRI performed 4 +/- 1 days after the procedure, 19 patients in the TF group (66%) and 22 patients in the TA group (71%; p = 0.78). Most patients (76%) with new ischemic lesions had multiple lesions (median number of lesions per patient: 3, range 1 to 31). There were no differences in lesion number and size between the TF and TA groups. No baseline or procedural factors were found to be predictors of new ischemic lesions. The occurrence of CE was not associated with a measurable impairment in cognitive function, but 2 patients (3.3%) had a clinically apparent stroke within the 24 h following the procedure (1 patient in each group). Conclusions TAVI is associated with a high rate of silent cerebral ischemic lesions as evaluated by DW-MRI, with no differences between the TF and TA approaches. These results provide important novel insight into the mechanisms of CE associated with TAVI and support the need for further research to both reduce the incidence of CE during these procedures and better determine their clinical relevance.

The issue has three main goals. First, we aimed to bring together theoreticians to contribute to the development of models providing adaptive explanations for animal personality that could guide empiricists, and stimulate exchange of ideas between the two groups of researchers. Second, we aimed to stimulate cross-fertilization between different scientific fields that study personality, namely behavioural ecology, psychology, genomics, quantitative genetics, neuroendocrinology and developmental biology. Third, we aimed to foster the application of an evolutionary framework to the study of personality.

Perinatal Asphyxia Affects Rat Auditory Processing: Implications for Auditory Perceptual Impairments in Neurodevelopmental Disorders	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CEREBRAL-PALSY; CORTEX NEURONS; BRAIN-STEM; AUTISM; INHIBITION; SYSTEM; BIRTH; ORGANIZATION; MONKEYS; CONSEQUENCES	Perinatal asphyxia, a naturally and commonly occurring risk factor in birthing, represents one of the major causes of neonatal encephalopathy with long term consequences for infants. Here, degraded spectral and temporal responses to sounds were recorded from neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of adult rats exposed to asphyxia at birth. Response onset latencies and durations were increased. Response amplitudes were reduced. Tuning curves were broader. Degraded successive-stimulus masking inhibitory mechanisms were associated with a reduced capability of neurons to follow higher-rate repetitive stimuli. The architecture of peripheral inner ear sensory epithelium was preserved, suggesting that recorded abnormalities can be of central origin. Some implications of these findings for the genesis of language perception deficits or for impaired language expression recorded in developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, contributed to by perinatal asphyxia, are discussed.

Here we show first that these cells are hyperpolarized when external sodium is lowered, suggesting that non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) could be involved. As canonical transient receptor channels (TRPCs) are known to form NSCCs, we looked for TRPCs subunits using single-cell RT-PCR and found that TRPC6 mRNA was detectable in a small minority, TRPC1, TRPC3 and TRPC7 in a majority and TRPC4 and 5 in the vast majority (similar to 90%) of hcrt/orx neurons. Using intracellular applications of TRPC antibodies against subunits known to form NSCCs, we then found that only TRPC5 antibodies elicited an outward current, together with hyperpolarization and inhibition of the cells. These effects were blocked by co-application of a TRPC5 antigen peptide. Voltage-clamp ramps in the presence or absence of TRPC5 antibodies indicated the presence of a current with a reversal potential close to -15 mV. Application of the non-selective TRPC channel blocker, flufenamic acid, had a similar effect, which could be occluded in cells pre-loaded with TRPC5 antibodies. Finally, using the same TRPC5 antibodies we found that most hcrt/orx cells show immunostaining for the TRPC5 subunit. These results suggest that hcrt/orx neurons are endowed with a constitutively active non-selective cation current which depends on TRPC channels containing the TRPC5 subunit and which is responsible for the depolarized and active state of these cells.

Role of Interstitial Branching in the Development of Visual Corticocortical Connections: A Time-Lapse and Fixed-Tissue Analysis	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						visual cortex; corticocortical; imaging; motility; two-photon; time lapse	CORTEX IN-VIVO; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; CORTICAL PATHWAYS; DENDRITIC SPINES; ENUCLEATED RATS; DIRECTED GROWTH; FUNCTIONAL MAPS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CRITICAL PERIOD	We combined fixed-tissue and time-lapse analyses to investigate the axonal branching phenomena underlying the development of topographically organized ipsilateral projections from area 17 to area 18a in the rat. These complementary approaches allowed us to relate static, large-scale information provided by traditional fixed-tissue analysis to highly dynamic, local, small-scale branching phenomena observed with two-photon timelapse microscopy in acute slices of visual cortex. Our fixed-tissue data revealed that labeled area 17 fibers invaded area 18a gray matter at topographically restricted sites, reaching superficial layers in significant numbers by postnatal day 6 (P6). Moreover, most parental axons gave rise to only one or occasionally a small number of closely spaced interstitial branches beneath 18a. Our time-lapse data showed that many filopodium-like branches emerged along parental axons in white matter or deep layers in area 18a. Most of these filopodial branches were transient, often disappearing after several minutes to hours of exploratory extension and retraction. These dynamic behaviors decreased significantly from P4, when the projection is first forming, through the second postnatal week, suggesting that the expression of, or sensitivity to, cortical cues promoting new branch addition in the white matter is developmentally down-regulated coincident with gray matter innervation. Together, these data demonstrate that the development of topographically organized corticocortical projections in rats involves extensive exploratory branching along parental axons and invasion of cortex by only a small number of interstitial branches, rather than the widespread innervation of superficial cortical layers by an initially exuberant population of branches.

CDF Collaboration	Observation of single top quark production and measurement of vertical bar V-tb vertical bar with CDF	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ONE-LOOP AMPLITUDES; CROSS-SECTION; ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER; PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; FERMILAB TEVATRON; COLLIDER DETECTOR; COLLISIONS; UPGRADE; PERFORMANCE; E(+)E(-)	We report the observation of electroweak single top quark production in 3: 2 fb(-1) of p (p) over bar collision data collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab at root s = 1.96 TeV. Candidate events in the W + jets topology with a leptonically decaying W boson are classified as signal-like by four parallel analyses based on likelihood functions, matrix elements, neural networks, and boosted decision trees. These results are combined using a super discriminant analysis based on genetically evolved neural networks in order to improve the sensitivity. This combined result is further combined with that of a search for a single top quark signal in an orthogonal sample of events with missing transverse energy plus jets and no charged lepton. We observe a signal consistent with the standard model prediction but inconsistent with the background-only model by 5.0 standard deviations, with a median expected sensitivity in excess of 5.9 standard deviations. We measure a production cross section of 2.3-(+0.6)(0.5) (stat + sys) pb, extract the value of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element vertical bar V-tb vertical bar = 0.91(-0.11)(+0.11) (stat + sys) +/- 0.07 (theory), and set a lower limit vertical bar V-tb vertical bar > 0.71 at the 95% C. L., assuming m(t) = 175 GeV/c(2).

Effects of oxytocin on recollections of maternal care and closeness	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						neurohypophyseal hormones; social cognition; social memory; individual differences; Syntocinon	PARENTAL BONDING INSTRUMENT; SOCIAL ATTACHMENT; MEMORY; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; ADULTHOOD; STABILITY; HUMANS; MODELS; SYSTEM	Although the infant-caregiver attachment bond is critical to survival, little is known about the biological mechanisms supporting attachment representations in humans. Oxytocin plays a key role in attachment bond formation and maintenance in animals and thus could be expected to affect attachment representations in humans. To investigate this possibility, we administered 24 IU intranasal oxytocin to healthy male adults in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover designed study and then assessed memories of childhood maternal care and closeness-two features of the attachment bond. We found that the effects of oxytocin were moderated by the attachment representations people possess, with less anxiously attached individuals remembering their mother as more caring and close after oxytocin (vs. placebo) but more anxiously attached individuals remembering their mother as less caring and close after oxytocin (vs. placebo). These data contrast with the popular notion that oxytocin has broad positive effects on social perception and are more consistent with the animal literature, which emphasizes oxytocin's role in encoding social memories and linking those memories to the reward value of the social stimulus.

Hypomorphic Temperature-Sensitive Alleles of NSDHL Cause CK Syndrome	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							LEMLI-OPITZ-SYNDROME; CHOLESTEROL-METABOLISM; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; STEROL BIOSYNTHESIS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; LINKAGE ANALYSIS; CHILD-SYNDROME; GENOME; MODEL; GENE	CK syndrome (CKS) is an X-linked recessive intellectual disability syndrome characterized by dysmorphism, cortical brain malformations, and an asthenic build. Through an X chromosome single-nucleotide variant scan in the first reported family, we identified linkage to a 5 Mb region on Xq28. Sequencing of this region detected a segregating 3 bp deletion (c.696_698del [p.Lys232del]) in exon 7 of NAD (P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL), a gene that encodes an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We also found that males with intellectual disability in another reported family with an NSDHL mutation (c.1098 dup [p.Arg367SerfsX33]) have CKS. These two mutations, which alter protein folding, show temperature-sensitive protein stability and complementation in Erg26-deficient yeast. As described for the allelic disorder CHILD syndrome, cells and cerebrospinal fluid from CKS patients have increased methyl sterol levels. We hypothesize that methyl sterol accumulation, not only cholesterol deficiency, causes CKS, given that cerebrospinal fluid cholesterol, plasma cholesterol, and plasma 24S-hydroxycholesterol levels are normal in males with CKS. In summary, CKS expands the spectrum of cholesterol-related disorders and insight into the role of cholesterol in human development.

However, CCR2 target validation in analgesia and the mechanism underlying antinociception produced by CCR2 antagonists remains poorly understood. In this study, in vitro and in vivo pharmacological approaches using a novel CCR2 antagonist, AZ889, strengthened the hypothesis of a CCR2 contribution to neuropathic pain and provided confidence over the possibilities to treat neuropathic pain with CCR2 antagonists. Results: We provided evidence that dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cells harvested from CCI animals responded to stimulation by CCL2 with a concentration-dependent calcium rise involving PLC-dependent internal stores. This response was associated with an increase in evoked neuronal action potentials suggesting these cells were sensitive to CCR2 signalling. Importantly, treatment with AZ889 abolished CCL2-evoked excitation confirming that this activity is CCR2-mediated. Neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the spinal cord were also excited by CCL2 applications indicating an important role of spinal CCR2 in neuropathic pain. We next showed that in vivo spinal intrathecal injection of AZ889 produced dose-dependent analgesia in CCI rats. Additionally, application of AZ889 to the exposed spinal cord inhibited evoked neuronal activity and confirmed that CCR2-mediated analgesia involved predominantly the spinal cord. Furthermore, AZ889 abolished NMDA-dependent wind-up of spinal withdrawal reflex pathway in neuropathic animals giving insight into the spinal mechanism underlying the analgesic properties of AZ889. Conclusions: Overall, this study strengthens the important role of CCR2 in neuropathic pain and highlights feasibility that interfering on this mechanism at the spinal level with a selective antagonist can provide new analgesia opportunities.

Here, we demonstrate that the miR-310-313 cluster is required for normal synaptic transmission at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. Loss of miR-310-313 cluster leads to a significant enhancement of neurotransmitter release, which can be rescued with temporally restricted expression of mir-310-313 in larval presynaptic neurons. Kinesin family member, Khc-73 is a functional target for miR-310-313 as its expression is increased in mir-310-313 mutants and reducing it restores normal synaptic function. Cluster mutants show an increase in the active zone protein Bruchpilot accompanied by an increase in electron dense T bars. Finally, we show that repression of Khc-73 by miR-310-313 cluster influences the establishment of normal synaptic homeostasis. Our findings establish a role for miRNAs in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.	[Tsurudome, Kazuya; Tsang, Karen; Liao, Edward H.; Ball, Robin; Penney, Jay; Elazzouzi, Fatima; Haghighi, A.

ALS-linked mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) alters mitochondrial protein composition and decreases protein import	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						motor neuron disease; proteomic; neurodegenerative disease; amyotrophic	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MOTOR-NEURONS; MOUSE MODEL; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; INHERITED ALS; CYTOCHROME-C; SPINAL-CORD; CELL-LINE; COMPLEX I; DISEASE	Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) cause familial ALS. Mutant SOD1 preferentially associates with the cytoplasmic face of mitochondria from spinal cords of rats and mice expressing SOD1 mutations. Two-dimensional gels and multidimensional liquid chromatography, in combination with tandem mass spectrometry, revealed 33 proteins that were increased and 21 proteins that were decreased in SOD1(G93A) rat spinal cord mitochondria compared with SOD1(WT) spinal cord mitochondria. Analysis of this group of proteins revealed a higher-than-expected proportion involved in complex I and protein import pathways. Direct import assays revealed a 30% decrease in protein import only in spinal cord mitochondria, despite an increase in the mitochondrial import components TOM20, TOM22, and TOM40. Recombinant SOD1(G93A) or SOD1(G85R), but not SOD1(WT) or a Parkinson's disease-causing, misfolded alpha-synuclein(E46K) mutant, decreased protein import by >50% in nontransgenic mitochondria from spinal cord, but not from liver. Thus, altered mitochondrial protein content accompanied by selective decreases in protein import into spinal cord mitochondria comprises part of the mitochondrial damage arising from mutant SOD1.

The cascade-correlation algorithm is a feed-forward neural network that builds its own topology from input and output units. Personal pronoun acquisition is an interesting non-linear problem in psychology. A mother will refer to her son as you and herself as me, but the son must infer for himself that when he speaks to his mother, she becomes you and he becomes me. Learning the shifting reference of these pronouns is a difficult task that most children master. We show that learning of two different noun-and-pronoun addressee patterns is consistent with naturalistic studies. We observe a surprising factor in pronoun reversal: increasing the amount of exposure to noun patterns can decrease or eliminate reversal errors in children.

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.

Participants included 622 adolescents aged 15 to 18 years in both urban and rural mainland China. Participants completed self-report measures of vulnerability factors and depressive symptoms and participated in interviews that assessed lifetime depression and negative life events over the previous 6 months. In addition, high dependency, self-criticism, neuroticism, and low self-perceived competence were associated with stress generation, independent of the effect of depressive symptoms and lifetime diagnosis of depression. Of note, no gender-by-vulnerability interactions were found in the present sample of youth. The findings suggest that the stress generation process may be generalizable to Chinese youth.

Eighty-seven percent of their placentas had an abnormality on the fetal side of the placenta, including umbilical cord lesions (39%), chorioamnionitis (35%) with fetal vasculitis (22%), chorionic plate meconium (30%), and fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (26%). A total of 48% displayed placental growth restriction. Chorioamnionitis with fetal vasculitis and chorionic plate meconium were significantly associated with brain injury (P = .03). Placental growth restriction appears to significantly offer protection against the development of these injuries (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Therapeutic hypothermia may not be effective in asphyxiated newborns whose placentas show evidence of chorioamnionitis with fetal vasculitis and chorionic plate meconium.

The autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) contributes to skeletal muscle proteolysis, but its contribution to diaphragmatic protein degradation in mechanically ventilated patients is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the autophagy pathway responses to CMV in the diaphragm and limb muscles of humans and to identify the roles of FOXO transcription factors in these responses. Methods: Muscle biopsies were obtained from nine control subjects and nine brain-dead organ donors. Subjects were mechanically ventilated for 2 to 4 hours and 15 to 276 hours, respectively. Activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system was detected by measuring mRNA expressions of Atrogin-1, MURF1, and protein expressions of UBC2, UBC4, and the alpha subunits of the 20S proteasome (MCP231). Activation of the ALP was detected by electron microscopy and by measuring the expressions of several autophagy-related genes. Total carbonyl content and HNE-protein adduct formation were measured to assess oxidative stress. Total AKT, phosphorylated and total FOXO1, and FOXO3A protein levels were also measured. Measurements and Main Results: Prolonged CMV triggered activation of the ALP as measured by the appearance of autophagosomes in the diaphragm and increased expressions of autophagy-related genes, as compared with controls. Induction of autophagy was associated with increased protein oxidation and enhanced expression of the FOXO1 gene, but not the FOXO3A gene. CMV also triggered the inhibition of both AKT expression and FOXO1 phosphorylation. Conclusions: We propose that prolonged CMV causes diaphragm disuse, which, in turn, leads to activation of the ALP through oxidative stress and the induction of the FOXO1 transcription factor.

Distinct Properties of Circulating CD8(+) T Cells in FTY720-Treated Patients With Multiple Sclerosis	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							FTY720; DIFFERENTIATION; FINGOLIMOD; PHENOTYPE; MEMORY; CCR2	Objective: To define the capacity of peripheral blood CD8(+) T cells from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving fingolimod (FTY720) to migrate in response to chemokines that contribute to trafficking into the central nervous system. Design: Peripheral blood T cells of FTY720-treated patients with MS (MS-FTY) are mainly CD8(+) CCR7(-) effector memory cells as CCR7(+) T cells are inhibited from exiting from secondary lymph nodes. Migration of CD8(+) T cells from MS-FTY patients and untreated donors to chemokines CXCL12 and CCL2 was assayed in vitro. Expression of CCL2 receptor (CCR2), CCR7, CD28, and CD27 on CD8(+) T cells was determined by flow cytometry. Setting: Montreal Neurological Institute's clinical research unit. Patients: The MS-FTY patients were part of the extension phase of FTY720 clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS. Results: In vitro addition of active (phosphorylated) FTY720 increased migration of CD8(+) T cells from untreated patients to CXCL12 and CCL2. The CD8(+) or CD8(+) CCR7(-) T cells from MS-FTY patients migrated less to CXCL12 and CCL2 compared with those from untreated donors. The proportion of CD8(+) CCR7(-) cells that express the CCL2 chemokine receptor, CCR2, was significantly reduced in the MS-FTY group. The CD8(+) CCR7(-) cells from the MS-FTY patients were enriched with CD27(-) CD28(-) (late effector) memory cells, a population with reduced expression of CCR2 compared with early (CD27(+) CD28(+)) effector memory cells. Conclusions: Therapy with FTY720 results in a subset of CD8(+) T cells with distinct functional migratory properties dominating the peripheral circulation. The expected forthcoming use of FTY720 as a sustained therapy for MS will clarify how this redistribution of lymphocyte populations affects the overall process of immune surveillance.

J	Keita, L; Mottron, L; Bertone, A				Keita, Luc; Mottron, Laurent; Bertone, Armando			Far Visual Acuity is Unremarkable in Autism: Do We Need to Focus on Crowding?	AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						autism; vision; acuity; crowding; neural; lateral interactions	SPECTRUM DISORDERS; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; INDIVIDUALS; RESOLUTION; DEPENDS	Although autism presents a unique perceptual phenotype defined in part by atypical (often enhanced) analysis of spatial information, few biologically plausible hypotheses have been advanced to explain its neural underpinnings. One plausible explanation is functional but altered lateral connectivity mediating early or local mechanisms selectively responsive to different stimulus attributes, including spatial frequency and contrast. The goal of the present study was first to assess far visual acuity in autism using Landolt-C optotypes defined by different local stimulus attributes. Second, we investigated whether acuity is differentially affected in autism when target optotypes are simultaneously presented with flanking stimuli at different distances. This typical detrimental "crowding effect" of flanking stimuli on target optotype discrimination is attributed to lateral inhibitory interaction of neurons encoding for visual properties of distracters close to the target. Results failed to demonstrate a between-group difference in acuity to Landolt-C optotypes, whether defined by luminance- or texture-contrast. However, the expected crowding effect at one gap-size opening distance was evidenced for the control group only; a small effect was observed for the autism group at two gap-size opening. These results suggest that although far visual acuity is unremarkable in autism, altered local lateral connectivity within early perceptual areas underlying spatial information processing in autism is atypical. Altered local lateral connectivity in autism might originate from an imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory neural signaling, resulting in changes regarding elementary feature extraction and subsequent downstream visual integration and visuo-spatial analysis. This notion is discussed within the context of characteristic lower- and higher-level perceptual processing in autism.

The female's response to her young is presented as a model motivational system and the mechanisms and neural circuitry through which the medial preoptic area regulates this responsivity is described. This analysis is then used in support of an argument for a greater recognition of the role of hypothalamic nuclei in the stimulation of appetitive behavior. In the subsequent section of the manuscript the adaptations of other motivational systems to the maternal state together with the research investigating the mechanisms that produce these changes are described. Finally, we examine how these multiple adaptations may be coordinated and integrated.

The paper in this issue by Kleitz-Nelson, Dominguez, and Ball (2010) shows how DA release in the medial preoptic area of male quail are activated in an androgen-dependent manner during appetitive and consummatory phases of sexual behavior, similar to that reported previously in male rats.

It has been proposed to represent a potential animal model of major depression. The purpose of our study was to examine the responses induced by MD in male and female adult Long-Evans rats in tasks designed to explore depressive-like behaviours (forced swimming test (FST), repeated open space swim test (OSST), sucrose solution consumption) and in the novel object recognition and object location tasks. A consistent sexual dimorphism was observed in the responses of male and female rats that underwent MD. In male rats, MD led to increased transitions between behaviours in the FST and increased consumption and preference for sucrose (1%) in comparison with non-deprived rats. In female rats, MD induced a decreased swimming activity on the second day of the OSST and reduced the cognitive performance in an object location task In both sexes, MD did not alter the swimming activity in the FST and the performance in a novel object recognition task. These divergent responses in male and female rats can be related to the gender differences which exist in depression. However, due to the low amplitude of responses obtained in our study, the MD model in Long-Evans rats does not seem to mimic symptoms of major depression. In contrast, our present results suggest the use of the MD model, especially in females, as a model of the dysthymia, a mild chronic-depressive condition, which has been related to poorer maternal relationship.

By preventing nonspecific cell adhesion while providing reactive groups facilitating subsequent protein grafting, CMD allowed achieving specific cell/tethered EGF interactions and therefore deriving unambiguous conclusions about various EGF grafting strategies. We demonstrate here that A-431 cell response to immobilized EGF is highly dependent on the bioactivity of the tagged protein being tethered, its proper orientation, and its surface density. Among all the approaches we tested, the oriented tethering of fully bioactive EGF via a de novo-designed coiled-coil capture system was shown to be the most efficient. That is, it led to the most intense and sustained phosphorylation of EGF receptors as well as to strong A-431 cell adhesion, the latter being comparable to that observed with amino-coated surfaces in the absence of CMD.

Latent inhibition is a task in which pre-exposure to a neutral stimulus, such as a tone, later impedes the association of that stimulus with a particular consequence, such as a shock. Previous work from our lab demonstrates that high levels of estradiol (E2) administered to ovariectomized (OVX) female rats abolishes latent inhibition when compared to female rats with low levels of E2 or male rats. To determine if this E2-induced impairment also occurs with the natural variations of ovarian hormones during the estrous cycle, this behavior was investigated in cycling female rats. In addition, pre-pubertal male and female rats were also tested in this paradigm to determine if the previously described sex differences are activational or organizational in nature. In a latent inhibition paradigm using a tone and a shock, adult rats were conditioned during different points of the estrous cycle. Rats conditioned during proestrus, a period of high E2 levels, exhibited attenuated latent inhibition when compared to rats conditioned during estrus or metestrus, periods associated with low levels of E2. Moreover, this effect is not seen until puberty indicating it is dependent on the surge of hormones at puberty. This study confirms recent findings that high E2 interferes with latent inhibition and is the first to show this is based in the activational actions of hormones. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This study was pursued to define the role played by NK3R located on dopamine neurones of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the regulation of MAP in SHR. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH SHR (16 weeks) were implanted permanently with i.c.v. and/or VTA guide cannulae. Experiments were conducted 24 h after catheterization of the abdominal aorta to measure MAP and heart rate (HR) in freely behaving rats. Cardiovascular responses to i.c.v. or VTA-injected NK3R agonist (senktide) and antagonists (SB222200 and R-820) were measured before and after systemic administration of selective antagonists for D1R (SCH23390), D2R (raclopride) or non-selective D2R (haloperidol), and after destruction of the VTA with ibotenic acid. KEY RESULTS I. c. v. or VTA-injected SB222200 and R-820 (500 pmol) evoked anti-hypertension, which was blocked by raclopride. Senktide (10, 25, 65 and 100 pmol) elicited greater increases of MAP and HR when injected in the VTA, and the cardiovascular response was blocked by R-820, SCH23390 and haloperidol. VTA-injected SB222200 prevented the pressor response to i.c.v. senktide, and vice versa, i.c.v. senktide prevented the anti-hypertension to VTA SB222200. Destruction of the VTA prevented the pressor response to i.c.v. senktide and the anti-hypertension to i.c.v. R-820. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The NK3R in the VTA is implicated in the maintenance of hypertension by increasing midbrain dopaminergic transmission in SHR. Hence, this receptor may represent a therapeutic target in the treatment of hypertension.

Do infections with parasites and exposure to pollution affect susceptibility to predation in johnny darters (Etheostoma nigrum)?

Three measures of antipredator behaviour were made: (1) capture time (i.e., the time taken to catch individual fish) was used as a proxy for the ability to evade predation, (2) capture order was the order in which fish kept in a single tank were taken from the tank, and (3) flight initiation distance was the distance at which the fish moved when approached by a model predator. Only capture time showed a significant correlation with parasitism or pollution status. A nonparametric permutational multivariate ANOVA showed that capture time was significantly correlated with capture location and the abundance of the brain-encysting trematode Ornithodiplostomum Dubois, 1936. Infection with Ornithodiplostomum sp. may have led to an increase in activity, which would be maladaptive for this cryptic, benthic fish under natural predation conditions. Pollution may have an indirect effect on predator susceptibility in johnny darters, by reducing the abundance of a behaviour-modifying parasite.	[Krause, Rachel J.; Grant, James W. A.; McLaughlin, J.

To further understand the role of acetylcholine in ACC, we characterized the firing properties of pyramidal neurons following muscarinic receptor activation. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in acute brain slices, we report long-lasting nonsynaptic plateau potentials and persistent firing induced by carbachol (CCh) in pyramidal neurons in layers II/III of rat ACC. CCh responses were abolished by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine or by inhibitors of G proteins and phospholipase C. Inhibiting L-type calcium channels with nifedipine, removing extracellular calcium or chelating intracellular calcium with BAPTA also abolished plateau potentials and persistent firing. Blockade of nonselective cation channels with flufenamic acid, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate or SKF-96365 suppressed CCh responses and voltage-clamp recordings of CCh-sensitive currents revealed a transient receptor potential canonical-like cationic conductance. The group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine hydrate induced plateau potentials and persistent firing that were mediated by mGluR5. Our data demonstrate that receptor-operated channels drive calcium-dependent plateau potentials and persistent firing in layers II/III of ACC. Therefore, acetylcholine- and glutamate-evoked persistent activity in ACC may play a mnemonic role by allowing transient storage of information during pain processing.

ANN has been adopted widely and put into practice by researchers in light of increasing concerns over ecological issues such as global warming, frequent El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and atmospheric circulation anomalies. Limitations exist and there is a potential risk for misuse in that ANN model parameters require typically higher overall sensitivity, and the chosen network structure is generally more dependent upon individual experience. ANNs, however, are relatively accurate when used for short-term predictions; despite global climate change research favoring the effects of interactions as the basis of study and the preference for long-term experimental research. ANNs remain a better choice than many traditional methods when dealing with nonlinear problems, and possesses great potential for the study of global climate change and ecological issues. ANNs can resolve problems that other methods cannot. This is especially true for situations in which measurements are difficult to conduct or when only incomplete data are available. It is anticipated that ANNs will be widely adopted and then further developed for global climate change and ecological research.

Striatal sensitivity to personal responsibility in a regret-based decision-making task	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING; TEMPORAL PREDICTION; BASAL GANGLIA; REWARD; BRAIN; RESPONSES; CHOICE; DISAPPOINTMENT; CONSEQUENCES	Regret and relief are complex emotional states associated with the counterfactual processing of nonobtained outcomes in a decision-making situation. In the "actor effect," a sense of agency and personal responsibility is thought to heighten these emotions. Using fMRI, we scanned volunteers (n = 22) as they played a task involving choices between two wheel-of-fortune gambles. We examined how neural responses to counterfactual outcomes were modulated by giving subjects the opportunity to change their minds, as a manipulation of personal responsibility. Satisfaction ratings to the outcomes were highly sensitive to the difference between the obtained and nonobtained outcome, and ratings following losses were lower on trials with the opportunity to change one's mind. Outcome-related activity in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex was positively related to the satisfaction ratings. The striatal response was modulated by the agency manipulation: Following losses, the striatal signal was significantly lower when the subject had the opportunity to change his/her mind. These results support the involvement of frontostriatal mechanisms in counterfactual thinking and highlight the sensitivity of the striatum to the effects of personal responsibility.

Neural correlates of rumination in depression	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MOOD DISORDERS; NEGATIVE MOOD; SELF; RESPONSES; NETWORK; FMRI; ABNORMALITIES; VULNERABILITY	Rumination, or recursive self-focused thinking, has important implications for understanding the development and maintenance of depressive episodes. Rumination is associated with the worsening of negative mood states, greater affective responding to negative material, and increased access to negative memories. The present study was designed to use fMRI to examine neural aspects of rumination in depressed and healthy control individuals. We used a rumination induction task to assess differences in patterns of neural activation during ruminative self-focus as compared with a concrete distraction condition and with a novel abstract distraction condition in 14 participants who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 14 healthy control participants. Depressed participants exhibited increased activation in the orbitofrontal cortex, subgenual anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as compared with healthy controls during rumination versus concrete distraction. Neural activity during rumination versus abstract distraction was greater for depressed than for control participants in the amygdala, rostral anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and parahippocampus. These findings indicate that ruminative self-focus is associated with enhanced recruitment of limbic and medial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions in depression.

THF is needed for the action of folate-dependent enzymes and is thus essential for DNA synthesis and methylation. The importance of this reaction is demonstrated by the effectiveness of antifolate medications used to treat cancer by inhibiting DHFR, thereby depleting THF and slowing DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Due to the pivotal role that DHFR plays in folate metabolism and cancer treatment, changes in the level of DHFR expression can affect susceptibility to a variety of diseases dependent on folate status such as spina bifida and cancer. Likewise, variability in DHFR expression can affect sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs such as the folate antagonist methotrexate. Alterations in DHFR expression can be due to polymorphisms in the DHFR gene. Several variations have recently been described in DHFR, including promoter polymorphisms, the 19-bp deletion allele and variations in 3'UTR. These polymorphisms seem to be functional, affecting mRNA levels through various interesting mechanisms, including regulation through RNA interference. Several groups have assessed the association of these polymorphisms with folate levels, risk of cancer and spina bifida as well as the outcome of diseases treated with MTX. The latter may lead to different treatment schedules, improving treatment efficacy and/or allowing for a reduction in drug side effects. This review will summarize present knowledge regarding the predictive potential of DHFR polymorphisms in disease and treatment.

"Jasper's Basic Mechanisms of the Epilepsies" Workshop	EPILEPSIA			English	Editorial Material						Antiepileptic therapies; Brain development; Classification; Epileptogenesis; Genetics; Epilepsy; Neuronal excitability; Seizures		P>In 1969, H.H. Jasper, A.A. Ward, and A. Pope and the Public Health Service Advisory Committee on the Epilepsies of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published the first edition on Basic Mechanisms of the Epilepsies (BME). Since then, basic and clinical researchers in epilepsy have gathered together each decade to assess where epilepsy research has been, what it has accomplished, and where it should go. In 1999, the third edition of BME was named in honor of H.H. Jasper. Projected for publication in 2011, the fourth edition of Jasper's BME will (1) synthesize the role of interactions between neurons, synapses, and glia in the initiation, spread, and arrest of seizures; (2) examine the molecular, cellular, and network plasticity mechanisms that subserve excitability, seizure susceptibility, and ultimately epileptogenesis; (3) provide a framework for expanding the genome of rare mendelian epilepsies and understanding the complex heredity responsible for common epilepsies; (4) explore cellular mechanisms of the two main groups of presently known Mendelian epilepsy genes, namely ion channelopathies and developmental epilepsy genes; and (5) for the first time, describe the current efforts to translate the discoveries in epilepsy disease mechanisms into molecular and cellular therapeutic strategies in order to repair and cure the epilepsies.

Intracarotid anesthetic procedures (IAPs) represent a unique method by which we can assess functioning of each hemisphere in isolation. We used this technique to explore deficits of awareness of specific functions-motor ability, naming, and comprehension-in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Some patients were injected with amobarbital, whereas others were injected with etomidate. We found that injection into the right hemisphere, or epileptogenic focus in the right hemisphere following injection in the left, resulted in the lowest levels of motor awareness. We also found a higher level of awareness for expressive language deficits and less awareness for receptive language deficits. Comparison of etomidate and amobarbital suggested more awareness following injection of etomidate. We discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of the right hemisphere's special role in awareness, and how research in other disorders and in comparative neurology has shaped our conceptualization of the neuroanatomy of insight.

Although considerable information has been collected on the function and anatomical connections of specific architectonic areas within the orbital and ventromedial frontal cortex of the macaque monkey, the location of comparable areas in the human brain remains controversial. We re-examined the comparability of orbital and ventromedial frontal areas across these two species and provide the first quantitative demonstration of architectonically comparable cortical areas in the human and the macaque brains. Images of Nissl-stained sections of the cortex were obtained at low magnification. Differences in the typical size of neurons in alternating pyramidal and granule cell layers were exploited to segregate the cortical layers before sampling. Profiles of areal neuronal density were sampled across the width of the cortex. The location of individual cortical layers was identified on each profile by sampling a set of equally sized images on which the cortical layers had been manually traced. The rank order of sampled architectonic features in comparable architectonic areas in the two species was significantly correlated. The differences in measured features between gyral and sulcal parts of the same architectonic area are at a minimum 3-4 times smaller than the differences between architectonic areas for the areas examined. Furthermore, the quantified architectonic features arrange areas within the orbital and ventromedial frontal cortex along two dimensions: an anterior-to-posterior and a medial-to-lateral dimension. On the basis of these findings, and in light of known anatomical connections in the macaque, this region of the human cortex appears to comprise at least two hierarchically structured networks of areas.

Osmotic and thermal control of magnocellular neurosecretory neurons - role of an N-terminal variant of trpv1	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						hypothalamus; mouse; osmoregulation; rat; vasopressin	RAT SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEUS; RECEPTOR POTENTIAL VANILLOID-4; NONSELECTIVE CATION CHANNEL; NORMAL THIRST RESPONSES; SALT-INTAKE BEHAVIOR; IN-VITRO; ANGIOTENSIN-II; VASOPRESSIN SECRETION; GLYCINE RECEPTORS; MOLECULAR-CLONING	The release of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) plays a key role in the osmoregulatory response of mammals to changes in salt or water intake and in the rate of water loss through evaporation during thermoregulatory cooling. Previous work has shown that the hypothalamus encloses the sensory elements that modulate vasopressin release during systemic changes in fluid osmolality or body temperature. These responses depend in part on a synaptic regulation of vasopressin neurons by afferent inputs arising from osmosensory and thermosensory neurons in the preoptic area. However, recent studies in rats and mice have shown that vasopressin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus also display intrinsic osmosensory and thermosensory properties. Isolated vasopressin neurons exposed to increases in perfusate temperature or osmolality generate increases in non-selective cation channel activity that cause membrane depolarization and increase neuronal excitability. These channels are calcium-permeable and can be blocked by ruthenium red. Moreover, intrinsic responses to osmotic and thermal stimuli are absent in magnocellular neurosecretory cells isolated from mice lacking the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (trpv1) gene, which encodes the capsaicin receptor. Immunostaining of vasopressin-releasing neurons with anti-TRPV1 antibodies reveals the presence of amino acids present in the carboxy terminus of the protein, but not those lying in the amino terminal domain. Thus, magnocellular neurosecretory neurons appear to express an N-terminal variant of trpv1 which lacks sensitivity to capsaicin, but which enables osmosensing and thermosensing.

It is unknown whether this grey matter loss is globally distributed over the entire brain or more pronounced in specific cortical brain regions. Fifty-one patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and 31 matched healthy subjects were included. For all subjects, magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained at inclusion and at 5-year follow-up. Nineteen patients (ab-)used cannabis but no other illicit drugs; 32 patients and the healthy comparison subjects did not use any drugs during the 5-year follow-up. At follow-up, clinical outcome was measured. To evaluate the local differences in cortical thickness change over five years between the two groups regression analysis was carried out over the cortical surface. At inclusion cortical thickness did not differ between patients and controls and between cannabis-using and non-using patients. Over the follow-up period we found excessive thinning of the right supplementary motor cortex, inferior frontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, occipital and parietal lobe in patients relative to controls after controlling for cannabis use. Patients who used cannabis showed additional thinning in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left occipital lobe as compared to those patients that did not use cannabis during the scan interval. First-episode schizophrenia patients who use cannabis show a more pronounced cortical thinning than non-using patients in areas known for their high density of CB1 receptors, such as the ACC and the DLPFC.

Here, we show that the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGL alpha) and beta (DAGL beta), and degradation, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), can be found in oligodendrocytes at different developmental stages. Moreover, cultured oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) express DAGL alpha and beta abundantly, resulting in the stronger production of 2-AG than in differentiated oligodendrocytes. The opposite is observed with MAGL. CBI and CB2 receptor antagonists (SR141716 and AM630) impaired OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes and likewise, inhibiting DAGL activity with RHC-80267 or tetrahydrolipstatin also blocked oligodendrocyte maturation, an effect reversed by the addition of exogenous 2-AG. Likewise, 2-AG synthesis disruption using specific siRNAs against DAGL alpha and DAGL beta significantly reduced myelin protein expression in vitro, whereas a pharmacological gain-of-function approach by using cannabinoid agonists or MAGL inhibition had the opposite effects. ERK/MAPK pathway is implicated in oligodendrocyte differentiation because PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1, abrogated oligodendrocyte maturation. The cannabinoid receptor antagonists and RHC-80267 all diminished basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, effects that were partially reversed by the addition of 2-AG. Overall, our data suggest a novel role of endocannabinoids in oligodendrocyte differentiation such that constitutive release of 2-AG activates cannabinoid receptors in an autocrine/paracrine way in OPCs, stimulating the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.

A Proteome Map of Axoglial Specializations Isolated and Purified from Human Central Nervous System	GLIA			English	Article						myelin; node of Ranvier; myelin inhibition; multiple sclerosis; white matter disorder	MYELIN BASIC-PROTEIN; PROTEOLIPID PROTEIN; TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEINS; MOLECULAR ANATOMY; MESSENGER-RNAS; COMPACT MYELIN; CNS MYELIN; OLIGODENDROCYTES; EXPRESSION; RANVIER	Compact myelin, the paranode, and the juxtaparanode are discrete domains that are formed on myelinated axons. In humans, neurological disorders associated with loss of myelin, including Multiple Sclerosis, often also result in disassembly of the node of Ranvier. Despite the importance of these domains in the proper functioning of the CNS, their molecular composition and assembly mechanism remains largely unknown. We therefore performed a large-scale proteomics MudPIT screen for the identification of proteins in human myelin and axogliasomal fractions. We identified over 1,000 proteins in these fractions. Since even minor perturbations in neuron-glial interactions can uncouple the glial support of axons, the proteome map presented here can be used as a reference library for "myelin health" and disease states, including white matter disorders such as leukodystrophies and multiple sclerosis.

However, across-center differences in contrast sensitivity, spatial uniformity, etc., may lead to tissue classification or image registration differences that could reduce or wholly offset the enhanced statistical power of multicenter data. Prior work has validated volumetric multicenter MRI, but robust methods for assessing reliability and power of multisite analyses with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness measurement (CORT) are not yet available. We developed quantitative methods to investigate the reproducibility of VBM and CORT to detect group differences and estimate heritability when MRI scans from different scanners running different acquisition protocols in a multicenter setup are included. The method produces brain maps displaying information such as lowest detectable effect size (or heritability) and effective number of subjects in the multicenter study. We applied the method to a five-site multicenter calibration study using scanners from four different manufacturers, running different acquisition protocols. The reliability maps showed an overall good comparability between the sites, providing a reasonable gain in sensitivity in most parts of the brain. In large parts of the cerebrum and cortex scan pooling improved heritability estimates, with "effective-N" values upto the theoretical maximum. For some areas, "optimal-pool" maps indicated that leaving out a site would give better results. The reliability maps also reveal which brain regions are in any case difficult to measure reliably (e.g., around the thalamus). These tools will facilitate the design and analysis of multisite VBM and CORT studies for detecting group differences and estimating heritability. Hum Brain Mapp 31: 1967-1982, 2010.

A single center prospective follow-up study (Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion tensor and Magnetic resonance imaging Cohort study (RUN DMC)) was performed involving 503 nondemented elderly individuals (50-85 years) with a history of symptomatic cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Age was associated with a global reduction in cortical thickness, and this relationship was strongest for ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, auditory cortex, Wernicke's area, superior temporal lobe, and primary visual cortex. Right and left hemispheres differed in the thickness of language-related areas. White matter (WM) lesions were generally negatively correlated with cortical thickness, primarily in individuals over the age of 60, with the notable exception of Brodmann areas 4 and 5, which were positively correlated in age groups 50-60 and 60-70, respectively. The observed pattern of age-related decline may explain problems in memory and executive functions, which are already well documented in individuals with SVD. The additional gray matter loss affecting visual and auditory cortex, and specifically the head region of primary motor cortex, may indicate morphological correlates of impaired sensory and motor functions. The paradoxical positive relationship between WM lesion volume and cortical thickness in some areas may reflect early compensatory hyper-trophy. This study raises a further interest in the mechanisms underlying cerebral gray and white matter degeneration in association with SVD, which will require further investigation with diffusion weighted and longitudinal MR studies.

Mapping of numerous disease-associated expression polymorphisms in primary peripheral blood CD4+lymphocytes	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; FAMILY-BASED ASSOCIATION; HUMAN GENE-EXPRESSION; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; ASTHMA; POPULATIONS; MICROARRAY; CELLS; RISK	Genome-wide association studies of human gene expression promise to identify functional regulatory genetic variation that contributes to phenotypic diversity. However, it is unclear how useful this approach will be for the identification of disease-susceptibility variants. We generated gene expression profiles for 22 184 mRNA transcripts using RNA derived from peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes, and genome-wide genotype data for 516 512 autosomal markers in 200 subjects. We screened for cis-acting variants by testing variants mapping within 50 kb of expressed transcripts for association with transcript abundance using generalized linear models. Significant associations were identified for 1585 genes at a false discovery rate of 0.05 (corresponding to P-values ranging from 1 x 10(-91) to 7 x 10(-4)). Importantly, we identified evidence of regulatory variation for 119 previously mapped disease genes, including 24 examples where the variant with the strongest evidence of disease-association demonstrates strong association with specific transcript abundance. The prevalence of cis-acting variants among disease-associated genes was 63% higher than the genome-wide rate in our data set (P = 6.41 x 10(-6)), and although many of the implicated loci were associated with immune-related diseases (including asthma, connective tissue disorders and inflammatory bowel disease), associations with genes implicated in non-immune-related diseases including lipid profiles, anthropomorphic measurements, cancer and neurologic disease were also observed. Genetic variants that confer inter-individual differences in gene expression represent an important subset of variants that contribute to disease susceptibility. Population-based integrative genetic approaches can help identify such variation and enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits.

Health Condition Prediction of Gears Using a Recurrent Neural Network Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						Gearbox; health condition; prediction; recurrent neural network	MAINTENANCE	The development of accurate health condition prediction approaches has been a key research topic in condition based maintenance (CBM) in recent years. However, current health condition prediction approaches are not accurate enough, which has become the bottleneck for achieving the full power of CBM. Neural network based methods have been considered to be a very promising category of methods for equipment health condition prediction. In this paper, we propose a neural network prediction model called extended recurrent neural network (ERNN). An ERNN based approach is developed for health condition prediction of gearboxes based on the vibration data collected from a gearbox experimental system. The results demonstrate the capability of the ERNN based approach for producing satisfactory health condition prediction results. A comparative study based on the gearbox experiment data further establishes ERNN as an effective recurrent neural network model for equipment health condition prediction.

In vivo research in mice suggested that in the brain, microglia might be involved in activating the inflammatory response against S. suis. The aim of this study was to better understand the interactions between S. suis and microglia. Murine microglial cells were infected with a virulent wild-type strain of S. suis. Two isogenic mutants deficient at either capsular polysaccharide (CPS) or hemolysin production were also included. CPS contributed to S. suis resistance to phagocytosis and regulated the inflammatory response by hiding proinflammatory components from the bacterial cell wall, while the absence of hemolysin, a potential cytotoxic factor, did not have a major impact on S. suis interactions with microglia. Wild-type S. suis induced enhanced expression of Toll-like receptor 2 by microglial cells, as well as phophotyrosine, protein kinase C, and different mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling events. However, cells infected with the CPS-deficient mutant showed overall stronger and more sustained phosphorylation profiles. CPS also modulated inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and further nitric oxide production from S. suis-infected microglia. Finally, S. suis-induced NF-kappa B translocation was faster for cells stimulated with the CPS-deficient mutant, suggesting that bacterial cell wall components are potent inducers of NF-kappa B. These results contribute to increase the knowledge of mechanisms underlying S. suis inflammation in the brain and will be useful in designing more efficient anti-inflammatory strategies for meningitis.

This study summarizes the effects of war-related stress on all-cause mortality using meta-analyses and meta-regressions. Methods A keyword search was performed, supplemented by extensive iterative hand-searches for observational studies of war-related stress and mortality. Two hundred and twenty mortality risk estimates from 30 studies were extracted, providing data on more than 9 million persons. Results The mean hazard ratio (HR) was 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.13] among HRs adjusted for age and additional covariates. The mean effect for men was 1.14 (CI 1.00-1.31), and for women it was 0.92 (CI 0.66-1.28). No differences were found for various follow-up durations or for various types of war stress. Neither civilians nor military personnel had an elevated mortality risk. Those exposed to a combat zone during the Vietnam War had a slightly higher chance of death (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.00-1.23). Conclusions The results show that, over all, exposure to war-stress did not increase the risk of death when studies were well controlled. Effects were small when found. This lack of substantial effect may be the result of selection processes, developed resiliency and/or institutional support.

Uri			In Glaucoma the Upregulated Truncated TrkC.T1 Receptor Isoform in Glia Causes Increased TNF-alpha Production, Leading to Retinal Ganglion Cell Death	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; NITRIC-OXIDE PRODUCTION; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; MOUSE MODEL; IN-VIVO; NEUROTROPHIC RATIONALE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GLUTAMATE LEVELS; DEGENERATION; INHIBITION	PURPOSE. Glaucoma is a distinct neuropathy characterized by the chronic and progressive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The etiology of RGC death remains unknown. Risk factors for glaucomatous RGC death are elevated intraocular pressure and glial production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Previously, the authors showed that glaucoma causes a rapid upregulation of a neurotrophin receptor truncated isoform lacking the kinase domain, TrkC.T1, in retina. Here they examined the biological role of TrkC.T1 during glaucoma progression. METHODS. Rat and mouse models of chronic ocular hypertension were used. Immunofluorescence Western blot analysis and in situ mRNA hybridization were used to identify cells upregulating TrkC.T1. A genetic model of engineered mice lacking TrkC.T1 (TrkC.T1(-/-)) was used to validate a role for this receptor in glaucoma. Pharmacologic studies were conducted to evaluate intravitreal delivery of agonists or antagonists of TrkC. T1, compared with controls, during glaucoma. Surviving RGCs were quantified by retrograde-labeling techniques. Production of neurotoxic TNF-alpha and alpha 2 macroglobulin were quantified. RESULTS. TrkC.T1 was upregulated in retinal glia, with a pattern similar to that of TNF-alpha. TrkC.T1(-/-) mice had normal retinas. However, during experimental glaucoma, TrkC.T1 (/) mice had lower rates of RGC death and produced less TNF-alpha than wild-type littermates. In rats with glaucoma, the pharmacologic use of TrkC antagonists delayed RGC death and reduced the production of retinal TNF-alpha. CONCLUSIONS. TrkC.T1 is implicated in glaucomatous RGC death through the control of glial TNF-alpha production. Overall, the data point to a paracrine mechanism whereby elevated intraocular pressure upregulated glial TrkC.T1 expression in glia; TrkC.T1 controlled glial TNF-alpha production, and TNF-alpha caused RGC death.

Cases where neurodevlopmental conditions defined by a distinct genetic etiology share behavioral phenotypes are exemplary, as is the case for autism and Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). In this paper and its companion paper, we propose a method for assessing the functional link between genotype and neural alteration across these target conditions by comparing their perceptual signatures. In the present paper, we discuss how such signatures can be used to (1) define and differentiate various aspects of neural functioning in autism and FXS, and subsequently, (2) to infer candidate causal (genetic) mechanisms based on such signatures (see companion paper, this issue).

These perceptually-driven hypotheses are based on differential performance evidenced only at the earliest stages of visual information processing, mediated by local neural network functioning. In this paper, we first review how most large-scale neural models are unable to address atypical low-level perceptual functioning in autism, and then suggest how condition-specific, local neural endophenotypes (described in our companion paper) can be incorporated into causal models to infer target candidate gene or gene clusters that are implicated in autism's pathogenesis. The usefulness of such a translational research approach is discussed.

Uri			Chronic and Acute Models of Retinal Neurodegeneration TrkA Activity Are Neuroprotective whereas p75(NTR) Activity Is Neurotoxic through a Paracrine Mechanism	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							P75 NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR; GANGLION-CELL DEATH; EXPERIMENTAL GLAUCOMA; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; MOUSE MODEL; IN-VIVO; DEGENERATION; EXPRESSION; SURVIVAL; LIGANDS	In normal adult retinas, NGF receptor TrkA is expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGC), whereas glia express p75(NTR). During retinal injury, endogenous NGF, TrkA, and p75(NTR) are up-regulated. Paradoxically, neither endogenous NGF nor exogenous administration of wild type NGF can protect degenerating RGCs, even when administered at high frequency. Here we elucidate the relative contribution of NGF and each of its receptors to RGC degeneration in vivo. During retinal degeneration due to glaucoma or optic nerve transection, treatment with a mutant NGF that only activates TrkA, or with a biological response modifier that prevents endogenous NGF and proNGF from binding to p75(NTR) affords significant neuroprotection. Treatment of normal eyes with an NGF mutant-selective p75(NTR) agonist causes progressive RGC death, and in injured eyes it accelerates RGC death. The mechanism of p75(NTR) action during retinal degeneration due to glaucoma is paracrine, by increasing production of neurotoxic proteins TNF-alpha and alpha(2)-macroglobulin. Antagonists of p75(NTR) inhibit TNF-alpha and alpha(2)-macroglobulin up-regulation during disease, and afford neuroprotection. These data reveal a balance of neuroprotective and neurotoxic mechanisms in normal and diseased retinas, and validate each neurotrophin receptor as a pharmacological target for neuroprotection.

We characterize here a novel drug development platform that is broadly applicable for the development of new therapeutics with increased brain penetration. The platform is based on the Angiopep-2 peptide, a sequence derived from ligands that bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), a receptor expressed on the BBB. Fluorescent imaging studies of a Cy5.5Angiopep-2 conjugate and immunohistochemical studies of injected Angiopep-2 in mice demonstrated efficient transport across the BBB into brain parenchyma and subsequent co-localization with the neuronal nuclei-selective marker NeuN and the glial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Uptake of [125I]-Angiopep-2 into brain endothelial cells occurred by a saturable mechanism involving LRP-1. The primary sequence and charge of Angiopep-2 were crucial for its passage across the BBB. Overall, the results demonstrate the significant potential of this platform for the development of novel neurotherapeutics.

Here, we studied the long-term effects of daily music and speech listening on auditory sensory memory after middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. In the acute recovery phase, 60 patients who had middle cerebral artery stroke were randomly assigned to a music listening group, an audio book listening group, or a control group. Auditory sensory memory, as indexed by the magnetic MMN (MMNm) response to changes in sound frequency and duration, was measured 1 week (baseline), 3 months, and 6 months after the stroke with whole-head magnetoencephalography recordings. Fifty-four patients completed the study. Results showed that the amplitude of the frequency MMNm increased significantly more in both music and audio book groups than in the control group during the 6-month poststroke period. In contrast, the duration MMNm amplitude increased more in the audio book group than in the other groups. Moreover, changes in the frequency MMNm amplitude correlated significantly with the behavioral improvement of verbal memory and focused attention induced by music listening. These findings demonstrate that merely listening to music and speech after neural damage can induce long-term plastic changes in early sensory processing, which, in turn, may facilitate the recovery of higher cognitive functions. The neural mechanisms potentially underlying this effect are discussed.

Application of Ice Cold Irrigation During Vascular Pedicle Control of Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: EnSeal Instrument Cooling to Reduce Collateral Thermal Tissue Damage	JOURNAL OF ENDOUROLOGY			English	Article							BIPOLAR CAUTERY; PORCINE MODEL; ENERGY; IMPACT; COMPLICATIONS; MECHANISMS; OUTCOMES; ANATOMY; SURGERY; SPREAD	Background and Purpose: Energy-based hemostasis of the prostatic vascular pedicles (PVP) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) may cause collateral thermal injury to adjacent neural tissue and has been shown to negatively impact sexual function recovery. The unique engineering design of the EnSeal (R) (Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH) has been demonstrated to limit collateral thermal tissue damage to <1.0 mm. Use of tissue and instrument cooling before and during device activation may potentially further reduce thermal spread. As such, we sought to evaluate the collateral tissue effects of EnSeal with or without cold saline irrigation (CSI) during PVP control. Patients and Methods: The EnSeal Trio device was used for PVP control in 20 consecutive men undergoing bilateral, non nerve-sparing RARP. Ipsilateral vascular pedicles were randomly selected to EnSeal plus CSI (<4 degrees C) application to the tissue before and during device activation or EnSeal alone. The primary end point was the distance of thermal injury from the inked margin using both hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and terminal transferase uridyl nick end-labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis staining. A mean of three measurements was taken for each pedicle. Pathologic analysis was performed by a single, blinded uropathologist. Results: Mean distance of thermal injury from the inked margin using H&E staining was 0.31 mm (range 0.15-0.40 mm) and 0.98 mm (range 0.7-1.2 mm) for the EnSeal plus CSI and EnSeal alone, respectively (P < 0.0001). TUNEL staining also demonstrated lateral tissue damage of 0.39 mm (range 0.2-0.5 mm) and 1.12 mm (range 0.9-1.3 mm), respectively (P < 0.001). No complications related to hemostasis or postoperative bleeding were observed in the study. Conclusions: The hemostatic properties of EnSeal work effectively when submerged in CSI. Adjacent thermal tissue damage is significantly minimized with the addition of CSI. This may have a beneficial impact on nerve preservation and sexual function outcomes after RARP.

Eight neuronal populations in a given column - an excitatory population and an inhibitory population per layer - are assumed to be coupled via effective connections of unknown strengths that need to be estimated. The effective connections are constrained to anatomical connections that have been shown to exist in previous anatomical studies. The neural input to a cortical column is directed into the two populations in L4. The anatomically-constrained effective connectivity is captured by a system of 16 stochastic differential equations. Solving these equations yields the average postsynaptic potentials and transmembrane currents generated in each population. The current source density (CSD) responses in each layer, which serve as the model observations, are equated in the model to the sum of all currents generated within that layer. The model is implemented in a continuous-discrete state-space framework, and the innovation method is used for estimating the model parameters from CSD data. To this end, local field potential (LFP) responses to forepaw stimulation were recorded in rat area S1 using multi-channel linear probes. LFPs were converted to CSD signals, which were averaged within each layer, yielding one CSD response per layer. To estimate the effective strengths of connections between all cortical layers, the model was fitted to these CSD signals. The results show that the pattern of effective interactions is strongly influenced by the pattern of strengths of the anatomical connections; however, these two patterns are not identical. The estimated anatomically-constrained effective connectivity matrix and the anatomical connectivity matrix shared five of their six strongest connections, although rankings according to connection strength differed. The strongest effective connections were from excitatory neurons in layer 4 to excitatory neurons in layer 2/3. Our study shows the feasibility of estimating anatomically-constrained effective connectivity within a cortical column, and indicates that there is a strong influence of anatomical connectivity on effective connectivity between cortical layers.

Using SSTR-expressing glioma cells harbouring low levels of EGFR (U87MG) or transfected to overexpress EGFR (U87/EGFR) or a variant (U87/EGFRvIII), we showed that Iressa, alone or in combination with the DNA damaging agent TMZ, and combi-molecules RA2 and RA5 inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR in U87MG and more moderately in U87/EGFR and U87/EGFRvIII transfected cells. This translated into equivalent levels of Erk 1/2 inhibition. Activation of SSTRs with OCT did not modulate the effects of the various treatments on Erk 1/2 phosphorylation. Likewise, SSTR activation did not alter TMZ- or DNA-damaging combi-molecules, RA2 and RA5, induced p53 activation nor upregulation. However, SSTR activation significantly shifted TMZ-, RA2- and RA5-induced cell-cycle arrest to earlier phases (i.e., G2/M to late S, late S to S, S to G1). Further analysis showed that apoptosis was not induced. This was in agreement with the fact that p53 activation did not induce Bax upregulation nor did EGFR inhibition promote Bad dephosphorylation. Moreover, enhancement of survivin, an anti-apoptotic protein, expression was observed. The results in toto suggest that the combination of SSTR activation with EGFR inhibition and DNA damage affects cell-cycle progression but a disconnection between the targeted signalling pathways in these brain tumour cells precludes synergistic cell-killing by the triple growth inhibitory events.

Rapid microelectrode measurements and the origin and regulation of extracellular glutamate in rat prefrontal cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						basal; chronic; freely moving; tetrodotoxin; d; l-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; AFFINITY TRANSPORTER MECHANISMS; RESOLUTION BRAIN MICRODIALYSIS; INDUCED FLUORESCENCE DETECTION; EXCITATORY AMINO-ACIDS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; FREELY MOVING RATS; IN-VIVO; MULTISITE MICROELECTRODE; BASAL GANGLIA	P>Glutamate in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a significant role in several mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, addiction and anxiety. Previous studies on PFC glutamate-mediated function have used techniques that raise questions on the neuronal versus astrocytic origin of glutamate. The present studies used enzyme-based microelectrode arrays to monitor second-by-second resting glutamate levels in the PFC of awake rats. Locally applied drugs were employed in an attempt to discriminate between the neuronal or glial components of the resting glutamate signal. Local application of tetrodotoxin (sodium channel blocker), produced a significant (similar to 40%) decline in resting glutamate levels. In addition significant reductions in extracellular glutamate were seen with locally applied omega-conotoxin (MVIIC; similar to 50%; calcium channel blocker), and the mGluR(2/3) agonist, LY379268 (similar to 20%), and a significant increase with the mGluR(2/3) antagonist LY341495 (similar to 40%), effects all consistent with a large neuronal contribution to the resting glutamate levels. Local administration of D,L-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (glutamate transporter inhibitor) produced an similar to 120% increase in extracellular glutamate levels, supporting that excitatory amino acid transporters, which are largely located on glia, modulate clearance of extracellular glutamate. Interestingly, local application of (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine (cystine/glutamate antiporter inhibitor), produced small, non-significant bi-phasic changes in extracellular glutamate versus vehicle control. Finally, pre-administration of tetrodotoxin completely blocked the glutamate response to tail pinch stress. Taken together, these results support that PFC resting glutamate levels in rats as measured by the microelectrode array technology are at least 40-50% derived from neurons. Furthermore, these data support that the impulse flow-dependent glutamate release from a physiologically -evoked event is entirely neuronally derived.

Mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in early-blind subjects. J Neurophysiol 104: 2995-3008, 2010. First published July 28, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00983.2009. A variety of studies have demonstrated enhanced blood oxygenation level dependent responses to auditory and tactile stimuli within occipital cortex as a result of early blindness. However, little is known about the organizational principles that drive this cross-modal plasticity. We compared BOLD responses to a wide variety of auditory and tactile tasks (vs. rest) in early-blind and sighted subjects. As expected, cross-modal responses were larger in blind than in sighted subjects in occipital cortex for all tasks (cross-modal plasticity). Within both blind and sighted subject groups, we found patterns of cross-modal activity that were remarkably similar across tasks: a large proportion of cross-modal responses within occipital cortex are neither task nor stimulus specific. We next examined the mechanisms underlying enhanced BOLD responses within early-blind subjects. We found that the enhancement of cross-modal responses due to early blindness was best described as an additive shift, suggesting that cross-modal plasticity within blind subjects does not originate from either a scaling or unmasking of cross-modal responsivities found in sighted subjects.

Rapid Online Correction Is Selectively Suppressed During Movement With a Visuomotor Transformation	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; ANTI-SACCADE TASK; VISUAL FEEDBACK INFORMATION; DIRECTED ARM MOVEMENTS; REACHING MOVEMENTS; H-REFLEX; POSITION INFORMATION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; HAND ORIENTATION; PRISM ADAPTATION	Gritsenko V, Kalaska JF. Rapid online correction is selectively suppressed during movement with a visuomotor transformation. J Neurophysiol 104: 3084-3104, 2010. First published September 15, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00909.2009. Reaching movements to visual targets are under fast feedback control, which can rapidly correct an ongoing movement for errors. This study investigates how this online correction is affected by the application of a new visuomotor transformation. Thirty-two subjects made planar pointing movements to visual targets. Vision of the arm was prevented, and hand position was represented by a cursor displayed in the movement plane. In some trials, the target abruptly changed location at the onset of arm movement, which required a rapid correction of movement direction. After performing baseline trials, some subjects were required to adapt to a mirror-image transformation that inverted the visual feedback of their hand position across the body midline, whereas others were not familiarized with the transformation. Afterward, subjects' online correction was tested with target jumps in the presence of the mirror transformation. Results show that after short-term motor adaptation to the mirror transformation there was a selective suppression of the rapid non-mirror correction in the direction of visual target displacement but no mirror reversal. The suppression occurred within the first few trials after the introduction of the mirror transformation, and it was strongest for the movements in which the transformation caused the largest dissociation between the target location and hand movement. Finally, whether or not the short-latency non-mirror correction was suppressed in a given trial, the mirror correction occurred at the same latency as the onset time of voluntary correction in subjects who had not experienced the mirror transformation.

Electrical stimulation of the frontal eye fields in the head-free macaque evokes kinematically normal 3D gaze shifts. J Neurophysiol 104: 3462-3475, 2010. First published September 23, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.01032.2009. The frontal eye field (FEF) is a region of the primate prefrontal cortex that is central to eye-movement generation and target selection. It has been shown that neurons in this area encode commands for saccadic eye movements. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the FEF may be involved in the generation of gaze commands for the eye and the head. To test this suggestion, we systematically stimulated (with pulses of 300 Hz frequency, 200 ms duration, 30-100 mu A intensity) the FEF of two macaques, with the head unrestrained, while recording three-dimensional (3D) eye and head rotations. In a total of 95 sites, the stimulation consistently elicited gaze-orienting movements ranging in amplitude from 2 to 172, directed contralateral to the stimulation site, and with variable vertical components. These movements were typically a combination of eye-in-head saccades and head-in-space movements. We then performed a comparison between the stimulation-evoked movements and gaze shifts voluntarily made by the animal. The kinematics of the stimulation-evoked movements (i.e., their spatiotemporal properties, their velocity-amplitude relationships, and the relative contributions of the eye and the head as a function of movement amplitude) were very similar to those of natural gaze shifts. Moreover, they obeyed the same 3D constraints as the natural gaze shifts (i.e., modified Listing's law for eye-in-head movements). As in natural gaze shifts, saccade and vestibuloocular reflex torsion during stimulation-evoked movements were coordinated so that at the end of the head movement the eye-in-head ended up in Listing's plane. In summary, movements evoked by stimulation of the FEF closely resembled those of naturally occurring eye-head gaze shifts. Thus we conclude that the FEF explicitly encodes gaze commands and that the kinematic aspects of eye-head coordination are likely specified by downstream mechanisms.	[Crawford, J.

Neuronal Activity in the Visual Cortex Reveals the Temporal Order of Cognitive Operations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							OBJECT-BASED ATTENTION; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MACAQUE AREA V4; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; DISTINCT MODES; FILLING-IN; V1; MONKEY	Most mental processes consist of a number of processing steps that are executed sequentially. The timing of the individual mental operations can usually only be estimated indirectly, from the pattern of reaction times. In vision, however, many processing steps are associated with the modulation of neuronal activity in early visual areas. Here we exploited this association to elucidate the time course of neuronal activity related to each of the self-paced mental processing steps in complex visual tasks. We trained monkeys to perform two tasks, search-trace and trace-search, which required performing a sequence of two operations: a visual search for a specific color and the mental tracing of a curve. We used multielectrode recording techniques to monitor the representations of multiple visual items in area V1 at the same time and found that the relevant curve as well as the target of visual search evoked enhanced neuronal activity with a timing that depended on the order of operations. This modulation of neuronal activity in early visual areas could allow these areas to (1) act as a cognitive blackboard that permits the exchange of information between successive processing steps of a sequential visual task and to (2) contribute to the orderly progression of task-dependent endogenous attention shifts that are driven by task structure and evolve over hundreds of milliseconds.

The aim of this study was to evaluate, using diffusion tensor tractography, the white matter fibers crossing the hippocampus and the amygdala, and to perform a volumetric analysis and an anatomical study of the connections of these 2 structures. As a second step, the authors studied the white matter tracts crossing a virtual volume of resection corresponding to a selective amygdalohippocampectomy. Methods. Twenty healthy right-handed individuals underwent 3-T MR imaging. Volumetric regions of interest were manually created to delineate the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the volume of resection. White matter fiber tracts were parcellated using the fiber assignment for continuous tracking tractography algorithm. All fibers were registered with the anatomical volumes. Results. In all participants, the authors identified fibers following the hippocampus toward the fornix, the splenium of the corpus callosum, and the dorsal hippocampal commissure. With respect to the fibers crossing the amygdala, the authors identified the stria terminalis and the uncinate fasciculus. The virtual resection disrupted part of the fornix, fibers connecting the 2 hippocampi, and fibers joining the orbitofrontal cortex. The approach created a theoretical frontotemporal disconnection and also interrupted fibers joining the temporal pole and the occipital area. Conclusions. This diffusion tensor tractography study allowed for good visualization of some of the connections of the amygdala and hippocampus. The authors observed that the virtual selective amygdalohippocampectomy disconnected a large number of fibers connecting frontal, temporal, and occipital areas.

The aim of this study was to compare IQ and memory outcomes at the 1-year follow-up in patients with medically refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MILE) due to hippocampal sclerosis. All patients were treated using a corticoamygdalohippocampectomy (CAH) or a selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH). Methods. The data of 256 patients who underwent surgery for MTLE were retrospectively evaluated. One hundred twenty-three patients underwent a CAH (63 [right side] and 60 [left side]), and 133 underwent an SelAH (61 [right side] and 72 [left side]). A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was assessed before and 1 year after surgery, and the results were compared between the surgical procedures. Furthermore, seizure outcome was compared using the Engel classification scheme. Results. At 1-year follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference between the surgical approaches with respect to seizure outcome. Overall, IQ scores showed improvement, but verbal IQ decreased after left SelAH. Verbal memory impairment was seen after left-sided resections especially in cases of SelAH, and nonverbal memory decreased after right-sided resection, especially for CAH. Left-sided resections produced some improvement in nonverbal memory. Older age at surgery, longer duration of seizures, greater seizure frequency before surgery, and poor seizure control after surgery were associated with poorer memory. Conclusions. Both CAH and SelAH can lead to several cognitive impairments depending on the side of the surgery. The authors suggest that the optimal type of surgical approach should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

The Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines (2007) state that low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin should be used to prevent VTE complications, but suggest that there is an increased risk of expansion of intracranial hemorrhages (ICH) with VTE prophylaxis. In addition, it is unclear which treatment regimen (i.e., medication, dose, and timing) provides the best risk: benefit ratio in TBI patients. We reviewed all moderate-to-severe TBI patients admitted over a 5-year period to: (1) examine the occurrence of VTEs and their timing; (2) examine the symptomatic expansion of ICH while on VTE prophylaxis; and (3) compare the efficacy of two prophylactic agents: enoxaparin and dalteparin. Two-hundred eighty-seven patients were included. VTE prophylaxis was started 48-72 h post-trauma in all individuals who had no confounding coagulopathy, when two consecutive computed tomography (CT) scans revealed hemorrhage stability. VTEs occurred in 7.3% of treated patients, mostly within 2 weeks after trauma. Proximal VTEs occurred in 3.1% of treated patients. No significant difference in VTE rates was seen between enoxaparin (7.0%) and dalteparin (7.5%; p = 0.868). Moreover, the group treated with dalteparin was more severely injured (higher Injury Severity Score [p = 0.002]), had lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores (p = 0.003), and had more inferior vena cava (IVC) filters placed (p = 0.007). The two groups did not show significant differences in the development of VTE when controlled for ISS and IVC filters (p = 0.819). Importantly, only one patient suffered a symptomatic expansion of ICH while on VTE prophylaxis, at 15 days post-trauma. These results suggest that current regimens of VTE prophylaxis used in our TBI population provide a relatively high level of protection against VTEs, and an extremely low risk of expanding ICH. They also suggest that there was no difference in VTE between dalteparin- and enoxaparin-treated patients.

Ambulation Gains After Knee Surgery in Children With Arthrogryposis	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDICS			English	Article						arthrogryposis; knee flexion contractures; distal femoral extension	MULTIPLEX CONGENITA AMYOPLASIA; DISTAL ARTHROGRYPOSES; FLEXION CONTRACTURES; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; DEFORMITY; COMMON	Background: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a rare congenital disorder associated with multiple musculoskeletal contractures that causes substantial morbidity. Knee involvement is commonly seen among children with arthrogryposis, with flexion contracture of the knee being the most frequent knee deformity. Knee flexion contractures in the pediatric population are particularly debilitating as they affect ambulation. Treatment for knee flexion contractures requires numerous orthopaedic procedures and an extensive follow-up period. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of orthopaedic procedures, namely distal femoral supracondylar extension osteotomy and/or Ilizarov external fixator, on the ambulation status of children with knee flexion contracture and whether any functional gains are maintained at the latest follow-up. Methods: All children with arthrogryposis followed at our institution who had surgical correction for knee flexion contractures were included in this study. Fourteen patients were identified and their medical records were reviewed. The etiology for all patients was amyoplasia. The mean age at first surgery was 7.0 years (range, 2 to 16 y). The mean length of follow-up was 59.3 months (range, 12 to 117 mo). Contractures were treated with femoral extension osteotomy (n=8), Ilizarov external fixator (n=1), or both (n=5). Three patients earlier had posterior soft tissue releases, including hamstrings lengthenings, proximal gastrocnemius release, and release of posterior capsule. Results: Preoperatively, 11 patients were nonambulatory, 2 patients were household ambulators, and 1 patient walked with orthoses in the community. There was an average of 1.8 knee surgeries done per patient, namely distal femoral extension osteotomy and/or Ilizarov external fixator. At the latest follow-up, 8 patients were ambulatory with technical aids (orthosis, walker, braces, or rollator walker), 2 patients were household ambulators, 1 patient used a wheelchair but was independent for transfers, and 3 patients remained nonambulatory. The mean flexion contracture before the first surgery was 63.7 +/- 26.8 degrees. Postoperatively, the mean flexion contracture was 13.2 +/- 16.7 degrees. At the latest follow-up, the mean flexion contracture was 34.0 +/- 24.1 degrees. There were complications in 2 patients, including infected hardware which resolved with antibiotic treatment, and neurologic compromise which resolved on its own. Conclusions: Surgical correction of knee flexion deformities by distal femoral extension osteotomy and/or Ilizarov external fixator was effective in improving the ambulation status of children with arthrogryposis. At latest follow-up, the gradual loss of total arc of motion and the recurrence of knee flexion contractures did not limit the ambulatory gains achieved. Level of Evidence: IV, Case series.

The APEC scale focuses on the key role of impairment in body image construction, which requires cross-modal sensory integration through emotional communication with motor representations. Thus, the body image construction is associated simultaneously with spatial and temporal organization and allows the emergence of self- and others-representations. The use of the APEC scale, with its seven domains (expression of emotion in relationships, eye contact, body image, graphic productions, exploration of space and objects, time perception, and verbal language), underlines the importance in autistic disorder of anxieties related to body and spatial representations, and of impairment in the body ego construction which is closely linked to the emergence of individuation/separation processes. This study was conducted on 73 children and adolescents with autistic disorder. They were recruited in day care facilities where two caregivers independently gave their ratings based on their clinical observation on a daily basis during the same month. Analyses included assessing construct validity through correspondence analyses and inter-rater reliability using kappa coefficients. The APEC scale offers a reliable and validated psychodynamic assessment of interest for professionals (such as child psychiatrists, caregivers, therapists or teachers) and researchers working with children, adolescents and adults with autistic disorder, especially in the follow-up of their evolution. The APEC scale provides an approach at the interface of psychoanalysis and neuroscience, and is also of interest for clinical and developmental psychology. Using the APEC scale in a range of different practical and research settings will foster links between psychoanalytic perspectives and educational training for children with autistic disorder, and will contribute to the dialogue between psychoanalysis, neuroscience and psychology.

J	Guile, JM				Guile, Jean-Marc			Disentangling cognitive processes from neural activation and psychic mechanisms: The example of empathy	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-PARIS			English	Article						Empathy; Social cognition; Neuroscience; Psychoanalysis; Autism; Conduct disorder	SOCIAL COGNITION; AUTISM; PAIN; RECOGNITION; EXPERIENCE; DEFICITS; CHILD	Empathy processes can be explored within a three-level model distinguishing neuronal, cognitive and intra-psychic operating levels. Cognitive and intra-psychic processes need not to be collapsed. Neural systems involved in empathy are described through neuroimaging and event-related potential (ERP) studies. On the cognitive level, empathy is threefold: procedural, semantic and biographical. Automatically activated since birth, procedural empathy processes are deeply enrooted in visuo-motor response capacities and responsible for automatic mimicry. These processes might rely on a prior sensori-motor contagion system. Semantic empathy parallels language development and expresses connexion between words, meaning and emotion. Biographical emerges later in life and corresponds to the interweaving of personal experience with feelings and words, together with a capacity to bridge with the others' experiences. On the intra-psychic level, defence mechanisms as well as identification processes, depicted from a subjective and interpersonal standpoint, are corresponding, without being similar, to empathetic processes described in cognitive neuroscience studies. Studies on semantic empathy need to control for the participants biographical information and concomitant memory activation. The interface between cognitive and intra-psychic processes needs to be further investigated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Finite Element Modeling for Development and Optimization of a Bone Plate for Mandibular Fracture in Dogs	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DENTISTRY			English	Article							RECONSTRUCTION; REPAIR; WIRE	This study aimed to develop a plate to treat fractures of the mandibular body in dogs and to validate the project using finite elements and biomechanical essays. Mandible prototypes were produced with 10 oblique ventrorostral fractures (favorable) and 10 oblique ventrocaudal fractures (unfavorable). Three groups were established for each fracture type. Osteosynthesis with a pure titanium plate of double-arch geometry and blocked monocortical screws offree angulanon were used. The mechanical resistance of the prototype with unfavorable fracture was lower than that of the fcworable fracture. In both fractures, the deflection increased and the relative stiffness decreased proportionally to the diminishing screw number The finite element analysis validated this plate study, since the maximum tension concentration observed on the plate was lower than the resistance limit tension admitted by the titanium. In conclusion, the double-arch geometry plate fixed with blocked monocortical screws has sufficient resistance to stabilize oblique,fractures, without compromising mandibular dental or neurovascular structures.

The objective of this study was to use MRS to monitor the effect of minocycline treatment (200 mg/day) over a short period (6 weeks) on the brain metabolites in the precentral gyms and brainstem in newly diagnosed ALS patients. Methods: Ten ALS patients (not on riluzole treatment) were recruited and submitted to single-voxel proton MRS longitudinal examinations (1) before minocycline treatment, (2) 3 weeks and (3) 6 weeks after initiation of treatment. Results: Results did not show the expected decrease of N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) in the precentral gyms, and an increased NAA/Cr ratio in the brainstem suggested neuronal recovery. The myo-inositol (mI)/Cr ratio was unchanged in the precentral gyms, but increased in the brainstem, indicating a glial reaction. Conclusions: MRS results suggest that minocycline treatment could be beneficial in the early stages of ALS. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The high sequence identity of Erk4 and Erk3 proteins and the similar organization of their genes imply that the two protein kinases are paralogs. Recently, we have shown that Erk3 function is essential for neonatal survival and critical for the establishment of fetal growth potential and pulmonary function. To investigate the specific functions of Erk4, we have generated mice with a targeted disruption of the Mapk4 gene. We show that Erk4-deficient mice are viable and fertile and exhibit no gross morphological or physiological anomalies. Loss of Erk4 is not compensated by changes in Erk3 expression or activity during embryogenesis or in adult tissues. We further demonstrate that additional loss of Erk4 does not exacerbate the fetal growth restriction and pulmonary immaturity phenotypes of Erk3(-/-) mice and does not compromise the viability of Erk3(+/-) neonates. Interestingly, behavioral phenotyping revealed that Erk4-deficient mice manifest depression-like behavior in the forced-swimming test. Our analysis indicates that the MAP kinase Erk4 is dispensable for mouse embryonic development and reveals that Erk3 and Erk4 have acquired specialized functions through evolutionary diversification.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene, may be therapeutic; however, interventional trials of antioxidants have provided mixed results, with some showing deleterious consequences. It is thus crucial that we consider the implications of trial design and execution, and further investigation of cellular pro-and antioxidant mechanisms is critical. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species, in experimental models as well as in humans, and have demonstrated beneficial cardiovascular effects. Polyphenols and antioxidants contained in foods and beverages may also be cardioprotective. Recent studies suggest that the judicious development of antioxidant agents may provide an effective approach to quench oxidative stress in tissues and improve cardiovascular health.

The IMAGEN study is the first multicentre genetic-neuroimaging study aimed at identifying the genetic and neurobiological basis of individual variability in impulsivity, reinforcer sensitivity and emotional reactivity, and determining their predictive value for the development of frequent psychiatric disorders. Comprehensive behavioural and neuropsychological characterization, functional and structural neuroimaging and genome-wide association analyses of 2000 14-year-old adolescents are combined with functional genetics in animal and human models. Results will be validated in 1000 adolescents from the Canadian Saguenay Youth Study. The sample will be followed up longitudinally at the age of 16 years to investigate the predictive value of genetics and intermediate phenotypes for the development of frequent psychiatric disorders. This review describes the strategies the IMAGEN consortium used to meet the challenges posed by large-scale multicentre imaging-genomics investigations. We provide detailed methods and Standard Operating Procedures that we hope will be helpful for the design of future studies. These include standardization of the clinical, psychometric and neuroimaging-acquisition protocols, development of a central database for efficient analyses of large multimodal data sets and new analytic approaches to large-scale genetic neuroimaging analyses.

One of its main functions is the transport of the substrate cholesterol into mitochondria, a prerequisite for steroid synthesis. TSPO expression may constitute a biomarker of brain inflammation and reactive gliosis that could be monitored by using TSPO ligands as neuroimaging agents. Moreover, initial clinical trials have indicated that TSPO ligands might be valuable in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. This Review focuses on the biology and pathophysiology of TSPO and the potential of currently available TSPO ligands for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Surface Expression of Precursor N-cadherin Promotes Tumor Cell Invasion	NEOPLASIA			English	Article							PROPROTEIN CONVERTASES; CARCINOMA-CELLS; MELANOMA-CELLS; ADHESION MOLECULES; CANCER-CELLS; TRANSENDOTHELIAL MIGRATION; PROHORMONE CONVERTASES; EXTRACELLULAR DOMAIN; SIGNALING PATHWAY; MEDIATED ADHESION	The expression of N-cadherin (NCAD) has been shown to correlate with increased tumor cell motility and metastasis. However, NCAD-mediated adhesion is a robust phenomenon and therefore seems to be inconsistent with the "release" from intercellular adhesion required for invasion. We show that in the most invasive melanoma and brain tumor cells, altered posttranslational processing results in abundant nonadhesive precursor N-cadherin (proNCAD) at the cell surface, although total NCAD levels remain constant. We demonstrate that aberrantly processed proNCAD promotes cell migration and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, in human tumor specimens, we find high levels of proNCAD as well, supporting an overall conclusion that proNCAD and mature NCAD coexist on these tumor cell surfaces and that it is the ratio between these functionally antagonistic moieties that directly correlates with invasion potential. Our work provides insight into what may be a widespread mechanism for invasion and metastasis and challenges the current dogma of the functional roles played by classic cadherins in tumor progression.

Up-regulation of caveolin-1 and blood-brain barrier breakdown are attenuated by N-acetylcysteine in thiamine deficiency	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Thiamine deficiency; N-Acetylcysteine; Oxidative stress; Blood-brain barrier; Caveolin-1; Wernicke's encephalopathy	NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; FREE-RADICAL PRODUCTION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; WERNICKES-ENCEPHALOPATHY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; IN-VIVO; MICROVASCULAR PERMEABILITY; PREMATURE SENESCENCE	Wernicke's encephalopathy is a cerebral metabolic disorder caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency (TD). Neuropathologic consequences of TD include region-selective neuronal cell loss and blood-brain barrier (BOB) breakdown. Caveolin-1 is involved in the regulation of tight junction proteins and BBB permeability, and is modulated by oxidative stress, a feature of vulnerable brain regions in TD. We hypothesized that TD-related oxidative stress alters BBB integrity via induction of the caveolin-1 pathway. TD was induced in C57BL6 mice by treatment with a thiamine-deficient diet and administration of the thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine, in the absence or presence of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). A significant and focal increase in both caveolin-1 gene and protein expression was detected in the thalamus of thiamine-deficient mice, concomitant with IgG extravasation. Reduction of oxidative stress by NAC, as shown by normalization of reduced glutathione levels and attenuation of endothelial heme oxygenase-1 and nitric oxide synthase expression, resulted in prevention of the up-regulation of caveolin-1 in TD. Normalization of caveolin-1 levels by NAC was accompanied by a reduction in BBB breakdown, indicated by decreased IgG extravasation, normalization of occludin levels and prevention of matrix metalloproteinase-9 up-regulation. These findings demonstrate a role for caveolin-1 in TD pathogenesis, and suggest that oxidative stress contributes to BOB alterations in TD via modulation of this pathway. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These two findings have never been investigated using the same physiological measures. We recorded the BOLD response using fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electrophysiology (EEG), while subjects encoded visual stimuli from a single hemifield of a balanced display. The EEG showed an SPCN. However, no SPCN-like activation was observed in the BOLD signals. The BOLD response in parietal cortex remained bilateral, even after unilateral encoding of the stimuli, but MEG showed both bilateral and contralateral activations, each likely reflecting a sub portion of the neuronal populations participating in the maintenance of information in VSTM. Contrary to the assumption that BOLD, EEG, and MEG responses - that were each linked to the maintenance of information in VSTM - are markers of the same neuronal processes, our findings suggest that each technique reveals a somewhat distinct but overlapping neural signature of the mechanisms supporting visual short-term memory.

Group differences in anterior hippocampal volume and in the retrieval of spatial and temporal context memory in healthy young versus older adults	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Aging; Hippocampus; Volumetry; Memory retrieval; Item recognition; Contextualization	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RELATIONAL MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY	The ability to retrieve temporal and spatial context information from memory declines with healthy aging. The hippocampus (HC) has been shown to be associated with successful encoding and retrieval of spatio-temporal context, versus item recognition information (Davachi, Mitchell, & Wagner, 2003; Nadel, Samsonovich, Ryan, & Moscovitch, 2000; Ross & Slotnick, 2008). Aging has been linked to volume reduction in the HC (Bouchard, Malykhin, Martin, Hanstock, Emery, Fisher, & Camicioli, 2008; Malykhin, Bouchard, Camicioli, & Coupland, 2008; Raz et al., 2005). As such, age-associated reductions in anterior HC volume may contribute to the context memory deficits observed in older adults. In the current MRI study we investigated whether item recognition, spatial context and temporal context memory performance would be predicted by regional volumes in HC head (HH), body (HB) and tail (HT) volumes, using within group multiple regression analyses in a sample of 19 healthy young (mean age 24.3) and 20 older adults (mean age 67.7). We further examined between age-group differences in the volumes of the same HC sub-regions. Multiple regression analyses revealed that in younger adults both spatial and temporal context retrieval performance was predicted by anterior HC volume. Older age was associated with significant volume reductions in HH and HB, but not HT; and with reduced ability to retrieve spatial and temporal contextual details from episodic memory. However, HC volumes did not predict context retrieval performance in older adults. We conclude that individual differences in anterior, not posterior, HC volumes predict context memory performance in young adults. With age there may be a posterior-to-anterior shift from using HC-related processes, due to HC volume loss, to employing the prefrontal cortex to aid in the performance of cognitively demanding context memory tasks. However, due to concomitant changes in the prefrontal system with age, there are limits to compensation in the aging brain. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lateral radiographs showed the presence of compression fractures of the L1 to L2 vertebral bodies. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed an intravertebral vacuum sign suggestive of ischemic fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large right retroperitoneal mass infiltrating the vertebral bodies and entering the spinal canal from L1 to L4 neural foramina. A fluid sign usually suggestive of acute compression fractures was seen near the superior end plate of the L1 vertebral body in our patient. Computed tomography-guided biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma. However, the primary site could not be found despite several investigations. It is usually thought that the primary tumor spreads to the spine through the valve-less Batson's plexus or by direct arterial seeding into vertebral bodies. A paravertebral primary tumor such as a lymphoma, a primary tumor from the lungs, or a renal cell carcinoma can potentially infiltrate the vertebral bodies and enter the spinal canal through the neural foramen. But a large retroperitoneal metastatic mass from an unknown primary adenocarcinoma is a rare condition. No reports exist in the literature on a metastatic mass infiltrating vertebral bodies and then entering the epidural space through the 3 consecutive neural foramen. Thus, the pathogenesis of metastatic adenocarcinomas, particularly when the primary site is unknown, is not completely understood and can give a varied radiological presentation.

J	Pitcher, MH; Cervero, F				Pitcher, Mark H.; Cervero, Fernando			Role of the NKCC1 co-transporter in sensitization of spinal nociceptive neurons	PAIN			English	Article						NKCC1; Capsaicin; Primary afferent depolarization; Wide dynamic range; Nociceptor specific; In vivo electrophysiology	ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; CATION-CHLORIDE COTRANSPORTERS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; DORSAL-ROOT; NA+-K+-2CL(-) COTRANSPORTER; PAIN MECHANISMS; AMINO-ACIDS; RAT SKIN; CAPSAICIN; CORD	The Na(+), K(+), 2Cl(-) co-transporter type 1 (NKCC1) plays a pivotal role in hyperalgesia associated with inflammatory stimuli. NKCC1 contributes to maintain high [Cl(-)](i) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons which cause primary afferent depolarization (PAD) when GABA(A) receptors are activated. Enhanced GABA-induced depolarization, through increased NKCC1 activity, has been hypothesized to produce orthodromic spike activity of sufficient intensity to account for touch-induced pain. In the present study, we investigate this hypothesis using in vivo electrophysiology on rat dorsal horn neurons; the effects of spinal blockade of NKCC1 on intraplantar capsaicin-induced sensitization of dorsal horn neurons were examined. Single wide dynamic range (WDR) and nociceptive specific (NS) neuron activity in the dorsal horn was recorded using glass microelectrodes in anesthetized rats. Dorsal horn neurons with a receptive field on the plantar surface of the hindpaw were studied. Neuronal responses to mechanical stimuli (brush, von Frey filaments) were recorded ten minutes before intraplantar injection of 0.3 ml 0.1% capsaicin (CAP), 40 min after CAP and 15 min after local application of the NKCC1 blocker bumetanide (BTD; 500 mu M) on the spinal cord. After CAP, low and high threshold stimulation of the cutaneous receptive field produced a significant enhancement in spike frequency over pre-CAP values in both WDR and NS neurons. Spinal BTD application reduced the spike frequency to baseline levels as well as attenuated the CAP-induced increases in background activity. Our data support the hypothesis that NKCC1 plays an important role in the sensitization of dorsal horn neurons following a peripheral inflammatory insult.

However, there is increasing interest in utilizing early brain MRI while hypothermia is still being provided to rapidly understand the degree of brain injury and possibly refine neuroprotective strategies. This study was designed to assess whether therapeutic hypothermia can be maintained while performing a brain MRI. Twenty MRI scans were obtained in 12 asphyxiated neonates while they were treated with hypothermia. The median difference between esophageal temperature on NICU departure and return was 0.1A degrees C (range: -0.8 to 0.8A degrees C). We found that therapeutic hypothermia can be safely and reproducibly maintained during a brain MRI. Hypothermia treatment should not prevent obtaining an early brain MRI if clinically indicated.

Differential regulation of female sexual behaviour by dopamine agonists in the medial preoptic area	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Appetitive; Consummatory; Hormone; Hypothalamus; Solicitations; Lordosis; Apomorphine; SKF 38393; Quinpirole	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; HORMONE-PRIMED RATS; VAGINOCERVICAL STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; LORDOSIS REFLEX; RECEPTIVITY; LESIONS; HYPOTHALAMUS; FACILITATION	The medial preoptic area (mPOA) is a brain region critical in the control of male sexual behaviour, and the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) plays an important role within it. However, both the roles of DA and the mPOA in female sexual behaviour are not fully understood, with few studies producing consistent data. The present study examined the function of DA within the mPOA on the full cascade of female sexual behaviour. Ovariectomized female rats were bilaterally cannulated into the mPOA and partially hormonally primed with estradiol benzoate (EB). Different doses of a nonselective DA receptor agonist, and selective DA D1 and D2 receptor agonists (apomorphine, SKF 38393 and quinpirole, respectively) were infused bilaterally to the mPOA. Copulatory behaviour was then immediately tested over a period of 30 min in a bilevel chamber with a sexually experienced male. Precopulatory behaviours were increased in females following infusions of a low dose (0.25 mu g) of apomorphine and both a low (0.05 mu g) and a high dose (0.2 mu g) of quinpirole. However, hops and/or darts were decreased following infusion of a low dose (0.05 mu g) of SKF 38393. These results suggest that the ratio of DA D1/D2 activity within the mPOA of female rats is critical for the expression of precopulatory behaviours, and may work with other brain areas responsible for stimulating lordosis to control the timing of female sexual behaviour.

These reactions are important for daily activities, reproduction, and survival. In the sea lamprey, mating occurs after ovulated females are attracted to spawning sites by male sex pheromones. The ubiquity and reliability of olfactory-motor behavioral responses in vertebrates suggest tight coupling between the olfactory system and brain areas controlling movements. However, the circuitry and the underlying cellular neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using lamprey brain preparations, and electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and tract tracing experiments, we describe the neural substrate responsible for transforming an olfactory input into a locomotor output. We found that olfactory stimulation with naturally occurring odors and pheromones induced large excitatory responses in reticulospinal cells, the command neurons for locomotion. We have also identified the anatomy and physiology of this circuit. The olfactory input was relayed in the medial part of the olfactory bulb, in the posterior tuberculum, in the mesencephalic locomotor region, to finally reach reticulospinal cells in the hindbrain. Activation of this olfactory-motor pathway generated rhythmic ventral root discharges and swimming movements. Our study bridges the gap between behavior and cellular neural mechanisms in vertebrates, identifying a specific subsystem within the CNS, dedicated to producing motor responses to olfactory inputs.

Sleep before and after MI was investigated in the first experiment. In a parallel experiment, 2 weeks after MI, we quantified brainstem cholinergic neurons known to control paradoxical sleep (PS). Measurements and Results: Data were obtained from 28 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 350-375 g and maintained under a 12-12 light-dark cycle in 2 experiments on 16 and 12 rats, respectively. The 16 animals in the first experiment were implanted with chronic electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) electrodes. A week after surgery, these animals were habituated for 2 days to the recording equipment, and baseline sleep was charted for 24 h. The next morning, MI was induced in 8 rats by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery for 40 min. The remaining 8 rats served as sham-operated controls. Sleep was recorded again 2 weeks after MI. The number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons was counted in the second, parallel experiment on 6 MI and 6 sham rats. Compared to the sham controls, MI rats displayed longer latency to sleep onset, shorter latency to paradoxical sleep (PS), and curtailed PS duration. The number of ChAT-positive neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT) area of MI rats was significantly decreased compared to the sham controls, while the number of laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) cholinergic neurons was not different. Conclusion: Acute MI is accompanied, within 2 weeks, by PS-specific insomnia that can be explained, at least partly, by a specific loss of cholinergic neurons in an area known to control PS.

Sixty-two patients with cancer were assessed. All received interventions by the OT within the CNR program. The following activity domains: (1) self-care, (2) productivity, and (3) leisure that were addressed during appointments with the OT were recorded following each visit. Seven categories of interventions were predetermined and their use was recorded using a checklist. Descriptive statistics were conducted and revealed that 36% of the therapist's time was spent assessing patients' functional capacity while 64% was spent providing interventions. The OT's interventions addressed leisure and exercise (54%), productive activities such as housework and paid employment (32%), and basic activities of daily living (14%). The frequency of specific interventions provided were as follows: 40% in teaching of energy conservation and activity management techniques, 33% in goal setting/support and counseling, 9% in cognitive retraining/stimulation, 6% in communication with community agencies, and 4% in teaching of joint and bone protection techniques, help with management of neuropathies, and education on scar management respectively. It is suggested that OTs practicing in oncology use a variety of interventions to better address productive and leisure activities. The data suggests that limitations in these areas were more prevalent than in self-care activities. Further study is needed to examine OT interventions in oncology.

We have identified 12 series reporting on a total of 480 patients treated to a tumor bed following microsurgery. These cases fall into 3 paradigms: adjuvant radiosurgery as an alternative to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), radiosurgery as an intensification of adjuvant WBRT and adjuvant radiosurgery for patients having failed prior WBRT. For these paradigms the reported crude local control rates are 79%, 92% and 95%, respectively. The procedure appears well tolerate with approximately a 5% risk of late radiation necrosis. Prospective data is lagging behind clinical practice and plans for prospective trials are discussed.

This mutation has also been associated with in vitro resistance to peramivir, but few clinical cases have been described to date. Using allele-specific real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for the H275Y mutation, we were able to identify resistant H1N1 in a hematopoietic cell transplant recipient receiving intravenous peramivir therapy, and through serial testing we determined the molecular evolution of resistance. This case demonstrates that an H275Y mutant population can emerge early and replicate in vivo under peramivir antiviral pressure to become the major viral population.

Allele-Selective Inhibition of Mutant Huntingtin Expression with Antisense Oligonucleotides Targeting the Expanded CAG Repeat	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							LOCKED NUCLEIC-ACID; SHOW IMPROVED POTENCY; DISEASE GENE; TRINUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; NUCLEOSIDE ANALOGS; RNA INTERFERENCE; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; APOLIPOPROTEIN-B; MOUSE MODEL; STABILITY	Huntington's disease (HD) is a currently incurable neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Therapeutic approaches include selectively inhibiting the expression of the mutated HTT allele while conserving function of the normal allele. We have evaluated a series of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeted to the expanded CAG repeat within HTT mRNA for their ability to selectively inhibit expression of mutant HTT protein. Several ASOs incorporating a variety of modifications, including bridged nucleic acids and phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages, exhibited allele-selective silencing in patient-derived fibroblasts. Allele-selective ASOs did not affect the expression of other CAG repeat-containing genes and selectivity was observed in cell lines containing minimal CAG repeat lengths representative of most HD patients. Allele-selective ASOs left HTT mRNA intact and did not support ribonuclease H activity in vitro. We observed cooperative binding of multiple ASO molecules to CAG repeat-containing HTT mRNA transcripts in vitro. These results are consistent with a mechanism involving inhibition at the level of translation. ASOs targeted to the CAG repeat of HTT provide a starting point for the development of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics that can inhibit gene expression with allelic discrimination in patients with HD.

One element of the supporting evidence is that cocaine, like other drugs that increase dopaminergic neurotransmission, powerfully potentiates reward seeking. We analyze this phenomenon from a novel perspective, introducing a new conceptual framework and new methodology for determining the stage(s) of neural processing at which drugs, lesions and physiological manipulations act to influence reward-seeking behavior. Cocaine strongly boosts the proclivity of rats to work for rewarding electrical brain stimulation. We show that the conventional conceptual framework and methods do not distinguish between three conflicting accounts of how the drug produces this effect: increased sensitivity of brain reward circuitry, increased gain, or decreased subjective reward costs. Sensitivity determines the stimulation strength required to produce a reward of a given intensity (a measure analogous to the K-M of an enzyme) whereas gain determines the maximum intensity attainable (a measure analogous to the v(max) of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction). To distinguish sensitivity changes from the other determinants, we measured and modeled reward seeking as a function of both stimulation strength and opportunity cost. The principal effect of cocaine was a two-fourfold increase in willingness to pay for the electrical reward, an effect consistent with increased gain or decreased subjective cost. This finding challenges the long-standing view that cocaine increases the sensitivity of brain reward circuitry. We discuss the implications of the results and the analytic approach for theories of how dopaminergic neurons and other diffuse modulatory brain systems contribute to reward pursuit, and we explore the implications of the conceptual framework for the study of natural rewards, drug reward, and mood.

To determine whether abnormal brain responses during negative emotion appear early in life in S allele carriers, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain activity during a transient state of sadness in children carrying the S allele (S group) or homozygous for the L allele (L group). Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal changes were measured while subjects viewed blocks of neutral film excerpts and sad film excerpts. During the sad condition (relative to the neutral condition), there was significantly greater activation in the S group compared to the L group in brain regions known to be involved in normal sadness and major depression. Given that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism has been associated with mood disorders, it is plausible that the abnormal pattern of regional brain activity detected here, in children carrying the S allele, increases susceptibility to emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms.

Although cholinergic and GABAergic MS-DBB neurons are known to modulate hippocampal activity, the role of recently described glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons is unknown. Here, we examined the electrophysiological properties of glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons and tested whether they provide a functional synaptic input to the hippocampus. To visualize the glutamatergic neurons, we used MS-DBB slices from transgenic mice in which the green fluorescent protein is expressed specifically by vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive neurons and characterized their properties using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. For assessing the function of the glutamatergic projection, we used an in vitro septohippocampal preparation, electrically stimulated the fornix or chemically activated the MS-DBB using NMDA microinfusions and recorded postsynaptic responses in CA3 pyramidal cells. We found that glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons as a population display a highly heterogeneous set of firing patterns including fast-, cluster-, burst-, and slow-firing. Remarkably, a significant proportion exhibited fast-firing properties, prominent Ih, and rhythmic spontaneous firing at theta frequencies similar to those found in GABAergic MS-DBB neurons. Activation of the MS-DBB led to fast, AMPA receptor-mediated glutamatergic responses in CA3 pyramidal cells. These results describe for the first time the electrophysiological signatures of glutamatergic MS-DBB neurons, their rhythmic firing properties, and their capacity to drive hippocampal principal neurons. Our findings suggest that the glutamatergic septohippocampal pathway may play an important role in hippocampal theta oscillations and relevant cognitive functions.

Patterns of binocular interaction were categorized (facilitation, averaging or suppression) by comparing monocular and binocular responses. Quantitative and continuous indexes of binocular integration were also calculated (binocular response minus the sum of monocular responses). Results indicated that patterns of interaction were not optimal to account for stereoscopic performance. The latter was, however, best explained by binocular integration indexes. This study shows evidence of predicting binocular vision based on a novel index that allows continuous quantification of binocular transient-visual evoked potential responses.

TLN-4601 peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR/TSPO) binding properties do not mediate apoptosis but confer tumor-specific accumulation	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; Translocator protein; TLN-4601; Apoptosis; Tumor accumulation	MITOCHONDRIAL PERMEABILITY TRANSITION; COLORECTAL-CANCER CELLS; CYTOCHROME-C RELEASE; HUMAN BREAST-CANCER; BRAIN-TUMORS; INDUCE APOPTOSIS; AFFINITY BINDING; PBR EXPRESSION; CYCLE ARREST; IN-VITRO	TLN-4601 is a farnesylated dibenzodiazepinone isolated from Micromonospora sp. with an antiproliferative effect on several human cancer cell lines. Although the mechanism of action of TLN-4601 is unknown, our earlier work indicated that TLN-4601 binds the PBR (peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; more recently known as the translocator protein or TSPO), an 18 kDa protein associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) pore. While the exact function of the PBR remains a matter of debate, it has been implicated in heme and steroid synthesis, cellular growth and differentiation, oxygen consumption and apoptosis. Using the Jurkat immortalized T-lymphocyte cell line, documented to have negligible PBR expression, and Jurkat cells stably transfected with a human PBR cDNA, the present study demonstrates that TLN-4601 induces apoptosis independently of PBR expression. As PBRs are overexpressed in brain tumors compared to normal brain, we examined if TLN-4601 would preferentially accumulate in tumors using an intra-cerebral tumor model. Our results demonstrate the ability of TLN-4601 to effectively bind the PBR in vivo as determined by competitive binding assay and receptor occupancy. Analysis of TLN-4601 tissue and plasma indicated that TLN-4601 preferentially accumulates in the tumor. Indeed, drug levels were 200-fold higher in the tumor compared to the normal brain. TLN-4601 accumulation in the tumor (176 mu g/g) was also significant compared to liver (24.8 mu g/g; 7-fold) and plasma (16.2 mu g/mL; 11-fold). Taken together our data indicate that while PBR binding does not mediate cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, PBR binding may allow for the specific accumulation of TLN-4601 in PBR positive tumors.

It is of central interest to understand both the phenomenon and molecular mechanisms of local translation using new tools and approaches. Caged compounds can, in principle, be used as tools to investigate local translation since optical activation of bioactive molecules can achieve both spatial and temporal resolution on the micron scale and on the order of seconds or less, respectively. Successful caging of bioactive molecules requires the identification of key functional groups in appropriate molecules and the introduction of a suitable caging moiety. Here we present the design, synthesis and testing of a collection of three caged compounds: anisomycin caged with a diethylaminocoumarin moiety and dimethoxynitrobenzyl caged versions of 4E-BP and rapamycin. Whereas caged anisomycin can be used to control general translation, caged 4E-BP serves as a probe of cap-dependent translation initiation and caged rapamycin serves a probe of the role of mTORC1 in translation initiation. In vitro translation assays demonstrate that these caging strategies, in combination with the aforementioned compounds, are effective for optical control making it likely that such strategies can successfully employed in the study of local translation in living systems.

EAE can follow either relapsing-remitting (RR) or chronic (CH) courses, yet the factors responsible for differentially inducing these forms of disease remain largely unknown. Proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in EAE, and signaling by these cytokines can be negatively regulated by the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 protein (SOCS1). We assessed if differential expression of SOCS1 could contribute to the clinical course of RR and CH forms of EAE induced in the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) using the same myelin antigen (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein). We show that SOCS1 mRNA levels are significantly elevated in the spinal cord in early stages of both RR- and CH-EAE. SOCS1 protein is highly expressed in immune cells in EAE lesions in the spinal cord, with expression predominantly localized within macrophages. Importantly, the number of Mac-1(+) macrophages expressing SOCS1 at the peak stage of RR disease is three-fold greater than in CH-EAE. Furthermore, the macrophage effector molecule iNOS, whose expression is regulated by SOCS1, is significantly reduced at the peak of RR-versus CH-EAE. Finally, the administration of a SOCS1-mimetic peptide reduces disease severity in the CH-EAE model. Thus, the differential expression of SOCS1 may contribute to the development of RR and CH forms of EAE. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Expression and lysosomal targeting of CLN7, a major facilitator superfamily transporter associated with variant late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							CATHEPSIN-D DEFICIENCY; DISEASE PROTEIN CLN3; BATTEN-DISEASE; TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; MEMBRANE-PROTEIN; CYTOPLASMIC TAIL; DILEUCINE MOTIF; SORTING MOTIF; MUTANT MICE	Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) constitute a group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders resulting from mutations in at least eight different genes. Mutations in the most recently identified NCL gene, MFSD8/CLN7, underlie a variant of late-infantile NCL (vLINCL). The MFSD8/CLN7 gene encodes a polytopic protein with unknown function, which shares homology with ion-coupled membrane transporters. In this study, we confirmed the lysosomal localization of the native CLN7 protein. This localization of CLN7 is not impaired by the presence of pathogenic missense mutations or after genetic ablation of the N-glycans. Expression of chimeric and full-length constructs showed that lysosomal targeting of CLN7 is mainly determined by an N-terminal dileucine motif, which specifically binds to the heterotetrameric adaptor AP-1 in vitro. We also show that CLN7 mRNA is more abundant in neurons than astrocytes and microglia, and that it is expressed throughout rat brain, with increased levels in the granular layer of cerebellum and hippocampal pyramidal cells. Interestingly, this cellular and regional distribution is in good agreement with the autofluorescent lysosomal storage and cell loss patterns found in brains from CLN7-defective patients.

The cytokine IL-15 is pivotal in the maintenance and activation of CD8 T lymphocytes, a prominent lymphocyte population found in MS lesions. We investigated whether astrocytes are a functional source of IL-15 sufficient to enhance CD8 T lymphocyte responses and whether they provide IL-15 in the inflamed CNS of patients with MS. We observed that human astrocytes in primary cultures increased surface IL-15 levels upon activation with combinations of proinflammatory cytokines. Expanded human myelin autoreactive CD8 T lymphocytes cultured with such activated astrocytes displayed elevated lytic enzyme content, NKG2D expression, and Ag-specific cytotoxicity. These functional enhancements were abrogated by anti-IL-15-blocking Abs. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue sections obtained from patients with MS demonstrated colocalization for IL-15 and the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein within white matter lesions. The majority of astrocytes (80-90%) present in demyelinating MS lesions expressed IL-15, whereas few astrocytes in normal control brain sections had detectable IL-15. IL-15 could be detected in the majority of Iba-1-expressing microglia in the control sections, albeit in lower numbers when compared with microglia/macrophages in MS lesions. Furthermore, infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes in MS lesions were in close proximity to IL-15-expressing cells. Astrocyte production of IL-15 resulting in the activation of CD8 T lymphocytes ascribes a role for these cells as contributors to the exacerbation of tissue damage during MS pathogenesis.

We examined phenotypic and genetic associations of cortisol levels with the thickness of prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex regions, and with hippocampal volume in a sample of 388 middle-aged male twins who were 5159 years old. Small but significant negative phenotypic associations were found between cortisol levels and the thickness of left dorsolateral (superior frontal gyrus, left rostral middle frontal gyrus) and ventrolateral (pars opercularis, pars triangularis, pars orbitalis) prefrontal regions, and right dorsolateral (superior frontal gyrus) and medial orbital frontal cortex. Most of the associations remained significant after adjusting for general cognitive ability, cardiovascular risk factors, and depression. Bivariate genetic analyses suggested that some of the associations were primarily accounted for by shared genetic influences; that is, some of the genes that tend to result in increased cortisol levels also tend to result in reduced prefrontal cortical thickness. Aging has been associated with reduced efficiency of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function, frontal lobe shrinkage, and increases in health problems, but our present data do not allow us to determine the direction of effects. Moreover, the degree or the direction of the observed associations and the extent of their shared genetic underpinnings may well change as these individuals age. Longitudinal assessments are underway to elucidate the direction of the associations and the genetic underpinnings of longitudinal phenotypes for changes in cortisol and brain morphology.

Lateralized genetic and environmental influences on human brain morphology of 8-year-old twins	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; Pediatric twin; Cortical thickness; Genetic effect; Structural equation modeling	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; HUMAN CORTICAL SURFACE; SPATIAL NORMALIZATION; BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS; MONOZYGOTIC TWINS; MORPHOMETRIC-ANALYSIS; PLANUM TEMPORALE; PEDIATRIC TWINS; MRI DATA	It has been increasing rapidly interest in understanding genetic effects on brain structure and function in recent years. In this study, we examined the genetic and environmental influences on the variation in cortical thickness and specific tissue volumes in a large cohort of 8-year-old healthy twins. The present study can provide a better estimation of the genetic and environmental effects by virtue of the homogeneously aged pediatric twin pairs with a similar growing environment. We found that common environmental factors contributed significantly to the variations of the right lateral ventricle (36%) and corpus callosum (36%) volumes while genetic factors accounted for most of the phenotypic variance in other brain tissue volumes. In the case of cortical thickness, several regions in the left hemisphere showed statistically significant additive genetic factors, including the middle and inferior frontal gyri, lateral fronto-orbital and occipitotemporal gyri, pars opercularis, planum temporale, precentral and parahippocampal gyri and the medial region of the primary somatosensory cortex. Relatively high common environmental influence (>50%) was observed in the right anterior cingulate cortex and insula.

J	Zagami, CJ; Stifani, S				Zagami, Chrissandra J.; Stifani, Stefano			Molecular Characterization of the Mouse Superior Lateral Parabrachial Nucleus through Expression of the Transcription Factor Runx1	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; FOOD-INTAKE; BRAIN-STEM; SPINOPARABRACHIAL PATHWAY; REGULATES DEVELOPMENT; NOCICEPTIVE PROCESSES; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SENSORY NEURONS; C-FOS; RAT	Background: The ability to precisely identify separate neuronal populations is essential to the understanding of the development and function of different brain structures. This necessity is particularly evident in regions such as the brainstem, where the anatomy is quite complex and little is known about the identity, origin, and function of a number of distinct nuclei due to the lack of specific cellular markers. In this regard, the gene encoding the transcription factor Runx1 has emerged as a specific marker of restricted neuronal populations in the murine central and peripheral nervous systems. The aim of this study was to precisely characterize the expression of Runx1 in the developing and postnatal mouse brainstem. Methods and Principal Findings: Anatomical and immunohistochemical studies were used to characterize mouse Runx1 expression in the brainstem. It is shown here that Runx1 is expressed in a restricted population of neurons located in the dorsolateral rostral hindbrain. These neurons define a structure that is ventromedial to the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, dorsocaudal to the medial paralemniscal nucleus and rostral to the cerebellum. Runx1 expression in these cells is first observed at approximately gestational day 12.5, persists into the adult brain, and is lost in knockout mice lacking the transcription factor Atoh1, an important regulator of the development of neuronal lineages of the rhombic lip. Runx1-expressing neurons in the rostral hindbrain produce cholecystokinin and also co-express members of the Groucho/Transducin-like Enhancer of split protein family. Conclusion: Based on the anatomical and molecular characteristics of the Runx1-expressing cells in the rostral hindbrain, we propose that Runx1 expression in this region of the mouse brain defines the superior lateral parabrachial nucleus.

Growing Together and Growing Apart: Regional and Sex Differences in the Lifespan Developmental Trajectories of Functional Homotopy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DIFFUSION TENSOR TRACTOGRAPHY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; HUMAN BRAIN; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; BIMANUAL COORDINATION; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DISCOVERY SCIENCE	Functional homotopy, the high degree of synchrony in spontaneous activity between geometrically corresponding interhemispheric (i.e., homotopic) regions, is a fundamental characteristic of the intrinsic functional architecture of the brain. However, despite its prominence, the lifespan development of the homotopic resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the human brain is rarely directly examined in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Here, we systematically investigated age-related changes in homotopic RSFC in 214 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 years. We observed marked age-related changes in homotopic RSFC with regionally specific developmental trajectories of varying levels of complexity. Sensorimotor regions tended to show increasing homotopic RSFC, whereas higher-order processing regions showed decreasing connectivity (i.e., increasing segregation) with age. More complex maturational curves were also detected, with regions such as the insula and lingual gyrus exhibiting quadratic trajectories and the superior frontal gyrus and putamen exhibiting cubic trajectories. Sex-related differences in the developmental trajectory of functional homotopy were detected within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9 and 46) and amygdala. Evidence of robust developmental effects in homotopic RSFC across the lifespan should serve to motivate studies of the physiological mechanisms underlying functional homotopy in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

While neuropathic pain evoked by injury associated with nerve lesion has an involvement of glia/immune cells, inflammatory hyperalgesia has an exaggerated sensitization mediated by local and circulating immune mediators. To better understand the contribution of central nervous system (CNS) glial cells in these different pathological conditions, in this study we sought to characterize functional phenotypes of glial cells in response to trigeminal nerve injury (loose ligation of the mental branch), infection (subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide-LPS) and to sterile inflammation (subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant-CFA) on the lower lip. Each of the three insults triggered a specific pattern of mechanical allodynia. In parallel with changes in sensory response, CNS glial cells reacted distinctively to the challenges. Following ligation of the mental nerve, both microglia and astrocytes in the trigeminal nuclear complex were highly activated, more prominent in the principal sensory nucleus (Pr5) and subnucleus caudalis (Sp5C) area. Microglial response was initiated early (days 3-14), followed by delayed astrocytes activation (days 7-28). Although the temporal profile of microglial and astrocyte reaction corresponded respectively to the initiation and chronic stage of neuropathic pain, these activated glial cells exhibited a low profile of cytokine expression. Local injection of LPS in the lower lip skin also triggered a microglial reaction in the brain, which started in the circumventricular organs (CVOs) at 5 hours post-injection and diffused progressively into the brain parenchyma at 48 hours. This LPS-induced microglial reaction was accompanied by a robust induction of I kappa B-alpha mRNA and pro-inflammatory cytokines within the CVOs. However, LPS induced microglial activation did not specifically occur along the pain signaling pathway. In contrast, CFA injection led to minor microglial morphological changes and an induction of I kappa B-alpha mRNA in the CVO regions; a significant increase in IL-1 beta and IL-6 mRNA started only at 48 hours post-injection, when the induced pain-related behavior started to resolve. Our detailed analysis of CNS glial response clearly revealed that both nerve injury and oro-facial infection/inflammation induced CNS glial activation, but in a completely different pattern, which suggests a remarkable plasticity of glial cells in response to dynamic changes in their microenvironment and different potential involvement of this non-neuronal cell population in pathological pain development.

Microglial activation is a major contributor to neurologic dysfunction in thiamine deficiency	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Wernicke encephalopathy; Inflammation; Microglia; Vitamin B-1; Neurologic dysfunction; Oxidative stress	EXPERIMENTAL WERNICKES-ENCEPHALOPATHY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SELECTIVE VULNERABILITY; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTERS; OXIDATIVE-METABOLISM; INDUCED APOPTOSIS; N-ACETYLCYSTEINE; MILD IMPAIRMENT; GENE-EXPRESSION; MEDIAL THALAMUS	In Wernicke's encephalopathy and thiamine deficiency (TD), the cause of this brain disorder, development of inflammation is an important aspect of the disease process. How this pathological mechanism relates to the neurologic impairment associated with TD, however, remains unclear. A key feature of the inflammatory process is the activation of microglia. In the present study, we evaluated the role of microglial activation in the pathophysiology of TD by examining the relationship between levels of CD11b/c and CD68, two proteins associated with microglial activation, and neurological dysfunction under conditions of TD. Rats with TD showed large increases in expression of both CD11b/c and CD68 in the vulnerable thalamus and inferior colliculus, with no change in mRNA levels in the relatively non-vulnerable frontal cortex. These alterations in CD11b/c and CD68 expression were reflected in dramatic upregulation of both proteins by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical methods. Co-treatment of rats with TD and the anti-inflammatory drug minocycline prevented microglial activation, and onset of neurological changes, including loss of righting reflex, was delayed by approximately 39 h, compared to animals with TD alone. In addition, co-treatment of rats with TD and N-acetylcysteine prevented the increase in CD11b/c and CD68, but did not alter the onset of neurological impairment. These results suggest that microglial activation plays a role in the development of neurological impairment in TD and possibly Wernicke's encephalopathy, and that while development of oxidative stress may be involved in microglial activation, the basis of this neurologic dysfunction is likely to be multifactorial in nature.

However, the underlying mechanisms for dendritic Na+ overload and the selective dendritic injury remain poorly understood. Our current study demonstrates that activation of NHE-1 (Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1) in dendrites presents a major pathway for Na+ overload. Neuronal dendrites exhibited higher pH(i) regulation rates than soma as a result of a larger surface area/volume ratio. Following a 2-h oxygen glucose deprivation and a 1-h reoxygenation, NHE-1 activity was increased by similar to 70-200% in dendrites. This elevation depended on activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase. Moreover, stimulation of NHE-1 caused dendritic Na-i(+) accumulation, swelling, and a concurrent loss of Ca-i(2+) homeostasis. The Ca-i(2+) overload in dendrites preceded the changes in soma. Inhibition of NHE-1 or the reverse mode of Na+/Ca2+ exchange prevented these changes. Mitochondrial membrane potential in dendrites depolarized 40 min earlier than soma following oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Blocking NHE-1 activity not only attenuated loss of dendritic mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis but also preserved dendritic membrane integrity. Taken together, our study demonstrates that NHE-1-mediated Na+ entry and subsequent Na+/Ca2+ exchange activation contribute to the selective dendritic vulnerability to in vitro ischemia.

For example, in developing nervous systems Hh signaling is required for the normal differentiation of neural progenitors into mature neurons. The molecular signaling mechanism underlying the function of Hh is not fully understood. In Drosophila, Ihog (Interference hedgehog) and Boi (Brother of Ihog) are related transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) with orthologs in vertebrates. Members of this IgSF subfamily have been shown to bind Hh and promote pathway activation but their exact role in the Hh signaling pathway has remained elusive. To better understand this role in vivo, we generated loss-of-function mutations of the ihog and boi genes, and investigated their effects in developing eye and wing imaginal discs. Results: While mutation of either ihog or boi alone had no discernible effect on imaginal tissues, cells in the developing eye disc that were mutant for both ihog and boi failed to activate the Hh pathway, causing severe disruption of photoreceptor differentiation in the retina. In the anterior compartment of the developing wing disc, where different concentrations of the Hh morphogen elicit distinct cellular responses, cells mutant for both ihog and boi failed to activate responses at either high or low thresholds of Hh signaling. They also lost their affinity for neighboring cells and aberrantly sorted out from the anterior compartment of the wing disc into posterior territory. We found that ihog and boi are required for the accumulation of the essential Hh signaling mediator Smoothened (Smo) in Hh-responsive cells, providing evidence that Ihog and Boi act upstream of Smo in the Hh signaling pathway. Conclusions: The consequences of boi; ihog mutations for eye development, neural differentiation and wing patterning phenocopy those of smo mutations and uncover an essential role for Ihog and Boi in the Hh signaling pathway.

Adolescents can actively use music listening as a coping resource to maintain emotional stability and this is likely to influence their personality development. The aim of this study was to examine if interactions between 3 styles of coping by music listening (emotion oriented, problem oriented, and avoidance/disengagement oriented) could predict changes in adolescent neuroticism. This 2-wave longitudinal study followed 336 adolescent girls and boys over a 6-month period. In adolescents combining high neuroticism (baseline) and low avoidance-oriented coping, problem-oriented coping predicted lower neuroticism. In adolescents combining high neuroticism (baseline) with high avoidance-oriented coping, problem-oriented coping predicted higher neuroticism. In adolescent girls presenting high avoidance-oriented coping, emotion-oriented coping predicted higher neuroticism. Overall, avoidance/disengagement coping by music listening may represent a short-term risk/precipitating factor of increasing neuroticism in adolescence.

However, the search for specific genes has been hampered by inconsistent findings, partly due to genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. We focused on lithium-responsive bipolar patients, a subgroup thought to be more homogeneous and conducted a multistage study including an initial linkage study followed up by fine mapping and gene expression. Our sample consisted of 36 families (275 genotyped individuals, 132 affected) recruited through probands who were responders to long-term lithium treatment. We conducted a genome-wide scan with 811 microsatellite markers followed by fine mapping. Gene expression studies of candidate regions were conducted on six post-mortem prefrontal brain regions of 20 individuals (8 BD and 12 controls). We identified regions 3p25, 3p14 and 14q11 as showing the highest genome-wide linkage signal (LOD 2.53, 2.04 and 3.19, respectively). Fine mapping provided further support for 3p25, while only modest support was found in the other two regions. We identified a group of synaptic, mitochondrial and apoptotic genes with altered expression patterns in BD. Analysis of an independent microarray dataset supported the implication of synapse-related and mitochondrial genes in BD. In conclusion, using two complementary strategies, we found evidence of linkage to lithium-responsive BD on 3p25, 3p14 and 14q11 as well as significantly dysregulated genes on these regions suggesting altered synaptic and mitochondrial function in BD.

Porosity prediction from seismic attributes of the Ordovician Trenton-Black River groups, Rochester field, southern Ontario	AAPG BULLETIN			English	Article							HYDROTHERMAL DOLOMITE RESERVOIRS; SATURATED ROCKS; ATTENUATION; FREQUENCY; BANDWIDTH	This article integrates three-dimensional (3-D) seismic attributes and log data to determine porosity distribution of the Ordovician Trenton-Black River groups within the Rochester field, southern Ontario. The rocks are composed of tight limestone, parts of which were dolomitized to form porous reservoir rock. Previous studies of the Trenton-Black River dolomite reservoirs have indicated a close relationship between faulting and reservoir development, but few published studies have attempted to examine these relationships using 3-D seismic data. This study explores the stratigraphy and structure of the Rochester fault-related dolomite reservoir using 3-D seismic data and neural networks to predict porosity. By predicting porosity using seismic attributes, vertical and lateral distributions of porosity that can be used to guide development and exploration drilling for optimal hydrocarbon recovery were obtained. The sites of highest porosity were found to be along and within the fault zones. Faults extending from the basement into overlying Paleozoic rocks are composed of several short-plane, vertical, and subvertical fault segments. However, some of these faults appear to have originated and died within the Paleozoic rocks; they cannot be traced to the basement because of little or no offset where they penetrate the basement. Although the five identified attributes are considered important in exploration for fault-related dolomite reservoirs, the single most important attribute to employ is the amplitude envelope because the other attributes are mathematically related to it. Furthermore, the sags that are seen in the Rochester field are due to the combined effects of low-velocity push-down and faulting. Methods and results presented in this study can be used to explore and develop fault-related dolomite reservoirs elsewhere in similar geologic settings.	[Ogiesoba, O.

ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article						herpes zoster ophthalmicus; prognosis; treatment; risk factors; primary care	POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; NATURAL-HISTORY; ORAL ACYCLOVIR; COMPLICATIONS; RISK	Objectives: The objective was to assess the predictive value of clinical signs and symptoms of herpes zoster (HZO) for development of moderate to severe eye disease. Methods: This was a prospective cohort multicenter study of 54 patients referred to the ophthalmology service after presenting to the emergency department (ED) or primary care clinic with a zosteriform rash of less than 10 days' duration. Upon referral to ophthalmology, easily assessable clinical signs and symptoms were documented. A complete ocular exam was then performed. Patients were followed for 2 months. Results: Twenty-three patients (43%) developed moderate to severe disease as defined by corneal or intraocular involvement. Eye redness and rash in the supratrochlear nerve distribution had a statistically significant association with clinically relevant eye disease. All 23 patients who developed moderate to severe eye disease presented with a red eye. Hutchinson's sign (nasociliary nerve involvement) was not predictive of clinically relevant eye disease. Conclusions: Eye redness was 100% sensitive for predicting moderate to severe eye disease in this sample of patients and should necessitate immediate referral for ophthalmologic assessment. Patients lacking eye redness, even with a positive Hutchinson's sign, may not require immediate specialist consultation. All patients not being referred require careful instructions to seek further care should they develop any concerning eye symptoms such as redness, pain, photophobia, or visual disturbance.

Vagal control of pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 299: E786-E793, 2010. First published August 17, 2010; doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.00202.2010.-The physiological mechanisms that preserve pancreatic beta-cell mass (BCM) are not fully understood. Although the regulation of islet function by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is well established, its potential roles in BCM homeostasis and compensatory growth have not been adequately explored. The parasympathetic vagal branch of the ANS serves to facilitate gastrointestinal function, metabolism, and pancreatic islet regulation of glucose homeostasis, including insulin secretion. Given the functional importance of the vagus nerve and its branches to the liver, gut, and pancreas in control of digestion, motility, feeding behavior, and glucose metabolism, it may also play a role in BCM regulation. We have begun to examine the potential roles of the parasympathetic nervous system in short-term BCM maintenance by performing a selective bilateral celiac branch-vagus nerve transection (CVX) in normal Sprague-Dawley rats. CVX resulted in no detectable effects on basic metabolic parameters or food intake through 1 wk postsurgery. Although there were no differences in BCM or apoptosis in this 1-wk time frame, beta-cell proliferation was reduced 50% in the CVX rats, correlating with a marked reduction in activated protein kinase B/Akt. Unexpectedly, acinar proliferation was increased 50% in these rats. These data suggest that the ANS, via the vagus nerve, contributes to the regulation of BCM maintenance at the level of cell proliferation and may also mediate the drive for enhanced growth under physiological conditions when insulin requirements have increased. Furthermore, the disparate effects of CVX on beta-cell and acinar cells suggest that the endocrine and exocrine pancreas respond to different neural signals in regard to mass homeostasis.

We set out to determine whether these projections are affected by levodopa treatment in a way that would favor the occurrence of dyskinesia. Methods: As an index of terminal serotonin innervation density, we measured radioligand binding to the plasma membrane serotonin transporter (SERT) in levodopa-treated dyskinetic and nondyskinetic subjects, using brain tissue from both rat and monkey models of Parkinson disease as well as parkinsonian patients. In addition, striatel tissue from dyskinetic rats was used for morphological and ultrastructural analyses of serotonin axon terminals, and for studies of stimulated [(3)H]dopamine release. Results: Across all conditions examined, striatal levels of SERT radioligand binding were significantly elevated in dyskinetic subjects compared to nondyskinetic cases. In the rat striatum, dyskinesiogenic levodopa treatment had induced sprouting of serotonin axon varicosities having a relatively high synaptic incidence. This response was associated with increased depolarization-induced [(3)H]dopamine release and with a stronger release potentiation by brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Interpretation: This study provides the first evidence that L-dopa treatment induces sprouting of serotonin axon terminals, with an increased incidence of synaptic contacts, and a larger activity-dependent potentiation of dopamine release in the dopamine-denervated striatum. Treatment-induced plasticity of the serotonin innervation may therefore represent a previously unappreciated cause of altered dopamine dynamics. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms by which L-dopa pharmacotherapy predisposes to dyskinesia, and for defining biomarkers of motor complications in Parkinsons disease.

Cortisol Awakening Response and Hippocampal Volume: Vulnerability for Major Depressive Disorder?	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Cortisol awakening response; hippocampus; manual segmentation; subclinical depression; vulnerability	WAKING SALIVARY CORTISOL; STRESS; METAANALYSIS; YOUNG; BRAIN; MRI; AMYGDALA; ANXIETY; STATE; RISK	Background: Major depressive disorder is associated with dysregulated basal cortisol levels and small hippocampal (HC) volume. However, it is still debated whether these phenomena are a consequence of the illness or whether they may represent a vulnerability marker existing before the illness onset. Here, we aimed to examine this notion of vulnerability by assessing whether abnormalities in basal cortisol secretion and HC volumes are already present in a sample of healthy young adults who showed varying levels of depressive tendencies, but at subclinical levels. Methods: We recruited healthy young men and women from the local university. On the basis of depression scores derived from standard questionnaires, three groups were formed: a control group (n = 27), a subclinical group (n = 23), and a high-risk subclinical group (n = 9). The participants underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan and collected saliva samples for the assessment of diurnal cortisol levels. Results: Both the subclinical and the high-risk subclinical group failed to show a significant increase in cortisol levels after awakening. The high-risk subclinical group also showed a lower area-under-the-curve increase of cortisol levels after awakening compared with control subjects. In addition, this group also had smaller total HC volume compared with control subjects. Conclusions: The findings from this subclinical sample suggest that dysregulated cortisol awakening response and small HC volume may constitute vulnerability factors for major depressive disorder. Further investigations are needed to discern the mechanisms that may underlie these phenomena.

The A(2)B star polymers were constructed on a core with orthogonal functionalities that facilitated the performance of "click" chemistry followed by ring-opening polymerization. These star polymers assemble into spherical micelles into which NIM can be easily loaded by the co-solvent evaporation method. The micelles obtained from the star polymer PEG775(2)-PCL5800 showed NIM encapsulation efficiency of up to 78 wt% at a feed weight ratio of 5.0%. The loading efficiency of the micelles was dependent on the length of the PCL arm in the A(2)B miktoarm polymers. Aqueous solubility of NIM was increased by similar to 200 fold via micellar encapsulation. The in vitro release of NIM from the micelles was found to occur at a much slower rate than from its solution. Lipopolysaccharide induced nitric oxide production in N9 microglia cells was reduced in the presence of micelle-encapsulated NIM, as well as in the presence of micelles alone. The treatment of microglia with micelle-encapsulated NIM reduced the release of TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. These results suggest that NIM-loaded miktoarm micelles could be useful in the treatment of neuroinflammation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The propositions made under these three paradigms have not been systematically reviewed collectively, and as such, there is no single-point synthesis of this clinically relevant body of evidence and somewhat disparate findings. Our comprehensive search strategy yielded 22 papers. Under each paradigm, the role of orthoses with different design features including combinations of posting, moulding and density was analysed. Where possible, data have been pooled to provide an increased level of confidence in findings. The main findings in the kinematic paradigm were that posted non-moulded orthoses systematically reduced peak rearfoot eversion (2.12 degrees (95% CI 0.72 to 3.53)) and tibial internal rotation (1.33 degrees (0.12 to 2.53)) in non-injured cohorts. In the shock attenuation paradigm, it was found that non-posted moulded and posted moulded orthoses produced large reductions in loading rate and vertical impact force when compared with a control and to a posted non-moulded orthosis. The neuromotor control paradigm seems to be the least conclusive in its outcome. Based on our review, this paper concludes with rudimentary guidelines for the prescription of orthosis, that sports medicine practitioners may use in their clinical decision-making process. The need for further research focusing on the role of injury, particularly in neuromotor control modification and long-term adaptation to orthoses, was highlighted.

Observations on the Ethical and Social Aspects of Disorders of Consciousness	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review							PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE; DETERMINING BRAIN-DEATH; LIFE DECISION-MAKING; MEDICAL ASPECTS; COMA; INJURY; CARE; END; VARIABILITY; GUIDELINES	The care of chronically unconscious patients raises vexing medical, ethical, and social questions concerning diagnosis, prognosis, communication with family members, and decision making, including the withdrawal of life support. We provide updates on major controversies surrounding disorders of consciousness. Issues such as withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration which had been considered "settled" by many in the medical, legal and ethical communities have resurfaced under the pressure of social groups and religious authorities. Some assumptions about the level of awareness and the prognosis of vegetative state and minimal conscious patients are questioned by advances in clinical care because of insights produced by neuroscience research techniques, particularly functional neuroimaging. Both the clinical and neuroscience dimensions of disorders of consciousness raise complex issues such as resource allocation and high levels of diagnostic inaccuracies (at least, for the vegetative state). We conclude by highlighting areas needing further research and collaboration.

To provide a more accurate assessment of the prevalence of TBI, episodes of care included visits to the emergency department (ED), as well as admissions to hospital. Mechanisms of injury for overall episodes were also investigated. Methods: Traumatic brain injury cases from fiscal years 2002/03-2006/07 were identified by means of ICD-10 codes. Data were collected from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System and the Discharge Abstract Database. Results: The rate of hospitalization was highest for elderly persons over 75 years-of-age. Males generally had higher rates for both hospitalizations and episodes of care than did females. The inclusion of ED visits to hospitalizations had the greatest impact on the rates of TBI in the youngest age groups. Episodes of care for TBI were greatest in youth under the age of 14 and elderly over the age of 85. Falls (41.6%) and being struck by or against an object (31.1%) were the most frequent causes for a TBI. Conclusions: The study provides estimates for TBI from the only Canadian province that has systematically captured ED visits in a national registry. It shows the importance of tracking ED visits, in addition to hospitalizations, to capture the burden of TBI on the health care system. Prevention strategies should include information on ED visits, particularly for those at younger ages.

Familial amyloid precursor protein mutants cause caspase-6-dependent but amyloid beta-peptide-independent neuronal degeneration in primary human neuron cultures	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Article						amyloid precursor protein; caspase-6; neurodegeneration; amyloid beta-peptide	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; A-BETA; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; CASPASE-6 ACTIVATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; AXONAL-TRANSPORT; MOUSE MODEL; PC12 CELLS; IN-VIVO; APOPTOSIS	Although familial Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated autosomal dominant mutants have been extensively studied, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration induced by these mutants in AD. Wild-type, Swedish or London amyloid precursor protein (APP) transfection in primary human neurons induced neuritic beading, in which several co-expressed proteins, such as enhanced green fluorescent protein, red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tau and RFP-ubiquitin, accumulated. APP-induced neuritic beading was dependent on caspase-6 (Casp6), because it was inhibited with 5 mu M z-VEID-fmk or with dominant-negative Casp6. Neuritic beading was independent from APP-mediated amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) production, because the APPM596V (APP(MV)) mutant, which cannot generate A beta, still induced Casp6-dependent neuritic beading. However, the beaded neurons underwent Casp6-and A beta-dependent cell death. These results indicate that overexpression of wild-type or mutant APP causes Casp6-dependent but A beta-independent neuritic degeneration in human neurons. Because Casp6 is activated early in AD and is involved in axonal degeneration, these results suggest that the inhibition of Casp6 may represent an efficient early intervention against familial forms of AD. Furthermore, these results indicate that removing A beta without inhibiting Casp6 may have little effect in preventing the progressive dementia associated with sporadic or familial AD.

Receptor tyrosine phosphatase sigma (RPTP sigma) regulates, p250GAP, a novel substrate that attenuates Rac signaling	CELLULAR SIGNALLING			English	Article						Yeast-two-hybrid; RPTP sigma; Cytoskeleton; Rac GTPase; GAP	GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; PTP-SIGMA; RHO-FAMILY; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; TRAPPING SYSTEM; MICE LACKING; AXON GROWTH; N-CADHERIN; LAR; IDENTIFICATION	Cumulative evidence supports an important role for RPTP sigma in the development of the nervous system and nerve regeneration. However, the signaling mechanisms regulated by RPTP sigma remain largely unknown and the identification of RPTP sigma substrate(s) and binding partners is essential to understanding its mechanisms of action. We employed a modified yeast-two-hybrid approach, the yeast substrate-trapping system, to identify new substrates and interacting partners of RPTP sigma. The binding proteins RFTP delta, Liprin alpha 4, p130Cas and Trio were found to interact with RPTP sigma in the yeast system independently of tyrosine phosphorylation. Importantly, using the trapping mutant of RPTP sigma we identified p250GAP as a novel substrate and RPTP sigma displayed its phosphatase specificity toward p250GAP in vitro. In the mammalian expression system, the trapping mutant of RPTP sigma recognized p250GAP as its physiological substrate in the presence of active Fyn, suggesting that the interaction of the two proteins is primarily dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, p250GAP activity increased in the presence of RPTP sigma leading to attenuated Rac activity. Overexpression of p250GAP and RPTP sigma inhibited axonal outgrowth in differentiated PC12 cells. Cumulative evidence implicates that RPTP sigma modulates the actin cytoskeleton by regulating Rac GTPase activity through p250GAP. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that RPTP sigma modulates Rac dependent activity through regulating a novel substrate, p250GAP.

To investigate the functional roles, we have cloned the cDNA sequences encoding two candidate zebrafish PC5 convertases (designated as PCSK5.1 and PCSK5.2) co-orthologous to the single PC5 encoding gene (PCSK5) found in mammals. Both display syntenic correspondence to the human PCSK5 gene. Overall gene architecture has been conserved across species. While PC5.1 mRNA expression is very discrete within the otic vesicle and lateral line neuromasts, PC5.2 transcripts are more ubiquitously expressed within the central nervous system together with specific localization in various organs including liver, intestine, and otic vesicle. Zebrafish PC5.1-deficient embryos display abnormal neuromast deposition within the lateral line system and lack a normal touch response, consistent with the known sensory role that the lateral line plays in spatial awareness and sensing the environment.

The work from my laboratory described in this review was based on many experiments by Levine and coworkers demonstrating that the quantity and quality of maternal milk and of maternal-infant contact influence different aspects of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity in the neonate. We have extended this work by showing that maternal high-fat feeding during the prenatal and lactational period blunts stress responsiveness in neonatal pups, in part mediated by increased circulating leptin levels in the offspring. The blunting of stress responses during this specific neonatal period might be beneficial to prevent the negative effects of exaggerated glucocorticoid secretion on the developing brain. In line with Levine's previous work, we found that maternal licking of the pups reduced stress responsiveness and inflammation in pups subjected to modest repeated pain during the first weeks of life and that it also blunted adult sensitivity to thermal pain. These studies have important implications for human infants as mechanisms aimed at reducing stress responsiveness can be considered protective to the developing brain from exaggerated and untimely neuroendocrine and sympathetic stimulation. Non-invasive interventions targeted at maternal nutrition and maternal care are relatively easy to implement and might have a significant effect on the health outcome of the offspring, particularly in a vulnerable population of term and pre-term babies.

"Breast is best": The evidence	EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Breastfeeding; Programming; Cognitive development; Obesity; Allergy; Asthma; Randomized trial	LARGE RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; PUBLISHED EVIDENCE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; LATER LIFE; METAANALYSIS; RISK; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; ASTHMA	Although the benefits of breastfeeding in reducing morbidity and mortality from gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, and (in preterm infants) necrotizing enterocolitis are well-established, long-term health effects are more controversial. The evidence is conflicting concerning the "programming" effect of breastfeeding in protecting against child obesity. hyperlipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and atopic disease. Accelerated neurocognitive development has been associated with breastfeeding in many studies, although doubts remain about the potential for residual confounding due to cognitive and behavioural differences between mothers who breastfeed (or those who breastfeed for a longer duration or more exclusively) and those who do not. Most of this paper will summarize the methods and results of a large, cluster-randomized trial of a breastfeeding promotion intervention in the Republic of Belarus. Its experimental design and intention-to-treat analysis have yielded important findings bearing on several of these longer-term health and developmental outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we report the crystal structures of effector caspase 6 (CASP6) zymogen and N-Acetyl-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp-al-inhibited CASP6. Both of these forms of CASP6 have a dimeric structure, and in CASP6 zymogen the intersubunit cleavage site (190)TEVD(193) is well structured and inserts into the active site. This positions residue Asp 193 to be easily attacked by the catalytic residue Cys 163. We demonstrate biochemically that intramolecular cleavage at Asp 193 is a prerequisite for CASP6 self-activation and that this activation mechanism is dependent on the length of the L2 loop. Our results indicate that CASP6 can be activated and regulated through intramolecular self-cleavage.

Chronic treatment with DA receptor agonists or antagonists is often used in pharmacotherapy, but the consequences of these treatments on DA neuron function are unclear. It was recently demonstrated that chronic D2 autoreceptor (D2R) activation in DA neurons decreases DA release and inhibits synapse formation. Given that DA neurons can establish synapses that release glutamate in addition to DA, we evaluated the synapse specificity of the functional and structural plasticity induced by chronic D2R activation. We show that chronic activation of the D2R with quinpirole in vitro caused a parallel decrease in the number of dopaminergic and glutamatergic axon terminals. The capacity of DA neurons to synthesize DA was not altered, as indicated by the lack of change in protein kinase A-mediated Ser(40) phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. However, the spontaneous firing rate of DA neurons was decreased and was associated with altered intrinsic properties as revealed by a prolonged latency to first spike after release from hyperpolarization. Moreover, D2R function was decreased after its chronic activation. Our results demonstrate that chronic activation of the D2R induces a complex neuronal reorganization involving the inhibition of both DA and glutamate synapse formation and an alteration in electrical activity, but not in DA synthesis. A better understanding of D2R-induced morphological and functional long-term plasticity may lead to improved pharmacotherapy of DA-related neurological and psychiatric disorders.

However, its role in myelination of peripheral nerves remains undefined. Here we report that selective inhibitors of SLKs (PP2 and SU6656) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the accumulation of several myelin proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP), protein zero (P0) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAC) in rat Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglion neuron (SC-DRGN) co-cultures. Interestingly, SLK inhibition was insufficient to completely abrogate myelin synthesis, as removal of PP2 after several days of treatment permitted a partial recovery of myelin proteins expression. Furthermore, fewer and shorter myelinated segments formed in the continuous presence of PP2, although the myelin formed was normally compacted. PP2 also decreased the number of SCs expressing Krox-20, a master-regulatory transcription factor expressed by myelinating SCs, by 50%. These results were corroborated by selective knockdown of Fyn and Lyn kinases using siRNA. Extracellular matrix is important to SC differentiation and peripheral myelination. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we showed that addition of extracellular matrix extracts to SC-DRGN co-cultures resulted in the activation of ERK, Akt and p38 MAPK, three protein kinases involved in SC proliferation, differentiation and peripheral myelination. PP2 blocked the phosphorylation of all three kinases. Our results support a role for SLKs in the initiation of peripheral myelination via the activation of p38, Akt and ERK, which regulate Krox-20 expression and peripheral myelination.

Herein, we investigated the effects of a cytotoxic HIV-1 accessory protein, viral protein R (Vpr), on the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Host and viral gene expression was investigated in peripheral nerves from HIV-infected individuals and in HIV-infected human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Cytosolic calcium ([Ca(2+)]) fluxes and neuronal membrane responses were analyzed in cultured DRGs. Neurobehavioral responses and cytokine levels were assessed in a transgenic mouse model in which the vpr transgene was expressed in an immunodeficient background (vpr/RAG1(-/-)). Vpr transcripts and proteins were detected in peripheral nerves and DRGs from HIV-infected patients. Exposure of rat or human cultured DRG neurons to Vpr rapidly increased [Ca(2+)] and action potential frequency while increasing input resistance. HIV infection of human DRG cultures caused neurite retraction (P<0.05), accompanied by induction of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) transcripts (P<0.05). vpr/RAG1(-/-) mice expressed Vpr together with increased IFN-alpha (P<0.05) in the PNS and also exhibited mechanical allodynia, unlike their vpr/RAG1(-/-) littermates (P<0.05). Herein, Vpr caused DRG neuronal damage, likely through cytosolic calcium activation and cytokine perturbation, highlighting Vpr's contribution to HIV-associated peripheral neuropathy and ensuing neuropathic pain.-Acharjee, S., Noorbakhsh, S., Stemkowski, P.

This study indicates that such resistance can be overcome, at least partly, through the targeting of eEF1A elongation factor with narciclasine, an Amaryllidaceae isocarbostyril controlling plant growth. Narciclasine displays IC(50) growth inhibitory values between 30-100 nM in melanoma cell lines, irrespective of their levels of resistance to proapoptotic stimuli. Normal noncancerous cell lines are much less affected. At nontoxic doses, narciclasine also significantly improves (P=0.004) the survival of mice bearing metastatic apoptosis-resistant melanoma xeno-grafts in their brain. The eEF1A targeting with narciclasine (50 nM) leads to 1) marked actin cytoskeleton disorganization, resulting in cytokinesis impairment, and 2) protein synthesis impairment (elongation and initiation steps), whereas apoptosis is induced at higher doses only (>= 200 nM). In addition to molecular docking validation and identification of potential binding sites, we biochemically confirmed that narciclasine directly binds to human recombinant and yeast-purified eEF1A in a nanomolar range, but not to actin or elongation factor 2, and that 5 nM narciclasine is sufficient to impair eEF1A-related actin bundling activity. eEF1A is thus a potential target to combat melanomas regardless of their apoptosis-sensitivity, and this finding reconciles the pleiotropic cytostatic of narciclasine.-Van Goietsenoven, G., Hutton, J., Becker, J.-P., Lallemand, B., Robert, F., Lefranc, F., Pirker, C., Vandenbussche, G., Van Antwerpen, P., Evidente, A., Berger, W., Prevost, M., Pelletier, J., Kiss, R., Goss Kinzy, T., Kornienko, A., Mathieu, V.

Recent evidence indicates that the family of the NR4A orphan nuclear receptors, which are expressed in dopamine neurons and in dopaminoceptive brain areas, may play a role in dopamine-mediated effects. We have, therefore, analysed the association of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the three genes belonging to the NR4A orphan nuclear receptor family, NR4A1 (rs2603751, rs2701124), NR4A2 (rs12803, rs834835) and NR4A3 (rs1131339, rs1405209), with the degree of smoking in a sample of 204 unrelated schizophrenia patients, which included 126 smokers and 78 non-smokers. SNPs within the NR4A3 gene (rs1131339 and rs1405209) were significantly associated with heavy smoking in this cohort, using a stepwise analysis of the escalated number of cigarettes smoked per day (P = 0.008 and 0.006, respectively; satisfying the Nyholt significance threshold of 0.009, an adjustment for multiple testing). We then repeated the association analysis of the NR4A3 markers (rs1131339 and rs1405209) in a larger cohort of 319 patients with bipolar disorder, which included 167 smokers and 152 non-smokers. We have replicated the positive association with smoking of the NR4A3 SNP rs1131339 in this group (P = 0.04), providing an important confirmation of the involvement of the NR4A3 gene in nicotine addiction in patients with mental health disease, a population significantly at risk for nicotine addiction.

METHODS: A repeated-measures, within-subjects design was used, and 40 adult patients participated. Data collection was completed during 2 test periods: (1) while patients were awake, before the induction of anesthesia (first test period); and (2) after the induction of anesthesia, while patients remained under the effects of anesthesia (second test period). Each test period included a baseline, a tactile stimulus (skin disinfection), nociceptive stimuli (e.g., intravenous and arterial line insertions, sternal bone incision and thorax opening), and a postprocedure evaluation. RESULTS: Increased rSO(2) values (P < .001) were acquired during nociceptive procedures in both test periods. No significant associations were evident between rSO(2), pain behaviors, and the patient's self-report of pain intensity, but this may be attributable to a low range of variability. CONCLUSIONS: Although further research is needed in critically ill adult patients undergoing more painful procedures, the NIRS may become a promising technique for assessing pain.

Neurogenic syncope encompasses a variety of subtypes, including vasovagal, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and situational syncope. Exceptionally, neuroregulatory syncope may be induced by swallowing. 2 Herein, we report the case of a child with syncope and documented periprandial and postprandial complete atrioventricular (AV) block, and offer insights into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

Int Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Co	Evidence for CRHR1 in multiple sclerosis using supervised machine learning and meta-analysis in 12 566 individuals	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; IMMUNE-RELATED DISEASES; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; MAST-CELLS; HAPLOTYPE	The primary genetic risk factor in multiple sclerosis (MS) is the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele; however, much of the remaining genetic contribution to MS has yet to be elucidated. Several lines of evidence support a role for neuroendocrine system involvement in autoimmunity which may, in part, be genetically determined. Here, we comprehensively investigated variation within eight candidate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis genes and susceptibility to MS. A total of 326 SNPs were investigated in a discovery dataset of 1343 MS cases and 1379 healthy controls of European ancestry using a multi-analytical strategy. Random Forests, a supervised machine-learning algorithm, identified eight intronic SNPs within the corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor 1 or CRHR1 locus on 17q21.31 as important predictors of MS. On the basis of univariate analyses, six CRHR1 variants were associated with decreased risk for disease following a conservative correction for multiple tests. Independent replication was observed for CRHR1 in a large meta-analysis comprising 2624 MS cases and 7220 healthy controls of European ancestry. Results from a combined meta-analysis of all 3967 MS cases and 8599 controls provide strong evidence for the involvement of CRHR1 in MS. The strongest association was observed for rs242936 (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.74-0.90, P = 9.7 x 10(-5)). Replicated CRHR1 variants appear to exist on a single associated haplotype. Further investigation of mechanisms involved in HPA axis regulation and response to stress in MS pathogenesis is warranted.	[Briggs, Farren B.

The neural network (NN), trained with five different flight flutter cases, is validated using 11 other flight flutter test (FFT) data. A total of 16 FFT cases were obtained for all three flight regimes (subsonic, transonic, and supersonic) at Mach numbers ranging between 0.85 and 1.30 and at altitudes of between 5000 and 25 000 ft. The results obtained highlight the efficiency of the multilayer perceptron NN in model identification. Optimization of the NN requires mixing of two proprieties: the hidden layer size reduction and four-layered NN performances. This paper shows that a four-layer NN with only 16 neurons is enough to create an accurate model. The fit coefficients were higher than 92% for both the identification and the validation test data, thus demonstrating accuracy of the NN.

Data from studies in adults suggest that AI may occur during the acute phase of TBI, with potential negative effects in the management of these vulnerable patients. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and the characteristics of AI in the acute phase of pediatric TBI. Adrenal function was systematically evaluated in patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit following a TBI. Serial measurements of cortisol (9 samples) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were drawn from the second morning to the third morning post admission. Secondary AI was defined as all cortisols < 200 nmol/l (6 mu g/dl) with ACTH < 12 pmol/l. Twenty-eight patients (2-15 years old) were evaluated. Secondary AI occurred in ten (36%) patients. AI was more frequent in patients with intracranial hypertension (p < 0.05). Patients with AI required longer mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05), and a non-significant trend for a higher Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score (p = 0.09) and greater norepinephrine dose (p = 0.11) was observed. Secondary AI is frequent during the acute phase of pediatric TBI, particularly when intracranial hypertension is present. Systematic assessment of pituitary function after TBI appears to be essential. A randomized clinical trial is warranted to evaluate the benefits of hormonal replacement therapy in TBI patients with AI.

The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether a verbal planning impairment also characterizes adult ADHD. Methods: A cohort of 30 adult ADHD clients of a university psychological clinic are compared to 30 age-, education-, gender-, and IQ-matched persons recruited from the general population who did not have ADHD. The dependent measure is a set of 6 paper/pencil 10-item script generation tasks. Results: The findings reveal that the ADHD cohort was significantly impaired on the script task and the script task correlated significantly with severity of ADHD (CAARS index + WURS), whereas several neuropsychological measures of executive function (Stroop, COWA, Rey's Complex Figure, D2, CVLT, CPT-II) did not. Findings further showed that the script measure was weakly correlated with the other established neuropsychological measures of executive function (r < .46, shared variance of less than 21%). Conclusions: On the basis of the study findings, it is concluded that verbal planning measured with script generation tasks is distinctly impaired in clinically referred adult ADHD.

In this study, a population-based comprehensive cerebral palsy registry was used to identify children whose cerebral palsy could be attributed to a cerebral malformation. The clinical features of these children were then compared with other children with cerebral palsy. Children with cerebral palsy and cerebral malformation did not differ from those without in terms of the neurological subtype of cerebral palsy or its functional severity as measured by the Gross Motor Function Classification System. There was a difference in the number of cumulative comorbidities experienced by the children with cerebral malformation. In addition, children with cerebral malformation tended to be of greater gestational age and birth weight, or the product of a twin gestation. Children with cerebral palsy attributable to a cerebral malformation represent a distinct clinical pathologic entity with respect to predisposing clinical features and associated comorbidities.

Functional and anatomical connectivity of these circuits has begun to be analyzed. Imaging in patients suggests that chronic pain is associated with altered function and structural abnormalities in pain modulatory circuits. Moreover, biochemical alterations associated with chronic pain are being identified that provide information on cellular correlates as well as potential mechanisms of structural changes. Data from these brain imaging studies reinforce the idea that chronic pain leads to brain changes that could have functional significance.	[Bushnell, M.

In order to accomplish this goal, we utilized the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), an electrophysiological index of the maintenance of information in VSTM. We hypothesized that if mental rotation is accomplished by transforming a representation held in VSTM, then the duration that this representation is maintained in VSTM should be related to the degree to which the representation must be rotated to reach the desired orientation. Therefore, the SPCN should offset at progressively longer latencies as the degree of rotation required increases. We tested this prediction in two experiments utilizing rotated alphanumeric characters. Experiment 1 utilized a normal versus mirror discrimination task that is known to require mental rotation. Experiment 2 utilized a letter versus digit discrimination, a task that does not require mental rotation. In Experiment 1, the offset latency of the SPCN wave increased with increases in the angle of rotation of the target. This effect indicates that targets were maintained in VSTM for longer durations as the angle of rotation increased. Experiment 2 revealed that target orientation did not affect SPCN offset latency when subjects did not adopt a mental rotation strategy, confirming that the effects on the SPCN latency effects observed in Experiment 1 were not due to the mere presentation of rotated patterns. Thus, these two experiments provide clear evidence that mental rotation involves representations maintained in VSTM.

Serotonin mediates this behavioral change through the reversal of synaptic depression in sensory neurons (SNs). However, the 5HT receptors present in SNs and in particular, the receptor important for activation of protein kinase C (PKC) have not been fully identified. Using a recent genome assembly of Aplysia, we identified new receptors from the 5HT(2), 5HT(4), and 5HT(7) families. Using RT-PCR from isolated SNs, we found that three 5HT receptors, 5HT(1Apl(a)), 5HT(2Apl), and 5HT(7Apl) were expressed in SNs. These receptors were cloned and expressed in a heterologous system. In this system, 5HT(2Apl) could significantly translocate PKC Apl II in response to 5HT and this was blocked by pirenperone, a 5HT(2) receptor antagonist. Surprisingly, pirenperone did not block 5HT-mediated translocation of PKC Apl II in SNs, nor 5HT-mediated reversal of depression. Expression of 5HT(1Apl(a)) in SNs or genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases inhibited both PKC translocation and reversal of depression. These results suggest a non-canonical mechanism for the translocation of PKC Apl II in SNs.

It is unclear whether stress dysregulation is a heritable trait of suicide or how it might increase risk. We investigated stress reactivity of the autonomic nervous system and the HPA axis in suicide predisposition and characterized the effect of this dysregulation on neuropsychologic function. Methods: In this family-based study of first-degree relatives (n = 14) of suicide completers and matched controls with no family or personal history of suicidal behaviour (n = 14), participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). We used salivary alpha-amylase and cortisol levels to characterize stress reactivity and diurnal variation. We administered a series of neuropsychologic and executive function tests before and after the TSST. Results: Despite normal diurnal variation, relatives of suicide completers exhibited blunted cortisol and alpha-amylase TSST reactivity. Although there were no baseline differences in conceptual reasoning, sustained attention or executive function, the relatives of suicide completers did not improve on measures of inhibition upon repeated testing after TSST. Secondary analyses suggested that these effects were related to suicide vulnerability independent of major depression. Limitations: The sample size was small, and the design prevents us from disentangling our findings from the possible traumatic consequences of losing a relative by suicide. Conclusions: Blunted stress response may be a trait of suicide risk, and impairment of stress-induced executive function may contribute to suicide vulnerability.

An investigation of the relation between sibilant production and somatosensory and auditory acuity	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							COCHLEAR IMPLANT USERS; NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; 2-POINT DISCRIMINATION; SPEECH PRODUCTION; NORMAL-HEARING; SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; MOTOR EQUIVALENCE; VERTICAL-BAR; PERCEPTION; VOWEL	The relation between auditory acuity, somatosensory acuity and the magnitude of produced sibilant contrast was investigated with data from 18 participants. To measure auditory acuity, stimuli from a synthetic sibilant continuum ([s]-[integral]) were used in a four-interval, two-alternative forced choiceadaptive-staircase discrimination task. To measure somatosensory acuity, small plastic domes with grooves of different spacing were pressed against each participant's tongue tip and the participant was asked to identify one of four possible orientations of the grooves. Sibilant contrast magnitudes were estimated from productions of the words 'said,' 'shed,' 'sid,' and 'shid'. Multiple linear regression revealed a significant relation indicating that a combination of somatosensory and auditory acuity measures predicts produced acoustic contrast. When the participants were divided into high-and low-acuity groups based on their median somatosensory and auditory acuity measures, separate ANOVA analyses with sibilant contrast as the dependent variable yielded a significant main effect for each acuity group. These results provide evidence that sibilant productions have auditory as well as somatosensory goals and are consistent with prior results and the theoretical framework underlying the DIVA model of speech production.

The recent advances in use of reliable biomarkers of AD that provide in-vivo evidence of the disease has stimulated the development of new research criteria that reconceptualise the diagnosis around both a specific pattern of cognitive changes and structural/biological evidence of Alzheimer's pathology. This new diagnostic framework has stimulated debate about the definition of AD and related conditions. The potential for drugs to intercede in the pathogenic cascade of the disease adds some urgency to this debate. This paper by the International Working Group for New Research Criteria for the Diagnosis of AD aims to advance the scientific discussion by providing broader diagnostic coverage of the AD clinical spectrum and by proposing a common lexicon as a point of reference for the clinical and research communities. The cornerstone of this lexicon is to consider AD solely as a clinical and symptomatic entity that encompasses both predementia and dementia phases.

The ability to realize the potential of epigenetics in defining the causal pathways lying between environmental signals, transcriptional regulation and neural function will depend on moving beyond correlational studies focusing on individual epigenetic marks. Here we attempt to provide a conceptual framework for integrative research on nucleotide sequence, chromatin modifications, RNA signaling and their interactions in understanding experience-dependent phenotypic plasticity. Studies in genomic imprinting may serve as an existing model for such approaches.

We found that knockdown of the gene for atlastin (atl1) caused a severe decrease in larval mobility that was preceded by abnormal architecture of spinal motor axons and was associated with a substantial upregulation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. Overexpression analyses confirmed that atlastin inhibits BMP signaling. In primary cultures of zebrafish spinal neurons, Atlastin partially colocalized with type I BMP receptors in late endosomes distributed along neurites, which suggests that atlastin may regulate BMP receptor trafficking. Finally, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BMP signaling was sufficient to rescue the loss of mobility and spinal motor axon defects of atl1 morphants, emphasizing the importance of fine-tuning the balance of BMP signaling for vertebrate motor axon architecture and stability.

Molecular studies in HE brain reveal altered expression of genes coding for key astroglial proteins including early losses of expression of GFAP and the glutamate transporter EEAT-2 with concomitant increases of the astrocytic/microglial mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (MBR). Decreased expression of EAAT-2 results in decreased glutamate transport and impaired cycling of glutamate-glutamine between astrocytes and neurons, as well as increased extracellular glutamate, activation of the NMDA receptor-mediated cGMP-NO signal transduction pathway, and nitration of tyrosine residues on key astroglial proteins such as glutamine synthetase (GS) and the MBR. GS is uniquely responsible for the removal of excess ammonia in brain. Ammonia-induced activation of MBR in astrocytes and/or microglia results in stimulation of the synthesis of neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone with positive allosteric GABA-A receptor neuromodulatory properties. Allopregnanolone concentrations are increased up to 7-fold in HE brain. Attenuation of microglial activation by minocycline results in a delay in onset of HE and prevents brain edema in liver failure. Mild hypothermia is likewise beneficial in acute liver failure resulting in normalization of extracellular brain glutamate and prevention of oxidative/nitrosative stress in experimental animals with HE resulting from either ischemic or toxic liver injuries.

NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Glia as Neurotransmitter Sources and Sensors	AUG 29-SEP 01, 2009	Shenyang, PEOPLES R CHINA			Hepatic encephalopathy; Lactate; Ammonia	ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; MONOCARBOXYLATE TRANSPORTER MCT2; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID LACTATE; OXIDATIVE ENERGY SUBSTRATE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VIVO; ARTERIAL AMMONIA; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION	Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome which develops as a result of liver failure or disease. Increased concentrations of brain lactate (microdialysate, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue) are commonly measured in patients with HE induced by either acute or chronic liver failure. Whether an increase in brain lactate is a cause or a consequence of HE remains undetermined. A rise in cerebral lactate may occur due to (1) blood-borne lactate (hyperlactataemia) crossing the blood-brain barrier, (2) increased glycolysis due to energy failure or impairment and (3) increased lactate production/release or decreased lactate utilization/uptake. This review explores the different reasons for lactate accumulation in the brain during liver failure and describes the possible roles of lactate in the pathogenesis of HE. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased activity of Na, K-ATPase could be the result of enhanced production of ouabain-like compounds, since cultured rat astrocytes react to prolonged exposure to a high concentration of ouabain with an upregulation of the Na, K-ATPase alpha(1) isoform (Hosoi et al., 1997). However, unlike astrocytes in brain in vivo and mouse primary cultures, cultured rat astrocytes do not express the astrocyte-specific alpha(2) isoform, which shows a higher affinity for ouabain (EC50 similar to 0.1 mu M) than the alpha(1) isoform (EC50 similar to 10 mu M). In the present study we have investigated (i) effects of ammonia on mRNA and protein expression of alpha(1) and alpha(2) isoforms in primary cultures of mouse astrocytes; (ii) effects of hyperammonia obtained by urease injection on mRNA and protein expression of alpha(1) and alpha(2) isoforrns in the brain in vivo; and (iii) effect on observed upregulation of gene expression of AG1478, an inhibitor of the EGF receptor-tyrosine kinase, PP1, an inhibitor of Src, and GM6001, an inhibitor of Zn2+-dependent metalloproteinases in the cultured cells. It was established that alpha(2) mRNA and protein expression, but not alpha(1) expression, was upregulated in cultured astrocytes by 1-4 days of exposure to 3 or 5 mM ammonia and that similar upregulation, contrasted by a downregulation of the neuronal alpha(3) subunit occurred in the hyperammonemic brain. Based on the effects of the inhibitors and literature data it is concluded that ammonia activates formation of an endogenous ouabain-like compound, which binds to the Na, K-ATPase, activating Src, which in turn stimulates the receptor-tyrosine kinase of the EGF receptor, leading to activation of the Ras, Raf, MEK pathway and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which eventually causes upregulation of alpha(2) gene expression.

This assumption has been validated in PET studies insofar as relating total flow to total CBV changes, but remains unconfirmed for venous CBV changes, which pertains to the primary vascular compartment modulating the BOLD signal In this study, we measured CBF and venous CBV changes in healthy subjects in response to graded hypercapnia and hypocapnia, induced using computerized end-tidal CO(2) targeting, with a Delta PETCO(2) range of between -6 and +9 mm Hg Hypercapnia was found to elicit robust increases in CBF and venous CBV, while hypocapnia produced decreases in both We used steady-state flow and volume changes to estimate the power-law relationship for cortical and subcortical brain regions, and did not observe significant difference between the two. The combined fit resulted in a power coefficient of 0 18 +/- 0 02. substantially lower than Grubb's coefficient of 0.38, but comparable to previous observations during neuronal activation. These results confirm that the BOLD-specific flow-volume relationship during CO(2) challenges is similar to that characterizing neuronal activation (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved	[Chen, J.

In the present fMRI study, we modulated the level of specificity of the semantic categorization task of famous face stimuli in order to map the brain regions involved in the specific semantic processing controlling for automatic name access. Specifically, participants (n = 12, mean age = 23 0 +/- 1.7 years, F/M = 8/4) were asked to determine whether the stimulus photograph matched with the label of the profession category Since the same set of stimuli was used for both specific and general conditions, contrasting these two conditions controlled for the activation due to the automatic access to the name of famous persons Results showed that 1) the right ATL was activated by a semantic categorization task of famous face stimuli at both general and specific level, 2) while controlling for the activation due to the automatic name retrieval, the left ATL showed increased activation during the specific categorization task, 3) the specificity of the semantic processing increased strength of connections towards the left ATL from the right lateral fusiform gyrus, devoted to the visual processing of faces, and from the right ATL These findings support the idea of a crucial role of the left anterior temporal lobe in the processing of person-specific semantic information.

Equivalent activation of the hippocampus by face-face and face-laugh paired associate learning and recognition	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Associative; Memory; Relational; Medial temporal; fMRI	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; MATERIAL-SPECIFIC LATERALIZATION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ITEM RECOGNITION; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; BRAIN-REGIONS; HEMISPHERIC-SPECIALIZATION; ANTERIOR HIPPOCAMPUS; RELATIONAL MEMORY; AMNESIC PATIENT	The human hippocampus is known to play an important role in relational memory. Both patient lesion studies and functional-imaging studies have shown that it is involved in the encoding and retrieval from memory of arbitrary associations. Two recent patient lesion studies, however, have found dissociations between spared and impaired memory within the domain of relational memory. Recognition of associations between information of the same kind (e.g., two faces) was spared, whereas recognition of associations between information of different kinds (e.g., face-name or face-voice associations) was impaired by hippocampal lesions. Thus, recognition of associations between information of the same kind may not be mediated by the hippocampus. Few imaging studies have directly compared activation at encoding and recognition of associations between same and different types of information. Those that have have shown mixed findings and been open to alternative interpretation. We used fMRI to compare hippocampal activation while participants studied and later recognized face-face and face-laugh paired associates. We found no differences in hippocampal activation between our two types of stimulus materials during either study or recognition. Study of both types of paired associate activated the hippocampus bilaterally, but the hippocampus was not activated by either condition during recognition. Our findings suggest that the human hippocampus is normally engaged to a similar extent by study and recognition of associations between information of the same kind and associations between information of different kinds.

The CUD relied on the difference between crossed and uncrossed responses whereas the asynchrony measure relied on the reaction time difference between the two responding hands. Manipulations of sensory and attentional factors were assessed for both measures. We found a normal CUD (3.8 ms) along with an exacerbated and more variable asynchrony for partial split-brain individuals (40.8 ms) compared to normal individuals (CUD: 0.4 ms, asynchrony: 13.8 ms). In turn, the CUD of total split-brain individuals (20.4 ms) was larger than that of partial split-brain and normal individuals. Also, the asynchrony of total split-brain individuals (57.6 ms) was larger and more variable than that of normal individuals, and more variable than that of partial split-brain individuals. We interpret these results as behavioural evidence of independent mechanisms underlying the CUD and bimanual synchronization, as well as evidence of the joint involvement of both the anterior and the posterior portions of the corpus callosum in bimanual coordination.

Methods: Twenty-seven MCI patients and 19 older controls were tested using a cued letter-digit classification switching task. Sixteen patients could perform the task (MCI-able), 6 could not (MCI-unable), and 5 were able only with cognitive support (MCI-cue). Demographic, neuropsychological, event-related potential (ERP). MRI, and genetic data were also collected. Results: The four groups did not differ on age, gender, and APO E4 frequency. Compared to the controls, the MCI-unable group had significantly poorer performance on the Trail Making task (eta(2) = .430), lower education (eta(2) = .234), and smaller cortical volume (eta(2) = .245). Most MCI patients exhibited task-switching deficits but to vastly different degrees and with varying outcomes. The combined pattern of neuropsychological and task switching performance indicates that the MCI-able patients displayed memory retrieval difficulties (F(2,39) = 3.6, p = .036, MSE = 1.44), generally preserved task switching abilities, and had a high probability of remaining dementia-free at follow-up. The MCI-cue patients had increased mixing costs, F(2,39), = 11.0, p < .001, MSE = .07; the MCI-unable patients showed episodic memory deficits, and both groups had a high probability of poor outcome (i.e., developing AD or dying within four years). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that variability in performance on measures of task-switching can highlight important heterogeneity in the MCI population.

This study examined symptoms of psychological distress, including suicidal ideation, among banana workers in Costa Rica previously exposed to a cholinesterase inhibiting pesticide. Methods 78 workers who had received medical attention 1-3 years previously for occupational pesticide poisoning were recruited: 54 had been exposed to organophosphate, 24 to carbamate, and 43 and 35, respectively, had single and multiple poisoning episodes with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Referents were 130 non-poisoned workers randomly selected from company payrolls. Psychological distress symptoms during the month prior to interview were obtained using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), which has a general severity index and nine subscale scores. Differences in abnormal BSI scores (T score >= 63) were assessed through multivariate logistic regression for all poisoned and for subcategories of poisoned as compared to non-poisoned workers. Results Organophosphate poisoned workers reported significantly more symptoms than non-poisoned on all but one symptom dimension. Significant trends of increasing symptoms with increasing number of previous poisonings were seen for somatisation, obsessive-compulsiveness, interpersonal sensitivity, depression and anxiety. Carbamate poisoned workers only had increased scores for somatisation. The ORs for suicidal thoughts were: all poisoned 3.58 (95% CI 1.45 to 8.84); organophosphate poisoned 3.72 (1.41 to 9.81); carbamate poisoned 2.57 (0.73 to 9.81); and 2.65 and 4.98, respectively for 1 and >= 2 poisonings (trend p=0.01). Conclusions This cross-sectional study showed a relationship between acute occupational poisoning with organophosphates and psychological distress including suicidal ideation. Stronger designs are needed to address causality.

The persistence of pain behaviors in patients with chronic back pain is independent of pain and psychological factors	PAIN			English	Article						Pain behavior; Chronic pain; Catastrophizing; Fear of movement; Disability	CATASTROPHIZING SCALE; ACTIVITY INTOLERANCE; SELF-REPORT; EXPRESSION; COMMUNICATION; DISABILITY; QUESTIONNAIRE; RELIABILITY; PERCEPTION; DEPRESSION	The primary purpose of the present study was to examine the temporal stability of communicative and protective pain behaviors in patients with chronic back pain. The study also examined whether the stability of pain behaviors could be accounted for by patients' levels of pain severity, catastrophizing, or fear of movement. Patients (n = 70) were filmed on two separate occasions (i.e., baseline, follow-up) while performing a standardized lifting task designed to elicit pain behaviors. Consistent with previous studies, the results provided evidence for the stability of pain behaviors in patients with chronic pain. The analyses indicated that communicative and protective pain behavior scores did not change significantly from baseline to follow-up. In addition, significant test-retest correlations were found between baseline and follow-up pain behavior scores. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses further showed that pain behaviors remained stable over time even when accounting for patients' levels of pain severity. Regression analyses also showed that pain behaviors remained stable when accounting for patients' levels of catastrophizing and fear of movement. Discussion addresses the potential contribution of central neural mechanisms and social environmental reinforcement contingencies to the stability of pain behaviors. The discussion also addresses how treatment interventions specifically aimed at targeting pain behaviors might help to augment the overall impact of pain and disability management programs.

A peripherally restricted cannabinoid receptor agonist produces robust anti-nociceptive effects in rodent models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain	PAIN			English	Article						Peripheral site of action; Cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 agonist; AZ11713908; Analgesia; Rat; Nociceptive flexor reflex	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RAT MODEL; ANTIHYPERALGESIC PROPERTIES; CUTANEOUS HYPERALGESIA; THERMAL NOCICEPTION; CB1; ANALGESIA; STRATEGIES; ALLODYNIA; EFFICACY	Cannabinoids are analgesic in man, but their use is limited by their psychoactive properties. One way to avoid cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 (CB1R)-mediated central side-effects is to develop CB1R agonists with limited CNS penetration. Activation of peripheral CB1Rs has been proposed to be analgesic, but the relative contribution of peripheral CB1Rs to the analgesic effects of systemic cannabinoids remains unclear. Here we addressed this by exploring the analgesic properties and site of action of AZ11713908, a peripherally restricted CB1R agonist, in rodent pain models. Systemic administration of AZ11713908 produced robust efficacy in rat pain models, comparable to that produced by WIN 55, 212-2, a CNS-penetrant, mixed CB1R and CB2R agonist, but AZ11713908 generated fewer CNS side-effects than WIN 55, 212-in a rat Irwin test. Since AZ11713908 is also a CB2R inverse agonist in rat and a partial CB2R agonist in mouse, we tested the specificity of the effects in CB1R and CB2R knock-out (KO) mice. Analgesic effects produced by AZ11713908 in wild-type mice with Freund's complete adjuvant-induced inflammation of the tail were completely absent in CB1R KO mice, but fully preserved in CB2R KO mice. An in vivo electrophysiological assay showed that the major site of action of AZ11713908 was peripheral. Similarly, intraplantar AZ11713908 was also sufficient to induce robust analgesia. These results demonstrate that systemic administration of AZ11713908, produced robust analgesia in rodent pain models via peripheral CB1R. Peripherally restricted CB1R agonists provide an interesting novel approach to analgesic therapy for chronic pain. (C) 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.

Although the majority of HTLV-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic carriers (AC) during their lifetime, 2-5% will develop either ATL or HAM/TSP, but never both. To better understand the gene expression changes in HTLV-1-associated diseases, we examined the mRNA profiles of CD4+ T cells isolated from 7 ATL, 12 HAM/TSP, 11 AC and 8 non-infected controls. Using genomic approaches followed by bioinformatic analysis, we identified gene expression pattern characteristic of HTLV-1 infected individuals and particular disease states. Of particular interest, the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1-SOCS1-was upregulated in HAM/TSP and AC patients but not in ATL. Moreover, SOCS1 was positively correlated with the expression of HTLV-1 mRNA in HAM/TSP patient samples. In primary PBMCs transfected with a HTLV-1 proviral clone and in HTLV-1-transformed MT-2 cells, HTLV-1 replication correlated with induction of SOCS1 and inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Targeting SOCS1 with siRNA restored type I IFN production and reduced HTLV-1 replication in MT-2 cells. Conversely, exogenous expression of SOCS1 resulted in enhanced HTLV-1 mRNA synthesis. In addition to inhibiting signaling downstream of the IFN receptor, SOCS1 inhibited IFN-beta production by targeting IRF3 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. These observations identify a novel SOCS1 driven mechanism of evasion of the type I IFN antiviral response against HTLV-1.

The utility of this approach has been significantly enhanced with the advent of mass spectrometry leading to the broad application of organelle proteomics. Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) form at the plasma membrane where they select protein and lipid cargo for endocytic entry into cells. CCVs also form at the trans-Golgi network, where they function in protein transport from the secretory pathway to the endosomal/lysosomal system. Herein we will describe how organelle proteomics of CCVs has greatly expanded our knowledge of the machineries, mechanisms and sites of clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking.

We chose a semantic categorization task previously used with patients. Schizotypal experiences were measured with the schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ). The effects of the other factors were controlled for when assessing the correlations between each SPQ factor and N400s. These correlations were assessed at each electrode site to see whether their distribution on the scalp follows that of the N400 effect. Disorganization and interpersonal scores were found to correlate with ERPs in the N400 time window, as previously reported for the comparable symptoms of patients. However, the scalp distribution of these correlations differed from that of the N400 effect.	[Debruille, J.

Frequency and cause of disagreements in imaging diagnosis in children with ventriculomegaly diagnosed prenatally	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						fetal MRI; imaging consensus; ventriculomegaly	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; LATERAL VENTRICLES; PRETERM INFANTS; NEONATAL OUTCOMES; CLINICAL COURSE; FETAL; ULTRASOUND; ABNORMALITIES; SIZE; HORN	Objectives To assess the frequency and cause of variability in diagnosis on cranial sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children referred following prenatal diagnosis of ventriculomegaly. Methods Between 19 September 2003 and 16 March 2007, 119 infants with ultrasound and/or MRI studies performed within 13 months (median, 6 days) after birth, following prenatal referral for ventriculomegaly, were studied prospectively. There were 97 infants with ultrasound results and 53 with MRI, including 31 with both. Three sonologists and three pediatric neuroradiologists interpreted the postnatal ultrasound and MRI findings, blinded to prenatal diagnosis, and a final consensus diagnosis or group of diagnoses was obtained. Ventricular sizes as well as types of and reasons for any disagreement in diagnosis were recorded. Disagreements on a per patient basis were categorized as being major when they crossed diagnostic categories and had the potential to change patient counseling. Postnatal and prenatal diagnoses were compared. Results There was prospective agreement on 42/97 (43%) ultrasound and on 9/53 (17%) MRI readings. Prospective consensus was more likely when the number of central nervous system (CNS) anomalies was lower (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002 for ultrasound and MRI, respectively). In 24/55 (44%) ultrasound and 11/44 (25%) MRI examinations with disagreement in diagnosis, there was disagreement concerning the presence of ventriculomegaly. In 22/97 (23%) ultrasound studies and 22/53 (42%) MRI studies the disagreements were potentially important. Reasons for discrepancies in the reporting of major findings included errors of observation as well as modality differences in depiction of abnormalities. In comparing prenatal with postnatal diagnoses, there were 11/97 (11%) ultrasound and 27/53 (51%) MRI examinations with newly detected major findings, the most common being migrational abnormalities, callosal dysgenesis/destruction and interval development of hemorrhage. Conclusion Variability in postnatal CNS diagnosis is common after a prenatal diagnosis of ventriculomegaly. This is due in part to a lack of standardization in the definition of postnatal ventriculomegaly. Copyright (C) 2010 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Levine, D.; Mehta, T. S.; Werdich, X.

Cardiac Autonomic Dysfunction in Idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						REM sleep behavior disorder; Parkinson's disease; Lewy body dementia; autonomic	POWER SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; PATHOLOGY; DEMENTIA; MARKER; RISK	More than 50% of persons with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) will develop Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia. Symptom screens and metaiodo-benzylguanine (MIBG)-scintigraphy suggest autonomic abnormalities in idiopathic RBD, but it is unclear whether autonomic abnormalities can predict neurodegenerative disease. From a cohort of 99 patients with idiopathic RBD, we selected those who developed parkinsonism or dementia. These were matched by age, sex, and follow-up duration to patients with RBD who remained disease free and to matched controls. From the polysomnographic trace performed at baseline evaluation, measures of beat-to-beat RR variability including time domains (mean RR-interval and RR-standard deviation) and frequency domains (low and high frequency components) were retrospectively assessed. Twenty-one patients with idiopathic RBD who developed neurodegenerative disease were included (Parkinson's disease-11, multiple system atrophy-1, and dementia-9). Age at PSG was 66 years, and 86% were male. PSG was performed on average 6.7 years before defined neurodegenerative disease. Comparing all patients with idiopathic RBD to controls, there were significant reductions in RR-standard deviation (24.6 +/- 2.2 ms vs. 35.2 +/- 3.5 ms, P = 0.006), very low frequency components (238.6 +/- 99.6 ms(2) vs. 840.1 +/- 188.3 ms(2), P < 0.001), and low frequency components (127.8 +/- 26.3 ms(2) vs. 288.7 +/- 66.2 ms(2), P = 0.032). However, despite clear differences between patients with idiopathic RBD and controls, there were no differences in any measure between those who did or did not develop disease. RR-variability analysis demonstrates substantial autonomic dysfunction in idiopathic RBD. However, this dysfunction is identical in patients who will or will not develop defined neurodegenerative disease. This suggests that autonomic dysfunction is linked with RBD independent of associated Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia.

To better understand this issue, we measured sleep characteristics between 1999 and 2003 in 150 outpatients diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 80 healthy controls using a sleep habits questionnaire. Comparisons between both groups were performed and multiple comparisons were Bonferroni corrected. Compared to healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia reported significantly increased sleep latency, time in bed, total sleep time and frequency of naps during weekdays and weekends along with normal sleep efficiency, sleep satisfaction, and feeling of restfulness in the morning. In conclusion, sleep-onset insomnia is a major, enduring disorder in middle-aged, non-hospitalized patients with schizophrenia that are otherwise clinically stable under antipsychotic and adjuvant medications. Noteworthy, these patients do not complain of sleep-maintenance insomnia but report increased sleep propensity and normal sleep satisfaction. These results may reflect circadian disturbances in schizophrenia, but objective laboratory investigations are needed to confirm subjective sleep reports. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We tested the hypothesis that the strength of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling contributed to memory CD8(+) T cell generation. Methodology/Principal Findings: We manipulated the density of antigenic epitope presented by dendritic cells to mouse naive CD8(+) T cells, without varying TCR affinity. Our results show that a two-fold decrease in antigen dose selectively affects memory CD8(+) T cell generation without influencing T cell expansion and acquisition of effector functions. Moreover, we show that low antigen dose alters the duration of the interaction between T cells and dendritic cells and finely tunes the expression level of the transcription factors Eomes and Bcl6. Furthermore, we demonstrate that priming with higher epitope density results in a 2-fold decrease in the expression of Neuron-derived orphan nuclear receptor 1 (Nor-1) and this correlates with a lower level of conversion of Bcl-2 into a pro-apoptotic molecule and an increased number of memory T cells. Conclusions: Our results show that the amount of antigen encountered by naive CD8(+) T cells following immunization with dendritic cells does not influence the generation of functional effector CD8(+) T cells but rather the number of CD8(+) memory T cells that persist in the host. Our data support a model where antigenic epitope density sensed by CD8(+) T cells at priming influences memory generation by modulating Bcl6, Eomes and Nor-1 expression.

Functional diversity in the color vision of cichlid fishes	BMC BIOLOGY			English	Article							TUNING SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY; VERTEBRATE VISUAL PIGMENTS; TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; OPSIN GENE-EXPRESSION; LAKE MALAWI CICHLIDS; PREY-SEARCH BEHAVIOR; POLARIZATION SENSITIVITY; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; ECOLOGICAL CAUSES	Background: Color vision plays a critical role in visual behavior. An animal's capacity for color vision rests on the presence of differentially sensitive cone photoreceptors. Spectral sensitivity is a measure of the visual responsiveness of these cones at different light wavelengths. Four classes of cone pigments have been identified in vertebrates, but in teleost fishes, opsin genes have undergone gene duplication events and thus can produce a larger number of spectrally distinct cone pigments. In this study, we examine the question of large-scale variation in color vision with respect to individual, sex and species that may result from differential expression of cone pigments. Cichlid fishes are an excellent model system for examining variation in spectral sensitivity because they have seven distinct cone opsin genes that are differentially expressed. Results: To examine the variation in the number of cones that participate in cichlid spectral sensitivity, we used whole organism electrophysiology, opsin gene expression and empirical modeling. Examination of over 100 spectral sensitivity curves from 34 individuals of three species revealed that (1) spectral sensitivity of individual cichlids was based on different subsets of four or five cone pigments, (2) spectral sensitivity was shaped by multiple cone interactions and (3) spectral sensitivity differed between species and correlated with foraging mode and the spectral reflectance of conspecifics. Our data also suggest that there may be significant differences in opsin gene expression between the sexes. Conclusions: Our study describes complex opponent and nonopponent cone interactions that represent the requisite neural processing for color vision. We present the first comprehensive evidence for pentachromatic color vision in vertebrates, which offers the potential for extraordinary spectral discrimination capabilities. We show that opsin gene expression in cichlids, and possibly also spectral sensitivity, may be sex-dependent. We argue that females and males sample their visual environment differently, providing a neural basis for sexually dimorphic visual behaviour. The diversification of spectral sensitivity likely contributes to sensory adaptations that enhance the contrast of transparent prey and the detection of optical signals from conspecifics, suggesting a role for both natural and sexual selection in tuning color vision.

Drosophila Glial Glutamate Transporter Eaat1 Is Regulated by Fringe-Mediated Notch Signaling and Is Essential for Larval Locomotion	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTERS; HIGH-AFFINITY TRANSPORT; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; LONGITUDINAL GLIA; GENE-EXPRESSION; GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE FRINGE; SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION; RECEPTOR SUBUNIT; EPISODIC ATAXIA	In the mammalian CNS, glial cells expressing excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) tightly regulate extracellular glutamate levels to control neurotransmission and protect neurons from excitotoxic damage. Dysregulated EAAT expression is associated with several CNS pathologies in humans, yet mechanisms of EAAT regulation and the importance of glutamate transport for CNS development and function in vivo remain incompletely understood. Drosophila is an advanced genetic model with only a single high-affinity glutamate transporter termed Eaat1. We found that Eaat1 expression in CNS glia is regulated by the glycosyltransferase Fringe, which promotes neuron-to-glia signaling through the Delta-Notch ligand receptor pair during embryogenesis. We made Eaat1 loss-of-function mutations and found that homozygous larvae could not perform the rhythmic peristaltic contractions required for crawling. We found no evidence for excitotoxic cell death or overt defects in the development of neurons and glia, and the crawling defect could be induced by postembryonic inactivation of Eaat1. Eaat1 fully rescued locomotor activity when expressed in only a limited subpopulation of glial cells situated near potential glutamatergic synapses within the CNS neuropil. Eaat1 mutants had deficits in the frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of synaptic currents in motor neurons whose rhythmic patterns of activity may be regulated by glutamatergic neurotransmission among premotor interneurons; similar results were seen with pharmacological manipulations of glutamate transport. Our findings indicate that Eaat1 expression is promoted by Fringe-mediated neuron glial communication during development and suggest that Eaat1 plays an essential role in regulating CNS neural circuits that control locomotion in Drosophila.

Mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause ALS through a gain of toxic function. Calpain activity is increased in mutant SOD1 (SOD1(G93A)) transgenic mice and in models of ischemia because of increased cytosolic calcium, which has been documented in motor neurons in rodent models of familial ALS and in sporadic ALS patients. We report that inhibition of calpain activity using calpastatin prevented the toxicity of SOD1(G93A) in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord cultures, prolonging viability of and reducing the proportion containing SOD1(G93A) inclusions. The data support the central role of calcium dysregulation in ALS and identify a potential therapeutic pathway.

It is believed that the blind's superior performance is because of their efficient use of proprioceptive signals and environmental cues such as temperature and echolocation. We hypothesize that by limiting these cues, blind individuals will lose their advantage compared with controls in spatial navigation tasks. We therefore evaluated the performance of blind and sighted individuals in small-scale, tactile multiple T mazes. Our results show that blindfolded sighted controls outperformed blind participants in the route-learning tasks. This suggests that, contrary to indoor large-scale spaces, navigational skills inside small-scale spaces benefit from visual experience.

Statin use and risk of epilepsy A nested case-control study	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL CELL-DEATH; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; INFLAMMATION; ACCURACY; SEIZURES; THERAPY	Objective: To examine the potential efficacy of hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in the prevention of epilepsy. Methods: This study was a population-based, nested case-control study among older adults in the province of Quebec, Canada. The primary cohort consisted of cardiovascular patients who had received a revascularization procedure. Within the cohort, those with the primary hospital diagnosis of epilepsy were identified (cases). Each case was matched to 10 controls by age and cohort entry time. Potential confounders were adjusted using a conditional logistic regression model. A sensitivity analysis was performed using propensity score matching. Results: The initial cohort consisted of 150,555 subjects. Within the cohort, 217 hospital-diagnosed cases of epilepsy and 2,170 corresponding controls were identified. The adjusted rate ratio (ARR) for epilepsy among current statin users was 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.92). The ARR for past users of statins was 0.72 (95% CI 0.39-1.30). No benefit was found for the control drug groups, including nonstatin cholesterol-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (1.00 [95% CI 0.45-2.20], 1.04 [95% CI 0.74-1.47], and 0.94 [95% CI 0.66-1.33]). Conclusions: These results suggest that statin use decreases the risk of hospitalization for epilepsy. Because of its observational nature, this study requires future research to confirm these intriguing findings.

In neonates, it is commonly admitted that the retrotrapezoid/parafacial respiratory group of neurons of the ventral medulla plays the primary role in the respiratory response to acidosis, although the serotonergic system may also contribute to this response. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using en bloc medullary preparations from neonatal mice, we have shown for the first time that the respiratory response to acidosis is abolished after pre-treatment with the serotonin-transporter blocker fluoxetine (25-50 mu M, 20 min), a commonly used antidepressant. Using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistology, we have also shown the expression of the serotonin transporter mRNA and serotonin-containing neurons in the vicinity of the RTN/pFRG of neonatal mice. Conclusions: These results reveal that the serotonergic system plays a pivotal role in pH homeostasis. Although obtained in vitro in neonatal mice, they suggest that drugs targeting the serotonergic system should be used with caution in infants, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers.

Filamin A regulates focal adhesion disassembly and suppresses breast cancer cell migration and invasion	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							CALCIUM-SENSING RECEPTOR; CALPAIN-MEDIATED PROTEOLYSIS; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; ACTIN STRESS FIBERS; C-TERMINAL REGION; MELANOMA-CELLS; PERIVENTRICULAR HETEROTOPIA; NEURONAL MIGRATION; PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS; RHO-GTPASES	The actin cross-linking protein filamin A (FLNa) functions as a scaffolding protein and couples cell cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix and integrin receptor signaling. In this study, we report that FLNa suppresses invasion of breast cancer cells and regulates focal adhesion (FA) turnover. Two large progression tissue microarrays from breast cancer patients revealed a significant decrease of FLNa levels in tissues from invasive breast cancer compared with benign disease and in lymph node-positive compared with lymph node-negative breast cancer. In breast cancer cells and orthotopic mouse breast cancer models, down-regulation of FLNa stimulated cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis formation. Time-lapse microscopy and biochemical assays after FLNa silencing and rescue with wild-type or mutant protein resistant to calpain cleavage revealed that FLNa regulates FA disassembly at the leading edge of motile cells. Moreover, FLNa down-regulation enhanced calpain activity through the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade and stimulated the cleavage of FA proteins. These results document a regulation of FA dynamics by FLNa in breast cancer cells.

The role of endogenous DA in the regulation of clock gene expression is unknown. Here, we demonstrate a direct relationship between extracellular DA levels and the rhythm of expression of the clock protein PERIOD2 (PER2) in the dorsal striatum of the male Wistar rat. Specifically, we show that the peak of the daily rhythm of extracellular DA in the dorsal striatum precedes the peak of PER2 by similar to 6 h and that depletion of striatal DA by 6-hydroxydopamine or alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine or blockade of D-2 DA receptors by raclopride blunts the rhythm of striatal PER2. Furthermore, timed daily activation of D-2 DA receptors, but not D-1 DA receptors, restores and entrains the PER2 rhythm in the DA-depleted striatum. None of these manipulations had any effect on the PER2 rhythm in the SCN. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the rhythm of expression of PER2 in the dorsal striatum depends on daily dopaminergic activation of D-2 DA receptors. These observations may have implications for circadian abnormalities seen in Parkinson's disease.

How the growth cone spatially and temporally regulates signals from guidance cues is poorly understood. Through a proteomic analysis of purified growth cones we identified isoforms of the 14-3-3 family of adaptor proteins as major constituents of the growth cone. Disruption of 14-3-3 via the R18 antagonist or knockdown of individual 14-3-3 isoforms switches nerve growth factor- and myelin-associated glycoprotein-dependent repulsion to attraction in embryonic day 13 chick and postnatal day 5 rat DRG neurons. These effects are reminiscent of switching responses observed in response to elevated cAMP. Intriguingly, R18-dependent switching is blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA), suggesting that 14-3-3 proteins regulate PKA. Consistently, 14-3-3 proteins interact with PKA and R18 activates PKA by dissociating its regulatory and catalytic subunits. Thus, 14-3-3 heterodimers regulate the PKA holoenzyme and this activity plays a critical role in modulating neuronal responses to repellent cues.

SPECTRUM DISORDERS; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS; GENETIC ARCHITECTURE; PTEN MUTATIONS; ASSOCIATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INDIVIDUALS; POPULATION	Although autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a substantial genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare variants, principally copy number variants (CNVs). To identify common risk variation, the Autism Genome Project (AGP) Consortium genotyped 1558 rigorously defined ASD families for 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and analyzed these SNP genotypes for association with ASD. In one of four primary association analyses, the association signal for marker rs4141463, located within MACROD2, crossed the genome-wide association significance threshold of P < 5 x 10(-8). When a smaller replication sample was analyzed, the risk allele at rs4141463 was again over-transmitted; yet, consistent with the winner's curse, its effect size in the replication sample was much smaller; and, for the combined samples, the association signal barely fell below the P < 5 x 10(-8) threshold. Exploratory analyses of phenotypic subtypes yielded no significant associations after correction for multiple testing. They did, however, yield strong signals within several genes, KIAA0564, PLD5, POU6F2, ST8SIA2 and TAF1C.

Alternatively Spliced Caspase-6B Isoform Inhibits the Activation of Caspase-6A	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROGRAMMED CELL-DEATH; HUMAN NEURONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LENS DEVELOPMENT; APOPTOSIS; PROTEIN; DEGRADATION; EXPRESSION; CLEAVAGE; CLONING	Caspase-6 (Casp6) is activated early in Alzheimer disease and involved in axonal degeneration, but the regulation of Casp6 activity has not been explored. Several alternatively spliced forms of caspases act as inhibitors of caspase activation. The CASP6 gene generates an alternatively spliced transcript known as CASP6 beta in addition to the CASP6 alpha that encodes pro-Casp6a. Here, we show that the CASP6 beta transcript and the pro-Casp6b protein are present in many cell lines, in primary human neurons, and in human brains. Unlike most other alternatively spliced caspase transcripts, pro-Casp6b contains a catalytic site. However, purified pro-Casp6b did not have caspase activity, nor did it inhibit already activated Casp6a. Pro-Casp6b prevented the proteolytic activation of pro-Casp6a in vitro and in cells. Pro-Casp6b interacts directly with pro-Casp6a. This work shows that pro-Casp6b is an inhibitor of pro-Casp6a activation. These results imply that pro-Casp6b could negatively regulate pro-Casp6a activation in neurons and prevent Casp6a-mediated axonal degeneration.

Cortical structure predicts success in performing musical transformation judgments	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; LATERAL HESCHLS GYRUS; INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS; GRAY-MATTER; MRI DATA; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; NEURAL SUBSTRATE; MENTAL ROTATION	Recognizing melodies by their interval structure, or "relative pitch," is a fundamental aspect of musical perception. By using relative pitch, we are able to recognize tunes regardless of the key in which they are played. We sought to determine the cortical areas important for relative pitch processing using two morphometric techniques. Cortical differences have been reported in musicians within right auditory cortex (AC), a region considered important for pitch-based processing, and we have previously reported a functional correlation between relative pitch processing in the anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS). We addressed the hypothesis that regional variation of cortical structure within AC and IPS is related to relative pitch ability using two anatomical techniques, cortical thickness (CT) analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of magnetic resonance imaging data. Persons with variable amounts of formal musical training were tested on a melody transposition task, as well as two musical control tasks and a speech control task. We found that gray matter concentration and cortical thickness in right Heschl's sulcus and bilateral IPS both predicted relative pitch task performance and correlated to a lesser extent with performance on the two musical control tasks. After factoring out variance explained by musical training, only relative pitch performance was predicted by cortical structure in these regions. These results directly demonstrate the functional relevance of previously reported anatomical differences in the auditory cortex of musicians. The findings in the IPS provide further support for the existence of a multimodal network for systematic transformation of stimulus information in this region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Anterior cingulate cortex; Anterior insula; Human mirror neuron system; Empathy	COMMON NEURAL BASIS; GRASP REPRESENTATIONS; CINGULATE CORTEX; EMPATHY; MECHANISMS; IMITATION; PERCEPTION; EXPERIENCE; HUMANS; OTHERS	The communication of pain requires the perception of pain-related signals and the extraction of their meaning and magnitude to infer the state of the expresser. Here, BOLD responses were measured in healthy volunteers while they evaluated the amount of pain expressed (pain task) or discriminated movements (movement task) in one-second video clips displaying facial expressions of various levels of pain. Regression analysis using subjects' ratings of pain confirmed the parametric response of several regions previously involved in the coding of self-pain, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (aINS), as well as areas implicated in action observation, and motor mirroring, such as the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Furthermore, the pain task produced stronger activation in the ventral IFG, as well as in areas of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) associated with social cognition and emotional mirroring, whereas stronger activation during the movement task predominated in the IPL These results suggest that perception of the pain of another via facial expression recruits limbic regions involved in the coding of self-pain, prefrontal areas underlying social and emotional cognition (i.e. 'mentalizing.), and premotor and parietal areas involved in motor mirroring.

The objectives here are to: 1) provide data on changes in human contaminant concentrations and exposure among Canadian Arctic peoples; 2) identify new contaminants of concern; 3) discuss possible health effects: 4) outline risk communication about contaminants in country food; and 5) identify knowledge gaps for future contaminant research and monitoring. The nutritional and cultural benefits of country foods are substantial; however, some dietary studies suggest declines in the amount of country foods being consumed. Significant declines were found for most contaminants in maternal blood over the last 10 years within all three Arctic regions studied. Inuit continue to have the highest levels of almost all persistent organic pollutants (POPS) and metals among the ethnic groups studied. A greater proportion of people in the East exceed Health Canada's guidelines for PCBs and mercury, although the proportion of mothers exceeding these guidelines has decreased since the previous assessment. Further monitoring and research are required to assess trends and health effects of emerging contaminants. Infant development studies have shown possible subtle effects of prenatal exposure to heavy metals and some POPs on immune system function and neurodevelopment. New data suggest important beneficial effects on brain development for Inuit infants from some country food nutrients. The most successful risk communication processes balance the risks and benefits of a diet of country food through input from a variety of regional experts and the community, to incorporate the many socio-cultural and economic factors to arrive at a risk management decision that will be the most beneficial in Arctic communities.

J	Rashid, MH; Lopez-Garcia, JA; Cervero, F				Rashid, Md Harunor; Lopez-Garcia, Jose A.; Cervero, Fernando			Stimulation of dorsal root afferents increases the excitability of ascending sensory axons in the isolated spinal cord of mature mice	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Spinal cord; Ascending pathways; Windup; Electrophysiology; Nociception	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; IN-VITRO; HORN NEURONS; WIND-UP; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; FLEXION REFLEX; RAT; PAIN	The phenomenon of windup has often been used to assess excitability increases of spinal neurons induced by repetitive stimulation of nociceptive afferents. Windup has been studied in individual spinal cord neurons and in spinal motor reflexes neither of which accurately reflect the forward transmission of nociceptive signals to the brain. In addition, most in vitro studies of spinal windup have been conducted on immature or juvenile animals and it is challenging to extrapolate these results to the adult spinal cord. In the present study, we have used an in vitro whole spinal cord preparation from functionally mature mice (up to 8 weeks old) to record windup activity in ascending axons in the mid-thoracic region evoked by electrical stimulation of a lumbar or sacral dorsal root. Windup responses were observed in axons in the ipsi- and contralateral dorsolateral funiculus (iDLF and cDLF) and in the contralateral ventrolateral funiculus (cVLF). No windup responses were evoked in postsynaptic axons of the ipsilateral dorsal columns (iDC) and no postsynaptic responses were elicited in the ipsilateral ventrolateral funiculus (iVLF) or contralateral dorsal columns (cDC). Between 40% and 45% of all axons in the DLF and cVLF that responded to a single dorsal root stimulus also showed windup. The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 reversibly blocked such windup responses. These results illustrate that windup can be consistently recorded from ascending pathways in the mature spinal cord in vitro but also show that windup can only be elicited in a proportion of sensory axons projecting through some, but not all, ascending spinal cord pathways.

Progranulin modulates zebrafish motoneuron development in vivo and rescues truncation defects associated with knockdown of Survival motor neuron 1	MOLECULAR NEURODEGENERATION			English	Article							FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; AXON OUTGROWTH; EMBRYONIC ZEBRAFISH; GENE FAMILY; MUTATIONS; DEMENTIA; GROWTH; INCLUSIONS; EXPRESSION	Background: Progranulin (PGRN) encoded by the GRN gene, is a secreted glycoprotein growth factor that has been implicated in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. PGRN haploinsufficiency caused by autosomal dominant mutations within the GRN gene leads to progressive neuronal atrophy in the form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). This form of the disease is associated with neuronal inclusions that bear the ubiquitinated TAR DNA Binding Protein-43 (TDP-43) molecular signature (FTLD-U). The neurotrophic properties of PGRN in vitro have recently been reported but the role of PGRN in neurons is not well understood. Here we document the neuronal expression and functions of PGRN in spinal cord motoneuron (MN) maturation and branching in vivo using zebrafish, a well established model of vertebrate embryonic development. Results: Whole-mount in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses of zebrafish embryos revealed that zfPGRN-A is expressed within the peripheral and central nervous systems including the caudal primary (CaP) MNs within the spinal cord. Knockdown of zfPGRN-A mRNA translation mediated by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides disrupted normal CaP MN development resulting in both truncated MNs and inappropriate early branching. Ectopic over-expression of zfPGRN-A mRNA resulted in increased MN branching and rescued the truncation defects brought about by knockdown of zfPGRN-A expression. The ability of PGRN to interact with established MN developmental pathways was tested. PGRN over-expression was found to reverse the truncation defect resulting from knockdown of Survival of motor neuron 1 (smn1). This is involved in small ribonucleoprotein biogenesis RNA processing, mutations of which cause Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in humans. It did not reverse the MN defects caused by interfering with the neuronal guidance pathway by knockdown of expression of NRP-1, a semaphorin co-receptor. Conclusions: Expression of PGRN within MNs and the observed phenotypes resulting from mRNA knockdown and over-expression are consistent with a role in the regulation of spinal cord MN development and branching. This study presents the first in vivo demonstration of the neurotrophic properties of PGRN and suggests possible future therapeutic applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

In this work, we identified mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2 or MK2), a downstream substrate of p38 MAPK, as a potential target using microarray analysis of contused spinal cord tissue taken at the peak of the inflammatory response. There was increased expression and phosphorylation of MK2 after SCI, with phospho-MK2 expressed in microglia/macrophages, neurons and astrocytes. We examined the role of MK2 in spinal cord contusion injury using MK2(-/-) mice. These results show that locomotor recovery was significantly improved in MK2(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type controls. MK2(-/-) mice showed reduced neuron and myelin loss, and increased sparing of serotonergic fibers in the ventral horn caudal to the injury site. We also found differential expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 in MK2(-/-) and wild-type mice after SCI. Significant reduction was also seen in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and protein nitrosylation in the injured spinal cord of MK2(-/-) mice. Our previous work has shown that macrophages lacking MK2 have an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We now show that there is no difference in the number of macrophages in the injured spinal cord between the two mouse strains and little if any difference in their phagocytic capacity, suggesting that macrophages lacking MK2 have a beneficial phenotype. These findings suggest that a lack of MK2 can reduce tissue damage after SCI and improve locomotor recovery. MK2 may therefore be a useful target to treat acute SCI.

Four groups of young healthy individuals were assigned to either (i) a night/sleep condition, in which they were scanned while practicing a finger sequence learning task or an eight-target adaptation pointing task in the evening (test) and were scanned again 12 h later in the morning (retest) or (ii) a day/awake condition, in which they were scanned on the MSL or the MA tasks in the morning and were rescanned 12 h later in the evening. As expected and consistent with the behavioral results, the functional data revealed increased test-retest changes of activity in the striatum for the night/sleep group compared with the day/awake group in the MSL task. By contrast, the results of the MA task did not show any difference in test-retest activity between the night/sleep and day/awake groups. When the two MA task groups were combined, however, increased test-retest activity was found in lobule VI of the cerebellar cortex. Together, these findings highlight the presence of both functional and structural dissociations reflecting the off-line consolidation processes of MSL and MA. They suggest that MSL consolidation is sleep dependent and reflected by a differential increase of neural activity within the corticostriatal system, whereas MA consolidation necessitates either a period of daytime or sleep and is associated with increased neuronal activity within the corticocerebellar system.

VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Contour; Curvature; Size; Adaptation; Shape; After-effect	SPATIAL-FREQUENCY SHIFT; INTER-OCULAR TRANSFER; HUMAN VISION; ADAPTATION; ORIENTATION; CONTRAST; DIRECTION; NEURONES; PATTERNS; STIMULI	The shape-frequency and shape-amplitude after-effects, or SFAE and SAAE, are shifts in the perceived shape-frequency and perceived shape-amplitude of a sinusoidal test contour following adaptation to a similar-shaped contour. These shape-effects are the shape analogs of the well-known size after-effect discovered by Blakemore and Sutton (1969), so it is possible that they are mediated by a size-sensitive mechanism. We tested this possibility by comparing the magnitudes of SFAEs/SAAEs elicited by contour/edge adaptors with those from luminance grating and line-grating adaptors. The rationale was that if the shape after-effects using the two classes of adaptors were similar, then they would likely be mediated by the same mechanism. We found that the SFAE and SAAE were greatly reduced when using luminance and line grating adaptors, suggesting that the SFAE and SAAE are not mediated primarily by either first- or second-order size-sensitive mechanisms. Based on previous studies we conclude that SFAEs/SAAEs are mediated by mechanisms primarily sensitive to curvature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analysis of the Biogenesis of Heparan Sulfate Acetyl-CoA:alpha-Glucosaminide N-Acetyltransferase Provides Insights into the Mechanism Underlying Its Complete Deficiency in Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DISEASE TYPE-C; MEMBRANE-PROTEINS; COENZYME-A; TRANSMEMBRANE ACETYLATION; HGSNAT GENE; LYSOSOMES; MUTATIONS; SPECTRUM; CHANNEL; BINDING	Heparan sulfate acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT) catalyzes the transmembrane acetylation of heparan sulfate in lysosomes required for its further catabolism. Inherited deficiency of HGSNAT in humans results in lysosomal storage of heparan sulfate and causes the severe neurodegenerative disease, mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC). Previously we have cloned the HGSNAT gene, identified molecular defects in MPS IIIC patients, and found that all missense mutations prevented normal folding and trafficking of the enzyme. Therefore characterization of HGSNAT biogenesis and intracellular trafficking became of central importance for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the disease and developing future therapies. In the current study we show that HGSNAT is synthesized as a catalytically inactive 77-kDa precursor that is transported to the lysosomes via an adaptor protein-mediated pathway that involves conserved tyrosine-and dileucine-based lysosomal targeting signals in its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain with a contribution from a dileucine-based signal in the N-terminal cytoplasmic loop. In the lysosome, the precursor is cleaved into a 29-kDa N-terminal alpha-chain and a 48-kDa C-terminal beta-chain, and assembled into active similar to 440-kDa oligomers. The subunits are held together by disulfide bonds between at least two cysteine residues (Cys(123) and Cys(434)) in the lysosomal luminal loops of the enzyme. We speculate that proteolytic cleavage allows the nucleophile residue, His(269), in the active site to access the substrate acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm, for further transfer of the acetyl group to the terminal glucosamine on heparan sulfate. Altogether our results identify intralysosomal oligomerization and proteolytic cleavage as two steps crucial for functional activation of HGSNAT.

Here, we found that supernatants from human GA-reactive T lymphocytes potentiated oligodendrocyte numbers in rodent and human oligodendrocyte progenitor (OPC) cultures. Effects of Th2-polarized lines were stronger than Th1-polarized cells. Microarray and ELISA analyses revealed that neurotrophic factors induced in Th2-and Th1-polarized GA-reactive lines included IGF-2 and BMP-7 respectively, and functional studies confirmed IGF-2 as trophic for OPCs.

Aberrant expression of TSPO has been linked to multiple diseases, including cancer, brain injury, neurodegeneration, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. There has been an effort during the last decade to understand the mechanisms regulating tissue- and disease-specific TSPO expression and to identify pharmacological means to control its expression This review focuses on the current knowledge regarding the chemicals, hormones, and molecular mechanisms regulating Tspo gene expression under physiological conditions in a tissue- and disease-specific manner. The results described here provide evidence that the PKC epsilon-ERK1/2-AP-1/STAT3 signal transduction pathway is the primary regulator of Tspo gene expression in normal and pathological tissues expressing high levels of TSPO (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved	[Batarseh, Amani; Papadopoulos, Vassilios] McGill Univ, Montreal Gen Hosp, Res Inst, Ctr Hlth, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada; [Batarseh, Amani; Papadopoulos, Vassilios] McGill Univ, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada; [Papadopoulos, Vassilios] McGill Univ, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada; [Papadopoulos, Vassilios] McGill Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Therapeut, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada; [Batarseh, Amani; Papadopoulos, Vassilios] Georgetown Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol & Cell Biol, Med Ctr, Washington, DC 20057 USA	Papadopoulos, V (reprint author), McGill Univ, Montreal Gen Hosp, Res Inst, Ctr Hlth, 1650 Cedar Ave,C10-148, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada.

TAC4 and hHK-1 expression as well as effects of hHK-1 in the lung and airways remain however unknown and were explored in this study. Methods: RT-PCR analysis was performed on human bronchi to assess expression of tachykinin and tachykinin receptors genes. Enzyme immunoassay was used to quantify hHK-1, and effects of hHK-1 and endokinins on contraction of human and guinea pig airways were then evaluated, as well as the role of hHK-1 on cytokines production by human lung parenchyma or bronchi explants and by lung macrophages. Results: In human bronchi, expression of the genes that encode for hHK-1, tachykinin NK(1)-and NK(2)-receptors was demonstrated. hHK-1 protein was found in supernatants from explants of human bronchi, lung parenchyma and lung macrophages. Exogenous hHK-1 caused a contractile response in human bronchi mainly through the activation of NK(2)-receptors, which blockade unmasked a NK(1)-receptor involvement, subject to a rapid desensitization. In the guinea pig trachea, hHK-1 caused a concentration-dependant contraction mainly mediated through the activation of NK(1)-receptors. Endokinin A/B exerted similar effects to hHK-1 on both human bronchi and guinea pig trachea, whereas endokinins C and D were inactive. hHK-1 had no impact on the production of cytokines by explants of human bronchi or lung parenchyma, or by human lung macrophages. Conclusions: We demonstrate endogenous expression of TAC4 in human bronchi, the encoded peptide hHK-1 being expressed and involved in contraction of human and guinea pig airways.

Animal studies have clearly demonstrated PS effects on the offspring's brain, however, while it has been speculated that PS most likely affects the brains of exposed human fetuses as well, no study has to date examined this possibility prospectively using an independent stressor (i.e., a stressful event that the pregnant woman has no control over, such as a natural disaster). The aim of this review is to summarize the existing animal literature by focusing on specific brain regions that have been shown to be affected by PS both macroscopically and microscopically. These regions include the hippocampus, amygdala, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hypothalamus. We first discuss the mechanisms by which the effects of PS might occur. In particular, we show that maternal and fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes, and the placenta, are the most likely candidates for these mechanisms. We see that, although animal studies have obvious advantages over human studies, the integration of findings in animals and the transfer of these findings to human populations remains a complex issue. Finally, we show how it is possible to circumvent these challenges by studying the effects of PS on brain development directly in humans, by taking advantage of natural or man-made disasters and assessing the impact and consequences of such stressful events on pregnant women and their offspring prospectively.

Patients with chronic pain have reported using smoked cannabis to relieve pain, improve sleep and improve mood. Methods: Adults with post-traumatic or postsurgical neuropathic pain were randomly assigned to receive cannabis at four potencies (0%, 2.5%, 6% and 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol) over four 14-day periods in a crossover trial. Participants inhaled a single 25-mg dose through a pipe three times daily for the first five days in each cycle, followed by a nine-day washout period. Daily average pain intensity was measured using an 11-point numeric rating scale. We recorded effects on mood, sleep and quality of life, as well as adverse events. Results: We recruited 23 participants (mean age 45.4 [standard deviation 12.3] years, 12 women [52%]), of whom 21 completed the trial. The average daily pain intensity, measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale, was lower on the prespecified primary contrast of 9.4% v. 0% tetrahydrocannabinol (5.4 v. 6.1, respectively; difference = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-1.4). Preparations with intermediate potency yielded intermediate but nonsignificant degrees of relief. Participants receiving 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol reported improved ability to fall asleep (easier, p = 0.001; faster, p < 0.001; more drowsy, p = 0.003) and improved quality of sleep (less wakefulness, p = 0.01) relative to 0% tetrahydrocannabinol. We found no differences in mood or quality of life. The most common drug-related adverse events during the period when participants received 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol were headache, dry eyes, burning sensation in areas of neuropathic pain, dizziness, numbness and cough. Conclusion: A single inhalation of 25 mg of 9.4% tetrahydrocannabinol herbal cannabis three times daily for five days reduced the intensity of pain, improved sleep and was well tolerated. Further long-term safety and efficacy studies are indicated. (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register no.

Material and methods - A 16-year-old boy, his brother and mother were investigated. Thorough clinical investigation as well as electrophysiological, neuroradiological and myopathological examinations were performed. Molecular studies included the analysis of the DYT1, DDP1/TIMM8A (deafness-dystonia peptid-1) genes and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Results - The mtDNA analysis of the proband revealed a heteroplasmic A8332G substitution in the anticodon stem of the tRNALys gene. The mutation segregated in all affected family members. Besides this mutation 16 further mtDNA polymorphisms were detected. Complex I activity of the patient's fibroblast cultures showed decreased activity confirming mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusion - The novel A8332G heteroplasmic mutation is most likely a new cause of dystonia and stroke-like episodes due to mitochondrial encephalopathy. The synergistic effect of the G8697A, A11812G and T10463C single nucleotide polymorphisms may modify the phenotype.	[Gal, A.; Pentelenyi, K.; Remenyi, V.; Pal, Z.; Molnar, M.

Downregulation of oxytocin receptors in right ventricle of rats with monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension	ACTA PHYSIOLOGICA			English	Article						inflammation; monocrotaline; natriuretic peptides; nitric oxide; oxytocin; receptors	MYOCARDIAL FATTY-ACID; ATRIAL-NATRIURETIC-PEPTIDE; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; HEART-FAILURE; GENE-EXPRESSION; NITRIC-OXIDE; INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; PRESSURE-OVERLOAD; GLUCOSE-UPTAKE	Aim: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in the rat leads to right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, inflammation and increased natriuretic peptide (NP) levels in plasma and RV. Because the release of nitric oxide (NO) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a function of the oxytocin receptor (OTR), we examined the effect of PH on gene and protein expression of OTR, NP (A, atrial; B, brain) and receptors (NPRs), nitric oxide synthases (NOS), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in the hypertrophied RV in a model of PH. Methods: RV hypertrophy was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats with monocrotaline (MCT; 60 mg kg-1) and was confirmed by the presence of an increased RV weight and RV-to-[left ventricle (LV) and septum] ratio. Results: In the RV of MCT-treated rats, a similar to 40% reduction in OTR mRNA and protein was observed compared with the RV of control rats. This reduction was associated with increased transcripts of ANP and BNP in both ventricles and a corresponding increase in NP receptor mRNA expression for receptors A, B and C. Protein expression of inducible NOS was increased in the RV, whereas endothelial NOS transcripts were increased only in the LV of MCT-treated rats. In the RV of MCT-treated rats, downregulation of OTR was also associated with increased mRNA expression of IL-1 beta and IL-6. Conclusion: Our results show that downregulation of the OTR in the RV of MCT-treated rats is associated with increased expression of NP and their receptors as well as IL-1 beta and IL-6. This reduction in OTR in RV myocardium may have an impact on cardiac function in the MCT-induced model of PH.	[Broderick, T.

Epigenetic mechanisms may mediate some of the consequences of PEMCS through methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in genes important for brain development, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In the current study, we used bisulfite sequencing to assess DNA methylation of the BDNF promoter in the blood of adolescents whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. We demonstrate that PEMCS is associated with higher rates of DNA methylation in the BDNF-6 exon. These results suggest that PEMCS may lead to long-term down-regulation of BDNF expression via the increase of DNA methylation in its promoter region. Such mechanisms could, in turn, lead to modifications in both development and plasticity of the brain exposed in utero to maternal cigarette smoking. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We examined the effects of adult bone marrow-derived hMSCs on responses of primary human Th1, Th17, and Th1/17 double-expressing T-cell subsets, all implicated in MS. As expected, soluble products from hMSCs inhibited Th1 responses; however, Th17 responses were increased. Secretion of interleukin (IL)-10, considered anti-inflammatory, was decreased. Pretreating hMSCs with the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta accentuated these effects, and caused decreases in the Th1/17 subset. These findings underscore the importance of further preclinical work and immune-monitoring to define hMSC effects on disease-relevant immune responses under variable conditions.

Those involving intracranial nerves are even more exceptional. Little information is available concerning work up and management. Our objective is: (1) to review all cases of intracranial MPNST described in the literature, (2) to highlight the suspicion of intracranial MPNST, (3) to identify the gross pathology, the histopathology, the immunohistochemistry, (4) to discuss the differential diagnosis, the treatment, the recurrence rate, the follow-up, the incidence of metastasis and the prognosis. Methods: We reviewed English, Spanish and French literature published from I 950 to date. We used the following Keywords: "malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor", "cranial nerve", "neurosarcoma", "malignant schwannoma", "neurofibroma", "malignant neurofibroma" and "nerve tumor". We considered cases where MPNST involved an intracranial cranial nerve. The results yielded 20 relevant studies, in which 31 patient's records were transcribed. We also added our case to this series. Results: We identified 32 cases of cranial MPNST including our case. The age ranged from 5 to 75 years old with most patients being in the 5th and 6th decade. Male to female ratio is 2.5:1. Most cases are developed sporadically (50%), 31% arise from a malignant transformation of schwannoma and 19% from a neurofibroma. Imaging findings were not specific. The cranial nerve VIII is the most involved (15/32), followed by the Vth (10/32) and the VIIth (5/32). 4 cases had neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 had neurofibromatosis type 2. MPNST will strongly express protein S-100 and collagen IV-laminin. 13 cases were treated with radiotherapy for tumor recurrence and metastasis. In these cases the survival rate was better than the cases without radiotherapy. Fatal outcome occurred in 66% of patients whereas 19% were reported alive with or without complications. The seven cases reported to have metastasis were entirely to the spine. The mean time of recurrence or metastasis is 12.2 months. Conclusion: MPNST of cranial nerves are very rare. In neurofibroma, even though MPNST is mainly associated to type 1, we should keep in mind its association to NF2. Mainstay of treatment is radical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy. Inaccessibility of cranial MPNST may explain the subtotal resection and thus the poor prognosis. Metastasis to the spinal cord is the most frequent one. A close postoperative follow-up is mandatory to eliminate recurrence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spectral analysis was performed on 60s of artefact-free EEG samples distributed equally throughout the first four REM sleep periods of the second night. EEG coherence was calculated for six frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, sigma, beta, and total spectrum) using a 22-electrode montage. The magnitude of coherence function was computed for intra- and interhemispheric pairs of recording sites. Results were compared by Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). Each time the autistic group showed a greater EEG coherence than the controls; it involved intrahemispheric communication among the left visual cortex (O1) and other regions either close to or distant from the occipital cortex. In contrast, lower coherence values involved frontal electrodes in the right hemisphere. No significant differences between groups were found for interhemispheric EEG coherence. These results show that the analysis of EEG coherence during REM sleep can disclose patterns of cortical connectivity that can be reduced or increased in adults with autism compared to typically developed individuals, depending of the cortical areas studied. Superior coherence involving visual perceptual areas in autism is consistent with an enhanced role of perception in autistic brain organization.

Recent evidence suggests that changes in DNA methylation patterns are involved in human disease through altering normal gene expression programming. In contrast to genetic changes aberrant DNA methylation patterns are potentially reversible raising the hope for DNA methylation based therapeutics. It was previously believed that the only relevant DNA methylation reaction in mature cells is DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), which accurately copies the DNA methylation pattern during cell division. The major effort in the field has therefore focused on developing DNMT inhibitors for cancer a disease of mitotic cells. However, recent evidence suggests that the DNA methylation state in both mitotic and postmitotic cells is a balance of DNA methylating and demethylating activities. This expands the scope of DNMT inhibitors to postmitotic tissues such as the brain. Since the identity of the DNA demethylating activity is still a mystery, the development of DNA demethylation inhibitors has been lagging. This review will discuss DNA methylation and demethylation machineries, and their therapeutic potentials as targets for small molecule inhibitors. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Synapse Dis Team	De Novo Truncating Mutation in Kinesin 17 Associated with Schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						De novo; KIF17; kinesin; NMDA; schizophrenia; synapse	FAMILY-BASED ASSOCIATION; MOTOR PROTEIN KIF17; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; MESSENGER-RNA; GENE; RECEPTORS; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION	Background: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. It is thought to be due to a complex interplay between polygenic and various environmental risk factors, although recent reports on genomic copy number variations suggest that a fraction of the cases could result from variably penetrant de novo variants. The gene encoding the synaptic motor protein kinesin 17 (KIF17) involved in glutamatergic synapse is a candidate gene for SCZ. Methods: As part of our Synapse to Disease project, we resequenced KIF17 in a cohort of individuals with sporadic SCZ (188 subjects). Additional populations included autism spectrum disorder (142 subjects), nonsyndromic mental retardation (95 subjects), and control subjects (568 subjects). Functional validation of the human mutation was done in developing zebrafish. Results: Here we report the identification of a de novo nonsense truncating mutation in one patient with SCZ, in kinesin 17, a synaptic motor protein. No de novo or truncating KIF17 mutations were found in the additional samples. We further validated the pathogenic nature of this mutation by knocking down its expression in zebrafish embryos, which resulted in a developmental defect. Conclusions: Together our findings suggest that disruption of KIF17, although rare, could result in a schizophrenia phenotype and emphasize the possible involvement of rare de novo mutations in this disorder.

Participants: One hundred and ninety-three patients with optic neuritis (ON) as a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) (n = 63), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (n = 108), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) (n = 13), and primary progressive MS (PPMS) (n = 9). Methods: All patients underwent standardized ophthalmic, neurological, and OCT testing at a single academic institution. Results: RNFL values were reduced in PPMS (94.3 mu m), RRMS (99.6 mu m), and SPMS eyes (84.7 mu m) relative to CIS eyes (105.7 mu m) (p < 0.0001). RNFL values were lower in eyes with recurrent ON (64.2 mu m) relative to eyes affected by a single ON event (86.3 mu m) (p < 0.0001). The strongest correlation between RNFL thickness and neurological disability occurred in RRMS patients (r = -0.51, p < 0.0001). RNFL thickness correlated with visual field sensitivity for CIS (r = 0.23, p < 0.01) and RRMS (r = 0.22, p < 0.01) patients. Simple linear regression showed that every 10 pm decrease in RNFL correlated with a 5.8 decibel decrease in visual field sensitivity (adjusted R(2) = 0.35, p < 0.0001) for RNFL values less than 75 mu m. Conclusions: There were robust correlations between RNFL thickness and visual function, particularly in ON eyes. OCT may complement the existing tools used to characterize MS patients, but further studies are needed.

J	Zargham, R				Zargham, Ramin			Tensegrin in context Dual role of alpha 8 integrin in the migration of different cell types	CELL ADHESION & MIGRATION			English	Review						integrin; migration; adhesion; mesenchymal cell; epithelial cell; vascular smooth muscle cell		alpha 8b1 integrin is highly expressed in cells with contractile function, such as mesangial cells of the kidneys and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Although it promotes migration of neural crest cells and breast cancer cells, recent studies suggest that alpha 8 integrin has a negative regulatory role in VSMC migration. In this Review, the question of why alpha 8b1 integrin plays a dual role in cell migration is raised and discussed. It seems that cells require optimum contractility and balanced tensile forces for migration. alpha 8b1 integrin promotes migration of cells that are initially in a less than optimal contractile state (e. g., neural cells) and reduces the migration of cells known as contractile cells. alpha 8b1 integrin can be called "Tensegrin" as it fits perfectly into the tensegrity model (tensional integrity) and seems to play a prominent role in the integration of the tensile forces.

It is not clearly known, however, to what extent IPS activation reflects VSTM for object identity (What) versus spatial location (Where) information. The present study was designed to manipulate selectively the amount of What and Where information retained in VSTM in order to determine, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the effect of VSTM for each of these 2 dimensions on IPS activation. The results showed an increase in IPS activation only in response to increasing Where memory load, with no effect of What load suggesting that capacity-related activation in the IPS primarily reflects the amount of spatial information retained in VSTM.

A Prospective Study of the Herpes Zoster Severity of Illness	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						herpes zoster; pain; burden; postherpetic neuralgia	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; NATURAL-HISTORY; UNITED-KINGDOM; OLDER-ADULTS; RISK-FACTORS; LONG-TERM; PAIN; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Objective: MASTER, a multicenter prospective study, was conducted to provide a thorough understanding of the burden of herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Objectives are to: (1) describe the herpes zoster severity-of-illness (HZSOI), a composite measure of pain duration and severity; and (2) to identify the characteristics at recruitment predictive of greater HZSOI at the different phases of HZ. Methods: From October, 2005 to July, 2006, 261 outpatients with HZ, aged more than equal to 50 years, were recruited within 14 days of rash onset across Canada. The pain was measured by the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory at recruitment and 7, 14, 21, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 days later. The HZSOI represents the area under the curve of pain severity over time and ranges from 0 (no pain) to 1800 (pain = 10 for 180 d). Results: Median pain duration was 32.5 days. The predictors of greater HZSOI varied according to the different phases of HZ. Higher pain severity at recruitment, more lesions, lower income, and being immunocompromised were the predictors of a greater acute HZSOI. Higher acute pain severity, lower income, being immunocompromised, older age, and not receiving antivirals were the predictors of greater postherpetic HZSOI. Discussion: Using an informative measure capturing simultaneously the burden caused by pain duration and severity, we identified subgroups that suffer most during the different phases of HZ. It is interesting to note that, younger participants were as likely to suffer as the older ones during the acute phase of HZ. This information should aid in optimizing the treatment and prevention of HZ.

It does not seek to establish a comprehensive classification of sensory neuropathies, nor treatment guidelines per se. Recent findings Diagnostic criteria and guidelines have been developed for distal symmetric polyneuropathies, small fiber sensory neuropathies and sensory neuronopathies. Novel diagnostic tools such as skin biopsies now allow diagnosis of small fiber sensory neuropathies. Genetic testing has defined new subtypes of mitochondrial neuropathies and inherited neuropathies with sensory involvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors show promise for some dysimmune sensory neuropathies or neuronopathies. Additional options for management of neuropathic pain are emerging. Summary Diagnostic methods for both acquired and hereditary sensory neuropathies have progressed in recent years, leading to earlier and more specific diagnoses and a better understanding of disease mechanisms. Much progress remains to be made regarding symptomatic and disease-modifying therapy for a range of sensory neuropathies, including those due to diabetes, HIV infection and from dysimmune or hereditary causes.

Retinoic acid receptors appear to be present in cnidarians and NO plays various physiological roles in several cnidarians, but there is as yet no evidence that these agents have a role in neural development in this basal metazoan phylum. We used primary cultures of cells from the sea pansy Renilla koellikeri to investigate the involvement of these signaling molecules in cnidarian cell differentiation. We found that 9-cis RA induce cell proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manners in dishes coated with polylysine from the onset of culture. Cells in cultures exposed to RA in dishes devoid of polylysine were observed to differentiate into epithelium-associated cells, including sensory cells, without net gain in cell density. NO donors also induce cell proliferation in polylysine-coated dishes, but induce neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth in uncoated dishes. No other cell type undergoes differentiation in the presence of NO. These observations suggest that in the sea pansy (1) cell adhesion promotes proliferation without morphogenesis and this proliferation is modulated positively by 9-cis RA and NO, (2) 9-cis RA and NO differentially induce neuronal differentiation in nonadherent cells while repressing proliferation, and (3) the involvement of RA and NO in neuronal differentiation appeared early during the evolutionary emergence of nervous systems.

M.; Yoshino, Hiroshi			A decision tree method for building energy demand modeling	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Building energy consumption; Modeling; Decision tree; Classification analysis	ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORK; CONSUMPTION; REGRESSION; SIMULATION; VALIDATION	This paper reports the development of a building energy demand predictive model based on the decision tree method. This method is able to classify and predict categorical variables: its competitive advantage over other widely used modeling techniques, such as regression method and ANN method, lies in the ability to generate accurate predictive models with interpretable flowchart-like tree structures that enable users to quickly extract useful information. To demonstrate its applicability, the method is applied to estimate residential building energy performance indexes by modeling building energy use intensity (EUI) levels. The results demonstrate that the use of decision tree method can classify and predict building energy demand levels accurately (93% for training data and 92% for test data), identify and rank significant factors of building EUI automatically. The method can provide the combination of significant factors as well as the threshold values that will lead to high building energy performance. Moreover, the average EUI value of data records in each classified data subsets can be used for reference when performing prediction. One crucial benefit is improving building energy performance and reducing energy consumption. Another advantage of this methodology is that it can be utilized by users without requiring much computation knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although previous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) studies showed that thalamus, default mode areas, and caudate nuclei are involved in absence seizures, the contribution of these regions throughout the ictal evolution of absences remains unclear. Furthermore, animal models provide evidence that absences are initiated by a cortical focus with a secondary involvement of the thalamus. The aim of this study was to investigate dynamic changes during absences. Methods: Seventeen absences from nine patients with absence epilepsy and classical pattern of 3-4 Hz GSWs during EEG-fMRI recording were included in the study. The absences were studied in a sliding window analysis, providing a temporal sequence of blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response maps. Results: Thalamic activation was found in 16 absences (94%), deactivation in default mode areas in 15 (88%), deactivation of the caudate nuclei in 10 (59%), and cortical activation in patient-specific areas in 10 (59%) of the absences. Cortical activations and deactivations in default mode areas and caudate nucleus occurred significantly earlier than thalamic responses. Discussion: Like a fingerprint, patient-specific BOLD signal changes were remarkably consistent in space and time across different absences of one patient but were quite different from patient to patient, despite having similar EEG pattern and clinical semiology. Early frontal activations could support the cortical focus theory, but with an addition: This early activation is patient specific.

Methods: The follow-up period ranged from 3-7 years postsurgery. Results: Two participants had a verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) > 100 and three had a verbal IQ between 65 and 80. All five children had abnormal nonverbal IQ and exhibited deficits related to visual attention, object recognition, and praxis. Nevertheless, our results suggest that brain plasticity after parietooccipital epilepsy surgery in young children allows for a schooling level of cognitive skills such as reading and arithmetic. Discussion: Although recovery for visual perceptual cognition was more limited than for verbal functions, long-term neuropsychological outcomes showed that early surgery for epilepsy offers the possibility of optimizing cognitive outcomes in children with posterior intractable epilepsies.

Since the effect of quetiapine on central reward function is largely unknown we studied its effects on brain stimulation reward in animals under withdrawal from escalating doses of n-amphetamine. Male Sprague Dawley rats were trained to produce an operant response to receive a short train of electrical stimulation to the lateral hypothalamus. Measures of reward threshold were determined with the curve-shift method in different groups of rats before, and during four days after treatment with escalating doses (1 to 10 mg/kg, i.p.) of o-amphetamine or its vehicle. At 24 h of withdrawal, the effects of two doses of quetiapine (2 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) were tested. Animals treated with n-amphetamine showed a 25% reward deficit at 24 h of withdrawal, an effect that decreased progressively over the next three days. Quetiapine attenuated reward in the vehicle-control animals, and amplified the anhedonia at the moderate, but not the low, dose in the animals under withdrawal. These results show that acute treatment with clinically relevant doses of quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia may exacerbate anhedonia induced by amphetamine withdrawal. Further research should investigate whether repeated treatment with quetiapine has the ability to reverse amphetamine withdrawal-induced anhedonia. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Here, we report a similar phenomenon in the tactile modality. When scanning a single Braille dot with two fingers of the same hand, participants were asked to decide whether the dot was stationary or whether it was displaced from one location to another. The stimulus was produced by refreshable Braille devices that have dots that can be swiftly raised and recessed. In some conditions, the dot was stationary. In others, a displacement was created by monitoring the participant's finger position and by switching the dot activation when it was not touched by either finger. The dot displacement was of either 2.5 mm or 5 mm. We found that in certain cases, displaced dots were felt to be stationary. If the displacement was orthogonal to the finger movements, tactile suppression occurred effectively when it was of 2.5 mm, but when the displacement was of 5 mm, the participants easily detected it. If the displacement was medial-lateral, the suppression effect occurred as well, but less often when the apparent movement of the dot opposed the movement of the finger. In such cases, the stimulus appeared sooner than when the brain could predict it from finger movement, supporting a predictive rather than a postdictive differential processing hypothesis.

J	Bastianetto, S; Quirion, R				Bastianetto, Stephane; Quirion, Remi			Heme oxygenase 1: Another possible target to explain the neuroprotective action of resveratrol, a multifaceted nutrient-based molecule	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Editorial Material							PROTEIN-KINASE-C; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; GLUCOSE DEPRIVATION; WINE CONSUMPTION; RAT-BRAIN; POLYPHENOLS; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION	Resveratrol, a polyphenol present in red wine, has received much attention lately because of its putative preventive role in the purported link between moderate red wine consumption and lower incidence of neurological disorders such as dementia and stroke. Numerous animal and in vitro studies have shown that this polyphenol is neuroprotective and can reverse various types of cognitive deficits. However, the mechanism(s) of action involved in the multiple effects of resveratrol is not fully understood. In a recent article by Sakata and colleagues in Experimental Neurology (Sakata, Y., Zhuang, H., Kwansa, H., Koehler, R.C, Dore, S., 2010. Resveratrol protects against experimental stroke: putative neuroprotective role of heme oxygenase 1. Exp. Neurol. 224, 325-329.), the authors raise a hypothesis that the induction of heme oxygenase 1, an endogenous enzyme that provides resistance against oxidative stress-related neuronal damage, contributes, at least in part, to the neuroprotective action of resveratrol. Our brief commentary summarizes recent findings on intracellular pathways possibly involved in the effects of a multi-functional molecule, such as resveratrol, and highlights their relevance in various age-related neurological disorders.

BDNF regulation under GFAP promoter provides engineered astrocytes as a new approach for long-term protection in Huntington's disease	GENE THERAPY			English	Article						neurotrophin; cell therapy; excitotoxicity	STRIATAL PROJECTION NEURONS; NEURAL STEM-CELLS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; TRANSGENIC MICE; MOUSE MODEL; RAT MODEL; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; MUTANT HUNTINGTIN; GENE DELIVERY	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the main candidate for neuroprotective therapeutic strategies for Huntington's disease. However, the administration system and the control over the dosage are still important problems to be solved. Here we generated transgenic mice over-expressing BDNF under the promoter of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (pGFAP-BDNF mice). These mice are viable and have a normal phenotype. However, intrastriatal administration of quinolinate increased the number of reactive astrocytes and enhanced the release of BDNF in pGFAP-BDNF mice compared with wild-type mice. Coincidentally, pGFAP-BDNF mice are more resistant to quinolinate than wild-type mice, suggesting a protective effect of astrocyte-derived BDNF. To verify this, we next cultured astrocytes from pGFAP-BDNF and wild-type mice for grafting. Wild-type and pGFAP-BDNF-derived astrocytes behave similarly in nonlesioned mice. However, pGFAP-BDNF-derived astrocytes showed higher levels of BDNF and larger neuroprotective effects than the wild-type ones when quinolinate was injected 30 days after grafting. Interestingly, mice grafted with pGFAP-BDNF astrocytes showed important and sustained behavioral improvements over time after quinolinate administration as compared with mice grafted with wild-type astrocytes. These findings show that astrocytes engineered to release BDNF can constitute a therapeutic approach for Huntington's disease.

Loss of the Parkinson's disease-linked gene DJ-1 perturbs mitochondrial dynamics	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							OXIDATIVE STRESS; CELL-DEATH; PINK1/PARKIN PATHWAY; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; PROTEIN DJ-1; PINK1; AUTOPHAGY; FISSION; DYSFUNCTION; NEURONS	Growing evidence highlights a role for mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as underlying contributors to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. DJ-1 (PARK7) is a recently identified recessive familial PD gene. Its loss leads to increased susceptibility of neurons to oxidative stress and death. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Presently, we report that DJ-1 deficiency in cell lines, cultured neurons, mouse brain and lymphoblast cells derived from DJ-1 patients display aberrant mitochondrial morphology. We also show that these DJ-1-dependent mitochondrial defects contribute to oxidative stress-induced sensitivity to cell death since reversal of this fragmented mitochondrial phenotype abrogates neuronal cell death. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) appear to play a critical role in the observed defects, as ROS scavengers rescue the phenotype and mitochondria isolated from DJ-1 deficient animals produce more ROS compared with control. Importantly, the aberrant mitochondrial phenotype can be rescued by the expression of Pink1 and Parkin, two PD-linked genes involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and quality control. Finally, we show that DJ-1 deficiency leads to altered autophagy in murine and human cells. Our findings define a mechanism by which the DJ-1-dependent mitochondrial defects contribute to the increased sensitivity to oxidative stress-induced cell death that has been previously reported.

Risk of axillary nerve injury during percutaneous proximal humerus locking plate insertion using an external aiming guide	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Aiming arm; Deltoid-splitting approach; Neurological injury; Fracture reduction; Minimally invasive	INTERNAL-FIXATION; PHILOS PLATE; FRACTURES; HEAD	Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine which screws could be safely inserted percutaneously into a proximal humerus locking plate using a new external aiming guide without injuring the axillary nerve. We also sought to evaluate that all the screws could be accurately inserted in a locked position with the external guide. Methods: Eight cadaveric specimens were implanted with a proximal humerus locking plate using a minimally invasive direct-lateral deltoid splitting approach using an attached external aiming guide for screw insertion. The anatomic proximity of the axillary nerve to the guidewires and screws was measured following soft tissue dissection and inspection of the nerve. Results: The two superior holes (C1 and C2) were proximal to the axillary nerve with an average distance of 15.1 mm. Screw F was on average 6.6 mm distal to the axillary nerve but within 2 mm of the nerve in two specimens. In all specimens, the locking screws were appropriately seated in a locked position using the external aiming guide. Conclusions: This study suggests that percutaneous fixation of a proximal humerus locking plate with an external aiming guide can be safely used for proximal humerus fractures. The limited number of screws that can be inserted into the proximal fragment using the current external guide arm may compromise fixation of more unstable fractures. Therefore, the indications for percutaneous locking plate fixation of the proximal humerus using an external aiming guide should be limited to stable fracture patterns that can be anatomically reduced.

Consensus methods may be a viable means to reconcile the perceptions of different stakeholders about the dimensions to include in a performance evaluation framework. Objectives: To determine whether individual organizations within traumatic brain injury (TBI) networks differ in perceptions about the importance of performance dimensions for the evaluation of TBI networks and to explore the extent to which group consensus sessions could reconcile these perceptions. Methods: We used TRIAGE, a consensus technique that combines an individual and a group data collection phase to explore the perceptions of network stakeholders and to reach a consensus within structured group discussions. Results: One hundred and thirty-nine professionals from 43 organizations within eight TBI networks participated in the individual data collection; 62 professionals from these same organisations contributed to the group data collection. The extent of consensus based on questionnaire results (e.g. individual data collection) was low, however, 100% agreement was obtained for each network during the consensus group sessions. The median importance scores and mean ranks attributed to the dimensions by individuals compared to groups did not differ greatly. Group discussions were found useful in understanding the reasons motivating the scoring, for resolving differences among participants, and for harmonizing their values. Conclusion: Group discussions, as part of a consensus technique, appear to be a useful process to reconcile diverging perceptions of network performance among stakeholders.

J	Jemel, B; Schuller, AM; Goffaux, V				Jemel, Boutheina; Schuller, Anne-Marie; Goffaux, Valerie			Characterizing the Spatio-temporal Dynamics of the Neural Events Occurring prior to and up to Overt Recognition of Famous Faces	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS; UNFAMILIAR FACES; FACIAL RECOGNITION; COVERT RECOGNITION; FAMILIAR FACES; OBJECT-RECOGNITION; PERSON RECOGNITION; ERP EVIDENCE; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION	Although it is generally acknowledged that familiar face recognition is fast, mandatory, and proceeds outside conscious control, it is still unclear whether processes leading to familiar face recognition occur in a linear (i.e., gradual) or a nonlinear (i.e., all-or-none) manner. To test these two alternative accounts, we recorded scalp ERPs while participants indicated whether they recognize as familiar the faces of famous and unfamiliar persons gradually revealed in a descending sequence of frames, from the noisier to the least noisy. This presentation procedure allowed us to characterize the changes in scalp ERP responses occurring prior to and up to overt recognition. Our main finding is that gradual and all-or- none processes are possibly involved during overt recognitionof familiar faces. Although the N170 and the N250 face-sensitive responses displayed an abrupt activity change at the moment of overt recognition of famous faces, later ERPs encompassing the N400 and late positive component exhibited an incremental increase in amplitude as the point of recognition approached. In addition, famous faces that were not overtly recognized at one trial before recognition elicited larger ERP potentials than unfamiliar faces, probably reflecting a covert recognition process. Overall, these findings present evidence that recognition of familiar faces implicates spatio-temporally complex neural processes exhibiting differential pattern activity changes as a function of recognition state.

Almost 20 years ago, insights from studies on brain lesion patients set the cornerstone for this stream of research and led to the formulation of the somatic marker hypothesis. Despite some debate, the somatic marker framework is still providing a unique neuroanatomical and cognitive framework that helps explain the role of emotion in decision-making. In this article, we review the neurological background, core mechanisms, and critiques of the somatic marker theory, put into perspective conceptually related approaches that link emotion to decision-making, and present an outlook for future neuroeconomics research.

The diagnosis is often difficult, and consequences for the patient can be severe. Case Report: We describe the case of a 35-year-old female physician who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) in severe hemodynamic compromise, with an altered level of consciousness and major expressive aphasia 1 day after undergoing a leg varicosal stripping procedure under regional anesthesia. She was successfully thrombolyzed with 0.9 mg/kg of Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rtPA, Alteplase) and had a full recovery. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first description of a case of massive pulmonary embolism associated with a paradoxical stroke related to patent foramen ovale that was thrombolyzed for both conditions with a "neurological dose" of rtPA. Although thrombolysis was completely successful in this case, indications and contraindications should be thoroughly respected. A more conservative approach with anticoagulation, or a more aggressive approach with surgical thrombectomy, can each potentially have a place in particular cases. Intraarterial catheter-directed thrombolysis and percutaneous embolectomy are additional options to be considered when available, especially if there are contraindications for systemic thrombolysis.

Geographic variation in phenotypic plasticity in response to dissolved oxygen in an African cichlid fish	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						adaptive divergence; adaptive plasticity; brain; dispersal; gene flow; gills; hypoxia; local adaptation; natural selection; reaction norms	WILD BIRD POPULATION; GENE FLOW; ADAPTIVE DIVERGENCE; STREAM STICKLEBACK; LOCAL ADAPTATION; NATURAL-SELECTION; PSEUDOCRENILABRUS-MULTICOLOR; EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE; QUANTITATIVE TRAITS; PUNGITIUS-PUNGITIUS	Genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two ways in which organisms can adapt to local environmental conditions. We examined genetic and plastic variation in gill and brain size among swamp (low oxygen; hypoxic) and river (normal oxygen; normoxic) populations of an African cichlid fish, Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae. Larger gills and smaller brains should be advantageous when oxygen is low, and we hypothesized that the relative contribution of local genetic adaptation vs. phenotypic plasticity should be related to potential for dispersal between environments (because of gene flow's constraint on local genetic adaptation). We conducted a laboratory-rearing experiment, with broods from multiple populations raised under high-oxygen and low-oxygen conditions. We found that most of the variation in gill size was because of plasticity. However, both plastic and genetic effects on brain mass were detected, as were genetic effects on brain mass plasticity. F(1) offspring from populations with the highest potential for dispersal between environments had characteristically smaller and more plastic brains. This phenotypic pattern might be adaptive in the face of gene flow, if smaller brains and increased plasticity confer higher average fitness across environment types.	[Crispo, E.; Chapman, L.

Daily rhythmic PER2 expression in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) is abolished with the removal of the adrenal glands but restored with rhythmic hormone replacement via the drinking water at a time corresponding to the endogenous peak of circulating glucocorticoids. Here, we investigated the effects of serial or acute systemic injections of corticosterone on the expression of PER2 in the BNSTov and CEA of both adrenalectomized (ADX) and intact rats. We sought to determine whether there is a temporal window of corticosterone sensitivity by delivering the hormone at a time corresponding to trough levels of circulating glucocorticoids, at lights on. We found that daily morning injections of corticosterone induced PER2 expression in the BNSTov and CEA of ADX rats, with levels peaking 1 h after injection. In intact rats, daily morning injections significantly upregulated the expression of PER2 in the BNSTov and CEA 1 h after injection and dampened the evening peak, while a single injection abolished the rhythm of PER2 expression in the CEA but had no effect on PER2 in the BNSTov. Our findings suggest that despite the potential masking effect of signals from the light-entrained master clock, daytime chronic and acute corticosterone administration can alter the rhythmic expression of PER2 in the BNSTov and CEA, and that the response is region-specific and dependent on the duration of treatment.

The present study was designed to characterize the pharmacological properties of sensory neuron-specific receptors (SNSR; also known as Mas-related gene receptors, or Mrg) for their modulation in the development of morphine tolerance and to investigate the underlying mechanism(s). Daily coadministration of the SNSR agonist BAM8-22 at a dose of 0.01 or 0.001, but not 1.0, nmol with morphine (intrathecally, or i.t., 20 mu g/day) for 6 days significantly decreased the development of morphine tolerance. Coadnninistration of BAM8-22 (i.t., 1.0 nmol) on days 1, 3, and 5 completely blocked tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia. Intermittent coadministration of the structurally dissimilar SNSR agonist (Tyr(6))-2-MSH-6-12 (MSH; 5 nmol) also produced similar modulation. Chronic administration of morphine (20 mu g, it.) increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in superficial layers of the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. All these increases were abolished when BAM8-22 or MSH was intermittently coadministered. Furthermore, intermittent administration of BAM8-22 inhibited morphine-induced increase in protein kinase (PKC-gamma) in both membrane and cytosol of spinal dorsal horn neurons. These results suggest that moderate activation of SNSR modulated morphine tolerance by inhibition of the PKC signaling pathway, leading to abolishment of enhancement of nNOS and CGRP. As SNSR are uniquely located in a subset of small-sized neurons in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, intermittent combination of SNSR agonist could be a promising adjunct for sustained use of opiates without central nervous system side effects.

Intracranial hypertension can be caused by SEGAs due to their propensity to block the foramen of Monro. The traditional management approach is to monitor SEGAs with periodic neuroimaging and to resect those that exhibit serial growth and/or cause clinical signs of intracranial hypertension. Recent observations suggest that rapamycin therapy may induce partial regression of SEGAs, therefore providing a potential alternative to resection. The authors present the case of an 8-year-old girl with bilateral SEGAs that led to progressive hydrocephaly and incipient signs of papilledema. Three months after initiating rapamycin therapy, the SEGAs exhibited significant reduction in size (82.6% on the left and 46.7% on the right), and the lesions remained stable 5 months later. Compared with previous case reports, similar or even greater antitumor efficacy was achieved with much lower trough levels of rapamycin (10-15 compared with 3.3-4.5 ng/ml, respectively). The authors discuss various aspects of rapamycin therapy and address unresolved issues that highlight the need for further prospective clinical trials.

The combination of algorithms chosen can be implemented in real time, so that it can be used in an augmented reality 3D representation to assist physicians performing these interventions. A ribbon-like morphing process combined with a minimal path optimization algorithm is used to track lateral motion between successive frames. Forward motions are then tracked with an endpoint tracking algorithm, based on a circular window processed with the Radon transform. The proposed method was tested on 6 fluoroscopic sequences presenting high-speed motions, which were saved during endovascular brain interventions. The experiments showed above-average precision and robust guidewire tracking, without any permanent error requiring manual correction. (c) 2010 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tremblay, J; Hamet, P				Tremblay, Johanne; Hamet, Pavel			Genetics of pain, opioids, and opioid responsiveness	METABOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL			English	Article							POLYMORPHISM; IDENTIFICATION; ANALGESIA; MORPHINE; GENES; SCN9A	Pain is an integral part of the defense mechanisms required for survival. Several hereditary syndromes of complete or almost complete insensitivity to pain have been identified and include channelopathy-associated pain insensitivity, of which the most likely candidate gene is the a-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel known as Na(v)1.7. Five hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy syndromes have been described. Variable pain sensitivity in the general population has been linked to common variants of the mu-opioid receptor and of the catecholamine-O-methyltransferase genes potentially leading to increased opioid tonus. Variants of the guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1/dopa-responsive dystonia gene appear to regulate nociception. Other candidate genes are the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily 5 member 1, gene and the melanocortin-1 receptor gene. Candidate genes for predicting opioid efficacy are drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters-including cytochrome P450, uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases, and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters-that are involved in opioid metabolism. Most current knowledge on the genetic regulation of pain has been derived from animal models developed mainly in mice. Genomics has the potential to contribute to therapeutic advances with the promising approach of using small interfering RNA in the control of neuropathic pain. Knowledge of the genetic factors that affect opioid efficacy, metabolism, and adverse effects has the potential for personalizing both acute and chronic pain management, and for designing more useful opiate pain medications with lower adverse event profiles.

After challenge with West Nile virus (WNV), caspase-12-deficient mice had greater mortality, higher viral burden and defective type I interferon response compared with those of challenged wild-type mice. In vitro studies of primary neurons and mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed that caspase-12 positively modulated the production of type I interferon by regulating E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I, a critical signaling event for the type I interferon response to WNV and other important viral pathogens.

A dominant-negative mutation in the TRESK potassium channel is linked to familial migraine with aura	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							DOMAIN K+ CHANNEL; HEMIPLEGIC MIGRAINE; SPREADING DEPRESSION; ACTIVATION; HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY; CALCINEURIN; ANESTHETICS; CURRENTS; TYPE-2; LONG	Migraine with aura is a common, debilitating, recurrent headache disorder associated with transient and reversible focal neurological symptoms(1). A role has been suggested for the two-pore domain (K2P) potassium channel, TWIK-related spinal cord potassium channel (TRESK, encoded by KCNK18), in pain pathways and general anaesthesia(2). We therefore examined whether TRESK is involved in migraine by screening the KCNK18 gene in subjects diagnosed with migraine. Here we report a frameshift mutation, F139WfsX24, which segregates perfectly with typical migraine with aura in a large pedigree. We also identified prominent TRESK expression in migraine-salient areas such as the trigeminal ganglion. Functional characterization of this mutation demonstrates that it causes a complete loss of TRESK function and that the mutant subunit suppresses wild-type channel function through a dominant-negative effect, thus explaining the dominant penetrance of this allele. These results therefore support a role for TRESK in the pathogenesis of typical migraine with aura and further support the role of this channel as a potential therapeutic target.

The clinical features invariably include upper motor neuron signs and developmental regression with or without other neurological manifestations. The objective of this study was to characterize clinically and genetically a new form of childhood-onset leukodystrophy with ataxia and tremor. We recruited seven French-Canadian cases belonging to five families affected by an unknown form of childhood-onset leukodystrophy. Genome-wide scans (GWS) were performed using the Illumina Hap310 or Hap610 Bead Chip to identify regions of shared homozygosity that were further studied for linkage with STS markers. All cases presented between the ages of 1 and 5 years with spasticity along with other upper motor neuron signs, prominent postural tremor, and cerebellar signs. Though motor regression is a constant feature, cognitive functions are relatively preserved, even late in the course of the disease. The higher frequency of founder diseases in the French-Canadian population and the segregation in pedigrees are suggestive of a recessive mode of inheritance. By homozygosity mapping, we established linkage to a 12.6-Mb SNP-haplotyped region on chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31 (maximum LOD score: 5.47). We describe an autosomal recessive childhood-onset leukodystrophy with ataxia and tremor mapping to a 12.6 Mb interval on chromosome 10q22.3-10q23.31. Identification of the mutated gene will allow precise diagnosis and genetic counseling and shed light on how its perturbed function leads to white matter abnormalities.

Fundamental to all available techniques is the accurate segmentation of GM in the brain, a difficult task confounded even further by the pathology present in the brains of MS patients. In this paper, we examine the segmentations of six different automated techniques and compare them to a manually defined reference standard. Results demonstrate that, although the algorithms perform similarly to manual segmentations of cortical GM, severe shortcomings are present in the segmentation of deep GM structures. This deficiency is particularly relevant given the current interest in the role of GM in MS and the numerous reports of atrophy in deep GM structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This approach, however, involves subjective judgment in the tract-editing process to extract only the tracts of interest. This process, usually performed by manual delineation of regions of interest, is also time-consuming, and certain tracts, especially the short cortico-cortical association fibers, are difficult to reconstruct. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for reconstruction of a large number of white matter tracts. In this approach, existing anatomical knowledge about tract trajectories (called the Template ROI Set or TRS) were stored in our DTI-based brain atlas with 130 three-dimensional anatomical segmentations, which were warped non-linearly to individual DTI data. We examined the degree of matching with manual results for selected fibers. We established 30 TRSs to reconstruct 30 prominent and previously well-described fibers. In addition, TRSs were developed to delineate 29 short association fibers that were found in all normal subjects examined in this paper (N = 20). Probabilistic maps of the 59 tract trajectories were created from the normal subjects and were incorporated into our image analysis tool for automated tract-specific quantification.

Towards accurate, automatic segmentation of the hippocampus and amygdala from MRI by augmenting ANIMAL with a template library and label fusion	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN SEGMENTATION; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; ATLAS SELECTION; REGISTRATION; VOLUME; VALIDATION; ATROPHY	We describe progress towards fully automatic segmentation of the hippocampus (HC) and amygdala (AG) in human subjects from MRI data. Three methods are described and tested with a set of MRIs from 80 young normal controls, using manual labeling of the HC and AG as a gold standard. The methods include: 1) our ANIMAL atlas-based method that uses non-linear registration to a pre-labeled non-linear average template (ICBM152). HC and AG labels, defined on the template are mapped through the inverse transformation to segment these structures on the subject's MRI. 2) We select the most similar MRI from the set of 80 labeled datasets to use as a template in the standard ANIMAL segmentation scheme. 3) We use label fusion techniques to combine segmentations from the 'n' most similar templates. The label fusion technique yields an optimal median Dice Kappa of 0.886 and similarity of 0.795 for HC, and 0.826 and 0.703 respectively for AG. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Orientationally invariant indices of axon diameter and density from diffusion MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Diffusion MRI; Active imaging; Axon diameter; Fibre density; White matter; Microstructure	HUMAN CORPUS-CALLOSUM; BRAIN WHITE-MATTER; RESTRICTED DIFFUSION; FIBER COMPOSITION; SPIN-ECHO; WATER DIFFUSION; FIELD-GRADIENT; RAT-BRAIN; SIZE; SCLEROSIS	This paper proposes and tests a technique for imaging orientationally invariant indices of axon diameter and density in white matter using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Such indices potentially provide more specific markers of white matter microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging. Orientational invariance allows for combination with tractography and presents new opportunities for mapping brain connectivity and quantifying disease processes. The technique uses a four-compartment tissue model combined with an optimized multishell high-angular-resolution pulsed-gradient-spin-echo acquisition. We test the method in simulation, on fixed monkey brains using a preclinical scanner and on live human brains using a clinical 3 T scanner. The human data take about one hour to acquire. The simulation experiments show that both monkey and human protocols distinguish distributions of axon diameters that occur naturally in white matter. We compare the axon diameter index with the mean axon diameter weighted by axon volume. The index differs from this mean and is protocol dependent, but correlation is good for the monkey protocol and weaker, but discernible, for the human protocol where greater diffusivity and lower gradient strength limit sensitivity to only the largest axons. Maps of axon diameter and density indices from the monkey and human data in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract reflect known trends from histology. The results show orientationally invariant sensitivity to natural axon diameter distributions for the first time with both specialist and clinical hardware. This demonstration motivates further refinement, validation, and evaluation of the precise nature of the indices and the influence of potential confounds. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Auditory evoked fields to vocalization during passive listening and active generation in adults who stutter	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Stuttering; Speech motor control; Auditory processing; Auditory M50; Auditory M100; Magnetoencephalography (MEG)	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; SPEECH PRODUCTION; MOTOR CONTROL; NONSTUTTERING ADULTS; SYLLABLE PRODUCTION; VERBAL FEEDBACK; FLUENT SPEAKERS; VOICE KEY	We used magnetoencephalography to investigate auditory evoked responses to speech vocalizations and non-speech tones in adults who do and do not stutter. Neuromagnetic field patterns were recorded as participants listened to a 1 kHz tone, playback of their own productions of the vowel /i/ and vowel-initial words, and actively generated the vowel /i/ and vowel-initial words. Activation of the auditory cortex at approximately 50 and 100 ms was observed during all tasks. A reduction in the peak amplitudes of the M50 and M100 components was observed during the active generation versus passive listening tasks dependent on the stimuli. Adults who stutter did not differ in the amount of speech-induced auditory suppression relative to fluent speakers. Adults who stutter had shorter M100 latencies for the actively generated speaking tasks in the right hemisphere relative to the left hemisphere but the fluent speakers showed similar latencies across hemispheres. During passive listening tasks, adults who stutter had longer M50 and M100 latencies than fluent speakers. The results suggest that there are timing, rather than amplitude, differences in auditory processing during speech in adults who stutter and are discussed in relation to hypotheses of auditory-motor integration breakdown in stuttering.

The necessity of animal models in pain research	PAIN			English	Review							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; DOUBLE-BLIND; CANCER PAIN; NEURONS; RAT; MICE; MECHANISMS	There exists currently a fair degree of introspection in the pain research community about the value of animal research. This review represents a defense of animal research in pain. We discuss the inherent advantage of animal models over human research as well as the crucial complementary roles animal studies play vis-a-vis human imaging and genetic studies. Finally, we discuss recent developments in animal models of pain that should improve the relevance and translatability of findings using laboratory animals. We believe that pain research using animal models is a continuing necessity-to understand fundamental mechanisms, identify new analgesic targets, and inform, guide and follow up human studies-if novel analgesics are to be developed for the treatment of chronic pain.

Role of peripheral endothelin receptors in an animal model of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS- I)	PAIN			English	Article						Reflex sympathetic dystrophy; Neuropathic pain; Allodynia; Ischemia-reperfusion injury; Chronic post-ischemia pain; Endothelin-1; Endothelin-2; Endothelin A receptor; Endothelin B receptor	CHRONIC POSTISCHEMIA PAIN; REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY; RAT KNEE-JOINT; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; INDUCED NOCICEPTION; ETB RECEPTORS; ARTICULAR NOCICEPTION; THERMAL HYPERALGESIA; CONSTRICTION INJURY; TACTILE ALLODYNIA	Chronic post-ischemic pain (CPIP) is an animal model of CRPS-I developed using a 3-h ischemia-reperfusion injury of the rodent hind paw. The contribution of local endothelin to nociception has been evaluated in CPIP mice by measuring sustained nociceptive behaviors (SNBs) following intraplantar injection of endothelin-1 or -2 (ET-1, ET-2). The effects of local BQ-123 (ETA-R antagonist), BQ-788 (ETB-R antagonist), IRL-1620 (ETB-R agonist) and naloxone (opioid antagonist) were assessed on ET-induced SNBs and/or mechanical and cold allodynia in CPIP mice. ETA-R and ETB-R expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Compared to shams, CPIP mice exhibited hypersensitivity to local ET-1 and ET-2. BQ-123 reduced ET-1- and ET-2-induced SNBs in both sham and CPIP animals, but not mechanical or cold allodynia. BQ-788 enhanced ET-1- and ET-2-induced SNBs in both sham and CPIP mice, and cold allodynia in CPIP mice. IRL-1620 displayed a non-opioid anti-nociceptive effect on ET-1- and ET-2-induced SNBs and mechanical allodynia in CPIP mice. The distribution of ETA-R and ETB-R was similar in plantar skin of sham and CPIP mice, but both receptors were over-expressed in plantar muscles of CPIP mice. This study shows that ETA-R and ETB-R have differing roles in nociception for sham and CPIP mice. CPIP mice exhibit more local endothelin-induced SNBs, develop a novel local ETB-R agonist-induced (non-opioid) analgesia, and exhibit over-expression of both receptors in plantar muscles, but not skin. The effectiveness of local ETB-R agonists as anti-allodynic treatments in CPIP mice holds promise for novel therapies in CRPS-I patients. (c) 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.
