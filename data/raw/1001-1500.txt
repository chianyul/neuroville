Low-Dose Lithium Stabilizes Human Endothelial Barrier by Decreasing MLC Phosphorylation and Universally Augments Cholinergic Vasorelaxation Capacity in a Direct Manner	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						bipolar disorder; blood-brain barrier; endothelial barrier; endothelial function; myosin light chain; lithium; stroke; vessel relaxation	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; CEREBRAL-ARTERY INFARCTION; GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3; BIPOLAR DISORDER; NITRIC-OXIDE; INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; STROKE; CALCIUM; RELEVANCE	Lithium at serum concentrations up to 1 mmol/L has been used in patients suffering from bipolar disorder for decades and has recently been shown to reduce the risk for ischemic stroke in these patients. The risk for stroke and thromboembolism depend not only on cerebral but also on general endothelial function and health; the entire endothelium as an organ is therefore pathophysiologically relevant. Regardless, the knowledge about the direct impact of lithium on endothelial function remains poor. We conducted an experimental study using lithium as pharmacologic pretreatment for murine, porcine and human vascular endothelium. We predominantly investigated endothelial vasorelaxation capacities in addition to human basal and dynamic (thrombin-/PAR-1 receptor agonist-impaired) barrier functioning including myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation (MLC-P). Low-dose therapeutic lithium concentrations (0.4 mmol/L) significantly augment the cholinergic endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation capacities of cerebral and thoracic arteries, independently of central and autonomic nerve system influences. Similar concentrations of lithium (0.2-0.4 mmol/L) significantly stabilized the dynamic thrombin -induced and PAR-1 receptor agonist-induced permeability of human endothelium, while even the basal permeability appeared to be stabilized. The lithium attenuated dynamic permeability was mediated by a reduced endothelial MLC-P known to be followed by a lessening of endothelial cell contraction and paracellular gap formation. The well-known lithium-associated inhibition of inositol monophosphatase/glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta signaling-pathways involving intracellular calcium concentrations in neurons seems to similarly occur in endothelial cells, too, but with different down-stream effects such as MLC-P reduction. This is the first study discovering low dose lithium as a drug directly stabilizing human endothelium and ubiquitously augmenting cholinergic endothelium-mediated vasorelaxation. Our findings have translational and potentially clinical impact on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease associated with inflammation explaining why lithium can reduce, e.g., the risk for stroke. However, further clinical studies are warranted.	[Bosche, Bert; Macdonald, R.

Their pathophysiology is often unclear, and treatment is inefficient. During the last 20 years, genetic linkage analysis and association studies have made considerable strides toward identifying key molecular contributors to the onset and maintenance of chronic pain. Here, we review the genetic variants that have been implicated in chronic pain conditions, divided into the following etiologically-grouped categories: migraine, musculoskeletal pain disorders, neuropathic pain disorders, and visceral pain disorders. In rare familial monogenic pain conditions several strong-effect mutations have been identified. In contrast, the genetic landscape of common chronic pain conditions suggests minor contributions from a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms representing different functional pathways. A comprehensive survey of up-to-date genetic association results reveals migraine and musculoskeletal pain to be the most investigated chronic pain disorders, in which nearly half of identified genetic variability alters neurotransmission pathways.

Purpose: To assess the safety and effectiveness of the posterior approach for resection of advanced Pancoast tumors. Overview of Literature: In patients with advanced Pancoast tumors invading the spine, most surgical teams consider the combined approach to be necessary for "en-bloc" resection to control visceral, vascular, and neurological structures. We report our preliminary experience with a single-stage posterior approach. Methods: We included all patients who underwent posterior en-bloc resection of advanced Pancoast tumors invading the spine in our institution between January 2014 and May 2015. All patients had locally advanced tumors without N2 nodes or distant metastases. All patients, except 1, benefited from induction treatment consisting of a combination of concomitant chemotherapy (cisplatin-VP16) and radiation. Results: Five patients were included in this study. There were 2 men and 3 women with a mean age of 55 years (range, 46-61 years). The tumor involved 2 adjacent levels in 1 patient, 3 levels in 1 patient, and 4 levels in 3 patients. There were no intraoperative complications. The mean operative time was 9 hours (range, 8-12 hours), and the mean estimated blood loss was 3.2 L (range, 1.5-7 L). No patient had a worsened neurological condition at discharge. Four complications occurred in 4 patients. Three complications required reoperation and none was lethal. The mean follow-up was 15.5 months (range, 9-24 months). Four patients harbored microscopically negative margins (R0 resection) and remained disease free. One patient harbored a microscopically positive margin (R1 resection) and exhibited local recurrence at 8 months following radiation treatment. Conclusions: The posterior approach was a valuable option that avoided the need for a second-stage operation. Induction chemoradiation is highly suitable for limiting the risk of local recurrence.

We hypothesized that neural response to social threat would relate to NLE in the frontal-limbic emotional regions. Participants (N = 685) were drawn from the Imagen database of 14-year-old community adolescents recruited in schools. They underwent functional MRI while viewing angry and neutral faces, as a probe to neural response to social threat. Lifetime NLEs were assessed using the 'distress', 'family' and 'accident' subscales from a life event dimensional questionnaire. Relationships between NLE subscale scores and neural response were investigated. Links of NLE subscales scores with anxiety or depression outcomes at the age of 16 years were also investigated. Lifetime 'distress' positively correlated with ventral-lateral orbitofrontal and temporal cortex activations during angry face processing. 'Distress' scores correlated with the probabilities of meeting criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder at the age of 16 years. Lifetime 'family' and 'accident' scores did not relate with neural response or follow-up conditions, however. Thus, different types of NLEs differentially predicted neural responses to threat during adolescence, and differentially predicted a de novo internalizing condition 2 years later. The deleterious effect of self-referential NLEs is suggested.

Here we tested the hypothesis that in utero exposure to venlafaxine, a highly prescribed SNRI, increases the incidence of fetal heart defects and alters placental and fetal heart serotonin signaling in the rat. Methods: Timed-pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were gavaged daily with venlafaxine hydrochloride (0, 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 8 to 20. On gestation day 21, fetuses were examined for external and internal malformations; placentas and fetal hearts were collected for the analysis of gene expression. Results: Venlafaxine had no effect on the number of live fetuses, fetal body weights, or external morphology in the absence of maternal toxicity. However, venlafaxine significantly increased the placental index (fetal body/placental weight ratio) and the incidence of fetal cardiac anomalies. Venlafaxine exposure decreased placental expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT/Slc6a4) at the transcript and protein levels. In contrast, venlafaxine increased SERT expression in the hearts of female, but not male, fetuses. Expression of the serotonin 2B receptor (5-HT2B/Htr2b) and of fibroblast growth factor 8 was induced in fetal hearts. Conclusion: In utero venlafaxine exposure altered the placental index and induced fetal cardiac anomalies in rats. We propose that the increased incidence of cardiac anomalies is mediated through alterations in serotonin signaling in the placenta and fetal heart. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Self-regulation and virtual reality in forensic psychiatry: An emphasis on theoretical underpinnings	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Review						Virtual reality; Forensic psychiatry; Self-regulation; Violent behaviours	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SEXUAL PREFERENCES; DYNAMICS; MODEL; SCHIZOPHRENIA; AGGRESSION; PERCEPTION; ACCURACY; PROGRAM; DEVIANT	Introduction. Forensic psychiatry is the field whose expertise is the assessment and treatment of offending behaviours, in particular when offenses are related to mental illness. An underlying question for all etiological models concerns the manner in which an individual's behaviours are organized. Specifically, it becomes crucial to understand how certain individuals come to display maladaptive behaviours in a given environment, especially when considering issues such as offenders' responsibility and their ability to change their behaviours. Virtual reality. Thanks to its ability to generate specific environments, associated with a high experimental control on generated simulations, virtual reality is gaining recognition in forensic psychiatry. Virtual reality has generated promising research data and may turn out to be a remarkable clinical tool in the near future. While research has increased, a conceptual work about its theoretical underpinnings is still lacking. However, no important benefit should be expected from the introduction of a new tool (as innovative as virtual reality) without an explicit and heuristic theoretical framework capable of clarifying its benefits in forensic psychiatry. Objectives. Our paper introduces self-regulation perspective as the most suitable theoretical framework for virtual reality in forensic psychiatry. It will be argued that virtual reality does not solely help to increase ecological validity. However, it does allow one to grant access to an improved understanding of violent offending behaviours by probing into the underlying mechanisms involved in the self-regulation of behaviours in a dynamical environment.

Social context differentially modulates activity of two interneuron populations in an avian basal ganglia nucleus	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						basal ganglia; electrophysiology; globus pallidus; songbird; striatum	FAST-SPIKING INTERNEURONS; WEAK SENSORY SIGNALS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; VOCAL PLASTICITY; ZEBRA FINCH; AREA-X; SONGBIRD; NEURONS; VARIABILITY	Basal ganglia circuits are critical for the modulation of motor performance across behavioral states. In zebra finches, a cortical-basal ganglia circuit dedicated to singing is necessary for males to adjust their song performance and transition between spontaneous singing, when they are alone ("undirected" song), and a performance state, when they sing to a female ("female-directed" song). However, we know little about the role of different basal ganglia cell types in this behavioral transition or the degree to which behavioral context modulates the activity of different neuron classes. To investigate whether interneurons in the songbird basal ganglia encode information about behavioral state, I recorded from two interneuron types, fast-spiking interneurons (FSI) and external pallidal (GPe) neurons, in the songbird basal ganglia nucleus area X during both female-directed and undirected singing. Both cell types exhibited higher firing rates, more frequent bursting, and greater trial-by-trial variability in firing when male zebra finches produced undirected songs compared with when they produced female-directed songs. However, the magnitude and direction of changes to the firing rate, bursting, and variability of spiking between when birds sat silently and when they sang undirected and female-directed song varied between FSI and GPe neurons. These data indicate that social modulation of activity important for eliciting changes in behavioral state is present in multiple cell types within area X and suggests that social interactions may adjust circuit dynamics during singing at multiple points within the circuit.

Electrosensory processing in Apteronotus albifrons: implications for general and specific neural coding strategies across wave-type weakly electric fish species	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						neural coding; tuning; envelopes; behavior	LATERAL-LINE LOBE; 2ND-ORDER STIMULUS FEATURES; SENSORY NEURONS; SPIKE TRAINS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; GYMNARCHUS-NILOTICUS; GYMNOTIFORM FISH; NATURAL STIMULI; MOVING-OBJECTS; GYMNOTOID FISH	Understanding how the brain processes sensory input to generate behavior remains an important problem in neuroscience. Towards this end, it is useful to compare results obtained across multiple species to gain understanding as to the general principles of neural coding. Here we investigated hindbrain pyramidal cell activity in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus albifrons. We found strong heterogeneities when looking at baseline activity. Additionally, ON- and OFF-type cells responded to increases and decreases of sinusoidal and noise stimuli, respectively. While both cell types displayed band-pass tuning, OFF-type cells were more broadly tuned than their ON- type counterparts. The observed heterogeneities in baseline activity as well as the greater broadband tuning of OFF-type cells were both similar to those previously reported in other weakly electric fish species, suggesting that they constitute general features of sensory processing. However, we found that peak tuning occurred at frequencies similar to 15 Hz in A. albifrons, which is much lower than values reported in the closely related species Apteronotus leptorhynchus and the more distantly related species Eigenmannia virescens. In response to stimuli with time-varying amplitude (i.e., envelope), ON- and OFF-type cells displayed similar high-pass tuning curves characteristic of fractional differentiation and possibly indicate optimized coding. These tuning curves were qualitatively similar to those of pyramidal cells in the closely related species A. leptorhynchus. In conclusion, comparison between our and previous results reveals general and species-specific neural coding strategies. We hypothesize that differences in coding strategies, when observed, result from different stimulus distributions in the natural/social environment.

Patients treated with SRS as part of Research Ethics Board-approved clinical trials underwent volumetric DCE-CT and DCE-MRI at baseline, then at 7 and 21 days after SRS. Temporal dynamic analysis was used to create 3-dimensional pharmacokinetic parameter maps for both modalities. Individual vascular input functions were selected for DCE-CT and a population function was used for DCE-MRI. Semiquantitative and pharmacokinetic DCE parameters were assessed using a modified Tofts model within each tumor at every time point for both modalities for characterization of perfusion and capillary permeability, as well as their dependency on precontrast relaxation times (TRs), T-10, and input function. Direct voxel-to-voxel Pearson analysis showed statistically significant correlations between CT and magnetic resonance which peaked at day 7 for Ktrans (R = 0.74, P <= .0001). The strongest correlation to DCE-CT measurements was found with DCE-MRI analysis using voxel-wise T-10 maps (R = 0.575, P < .001) instead of assigning a fixed T-10 value. Comparison of histogram features showed statistically significant correlations between modalities over all tumors for median K-trans (R = 0.42, P = .01), median area under the enhancement curve (iAUC(90)) (R = 0.55, P < .01), and median iAUC(90) skewness (R = 0.34, P = .03). Statistically significant, strong correlations were found for voxel-wise Ktrans, iAUC(90), and ve values between DCE-CT and DCE-MRI. For DCE-MRI, the implementation of voxel-wise T-10 maps plays a key role in ensuring the accuracy of heterogeneous pharmacokinetic maps.

Brain-injured patients are often unable to reliably self-report their pain, calling forth the need to use behavioral scales such as the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). This study aimed to test the reliability and validity of the CPOT use with brain-injured ICU adults. Materials and methods: Eight trained staff nurses and a medical student scored the CPOT before and during a nonpainful (ie, gentle touch) and at least 1 painful (eg, turning) procedure. Then, communicative patients self-reported their pain using yes/no and, when possible, on a 0 to 10 Faces Pain Thermometer. Results: A total of 79 brain-injured ICU patients participated. The intraclass correlation coefficient between trained raters was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.83) during turning. CPOT scores were significantly higher during turning compared with gentle touch (P<.001) and correlated significantly with self-reports of pain intensity during turning (0.64, P<.01). The receiver operating characteristics curve indicated a cutoff of 2 with a sensitivity of 0.90 and specificity of 0.67. Conclusions: Overall, the CPOT use was found to be reliable and valid in this patient group and is new evidence fulfilling an important gap highlighted in the Society of Critical Care Medicine practice guidelines.

We used a point process model to investigate this association using information that included tumor localization data from the INTERPHONE Study (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). Our main analysis included 792 regular mobile phone users diagnosed with a glioma between 2000 and 2004. Similar to earlier results, we found a statistically significant association between the intracranial distribution of gliomas and the self-reported location of the phone. When we accounted for the preferred side of the head not being exclusively used for all mobile phone calls, the results were similar. The association was independent of the cumulative call time and cumulative number of calls. However, our model used reported side of mobile phone use, which is potentially influenced by recall bias. The point process method provides an alternative to previously used epidemiologic research designs when one is including localization in the investigation of brain tumors and mobile phone use.

Patients and methods: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive mFOLFOX-6 alone (mFOLFOX-6) or in combination with ramucirumab 8 mg/kg IV (RAM+mFOLFOX-6) or icrucumab 15 mg/kg IV (ICR+mFOLFOX-6) every 2 weeks. Randomization was stratified by prior bevacizumab therapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), tumor response, safety, and PK. Results: In total, 158 patients were randomized, but only 153 received treatment (49 on mFOLFOX-6, 52 on RAM+mFOLFOX-6, and 52 on ICR+mFOLFOX-6). Median PFS was 18.4 weeks on mFOLFOX-6, 21.4 weeks on RAM+mFOLFOX-6, and 15.9 weeks on ICR+mFOLFOX-6 (RAM+mFOLFOX-6 versus mFOLFOX-6, stratified hazard ratio [HR] 1.116 [95% CI 0.713-1.745], P = 0.623; ICR+mFOLFOX-6 versus mFOLFOX-6, stratified HR 1.603 [95% CI 1.011-2.543], P = 0.044). Median survival was 53.6 weeks on mFOLFOX-6, 41.7 weeks on RAM+mFOLFOX-6, and 42.0 weeks on ICR+mFOLFOX-6. The most frequent adverse events reported on the ramucirumab arm (RAM+mFOLFOX-6) were fatigue, nausea, and peripheral sensory neuropathy; those on the icrucumab arm (ICR+mFOLFOX-6) were fatigue, diarrhea, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Grade >= 3 serious adverse events occurred at comparable frequency across arms. Conclusions: In this study population, combining ramucirumab or icrucumab with mFOLFOX-6 did not achieve the predetermined improvement in PFS.

This study presents the results of the development and validation of the Judgment Assessment Tool (JAT). The JAT measures two core aspects of judgment, namely generation of solutions (G) and assessment of options (A), the two first stages of decision-making process. Method. During the test development phase (study 1), a preliminary version of the JAT was evaluated by 14 experts and tested on 30 healthy controls (HC). One hundred and twenty HC (20-84 years old) and 24 participants with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) were subsequently tested on the final version of the JAT(study 2). HC participants aged 60 and over and AD participants underwent a neuropsychological evaluation. Results. The internal consistency of the final version of the JAT assessed by Cronbach's a was 0.71 for the HC group and 0.85 for the AD group. Performance on the JAT was normally distributed both in the HC and AD groups. The test correlated with abstract reasoning, verbal fluency, and working memory. Results revealed adequate test-retest reliability and excellent interrater reliability (k coefficient was 0.92 for the G section and 0.93 for the A section). Demographically adjusted normative data were generated based on a regression analysis and results showed that AD participants performed worse than HC with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 1.79). Conclusion. Overall, these results provide evidence of the reliability and strong construct validity of the JAT to evaluate judgment.

Neurons inherent to visual cortex are capable of adapting to changes in the incoming stimuli that drive the cortical plasticity. A principle feature called orientation selectivity can be altered by the presentation of non-optimal stimulus called 'adapter'. When triggered, LGN cells impinge upon layer IV and further relay the information to deeper layers via layers II-III. Using different adaptation protocols, neuronal plasticity can be investigated. Superficial neurons in area V1 are well acknowledged to exhibit attraction and repulsion by shifting their tuning peaks when challenged by a non-optimal stimulus called 'adapter'. Layers V-VI neurons in spite of partnering layers II-III neurons in cortical computation have not been explored simultaneously toward adaptation. We believe that adaptation not only affects cells specific to a layer but modifies the entire column. In this study, through simultaneous multiunit recordings in anesthetized cats using a multichannel depth electrode, we show for the first time how layers V-VI neurons (1000-1200 mu m) along with layers II-III neurons (300-500 mu m) exhibit plasticity in response to adaptation. Our results demonstrate that superficial and deeper layer neurons react synonymously toward adapter by exhibiting similar behavioral properties. The neurons displayed similar amplitude of shift and maintained equivalent sharpness of Gaussian tuning peaks before and the following adaptation. It appears that a similar mechanism, belonging to all layers, is responsible for the analog outcome of the neurons' experience with adapter.

Initial studies suggested that NRADD regulates neurotrophin signaling but very little is known about its physiological roles. We have generated and characterized NRADD conditional and germ-line null mouse lines. These mice are viable and fertile and dot show evident abnormalities. However, NRADD deletion results in an increase in the proportion of dorsal root ganglion neurons expressing p75NTR. The NRADD conditional and complete knockout mouse lines generated are new and useful tools to study the physiological roles of NRADD. Birth Defects Research (Part A) 106:605-612, 2016.

Presurgical evaluation often includes language investigation to prevent or reduce the risk of postsurgical language deficits. Current techniques involve significant limitations with pediatric populations. Recently, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been shown to be a valuable neuroimaging technique for language localization in children. However, it typically requires the child to perform a task (task-based NIRS), which may constitute a significant limitation. Resting-state functional connectivity NIRS (fcNIRS) is an approach that can be used to identify language networks at rest. This study aims to assess the utility of fcNIRS in children by comparing fcNIRS to more conventional task-based NIRS for language mapping in 33 healthy participants: 25 children (ages 3 to 16) and 8 adults. Data were acquired at rest and during a language task. Results show very good concordance between both approaches for language localization (Dice similarity coefficient = 0.81 +/- 0.13) and hemispheric language dominance (kappa = 0.86, p < 0.006). The fcNIRS technique may be a valuable tool for language mapping in clinical populations, including children and patients with cognitive and behavioral impairments. (C) The Authors.

Low-cost multimodal light sheet microscopy for optically cleared tissues and living specimens	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS			English	Article						optics; lasers; light sheet; tissue clearing; neurobiology; microscopy	PLANE ILLUMINATION MICROSCOPY; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EMBRYOS; ULTRAMICROSCOPY; RESOLUTION; NEURONS; SAMPLES; SPIM	Light sheet microscopy techniques have expanded with designs to address many new applications. Due to rapid advancements in computing power, camera/detector technologies, and tissue clearing techniques, light sheet methods are becoming increasingly popular for biomedical imaging applications at the cellular and tissue levels. Light sheet imaging modalities couple rapid imaging rates, low-levels of phototoxicity, and excellent signal to noise ratios, contributing to their popularity for experimental biology. However, the current major limitation of light sheet microscopy arises from optical aberrations, with the main drawback being the defocusing introduced by refractive index variations that accompany clearing techniques. Here, we propose an inexpensive and easy to build light sheet based instrumentation to overcome this limitation by optomechanically decoupling the sample scanning movement from the detection step. Our solution is relatively simple to implement and also provides increased modularity by using a swappable excitation arm. This expands the range of samples we can image on a single system, from high resolution for single cells at mu m spatial resolution, to tissues with mm spatial resolution. We demonstrate our approach, using the system to image iDISCO cleared embryos and sciatic nerves, and provide the full three-dimensional reconstruction of these objects in minutes. (C) The Authors.

Materials and methods: Patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC who had received one prior chemotherapy regimen were randomized (1:1 stratified by histology [adenocarcinoma/nonadenocarcinoma], prior bevacizumab, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and presence of brain metastases) to receive intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on Day 1 plus nintedanib 200 mg orally twice daily or matching placebo on Days 2-21, every 3 weeks until progression/unacceptable toxicity. Progression-free survival (PFS) by independent central review was the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS) was the key secondary endpoint. Results: Based on the pre-planned futility analysis of investigator-assessed PFS, conducted by an independent data monitoring committee, recruitment was halted on 18 June 2011 after 713 (n=353 nintedanib/pemetrexed; n =360 placebo/pemetrexed)/1300 planned patients had enrolled. There were no safety concerns. Subsequent analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS favoring nintedanib/pemetrexed over placebo/pemetrexed (median 4.4 months vs 3.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.99, p = 0.0435). There was no significant difference in OS (median 12.0 months vs 12.7 months; HR=1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.21, p = 0.8940) after 514 deaths. Nintedanib/pemetrexed resulted in a higher incidence of grade >= 3 elevated alanine aminotransferase (23.3% vs 7.3%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (12.1% vs 1.7%) and diarrhea (3.5% vs 1.1%) compared with placebo pemetrexed, but no difference in hypertension, bleeding or thrombosis. Conclusion: Although recruitment stopped prematurely, combining nintedanib with pemetrexed significantly prolonged PFS in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC after first-line chemotherapy, with a manageable safety profile.

Effects of vocal training in a musicophile with congenital amusia	NEUROCASE			English	Article						Congenital amusia; diffusion tractography; musical training	TONE-DEAFNESS; PITCH DEAFNESS; TEST SCORE; PERCEPTION; MUSIC; BRAIN; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; INDIVIDUALS; PLASTICITY; EXPERIENCE	Congenital amusia is a condition in which an individual suffers from a deficit of musical pitch perception and production. Individuals suffering from congenital amusia generally tend to abstain from musical activities. Here, we present the unique case of Tim Falconer, a self-described musicophile who also suffers from congenital amusia. We describe and assess Tim's attempts to train himself out of amusia through a self-imposed 18-month program of formal vocal training and practice. We tested Tim with respect to music perception and vocal production across seven sessions including pre- and post-training assessments. We also obtained diffusion-weighted images of his brain to assess connectivity between auditory and motor planning areas via the arcuate fasciculus (AF). Tim's behavioral and brain data were compared to that of normal and amusic controls. While Tim showed temporary gains in his singing ability, he did not reach normal levels, and these gains faded when he was not engaged in regular lessons and practice. Tim did show some sustained gains with respect to the perception of musical rhythm and meter.

J	Levitin, DJ; Grafton, ST				Levitin, Daniel J.; Grafton, Scott T.			Measuring the representational space of music with fMRI: a case study with Sting	NEUROCASE			English	Article						Music cognition; neuroimaging; case studies; MVPA; mental imagery	AUDITORY IMAGERY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; MEMORY; BRAIN; MELODIES; PERCEPTION; ABSOLUTE; SILENCE; CORTEX; MODEL	Functional brain imaging has revealed much about the neuroanatomical substrates of higher cognition, including music, language, learning, and memory. The technique lends itself to studying of groups of individuals. In contrast, the nature of expert performance is typically studied through the examination of exceptional individuals using behavioral case studies and retrospective biography. Here, we combined fMRI and the study of an individual who is a world-class expert musician and composer in order to better understand the neural underpinnings of his music perception and cognition, in particular, his mental representations for music. We used state of the art multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) and representational dissimilarity analysis (RDA) in a fixed set of brain regions to test three exploratory hypotheses with the musician Sting: (1) Composing would recruit neutral structures that are both unique and distinguishable from other creative acts, such as composing prose or visual art; (2) listening and imagining music would recruit similar neural regions, indicating that musical memory shares anatomical substrates with music listening; (3) the MVPA and RDA results would help us to map the representational space for music, revealing which musical pieces and genres are perceived to be similar in the musician's mental models for music. Our hypotheses were confirmed. The act of composing, and even of imagining elements of the composed piece separately, such as melody and rhythm, activated a similar cluster of brain regions, and were distinct from prose and visual art. Listened and imagined music showed high similarity, and in addition, notable similarity/dissimilarity patterns emerged among the various pieces used as stimuli: Muzak and Top 100/Pop songs were far from all other musical styles in Mahalanobis distance (Euclidean representational space), whereas jazz, R&B, tango and rock were comparatively close. Closer inspection revealed principaled explanations for the similarity clusters found, based on key, tempo, motif, and orchestration.

It has been postulated that this rare complication may be due to CNS ontological treatment neurotoxicity, related to intrathecal drugs, such as methotrexate, and brain radiotherapy. We report four patients who developed drug-resistant epilepsy sometime after receiving treatment for acute lymphocytic leukaemia. All patients were female and received intrathecal methotrexate. One received additional intrathecal cytarabine, and two concomitant brain radiotherapy. Two developed Lennox-Gastaut type syndrome, one multifocal epilepsy, and one focal epilepsy related to a radiotherapy-induced cavernous angioma. The development of drug resistant epilepsy after treatment for acute lymphocytic leukaemia is a rare complication that may vary, from focal epilepsy to an epileptic encephalopathy. This may appear even years after the treatment has finished and is most likely associated with treatment-related neurotoxicity.

A domain in the C-terminus of TSPO was characterized as the cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC). The ability of the CRAC domain to bind to cholesterol led us to hypothesize that this peptide may participate in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane permeability. Herein, we report the effect of the synthetic CRAC peptide, VLNYYVW, on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. It was found that the CRAC peptide alone prevents the mPTP from opening, as well as the release of apoptotic factors (cytochrome c, AIF, and EndoG) in rat brain mitochondria (RBM). Co-incubation of CRAC, together with the TSPO drug ligand, PK 11195, resulted in the acceleration of mPTP opening and in the increase of apoptotic factor release. VLNYYVW did not induce swelling in rat liver mitochondria (RLM). 3,17,19-androsten-5-triol (19-Atriol; an inhibitor of the cholesterol-binding activity of the CRAC peptide) alone and in combination with the peptide was able to stimulate RLM swelling, which was Ca2+-and CsA-sensitive. Additionally, a combination of 19-Atriol with 100 nM PK 11195 or with 100 mu M PK 11195 displayed the opposite effect: namely, the addition of 19-Atriol with 100 mu M PK 11195 in a suspension of RLM suppressed the Ca2+-induced swelling of RLM by 40%, while the presence of 100 nM PK 11195 with 19-Atriol enhanced the swelling of RLM by 60%. Taken together, these data suggest the participation of the TSPO's CRAC domain in the regulation of permeability transition.

Richard			Accelerating Translational Research through Open Science: The Neuro Experiment	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material							OPEN INNOVATION; MODELS	Translational research is often afflicted by a fundamental problem: a limited understanding of disease mechanisms prevents effective targeting of new treatments. Seeking to accelerate research advances and reimagine its role in the community, the Montreal Neurological Institute (Neuro) announced in the spring of 2016 that it is launching a five-year experiment during which it will adopt Open Science D open data, open materials, and no patenting D across the institution. The experiment seeks to examine two hypotheses. The first is whether the Neuro's Open Science initiative will attract new private partners. The second hypothesis is that the Neuro's institution-based approach will draw companies to the Montreal region, where the Neuro is based, leading to the creation of a local knowledge hub. This article explores why these hypotheses are likely to be true and describes the Neuro's approach to exploring them.	[Gold, E. Richard] McGill Univ, McGill Fac Law, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gold, E.

Strikingly, several sporting dog breeds are particularly affected by such neuropathies. Clinical signs appear in young puppies and consist of acral analgesia, with or without sudden intense licking, biting and severe self-mutilation of the feet, whereas proprioception, motor abilities and spinal reflexes remain intact. Through a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) with 24 affected and 30 unaffected sporting dogs using the Canine HD 170K SNP array (Illumina), we identified a 1.8 Mb homozygous locus on canine chromosome 4 (adj. p-val = 2.5x10(-6)). Targeted high-throughput sequencing of this locus in 4 affected and 4 unaffected dogs identified 478 variants. Only one variant perfectly segregated with the expected recessive inheritance in 300 sporting dogs of known clinical status, while it was never present in 900 unaffected dogs from 130 other breeds. This variant, located 90 kb upstream of the GDNF gene, a highly relevant neurotrophic factor candidate gene, lies in a long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA), GDNF-AS. Using human comparative genomic analysis, we observed that the canine variant maps onto an enhancer element. Quantitative RT-PCR of dorsal root ganglia RNAs of affected dogs showed a significant decrease of both GDNF mRNA and GDNF-AS expression levels (respectively 60% and 80%), as compared to unaffected dogs. We thus performed gel shift assays (EMSA) that reveal that the canine variant significantly alters the binding of regulatory elements. Altogether, these results allowed the identification in dogs of GDNF as a relevant candidate for human HSAN and insensitivity to pain, but also shed light on the regulation of GDNF transcription. Finally, such results allow proposing these sporting dog breeds as natural models for clinical trials with a double benefit for human and veterinary medicine.

Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Affects Progenitor Cell Numbers in Olfactory Bulbs and Dentate Gyrus of Vervet Monkeys	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						proliferating progenitor cells; stereology; fetal alcohol; olfactory bulb; hippocampus; non-human primate	COMPREHENSIVE MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; ADULT HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; ROSTRAL MIGRATORY STREAM; NEURAL STEM-CELL; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; ETHANOL EXPOSURE; IMAGING OUTCOMES; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; BRAIN	Fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) alters hippocampal cell numbers in rodents and primates, and this may be due, in part, to a reduction in the number or migration of neuronal progenitor cells. The olfactory bulb exhibits substantial postnatal cellular proliferation and a rapid turnover of newly formed cells in the rostral migratory pathway, while production and migration of postnatal neurons into the dentate gyrus may be more complex. The relatively small size of the olfactory bulb, compared to the hippocampus, potentially makes this structure ideal for a rapid analysis. This study used the St. Kitts vervet monkey (Chlorocebus sabeus) to (1) investigate the normal developmental sequence of post-natal proliferation in the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus and (2) determine the effects of naturalistic prenatal ethanol exposure on proliferation at three different ages (neonate, five months and two years). Using design-based stereology, we found an age-related decrease of actively proliferating cells in the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus for both control and FAE groups. Furthermore, at the neonatal time point, the FAE group had fewer actively proliferating cells as compared to the control group. These data are unique with respect to fetal ethanol effects on progenitor proliferation in the primate brain and suggest that the olfactory bulb may be a useful structure for studies of cellular proliferation.

The visual review of HFOs on intracerebral electroencephalography is time consuming and tedious, and it can be improved by time-frequency (TF) analysis. The main issue is that the signal is dominated by lower frequencies that mask the HFOs. Our aim was to flatten (i.e., whiten) the frequency spectrum to enhance the fast oscillations while preserving an optimal signal to noise ratio (SNR). Method: We investigated eight methods of data whitening based on either prewhitening or TF normalization in order to improve the detectability of HFOs. We detected all local maxima of the TF image above a range of thresholds in the HFO band. Results: We obtained the precision and recall curves at different SNR and for different HFO types and illustrate the added value of whitening both in the TF plane and in time domain. Conclusion: The normalization strategies based on a baseline and on our proposed method (the "H-0 z-score") are more precise than the others. Significance: The H-0 z-score provides an optimal framework for representing and detecting HFOs, independent of a baseline and a priori frequency bands.

J	Kiakojoori, S; Khorasani, K				Kiakojoori, S.; Khorasani, K.			Dynamic neural networks for gas turbine engine degradation prediction, health monitoring and prognosis	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Dynamic neural networks; Health monitoring prediction; Gas turbine engines; Degradation prediction; Prognosis	NONLINEAR-SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION; TIME-SERIES; PARAMETER SELECTION; MODEL SELECTION; FUZZY SYSTEMS; DIAGNOSTICS; MAINTENANCE	In this paper, the problem of health monitoring and prognosis of aircraft gas turbine engines is considered by using computationally intelligent methodologies. Two different dynamic neural networks, namely the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input neural networks and the Elman neural networks, are developed and designed for this purpose. The proposed dynamic neural networks are designed to capture the dynamics of two main degradations in the gas turbine engine, namely the compressor fouling and the turbine erosion. The health status and condition of the engine in terms of the turbine output temperature (TT) are then predicted subject to occurrence of these deteriorations. Various scenarios consisting of fouling and erosion separately as well as combined are considered. For each scenario, several neural networks are trained and their performance in predicting multiple flights ahead TTs is evaluated. Finally, the most suitable neural networks for achieving the best prediction are selected by using the normalized Bayesian information criterion model selection. Simulation results presented demonstrate and illustrate the effective performance of our proposed neural network-based prediction and prognosis strategies.

J	Valverde, R				Valverde, Raul			A Quantum Biofeedback and Neurotechnology Cybertherapy System for the Support of Transpersonal Psychotherapy	NEUROQUANTOLOGY			English	Article						altered states of consciousness; neurotechnology; biofeedback; quantum medicine; transpersonal therapy	MAGNETIC-FIELDS; ALTERED STATES; CONSCIOUSNESS; EXPERIENCES; MEDITATION; INDUCTION	Transpersonal psychology is the study of human nature and rests on the assumption that human beings possess potentials that exceed the limits of their ego and integrate the spiritual experience within a broader understanding of the human psyche and consciousness. Altered states of consciousness have been used to aid psychotherapy by transpersonalists for decades. A cyberpsychotherapy system is proposed to support transpersonal psychotherapy. The system can be used to induce a non-ordinary state of consciousness that can be used by transpersonal psychologists as a healing tool to treat patients with psychological problems such as psychosis. With the help of internet technology, these treatment sessions can occur over great distances. The cyberpsychotherapy system uses a quantum signal generator for the induction of altered states of consciousness, based on the so-called Koren Helmet of Persinger's (1983). The cyberpsychotherapy has integrated EEG which serves as a biofeedback device in order to assess if the patient has reached the desired level of consciousness. Additionally, this EEG measurement can be used to inform the adjustment of the signal generator frequency to improve the psychotherapy experience of the patient, if necessary. A sample of 10 patients was used to test the cybertherapy system based on neurotechnology and quantum biofeedback. Data was collected and analysed to confirm the system's efficacy. Although the results show that the patients were not able to reach the desired level of consciousness for the psychotherapy, there was statistically significant evidence that the proposed system can alter an individual's level of consciousness, which may help inform future designs intended to induce a state of consciousness most conducive to psychotherapy.

A recently described syndrome of isolated CH-C and macroorchidism was attributed to loss-of-function mutations of the immunoglobulin superfamily, member 1 gene (IGSF1). Patients and Methods: CH-C was diagnosed in three siblings. The TRH, TRHR, and TSHB genes were sequenced followed by whole-exome sequencing in the proband. A mutation identified in IGSF1 was analyzed by direct PCR sequencing in family members. The effects of the mutation were assessed by in vitro studies in HEK293 cells. Results: The index case was negative for mutations in TRH, TRHR, and TSHB. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel insertion mutation in IGSF1, c.2284_2285insA, p.R762QfsX7, which was confirmed by direct PCR sequencing and was identified in six additional family members. The mutation introduces a frame-shift and premature stop codon in the seventh Ig loop, thereby truncating IGSF1. In vitro studies revealed that the mutated IGSF1-R762QfsX7 migrates as a doublet at approximate to 28kDa, which is far smaller than the wild type protein (130-140kDa). Both bands were endonuclease H sensitive, indicating immature glycosylation and failure of the protein to traffic out of the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Further phenotypic findings in the family included macroorchidism and infertility in the uncle and mild neurological phenotypes in the affected males, such as hypotonia, delayed psychomotor development, clumsy behavior, and attention deficit disorder. Conclusions: We identified a novel insertion mutation in the IGSF1 gene and further delineated the phenotype of the IGSF1-deficiency syndrome. Our findings indicate a possible association between an IGSF1 mutation and neurological phenotypes.

Standardized 4-step technique of bladder neck dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy	INVESTIGATIVE AND CLINICAL UROLOGY			English	Review						Prostate neoplasms; Prostatectomy; Robot assisted radical prostatectomy; Robotics	OUTCOMES; EXPERIENCE; RARP	Bladder neck (BN) dissection is considered one of the most challenging steps during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Better understanding of the BN anatomy, coupled with a standardized approach may facilitate dissection while minimizing complications. We describe in this article the 4 anatomic spaces during standardized BN dissection, as well other technical maneuvers of managing difficult scenarios including treatment of a large median lobe or patients with previous transurethral resection of the prostate. The first step involves the proper identification of the BN followed by slow horizontal dissection of the first layer (the dorsal venous complex and perivesicle fat). The second step proceeds with reconfirming the location of the BN followed by midline dissection of the second anatomical layer (the anterior bladder muscle and mucosa) using the tip of the monopolar scissor until the catheter is identified. The deflated catheter is then grasped by the assistant to apply upward traction on the prostate from 2 directions along with downward traction on the posterior bladder wall by the tip of the suction instrument. This triangulation allows easier, and safer visual, layer by layer, dissection of the third BN layer (the posterior bladder mucosa and muscle wall). The forth step is next performed by blunt puncture of the fourth layer (the retrotrigonal fascia) aiming to enter into the previously dissected seminal vesical space. Finally, both vas deferens and seminal vesicles are pulled through the open BN and handed to the assistant for upper traction to initiate Denovillier's dissection and prostate pedicle/neurovascular bundle control.

However, the outcomes evaluated have been selected by investigators, based on feasibility, availability, cost, stability, and on what investigators consider to be important. Many of the routinely measured outcomes have major limitations: they may not correlate well with long-term difficulties, they may artificially divide continuous outcomes into dichotomous ones, and may have no clear relationship with quality of life and functioning of children and their families. Several investigations, such as routine term cerebral resonance imaging for preterm infants, have also not yet been shown to improve the outcome of children nor their families. In this article, the most common variables used in neonatology as well as some variables which are rarely measured but may be of equal importance for families are presented. The manner in which these outcomes are communicated to families will be examined, as well as recommendations to optimize communication with parents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This results in residual cancer cells remaining following surgery, leading to recurrence and death. We demonstrate that intraoperative Raman spectroscopy can detect invasive cancer cells centimeters beyond pathological T1-contrast-enhanced and T2-weighted MRI signals. This intraoperative optical guide can be used to detect invasive cancer cells and minimize post-surgical cancer burden. The detection of distant invasive cancer cells beyond MRI signal has the potential to increase the effectiveness of surgery and directly lengthen patient survival.

We assessed whether pesticide exposure was associated with impaired neurobehavioral outcomes in children aged 6-9 years. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 140 children living near banana plantations and plantain farms in the Talamanca County, Costa Rica and assessed their neurobehavioral performance. Exposure was determined by analyzing urinary metabolites of chlorpyrifos (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, TCPy), mancozeb (ethylenethiourea, ETU), and pyrethroids (3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3-PBA). Repeated urine samples were obtained for 36 children. We estimated associations of pesticide concentrations with neurobehavioral outcomes using multivariable linear and logistic regression models. Median (25th-75th percentiles) TCPy, ETU, and 3-PBA concentrations were 1.4 (.7-3.1), 1.2 (.7-3.0), and .8 (.5-1.5) mu g/L, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranged between .32 and .67. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher urinary TCPy concentrations were associated with poorer working memory in boys (n = 59) (beta per 10-fold increase in TCPy concentrations = -7.5, 95% CI: -14.4, -.7); poorer visual motor coordination (beta = -1.4, 95% CI: -2.7, -.1); increased prevalence of parent-reported cognitive problems/inattention (adjusted OR per 10-fold increase in urinary concentrations = 5.8, 95% CI: 1.6, 22.9), oppositional disorders (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 16.0), and ADHD (aOR = 6.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 28.6), and; decreased ability to discriminate colors (aOR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.6, 30.3; the higher the score the worse). Higher ETU concentrations were associated with poorer verbal learning outcomes (beta = -7.0, 95% CI: -12.7, -1.3). Higher 3-PBA concentrations were associated with poorer processing speed scores, particularly in girls (beta = -8.8, 95% CI: -16.1, -1.4). Our findings indicate that children living near banana and plantain plantations are exposed to pesticides that may affect their neurodevelopment, which for certain domains may differ between boys and girls. We recommend the implementation of measures to reduce pesticide exposure in children living nearby banana plantations. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Design: Laboratory study. Setting: University hospital. Patient(s): Semen samples from 21 healthy fertile men. Intervention(s): We measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) by flow cytometry using the probes dichlorofluorescin diacetate for intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and dihydroethidium for intracellular superoxide anion (O-2(-center dot)), sperm plasma membrane integrity by flow cytometry, caspase-3 activity using ELISA, and AKT phosphorylation status using Western blot in sperm that was cryopreserved and thawed in media either supplemented with BDNF or without BDNF supplementation (control). Main Outcome Measure(s): Sperm motility, viability, ROS levels, caspase-3 activity and AKT phosphorylation. Result(s): The percentage of motile and viable sperm cells was significantly higher in BDNF-supplemented groups as compared with the nonsupplemented (control) group. There was a significant difference in AKT phosphorylation status between BDNF-supplemented groups and the control group. Moreover, the levels of intracellular H2O2 and caspase-3 activity were significantly lower in the sperm cells that were frozen and thawed in media supplemented with BDNF compared with in the control group. Conclusion(s): BDNF supplementation to sperm freezing or thawing media has protective effects against oxidative stress and apoptosis in frozen-thawed human spermatozoa and could improve sperm function, probably through the activation of AKT.

Neonatal encephalopathy is mainly due to the compounding and interacting effects of hypoxia-ischemia and inflammation resulting from placental and other perinatal infections. It is unclear why hypothermia is effective in alleviating neonatal encephalopathy in some, but not all, full-term newborns. However, newborns exposed to inflammatory sensitized hypoxia-ischemia seem to have less therapeutic benefit from hypothermia than those exposed to hypoxia-ischemia alone. Objectives: To clarify this uncertainty, we tested the efficacy of hypothermia in a double-hit model of neonatal encephalopathy induced by inflammatory-sensitized hypoxia-ischemia. Methods: Using a rat preclinical model of endotoxin plus hypoxia-ischemia-induced neonatal encephalopathy of term newborns, we assessed the following in pups exposed (or not) to hypothermia: the extent of brain injuries and the expressions of molecules implicated in neural cell death, namely: pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase-9, antioxidant enzymes, as well as receptor interacting protein-3. Results: Hypothermia was neuroprotective on inflammatory-sensitized hypoxia-ischemia-induced penumbra, but not core, brain injuries. This beneficial effect was associated with a hypothermia induced increase of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase-1, glutathione peroxidase-1), but was not associated with any variations of the other inflammatory mediators tested, namely: interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Conclusion: Hypothermia is neuroprotective against inflammatory-sensitized hypoxia-ischemia possibly through a hypothermia-induced increase of antioxidant enzymes. This neuroprotective effect seems to be independent of the interleukin-1 system. (C) 2016 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The goal of the present study was to study brain mechanisms associated with expectations of hostile/non-hostile intent and their on-line evaluation. Scenarios with a hostile versus non-hostile social context followed by a character's ambiguous aversive behavior were presented to readers, and we recorded and analyzed event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to critical words that disambiguated the hostile versus non-hostile intent behind the behavior. Fifty nonaggressive individuals participated in the study. Non-hostile critical words that violated hostile intention expectations elicited a larger negative-going ERP deflection with central and posterior maximums between 400 and 600 ms after word onset compatible with an N400 effect. Finally, there were marginally significant correlations between N400 effect sizes and hostile as well as neutral attribution bias measured by a self-report questionnaire. The results suggest that nonaggressive individuals evaluate rapidly, on-line, their attributions of the hostile intent of others. The methodology we developed provides the field with a new paradigm with which to study social attributions of hostile intent likely to contribute to hostile or aggressive reactions.

A simulation-optimization approach, which incorporates a simulation model for groundwaterflow and transport processes within an optimization program, could help engineers in designing a remediation system that best satisfies management objectives as well as regulatory constraints. In-situ bioremediation is a highly complex, non-linear process and the modelling of such a complex system requires significant computational exertion. Soft computing techniques have a flexible mathematical structure which can generalize complex nonlinear processes. In in-situ bioremediation management, a physically-based model is used for the simulation and the simulated data is utilized by the optimization model to optimize the remediation cost. The recalling of simulator to satisfy the constraints is an extremely tedious and time consuming process and thus there is need for a simulator which can reduce the computational burden. This study presents a simulation-optimization approach to achieve an accurate and cost effective in-situ bioremediation system design for groundwater contaminated with BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) compounds. In this study, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used as a proxy simulator to replace BIOPLUME III for the simulation. The selection of ELM is done by a comparative analysis with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as they were successfully used in previous studies of in-situ bioremediation system design. Further, a single-objective optimization problem is solved by a coupled Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)-Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to achieve the minimum cost for the in situ bioremediation system design. The results indicate that ELM is a faster and more accurate proxy simulator than ANN and SVM. The total cost obtained by the ELM-PSO approach is held to a minimum while successfully satisfying all the regulatory constraints of the contaminated site. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kasparian, K; Steinhauer, K				Kasparian, Kristina; Steinhauer, Karsten			Confusing similar words: ERP correlates of lexical-semantic processing in first language attrition and late second language acquisition	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Neuroplasticity; Lexical-semantic processing; First language attrition; Second language processing; Proficiency; Age-of-acquisition	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LATE L2 LEARNERS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NATIVE-LIKE; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION; ORTHOGRAPHIC NEIGHBORHOOD; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; SENTENCE CONTEXT; CRITICAL PERIOD; RECOGNITION	First language (L1) attrition is a socio-linguistic circumstance where second language (L2) learning coincides with changes in exposure and use of the native-L1 Attriters often report experiencing a decline in automaticity or proficiency in their Ll after a prolonged period in the L2 environment, while their L2 proficiency continues to strengthen. Investigating the neurocognitive correlates of attrition alongside those of late L2 acquisition addresses the question of whether the brain mechanisms underlying both L1 and L2 processing are strongly determined by proficiency, irrespective of whether the language was acquired from birth or in adulthood. Using event-related-potentials (ERPs), we examined lexical-semantic processing in Italian Ll attriters, compared to adult Italian L2 learners and to Italian monolingual native speakers. We contrasted the processing of classical lexical-semantic violations (Mismatch condition) with sentences that were equally semantically implausible but arguably trickier, as the target-noun was "swapped" with an orthographic neighbor that differed only in its final vowel and gender-marking morpheme (e.g., cappello (hat) vs. cappella (chapel)). Our aim was to determine whether sentences with such "confusable nouns" (Swap condition) would be processed as semantically correct by late L2 learners and Ll attriters, especially for those individuals with lower Italian proficiency scores. We found that lower-proficiency Italian speakers did not show significant N400 effects for Swap violations relative to correct sentences, regardless of whether Italian was the L1 or the L2. Crucially, N400 response profiles followed a continuum of "nativelikeness" predicted by Italian proficiency scores high-proficiency attriters and high-proficiency Italian learners were indistinguishable from native controls, whereas attriters and L2 learners in the lower-proficiency range showed significantly reduced N400 effects for "Swap" errors. Importantly, attriters and late L2 learners did not differ in their N400 responses when they belonged to the same proficiency subgroup. Attriters also showed an enhanced P600 response to both kinds of lexical-semantic anomalies, which we discuss as reflecting increased conflict-monitoring and conscious "second thought" processes specifically in attriters. Our findings provide some of the first ERP evidence of attrition effects, and are compatible with accounts of ongoing neuroplasticity for language in adulthood. Proficiency, rather than age-of-acquisition, seems to be the key factor in modulating certain neurocognitive responses, not only within L2 learners but also in L1 attriters.

These factors can be easily identifiable such as drugs, chronic diseases or prenatal maternal stress. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the serotonin synthetized by the placenta was crucial for fetal brain development. Moreover, many studies show the involvement of serotonin system alteration in psychiatric disease during childhood and adulthood. This review summarizes existing studies showing that prenatal maternal stress, which induces alteration of serotonin systems (placenta and fetal brain) during a critical window of early development, could lead to alteration of fetal development and increase risks of psychiatric diseases later in life. This phenomenon, termed fetal programming, could be moderated by the sex of the fetus. This review highlights the need to better understand the modification of the maternal, placental and fetal serotonin systems induced by prenatal maternal stress in order to find early biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.

Normal aging also modifies how emotions are processed and experienced, with increasing evidence that older adults (OAs) focus more on positive information than younger adults (YAs). The aim of the present study was to investigate how age-related changes in emotion processing influence explicit and implicit memory. We used emotional melodies that differed in terms of valence (positive or negative) and arousal (high or low). Implicit memory was assessed with a preference task exploiting exposure effects, and explicit memory with a recognition task. Results indicated that effects of valence and arousal interacted to modulate both implicit and explicit memory in YAs. In OAs, recognition was poorer than in YAs; however, recognition of positive and high-arousal (happy) studied melodies was comparable. Insofar as socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) predicts a preservation of the recognition of positive information, our findings are not fully consistent with the extension of this theory to positive melodies since recognition of low-arousal (peaceful) studied melodies was poorer in OAs. In the preference task, YAs showed stronger exposure effects than OAs, suggesting an age-related decline of implicit memory. This impairment is smaller than the one observed for explicit memory (recognition), extending to the musical domain the dissociation between explicit memory decline and implicit memory relative preservation in aging. Finally, the disproportionate preference for positive material seen in OAs did not translate into stronger exposure effects for positive material suggesting no age-related emotional bias in implicit memory.

However, experimental demonstrations of detrimental effects on non-human host behaviour are currently limited. In this study, we experimentally tested whether injections of an anti-malaria drug affected short-term behavioural responses to a problem-solving task during breeding in a wild population of great tits (Parus major) naturally infected with malaria. Adult females treated against malaria were more active than control females, even though they were not more likely to solve the task or learn how to do so, suggesting that energetic constraints could shape differences in some behaviours while changes in cognitive performances might require more time for the neural system to recover or may depend mainly on infection at the developmental stage. Alternatively, parasite load might be a consequence, rather than a cause, of inter individual variation in cognitive performance. These results also suggest that inter-individual as well as inter-population differences in some behavioural traits may be linked to blood parasite load. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although electro-encephalographic (EEG) methods have proven invaluable for understanding psycho-affective pathologies in various clinical conditions, they have not been used to understand the psycho-affective outcomes of concussive injuries. Accordingly, we evaluated the relation of electroencephalographic (EEG) power in collegiate athletes to psycho-affective measures. We predicted that athletes with a history of concussion would exhibit alterations in frontal EEG asymmetries indicative of increased depression, anxiety and more general mood disturbance. During this cross-sectional study, resting EEG and measures of mood and affect, including the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Profile of Mood States (POMS) were collected in 81 young-adult male athletes (52 concussion history; 29 controls). All athletes with a history of concussion (9+ months from injury) reported to be symptom free, and all participants were actively taking part in their sport at the time of testing. Compared to control athletes, the athletes with a history of concussion exhibited alterations in frontal-alpha and frontal-beta asymmetry (p's < .05). Correlational analyses revealed that alterations in frontal-alpha asymmetry were related to self-reported depression and anxiety, and alterations in beta-asymmetry were related to self-reported anger/aggression, but these relations were only significant for athletes with a history of concussion. The current study suggests that athletes with a history of concussion who made a complete return to play and reported to be asymptomatic on a commonly used symptom checklist may still exhibit neural activity associated with increased levels of depression, anxiety and anger/hostility. The current results reinforce the clinical necessity for long-term evaluations of athletes irrespective of apparent symptom resolution, and suggest that EEG may serve as a sensitive tool to identify and track concussion-related alterations in psycho-affective health before they manifest as clinical disorders.

One such region is called the subventricular zone (SVZ), which gives rise to new neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB). Neurons that are born postnatally migrate through more complex territories and integrate into fully functional circuits. Therefore, differences in the differentiation of embryonic and postnatally born neurons may exist. Dendritogenesis is an important process for the proper formation of future neuronal circuits. Dendritogenesis in embryonic neurons cultured in vitro was shown to depend on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Still unknown, however, is whether mTOR could regulate the dendritic arbor morphology of SVZ-derived postnatal OB neurons under physiological conditions in vivo. The present study used in vitro cultured and differentiated SVZ-derived neural progenitors and found that both mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2 were required for the dendritogenesis of SVZ-derived neurons. Furthermore, using a combination of in vivo electroporation of neural stem cells in the SVZ and genetic and pharmacological inhibition of mTOR, it was found that mTOR was crucial for the growth of basal and apical dendrites in postnatally born OB neurons under physiological conditions and contributed to the stabilization of their basal dendrites.

GBM is among the most aggressive tumors among gliomas. Temozolomide (TMZ) therapy combined with surgical or radiation approaches is the standard treatment but not effective in long term. In this study we tested the treatment with acetazolamide (ATZ), an inhibitor of CA IX, alone or combined with TMZ. The experiments were performed in 2D and 3D cultures (spheroids) using glioblastoma U251N and human brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs). Several proteins implicated in tumor cell death were also investigated. The key results from these studies suggest the following: (1) Cell death of human glioblastoma spheroids and BTSC is significantly increased with combined treatment after 7 days, and (2) the effectiveness of ATZ is significantly enhanced against BTSC and U251N when incorporated into nano-carriers. Collectively, these results point toward the usefulness of nano-delivery of CA IX inhibitors and their combination with chemotherapeutics for glioblastoma treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Pediat Emergency Res Canada	Association of Persistent Postconcussion Symptoms With Pediatric Quality of Life	JAMA PEDIATRICS			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ACUTE CONCUSSION; RISK-FACTORS; 1ST YEAR; CHILDREN; MILD; ADOLESCENTS; MODERATE; INVENTORY; VALIDITY	IMPORTANCE Persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS) pose long-term challenges and can negatively affect patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To date, no large comprehensive study has addressed the association between PPCS and HRQoL. OBJECTIVES To determine the association between HRQoL and PPCS at 4 weeks after concussion and assess the degree of impairment of HRQoL in the subsequent 12 weeks. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a prospective, multicenter cohort study (Predicting Persistent Postconcussive Problems in Pediatrics [5P]) from August 14, 2013, to September 30, 2014, children aged 5 to 18 years who presented to the emergency department within 48 hours after head injury and were considered to have an acute concussion were enrolled across 9 pediatric emergency departments within the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada Network. Persistent postconcussion symptoms were defined as 3 or more persistent symptoms on the validated Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory at 4 weeks. Linear mixed effects random coefficients models evaluated the association between PPCS and HRQoL, adjusting for potential confounders including age, sex, prior concussions, migraine, anxiety, learning disability, depression, and sleep disorder. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas HRQoL assessed with the validated Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4.0 (PedsQL-4.0) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after head injury. RESULTS Of 2006 children enrolled (median age, 11.8 years [interquartile range, 8.9-14.6 years]; 1241 boys and 765 girls), 1667 (83.1%) completed the PedsQL-4.0 at all 3 time points. Of these 1667 children, the 510 with PPCS (30.6%) had lower total PedsQL-4.0 scores (mean, 70.0) than did those without PPCS (mean, 80.3; mean difference, -10.3; 95% CI, -9.4 to -11.2). Patients with PPCS also had significantly lower physical, emotional, social, and school PedsQL-4.0 subscores at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Patients with PPCS had lower HRQoL than published healthy norms at 4 weeks (mean difference, 13.89; 95% CI, 11.55-16.23), 8 weeks (mean difference, 11.63; 95% CI, 9.34-13.93), and 12 weeks (mean difference, 9.38; 95% CI, 7.01-11.75; P<.001). Patients who recovered from concussion also had lower HRQoL than norms at 4 weeks (mean difference, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.28-5.85) and 8 weeks (mean difference, 2.75; 95% CI, 0.48-5.02; P<.05). School functioning PedsQL-4.0 subscores were significantly lower for all children regardless of PPCS status at all time points. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children with PPCS have lower HRQoL compared with those who have recovered from concussion, yet deficits in HRQoL are pervasive across all domains and may persist for months even in children whose symptoms have resolved. Future interventional research should target the effect of concussion on HRQoL.

Methods: Consecutive adult patients who underwent CEAs between January 2010 and September 2011 at a single university-affiliated center (Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite Montreal-Hotel-Dieu Hospital, Montreal) were identified from a clinical database and operative records. Covariates of interest were extracted from electronic medical records. Timing and nature of the first cerebrovascular symptoms were also documented. The first medical contact and pathway of referral were also assessed. When possible, the ABCD2 score (age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms, and diabetes) was calculated to calculate further risk of stroke. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used to assess differences in time intervals between two variables. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess differences in time intervals in comparing more than two variables. A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed using covariates that were determined to be statistically significant in our sensitivity analyses. Results: The cohort consisted of 111 patients with documented symptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing surgical intervention. Thirty-nine percent of all patients were operated on within 2 weeks from the first cerebrovascular symptoms. The median time between the occurrence of the first neurologic symptom and the CEA procedure was 25 (interquartile range [IQR], 11-85) days. The patient-dependent delay, defined as the median delay between the first neurologic symptom and the first medical contact, was 1 (IQR, 0-14) day. The medical-dependent delay was defined as the time interval between the first medical contact and CEA. This included the delay between the first medical contact and the request for surgery consultation (median, 3 [IQR, 1-10] days). The multivariate regression model demonstrated that the emergency physician as referral source (P =.0002) was statistically significant for reducing CEA delay. Patients who were investigated as an outpatient (P =.02), first medical contact with a general practitioner (P =.0002), and hospital center I as referral center (P =.045) were also found to be statistically significant to extend CEA delay when the model was adjusted over all covariates. In this center, there was no correlation between ABCD2 risk score and waiting time for surgery. Conclusions: The majority of our cohort falls short of the recommended 2-week interval to perform CEA. Factors contributing to reduced CEA delay were presentation to an emergency department, in-patient investigations, and a stroke center where a vascular surgeon is available.

This metabolic neuropsychiatric syndrome involves a spectrum of symptoms, including cognition impairment, attention deficits and motor dysfunction which eventually can progress to coma and death. Pathologically, HE is characterized by swelling of the astrocytes which consequently leads to brain edema, a common feature found in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) as well as in cirrhotic patients suffering from HE. The pathogenic factors involved in the onset of astrocyte swelling and brain edema in HE are unresolved. However, the role of astrocyte swelling/brain edema in the development of HE remains ambiguous and therefore measuring brain edema as an endpoint to evaluate HE is questioned. The following review will determine the effect of astrocyte swelling and brain edema on neurological function, discuss the various possible techniques to measure brain edema and lastly to propose a number of neurobehavioral tests to evaluate HE.

Numerous studies dictate that ammonia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HE, and hyperammonemia can lead to alterations in amino acid homeostasis. Glutamine and glycine are both ammoniagenic amino acids that are increased in liver failure. Modulating the levels of glutamine and glycine has shown to reduce ammonia concentration in hyperammonemia. Ornithine Phenylacetate (OP) has consistently been shown to reduce arterial ammonia levels in liver failure by modulating glutamine levels. In addition to this, OP has also been found to modulate glycine concentration providing an additional ammonia removing effect. Data support that glycine also serves an important role in N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediated neurotransmission in HE. This potential important role for glycine in the pathogenesis of HE merits further investigations.

The concept of "the inflamed brain" in acute liver failure: mechanisms and new therapeutic opportunities	METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE			English	Article						Neuroinflammation; Encephalopathy; Acute liver failure; Ammonia; Proinflammatory cytokines; Microglia; Minocycline	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; EDEMA; ENCEPHALOPATHY; AMMONIA; PATHOGENESIS; RATS; INFLAMMATION; HYPOTHERMIA	The presence and severity of a systemic inflammatory response is a major predictor of brain edema and encephalopathy in acute liver failure (ALF) and polymorphisms of the gene coding for the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha are known to influence the clinical outcome in ALF. Recent reports provide robust evidence for a role of neuroinflammation(inflammation of the brain per se) in ALF with the cardinal features of neuroinflammation including activation of microglial cells and increased production in situ of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and interleukins IL-1beta and IL-6. Multiple liver-brain signalling pathways have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of neuroinflammation in liver failure and these include direct effects of systemically-derived cytokines, recruitment of monocytes relating to microglial activation as well as effects of liver failure-derived toxins and altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Synergistic mechanisms involving ammonia and cytokines have been proposed. Currently-available strategies aimed at lowering of blood ammonia such as lactulose, probiotics and rifaximin have the potential to dampen systemic inflammation as does the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine, mild hypothermia and albumin dialysis. Experimental studies demonstrate that deletion of genes coding for TNF-alpha or IL-1 leads to attenuation of the CNS consequences of ALF and administration of the TNF-alpha receptor antagonist etanercept has comparable beneficial effects in experimental ALF. Together, these findings confirm a major role for central neuroinflammatory mechanisms in general and mechanisms involving TNF-alpha in particular in the pathogenesis of the cerebral consequences of ALF and open the door to novel therapeutic interventions in this often fatal disorder.

Patients received sunitinib 37.5 mg (n = 86) or placebo (n = 85) on a continuous daily-dosing schedule until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events (AEs), or death. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 at baseline, Day 1 of every 4-week cycle, and end of treatment or withdrawal. Changes >= 10 points on each scale or item were deemed clinically meaningful. Sunitinib had anti-tumor effects and improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo. The study was terminated early for this reason and because of more serious AEs and deaths with placebo. Baseline HRQoL scores were well balanced between study arms, and were generally maintained over time in both groups. In the first 10 cycles, there were no significant differences between groups in global HRQoL, cognitive, emotional, physical, role, and social functioning domains, or symptom scales, except for worsening diarrhea with sunitinib (p < 0.0001 vs. placebo). Insomnia also worsened with sunitinib (p = 0.0372 vs. placebo), but the difference was not clinically meaningful. With the exception of diarrhea (a recognized side effect), sunitinib had no impact on global HRQoL, functional domains, or symptom scales during the progression-free period. Hence, in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, sunitinib provided a benefit in PFS without adversely affecting HRQoL.

Although results showed no positive association between cellular telephone use and glioma risk overall, no increased risk for long-term users, and no exposure-response relationship, there was an elevated risk for those in the highest decile of cumulative call time. However, results may be biased as data were collected during a period of rapidly increasing cellular telephone use, and as controls were usually interviewed later in time than cases. Methods: Further analyses were conducted in a subset of five INTERPHONE study countries (Australia, Canada, France, Israel, New Zealand) using a post hoc matching strategy to optimize proximity of case-to control interview dates and age. Results: Although results were generally similar to the original INTERPHONE study, there was some attenuation of the reduced odds ratios and stronger positive associations among long-term users and those in the highest categories for cumulative call time and number of calls (eighth-ninth and 10th decile). Conclusions: Proximity and symmetry in timing of case-to-control interviews should be optimized when exposure patterns are changing rapidly with time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A retrospective review of patients with severe TBI admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was conducted. Inclusion criteria were ICP monitoring and administration of a hyperosmolar agent (20 % mannitol or 3 % hypertonic saline) within 48 h of PICU admission; for which dose and timing were recorded. For the first two boluses received for increased ICP (> 20 mmHg), the impact on ICP and CPP was assessed during the following 4 h, using repeated measures ANOVA. Co-interventions to control ICP (additional hyperosmolar agent, propofol, or barbiturate bolus) and serum sodium were also documented. A tertiary care pediatric hospital center. Children aged 1 month to 18 years, with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Score 8) and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor. Sixty-four patients were eligible, of which 16 met inclusion criteria. Average age was 11 years (SD +/- 4) and median Glasgow Coma Score was 6 (range 4-7). Seventy percent of boluses were 3 % hypertonic saline, with no identified baseline difference associated with this initial choice. Both mannitol and hypertonic saline were followed by a non-significant decrease in ICP (mannitol, p = 0.055 and hypertonic saline, p = 0.096). There was no significant change in CPP post bolus. A co-intervention occurred in 69 % of patients within the 4 h post hyperosmolar agent, and eight patients received continuous 3 % saline. In pediatric TBI with intracranial hypertension, mannitol and 3 % hypertonic saline are commonly used, but dose and therapeutic threshold for use vary without clear indications for one versus another. Controlled trials are warranted, but several barriers were identified, including high exclusion rate, multiple co-interventions, and care variability.

R.			3-T intraoperative MRI (iMRI) for pediatric epilepsy surgery	CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM			English	Article						Epilepsy; Intraoperative MRI; Outcomes; Complications; Imaging	FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; RESECTION; CHILDREN; NEURONAVIGATION; OUTCOMES; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; IMPACT; TUMORS; EEG	Three-tesla intraoperative MRI (iMRI) is a promising tool that could help confirm complete resections and disconnections in pediatric epilepsy surgery, leading to improved outcomes. However, a large proportion of epileptogenic pathologies in children are poorly defined on imaging, which brings into question the utility of iMRI for these cases. Our aim was to compare postoperative seizure outcomes between iMRI- and non-iMRI-based epilepsy surgeries. We performed a comparative retrospective analysis of non-iMRI- versus iMRI-based epilepsy surgeries with 2-year follow-up. Patients were stratified into well-defined cases (WDCs), poorly defined cases (PDCs), and diffuse hemispheric cases (DHCs). Primary outcomes were rates of complete seizure freedom and surgical complications. Secondary outcomes included good (Engel class I/II) seizure outcome, extent of resection/disconnection, and operative duration. Regression models were used to adjust for confounding. Thirty-nine iMRI-based and 39 non-iMRI-based surgeries were included. The distributions of age, sex, and lesion class in each era were similar, but the distributions of individual pathologies varied. Seizure freedom and complication rates at 2-year follow-up were not different between the groups, but Engel class I/II outcome was more common in the iMRI group. Extent of resection/disconnection and length of surgery were similar in both groups. PDCs had the worst outcomes, which were unchanged by the use of iMRI. Three-tesla iMRI-based epilepsy surgery may have the potential to improve patient outcomes. However, we conclude that iMRI, in its current state of use at our institute, does not improve outcomes for children undergoing epilepsy surgery. Given that its use appears safe, further research on this technology is warranted, particularly for the most challenging PDCs.

Methods: We calculated mean and standard deviation of wavelet entropy in 303 non-epileptic and 334 epileptic channels from 50 patients with intracerebral depth electrodes and used these measures as predictors in a multivariable logistic regression model. We assessed sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) based on a probability threshold corresponding to 90% specificity. Results: The probability of a channel being epileptic increased with higher mean (p = 0.004) and particularly with higher standard deviation (p < 0.0001). The performance of the model was however not sufficient for fully classifying the channels. With a threshold corresponding to 90% specificity, sensitivity was 37%, PPV was 80%, and NPV was 56%. Conclusions: A channel with a high standard deviation of entropy is likely to be epileptic; with a threshold corresponding to 90% specificity our model can reliably select a subset of epileptic channels. Significance: Most studies have concentrated on brief ripple events. We showed that background activity in the ripple band also has some ability to discriminate epileptic channels.

Little is known about the incidental finding of early-stage PDAC. The aim of the current study was to determine the etiology of small solid pancreatic lesions (<= 15 mm) to optimize clinical management. Methods: Inclusion criterion for the retrospective study analysis was the incidental finding of primarily undetermined small solid pancreatic lesions <= 15 mm in 394 asymptomatic patients. Final diagnoses were based on histology or cytology obtained by imaging-guided biopsy (and at least 12-month follow-up) and/or surgery. Contrast-enhanced US or contrast-enhanced EUS was performed in 219 patients. Results: The final diagnoses of 394 patients were as follows: 146 PDACs, 156 neuroendocrine tumors, 28 metastases into the pancreas from other primary sites, and 64 various other etiologies. Contrast-enhanced US allowed differential diagnosis of PDAC and non-PDAC in 189 of 219 patients (86%). Conclusions: Approximately 40% of patients with small solid pancreatic lesions had very early stage PDAC. Approximately 60% of small solid pancreatic lesions <= 15 mm are not PDAC and, therefore, do not require radical surgery. Without preoperative diagnosis, an unacceptably large proportion of patients would be exposed to radical surgery with significant morbidity and mortality.

Attention has mainly focused on the adverse auditory effects of solvents. However, other chemicals such as heavy metals have been also identified as ototoxic agents. The aim of this work was to review the current scientific knowledge about the adverse auditory effects of heavy metal exposure with and without co-exposure to noise in humans. PubMed and Medline were accessed to find suitable articles. A total of 49 articles met the inclusion criteria. Results from the review showed that no evidence about the ototoxic effects in humans of manganese is available. Contradictory results have been found for arsenic, lead and mercury as well as for the possible interaction between heavy metals and noise. All studies found in this review have found that exposure to cadmium and mixtures of heavy metals induce auditory dysfunction. Most of the studies investigating the adverse auditory effects of heavy metals in humans have investigated human populations exposed to lead. Some of these studies suggest peripheral and central auditory dysfunction induced by lead exposure. It is concluded that further evidence from human studies about the adverse auditory effects of heavy metal exposure is still required. Despite this issue, audiologists and other hearing health care professionals should be aware of the possible auditory effects of heavy metals.

MCE deficiency has previously been described in six patients, one presenting with metabolic acidosis, the others with nonspecific neurological symptoms or asymptomatic. The clinical significance and biochemical characteristics of this rare condition have been incompletely defined. We now describe a patient who presented acutely at 5 years of age with vomiting, dehydration, confusion, severe metabolic acidosis and mild hyperammonemia. At presentation, organic acid profiles were dominated by increased ketones and 3-hydroxypropionate, with moderately elevated methylcitrate and propionylglycine, and acylcarnitine profiles showed marked C3 (propionylcarnitine) elevation with normal C4DC (methylmalonylcarnitine + succinylcarnitine). Propionic acidemia was initially suspected, but it was subsequently noted that methylmalonic acid was mildly but persistently elevated in urine, and clearly elevated in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The overall biochemical profile prompted consideration of MCE deficiency. Studies on cultured fibroblasts showed moderately decreased propionate incorporation. Complementation analysis permitted assignment to the MCEE group. A heterozygous p.Arg47Ter (p.R47*) mutation in the MCEE gene was identified by sequencing of exons, and RNA studies identified a novel intronic splicing mutation, c.379-644A > G, confirming the diagnosis of MCE deficiency. Following the initial severe presentation, development has been normal and the clinical course over the subsequent six years has remained relatively uneventful on an essentially normal diet. This report contributes to the clinical and biochemical characterisation of this rare disorder, while highlighting potential causes of under-diagnosis or of diagnostic confusion.

However, the specific brain mechanisms underlying the effects of acute cardiovascular exercise on procedural memory are poorly understood. We sought to determine if a single bout of exercise modifies corticospinal excitability (CSE) during the early stages of memory consolidation. In addition, we investigated if changes in CSE are associated with exercise-induced off-line gains in procedural memory. Participants practiced a serial reaction time task followed by either a short bout of acute exercise or a similar rest period. To monitor changes in CSE we used transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) at baseline, 15, 35, 65 and 125 min after exercise or rest. Participants in the exercise condition showed larger (similar to 24%) improvements in procedural memory through consolidation although differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. Exercise promoted an increase in CSE, which remained elevated 2 h after exercise. More importantly, global increases in CSE following exercise correlated with the magnitude of off-line gains in skill level assessed in a retention test performed 8 h after motor practice. A single bout of exercise modulates short-term neuroplasticity mechanisms subserving consolidation processes that predict off-line gains in procedural memory. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Circadian time-place (or time-route) learning in rats with hippocampal lesions	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						Time-place learning; Hippocampus; Circadian rhythm; Spatial navigation	CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; DORSAL STRIATUM; MEMORY-SYSTEMS; SPATIAL MEMORY; WATER MAZE; MICE; EXPRESSION; PHASE; DISCRIMINATION; DISSOCIATION	Circadian time-place learning (TPL) is the ability to remember both the place and biological time of day that a significant event occurred (e.g., food availability). This ability requires that a circadian clock provide phase information (a time tag) to cognitive systems involved in linking representations of an event with spatial reference memory. To date, it is unclear which neuronal substrates are critical in this process, but one candidate structure is the hippocampus (HPC). The HPC is essential for normal performance on tasks that require allocentric spatial memory and exhibits circadian rhythms of gene expression that are sensitive to meal timing. Using a novel TPL training procedure and enriched, multidimensional environment, we trained rats to locate a food reward that varied between two locations relative to time of day. After rats acquired the task, they received either HPC or SHAM lesions and were re-tested. Rats with HPC lesions were initially impaired on the task relative to SHAM rats, but re-attained high scores with continued testing. Probe tests revealed that the rats were not using an alternation strategy or relying on light-dark transitions to locate the food reward. We hypothesize that transient disruption and recovery reflect a switch from HPC-dependent allocentric navigation (learning places) to dorsal striatum-dependent egocentric spatial navigation (learning routes to a location). Whatever the navigation strategy, these results demonstrate that the HPC is not required for rats to find food in different locations using circadian phase as a discriminative cue.

A potential mechanism to establish accurate temporal coordination among these paths is through the synchronization of neuronal activity to a common rhythm of neuronal firing. Previous EEG studies have suggested that theta oscillatory activity might be crucial in the integration of information from motivational and attentional paths that converge into the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) during reward-guided learning. However, due to the low spatial resolution of EEG, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Here, by combining EEG and fMRI, we show that theta oscillations serve as common substrate for the engagement of separated sub-regions within the mPFC (the pre-Supplementary Motor Area and the dorsomedial Prefrontal Cortex), underlying different cognitive operations (encoding of outcome valence and unsigned prediction errors) through separate functional paths (the Salience and the Central Executive Networks).

Complex patterns of spatially extended generators of epileptic activity: Comparison of source localization methods cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC on high resolution EEG and MEG data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG/MEG source localization; Interictal epileptic discharges; Neural mass model; Maximum entropy on the mean; 4-ExSo-MUSIC; Higher order statistics	NONINVASIVE DENSE-ARRAY; INTERICTAL SPIKES; INVERSE PROBLEM; CORTICAL SOURCES; MODEL; BRAIN; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ELECTRODES; CONDUCTIVITY; SIGNALS	Electric Source Imaging (ESI) and Magnetic Source Imaging (MSI) of EEG and MEG signals are widely used to determine the origin of interictal epileptic discharges during the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy. Epileptic discharges are detectable on EEG/MEG scalp recordings only when associated with a spatially extended cortical generator of several square centimeters, therefore it is essential to assess the ability of source localization methods to recover such spatial extent. In this study we evaluated two source localization methods that have been developed for localizing spatially extended sources using EEG/MEG data: coherent Maximum Entropy on the Mean (cMEM) and 4th order Extended Source Multiple Signal Classification (4-ExSo-MUSIC). In order to propose a fair comparison of the performances of the two methods in MEG versus EEG, this study considered realistic simulations of simultaneous EEG/MEG acquisitions taking into account an equivalent number of channels in EEG (257 electrodes) and MEG (275 sensors), involving a biophysical computational neural mass model of neuronal discharges and realistically shaped head models. cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC were evaluated for their sensitivity to localize complex patterns of epileptic discharges which includes (a) different locations and spatial extents of multiple synchronous sources, and (b) propagation patterns exhibited by epileptic discharges. Performance of the source localization methods was assessed using a detection accuracy index (Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve, AUC) and a Spatial Dispersion (SD) metric. Finally, we also presented two examples illustrating the performance of cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC on clinical data recorded using high resolution EEG and MEG. When simulating single sources at different locations, both 4-ExSo-MUSIC and cMEM exhibited excellent performance (median AUC significantly larger than 0.8 for EEG and MEG), whereas, only for EEG, 4-ExSo-MUSIC showed significantly larger AUC values than cMEM. On the other hand, cMEM showed significantly lower SD values than 4-ExSo-MUSIC for both EEG and MEG. When assessing the impact of the source spatial extent, both methods provided consistent and reliable detection accuracy for a wide range of source spatial extents (source sizes ranging from 3 to 20 cm(2) for MEG and 3 to 30 cm2 for EEG). For both EEG and MEG, 4-ExSo-MUSIC localized single source of large signal-to-noise ratio better than cMEM. In the presence of two synchronous sources, cMEM was able to distinguish well the two sources (their location and spatial extent), while 4-ExSo-MUSIC only retrieved one of them. cMEM was able to detect the spatio-temporal propagation patterns of two synchronous activities while 4-ExSo-MUSIC favored the strongest source activity. Overall, in the context of localizing sources of epileptic discharges from EEG and MEG data, 4-ExSo-MUSIC and cMEM were found accurately sensitive to the location and spatial extent of the sources, with some complementarities. Therefore, they are both eligible for application on clinical data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Chowdhury, R.

Environmental exposure to airborne Mn is associated with neurocognitive deficits in humans. Children, whose nervous system is in development, are particularly susceptible to Mn neurotoxicity. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the association between Mn environmental exposure, and effects on visuoperception and visual memory in schoolchildren. Methods: We assessed schoolchildren between 7 and 11 years old, with similar socioeconomic status, from the mining district of Molango (n = 148) and Agua Blanca (n = 119, non-mining area) in Hidalgo state, Mexico. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test was used to assess visuoperception and short-term visual memory. Hair manganese (MnH) concentrations were determined. Linear regression models were constructed to estimate the associations between MnH and ROCF scores, adjusted for potential confounders. Results: The geometric mean MnH was nine times higher in schoolchildren from the Mn mining area (5.25 mu g/g) than in schoolchildren from the non-mining area (0.55 mu g/g). For the ROCF Copy trial, MnH was significantly associated with an increase in distortion errors (tangency, closure), angle errors, overtracing (partial overtracing). In the Immediate Recall trial, MnH was significantly associated with increased overtracing (partial overtracing) and omissions, and negatively associated with the number of perceptual drawn units, total score and percentage immediate recall. Conclusions: MnH is associated with alterations in visuoperception and short-term visual memory in schoolchildren exposed to airborne Mn. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Epileptic Encephalopathy Caused by Mutations in the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor DENND5A	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; DEFICIENCY CAUSES; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PROTEIN; DOMAIN; GOLGI; CELLS; GENE; SUBUNIT; DEATH	Epileptic encephalopathies are a catastrophic group of epilepsies characterized by refractory seizures and cognitive arrest, often resulting from abnormal brain development. Here, we have identified an epileptic encephalopathy additionally featuring cerebral calcifications and coarse facial features caused by recessive loss-of-functionmutations in DENND5A. DENND5A contains a DENN domain, an evolutionarily ancient enzymatic module conferring guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity to multiple proteins serving as GEFs for Rabs, which are key regulators of membrane trafficking. DENND5A is detected predominantly in neuronal tissues, and its highest levels occur during development. Knockdown of DENND5A leads to striking alterations inneuronal development. Mechanistically, these changes appear to result from upregulation of neurotrophin receptors, leading to enhanced downstream signaling. Thus, we have identified a link between a DENN domain protein and neuronal development, dysfunction of which is responsible for a form of epileptic encephalopathy.

A large body of features exists in the literature, but no method has yet been proposed to identify the most promising of these, other than a straightforward comparison based on the recognition rate. In this paper, we propose a framework for feature set evaluation based on a collaborative setting. We use a weighted vote combination of recurrent neural network (RNN) classifiers, each trained with a particular feature set. This combination is modeled in a probabilistic framework as a mixture model and two methods for weight estimation are described. The main contribution of this paper is to quantify the importance of feature sets through the combination weights, which reflect their strength and complementarity. We chose the RNN classifier because of its state-of-the-art performance. Also, we provide the first feature set benchmark for this classifier. We evaluated several feature sets on the IFN/ENIT and RIMES databases of Arabic and Latin script, respectively. The resulting combination model is competitive with state-of-the-art systems.

INTEROCC is a seven-country population-based case-control study including 1906 adult meningioma cases and 5565 population controls. Incident cases were recruited between 2000 and 2004. A detailed occupational history was completed and job titles were coded into standard international occupational classifications. Estimates of mean workday exposure to individual metals and to welding fumes were assigned based on a job-exposure-matrix. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Although more controls than cases were ever exposed to metals (14 vs. 11 %, respectively), cases had higher median cumulative exposure levels. The ORs for ever vs. never exposure to any metal and to individual metals were mostly greater than 1.0, with the strongest association for exposure to iron (OR 1.26, 95 % CI 1.0-1.58). In women, an increased OR of 1.70 (95 % CI 1.0-2.89) was seen for ever vs never exposure to iron (OR in men 1.19, 95 % CI 0.91-1.54), with positive trends in relation with both cumulative and duration of exposure. These results remained after consideration of other occupational metal or chemical co-exposures. In conclusion, an apparent positive association between occupational exposure to iron and meningioma risk was observed, particularly among women. Considering the fact that meningioma is a hormone dependent tumor, the hypothesis that an interaction between iron and estrogen metabolism may be a potential mechanism for a carcinogenic effect of iron should be further investigated.

Several crystallographic structures and computational studies have shed light into their catalytic mechanism of action, identifying also the structural elements for the design of selective drug candidates. In this review, we first aim at summarizing the structural features characterizing human SIRTs. We then describe the observed mass and one-off movements related to conformational changes upon SIRT-mediated recognition events. Such information will be useful not only for rationalizing the design of new SIRT modulators, but also for improving the comprehension of SIRT-related biological roles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Bovine blood plasma samples were prepared with partial pressures of oxygen (pO(2)) ranging from 110 to 600 mmHg. R-1, R-2, and R-2* of the plasma with dissolved oxygen were measured using quantitative MRI sequences at 3 Tesla. Simulations were performed to predict the relative effects of dissolved oxygen and deoxyhemoglobin changes in hyperoxia calibrated BOLD. Results: The relaxivities of dissolved oxygen in plasma were found to be r(1, O2) = 1.97 +/- 0.09 x 10(-4) s(-1) mmHg(-1), r(2, O2) = 2.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(-4) s(-1) mmHg(-1), and r(2, O2)* = 2.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(-4) s(-1) mmHg(-1). Simulations predict that neither the transverse nor longitudinal relaxation rates of dissolved oxygen contribute significantly to the BOLD signal during hyperoxia. Conclusion: During hyperoxia, the increases in R-2 and R-2* of blood from dissolved oxygen in plasma are considerably less than the decreases in R-2 and R-2* from venous deoxyhemoglobin. R-1 effects due to dissolved oxygen are also predicted to be negligible. As a result, dissolved oxygen in arteries should not contribute significantly to the hyperoxic calibrated BOLD signal.

The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility of GABA measurements using a shim and motion navigated MEGA-SPECIAL sequence with LCModel, jMRUI and GANNET software. Motion and shim navigated MEGA-SPECIAL scans were acquired in 20 healthy subjects. Two acquisitions were performed for each of two regions: the anterior cingulate (ACC) and medial-parietal (PAR) cortices. Absolute GABA concentration () and GABA-to-Creatine ratio (GABA/Cr) were quantified using the three software packages. Using the within-subject coefficient of variation (CVws) as an index, reproducibility for both GABA(H20) and GABA/Cr ranged from 13 to 22 % in the ACC and 13 to 18 % in PAR using the three software packages. Based on CVws, GABA concentrations in both the ACC and PAR are reproducible using a shim and motion navigated MEGA-SPECIAL sequence with any of the three software packages, thus demonstrating the ability to quantify the pure form of GABA using these software in studies relating GABA to pathology and healthy behaviour.

Shh signaling has been implicated in controlling both the generation of oligodendrocytes (OLGs) during embryonic development and their production in adulthood. Although, some evidence points to a role of Shh signaling in OLG development, its involvement in OLG differentiation remains to be fully determined. The objective of this study was to assess whether Shh signaling is involved in OLG differentiation after neural stem cell commitment to the OLG lineage. To address these questions, we manipulated Shh signaling using cyclopamine, a potent inhibitor of Shh signaling activator Smoothened (Smo), alone or combined with the agonist SAG in OLG primary cultures and assessed expression of myelin-specific markers. We found that inactivation of Shh signaling caused a dose-dependent decrease in myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) in differentiating OLGs. Co-treatment of the cells with SAG reversed the inhibitory effect of cyclopamine on both myelin-specific protein levels and morphological changes associated with it. Further experiments are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which Shh signaling regulates OLG differentiation.

The potential role of nesfatin-1 on the regulation of energy balance, metabolic functions and inflammation is currently debated in obese humans. In the present study, nesfatin-1 fluctuations and their associations with metabolic factors were investigated in severely obese patients who underwent biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) and severely obese controls (SOC). Basic procedures: Sixty severely obese patients who underwent BPD/DS and 15 SOC (matched for BMI and age) were included in the study. Associations between nesfatin-1 levels and body composition, glucose metabolism, lipid profile as well as inflammatory markers were evaluated at baseline and over a postsurgeryl 2-month (12 M) period. Main findings: Body weight was reduced at 6 M and at 12 M in BPD/DS patients (P< 0.001). Nesfatin-1 levels were reduced at 6 M (women: P < 0.05) and at 12 M (men and women; 0.001) in BPD/DS patients. At baseline, nesfatin-1 levels negatively correlated with weight, fat (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) in the whole population (combined BPD/DS and SOC patients). At 12 M, nesfatin-1 concentrations positively correlated with weight, FM, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride and apoB values. At 12 M, % changes in nesfatin-1 were positively associated with% changes in weight, FM, FFM, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apoB and C-reactive protein. Conclusion: Nesfatin-1 levels decrease following BPD/DS-induced weight loss and are significantly associated with parameters of metabolic health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, recent studies reveal outer retinal dysfunctions in patients formerly afflicted with ROP. We have recently demonstrated that choroidal involution occurs early in retinopathy. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the choroidal involution and its long-term impact on retinal function. An oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model was used. In vitro and ex vivo assays were applied to evaluate cytotoxic effects of IL-1 beta on choroidal endothelium. Electroretinogram was used to evaluate visual function. We found that proinflammatory IL-1 beta was markedly increased in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid and positively correlated with choroidal degeneration in the early stages of retinopathy. IL-1 beta was found to be cytotoxic to choroid in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Long-term effects on choroidal involution included a hypoxic outer neuroretina, associated with a progressive Loss of RPE and photoreceptors, and visual deterioration. Early inhibition of IL-1 beta receptor preserved choroid, decreased subretinal hypoxia, and prevented RPE/photoreceptor death, resulting in life-long improved visual function in IL-1 receptor antagonist treated OIR animals. Together, these findings suggest a critical role for IL-1 beta-induced choroidal degeneration in outer retinal dysfunction. Neonatal therapy using IL-1 receptor antagonist preserves choroid and prevents protracted outer neuroretinal anomalies in OIR, suggesting IL-1 beta as a potential therapeutic target in ROP.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Modulation of glucose metabolism and metabolic connectivity by beta-amyloid	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; beta-amyloid; glucose metabolism; metabolic connectivity; positron emission tomography	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; F-18-FDG PET; MRI DATA; FDG-PET; VOLUME; DICHOTOMIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; HYPOTHESIS; BIOMARKER	Glucose hypometabolism in the pre-clinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been primarily associated with the APOE epsilon 4 genotype, rather than fibrillar beta-amyloid. In contrast, aberrant patterns of metabolic connectivity are more strongly related to beta-amyloid burden than APOE e4 status. A major limitation of previous studies has been the dichotomous classification of subjects as amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative. Dichotomous treatment of a continuous variable, such as beta-amyloid, potentially obscures the true relationship with metabolism and reduces the power to detect significant changes in connectivity. In the present work, we assessed alterations of glucose metabolism and metabolic connectivity as continuous function of beta-amyloid burden using positron emission tomography scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. Modeling beta-amyloid as a continuous variable resulted in better model fits and improved power compared to the dichotomous model. Using this continuous model, we found that both APOE e4 genotype and beta-amyloid burden are strongly associated with glucose hypometabolism at early stages of Alzheimer's disease. We also determined that the cumulative effects of beta-amyloid deposition result in a particular pattern of altered metabolic connectivity, which is characterized by global, synchronized hypometabolism at early stages of the disease process, followed by regionally heterogeneous, progressive hypometabolism.

To examine whether cortical electrical stimulation can promote motor recovery after white matter stroke, we delivered stimulation to a small or wide region of sensory-parietal cortex for two weeks in a rodent model of circumscribed subcortical capsular infarct. The sham-operated group (SOG) showed persistent and severe motor impairments together with decreased activation in bilateral sensorimotor cortices and striatum. In contrast, sensory-parietal cortex stimulation significantly improved motor recovery: final recovery levels were 72.9% of prelesion levels in the wide stimulation group (WSG) and 37% of prelesion levels in the small stimulation group (SSG). The microPET imaging showed reversal of cortical diaschisis in both groups: in both hemispheres for the WSG, and in the hemisphere ipsilateral to stimulation in the SSG. In addition, we observed activation of the corpus callosum and subcortical corticostriatal structures after stimulation. The results from the c-Fos mapping study were grossly consistent with the microPET imaging. Sensory-parietal cortex stimulation may therefore be a useful strategy for overcoming the limits of rehabilitative training in patients with severe forms of subcortical capsular infarct.

Evidential Reasoning-Based Condition Assessment Model for Offshore Gas Pipelines	JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES			English	Article						Offshore gas pipelines; Condition assessment; Evidential reasoning (ER); Analytic network process (ANP); Fuzzy set theory (FST)	NEURAL-NETWORK; WATER MAINS; OIL	Condition assessment of oil and gas pipelines is a significant component in pipeline operations and maintenance. Such assessments are used to ensure better decisions for repair and/or replacement to reduce pipelines' failure possibilities. Therefore, it is essential to have an effective condition assessment model for pipelines as their failure incidents may lead to catastrophic, economical, and environmental consequences. Current practices of assessing gas pipelines condition can be considered simplified for the intended purpose. They mainly depend on experts' opinions in interpreting inspection data, where the process is influenced by human subjectivity and reasoning uncertainty. In other words, they need detailed knowledge on the translation of raw inspection data into valuable information. This will surely lead to decisions lacking thorough and extensive review of the most influential aspects on pipelines' conditions. To address the weaknesses of current practices, this research proposes a new fuzzy-based methodology that utilizes an integrated analytic network process (ANP) and hierarchical evidential reasoning (HER) to develop a meticulous condition assessment model for offshore gas pipelines. The proposed model is validated using historical inspection reports that are obtained from a local pipeline operator in Qatar. The model delivers satisfactory outcomes in assessing offshore gas pipelines' conditions based on real field data.

Effects of continuous positive airway pressure and isocapnic-hypoxia on cerebral autoregulation in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							BRAIN BLOOD-FLOW; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; HUMANS; HYPERTENSION; MECHANISMS; STROKE; QUANTIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; HYPERCAPNIA; DIAGNOSIS	Cerebral autoregulation (CA) impairment may contribute to the increased risk of stroke associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). It is unknown if impaired CA is further exacerbated by isocapnic-hypoxia and whether it is improved by treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CA was assessed during wakefulness in 53 OSA patients (50.3 +/- 9.3 years) and 21 controls (49.8 +/- 8.6 years) at baseline and following a minimum of 1 month of effective CPAP therapy (OSA patients, n = 40). Control participants (n = 21) performed a follow-up visit to control for time effectswithin OSA patients between baseline and the post-CPAP visit. Beat-by-beat middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), and breath-by-breath end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PET, CO2) were monitored. CA was determined during normoxia and isocapnic-hypoxia using transfer function (phase and gain) and coherence analysis (including multiple and partial coherence (using MBP and PET, CO2 as inputs)) in the very low frequency range (0.03-0.07 Hz). OSA patients were divided into two subgroups (less severe and more severe) based upon themedian respiratory disturbance index (RDI). During normoxia, the more severe OSA patients (RDI 45.9 +/- 10.3) exhibited altered CA compared to controls and the less severe OSA patients (RDI 24.5 +/- 5.9). In contrast, during isocapnic-hypoxia, CA was similar between groups. CPAP had no effect on CA. In conclusion, CA is altered in the more severe OSA patients during normoxia but not during isocapnic-hypoxia and CPAP treatment does not impact CA.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging Initi; EPIGEN; IMAGEN; SYS	Novel genetic loci underlying human intracranial volume identified through genome-wide association	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							COMMON VARIANTS; 17Q21.31 MICRODELETION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE; BRAIN SIZE; IGF-I; METAANALYSIS; CONSORTIUM; GROWTH	Intracranial volume reflects the maximally attained brain size during development, and remains stable with loss of tissue in late life. It is highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined. In a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five previously unknown loci for intracranial volume and confirmed two known signals. Four of the loci were also associated with adult human stature, but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting for height. We found a high genetic correlation with child head circumference (rho(genetic) = 0.748), which indicates a similar genetic background and allowed us to identify four additional loci through meta-analysis (N-combined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume were also related to childhood and adult cognitive function, and Parkinson's disease, and were enriched near genes involved in growth pathways, including PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings identify the biological underpinnings of intracranial volume and their link to physiological and pathological traits.	[Adams, Hieab H.

J	Windt, JM; Nielsen, T; Thompson, E				Windt, Jennifer M.; Nielsen, Tore; Thompson, Evan			Does Consciousness Disappear in Dreamless Sleep?	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; BEHAVIOR DISORDER; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; INTEGRATED INFORMATION; MINDFULNESS MEDITATION; NREM SLEEP; BRAIN; MENTATION; INSOMNIA	Consciousness is often said to disappear in deep, dreamless sleep. We argue that this assumption is oversimplified. Unless dreamless sleep is defined as unconscious from the outset there are good empirical and theoretical reasons for saying that a range of different types of sleep experience, some of which are distinct from dreaming, can occur in all stages of sleep. We introduce a novel taxonomy for describing different kinds of dreamless sleep experiences and suggest research methods for their investigation. Future studies should focus on three areas: memory consolidation, sleep disorders, and sleep state (mis) perception. Our proposal suggests new directions for sleep and dream science, as well as for the neuroscience of consciousness, and can also inform the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.

Incidence, Predictors, and Postoperative Complications of Blood Transfusion in Thoracic and Lumbar Fusion Surgery: An Analysis of 13,695 Patients from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database	GLOBAL SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						blood transfusion; lumbar fusion; thoracic fusion; spine surgery; neurosurgery; NSQIP	SPINAL SURGERY; RISK-FACTORS; INFECTION	Study DesignRetrospective cohort study. ObjectiveTo identify predictive factors for blood transfusion and associated complications in lumbar and thoracic fusion surgeries. MethodsThe American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was used to identify patients who underwent lumbar or thoracic fusion from 2010 to 2013. Multivariate analysis was used to determine predictive factors and postoperative complications associated with transfusion. ResultsOut of 13,695 patients, 13,170 had lumbar fusion and 525 had thoracic fusion. The prevalence of transfusion was 31.8% for thoracic and 17.0% for lumbar fusion. The multivariate analysis showed that age between 50 and 60, age between 61 and 70, age>70, dyspnea, American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3, bleeding disease, multilevel surgery, extended surgical time, return to operation room, and higher preoperative blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were predictors of blood transfusion for lumbar fusion. Multilevel surgery, preoperative BUN, and extended surgical time were predictors of transfusion for thoracic fusion. Patients receiving transfusions who underwent lumbar fusion were more likely to develop wound infection, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction and had longer hospital stay. Patients receiving transfusions who underwent thoracic fusion were more likely to have extended hospital stay. ConclusionThis study characterizes incidence, predictors, and postoperative complications associated with blood transfusion in thoracic and lumbar fusion. Pre- and postoperative planning for patients deemed to be at high risk of requiring blood transfusion might reduce postoperative complications in this population.

The role of nuclear cardiac imaging in risk stratification of sudden cardiac death	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY			English	Review						Sudden cardiac death; PET; SPECT; ischemic heart disease; MIBG; sympathetic innervation; hibernating myocardium	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LEFT-VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION; CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; CHRONIC HEART-FAILURE; ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ASSOCIATION TASK-FORCE; IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR; LONG-TERM SURVIVAL; GUIDELINES WRITING COMMITTEE; INCREMENTAL PROGNOSTIC VALUE	Sudden cardiac death (SCD) represents a significant portion of all cardiac deaths. Current guidelines focus mainly on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as the main criterion for SCD risk stratification and management. However, LVEF alone lacks both sensitivity and specificity in stratifying patients. Recent research has provided interesting data which supports a greater role for advanced cardiac imaging in risk stratification and patient management. In this article, we will focus on nuclear cardiac imaging, including left ventricular function assessment, myocardial perfusion imaging, myocardial blood flow quantification, metabolic imaging, and neurohormonal imaging. We will discuss how these can be used to better understand SCD and better stratify patient with both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.	[Juneau, Daniel; Erthal, Fernanda; Chow, Benjamin J.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the relevance of personality on the basis of the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) to future experiences with tobacco, alcohol and cannabis. The test data were derived from the baseline assessment and first follow-up of the IMAGEN study, a European multicenter and multidisciplinary research project on adolescent mental health. In the present study 1004 participants were tested. The characterization of personality was conducted with the NEO-FFI at the age of 14 (T1). The data on substance use were collected with the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) questionnaire at the age of 16 (T2). For the statistical analysis, t-tests and univariate analyses of variance were performed. The scores of Conscientiousness at T1 were significantly lower for adolescents with tobacco, alcohol and cannabis experiences at T2. We found lower scores of Agreeableness at T1 in participants with tobacco and cannabis use at T2. Extraversion at T1 was significantly higher for adolescents with smoking experiences at T2. No significant associations between Neuroticism or Openness and future substance use were observed. Low scores of Conscientiousness and Agreeableness seem to have the greatest value for a prediction of later experiences with substance use. As the present study is the first one to examine the predictive value of the NEO-FFI for future substance use in an adolescent sample, further studies are necessary to enable a better applicability in a clinical context.

We used machine learning to combine the knowledge about n = 535 genes identified empirically as relevant to pain with the knowledge about the functions of thousands of genes. Starting from an accepted description of chronic pain as displaying systemic features described by the terms "learning" and "neuronal plasticity,"a functional genomics analysis proposed that among the functions of the 535 "pain genes," the biological processes "learning or memory" (P = 8.6 x 10(-64)) and " nervous system development" (P = 2.4 x 10(-40)) are statistically significantly overrepresented as compared with the annotations to these processes expected by chance. After establishing that the hypothesized biological processes were among important functional genomics features of pain, a subset of n 5 34 pain genes were found to be annotated with both Gene Ontology terms. Published empirical evidence supporting their involvement in chronic pain was identified for almost all these genes, including 1 gene identified in March 2016 as being involved in pain. By contrast, such evidence was virtually absent in a randomly selected set of 34 other human genes. Hence, the present computational functional genomics-based method can be used for candidate gene selection, providing an alternative to established methods.

The Special Immunization Clinics (SICs) Network was established to standardize patient management and assess outcomes after reimmunization. The study objective was to describe the first 2 years of the network's implementation. Methods: Twelve SICs were established across Canada by infectious diseases specialists and allergists. Inclusion criteria were as follows: local reaction >= 10 cm, allergic symptoms < 24 hours postimmunization, neurologic symptoms and other AEFI or medical conditions of concern. Eligible patients underwent a standardized evaluation, causality assessment was performed, immunization recommendations were made by expert physicians and patients were followed up to capture AEFI. After individual consent, data were transferred to a central database for analysis. Results: From June 2013 to May 2015, 151 patients were enrolled. Most were referred for prior AEFI (132/151, 87%): 42 (32%) for allergic-like reactions, 31 (23%) for injection-site reactions, 20 (15%) for neurologic symptoms and 39 (30%) for other systemic symptoms. Nineteen patients (13%) were seen for underlying conditions that complicated immunization. Reimmunization was recommended for 109 patients, 60 of whom (55%) were immunized and followed up. Eleven patients (18%) experienced recurrence of their AEFI; none were serious (eg, resulting in hospitalization, permanent disability or death). Conclusions: The most frequent reasons for referral to a SIC were allergiclike events and injection site reactions. Reimmunization was safe in most patients. Larger studies are needed to determine outcomes for specific types of AEFI.

As in other vertebrates, respiration in lampreys is generated centrally in the brainstem. It is characterized by the presence of a fast and a slow respiratory rhythm. The anatomical and the basic physiological properties of the neural networks underlying the generation of the fast rhythm have been more thoroughly investigated; less is known about the generation of the slow respiratory rhythm. Comparative aspects with respiratory generators in other vertebrates as well as the mechanisms of modulation of respiration in association with locomotion are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A novel cognitive intervention for compulsive checking: Targeting maladaptive beliefs about memory	JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Compulsive checking; Beliefs about memory; Meta-memory; Memory; OCD; Cognitive-behaviour therapy	EXCESSIVE REASSURANCE SEEKING; BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT; REY-OSTERRIETH; DISORDER OCD; CONFIDENCE; ANXIETY; DISTRUST; VALIDITY; NEUROPSYCHOLOGY; COMPARABILITY	Background and objectives: Compulsive checking is one of the most common symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Recently it has been proposed that those who check compulsively may believe their memory is poor, rather than having an actual memory impairment. The current study sought to develop and assess a brief cognitive intervention focused on improving maladaptive beliefs about memory, as they pertain to both checking symptoms and memory performance. Methods: Participants (N = 24) with a diagnosis of OCD and clinical levels of checking symptomatology were randomly assigned either to receive two weekly 1-hour therapy sessions or to self-monitor during a similar waitlist period. Time spent checking, checking symptoms, maladaptive beliefs about memory, and visuospatial memory were assessed both pre- and post-treatment/waitlist Results: Results showed that compared to the waitlist condition, individuals in the treatment condition displayed significant decreases in their maladaptive beliefs about memory and checking symptoms from pre- to post-intervention. They also exhibited increased recall performance on a measure of visuospatial memory. Changes in beliefs about memory were predictors of reduced post-intervention checking, but were not predictive of increased post-intervention memory scores. Limitations: The lack of long term follow-up data and use of a waitlist control leave questions about the stability and specificity of the intervention. Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary evidence that strategies targeting beliefs about memory may be worthy of inclusion in cognitive-behavioural approaches to treating compulsive checking.

The considered gray matter indices were cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (CSA). Twenty-eight young women (age range 17-22 years) completed 24 training sessions over the course of 3 months (12 weeks, 24 sessions), showing expected performance improvements. CT and CSA values for the training group were compared with those of a matched control group. Statistical analyses were computed using a ROI framework defined by brain areas distinguished by their genetic underpinning. The interaction between group and time was analyzed. Middle temporal, ventral frontal, inferior parietal cortices, and pars opercularis were the regions where the training group showed conservation of gray matter with respect to the control group. These regions support working memory, resistance to interference, and inhibition. Furthermore, an interaction with baseline intelligence differences showed that the expected decreasing trend at the biological level for individuals showing relatively low intelligence levels at baseline was attenuated by the completed training.

RUSC2 is a gene found on chromosome 9p13.3 that codes for iporin, a ubiquitous protein with high expression in the brain that interacts with Rab proteins (GTPases implicated in intracellular protein trafficking). Although mutations in Rab proteins have been described as causing brain abnormalities and intellectual disability, until now no disease-causing mutations in RUSC2 have ever been reported in humans. We describe, to our knowledge for the first time, three patients with inherited homozygous nonsense mutations identified in RUSC2 on whole-exome sequencing. All three patients had central hypotonia, microcephaly, and moderate to severe intellectual disability. Two patients had additional features of early-onset epilepsy and absence of the splenium. This report adds to the ever-expanding landscape of genetic causes of intellectual disability and increases our understanding of the cellular processes underlying this important neurological entity.

Prefrontal activity decline in women under a single dose of diazepam during rule-guided responses: an fMRI study	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Benzodiazepine; Diazepam; Sex differences; fMRI; Rule-guided behavior; Frontal lobes	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID LEVELS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; STOP-SIGNAL TASK; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; PERSISTENT ACTIVITY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES	Daily life events confront us with new situations demanding responses to usual and unusual rules. Diazepam (DZ), a clinically important drug, facilitates the inhibitory activity of the GABAergic system. Prefrontal cortex, rich in DZ receptors, coordinates necessary resources to direct actions according to rules. The balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity is critical to achieve optimal function of brain systems leading to complex functions. Major sex differences in the physiological mechanisms of the GABAergic system have been reported. However, the differential influence of DZ on men and women in neural activity during behavior directed by frontal lobes remains unexplored. The ability of healthy volunteers to select responses following usual/congruent and novel/incongruent rules, and brain correlates were measured with fMRI under the administration of DZ and a placebo. 10 mg of DZ was enough to decrease the performance in a different manner between men and women. While reaction times increased in both men and women, women committed more errors selecting responses than men under DZ. Men demonstrated increased activity, while women demonstrated decreased activity in frontal regions involved in response selection of rules. These findings could have important consequences in understanding the differential influences of DZ between the sexes in complex daily life situations. More importantly, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding the differential effects on men and women of drugs widely employed by society, thereby achieves better therapeutic results and avoids side effects that the present study revealed to be different between sexes.

However, the relationship between resting-state functional connectivity (FC) reorganization in the sensorimotor network and motor disability in MS is not well understood. This study used resting-state fMRI, T1-weighted and T2-weighted, and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging to investigate the relationship between abnormal FC in the sensorimotor network and upper limb motor disability in people with MS, as well as the impact of disease-related structural abnormalities within this network. Specifically, the differences in FC of the left hemisphere hand motor region between MS participants with preserved (n=17) and impaired (n=26) right hand function, compared with healthy controls (n=20) was investigated. Differences in brain atrophy and MT ratio measured at the global and regional levels were also investigated between the three groups. Motor preserved MS participants had stronger FC in structurally intact visual information processing regions relative to motor impaired MS participants. Motor impaired MS participants showed weaker FC in the sensorimotor and somatosensory association cortices and more severe structural damage throughout the brain compared with the other groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that regional MTR predicted motor disability beyond the impact of global atrophy whereas regional grey matter volume did not. More importantly, as the first multimodal analysis combining resting-state fMRI, T1-weighted, T2-weighted and MTR images in MS, we demonstrate how a combination of structural and functional changes may contribute to motor impairment or preservation in MS.

The baby was found to have a tense fontanelle leading to imaging that showed a 5.5 cm right intraventricular mass centred in the atrium, hydrocephalus and extensive surrounding vasogenic oedema. The mass was avidly enhancing with a few large associated vessels suggesting high vascularity. The condition of the baby was acutely deteriorating. He had multiple seizures followed by persistent low level of consciousness in the third day of life. His clinical decline prompted decision to proceed with surgical resection and preoperative embolization. A large single feeder (the right posterolateral choroidal artery) was embolized leading to near complete obliteration of the tumour blush. Embolization likely facilitated subsequent surgery the next day. This is based on an estimated blood loss of 250 ml in this 3 kg baby without haemodynamic instability. Gross total resection was achieved with a single surgery and the diagnosis was choroid plexus papilloma. Utilization of this combined approach in this preterm baby had led to survival in this potentially curable disease.

Methods: This is a single-center and retrospective study. All children without traumatic brain injury who underwent a brain MRI during pediatric intensive care unit stays were included. To assess the exam's contribution, the patient's medical condition at the time of the MRI exam was blindly and separately exposed to a pediatric neurologist and a pediatric intensivist. Results: During the study period, 87 patients (7.5%) underwent a brain MRI. Median age was 4 months and 13 children (14.9%) died in pediatric intensive care unit. The most common final diagnosis was postanoxic encephalopathy. Brain MRI was abnormal in 68 patients (78.2%). No serious adverse event occurred during the transport. The neurologist and the intensivist considered brain MRI as indicated during pediatric intensive care unit stay in 65 (74.7%) and 68 patients (78.2%). They deemed that brain MRI had a diagnostic contribution in 76 (87.4%) and 60 (69.0%) patients, respectively. A therapeutic change consecutive to MRI findings occurred in 19 patients (21.8%) and MRI results were associated with a decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment in 21 patients (24.1%). Conclusion: Brain MRI is one component of neuromonitoring, and this study suggests a substantial diagnostic contribution, although its therapeutic impact appears limited to specific diagnoses.

Although mutations in over 100 X-linked genes associated to intellectual disability have been identified, only a few X-linked intellectual disability proteins have been intensively studied. Hence, the molecular mechanisms underlying the majority of X-linked intellectual disability disorders remain poorly understood. A substantial fraction of X-linked intellectual disability genes encode nuclear proteins, suggesting that elucidating their functions in the regulation of transcription may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of intellectual disability. Recent studies have uncovered mechanisms by which mutations of the gene encoding plant homeodomain (PHD)-like finger protein 6 (PHF6) contribute to the pathogenesis of the X-linked intellectual disability disorder Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS). PHF6 plays a critical role in the migration of neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo, and patient-specific mutations disrupt the ability of PHF6 to promote neuronal migration. Interestingly, PHF6 physically associates with the PAF1 transcriptional elongation complex and thereby drives neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. PHF6 also interacts with the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex and with the nucleolar transcriptional regulator UBF, though the biological role of these interactions remains to be characterized. In other studies, PHF6 mRNA has been identified as the target of the microRNA miR-128 in the cerebral cortex, providing new insights into regulation of PHF6 function in neuronal migration. Importantly, deregulation of PHF6 function in neuronal migration triggers the formation of white matter heterotopias that harbor neuronal hyperexcitability, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of intellectual disability and seizures in BFLS. Collectively, these studies are beginning to provide key insights into the molecular pathogenesis of BFLS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Neuropsychology of Adolescent Sexual Offending: Testing an Executive Dysfunction Hypothesis	SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT			English	Article						executive functioning; juveniles; sexual deviance; sex offenders; juvenile sex offenders	VERSION PCL-YV; PSYCHOPATHY CHECKLIST; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; METAANALYSIS; ATTENTION; ABUSE; DELINQUENCY; DEVIANCE; DISORDER; HISTORY	Although executive dysfunctions are commonly hypothesized to contribute to sexual deviance or aggression, evidence of this relationship is scarce and its specificity is unproven, especially among adolescents. The objective of this study was to compare the executive functioning (EF) of adolescents with sexual offense convictions (ASOC) to that of non-sex-delinquents (NSD). A secondary goal was to assess the relationship among specific sexual offense characteristics (i.e., victim age), history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and EF. It was hypothesized that as a group, ASOC would present similar EF profiles as NSD. It was further hypothesized that ASOC with child victims would present significantly higher rates of CSA and more severe impairment of EF than ASOC with peer-aged or older victims and NSD. A total of 183 male adolescents (127 ASOC and 56 NSD) were interviewed to collect demographic information, sexual development history, history of CSA, an assessment of living conditions, and history of delinquency and sexual offending. Participants were administered the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System and the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Youth Version. In accord with the first hypothesis, ASOC and NSD presented similar EF scores, well below normative values. Thus, EF deficits may not characterize the profiles of adolescents with sexual behavior problems. Contrarily to our second hypothesis, however, offending against children and or experiencing CSA were not associated with poorer EF performance. On the contrary, ASOC with child victims obtained significantly higher scores on measures of higher order EF than both ASOC with peer-aged or older victims and NSD. Implications of these results and future directions are discussed.

Evidence indicates dysfunction in the thalamus, the olivocerebellar loops, and intermittent cortical engagement. Pathology of the cerebellum, a structure with architecture intrinsically predisposed to oscillatory activity, has also been implicated in ET as shown by clinical, neuroimaging, and pathological studies. Despite electrophysiological studies assessing cerebellar impairment in ET being scarce, their impact is tangible, as summarized in this review. The electromyography-magnetoencephalography combination provided the first direct evidence of pathological alteration in cortico-subcortical communication, with a significant emphasis on the cerebellum. Furthermore, complex electromyography studies showed disruptions in the timing of agonist and antagonist muscle activation, a process generally attributed to the cerebellum. Evidence pointing to cerebellar engagement in ET has also been found in electrooculography measurements, cerebellar repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, and, indirectly, in complex analyses of the activity of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (an area primarily receiving inputs from the cerebellum), which is also used in the advanced treatment of ET. In summary, further progress in therapy will require comprehensive electrophysiological and physiological analyses to elucidate the precise mechanisms leading to disease symptoms. The cerebellum, as a major node of this dynamic oscillatory network, requires further study to aid this endeavor.

J	Ferraro, A				Ferraro, Angela			Theorizing epigenesis in a time of preexistence: From the end of the seventeenth century to the 1720s	HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Epigenesis; Preexistence; Malebranchism; Materialism		According to a classic periodization in the history of science, biological thought as it emerged in France from the last decades of the seventeenth century to the 1740s was strongly committed to the doctrine of the preexistence of germs. Nicolas Malebranche's role in disseminating this paradigm, particularly in the milieu of the Academie Royale des Sciences during the years when Bernard Le Bouyer de Fontenelle was its secretary, has been studied in detail, especially by Jacques Roger. However, much less has been said about the authors who argued against this doctrine prior to the appearance of the relevant pieces by Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and Denis Diderot. I aim to examine a series of French medical treatises and clandestine manuscripts that outlined a mechanist theory of epigenesis, between the end of the seventeenth century and the 1720s, to bring to light the strategies-often quite original-that allowed them to achieve this result. One interesting case is the heterodox readers of Malebranche, which use some of his own arguments (notably on the physiology of brain traces and the laws of nature) both against preexistence and to support epigenesis. I inquire into the historical worth of the positions defended by these authors as well as into the connections existing between the history of epigenesis and that of materialism in the early modern era.

To date, few studies have investigated the white-matter substrates of MSL in healthy aging, and none have addressed how fiber pathways differences may contribute to the age-related consolidation deficit. Accordingly, we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to explore how white-matter characteristics relate to performance using an explicit MSL task in young and older participants. Analysis revealed that initial learning scores were correlated to white-matter microstructure in the corticospinal tract and within the corpus callosum regardless of age. Furthermore, sleep-dependent consolidation scores, in young adults only, were related to white-matter tract organization in a frontal area where several major fiber bundles cross each other. These findings further our understanding of the neural correlates of MSL in healthy aging and provide the first evidence that age-related white-matter differences in tract configuration may underlie the age-related motor memory consolidation deficit.

This article aims to: (1) describe normative data for the parent-rated SPRS-C and, (2) evaluate the discriminant validity of the SPRS-C. Methods: For Aim 1, participants were parents of typically developing children (TDC) aged 5-14 years (N=200). For Aim 2, participants with ABI were aged 5-14 years (n=26). A matched group of TDC was sampled from the larger normative sample to serve as a control group (n=26). Results: For Aim 1, SPRS-C scores across the 10 age-bands were in the higher ranges. Correlation coefficients of SPRS-C total score with child's age and parent occupational skill level were not statistically significant. For Aim 2, SPRS-C scores for the ABI group were significantly lower than the control group. Conclusions: These data provide a guide for clinical interpretation of the SPRS-C for measuring psychosocial functioning in children with ABI.

However it also contains methylmercury which can have severe effects on fetal neurodevelopment. The objective of this study was to assess the fish intake of a selected group of pregnant women from Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago and evaluate prenatal mercury exposure, using the placenta as a biomarker. Method: Food frequency questionnaires and placental samples were obtained from participating parturients at the time of delivery at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica (N =100, from November 2012 to March 2013) and the Mt Hope Women's hospital in St Joseph, Trinidad & Tobago (N = 30, in June 2015). The participants were asked to identify the species of fish and the frequency of consumption. Placental samples were analysed for mercury using cold vapour atomic absorption. Results: The fish consumption preferences for pregnant women, varies based on the marine fish catch production of each country. The main fish species that contributed to the highest estimated methyl mercury exposure in Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were cod and shark, respectively. There was a weak association between maternal fish intake and placental mercury concentrations. The mean placental mercury concentrations in Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were 0.74 +/- 0.5 mu g/kg and 1.46 +/- 0.6 mu g/kg, wet weight respectively. Conclusion: The results from this study showed an influence of Caribbean fish intake preferences on mercury exposure and thus a recommendation for continuous bio-monitoring for public health purposes.

Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying probabilistic models remains important because Bayesian models provide a computational framework, rather than specifying mechanistic processes. Here, we propose a deterministic neural-network model which estimates and represents probability distributions from observable events-a phenomenon related to the concept of probability matching. Our model learns to represent probabilities without receiving any representation of them from the external world, but rather by experiencing the occurrence patterns of individual events. Our neural implementation of probability matching is paired with a neural module applying Bayes' rule, forming a comprehensive neural scheme to simulate human Bayesian learning and inference. Our model also provides novel explanations of base-rate neglect, a notable deviation from Bayes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

And because RDoC will eventually impact clinical psychiatry, some have feared that it will transform clinical psychiatry in a mindless and applied neurobehavioral science. We argue that if RDoC is officially endorsing a kind of reductionism, the particular kind of reductionism it endorses is not suffering from the shortcomings of more classical forms of reductionism. Because of that, at least in principle, RDoC could enrich rather than impoverish clinical psychiatry. This paper raises few potential problems of the RDoC for clinical psychiatry caused by its implicit epistemological reductionism.

Comprehensive studies detailing the regulatory role of TFs during this reprogramming process could help increase its efficiency. This study aimed to find the TFs with the greatest influences on the generation of iHeps from fibroblasts, and to further understand their roles in the regulation of the gene expression program. Here, we used systems biology approaches to analyze high quality expression data sets in combination with TF-binding sites data and protein-protein interactions data during the direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to iHeps. Our results revealed two main patterns for differentially expressed genes (DEGs): up-regulated genes were categorized as hepatic-specific pattern, and down-regulated genes were categorized as mesoderm-and fibroblast-specific pattern. Interestingly, hepatic-specific genes co-expressed and were regulated by hepatic-specific TFs, specifically Hnf4a and Foxa2. Conversely, the mesoderm-and fibroblast-specific pattern was mainly silenced by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) members, including Suz12, Mtf2, Ezh2, and Jarid2. Independent analysis of both the gene and core regulatory network of DE-TFs showed significant roles for Hnf4a, Foxa2, and PRC2 members in the regulation of the gene expression program and in biological processes during the direct conversion process. Altogether, using systems biology approaches, we clarified the role of Hnf4a and Foxa2 as hepatic-specific TFs, and for the first time, introduced the PRC2 complex as the main regulator that favors the direct reprogramming process in cooperation with hepatic-specific factors.

Circadian rhythms identified in Caenorhabditis elegans by in vivo long-term monitoring of a bioluminescent reporter	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						C. elegans; circadian rhythms; luminescence; temperature; light	C-ELEGANS; GENE-EXPRESSION; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; CLOCK GENES; PROTEIN; NEURONS; LIGHT; TIME; TEMPERATURE; RECEPTOR	Circadian rhythms are based on endogenous clocks that allow organisms to adjust their physiology and behavior by entrainment to the solar day and, in turn, to select the optimal times for most biological variables. Diverse model systems-including mice, flies, fungi, plants, and bacteria-have provided important insights into the mechanisms of circadian rhythmicity. However, the general principles that govern the circadian clock of Caenorhabditis elegans have remained largely elusive. Here we report robust molecular circadian rhythms in C. elegans recorded with a bioluminescence assay in vivo and demonstrate the main features of the circadian system of the nematode. By constructing a lucif-erase- based reporter coupled to the promoter of the suppressor of activated let-60 Ras (sur-5) gene, we show in both population and single-nematode assays that C. elegans expresses similar to 24-h rhythms that can be entrained by light/dark and temperature cycles. We provide evidence that these rhythms are temperature-compensated and can be re-entrained after phase changes of the synchronizing agents. In addition, we demonstrate that light and temperature sensing requires the photoreceptors LITE and GUR-3, and the cyclic nucleotidegated channel subunit TAX-2. Our results shed light on C. elegans circadian biology and demonstrate evolutionarily conserved features in the circadian system of the nematode.

Here we used functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and a whole-brain, searchlight multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to search for areas in which local fMRI patterns could result in identity classification as a function of sensory modality. We found several areas supporting face or voice stimulus classification based on fMRI responses, consistent with previous reports; the classification maps overlapped across modalities in a single area of right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Remarkably, we also found several cortical areas, mostly located along the middle temporal gyrus, in which local fMRI patterns resulted in identity "cross-classification": vocal identity could be classified based on fMRI responses to the faces, or the reverse, or both. These findings are suggestive of a series of cortical identity representations increasingly abstracted from the input modality.

Pharmacological approaches and generation of NTSR1 and NTSR2-deficient mice allowed to determine the NT-induced antipsychotic like behavior, the inhibitory of weak fear memory and the nociceptive signaling in a rat formalin tonic pain model to NTSR1. Conversely, the effects of NT on thermal and tonic nociceptions were mediated by NTSR2. However, the role of NTSR3/sortilin on the neurotensinergic system was not investigated. Here, by using C57BI/6J mouse model in which the gene coding for NTSR3/sortilin has been inactivated, we observed a modification of the expression of both NTSR2 and NT itself. Quantitative PCR and protein expression using Western blot analyses and AlphaLisa (TM) technology resulted in the observation that brain NTSR2 as well as brain and blood NT were 2-fold increased in KO mice leading to a resistance of these mice to thermal and chemical pain. These data confirm that NTSR3/sortilin interacts with other NT receptors (i.e., NTSR2) and that its deletion modifies also the affinity of this receptor to NT.

Previously, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we reported reduced cortico-striatal activity in patients with PD who also had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. those who did not (non-MCI). We followed up these patients to investigate the longitudinal effect on the neural activity. Twenty-four non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (non-MCI: 12, MCI: 12) were included in the study. Each participant underwent two fMRIs while performing the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task 20 months apart. The non-MCI patients recruited the usual cognitive corticostriatal loop at the first and second sessions (Time 1 and Time 2, respectively). However, decreased activity was observed in the cerebellum and occipital area and increased activity was observed in the medial prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe during planning set-shift at Time 2. Increased activity in the precuneus was also demonstrated while executing set-shifts at Time 2. The MCI patients revealed more activity in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes during planning set-shifts, and in the parietal and occipital lobes, precuneus, and cerebellum, during executing set-shift at Time 2. Analysis regrouping of both groups of PD patients revealed that hippocampal and thalamic activity at Time 1 was associated with less cognitive decline over time. Our results reveal that functional alteration along the time-points differed between the non-MCI and MCI patients. They also underline the importance of preserving thalamic and hippocampal function with respect to cognitive decline over time.

ATLAS Collaboration	Study of hard double-parton scattering in four-jet events in pp collisions root s=7 TeV with the ATLAS experiment	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments)	(P)OVER-BAR-P COLLISIONS; MULTIPARTON INTERACTIONS; HADRONIC COLLISIONS; S=1.8 TEV; COLLIDER; QCD; CALORIMETER; EQUATIONS; TESTS	Inclusive four-jet events produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of mass energy of root s = 7 TeV are analysed for the presence of hard double-parton scattering using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 37.3 pb(-1), collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The contribution of hard double-parton scattering to the production of four -jet events is extracted using an artificial neural network, assuming that hard double-parton scattering can be approximated by an uncorrelated overlaying of dijet events. For events containing at least four jets with transverse momentum PT >= 20 GeV and pseudorapidity vertical bar eta vertical bar <= 4.4, and at least one having pT >= 42.5 GeV, the contribution of hard double-parton scattering is estimated to be fDps = 0.092(-0.011)(+0.0005) (stat.) (+0.03337)(-0.011) (syst.). After combining this measurement with those of the inclusive dijet and four -jet cross -sections in the appropriate phase space regions, the effective cross-section, sigma(eff,) was determined to be sigma(eff) = 14.9(-1.0)(+1.2) (stat.) (+5.1)(-3.8) (syst.) mb. This result is consistent within the quoted uncertainties with previous measurements of sigma(eff), performed at centre-of-mass energies between 63 GeV and 8 TeV using various final states, and it corresponds to 21(-6%)(+7) of the total inelastic cross-section measured at root s = 7 TeV. The distributions of the observables sensitive to the contribution of hard double-parton scattering, corrected for detector effects, are also provided.	[Jackson, P.; Leel, L.; Petridis, A.; White, M.

This question is of crucial importance given the recent demonstration in both animals and humans that a period of blindness early in life permanently affects the brain networks dedicated to visual, auditory, and multisensory processing [1-16]. To address this issue, we compared a group of adults who had been treated for congenital bilateral cataracts during early infancy with a group of normally sighted controls on a task requiring simple detection of lateralized visual and auditory targets, presented alone or in combination. Redundancy gains obtained from the audiovisual conditions were similar between groups and surpassed the reaction time distribution predicted by Miller's race model. However, in comparison to controls, cataract-reversal patients were faster at processing simple auditory targets and showed differences in how they shifted attention across modalities. Specifically, they were faster at switching attention from visual to auditory inputs than in the reverse situation, while an opposite pattern was observed for controls. Overall, these results reveal that the absence of visual input during the first months of life does not prevent the development of audiovisual integration but enhances the salience of simple auditory inputs, leading to a different crossmodal distribution of attentional resources between auditory and visual stimuli.

This coupling or "entrainment" is thought to facilitate beat extraction and rhythm perception in temporally structured sounds, such as music. As a consequence of such entrainment, the auditory cortex responds to an omitted (silent) sound in a regular sequence. Although previous studies suggest that the auditory brainstem frequency-following response (FFR) exhibits some of the beat-related effects found in the cortex, it is unknown whether omissions of sounds evoke a brainstem response. We simultaneously recorded cortical and brainstem responses to isochronous and irregular sequences of consonant-vowel syllable /da/ that contained sporadic omissions. The auditory cortex responded strongly to omissions, but we found no evidence of evoked responses to omitted stimuli from the auditory brainstem. However, auditory brainstem responses in the isochronous sound sequence were more consistent across trials than in the irregular sequence. These results indicate that the auditory brainstem faithfully encodes short-term acoustic properties of a stimulus and is sensitive to sequence regularity, but does not entrain to isochronous sequences sufficiently to generate overt omission responses, even for sequences that evoke such responses in the cortex. These findings add to our understanding of the processing of sound regularities, which is an important aspect of human cognitive abilities like rhythm, music and speech perception. (C) 2016 IBRO.

In fact, neurons functionally connect each other in an organized Hebbian process, wherein their wiring and firing are intimately related. Moreover, neuronal ensembles have been suggested to be strongly implicated in sensory processing. Within these ensembles, neurons may be sharply or broadly tuned in relation to the stimulus. Therefore, it is important to determine the relationship between the response selectivity of neurons and their functional connectivity pattern across species. In the present investigation, we sought to compare the stimulus-evoked functional connectivity between the broadly tuned and the sharply tuned neurons in two species exhibiting different cortical organization for orientation selectivity: cats (columnar-organized) and mice (salt-and-pepper organization). In addition, we examined the distribution of connectivity weights within cell-assemblies in the visual cortex during visual adaptation. First, we report that the sharply tuned neurons exhibited higher synchrony index than the broadly tuned cells in the cat visual cortex. On the contrary, in mice, the broadly tuned cells displayed higher connectivity index. Second, a significant correlation was found between the connectivity strength and the difference of preferred orientations of neurons for both species. Finally, we observed a systematic adjustment of the connectivity weights within neuronal ensembles in mouse primary visual cortex similarly to the cat V1. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Trial and error is important as motor behavior is shaped by successful and unsuccessful movements. As an experimental model, we designed a task in which human participants make reaching movements to a hidden target and receive positive reinforcement when successful. We identified somatic and reinforcement-based sources of plasticity on the basis of changes in functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI before and after learning. The neuroimaging data revealed reinforcement-related changes in both motor and somatosensory brain areas in which a strengthening of connectivity was related to the amount of positive reinforcement during learning. Areas of prefrontal cortex were similarly altered in relation to reinforcement, with connectivity between sensorimotor areas of putamen and the reward-related ventromedial prefrontal cortex strengthened in relation to the amount of successful feedback received. In other analyses, we assessed connectivity related to changes in movement direction between trials, a type of variability that presumably reflects exploratory strategies during learning. We found that connectivity in a network linking motor and somatosensory cortices increased with trial-to-trial changes in direction. Connectivity varied as well with the change in movement direction following incorrect movements. Here the changes were observed in a somatic memory and decision making network involving ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and second somatosensory cortex. Our results point to the idea that the initial stages of motor learning are not wholly motor but rather involve plasticity in somatic and prefrontal networks related both to reward and exploration.

MTAs bind to and alter the stability of microtubules, causing cell death in mitosis. We describe DZ-2384, a preclinical compound that exhibits potent antitumor activity in models of multiple cancer types. It has an unusually high safety margin and lacks neurotoxicity in rats at effective plasma concentrations. DZ-2384 binds the vinca domain of tubulin in a distinct way, imparting structurally and functionally different effects on microtubule dynamics compared to other vinca-binding compounds. X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy studies demonstrate that DZ-2384 causes straightening of curved protofilaments, an effect proposed to favor polymerization of tubulin. Both DZ-2384 and the vinca alkaloid vinorelbine inhibit microtubule growth rate; however, DZ-2384 increases the rescue frequency and preserves the microtubule network in nonmitotic cells and in primary neurons. This differential modulation of tubulin results in a potent MTA therapeutic with enhanced safety.

Conversely, the inhibition of DC maturation is a central mechanism of immune tolerance. The control of the DC maturation process relies on the integration of several cellular stimulatory or inhibitory signals. The soluble factors and their receptors controlling this central aspect of DC biology are incompletely characterized. We show that murine bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) maturation induced by LPS, as opposed to polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid or cytosine-phosphate-guanine, is robustly inhibited by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a previously identified immunosuppressive cytokine. Using BMDC from wild type and conditional knockout mice, we show that neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a known receptor of VEGF, is necessary to suppress LPS-dependent BMDC maturation. The absence of NRP-1 had no ostensible effects on the biology of BMDC in the absence of VEGF. However, NRP-1-deficient BMDC remained completely insensitive to the VEGF-dependent inhibition of BMDC maturation in culture. In the presence of VEGF, NRP-1 directly interacted with the LPS receptor TLR4 and suppressed downstream signaling through ERK and NF-kappa b, resulting in a sharp inhibition of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD86) expression as well as proinflammatory cytokine production. Consequently, we identify NRP-1 as a target to optimize DC maturation within environments that are rich in VEGF, such as tumors.	[Oussa, Nougboli A.

The study of these individuals with specific musical anhedonia may be crucial to understand better the neural correlates underlying musical reward. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that musically induced pleasure may arise from the interaction between auditory cortical networks and mesolimbic reward networks. If such interaction is critical for music-induced pleasure to emerge, then those individuals who do not experience it should show alterations in the cortical-mesolimbic response. In the current study, we addressed this question using fMRI in three groups of 15 participants, each with different sensitivity to music reward. We demonstrate that the music anhedonic participants showed selective reduction of activity for music in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), but normal activation levels for a monetary gambling task. Furthermore, this group also exhibited decreased functional connectivity between the right auditory cortex and ventral striatum (including the NAcc). In contrast, individuals with greater than average response to music showed enhanced connectivity between these structures. Thus, our results suggest that specific musical anhedonia may be associated with a reduction in the interplay between the auditory cortex and the subcortical reward network, indicating a pivotal role of this interaction for the enjoyment of music.

Identifying the circuitry underlying copulation is a necessary step towards understanding universal principles of circuit operation, and how circuit elements are recruited into the production of ordered action sequences. Here, we identify key sex-specific neurons that mediate copulation in Drosophila, and define a sexually dimorphic motor circuit in the male abdominal ganglion that mediates the action sequence of initiating and terminating copulation. This sexually dimorphic circuit composed of three neuronal classes motor neurons, interneurons and mechanosensory neurons controls the mechanics of copulation. By correlating the connectivity, function and activity of these neurons we have determined the logic for how this circuitry is coordinated to generate this male-specific behavior, and sets the stage for a circuit-level dissection of active sensing and modulation of copulatory behavior.

However, how the encoding of sensory inputs is shaped during synchronized movements along the sensory pathway remains unknown. To investigate this, we simultaneously recorded brainstem and cortical electro-encephalographic activity while participants listened to periodic amplitude-modulated tones. Participants listened either without moving or while tapping in sync on every second beat. Cortical responses were identified at the envelope modulation rate (beat frequency), whereas brainstem responses were identified at the partials frequencies of the chord and at their modulation by the beat frequency (sidebands). During sensorimotor synchronization, cortical responses at beat frequency were larger than during passive listening. Importantly, brainstem responses were also enhanced, with a selective amplification of the sidebands, in particular at the lower-pitched tone of the chord, and no significant correlation with electromyographic measures at tapping frequency. These findings provide first evidence for an online gain in the cortical and subcortical encoding of sounds during synchronized movement, selective to behavior-relevant sound features. Moreover, the frequency-tagging method to isolate concurrent brainstem and cortical activities even during actual movements appears promising to reveal coordinated processes along the human auditory pathway.

In the present study, we investigated the roles. the toxicity reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunctioin45incetile.. of LCA in PC-3 and autophagy. deficient, androgen independent DU-145 cells. LCA induced ER stress-related proteins, such as CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), and the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha (p-eIF2 alpha) c-and-Jon N terminal kinases (p-JNK) in both cancer cell-types. The p53 upregulatedmodulator ofapoptosis (PUMA) and B cell lymphoma-like protein 11 (BIM) levels were decreased at overtly toxic LCA concentrations, although PUMA levels increased at lower LCA concentrations in both cell lines LCA induced autophagyrelated conversion of microtuhuie-associated proteins light chain 3B (LC3I3I - LC3BII), and autophagy-related protein ATG5 in PC-3 cells, but not in autophagydeficient DU-145 cells. LCA (>10 mu M) increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) e concentration-depend ntly in PC-3 cells, whereas ROS levels were not affected in DU 145 cells. Solubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2 alpha dephosphorylation and ER stress, reduced LCA-induced CHOP levels slightly in PC-3, but not DU-145 cells. Salubrinal pretreatment increased the cyt toxicity ofLCA in PC-3 and DU-145 cells and resulted in a statistically significant loss of viability at normally non-toxic concentrations of LCA. The late-stage autophagy inhibitor bafilomyciu Al exacerbated LCA toxicity at subtoxic LCA concentrations in PC-3 cells. The antioxidant alpha-tocotrienol strongly inhibited the toxicity of LCA in PC-3 cells, but not in DU-145 cells. Collectively, although LCA induces autophagy and ER stress in PC-3 cells, these processes app ear to beinitially of protective nature and subsequently consequential to, but not critical for the ROSmediated mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity of LCA. The full mechanism of LCA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction DU-145 cells remains to be elucidated.	[Gafar, Ahmed A.; Draz, Hossam M.; Goldberg, Alexander A.; Sanderson, J.

There has been a longstanding controversy over whether it is possible to understand others' intentions by simply observing their movements. Here, we show that indeed movement kinematics can form the basis for intention detection. By combining kinematics and psychophysical methods with classification and regression tree (CART) modeling, we found that observers utilized a subset of discriminant kinematic features over the total kinematic pattern in order to detect intention from observation of simple motor acts. Intention discriminability covaried with movement kinematics on a trial-by-trial basis, and was directly related to the expression of discriminative features in the observed movements. These findings demonstrate a definable and measurable relationship between the specific features of observed movements and the ability to discriminate intention, providing quantitative evidence of the significance of movement kinematics for anticipating others' intentional actions.

Here, we propose a novel method for graphlet-based analysis of directed networks by computing first the signature vector for every vertex in the network and then the graphlet correlation matrix of the network. This analysis has been applied to brain effective connectivity networks by considering both direction and sign (inhibitory or excitatory) of the underlying directed (effective) connectivity. In particular, the signature vectors for brain regions and the graphlet correlation matrices of the brain effective network are computed for 40 healthy subjects and common dependencies are revealed. We found that the signature vectors (node, wedge, and triangle degrees) are dominant for the excitatory effective brain networks. Moreover, by considering only those correlations (or anti correlations) in the correlation matrix that are significant (>0.7 or <-0.7) and are presented in more than 60% of the subjects, we found that excitatory effective brain networks show stronger causal (measured with Granger causality) patterns (G-causes and G-effects) than inhibitory effective brain networks.

Decrease of Syngap1 in mice has been previously shown to cause cognitive deficits at least in part by inducing alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission and premature maturation of excitatory connections. Whether Syngap1 plays a role in the development of cortical GABAergic connectivity and function remains unclear. Here, we show that Syngap1 haploinsufficiency significantly reduces the formation of perisomatic innervations by parvalbumin-positive basket cells, a major population of GABAergic neurons, in a cell-autonomous manner. We further show that Syngap1 haploinsufficiency in GABAergic cells derived from the medial ganglionic eminence impairs their connectivity, reduces inhibitory synaptic activity and cortical gamma oscillation power, and causes cognitive deficits. Our results indicate that Syngap1 plays a critical role in GABAergic circuit function and further suggest that Syngap1 haploinsufficiency in GABAergic circuits may contribute to cognitive deficits.

Ankyrin-3 as a molecular marker of early-life stress and vulnerability to psychiatric disorders	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							CONVERGENT FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS; DNA METHYLATION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY; PRENATAL STRESS; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS; ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT	Exposure to early-life stress (ELS) may heighten the risk for psychopathology at adulthood. Here, in order to identify common genes that may keep the memory of ELS through changes in their methylation status, we intersected methylome analyses performed in different tissues and time points in rats, non-human primates and humans, all characterized by ELS. We identified Ankyrin-3 (Ank3), a scaffolding protein with a strong genetic association for psychiatric disorders, as a gene persistently affected by stress exposure. In rats, Ank3 methylation and mRNA changes displayed a specific temporal profile during the postnatal development. Moreover, exposure to prenatal stress altered the interaction of ankyrin-G, the protein encoded by Ank3 enriched in the post-synaptic compartment, with PSD95. Notably, to model in humans a gene by early stress interplay on brain phenotypes during cognitive performance, we demonstrated an interaction between functional variation in Ank3 gene and obstetric complications on working memory in healthy adult subjects. Our data suggest that alterations of Ank3 expression and function may contribute to the effects of ELS on the development of psychiatric disorders.	[Luoni, A.; Riva, M.

J	Mechawar, N; Savitz, J				Mechawar, N.; Savitz, J.			Neuropathology of mood disorders: do we see the stigmata of inflammation?	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review							MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; VESICULAR GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER; DECARBOXYLASE-67 MESSENGER-RNA; TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; EXCITOTOXIN QUINOLINIC ACID	A proportion of cases with mood disorders have elevated inflammatory markers in the blood that conceivably may result from stress, infection and/or autoimmunity. However, it is not yet clear whether depression is a neuroinflammatory disease. Multiple histopathological and molecular abnormalities have been found postmortem but the etiology of these abnormalities is unknown. Here, we take an immunological perspective of this literature. Increases in activated microglia or perivascular macrophages in suicide victims have been reported in the parenchyma. In contrast, astrocytic markers generally are downregulated in mood disorders. Impairment of astrocytic function likely compromises the reuptake of glutamate potentially leading to excitotoxicity. Inflammatory cytokines and microglia/macrophage-derived quinolinic acid (QA) downregulate the excitatory amino acid transporters responsible for this reuptake, while QA has the additional effect of inhibiting astroglial glutamine synthetase, which converts glutamate to glutamine. Given that oligodendroglia are particularly vulnerable to inflammation, it is noteworthy that reductions in numbers or density of oligodendrocyte cells are one of the most prominent findings in depression. Structural and/or functional changes to GABAergic interneurons also are salient in postmortem brain samples, and may conceivably be related to early inflammatory insults. Although the postmortem data are consistent with a neuroimmune etiology in a subgroup of depressed individuals, we do not argue that all depression-associated abnormalities are reflective of a neuroinflammatory process or even that all immunological activity in the brain is deleterious. Rather, we highlight the pervasive role of immune signaling pathways in brain function and provide an alternative perspective on the current postmortem literature.

Artificial grammar learning paradigms explore pattern recognition abilities in a set of structured sequences (i.e., of syllables or letters). In the present study, we investigated the functional underpinnings of learning phonological regularities in auditorily presented syllable sequences. While previous neuroimaging studies either focused on functional differences between the processing of correct vs. incorrect sequences or between different levels of sequence complexity, here the focus is on the neural foundation of the actual learning success. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants were exposed to a set of syllable sequences with an underlying phonological rule system, known to ensure performance differences between participants. We expected that successful learning and rule application would require phonological segmentation and phoneme comparison. As an outcome of four alternating learning and test fMRI sessions, participants split into successful learners and non-learners. Relative to non-learners, successful learners showed increased task-related activity in a fronto-parietal network of brain areas encompassing the left lateral premotor cortex as well as bilateral superior and inferior parietal cortices during both learning and rule application. These areas were previously associated with phonological segmentation, phoneme comparison, and verbal working memory. Based on these activity patterns and the phonological strategies for rule acquisition and application, we argue that successful learning and processing of complex phonological rules in our paradigm is mediated via a fronto-parietal network for phonological processes.

Only more recently, scientists have developed innovative strategies to understand to what extent vision is truly a mandatory prerequisite for the brain's fine morphological architecture to develop and function. As a whole, the studies conducted to date in sighted and congenitally blind individuals have provided ample evidence that several "visual" cortical areas develop independently from visual experience and do process information content regardless of the sensory modality through which a particular stimulus is conveyed: a property named supramodality. At the same time, lack of vision leads to a structural and functional reorganization within "visual" brain areas, a phenomenon known as cross-modal plasticity. Cross-modal recruitment of the occipital cortex in visually deprived individuals represents an adaptative compensatory mechanism that mediates processing of non-visual inputs. Supramodality and cross-modal plasticity appears to be the "yin and yang" of brain development: supramodal is what takes place despite the lack of vision, whereas cross-modal is what happens because of lack of vision. Here we provide a critical overview of the research in this field and discuss the implications that these novel findings have for the development of educative/rehabilitation approaches and sensory substitution devices (SSDs) in sensory-impaired individuals.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by both atypical interests and altered social interaction. We investigated whether MD is lower in adults with ASD compared to typically developed adults and whether MD correlates with social anhedonia and social judgment, two aspects of atypical social functioning in autism. Contrary to our hypotheses, MD was similarly present in both ASD and control groups. Anhedonia and social judgment differed between the ASD and control groups but did not correlate with MD. These results extend previous findings by suggesting that basic mechanisms of social influence are preserved in autism. The finding of intact MD in ASD stands against the intuitive idea that atypical interests stem from reduced social influence and indirectly favors the possibility that special interests might be selected for their intrinsic properties.

RNF213 Is Associated with Intracranial Aneurysms in the French-Canadian Population	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MICE LACKING RNF213; MAJOR ARTERY STENOSIS/OCCLUSION; DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY GENE; BURROWS-WHEELER TRANSFORM; MOYAMOYA-DISEASE; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; R4810K RS112735431; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; NATURAL-HISTORY	Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are the result of focal weakness in the artery wall and have a complex genetic makeup. To date, genome-wide association and sequencing studies have had limited success in identifying IA risk factors. Distinct populations, such as the French-Canadian (FC) population, have increased IA prevalence. In our study, we used exome sequencing to prioritize risk variants in a discovery cohort of six FC families affected by IA, and the analysis revealed an increased variation burden for ring finger protein 213 (RNF213). We resequenced RNF213 in a larger FC validation cohort, and association tests on further identified variants supported our findings (SKAT-O, p = 0.006). RNF213 belongs to the AAA+ protein family, and two variants (p.Arg2438Cys and p.Ala2826Thr) unique to affected FC individuals were found to have increased ATPase activity, which could lead to increased risk of IA by elevating angiogenic activities. Common SNPs in RNF213 were also extracted from the NeuroX SNP-chip genotype data, comprising 257 FC IA-affected and 1,988 control individuals. We discovered that the non-ancestral allele of rs6565666 was significantly associated with the affected individuals (p = 0.03), and it appeared as though the frequency of the risk allele had changed through genetic drift. Although RNF213 is a risk factor for moyamoya disease in East Asians, we demonstrated that it might also be a risk factor for IA in the FC population. It therefore appears that the function of RNF213 can be differently altered to predispose distinct populations to dissimilar neurovascular conditions, highlighting the importance of a population's background in genetic studies of heterogeneous disease.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) provide structural and functional information. Clinical MRI is both generally available and versatile - T2-weighted images show infarcts, FLAIR shows white matter changes and lacunar infarcts, and susceptibility-weighted images reveal microbleeds. Diffusion MRI adds another dimension by showing graded damage to white matter, making it more sensitive to white matter injury than FLAIR. Regions of neuroinflammatory disruption of the blood-brain barrier with increased permeability can be quantified and visualized with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. PET shows metabolism of glucose and accumulation of amyloid and tau, which is useful in showing abnormal metabolism in Alzheimer's disease. Combining MRI and PET allows identification of patients with mixed dementia, with MRI showing white matter injury and PET demonstrating regional impairment of glucose metabolism and deposition of amyloid. Excellent anatomical detail can be observed with 7.0-Tesla MRI. Imaging is the optimal method to follow the effect of treatments since changes in MRI scans are seen prior to those in cognition.

BOLD Imaging in Awake Wild-Type and Mu-Opioid Receptor Knock-Out Mice Reveals On-Target Activation Maps in Response to Oxycodone	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						oxycodone; opioid receptors; mu-opioid receptor; knockout mouse; addiction; target activation map; BOLD imaging; BOLD fMRI	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SPIN-ECHO FMRI; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; RAT-BRAIN; QUANTITATIVE AUTORADIOGRAPHY; PHARMACOLOGICAL MRI; CONSCIOUS RATS; RHESUS-MONKEYS	Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) imaging in awake mice was used to identify differences in brain activity between wild-type, and Mu (mu) opioid receptor knock-outs (MuKO) in response to oxycodone (OXY). Using a segmented, annotated MRI mouse atlas and computational analysis, patterns of integrated positive and negative BOLD activity were identified across 122 brain areas. The pattern of positive BOLD showed enhanced activation across the brain in WT mice within 15 min of intraperitoneal administration of 2.5 mg of OW BOLD activation was detected in 72 regions out of 122, and was most prominent in areas of high mu opioid receptor density (thalamus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, caudate putamen, basal amygdala, and hypothalamus), and focus on pain circuits indicated strong activation in major pain processing centers (central amygdala, solitary tract, parabrachial area, insular cortex, gigantocellularis area, ventral thalamus primary sensory cortex, and prelimbic cortex). Importantly, the OXY-induced positive BOLD was eliminated in MuKO mice in most regions, with few exceptions (some cerebellar nuclei. CA3 of the hippocampus, medial amygdala, and preoptic areas). This result indicates that most effects of OXY on positive BOLD are mediated by the mu opioid receptor (on-target effects). OXY also caused an increase in negative BOLD in WT mice in few regions (16 out of 122) and, unlike the positive BOLD response the negative BOLD was only partially eliminated in the MuKO mice (cerebellum), and in some case intensified (hippocampus). Negative BOLD analysis therefore shows activation and deactivation events in the absence of the mu receptor for some areas where receptor expression is normally extremely low or absent (off-target effects). Together, our approach permits establishing opioid induced BOLD activation maps in awake mice. In addition, comparison of WT and MuKO mutant mice reveals both on-target and off-target activation events, and set an OXY brain signature that should, in the future, be compared to other mu opioid agonists.

However, it has remained unclear how short-term network dynamics support the rapid transformation of instructions into fluent behaviour. Comparing fMRI data of a learning sample (N = 70) with a control sample (N = 67), we find that increasingly efficient task processing during short-term practice is associated with a reorganization of large-scale network interactions. Practice-related efficiency gains are facilitated by enhanced coupling between the cingulo-opercular network and the dorsal attention network. Simultaneously, short-term task automatization is accompanied by decreasing activation of the fronto-parietal network, indicating a release of high-level cognitive control, and a segregation of the default mode network from task-related networks. These findings suggest that short-term task automatization is enabled by the brain's ability to rapidly reconfigure its large-scale network organization involving complementary integration and segregation processes.

This study evaluated brain activation during performance of a working memory task (WMT) and an episodic memory task (EMT), and the effect of AQW051 on task-related brain activation and performance in subjects with schizophrenia. Methods: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 2-period cross-over trial (NCT00825539) in participants with chronic, stable schizophrenia. Participants, stratified according to smoking status, were randomized (1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1) to 1 of 6 sequence groups that determined the study drug dose (AQW051 7.5 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg) and order of administration versus placebo. The primary outcome was brain activation in a priori target regions of interest (ROIs) during performance of the WMT and EMT, measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The effect of AQW051 on task-related (EMT and WMT) brain activation and performance was also assessed, as were safety and tolerability. Results: Overall, 60 of 68 enrolled participants completed the study (AQW051 then placebo: 7.5 mg n = 9; 50 mg n = 11; 100 mg n = 10. Placebo then AQW051: 7.5 mg n = 10; 50 mg n = 11; 100 mg n = 9). Significant task-related brain activation (5% significance level) was observed with placebo. During the WMT, a medium effect size was observed in the inferior prefrontal cortex with AQW051 100 mg versus placebo (0.431; p = 0.105). During the EMT encoding phase, a large effect size was observed in the anterior hippocampus (0.795; p = 0.007) and a medium effect size in the posterior hippocampus (0.476; p = 0.079) with AQW051 7.5 mg. No other medium/large effect sizes were observed with any dose on either task. Effects on brain activation were generally not associated with changes in cognitive performance. AQW051 was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Conclusions: Overall, no consistent effects of AQW051 on brain regions involved in the performance of aWMT or EMT were observed; however, this study presents a model for evaluating potential response to pharmacological interventions for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.

We used a flanker task to elicit the ERN in 28 youth and young adults (8-26 years old) with primary diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 35 healthy controls. Patients were assessed before and after treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and healthy controls were assessed at a comparable interval. The ERN increased across assessments in the combined sample. Patients with SAD exhibited an enhanced ERN relative to healthy controls prior to and following treatment, even when analyses were limited to SAD patients who responded to treatment. Patients with GAD did not significantly differ from healthy controls at either assessment. Results provide preliminary evidence that enhanced error monitoring persists following treatment for SAD in youth and young adults, and support conceptualizations of increased error monitoring as a trait-like vulnerability that may contribute to risk for recurrence and impaired functioning later in life. Future work is needed to further evaluate the ERN in GAD across development, including whether an enhanced ERN develops in adulthood or is most apparent when worries focus on internal sources of threat.

Transient Developmental Purkinje Cell Axonal Torpedoes in Healthy and Ataxic Mouse Cerebellum	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						axon; pruning; microglia; synapse; myelin; neurofilament; ataxia; axonal swelling	ESSENTIAL TREMOR; RAT CEREBELLUM; WHITE-MATTER; ADULT-RAT; SWELLINGS; INTERNEURONS; EXPRESSION; SYNAPSES; EXPOSURE; CORTEX	Information is carried out of the cerebellar cortical microcircuit via action potentials propagated along Purkinje cell axons. In several human neurodegenerative diseases, focal axonal swellings on Purkinje cells - known as torpedoes - have been associated with Purkinje cell loss. Interestingly, torpedoes are also reported to appear transiently during development in rat cerebellum. The function of Purkinje cell axonal torpedoes in health as well as in disease is poorly understood. We investigated the properties of developmental torpedoes in the postnatal mouse cerebellum of wild-type and transgenic mice. We found that Purkinje cell axonal torpedoes transiently appeared on axons of Purkinje neurons, with the largest number of torpedoes observed at postnatal day 11 (P11). This was after peak developmental apoptosis had occurred, when Purkinje cell counts in a lobule were static, suggesting that most developmental torpedoes appear on axons of neurons that persist into adulthood. We found that developmental torpedoes were not associated with a presynaptic GABAergic marker, indicating that they are not synapses. They were seldom found at axonal collateral branch points, and lacked microglia enrichment, suggesting that they are unlikely to be involved in axonal refinement. Interestingly, we found several differences between developmental torpedoes and disease-related torpedoes: developmental torpedoes occurred largely on myelinated axons, and were not associated with changes in basket cell innervation on their parent soma. Disease-related torpedoes are typically reported to contain neurofilament; while the majority of developmental torpedoes did as well, a fraction of smaller developmental torpedoes did not. These differences indicate that developmental torpedoes may not be functionally identical to disease-related torpedoes. To study this further, we used a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), and found elevated disease-related torpedo number at 2 years. However, we found normal levels of developmental torpedoes in these mice. Our findings suggest that the transient emergence of Purkinje cell axonal torpedoes during the second postnatal week in mice represents a normal morphological feature in the developing cerebellar microcircuit.

Compromised oocyte quality and assisted reproduction contribute to sex-specific effects on offspring outcomes and epigenetic patterning	HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS			English	Article							BECKWITH-WIEDEMANN-SYNDROME; INHERITED GENOMIC IMPRINTS; DNA METHYLATION; PREIMPLANTATION DEVELOPMENT; MOUSE DEVELOPMENT; IN-VITRO; EXPRESSION; GENE; MICE; METHYLTRANSFERASE	Clinical studies have revealed an increased incidence of growth and genomic imprinting disorders in children conceived using assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), and aberrant DNA methylation has been implicated. We propose that compromised oocyte quality associated with female infertility may make embryos more susceptible to the induction of epigenetic defects by ART. DNA methylation patterns in the preimplantation embryo are dependent on the oocyte-specific DNA methyltransferase 1o (DNMT1o), levels of which are decreased in mature oocytes of aging females. Here, we assessed the effects of maternal deficiency in DNMT1o (Dnmt1(Delta 1o/+)) in combination with superovulation and embryo transfer on offspring DNA methylation and development. We demonstrated a significant increase in the rates of morphological abnormalities in offspring collected from Dnmt1(Delta 1o/+) females only when combined with ART. Together, maternal oocyte DNMT1o deficiency and ART resulted in an accentuation of placental imprinting defects and the induction of genome-wide DNA methylation alterations, which were exacerbated in the placenta compared to the embryo. Significant sex-specific trends were also apparent, with a preponderance of DNA hypomethylation in females. Among genic regions affected, a significant enrichment for neurodevelopmental pathways was observed. Taken together, our results demonstrate that oocyte DNMT1o-deficiency exacerbates genome-wide DNA methylation abnormalities induced by ART in a sex-specific manner and plays a role in mediating poor embryonic outcome.

It is often suggested that they occur independently of inflammation. Here we investigated the disease progression in mouse models carrying PLP1 point mutations previously found in patients displaying clinical features of multiple sclerosis. These mouse models show loss-of-function of PLP1 associated with neuroinflammation; the latter leading to clinically relevant axonal degeneration, neuronal loss and brain atrophy as demonstrated by inactivation of the recombination activating gene 1. Moreover, these pathological hallmarks were substantially amplified when we attenuated immune regulation by inactivation of the programmed cell death-1 gene. Our observations support the view that primary oligodendroglial abnormalities can evoke pathogenically relevant neuroinflammation that drives neurodegeneration, as observed in some forms of multiple sclerosis but also in other, genetically-mediated neurodegenerative disorders of the human nervous system. As many potent immunomodulatory drugs have emerged during the last years, it is tempting to consider immunomodulation as a treatment option not only for multiple sclerosis, but also for so far non-treatable, genetically-mediated disorders of the nervous system accompanied by pathogenic neuroinflammation.

Moreover, potential deleterious effects of the CHG(BP413L) variant in ALS pathology have not been investigated. Here we report that in transfected cultured cells, the variant CHGB(L413) protein exhibited aberrant properties including mislocalization, failure to interact with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and defective secretion. The CHGB(L413) transgene in SOD1(G37R) mice precipitated disease onset and pathological changes related to misfolded SOD1 specifically in female mice. However, the CHGB(L413) variant also slowed down disease progression in SOD1(G37R) mice, which is in line with a very slow disease progression that we report for a Swedish woman with ALS who is carrier of two mutant SOD1(D90A) alleles and two variant CHGB(P413)L and CHGB(R458Q) alleles. In contrast, overexpression of the common CHGB(P413) allele in SOD1(G37R) mice did not affect disease onset but significantly accelerated disease progression and pathological changes. As in transgenic mice, the CHGB(P413L) allele conferred an earlier ALS disease onset in women of Japanese and French Canadian origins with less effect in men. Evidence is presented that the sex-dependent effects of CHGB(L413) allelic variant in ALS may arise from enhanced neuronal expression of CHGB in females because of a sex-determining region Y element in the gene promoter. Thus, our results suggest that CHGB variants may act as modifiers of onset and progression in some ALS populations and especially in females because of higher expression levels compared to males.

However, evidence for PKMz in the maintenance of pain hypersensitivity comes exclusively from short-term studies in males using pharmacological agents of questionable selectivity. The present study examines the contribution of PKMz to long-lasting allodynia associated with neuropathic, inflammatory, or referred visceral and muscle pain in males and females using pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation. Results: Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of PKMz reduced mild formalin pain and slowly developing contralateral allodynia in nerve-injured rats, but not moderate formalin pain or ipsilateral allodynia in models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of PKMz also effectively reduced referred visceral and muscle pain in male, but not in female mice and rats. Conclusion: We show pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation of PKMz consistently attenuate long-lasting pain hypersensitivity. However, differential effects in models of referred versus inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and in males versus females, highlight the roles of afferent input-dependent masking and sex differences in the maintenance of pain hypersensitivity.

An immunohistochemical analysis of cellular origin may yield valuable insights into disease progression and treatment options. This study aimed to determine the cellular origin of retinoblastoma in a large case series and correlate these findings with histopathological prognostic factors. Methods: Thirty-nine retinoblastoma cases were histopathologically diagnosed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against the immature neural cell marker SRY-box containing gene 2 (SOX-2), the mature neuronal cell marker microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and the mature glial cell marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Histopathological features were also evaluated, including patterns of growth, differentiation, vitreous see-ding, and choroidal/scleral, optic nerve, and anterior chamber invasion. Two retinoblastoma cell lines, WERI-1 and Y79, were studied by immunocytochemistry using the same antibodies. Results: Expression of SOX-2 was strong in 97.4% of retinoblastoma cases, while MAP-2 was expressed in 59% of cases. Immunostaining for GFAP was positive only in reactive stromal astrocytes interspersed amongst tumor cells and in peritumoral tissue. There was no correlation between histopathological prognostic factors and immunohistochemical markers. Retinoblastoma cell lines showed strong positivity for SOX2 (90% of WERI-1 cells and 70% of Y79 cells) and MAP2 (90% of cells in both lines). GFAP was completely negative in both cell lines. Conclusion: The majority of retinoblastomas and both RB cell lines expressed an immature neural and/or a mature neuronal cell marker, but not a glial marker. These results indicate a typical neuroblast or neuronal origin and eliminate astrocyte differentiation from neural stem cells as the source of retinoblastoma.

However, no thorough interventions to prevent chronic pain development in ET patients have yet been proposed. Objectives: This first part of a series of two articles aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of literature on the epidemiology of pain post-ET, the impact of persistent pain on ET patients and the relevant biological transformations involved in acute to chronic pain transition. The second article will focus on risk and protective factors relating to chronic pain that could potentially assist in the development of preventive interventions. Methods: A narrative review of the literature was undertaken. Databases were searched to identify relevant studies and seminal works on the topics of interest. Results: The review revealed that acute pain converts to chronic pain in up to 86% of ET patients. Analysis of study findings also indicated that chronic pain interferes with activities of daily living and capacity to work. Weak associations between chronic pain and anxiety as well as depression have been demonstrated. Anxiety and depression have been identified as important predictors of chronic pain post-ET. Neuroimmunological transformations, genetics and an emotional shift in the brain circuitry involved in nociception have been shown to contribute to the transition towards chronic pain. Conclusions: This narrative review supports the view that acute to chronic pain transition is a prevalent and significant issue post-ET. It also provides information about patients who present a higher risk of chronic pain and features that should be integrated in preventive interventions as well as methodological considerations pertaining to the evaluation of such interventions.

Vagal stimulation targets select populations of intrinsic cardiac neurons to control neurally induced atrial fibrillation	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						atrial arrhythmias; intrinsic cardiac nervous system; local circuit neurons; memory; stochastic neuronal interactivity; vagus	VAGUS NERVE-STIMULATION; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; HEART-RATE; PARASYMPATHETIC CONTROL; NETWORK INTERACTIONS; GANGLIONATED PLEXUS; CATHETER ABLATION; CORD NEURONS; SYSTEM; ARRHYTHMIAS	Mediastinal nerve stimulation (MNS) reproducibly evokes atrial fibrillation (AF) by excessive and heterogeneous activation of intrinsic cardiac (IC) neurons. This study evaluated whether preemptive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) impacts MNS-induced evoked changes in IC neural network activity to thereby alter susceptibility to AF. IC neuronal activity in the right atrial ganglionated plexus was directly recorded in anesthetized canines (n = 8) using a linear microelectrode array concomitant with right atrial electrical activity in response to: 1) epicardial touch or great vessel occlusion vs. 2) stellate or vagal stimulation. From these stressors, post hoc analysis (based on the Skellam distribution) defined IC neurons so recorded as afferent, efferent, or convergent (afferent and efferent inputs) local circuit neurons (LCN). The capacity of right-sided MNS to modify IC activity in the induction of AF was determined before and after preemptive right (RCV)-vs. left (LCV)sided VNS (15 Hz, 500 mu s; 1.2 x bradycardia threshold). Neuronal (n = 89) activity at baseline (0.11 +/- 0.29 Hz) increased during MNS-induced AF (0.51 +/- 1.30 Hz; P < 0.001). Convergent LCNs were preferentially activated by MNS. Preemptive RCV reduced MNS-induced changes in LCN activity (by 70%) while mitigating MNS-induced AF (by 75%). Preemptive LCV reduced LCN activity by 60% while mitigating AF potential by 40%. IC neuronal synchrony increased during neurally induced AF, a local neural network response mitigated by preemptive VNS. These antiarrhythmic effects persisted post-VNS for, on average, 26 min. In conclusion, VNS preferentially targets convergent LCNs and their interactive coherence to mitigate the potential for neurally induced AF. The antiarrhythmic properties imposed by VNS exhibit memory.

We have shown previously that endogenous stemcell potential is confined to ependymal cells in the adult spinal cord which could be targeted for non-invasive SCI therapy. However, ependymal cells are an understudied cell population. Taking advantage of transgenic lines, we characterize the appearance and potential of ependymal cells during development. We show that spinal cord stem cell potential in vitro is contained within these cells by birth. Moreover, juvenile cultures generate more neurospheres and more oligodendrocytes than adult ones. Interestingly, juvenile ependymal cells in vivo contribute to glial scar formation after severe but not mild SCI, due to a more effective sealing of the lesion by other glial cells. This study highlights the importance of the age-dependent potential of stem cells and post-SCI environment in order to utilize ependymal cell's regenerative potential. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Cognitive and Behavioral Functioning in Childhood Acquired Demyelinating Syndromes	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Demyelination; Cognition; Pediatric; Multiple sclerosis; Brain lesions; Magnetic resonance imaging	ACUTE DISSEMINATED ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; PEDIATRIC MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; CLINICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROMES; FOLLOW-UP; PSYCHOSOCIAL FEATURES; NEUROMYELITIS-OPTICA; JUVENILE MS; CHILDREN; AGE; ONSET	Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe cognitive, academic, and psychosocial outcomes after an incident demyelinating event (acquired demyelinating syndromes, ADS) in childhood and to investigate the contribution of brain lesions and confirmed MS diagnosis on outcome. Methods: Thirty-six patients with ADS (mean age=12.2 years, SD=2.7, range: 7-16 years) underwent brain MRI scans at presentation and at 6-months follow-up. T-2-weighted lesions on MRI were assessed using a binary classification. At 6-months follow-up, patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation and were compared with 42 healthy controls. Results: Cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes did not differ between the patients with ADS and controls. Three of 36 patients (8.3%) were identified with cognitive impairment, as determined by performance falling <= 1.5 SD below normative values on more than four independent tests in the battery. Poor performance on a visuomotor integration task was most common, observed among 6/32 patients, but this did not differ significantly from controls. Twelve of 36 patients received a diagnosis of MS within 3 years post-ADS. Patients with MS did not differ from children with monophasic ADS in terms of cognitive performance at the 6-months follow-up. Fatigue symptoms were reported in 50% of patients, irrespective of MS diagnosis. Presence of brain lesions at onset and 6 months post-incident demyelinating event did not associate with cognitive outcome. Conclusions: Children with ADS experience a favorable short-term neurocognitive outcome, even those confirmed to have MS. Longitudinal evaluations of children with monophasic ADS and MS are required to determine the possibility of late-emerging sequelae and their time course.

Objective: Our aim was to use a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage 24 h after head trauma in patients who have a normal initial brain computed tomography (CT) scan but took vitamin K antagonist before injury. Methods: EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane Library were searched using controlled vocabulary and keywords. Retrospective and prospective observational studies were included. Outcomes included positive CT scan 24 h post-trauma, need for surgical intervention, or death. Pooled risk was estimated with logit proportion in a random effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Seven publications were identified encompassing 1,594 patients that were rescanned after a normal first head scan. For these patients, the pooled estimate of the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage on the second CT scan 24 h later was 0.60% (95% CI 0-1.2%) and the resulting risk of neurosurgical intervention or death was 0.13% (95% CI 0.02-0.45%). Conclusions: The present study is the first published meta-analysis estimating the risk of delayed intracranial hemorrhage 24 h after head trauma in patients anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonist and normal initial CT scan. In most situations, a repeat CT scan in the emergency department 24 h later is not necessary if the first CT scan is normal. Special care may be required for patients with serious mechanism of injury, patients showing signs of neurologic deterioration, and patients presenting with excessive anticoagulation or receiving antiplatelet co-medication.

Bimanual Psychomotor Performance in Neurosurgical Resident Applicants Assessed Using NeuroTouch, a Virtual Reality Simulator	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						medical student neurosurgical applicants; interview; NeuroTouch/NeuroVR; virtual reality simulator; bimanual psychomotor performance; technical abilities customized training (TACT)	ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY; SURGICAL EDUCATION; BARIATRIC-SURGERY; MCGILL SIMULATOR; DEXTERITY; PREDICT; SKILLS	OBJECTIVE: Current selection methods for neurosurgical residents fail to include objective measurements of bimanual psychomotor performance. Advancements in computer based simulation provide opportunities to assess cognitive and psychomotor skills in surgically naive populations during complex simulated neurosurgical tasks in risk-free environments. This pilot study was designed to answer 3 questions: (1) What are the differences in bimanual psychomotor performance among neurosurgical residency applicants using NeuroTouch? (2) Are there exceptionally skilled medical students in the applicant cohort? and (3) Is there an influence of previous surgical exposure on surgical performance? DESIGN: Participants were instructed to remove 3 simulated brain tumors with identical visual appearance, stiffness, and random bleeding points. Validated tier 1, tier 2, and advanced tier 2 metrics were used to assess bimanual psychomotor performance. Demographic data included weeks of neurosurgical elective and prior operative exposure. SETTING: This pilot study was carried out at the McGill Neurosurgical Simulation Research and Training Center immediately following neurosurgical residency interviews at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: All 17 medical students interviewed were asked to participate, of which 16 agreed. RESULTS: Performances were clustered in definable top, middle, and bottom groups with significant differences for all metrics. Increased time spent playing music, increased applicant self-evaluated technical skills, high self-ratings of confidence, and increased skin closures statistically influenced performance on univariate analysis. A trend for both self-rated increased operating room confidence and increased weeks of neurosurgical exposure to increased blood loss was seen in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation technology identifies neurosurgical residency applicants with differing levels of technical ability. These results provide information for studies being developed for longitudinal studies on the acquisition, development, and maintenance of psychomotor skills. Technical abilities customized training programs that maximize individual resident bimanual psychomotor training dependant on continuously updated and validated metrics from virtual reality simulation studies should be explored.

Acute cell swelling activates a regulatory volume decrease (RVD) process with poorly defined volume sensing and intermediate signaling mechanisms. Here, we analyzed the putative role of Ca2+ signaling in RVD in single substrate-adherent human lung epithelial A549 cells. Acute cell swelling was induced by perfusion of the flow-through imaging chamber with 50 % hypotonic solution at a defined fluid turnover rate. Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) and cell volume were monitored simultaneously with ratiometric Fura-2 fluorescence and 3D reconstruction of stereoscopic single-cell images, respectively. Hypotonic challenge caused a progressive swelling peaking at similar to 20 min and followed, during the next 20 min, by RVD of 60 +/- 7 % of the peak volume increase. However, at the rate of swelling used in our experiments, these processes were not accompanied by a measurable increment of [Ca2+](i). Loading with intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA slightly delayed peak of swelling but did not prevent RVD in 82 % of cells. Further, electrophysiology whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that BAPTA did not block activation of volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) measured as swelling-induced outwardly rectifying 5-nitro-2-(3phenylpropyl-amino) benzoic acid sensitive current. Together, our data suggest that intracellular Ca2+-mediated signaling is not essential for VRAC activation and subsequent volume restoration in A549 cells.

This is surprising considering recent reports challenging the long-held belief that the BDNFMet variant negatively impacts cognitive function. A total of 75 young healthy adults (26 of them carried at least one copy of the BDNFMet allele) took part in this study consisting of genetic profiling from saliva, personality assessment using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R) and a short battery of neuropsychological tests. An ANOVA revealed that BDNFMet carriers were significantly less extraverted than BDNFVal carriers (F-1,F-73 = 9.54; p < 0.01; eta(2)(p) = 0.126). Moreover, extraversion was found to significantly moderate the relationship between the BDNF genotype and episodic memory performance (p = 0.03). Subsequent correlational analyses yielded a strong and significant correlation (r = 0.542; p < 0.005) between introversion and delayed episodic memory specific to BDNFMet individuals. The present study suggests that introversion and the BDNFMet variant synergistically interact to reduce episodic memory performance in healthy, young adults. These findings reaffirm that a more accurate explanation of cognitive variance can be achieved by looking at the synergistic effects of genotype and phenotype factors.

It is indeed used as a pharmacological model of psychosis in preclinical research. The goal of this review was to understand the mechanism of action of psychotic-like effects of LSD. We searched Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and articles' reference lists for preclinical studies regarding the mechanism of action involved in the psychotic-like effects induced by LSD. LSD's mechanism of action is pleiotropic, primarily mediated by the serotonergic system in the Dorsal Raphe, binding the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist and 5-HT1A as an agonist. LSD also modulates the Ventral Tegmental Area, at higher doses, by stimulating dopamine D-2, Trace Amine Associate receptor 1 (TAAR(1)) and 5-HT2A. More studies clarifying the mechanism of action of the psychotic-like symptoms or psychosis induced by LSD in humans are needed. LSD's effects are mediated by a pleiotropic mechanism involving serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Thus, the LSD-induced psychosis is a useful model to test the therapeutic efficacy of potential novel antipsychotic drugs, particularly drugs with dual serotonergic and dopaminergic (DA) mechanism or acting on TAAR(1) receptors.

Methods: Twenty-four-channel shim and 8-channel transceiver arrays were designed to insert into the patient bed table to lie in close proximity to the subject's spine. The reference field patterns of each of the shim channels (Hz/A) were determined empirically via gradient echo field mapping and subsequently used to demonstrate shim performance at 3 Tesla using an ex vivo phantom, which incorporated a fixed human spine. The shim was further demonstrated on five healthy volunteers. Results: Application of the shim to the ex vivo phantom reduced the standard deviation of the field over the spinal volume of interest (123.4 cm(3)) from an original 51.3 Hz down to 32.5 Hz, amounting to an improvement in field homogeneity of 36.6%. In vivo, the spine shim resulted in an average improvement in field homogeneity of 63.8+/-15.4%. Conclusion: The localized spine shim offers a promising new means of correcting magnetic field distortion in the spinal cord.

Focal clonic seizures, status epilepticus, and infantile spasms appeared later, during the first months of life, while erratic myoclonic jerks persisted. Electroencephalogram initially showed multifocal spikes that evolved into modified hypsarrhythmia and then discontinuous activity, evoking the progressive nature of the condition. Magnetic resonance imaging showed brain atrophy and poor myelination. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid asparagine levels were normal or moderately reduced on repeat testing. Both infants died at the age of 8 months in status epilepticus. Neuropathology of the brother revealed diffuse neuronal loss and astrocytic gliosis predominating in superficial layers of temporal and frontal lobes and in thalamus with almost absent myelin, as a consequence of the neuronal death. Whole exome sequencing of the siblings and parents revealed compound heterozygous c.1439C > T (p.Ser480Phe) and c.1648C > T (p.Arg550Cys) mutations in the ASNS gene, indicating asparagine synthetase (ASNS) deficiency. Electroclinical epileptic phenotype and neuropathological findings of ASNS deficiency are reminiscent of neonatal pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, thus suggesting common pathophysiological mechanism possibly related to cytotoxic glutamate accumulation.

Because a pial angioma may not be evident on the initial imaging studies, individuals at risk for epilepsy are often not identified before their first seizure. The aim of this study is to identify predictive factors predisposing Sturge Weber patients to epilepsy. METHODS: The medical archives and photography database of our institution were reviewed to identify Sturge Weber Syndrome patients followed up between 1990 and 2015. Patients without epilepsy were compared with patients with epilepsy based on the location of the port-wine stain, its extent and cerebral imaging. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included in the study. Thirteen did not develop epilepsy. Patients with bilateral port-wine stain were at higher risk of epilepsy (P = 0.03). Unilateral port-wine stain did not increase the risk of epilepsy (P = 0.29) regardless of its extent. The presence of developmental venous anomalies on brain imaging was also associated with a higher risk of epilepsy (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral facial port-wine stain and cerebral developmental venous anomalies increase the risk of epilepsy in Sturge Weber syndrome patients. Because they can be detected at birth, they might guide preventive management and follow-up.

To determine if these abnormalities could be identified in vivo, we investigated mGluR5 availability in 10 patients with focal epilepsy and an MRI diagnosis of FCD using positron-emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [C-11]ABP688. Partial volume corrected [C-11]ABP688 binding potentials (BPND) were computed using the cerebellum as a reference region. Each patient was compared to homotopic cortical regions in 33 healthy controls using region-of-interest (ROI) and vertex-wise analyses. Reduced [C-11]ABP688 BPND in the FCD was seen in 7/10 patients with combined ROI and vertex-wise analyses. Reduced FCD BPND was found in 4/5 operated patients (mean follow-up: 63 months; Engel I), of whom surgical specimens revealed FCD type IIb or IIa, with most balloon cells showing negative or weak mGluR5 immunoreactivity as compared to their respective neuropil and normal neurons at the border of resections. [C-11]ABP688 PET shows for the first time in vivo evidence of reduced mGluR5 availability in FCD, indicating focal glutamatergic alterations in malformations of cortical development, which cannot be otherwise clearly demonstrated through resected tissue analyses.

There is evidence that UGS increases with physical activity. Muscle function and body composition changes may mediate these changes. However, we do not know exactly which of these factors contribute to the effect of physical activity on gait speed or the magnitude of their contribution. Methods: Data are from 1378 women aged 75 years and older recruited in the Toulouse EPIDemiologie de l'OSteoporose cohort. Body weight and composit ion (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), knee extension strength, and physical activity habits were assessed. The INDIRECT macro for SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) was used to determine total and specific indirect effects of physical activity on UGS through body weight (BW) and composition as well as muscle mass and strength. Results: Knee extension strength [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0091, 0.0231] and BW (95% CI 0.0037, 0.0412), but not fat mass or muscle mass, were mediators of the relationship between physical activity and gait speed. However, muscle mass significantly mediated the relationship between physical activity and muscle strength (95% CI = 3.0722, = 0.6265). Conclusions: Results suggest that muscle strength and BW are the most significant mediators of the relationship between physical activity and UGS. Although the specific effect of muscle mass appears negligible at first sight, its role should not be overlooked given its impact on muscle strength.

Drug induced mitochondrial dysfunction may be a consequence of increased production of reactive oxygen species, altered mitochondrial permeability transition, impaired mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial DNA damage or inhibition of beta-oxidation of fatty acids. The clinical manifestation depends on the specific drug and its effect on mitochondria. Given the ubiquitous presence of mitochondria and its central role in cellular metabolism, drug-mitochondrial interactions may manifest clinically as hepatotoxicity, enteropathy, myelosuppression, lipodystrophy syndrome or neuropsychiatric adverse effects, to name a few. The current review focuses on specific drug groups which adversely affect mitochondria, the mechanisms involved and the clinical consequences based on the data available from experimental and clinical studies. Knowledge of these adverse drug-mitochondrial interactions may help the clinicians foresee potential issues in individual patients, prevent adverse drug reactions or alter drug regimens to enhance patient safety.

Little is known about its potential interactions with the dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using in-vivo electrophysiology in male adult rats, we evaluated the effects of cumulative doses of LSD on VTA DA neuronal activity, compared these effects to those produced on 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), and attempted to identify the mechanism of action mediating the effects of LSD on VTA DA neurons. LSD, at low doses (5-20 mu g/kg, i.v.) induced a significant decrease of DRN 5-HT firing activity through 5-HT2A and D-2 receptors. At these low doses, LSD did not alter VTA DA neuronal activity. On the contrary, at higher doses (30-120 mu g/kg, i.v.), LSD dose-dependently decreased VTA DA firing activity. The depletion of 5-HT with p-chlorophenylalanine did not modulate the effects of LSD on DA firing activity. The inhibitory effects of LSD on VTA DA firing activity were prevented by the D-2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (50 mu g/kg, i.v.) and by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100,635 (500 mu g/kg, i.v.). Notably, pretreatment with the trace amine-associate receptor I (TAAR(1)) antagonist EPPTB (5 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked the inhibitory effect of LSD on VTA DA neurons. These results suggest that LSD at high doses strongly affects DA mesolimbic neuronal activity in a 5-HT independent manner and with a pleiotropic mechanism of action involving 5-HT1A, D-2 and TAAR(1) receptors.

Reports of ZIKV-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome as well as fetal microcephaly place emphasis on the need to develop preventative measures and therapeutics to combat ZIKV infection. Thus, it is imperative that models to study ZIKV replication and pathogenesis and the immune response are developed in conjunction with integrated vector control strategies to mount an efficient response to the pandemic. This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge on ZIKV, including the clinical features, phylogenetic analyses, pathogenesis, and the immune response to infection. Potential challenges in developing diagnostic tools, treatment, and prevention strategies are also discussed.

Intragenic CNVs for Epigenetic Regulatory Genes in Intellectual Disability: Survey Identifies Pathogenic and Benign Single Exon Changes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A			English	Article						intellectual disability; epigenetics; JARID2; ARID4B; ARID2; KDM3A; intragenic CNVs; UBE2A; CHD7; CHD6; ARID1B; JMJDIC; MEF2C	EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; GENOMIC HYBRIDIZATION; JARID2; EXPRESSION; CHROMATIN; JUMONJI; ASSOCIATION; IFITM1; DIFFERENTIATION; INVOLVEMENT	The disruption of genes involved in epigenetic regulation is well known to cause Intellectual Disability (ID). We reported a custom microarray study that interrogated among others, the epigenetic regulatory gene-class, at single exon resolution. Here we elaborate on identified intragenic CNVs involving epigenetic regulatory genes; specifically discussing those in three genes previously unreported in ID etiology-ARID2, KDM3A, and ARID4B. The changes in ARID2 and KDM3A are likely pathogenic while the ARID4B variant is uncertain. Previously, we found a CNV involving only exon 6 of the JARID2 gene occurred apparently de novo in seven patients. JARID2 is known to cause ID and other neurodevelopmental conditions. However, exon 6 of this gene encodes one of a series of repeated motifs. We therefore, investigated the impact of this variant in two cohorts and present a genotype-phenotype assessment. We find the JARID2 exon 6 CNV is benign, with a high population frequency (>14%), but nevertheless could have a contributory effect. We also present results from an interrogation of the exomes of 2,044 patients with neurocognitive phenotypes for the incidence of potentially damaging mutation in the epigenetic regulatory gene-class. This paper provides a survey of the fine-scale CNV landscape for epigenetic regulatory genes in the context of ID, describing likely pathogenic as well as benign single exon imbalances.

MethodsFifteen secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients, 12 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, and 14 matched healthy controls underwent C-11-PBR28 MR-PET. MS subjects underwent 7T <mml:msubsup>T2*</mml:msubsup>-weighted imaging for cortical lesion segmentation, and neurological and cognitive evaluation. C-11-PBR28 binding was measured using normalized 60- to 90-minute standardized uptake values and volume of distribution ratios. ResultsRelative to controls, MS subjects exhibited abnormally high C-11-PBR28 binding across the brain, the greatest increases being in cortex and cortical lesions, thalamus, hippocampus, and NAWM. MS WM lesions showed relatively modest TSPO increases. With the exception of cortical lesions, where TSPO expression was similar, C-11-PBR28 uptake across the brain was greater in SPMS than in RRMS. In MS, increased C-11-PBR28 binding in cortex, deep GM, and NAWM correlated with neurological disability and impaired cognitive performance; cortical thinning correlated with increased thalamic TSPO levels. InterpretationIn MS, neuroinflammation is present in the cortex, cortical lesions, deep GM, and NAWM, is closely linked to poor clinical outcome, and is at least partly linked to neurodegeneration. Distinct inflammatory-mediated factors may underlie accumulation of cortical and WM lesions. Quantification of TSPO levels in MS could prove to be a sensitive tool for evaluating in vivo the inflammatory component of GM pathology, particularly in cortical lesions.

Adverse neuropsychological effects associated with cumulative doses of corticosteroids to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: A literature review	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY			English	Review						Childhood lymphoblastic leukemia; Corticosteroids; Emotion; Behaviour; Neurocognition; Fatigue	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; FARBER-CANCER-INSTITUTE; CONSORTIUM PROTOCOL 00-01; DANA-FARBER; NEUROCOGNITIVE OUTCOMES; BEHAVIORAL-PROBLEMS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; ADULT SURVIVORS; STANDARD-RISK; CHILDREN	Corticosteroids (CS) are an essential component of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatments (cALL). Although there is evidence that daily doses of CS can have neuropsychological effects, few studies have investigated the role of cumulative doses of CS in short- and long-term neuropsychological effects in cALL. The aims of this review were to identify the measures used for documenting adverse neuropsychological effects (ANEs) of CS treatment and to study the association between cumulative doses of CS and the presence of ANEs. Twenty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. A variety of measures were used to evaluate outcomes in the domains of emotion, behaviour, neurocognition, and fatigue/sleep. The results suggest that we cannot conclude in favour of an association between the cumulative dosage of CS and ANEs. Yet, several factors including the heterogeneity of measures used to evaluate outcomes and reporting biases may limit the scope of the results. We offer several recommendations that could help improve the future published evidence on ANEs in relation to CS treatment in CALL. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pepin, A.

Early selectivity for vocal and musical sounds: electrophysiological evidence from an adaptation paradigm	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERPs; music; neural adaptation; neural selectivity; speech prosody; voice	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEURAL ADAPTATION; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; WORDS; PERCEPTION; COMPONENT; LANGUAGE; FACES	There is growing interest in characterizing the neural basis of music perception and, in particular, assessing how similar, or not, it is to that of speech. To further explore this question, we employed an EEG adaptation paradigm in which we compared responses to short sounds belonging to the same category, either speech (pseudo-sentences) or music (piano or violin), depending on whether they were immediately preceded by a same- or different-category sound. We observed a larger reduction in the N100 component magnitude in response to musical sounds when they were preceded by music (either the same or different instrument) than by speech. In contrast, the N100 amplitude was not affected by the preceding stimulus category in the case of speech. For P200 component, we observed a diminution of amplitude when speech sounds were preceded speech, compared to music. No such decrease was found when we compared the responses to music sounds. These differences in the processing of speech and music are consistent with the proposal that some degree of category selectivity for these two classes of complex stimuli already occurs at early stages of auditory processing, possibly subserved by partly separated neuronal populations.

Vessel co-option mediates resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in liver metastases	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							BEVACIZUMAB PLUS CAPECITABINE; PHASE-III TRIAL; ANTIANGIOGENIC THERAPY; COLORECTAL-CANCER; BREAST-CANCER; TUMOR INVASION; FUTURE-DIRECTIONS; BRAIN METASTASIS; VEGF ANTIBODY; GROWTH	The efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer is limited by resistance mechanisms that are poorly understood. Notably, instead of through the induction of angiogenesis, tumor vascularization can occur through the nonangiogenic mechanism of vessel co-option. Here we show that vessel co-option is associated with a poor response to the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Moreover, we find that vessel co-option is also prevalent in human breast cancer liver metastases, a setting in which results with anti-angiogenic therapy have been disappointing. In preclinical mechanistic studies, we found that cancer cell motility mediated by the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) is required for vessel co-option in liver metastases in vivo and that, in this setting, combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option is more effective than the inhibition of angiogenesis alone. Vessel co-option is therefore a clinically relevant mechanism of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy and combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option might be a warranted therapeutic strategy.

Int Canc Genome Consortium	Recurrent MET fusion genes represent a drug target in pediatric glioblastoma	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							INTRINSIC PONTINE GLIOMA; LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA; HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA; GENOMIC LANDSCAPE; CANCER; MUTATIONS; REARRANGEMENT; INHIBITION; TRANSCRIPT; RESISTANCE	Pediatric glioblastoma is one of the most common and most deadly brain tumors in childhood. Using an integrative genetic analysis of 53 pediatric glioblastomas and five in vitro model systems, we identified previously unidentified gene fusions involving the MET oncogene in similar to 10% of cases. These MET fusions activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and, in cooperation with lesions compromising cell cycle regulation, induced aggressive glial tumors in vivo. MET inhibitors suppressed MET tumor growth in xenograft models. Finally, we treated a pediatric patient bearing a MET-fusion-expressing glioblastoma with the targeted inhibitor crizotinib. This therapy led to substantial tumor shrinkage and associated relief of symptoms, but new treatment-resistant lesions appeared, indicating that combination therapies are likely necessary to achieve a durable clinical response.

Methods: Pregnant women and their partners were recruited during the first trimester from nine sites in Quebec and followed along with their children through to 2 years of age. Questionnaires were administered during pregnancy and post-delivery to collect information on demographics, mental health and life style, medical history, psychosocial measures, diet, infant growth, and neurodevelopment. Information on the delivery and newborn outcomes were abstracted from medical charts. Biological specimens were collected from mothers during each trimester, fathers (once during the pregnancy), and infants (at delivery and 2 years of age) for storage in a biological specimen bank. Results: Of the 9864 women screened, 6348 met the eligibility criteria and 2366 women participated in the study (37% of eligible women). Among women in the 3D cohort, 1721 of their partners (1704 biological fathers) agreed to participate (73%). Two thousand two hundred and nineteen participants had a live singleton birth (94%). Prenatal blood and urine samples as well as vaginal secretions were collected for >= 98% of participants, cord blood for 81% of livebirths, and placental tissue for 89% of livebirths. Conclusions: The 3D Cohort Study combines a rich bank of multiple biological specimens with extensive clinical, life style, and psychosocial data. This data set is a valuable resource for studying the developmental etiology of birth and early childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Methods: We investigated the plasma levels of A beta, proNGF, tPA, neuroserpin, metallo-proteases and inflammatory molecules in 31 individuals with DS (with and without dementia) and in 31 healthy controls. We examined associations between biomarkers and cognitive decline. Results: A beta 40 and A beta 42 were elevated in DS plasma compared to controls, even in DS individuals without dementia. Plasma A beta correlated with the rate of cognitive decline across 2 years. ProNGF, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9 activity, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 were higher in DS plasma, even at AD-asymptomatic stages. Declining plasma A beta 42 and increasing proNGF levels correlated with cognitive decline. A combined measure of A beta and inflammatory molecules was a strong predictor of prospective cognitive deterioration. Conclusions: Our findings support the combination of plasma and cognitive assessments for the identification of DS individuals at risk of dementia. (C) 2016 The Alzheimer's Association.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a screening instrument used to assess different aspects of cognition. Despite its widespread use, norms adjusted to the sociodemographics of Quebec-French people are not yet available. Such norms are however important because performance on neuropsychological tests varies according to sociodemographic variables including age, sex, and education. As such, the present study aimed to establish normative data for the MoCA in middle-aged and elderly Quebec-French population. Method: For that purpose, 1,019 community-dwelling older adults aged between 41 and 98 were recruited. Participants from 12 recruiting sites completed the MoCA. Regression-based normative data were produced and cross-validated with a validation sample (n = 200). Results: Regression analyses indicated that older age, lower education level, and male sex were associated with poorer MoCA scores. The best predictive model included age (p<.001), education (p<.001), sex (p<.001), and a quadratic term for education (education X education; p<.001). This model explained a significant amount of variance of the MoCA score (p<.001, R-2 = 0.26). A regression equation to calculate Z scores is presented. Conclusions: This study provides normative data for the MoCA test in the middle-aged and elderly French-Quebec people. These data will facilitate more accurate detection and follow-up of the risk of cognitive impairment in this population, taking into account culture, age, education, and sex.

Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 66 eyes (33 subjects) with naive unilateral BRVO who underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography using Cirrus HD-OCT. We also included 67 eyes of 48 age-matched healthy volunteers as control group. Average, minimum and sectoral macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness, macular retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and outer retinal thickness were collected. Comparison of the GCIPL, RNFL and outer retinal thicknesses among study eyes, normal fellow eyes and control groups was performed. Results The average and minimum macular GCIPL thicknesses were constantly and diffusely reduced in BRVO compared with normal fellow eyes and healthy controls (p<0.001 for each GCIPL sector). The average macular RNFL thickness was reduced in BRVO eyes compared with normal fellow eyes (p=0.01) and tended to be lower than controls (p=0.07). The minimum RNFL thickness in eyes with BRVO was significantly reduced when compared with fellow eyes (p<0.001) and control eyes (p<0.001). The average outer retina thickness was thicker in BRVO eyes compared with both fellow eyes (p<0.001) and controls (p<0.001). Conclusions A significant reduction of the macular GCIPL and RNFL thicknesses was observed in eyes with BRVO. This finding is suggestive of RGCs degeneration; the neuroprotective effect of current therapeutic options might be an important consideration when evaluating treatment strategies and prognosticating visual outcome in BRVO eyes.

The effect of aging on the brain network for exception word reading	CORTEX			English	Article						Reading network; Aging; fMRI; Exception words; Word processing	PRIMARY-PROGRESSIVE-APHASIA; ANTERIOR TEMPORAL-LOBE; ADULT LIFE-SPAN; SEMANTIC DEMENTIA; SURFACE DYSLEXIA; GRAY-MATTER; FRENCH; AGE; RECOGNITION; REGULARITY	Cognitive and computational models of reading aloud agree on the existence of two procedures for reading. Pseudowords (e.g., atendier) are correctly read through subword processes only while exception words (e.g., pint) are only correctly read via whole-words processes. Regular words can be correctly read by means of either way. Previous behavioral studies showed that older adults relied more on whole-word processing for reading. The aim of the present fMRI study was to verify whether this larger whole-word reliance for reading in older adults was reflected by changes in the pattern of brain activation. Both young and elderly participants read aloud pseudowords, exception and regular words in the scanner. Behavioral results reproduced those of previous studies showing that older adults made significantly less errors when reading exception words. Neuroimaging results showed significant activation of the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), a key region implicated in whole-word reading for exception word reading in both young and elderly participants. Critically, ATL activation was also found for regular word reading in the elderly. No differences were observed in the pattern of activation between regular and pseudo words in the young. In conclusion, these results extend evidence on the critical role of the left ATL for exception word reading to elderly participants. Additionally, our study shows for the first time from a developmental point of view that the behavioral changes found in reading during normal aging also have a brain counterpart in the reading network changes that sustain exception and regular word reading in the elderly.

In this work, we have examined the impact of serum ANGPTL2 on improving cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods A prospective, monocentric cohort of consecutive type 2 diabetes patients (the SURDIAGENE cohort; total of 1353 type 2 diabetes patients; 58% men, mean +/- SD age 64 +/- 11 years) was followed for a median of 6.0 years for death as primary endpoint and major adverse CV events (MACE; i.e. CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke) as a secondary endpoint. Patients with end-stage renal disease, defined as a requirement for dialysis or a history of kidney transplantation, were excluded. Patients were grouped into quartiles according to ANGPTL2 concentrations at inclusion: <11.2 (Q1), 11.2-14.7 (Q2), 14.8-19.5 (Q3) or >19.5 (Q4) ng/ml. Results During follow up, 367 patients (representing 4.5% of the total person-years) died and 290 patients (representing 3.7% of the total person-years) presented with MACE. Both the survival and MACE-free survival rates were significantly different between ANGPTL2 quartiles (logrank 82.12, p < 0.0001 for death; and logrank 65.14, p<0.0001 for MACE). Patients with ANGPTL2 concentrations higher than 19.5 ng/ml (Q4) had a significantly higher risk of death and MACE than those with ANGPTL2 levels of 19.5 ng/ml or less (Q1-3) (HR for death 2.44 [95% CI 1.98, 3.00], p<0.0001; HR for MACE 2.43 [95% CI 1.92, 3.06], p < 0.0001) after adjustment for sex, age and established CV risk factors. Using ANGPTL2 concentrations, prediction of the risk of mortality, as assessed by integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), was significantly improved (IDI 0.006 +/- 0.002, p=0.0002). Conclusions/interpretation In patients with type 2 diabetes, serum ANGPTL2 concentrations were independently associated with death and MACE. Therefore, ANGPTL2 is a promising candidate biomarker for improving risk stratification in type 2 diabetes patients, and may prove to be a valuable therapeutic target.

The effect of pilocarpine (a muscarinic agonist) and atropine (a muscarinic antagonist) on JWH-133 (a CB2 agonist) induced analgesia in mice was studied. First the analgesic effect of JWH-133 (0.001-1mg/Kg) or pilocarpine (2.5-20mg/kg) or atropine (0.2-5mg/kg) was evaluated. Subsequently, the effect of co-administration of pilocarpine (2.5mg/kg) or atropine (5mg/kg) and JWH-133 (0.001-1mg/Kg) were studied too. JWH-133 and pilocarpine provoked antinociception in mice but atropine did not. Pilocarpine potentiated the analgesic effect of JWH-133 but atropine antagonized that. It can be concluded that JWH-133 induced antinociception is affected by muscarinic receptor modulators in mice.	[Alipour, M.; Onsori, S.; Tabrizian, P.; Jafari, M.

The imaging methods are explained along with the advantages of using these very fast and sensitive velocity estimators. These experimental systems are capable of acquiring thousands of images per second for fast moving flow as well as yielding the estimates of low velocity flow. These emerging techniques allow the vector flow systems to assess highly complex flow with transitory vortices and moving tissue, and they can also be used in functional ultrasound imaging for studying brain function in animals. This paper explains the underlying acquisition and estimation methods for fast 2-D and 3-D velocity imaging and gives a number of examples. Future challenges and the potentials of parallel acquisition systems for flow imaging are also discussed.

The first objective of this study was to use structural equation modeling to model the structure of psychopathology in an adolescent community-based sample (N = 2,144) including conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, substance use, anxiety, depression, phobias, and other emotional symptoms, assessed at 16 years. The second objective was to identify common personality and cognitive correlates of psychopathology, assessed at 14 years. Results showed that psychopathology at 16 years fit 2 bifactor models equally well: (a) a bifactor model, reflecting a general psychopathology factor, as well as specific externalizing (representing mainly substance misuse and low ADHD) and internalizing factors; and (b) a bifactor model with a general psychopathology factor and 3 specific externalizing (representing mainly ADHD and ODD), substance use and internalizing factors. The general psychopathology factor was related to high disinhibition/impulsivity, low agreeableness, high neuroticism and hopelessness, high delay-discounting, poor response inhibition and low performance IQ. Substance use was specifically related to high novelty-seeking, sensation-seeking, extraversion, high verbal IQ, and risk-taking. Internalizing psychopathology was specifically related to high neuroticism, hopelessness and anxiety-sensitivity, low novelty-seeking and extraversion, and an attentional bias toward negatively valenced verbal stimuli. Findings reveal several nonspecific or transdiagnostic personality and cognitive factors that may be targeted in new interventions to potentially prevent the development of multiple psychopathologies.

The DISC1 gene is strongly linked to mood disorders and schizophrenia in a Scottish pedigree. In an earlier study we found a sleep homeostasis disturbance in a Drosophila model overexpressing wild-type human DISC1. Here we aimed to explore the relationship between sleep and the DISC1 gene in a mammalian model, a novel transgenic mouse model expressing full-length human DISC1. We assessed circadian rhythms by monitoring wheel running activity under normal 24-h light:dark conditions and in constant darkness and found the DISC1 mice to have normal circadian photoentrainment and normal intrinsic circadian period. We also assessed sleep duration and quality in the DISC1 mice and found that they were awake longer than wild -type controls at baseline with a tendency for lower rebound of delta activity during recovery from a short sleep deprivation. Thus we suggest that DISC1 may be involved in sleep regulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and Japan Neuroscience Society. All rights reserved.

This study explored the neurocognitive architecture that supports this function by examining how individual variation in functional brain organisation predicts comprehension and semantic generation. Participants underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and, on separate days, performed written synonym judgement, and letter and category fluency tasks. We found that better synonym judgement for high frequency items was linked to greater functional coupling between posterior fusiform and anterior superior temporal cortex (aSTG), which might index orthographic-to-semantic access. However, stronger coupling between aSTG and ventromedial prefrontal cortex was associated with poor performance on the same trials, potentially reflecting greater difficulty in focussing retrieval on relevant features for high frequency items that appear in a greater range of contexts. Fluency performance was instead linked to variations in the functional coupling of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG); anterior IFG was more coupled to regions of primary visual cortex for individuals who were good at category fluency, while poor letter fluency was predicted by stronger coupling between posterior IFG and retrosplenial cortex. These results show that individual differences in functional connectivity at rest predict semantic performance and are consistent with a component process account of semantic cognition in which representational information is shaped by control processes to fit the current requirements, in both comprehension and fluency tasks.

However, the normal evolution of epigenetic programs during child development, the effect of sex, and the impact of early life adversity on these trajectories are not well understood. This study mapped the genome-wide DNA methylation changes in CD3+ T lymphocytes from rhesus monkeys from postnatal day 14 through 2 years of age in both males and females and determined the impact of maternal deprivation on the DNA methylation profile. We show here that DNA methylation profiles evolve from birth to adolescence and are sex dependent. DNA methylation changes accompany imposed weaning, attenuating the difference between males and females. Maternal separation at birth alters the normal evolution of DNA methylation profiles and targets genes that are also affected by a later stage maternal separation, that is, weaning. Our results suggest that early life events dynamically interfere with the normal developmental evolution of the DNA methylation profile and that these changes are highly effected by sex.

With a prospective longitudinal design and using normalized raw scores (Z scores) to circumvent floor effects, we measured cognitive functioning of 184 children and adolescents with FXS (ages 6 to 16) using the Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children on one to three occasions for each participant. Participants with FXS received lower raw scores relative to the Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children normative sample across the developmental period. Verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, and processing speed Z scores were marked by a widening gap from the normative sample, while freedom from distractibility Z scores showed a narrowing gap. Key findings include a relative strength for verbal skills in comparison with visuospatial-constructive skills arising in adolescence and a discrepancy between working memory (weakness) and processing speed (strength) in childhood that diminishes in adolescence. Results suggest that the cognitive profile associated with FXS develops dynamically from childhood to adolescence. Findings are discussed within the context of aberrant brain morphology in childhood and maturation in adolescence. We argue that assessing disorder-specific cognitive developmental profiles will benefit future disorder-specific treatment research.

In the type 4 form, these defects show comorbidity with Hirschsprung disease, a disorder marked by an absence of neural ganglia in the distal colon, triggering functional intestinal obstruction. Here, we report that the Spot mouse line - obtained through an insertional mutagenesis screen for genes involved in neural crest cell (NCC) development - is a model for Waardenburg syndrome type 4. We found that the Spot insertional mutation causes overexpression of an overlapping gene pair composed of the transcription-factor-encoding Nr2f1 and the antisense long non-coding RNA A830082K12Rik in NCCs through a mechanism involving relief of repression of these genes. Consistent with the previously described role of Nr2f1 in promoting gliogenesis in the central nervous system, we further found that NCC-derived progenitors of the enteric nervous system fail to fully colonize Spot embryonic guts owing to their premature differentiation in glial cells. Taken together, our data thus identify silencer elements of the Nr2f1-A830082K12Rik gene pair as new candidate loci for Waardenburg syndrome type 4.	[Bergeron, Karl-F.; Nguyen, Chloe M.

Studies on healthy humans using rTMS have shown that disruption of this network, and particularly the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), can result in increased physiological mirror movements. The aim of the present set of experiments was to further investigate the role of dPMC in restricting motor output to the contralateral hand and determine whether physiological mirror movements could be decreased in healthy individuals. Physiological mirror movements were assessed before and after transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over right and left dPMC in three conditions: bilateral, unilateral left and unilateral right stimulation. Mirror EMG activity was assessed immediately before, 0, 10 and 20min after tDCS. Results show that physiological mirroring increased significantly in the hand ipsilateral to cathodal stimulation during bilateral stimulation of the dPMC, 10 and 20min after stimulation compared to baseline. There was no significant modulation of physiological mirroring in the hand ipsilateral to anodal stimulation in the bilateral condition or following unilateral anodal or unilateral cathodal stimulation.

Selective cerebral perfusion prevents abnormalities in glutamate cycling and neuronal apoptosis in a model of infant deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and reperfusion	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Energy metabolism; glucose; glutamate; -aminobutyric acid; neurotransmitters; apoptosis; magnetic resonance spectroscopy	EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE-OXYGENATION; IMMATURE SWINE HEART; FATTY-ACID OXIDATION; IN-VIVO; ARCH RECONSTRUCTION; NEUROLOGICAL INJURY; ENERGY-METABOLISM; BRAIN ACTIVITY; AMINO-ACIDS; RAT-BRAIN	Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest is often required for the repair of complex congenital cardiac defects in infants. However, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest induces neuroapoptosis associated with later development of neurocognitive abnormalities. Selective cerebral perfusion theoretically provides superior neural protection possibly through modifications in cerebral substrate oxidation and closely integrated glutamate cycling. We tested the hypothesis that selective cerebral perfusion modulates glucose utilization, and ameliorates abnormalities in glutamate flux, which occur in association with neuroapoptosis during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Eighteen infant male Yorkshire piglets were assigned randomly to two groups of seven (deep hypothermic circulatory arrest or deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with selective cerebral perfusion for 60 minutes at 18?) and four control pigs without cardiopulmonary bypass support. Carbon-13-labeled glucose as a metabolic tracer was infused, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance were used for metabolic analysis in the frontal cortex. Following 2.5h of cerebral reperfusion, we observed similar cerebral adenosine triphosphate levels, absolute levels of lactate and citric acid cycle intermediates, and carbon-13 enrichment among three groups. However, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest induced significant abnormalities in glutamate cycling resulting in reduced glutamate/glutamine and elevated -aminobutyric acid/glutamate along with neuroapoptosis, which were all prevented by selective cerebral perfusion. The data suggest that selective cerebral perfusion prevents these modifications in glutamate/glutamine/-aminobutyric acid cycling and protects the cerebral cortex from apoptosis.

The aim of the current study was to test for brain regions uniquely associated with positive functioning in the context of adversity, using detailed phenotypic classification. Methods1,870 European adolescents (M-age=14.56years, SDage=0.44years, 51.5% female) underwent MRI scanning and completed behavioral and psychological measures of stressful life events, academic competence, social competence, rule-abiding conduct, personality, and alcohol use. ResultsThe interaction of competence and adversity identified two regions centered on the right middle and superior frontal gyri; grey matter volumes in these regions were larger in adolescents experiencing adversity who showed positive adaptation. Differences in these regions among competence/adversity subgroups were maintained after controlling for several covariates and were robust to alternative operationalization decisions for key constructs. ConclusionsWe demonstrate structural brain correlates of adolescent resilience, and suggest that right prefrontal structures are implicated in adaptive functioning for youth who have experienced adversity.

Early PD can be divided into preclinical, prodromal and clinical stages; in this Review, we focus on the prodromal stage and markers that can be used to identify prodromal PD. We consider the necessary properties of a marker, before providing an overview of the proven and potential markers of prodromal PD, including clinical nonmotor markers, clinical motor markers, neuroimaging markers and tissue biomarkers. Markers for which the ability to predict conversion to PD is supported by the strongest evidence include olfactory loss, REM sleep behaviour disorder and constipation. Markers with the highest diagnostic strength include REM sleep behaviour disorder, dopaminergic imaging and subtle motor parkinsonism. The lead time-the period between the appearance of a marker and conversion to PD-is highly variable between markers, ranging from 5 years for impaired motor performance to > 20 years for autonomic symptoms. The cost of screening for these markers also varies dramatically: some require just questionnaires, whereas others require sophisticated scanning techniques. Finally, we summarize how prodromal and risk markers can be combined to estimate the probability that an individual has prodromal PD, with a focus on the International Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) Prodromal Parkinson Criteria.

On the Analytical Solution of Firing Time for SpikeProp	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							LAMBERT W-FUNCTION; SPIKING NEURONS; NETWORKS	Error backpropagation in networks of spiking neurons (SpikeProp) shows promise for the supervised learning of temporal patterns. However, its widespread use is hindered by its computational load and occasional convergence failures. In this letter, we show that the neuronal firing time equation at the core of SpikeProp can be solved analytically using the Lambert W function, offering a marked reduction in execution time over the step-based method used in the literature. Applying this analytical method to SpikeProp, we find that training time per epoch can be reduced by 12% to 56% under different experimental conditions. Finally, this work opens the way for further investigations of SpikeProp's convergence behavior.

However, details regarding the onset and progression of impaired preterm brain development over the third trimester are unknown. Our primary objective was to compare third-trimester brain volumes and brain growth trajectories in ex utero preterm infants without structural brain injury and in healthy in utero fetuses. As a secondary objective, we examined risk factors associated with brain volumes in preterm infants over the third-trimester postconception. METHODS: Preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) and weighing <1500 g with no evidence of structural brain injury on conventional MRI and healthy pregnant women were prospectively recruited. Anatomic T2-weighted brain images of preterm infants and healthy fetuses were parcellated into the following regions: cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and intracranial cavity. RESULTS: We studied 205 participants (75 preterm infants and 130 healthy control fetuses) between 27 and 39 weeks' GA. Third-trimester brain volumes were reduced and brain growth trajectories were slower in the ex utero preterm group compared with the in utero healthy fetuses in the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and intracranial cavity. Clinical risk factors associated with reduced brain volumes included dexamethasone treatment, the presence of extra-axial blood on brain MRI, confirmed sepsis, and duration of oxygen support. CONCLUSIONS: These preterm infants exhibited impaired third-trimester global and regional brain growth in the absence of cerebral/cerebellar parenchymal injury detected by using conventional MRI.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) - one of the most common bacterium colonizing pregnant women - can be responsible for chorioamnionitis. Given that interleukin (IL)-1 beta has a major role in anti-GBS host defense, we hypothesized that IL-1 beta-driven innate immune response is implicated in GBS-induced chorioamnionitis. Using a rat model of GBS-induced chorioamnionitis, this study showed that inflammatory response to this pathogen was associated with maternal and placental IL-1 beta hyper expression. Following placental chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) production, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) placental infiltration started at 2411 post-GBS exposure, and MMP-10 was released within these placentas. At 72 h, PMN infiltration extended to membranes and to membranes' arteries. This was associated with IL-1 beta release within the fetus blood at 72 h. Such a GBS-associated inflammatory cascade might be deleterious for fetal organs. These results pave the way toward targeted placento-protective anti-inflammatory strategies against GBS-induced chorioamnionitis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this endeavor, the detailed study of individuals who have musical deficiencies is instructive because of likely neurogenetic underpinnings. Such individuals have 'congenital amusia', an umbrella term for lifelong musical disabilities that cannot be attributed to intellectual disability, lack of exposure, or brain damage after birth. Key points are reviewed here that have emerged during recent years regarding the neurobiology of the disorder, focusing on the importance of recurrent processing between the right inferior frontal cortex and the auditory cortex for conscious monitoring of musical pitch, and how this relates to developmental cognitive disorders in general.

Common polymorphisms in folate genes, such as methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1) R653Q, may modulate the effects of elevated folic acid intake. Objectives: We investigated the effects of moderate folic acid supplementation on reproductive outcomes and assessed the potential interaction of the supplemented diet with MTHFD1-synthetase (Mthfd1S) deficiency in mice, which is a model for the R653Q variant. Design: Female Mthfd1S(+/+) and Mthfd1S(+/-) mice were fed a folic acid-supplemented diet (FASD) (5-fold higher than recommended) or control diets before mating and during pregnancy. Embryos and placentas were assessed for developmental defects at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). Maternal folate and choline metabolites and gene expression in folate-related pathways were examined. Results: The combination of FASD and maternal MTHFD1-synthetase deficiency led to a greater incidence of defects in E10.5 embryos (diet X maternal genotype, P = 0.0016; diet X embryonic genotype, P= 0.054). The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) protein and methylation potential [ratio of S-adenosylmethionine (major methyl donor):S-adenosylhomocysteine) were reduced in maternal liver. Although 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (methylTHF) was higher in maternal circulation, the methylation potential was lower in embryos. The presence of developmental delays and defects in Mthfd1S(+/-) embryos was associated with placental defects (P = 0.003). The labyrinth layer failed to form properly in the majority of abnormal placentas, which compromised the integration of the maternal and fetal circulation and presumably the transfer of methylTHF and other nutrients. Conclusions: Moderately higher folate intake and MTHFD1-synthetase deficiency in pregnant mice result in a lower methylation potential in maternal liver and embryos and a greater incidence of defects in embryos. Although maternal circulating methylTHF was higher, it may not have reached the embryos because of abnormal placental development; abnormal placentas were observed predominantly in abnormally developed embryos. These findings have implications for women with high folate intakes, particularly if they are polymorphic for MTHFD1 R653Q.

Animal studies suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor agonists, such as BZDs, may prevent A beta-neurotoxicity and reduce beta-amyloid (A beta). However, no studies have investigated the effects of BZD use on A beta in humans. Methods: This cross-sectional, prospective study using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sites in the United States and Canada on nondemented elderly adults between 55 and 90 years of age assessed cortical A beta levels by positron emission tomography radiotracer F-18-Florbetapir. Changes in global cognitive function and verbal memory performance over 2 years were assessed using scores on Montreal Cognitive Assessment and five domains of Rey AuditoryVerbal Learning Test, respectively. Results: Previous BZD users (N = 15) had lower cortical A beta levels in frontal (F(1, 26) = 8.82, p = 0.006), cingulate (F(1, 26) = 8.58, p = 0.007), parietal (F(1, 26) = 7.31, p = 0.012), and temporal (F(1, 26) = 7.67, p = 0.010) regions compared with matched BZD nonusers (N = 15), after controlling for history of psychiatric disorders and antidepressant use. Also, no differences were found in global cognitive function and changes in cortical A beta over 2 years between continuous BZD users (N = 15) and the matched nonuser group (N = 15). Conclusion: Previous BZD use was associated with lower cortical A beta levels in nondemented elderly control subjects. Future studies with larger samples are required to replicate our findings.

We investigated the safety and therapeutic efficacy of an adjunct high-frequency rTMS programme targeting the left DLPFC. Forty-seven women with bulimia nervosa were randomised to a real or sham stimulation group. The real group underwent 10 rTMS sessions, each consisting of 20 trains of 5seconds with 55-second intervals between trains, at a frequency of 10Hz. The main outcome was the number of binge episodes in the 15days following the end of stimulation. Overall, no significant improvement in bingeing and purging symptoms was noted after the programme. rTMS was well tolerated. This suggests that 10 sessions of high-frequency rTMS to the left DLPFC provide no greater benefit than placebo. Future studies should consider methodological issues as well as alternative targets.

This prospective study aimed to shed light on the role of phonological abilities. Fourteen Duchenne muscular dystrophy children and 7 healthy children underwent mismatch negativity. Moreover, verbal intelligence, visuospatial attention, immediate verbal memory, working memory, grammar, vocabulary, visuomotor skills, reading, text comprehension, writing, and arithmetic were tested in Duchenne muscular dystrophy children. No significant difference between control and Duchenne muscular dystrophy children was found neither for mismatch negativity amplitude (P = .191 and .116, respectively) nor for latency (P = .135). Eight (57.14%) patients showed an impairment of immediate verbal memory and of visuomotor skills, 7 (63.64%) patients had a deficit in writing and arithmetic skills, even with a mean normal intelligence quotient. Taken together, the results put in evidence a heterogeneous neuropsychological profile not explainable on the basis of a phonological deficit.

Method: Data were collected 12, 14, and 16 years post baseline (mean age 24.7 years at 16 years postbaseline) from 476 participants with ADHD diagnosed at age 7 to 9 years, and 241 age- and sex-matched classmates. Probands were subgrouped on persistence versus desistence of DSM-5 symptom count. Orthogonal comparisons contrasted ADHD versus LNCG and symptom-persistent (50%) versus symptom-desistent (50%) subgroups. Functional outcomes were measured with standardized and demographic instruments. Results: Three patterns of functional outcomes emerged. Post-secondary education, times fired/quit a job, current income, receiving public assistance, and risky sexual behavior showed the most common pattern: the LNCG group fared best, symptom-persistent ADHD group worst, and symptom-desistent ADHD group between, with the largest effect sizes between LNCG and symptom persistent ADHD. In the second pattern, seen with emotional outcomes (emotional lability, neuroticism, anxiety disorder, mood disorder) and substance use outcomes, the LNCG and symptom-desistent ADHD group did not differ, but both fared better than the symptom persistent ADHD group. In the third pattern, noted with jail time (rare), alcohol use disorder (common), and number of jobs held, group differences were not significant. The ADHD group had 10 deaths compared to one death in the LNCG. Conclusion: Adult functioning after childhood ADHD varies by domain and is generally worse when ADHD symptoms persist. It is important to identify factors and interventions that promote better functional outcomes.

The N200 is associated with attentional control, thus training-related improvements in attentional control should be paralleled by enhancements to the N200. Older participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups, which focused on training different levels of attentional control: (1) single-task training (single), where participants trained on 2 tasks in isolation; (2) fixed divided attention training (fixed), where participants trained on 2 tasks simultaneously; and (3) variable divided attention training (variable), where participants trained on 2 tasks simultaneously but were instructed to alternatively prioritize each of the 2 tasks. After training, the amplitude of the N200 wave increased in dual-task conditions for the variable group, and this enhancement was correlated with improved dual-task performance. Participants in the variable group also had the greatest improvement in the ability to modulate their allocation of attention in accordance with task instructions to the less salient and less complex of the 2 tasks. Training older adults to modulate their division of attention between tasks improves neural functions associated with attentional control of the trained tasks.

While synaptic deficits are commonly found in animal models of amyloidosis, it is unclear how amyloid pathology may impair synaptic functions. In some amyloid mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, however, synaptic deficits are preceded by hyperexcitability of glutamate synapses. In the amyloid transgenic mouse model TgCRND8, we therefore investigated whether early enhancement of glutamatergic transmission was responsible for development of later synaptic deficits. Hippocampi from 1-month-old TgCRND8 mice revealed increased basal transmission and plasticity of glutamate synapses that was related to increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Treating these 1-month-old mice for 4 weeks with the TNFa inhibitor XPro1595 prevented synaptic deficits otherwise apparent at the age of 6 months. In this mouse model at least, reversing the hyperexcitability of glutamate synapses via TNFa blockade before the onset of amyloid plaque formation prevented later synaptic deficits.

Distribution of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) in canines after intracerebroventricular injection	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						hUCB-MSCs; Canine model; Intracerebroventricular; Distribution	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE MODEL; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; BONE-MARROW; TRANSPLANTATION; BRAIN; THERAPY; MOUSE; MICE; FLOW	In this study, we investigated the distribution of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) administered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection in a canine model. Ten beagles (11-13 kg per beagle) each received an injection of 1 x 10(6) cells into the right lateral ventricle and were sacrificed 7 days after administration. Based on immunohistochemical analysis, hUCB-MSCs were observed in the brain parenchyma, especially along the lateral ventricular walls. Detected as far as 3.5 mm from the cortical surface, these cells migrated from the lateral ventricle toward the cortex. We also observed hUCB-MSCs in the hippocampus and the cervical spinal cord. According to real-time polymerase chain reaction results, most of the hUCB-MSCs were found distributed in the brain and the cervical spinal cord but not in the lungs, heart, kidneys, spleen, and liver. ICV administered hUCB-MSCs also enhanced the endogenous neural stem cell population in the subventricular zone. These results highlighted the ICV delivery route as an optimal route to be performed in stem cell-based clinical therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous work has described local functional gradients extending from perceptual and motor regions to cortical areas representing more abstract functions, but an overarching framework for the association between structure and function is still lacking. Here, we show that the principal gradient revealed by the decomposition of connectivity data in humans and the macaque monkey is anchored by, at one end, regions serving primary sensory/motor functions and at the other end, transmodal regions that, in humans, are known as the default-mode network (DMN). These DMN regions exhibit the greatest geodesic distance along the cortical surface-and are precisely equidistant-from primary sensory/motor morphological landmarks. The principal gradient also provides an organizing spatial framework for multiple large-scale networks and characterizes a spectrum from unimodal to heteromodal activity in a functional metaanalysis. Together, these observations provide a characterization of the topographical organization of cortex and indicate that the role of the DMN in cognition might arise from its position at one extreme of a hierarchy, allowing it to process transmodal information that is unrelated to immediate sensory input.

Formation of functional hypoglossal nerve circuits depends on the establishment of precise hypoglossal motor neuron maps correlating with specific tongue muscle innervations. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling mammalian hypoglossal motor neuron topographic map formation. Here we show that combinatorial expression of transcription factors Runx1, SCIP and FoxP1 defines separate mouse hypoglossal motor neuron groups with different topological, neurotransmitter and calcium-buffering phenotypes. Runx1 and SCIP are coexpressed in ventromedial hypoglossal motor neurons involved in control of tongue protrusion whereas FoxP1 is expressed in dorsomedial motor neurons associated with tongue retraction. Establishment of separate hypoglossal motor neuron maps depends in part on Runx1-mediated suppression of ventrolateral and dorsomedial motor neuron phenotypes and regulation of FoxP1 expression pattern. These findings suggest that combinatorial actions of Runx1, SCIP and FoxP1 are important for mouse hypoglossal nucleus somatotopic map formation.

The rhinal sulcus delineates the entorhinal cortex on the anterior portion of the parahippocampal gyrus. Posterior to the rhinal sulcus lies the collateral sulcus proper which delineates the parahippocampal cortex that occupies the posterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus. A small sulcus, the parahippocampal extension of the collateral sulcus, runs transversely within the parahippocampal gyrus. The rhinal sulcus, the collateral sulcus proper, and the parahippocampal extension of the collateral sulcus were identified on magnetic resonance images of 40 healthy human brains and probability maps were created to provide quantification of the location variability within standard stereotaxic space. These probability maps can act as a reference frame for the accurate identification of key components of the parahippocampal region and assist in the interpretation of structural and functional changes obtained in neuroimaging studies.

Allostatic load algorithms that quantify biological wear and tear represent a comprehensive approach to detect multisystemic disease processes of the mind and body. However, the multiple morbidities directly or indirectly related to stress physiology remain enigmatic. Our aim in this article is to propose that biological comorbidities represent discrete pathophysiological processes captured by measuring allostatic load. This has applications in research and clinical settings to predict physical and psychiatric comorbidities alike. The reader will be introduced to the concepts of allostasis, allostasic states, allostatic load, and allostatic overload as they relate to stress-related diseases and the proposed prediction of biological comorbidities that extend rather to understanding psychopathologies. In our transdisciplinary discussion, we will integrate perspectives related to (a) mitochondrial biology as a key player in the allostatic load time course toward diseases that get under the skin and skull; (b) epigenetics related to child maltreatment and biological embedding that shapes stress perception throughout lifespan development; and (c) evolutionary drivers of distinct personality profiles and biobehavioral patterns that are linked to dimensions of psychopathology.

Here, we sought to link transient changes in functional brain networks to individual differences in behavioral and cognitive performance by using an active learning paradigm. Participants learned associations between pairs of unrelated visual stimuli by using feedback. Interindividual behavioral variability was quantified with a learning rate measure. By using a multivariate statistical framework (partial least squares), we identified patterns of network organization across multiple temporal scales (within a trial, millisecond; across a learning session, minute) and linked these to the rate of change in behavioral performance (fast and slow). Results indicated that posterior network connectivity was present early in the trial for fast, and later in the trial for slow performers. In contrast, connectivity in an associative memory network (frontal, striatal, and medial temporal regions) occurred later in the trial for fast, and earlier for slow performers. Time-dependent changes in the posterior network were correlated with visual/spatial scores obtained from independent neuropsychological assessments, with fast learners performing better on visual/spatial subtests. No relationship was found between functional connectivity dynamics in the memory network and visual/spatial test scores indicative of cognitive skill. By using a comprehensive set of measures (behavioral, cognitive, and neurophysiological), we report that individual variations in learning-related performance change are supported by differences in cognitive ability and time-sensitive connectivity in functional neural networks.

Its pathophysiology is associated with a strong pro-inflammatory reaction and the activation of glial cells. Among modulators released during the infection, heme seems to play a controversial role in the pathophysiology of malaria. Herein, we first investigated the phenotype of glial cells during cerebral malaria in C57BL/6 mice infected with P. berghei ANKA. Given the fact that high levels of heme were associated with cerebral malaria, we then investigated its impact on microglial, astrocyte, and T cell responses to further clarify its contribution in the neuropathophysiology. Surprisingly, we found that administration of heme twice a day from day three of infection induced the expression of the Heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) gene and prevented brain damages. More specifically, heme inhibited the M1 phenotype of microglia, hampered the activation of astrocytes, and decreased the cerebral expression of Ifng, Tnfa and Ip10. Heme might that way alter the migration of pathogenic CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes within the brain observed during cerebral malaria. Taking into account that cerebral malaria results from a complex interplay between host- and parasite-derived factors, it is possible that genetic polymorphisms of Hmox1, which could be associated with the control of systemic levels of heme during P. falciparum infection, might explain its dual role and its contribution to the resistance to cerebral malaria.

Subcortical capsular stroke has a poor prognosis, and it is not yet fully understood how and under what circumstances reach training contributes to motor recovery. Objective. This study was performed to investigate changes in neuronal circuits and motor recovery in a chronic capsular stroke model in the presence or absence of reach training. Method. We generated photothrombotic capsular lesions in 42 Sprague-Dawley rats and evaluated motor recovery with or without daily training in a single-pellet reaching task (SPRT). We used 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose-microPET (positron emission tomography) to assess remodeling of neuronal circuits. Results. SPRT training was selectively beneficial only for the group with incomplete capsular destruction (P < .05), suggesting the relevance of plasticity in the remaining capsular fibers for motor recovery. Groups that did not receive SPRT training showed no motor recovery at all. The microPET analysis demonstrated that motor recovery was correlated with a reduction in cortical diaschisis in ipsilesional motor and sensory cortices and in the contralesional sensory cortex (Pearson's correlation, P < .05). We also observed training-dependent subcortical activation in the contralesional red nucleus, the internal capsule, and the ventral hippocampus (P < .0025; false discovery rate q < 0.05). The groups without reach training did not show the same degree of reduction in diaschisis or activation of the red nucleus. Conclusions. Our results suggest that motor recovery and remodeling of neuronal circuits after capsular stroke depend on the magnitude of the capsular lesion and on the presence or absence of reach training. Task-specific training is strongly indicated only when there is incomplete destruction of the capsular fibers.

Methods: Pairs of independent reviewers screened 12,323 publications derived from a search strategy for MEDLINE to identify articles investigating the association of age at menopause/reproductive period with (i) dementia and (ii) cognitive function; a snowball of eligible articles and reviews was conducted and authors were contacted for additional information. Random-effect models were used for the meta analysis. Results: Age at menopause (13 studies; 19,449 participants) and reproductive period (4 studies; 9916 participants) in the highest categories were not associated with odds of dementia (effect size [ES]: 0.97 [0.78-1.21]) and Alzheimer's disease (ES: 1.06 [0.71-1.58]). Significant heterogeneity was however noted in both analyses (12: 63.3%, p = 0.003 and 12: 72.6%, p = 0.01, respectively). Subgroup analyses by outcome assessment, study design, level of adjustment and study quality did not materially change the findings. In 9/13 studies assessing cognitive function, advanced age at menopause/longer reproductive period was significantly associated with better cognitive performance/lower decline. Due to statistical differences, no meta-analysis was possible for cognitive function. Conclusions: Existing evidence does not support an association between indices of prolonged exposure to female hormones and lower dementia risk. There are indications, however, for better cognitive performance and delayed cognitive decline, supporting a link between female hormone deficiency and cognitive aging. Current literature limitations, indicated by the heterogeneous study-set, point towards research priorities in this clinically relevant area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The majority of layer-dependent studies have, so far, relied on gradient-recalled echo (GRE) blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) acquisitions, which are weighted towards the large draining veins at the cortical surface. The current study aims to obtain quantitative brain activity responses in the primary motor cortex on a laminar scale without the contamination due to accompanying secondary vascular effects. Evoked oxidative metabolism was evaluated using the Davis model, to investigate its applicability, advantages, and limits in lamina-dependent fMRI. Average values for the calibration parameter, M, and for changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) during a unilateral finger-tapping task were (11 +/- 2)% and (30 +/- 7)%, respectively, with distinct variation features across the cortical depth. The results presented here showed an uncoupling between BOLD-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and metabolic changes across cortical depth, while the tight coupling between CMRO2 and CBV was conserved across cortical layers. We conclude that the Davis model can help to obtain estimates of lamina-dependent metabolic changes without contamination from large draining veins, with high consistency and reproducibility across participants.

The biological compatibility of chronic microelectrode arrays (MEA) is an essential factor that must be taken into account in their design and fabrication. In order to improve biocompatibility of the MEAs, the surface of the electrodes was coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and parylene-C, which are biocompatible polymers. An in vitro study was performed to test the capacity of poly-D-lysine (PDL) to improve neural-cell adhesion and proliferation. Increased proliferation of the neuroblast cells on the microelectrodes was observed in the presence of the PDL The presence of the peptide on the electrode surface was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The impedance of the electrodes was not changed significantly before and after PDL deposition. Mouse neuroblast cells were seeded and cultured on the PDL coated and uncoated neural MEAs with different tip-coatings such as platinum, molybdenum, gold, sputtered iridium oxide, and carbon nanotubes. The neuroblast cells grew preferentially on and around peptide coated-microelectrode tips, as compared to the uncoated microelectrodes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Self-motion evokes precise spike timing in the primate vestibular system	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CHOICE-RELATED ACTIVITY; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; AVIAN COCHLEAR NUCLEUS; METRIC-SPACE ANALYSIS; DETECTION THRESHOLDS; TEMPORAL PRECISION; NERVE AFFERENTS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; HEAD MOTION; DISCRIMINATION THRESHOLDS	The accurate representation of self-motion requires the efficient processing of sensory input by the vestibular system. Conventional wisdom is that vestibular information is exclusively transmitted through changes in firing rate, yet under this assumption vestibular neurons display relatively poor detection and information transmission. Here, we carry out an analysis of the system's coding capabilities by recording neuronal responses to repeated presentations of naturalistic stimuli. We find that afferents with greater intrinsic variability reliably discriminate between different stimulus waveforms through differential patterns of precise (similar to 6 ms) spike timing, while those with minimal intrinsic variability do not. A simple mathematical model provides an explanation for this result. Postsynaptic central neurons also demonstrate precise spike timing, suggesting that higher brain areas also represent self-motion using temporally precise firing. These findings demonstrate that two distinct sensory channels represent vestibular information: one using rate coding and the other that takes advantage of precise spike timing.

Associations between education and brain structure at age 73 years, adjusted for age 11 IQ	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							WHITE-MATTER MICROSTRUCTURE; OLD-AGE; CORTICAL THICKNESS; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; MRI DATA; INTELLIGENCE; TRACTOGRAPHY; CHILDHOOD; INTEGRITY; DISEASE	Objective: To investigate how associations between education and brain structure in older age were affected by adjusting for IQ measured at age 11. Methods: We analyzed years of full-time education and measures from an MRI brain scan at age 73 in 617 community-dwelling adults born in 1936. In addition to average and vertex-wise cortical thickness, we measured total brain atrophy and white matter tract fractional anisotropy. Associations between brain structure and education were tested, covarying for sex and vascular health; a second model also covaried for age 11 IQ. Results: The significant relationship between education and average cortical thickness (beta = 0.124, p = 0.004) was reduced by 23% when age 11 IQ was included (beta = 0.096, p = 0.041). Initial associations between longer education and greater vertex-wise cortical thickness were significant in bilateral temporal, medial-frontal, parietal, sensory, and motor cortices. Accounting for childhood intelligence reduced the number of significant vertices by >90%; only bilateral anterior temporal associations remained. Neither education nor age 11 IQ was significantly associated with total brain atrophy or tract-averaged fractional anisotropy. Conclusions: The association between years of education and brain structure approximate to 60 years later was restricted to cortical thickness in this sample; however, the previously reported associations between longer education and a thicker cortex are likely to be overestimates in terms of both magnitude and distribution. This finding has implications for understanding, and possibly ameliorating, life-course brain health.

Although complete or peripheral ABHD6 loss of function is protective against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, the role of ABHD6 in the central control of energy balance is unknown. Using a viral-mediated knockout approach, targeted endocannabinoid measures, and pharmacology, we discovered that mice lacking ABHD6 from neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHKO) have higher VMH 2-AG levels in conditions of endocannabinoid recruitment and fail to physiologically adapt to key metabolic challenges. VMHKO mice exhibited blunted fasting-induced feeding and reduced food intake, energy expenditure, and adaptive thermogenesis in response to cold exposure, high-fat feeding, and dieting (transition to a low-fat diet). Our findings identify ABHD6 as a regulator of the counter-regulatory responses to major metabolic shifts, including fasting, nutrient excess, cold, and dieting, thereby highlighting the importance of ABHD6 in the VMH in mediating energy metabolism flexibility.

Humans commonly perform while upright; yet, many neuroimaging methodologies require participants to remain motionless and adhere to non-ecological comportments within a confined space. This inconsistency between ecological postures and imaging constraints undermines the transferability and generalizability of many a neuroimaging assay. Here we highlight the influence of posture on brain function and behavior. Specifically, we challenge the tacit assumption that brain processes and cognitive performance are comparable across a spectrum of positions. We provide an integrative synthesis regarding the increasingly prominent influence of imaging postures on autonomic function, mental capacity, sensory thresholds, and neural activity. Arguing that neuroimagers and cognitive scientists could benefit from considering the influence posture wields on both general functioning and brain activity, we examine existing imaging technologies and the potential of portable and versatile imaging devices (e.g., functional near infrared spectroscopy). Finally, we discuss ways that accounting for posture may help unveil the complex brain processes of everyday cognition.

However, findings from direct comparisons of the cerebral oxygenation patterns of younger (YA) and older (OA) adults during dual-task walking are mixed and it is unclear how YA and OA respond to increasing cognitive load (difficulty) while walking. This functional near infra-red (fNIRS) study examined cerebral oxygenation of YA and OA during self-paced dual-task treadmill walking at two different levels of cognitive load (auditory n-back). Changes in accuracy (%) as well as oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin were examined. For the HbO and HbR measures, eight regions of interest (ROls) were assessed: the anterior and posterior dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC (aDLPFC, pDLPFC, aVLPFC, pVLPFC) in each hemisphere. Nineteen YA (M = 21.83 years) and 14 OA (M = 66.85 years) walked at a self-selected pace while performing auditory 1-back and 2-back tasks. Walking alone (single motor: SM) and performing the cognitive tasks alone (single cognitive: SC) were compared to dual-task walking (DT = SM + SC). In the behavioural data, participants were more accurate in the lowest level of load (1-back) compared to the highest (2-back; p < 0.001). YA were more accurate than OA overall (p = 0.009), and particularly in the 2-back task (p = 0.048). In the fNIRS data, both younger and older adults had task effects (SM < DT) in specific ROls for A HbO (three YA, one OA) and Delta HbR (seven YA, eight OA). After controlling for walk speed differences, direct comparisons between YA and OA did not reveal significant age differences, but did reveal a difficulty effect in HbO in the left aDLPFC (13 = 0.028) and significant task effects (SM < DT) in HbR for six of the eight ROls. Findings suggest that YA and OA respond similarly to manipulations of cognitive load when walking on a treadmill at a self-selected pace.

Continuing Medical Education programs are essential in maintaining physician accreditation. Haitian physicians have expressed a lack access to these activities. The Haiti Medical Education Project works in alliance with Haitian medical leadership, faculty and students to support the Country's medical education system. We present the creation, delivery and evaluation of a competency-based continuing medical education curriculum for physicians in rural Haiti. Methods: Real time lectures from local and international institutions were teleconferenced to physicians in remote Haitian sites using VidyoConferencing (TM) technology. With American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and College of Family Physicians Canada (CFPC) guidelines as references, a competency-derived syllabus was created for a Haitian continuing medical education program. The resulting educational goals were reviewed by a committee of Haitian and North American physician/medical education practitioners to reflect local needs. All authors reviewed lectures and then conferred to establish agreement on competencies presented for each lecture. Results: Sixty-seven lectures were delivered. Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, ophthalmologic, infectious diseases, renal and endocrine competencies were well-represented, with more than 50 % of the joint AAFP and CFPC recommended competencies outlined. Areas under-represented included allergy and immunology, cardiology, surgery, pain management, gastroenterology, neurology, pulmonology, men's health and rheumatology; these topics accounted for less than 25 % of AAFP/CFPC recommended competencies. Areas not covered included geriatrics, nutrition, occupational health and women's health. Within practice-based lectures, only disaster medicine, health promotion and information management were included, but only partially covered. Conclusions: We identified teaching goals covered and competencies that were missing from a CME program for rural Haitian physicians. We aim to use this analysis to provide a competency-based CME lecture series that proportionally meets local needs while following recommendations of recognized national family medicine organizations.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a key integrator of cellular stress responses and an important regulator of mRNA translation. Diverse stress signals lead to the phosphorylation of the a subunit of eIF2 (Ser51), resulting in inhibition of global protein synthesis while promoting expression of proteins that mediate cell adaptation to stress. Here we report that eIF2 alpha is instrumental in the control of noxious heat sensation. Mice with decreased eIF2 alpha phosphorylation (eIF2 alpha(+/S51A)) exhibit reduced responses to noxious heat. Pharmacological attenuation of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation decreases thermal, but not mechanical, pain sensitivity, whereas increasing eIF2 alpha phosphorylation has the opposite effect on thermal nociception. The impact of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation (p-eIF2 alpha) on thermal thresholds is dependent on the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1. Moreover, we show that induction of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation in primary sensory neurons in a chronic inflammation pain model contributes to thermal hypersensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the cellular stress response pathway, mediated via p-eIF2 alpha, represents a mechanism that could be used to alleviate pathological heat sensation.

Past studies on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have identified atypical responses to fine visual information but did not investigate the time course of the sampling of information at different levels of granularity (i.e. Spatial Frequencies, SF). Here, we examined this question during an object recognition task in ASD and neurotypical observers using a novel experimental paradigm. Our results confirm and characterize with unprecedented precision a coarse-to-fine sampling of SF information in neurotypical observers. In ASD observers, we discovered a different pattern of SF sampling across time: in the first 80 ms, high SFs lead ASD observers to a higher accuracy than neurotypical observers, and these SFs are sampled differently across time in the two subject groups. Our results might be related to the absence of a mandatory precedence of global information, and to top-down processing abnormalities in ASD.

Existing evidence-based treatments for children include patching the nonamblyopic eye to encourage use of the amblyopic eye. Currently there are no widely accepted treatments available for adults with amblyopia. The aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of a new binocular, videogame-based treatment for amblyopia in older children and adults. We hypothesise that binocular treatment will significantly improve amblyopic eye visual acuity relative to placebo treatment. Methods/design: The BRAVO study is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre trial to assess the effectiveness of a novel videogame-based binocular treatment for amblyopia. One hundred and eight participants aged 7 years or older with anisometropic and/or strabismic amblyopia (defined as >= 0.2 LogMAR interocular visual acuity difference, >= 0.3 LogMAR amblyopic eye visual acuity and no ocular disease) will be recruited via ophthalmologists, optometrists, clinical record searches and public advertisements at five sites in New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong and Australia. Eligible participants will be randomised by computer in a 1: 1 ratio, with stratification by age group: 7-12, 13-17 and 18 years and older. Participants will be randomised to receive 6 weeks of active or placebo home-based binocular treatment. Treatment will be in the form of a modified interactive falling-blocks game, implemented on a 5th generation iPod touch device viewed through red/green anaglyphic glasses. Participants and those assessing outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome is the change in best-corrected distance visual acuity in the amblyopic eye from baseline to 6 weeks post randomisation. Secondary outcomes include distance and near visual acuity, stereopsis, interocular suppression, angle of strabismus (where applicable) measured at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks post randomisation. Treatment compliance and acceptability will also be assessed along with quality of life for adult participants. Discussion: The BRAVO study is the first randomised controlled trial of a home-based videogame treatment for older children and adults with amblyopia. The results will indicate whether a binocular approach to amblyopia treatment conducted at home is effective for patients aged 7 years or older.

Sortilin regulates sorting and secretion of Sonic hedgehog	JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE			English	Article						Hedgehog; Sortilin; Trafficking; Secretion; Neuron; Golgi	RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; RECEPTOR-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; RODENT OPTIC-NERVE; LYSOSOMAL TRAFFICKING; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; PROXIMITY LIGATION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; TARGET-CELLS; IN-SITU; BRAIN	Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted morphogen that is an essential regulator of patterning and growth. The Shh full-length protein undergoes autocleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum to generate the biologically active N-terminal fragment (ShhN), which is destined for secretion. We identified sortilin (Sort1), a member of the VPS10P-domain receptor family, as a new Shh trafficking receptor. We demonstrate that Sort-Shh interact by performing coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays in transfected cells and that they colocalize at the Golgi. Sort1 overexpression causes re-distribution of ShhN and, to a lesser extent, of full-length Shh to the Golgi and reduces Shh secretion. We show loss of Sort1 can partially rescue Hedgehog-associated patterning defects in a mouse model that is deficient in Shh processing, and we show that Sort1 levels negatively regulate anterograde Shh transport in axons in vitro and Hedgehog-dependent axon-glial interactions in vivo. Taken together, we conclude that Shh and Sort1 can interact at the level of the Golgi and that Sort1 directs Shh away from the pathways that promote its secretion.

Wide-field spontaneous Raman spectroscopy imaging system for biological tissue interrogation	OPTICS LETTERS			English	Article							PROBE	Raman spectroscopy has shown great promise as a method to discriminate between cancerous and normal tissue/cells for a range of oncology applications using microscopy and tissue interrogation instruments such as handheld probes and needles. Here we are presenting preliminary steps toward the development of a practical handheld macroscopic Raman spectroscopy instrument, demonstrating its capabilities to discriminate between different biological tissue types during ex vivo porcine experiments. The novel probe design can image a field of view of 25 mm(2) with a spatial resolution < 100 mu m and an average spectral resolution of 95 cm(-1), covering the fingerprint region between 450 to 1750 cm(-1). The ability of the system to produce tissue maps based on molecular characteristics is demonstrated using a neural network machine learning technique.

In an effort to develop a selective HDAC6 inhibitor which can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), a modified hydroxamate derivative (compound 3) was designed and synthetized. This compound was predicted to have potential for BBB penetration based on in silico and in vitro evaluation of passive permeability. When tested for its HDAC inhibitory activity, the IC50 value of compound 3 towards HDAC6 was in the nM range in both enzymatic and cell-based assays. Compound 3 showed a cell-based selectivity profile close to that of tubastatin A in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, and a good BBB permeability profile. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most traditional energy sources such as coal or petroleum are among the non-renewable types and most likely to be depleted in the forthcoming decades. To address the current energy crisis, use of renewable energy such as solar sources and a considerable increase in energy efficiency are proposed as the potential solutions. District heating systems (DHS), in particular, has recently received more attention due to several advantages in energy production, distribution and consumption for the space heating. This paper reviews the recent advancements in the energy production, modelling and optimization of the DHSs. A classification of energy sources is presented in terms of their sustainability and ease of integration to a DHS. Current modelling methods are further compared with respect to computational limitations, level of precision as well as the degree of certainty in the output level. Moreover, the recent studies of DHS are classified in accordance with the optimization objectives, including energy/exergy efficiency, cost, exergo-economic/thermo-economic and green-house gas (GHG) and pollutant production.

Unravelling the Mechanism of TrkA-Induced Cell Death by Macropinocytosis in Medulloblastoma Daoy Cells	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; CLATHRIN-INDEPENDENT ENDOCYTOSIS; RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE; RHO-FAMILY GTPASES; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; PC12 CELLS; GLIOBLASTOMA CELLS; ACTIVATED RAS; NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION; LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID	Macropinocytosis is a normal cellular process by which cells internalize extracellular fluids and nutrients from their environment and is one strategy that Ras-transformed pancreatic cancer cells use to increase uptake of amino acids to meet the needs of rapid growth. Paradoxically, in non-Ras transformed medulloblastoma brain tumors, we have shown that expression and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA overactivates macropinocytosis, resulting in the catastrophic disintegration of the cell membrane and in tumor cell death. The molecular basis of this uncontrolled form of macropinocytosis has not been previously understood. Here, we demonstrate that the overactivation of macropinocytosis is caused by the simultaneous activation of two TrkA-mediated pathways: (i) inhibition of RhoB via phosphorylation at Ser(185) by casein kinase 1, which relieves actin stress fibers, and (ii) FRS2-scaffolded Src and H-Ras activation of RhoA, which stimulate actin reorganization and the formation of lamellipodia.

The present work was aimed at describing the effect of a DDC lesion on the distribution of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLIR) following intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Rats were implanted with monopolar electrodes and divided into three groups; the first two groups were trained to self-stimulate at the LH, whereas the third group received no stimulation and served as a control. Among the two groups that were trained for ICSS, one of them received a lesion at the DDC and was tested for ICSS on the subsequent 5 days. On the last day of testing, control rats were placed in operant chambers without receiving any stimulation, and the remaining rats were allowed to receive the stimulation for 1 h. All rats were then processed for FLIR. As previously shown, a lesion at the DDC resulted in significant attenuations of the rewarding effectiveness of LH stimulation. Results also show a higher FUR in several reward-related areas following LH stimulation, especially in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulation electrode. Compared to non-lesioned rats, lesioned animals had lower FLIR in certain brain regions, suggesting that those regions that were activated by the rewarding stimulation may be functionally interconnected with the DDC.

Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI), also called acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), is a ubiquitously expressed protein originally identified based on its ability to displace diazepam from its binding site on the GABA(A) receptor. Central administration of ACBP or its cleaved fragment, commonly referred to as endozepines, induces proconflict and anxiety-like behaviour in rodents. For this reason, ACBP is known as an anxiogenic peptide. However, the role of endogenous ACBP in anxiety-like behaviour and anxiolytic responses to diazepam has not been investigated. To address this question, we assessed anxiety behaviour and anxiolytic responses to diazepam in two complementary loss-of-function mouse models including astrocyte-specific ACBP KO (ACBP(GFAP) KO) and whole-body KO (ACBP KO) mice. Male and female ACBP(GFAP) KO and ACBP KO mice do not show significant changes in anxiety-like behaviour compared to control littermates during elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF) tests. Surprisingly, ACBP(GFAP) KO and ACBP KO mice were unresponsive to the anxiolytic effect of a low dose of diazepam during EPM tests. In conclusion, our experiments using genetic ACBP loss-of-function models suggest that endozepines deficiency does not affect anxiety-like behaviour in mice and impairs the anxiolytic action of diazepam.

Amyloidogenic processing of APP through secretases leads to the generation of toxic amyloid (A) peptides, which are regarded as the molecular cause of the disease. We report here an alternative processing pathway of APP through the mammalian intramembrane rhomboid protease RHBDL4. RHBDL4 efficiently cleaves APP inside the cell, thus bypassing APP from amyloidogenic processing, leading to reduced A levels. RHBDL4 cleaves APP multiple times in the ectodomain, resulting in several N- and C-terminal fragments that are not further degraded by classical APP secretases. Knockdown of endogenous RHBDL4 results in decreased levels of C-terminal fragments derived from endogenous APP. Similarly, we found the APP family members APLP1 and APLP2 to be substrates of RHBDL4. We conclude that RHBDL4-mediated APP processing provides insight into APP and rhomboid physiology and qualifies for further investigations to elaborate its impact on Alzheimer disease pathology.

Early Growth Response 1 (Egr-1) Is a Transcriptional Activator of beta-Secretase 1 (BACE-1) in the Brain	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						amyloid-beta (A); early growth response protein 1 (EGR1); gene regulation; neuroscience; promoter; transcription factor	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; IN-VIVO; A-BETA; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; PRESENILIN-2 GENE; PROMOTER ACTIVITY; MAMMALIAN BRAIN; EXPRESSION	Accumulation of amyloid- peptide (A) in the brain is regarded as central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. A is generated by a sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by -secretase 1 (BACE-1) followed by -secretase. BACE-1 cleavage of APP is the committed step in A synthesis. Understanding the mechanism by which BACE-1 is activated leading to A synthesis in the brain can provide better understanding of AD pathology and help to develop novel therapies. In this study, we found that the levels of A and BACE-1 are significantly reduced in the brains of mice lacking transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr-1) when compared with the WT. We demonstrate that in COS-7 cells, Egr-1 binds to the BACE-1 promoter and activates BACE-1 transcription. In rat hippocampal primary neurons, overexpression of Egr-1 induces BACE-1 expression, activates BACE-1, promotes amyloidogenic APP processing, and enhances A synthesis. In mouse hippocampal primary neurons, knockdown of BACE-1 almost completely blocks Egr-1-induced amyloidogenic APP processing and A synthesis. Our data indicate that Egr-1 promotes A synthesis via transcriptional activation of BACE-1 and suggest that Egr-1 plays role in activation of BACE-1 and acceleration of A synthesis in AD brain. Egr-1 is a potential therapeutic target for AD.

There is a need to better understand the neuroanatomical correlates of these cognitive tests. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether lower MMSE and SMMSE scores correlated with focal brain volume reduction in older adults. Participants from the GAIT study (n = 207; mean, 70.9 +/- 5.9 years; 57% female; mean MMSE 26.2 +/- 3.9; mean SMMSE 5.1 +/- 1.1) were evaluated using the MMSE and SMMSE and received a 1.5-Tesla MRI scan of the brain. Cortical gray and white matter subvolumes were automatically segmented using Statistical Parametric Mapping. Age, gender, education level, and total intracranial volume were included as potential confounders. We found correlations between the MMSE score and specific cortical regions of the limbic system including the hippocampus, amygdala, cingulate gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus, independently of the diagnostic category (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease or controls). Regarding correlations with the SMMSE score, only one cluster in the left hippocampus was identified, which overlapped with the cluster that was positively correlated with the MMSE score. There were no correlations with the volume of white matter. In conclusion, worse MMSE and SMMSE scores were associated with gray matter atrophy mainly in the limbic system. This finding highlights that atrophy of specific brain regions are related to performance on the MMSE and the SMMSE tests, and provides new insights into the cognitive function probed by these tests.

A docking study Of cyclodal using the crystal structure of MOR in the inactive form showed a unique binding mode with the two basic residues of the ligand forming salt bridges with the Asp(127) and Glu(229) receptor residues. Cyclodal showed high plasma stability and was able to cross the plood, brain barrier to reverse morphine-induced, centrally mediated analgesia when given intravenously. Surprisingly, the mirror-image isomer (optical antipode) of cyclodal, c[-Arg-D-Phe-D-Lys-D-Dmt-] (2), also turned out to be a selective MOR antagonist with 1 nM binding affinity, and thus, these two compounds represent the first example of mirror image opioid receptor ligands with both optical antipodes having high binding affinity. Reduction of the Lys-Dmt peptide bond in cyclodal resulted in an analogue, c[-D-Arg-Phe-Lys Psi[CH2NH]Dmt-] (8) with MOR agonist activity.

Herein, we investigated the actions of insulin using ex vivo and in vivo models of HAND. Increased neuroinflammatory gene expression was observed in brains from patients with HIV/AIDS. The insulin receptor was detected on both neurons and glia, but its expression was unaffected by HIV-1 infection. Insulin treatment of HIV-infected primary human microglia suppressed supernatant HIV-1 p24 levels, reduced CXCL10 and IL-6 transcript levels, and induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) expression. Insulin treatment of primary human neurons prevented HIV-1 Vpr-mediated cell process retraction and death. In feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infected cats, daily intranasal insulin treatment (20.0 IU/200 mu l for 6 weeks) reduced CXCL10, IL-6, and FIV RNA detection in brain, although PPAR-gamma in glia was increased compared with PBS-treated FIV+ control animals. These molecular changes were accompanied by diminished glial activation in cerebral cortex and white matter of insulin-treated FIV+ animals, with associated preservation of cortical neurons. Neuronal counts in parietal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus were higher in the FIV+/insulin-treated group compared with the FIV+/PBS-treated group. Moreover, intranasal insulin treatment improved neurobehavioral performance, including both memory and motor functions, in FIV+ animals. Therefore, insulin exerted ex vivo and in vivo antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in models of HAND, representing a new therapeutic option for patients with inflammatory or infectious neurodegenerative disorders including HAND.

Wee			Evaluating Soluble EMMPRIN as a Marker of Disease Activity in Multiple Sclerosis: Studies of Serum and Cerebrospinal Fluid	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; IMMUNOGLOBULIN SUPERFAMILY; MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EXPRESSION; SURFACE; CD147; INDUCER; BASIGIN; LACTATE	Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN, CD147) is an inducer of matrix metalloproteinases and has roles in leukocyte activation and migration. We reported previously that in MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, cell surface-associated EMMPRIN was significantly elevated in leukocytes around inflammatory perivascular cuffs in the CNS. In this study we report that activated T-cells can secrete soluble form of EMMPRIN (sEMMPRIN) upon activation. As sEMMPRIN is also present in biological fluids, we determined whether sEMMPRIN is altered in the CSF and sera of MS subjects. Sera from individuals without neurological conditions served as controls, while CSFs collected from subjects undergoing discectomy, and without evidence of CNS pathology, were used as a comparator group. We found that serum levels of sEMMPRIN from clinically stable MS patients or other inflammatory conditions did not differ from control subjects. Paired serum and CSF samples demonstrated poor correlation of sEMMPRIN. Interestingly, sEMMPRIN levels were approximately 60% higher in CSFs compared to sera. sEMMPRIN CSF levels were significantly higher in secondary progressive compared to primary progressive subjects. Thus we conclude that measurement of sEMMPRIN in serum is not informative for disease activity in MS. The differential expression of sEMMPRIN in the CSF of primary and secondary progressive MS invites hypotheses of the still undefined roles of EMMPRIN in the CNS.	[Kaushik, Deepak K.; Yong, Heather Y.

We tested whether the sole targeted deletion of the mu opioid receptor gene (Oprm1) alters the brain connectome in living mice. Hypothesis-free analysis of combined resting-state fMRI diffusion tractography showed pronounced modifications of functional connectivity with only minor changes in structural pathways. Fine-grained resting-state fMRI mapping, graph theory, and intergroup comparison revealed Oprm1-specific hubs and captured a unique Oprm1 gene-to-network signature. Strongest perturbations occurred in connectional patterns of pain/aversion-related nodes, including the mu receptor-enriched habenula node. Our data demonstrate that the main receptor for morphine predominantly shapes the so-called reward/aversion circuitry, with major influence on negative affect centers.

Surprisingly, the cerebral substrates supporting this phenomenon have never been examined. We used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of the influence of sleep on interference to motor memory consolidation. Healthy young adults were trained on a sequential motor task, and subsequently practiced a second competing sequence after an interval including diurnal sleep or wakefulness. Participants were then retested on the initial sequence 8 h and 24 h (including nocturnal sleep) after training. Results demonstrated that a post-training nap significantly protected memory against interference at 8 h and modulated the link between cerebral activity and behavior, such that a smaller post-interference decrease in cortico-striatal activity was associated with better performance. Interestingly, the protective effect of a nap was only transitory, as both groups performed similarly at 24 h. Activity in cortico-striatal areas that was disrupted during the day, presumably due to interference and accentuated in the absence of a nap, was restored overnight. Altogether, our findings offer the first evidence that cortico-striatal areas play a critical role in the transient sleep-facilitated reduction in motor memory vulnerability and in the overnight restoration of previously degraded memories.

Determination of EGFR Signaling Output by Opposing Gradients of BMP and JAK/STAT Activity	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							ANTERIOR-POSTERIOR AXIS; EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; DORSAL-VENTRAL PATTERN; DROSOPHILA-OOGENESIS; BROAD-COMPLEX; EPITHELIAL MORPHOGENESIS; NEURAL-TUBE; ACTIVATION; RECEPTOR; EGGSHELL	A relatively small number of signaling pathways drive a wide range of developmental decisions, but how this versatility in signaling outcome is generated is not clear. In the Drosophila follicular epithelium, localized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation induces distinct cell fates depending on its location. Posterior follicle cells respond to EGFR activity by expressing the T-box transcription factors Midline and H15, while anterior cells respond by expressing the homeodomain transcription factor Mirror. We show that the choice between these alternative outputs of EGFR signaling is regulated by antiparallel gradients of JAK/STAT and BMP pathway activity and that mutual repression between Midline/H15 and Mirror generates a bistable switch that toggles between alternative EGFR signaling outcomes. JAK/STAT and BMP pathway input is integrated through their joint and opposing regulation of both sides of this switch. By converting this positional information into a binary decision between EGFR signaling outcomes, this regulatory network ultimately allows the same ligand-receptor pair to establish both the anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes of the tissue.

However, the structural correlates underlying attention remains unexplored. Here, we utilized graph theory to examine the neuroanatomical substrates of the three attention systems measured by attention network test (ANT) in 65 healthy subjects. White matter connectivity, assessed with diffusion tensor imaging deterministic tractography was modeled as a structural network comprising 90 nodes defined by the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template. Linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between topological parameters and the three attentional effects. We found a significant positive correlation between EC function and global efficiency of the whole brain network. At the regional level, node-specific correlations were discovered between regional efficiency and all three ANT components, including dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, thalamus and parahippocampal gyrus for EC, thalamus and inferior parietal gyrus for alerting, and paracentral lobule and inferior occipital gyrus for orienting. Our findings highlight the fundamental architecture of interregional structural connectivity involved in attention and could provide new insights into the anatomical basis underlying human behavior.

The aim of this study was to assess the activity of vinblastine in therapy-naive children.Patients and MethodsPatients < 18 years old with unresectable and/or progressive therapy-naive PLGG were eligible. Vinblastine was administered once per week at a dose of 6 mg/m(2) intravenously over a period of 70 weeks. Vision, quality of life, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) status, and BRAF mutation/fusion status were also determined and correlated with outcome.ResultsFifty-four patients were enrolled onto the study, with a median age of 8 years (range, 0.7 to 17.2 years). Most patients had chiasmatic/hypothalamic tumors (55.5%), and 13 patients (24.1%) had NF1. The most common histology was pilocytic astrocytoma (46.3%). Seventeen patients were diagnosed using radiologic criteria alone. Best response to chemotherapy was centrally reviewed with a response rate (complete, partial, or minor response) of 25.9%. Disease stabilization (complete, partial, or minor response or stable disease) was achieved in 47 patients (87.0%). Visual improvement was observed in 20% of patients with optic pathway glioma. Five-year overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 94.4% (95% CI, 88.5% to 100%) and 53.2% (95% CI, 41.3% to 68.5%), respectively, for the entire cohort. Patients with NF1 had a significantly better PFS (85.1%; 95% CI, 68.0% to 100%) when compared with patients without NF1 (42.0%; 95% CI, 29.1% to 60.7%; P = .012). Age< 3 years or > 10 years was not associated with poor outcome. Treatment was well tolerated, and quality of life was not affected during treatment. In this trial, there was no correlation between BRAF alterations and outcome.ConclusionVinblastine administered once per week is well tolerated in children with treatment naive PLGG. Overall survival and PFS are comparable to current therapies, with a favorable toxicity profile and a maintained quality of life.

Evidence from animal studies suggests similar subtle fluctuations in hippocampal structure, predominantly linked to estrogen. Hippocampal abnormalities have been observed in several neuropsychiatric pathologies with prominent sexual dimorphism. Yet, the potential impact of subtle sex-hormonal fluctuations on human hippocampal structure in health is unclear. We tested the feasibility of longitudinal neuroimaging in conjunction with rigorous menstrual cycle monitoring to evaluate potential changes in hippocampal microstructure associated with physiological sex-hormonal changes. Thirty longitudinal diffusion weighted imaging scans of a single healthy female subject were acquired across two full menstrual cycles. We calculated hippocampal fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure sensitive to changes in microstructural integrity, and investigated potential correlations with estrogen. We observed a significant positive correlation between FA values and estrogen in the hippocampus bilaterally, revealing a peak in FA closely paralleling ovulation. This exploratory, single-subject study demonstrates the feasibility of a longitudinal DWI scanning protocol across the menstrual cycle and is the first to link subtle endogenous hormonal fluctuations to changes in FA in vivo. In light of recent attempts to neurally phenotype single humans, our findings highlight menstrual cycle monitoring in parallel with highly sampled individual neuroimaging data to address fundamental questions about the dynamics of plasticity in the adult brain.

Indeed, more than one third of the patients still die from this disease. Here, we developed a novel approach to improve the current anti-GD2 immunotherapy based on NK cell stimulation using toll-like receptor (TLR)activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). We demonstrated that this strategy led to the efficient killing of NB cells. When the expression of GD2 was heterogeneous on NB cells, the combination of pDC-mediated NK-cell activation and anti-GD2 treatment significantly increased the cytotoxicity of NK cells against NB cells. Activation by pDCs led to a unique NK-cell phenotype characterized by increased surface expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), with increased expression of CD69 on CD56(dim) cytotoxic cells, and strong interferon-gamma production. Additionally, NB-cell killing was mediated by the TRAIL death-receptor pathway, as well as by the release of cytolytic granules via the DNAX accessory molecule 1 pathway. NK-cell activation and lytic activity against NB was independent of cell contact, depended upon type I IFN produced by TLR-9-activated pDCs, but was not reproduced by IFN-alpha stimulation alone. Collectively, these results highlighted the therapeutic potential of activated pDCs for patients with high-risk NB.

Univ Washington Ctr Mendelian	Recurrent De Novo and Biallelic Variation of ATAD3A, Encoding a Mitochondrial Membrane Protein, Results in Distinct Neurological Syndromes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							COPY-NUMBER VARIATION; DOMAIN-CONTAINING 3A; LOSS-OF-FUNCTION; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; OPTIC ATROPHY; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; TRANSMISSION GENETICS; MOLECULAR FINDINGS; GENOMIC DISORDERS; CPG DINUCLEOTIDES	ATPase family AAA-domain containing protein 3A (ATAD3A) is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial membrane protein implicated in mitochondrial dynamics, nucleoid organization, protein translation, cell growth, and cholesterol metabolism. We identified a recurrent de novo ATAD3A c.1582C>T (p.Arg528Trp) variant by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in five unrelated individuals with a core phenotype of global developmental delay, hypotonia, optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We also describe two families with biallelic variants in ATAD3A, including a homozygous variant in two siblings, and biallelic ATAD3A deletions mediated by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between ATAD3A and gene family members ATAD3B and ATAD3C. Tissue-specific over expression of bor(R534W), the Drosophila mutation homologous to the human c.1582C>T (p.Arg528Trp) variant, resulted in a dramatic decrease in mitochondrial content, aberrant mitochondrial morphology, and increased autophagy. Homozygous null bor larvae showed a significant decrease of mitochondria, while overexpression of bor(WT) resulted in larger, elongated mitochondria. Finally, fibroblasts of an affected individual exhibited increased mitophagy. We conclude that the p.Arg528Trp variant functions through a dominant-negative mechanism that results in small mitochondria that trigger mitophagy, resulting in a reduction in mitochondrial content. ATAD3A variation represents an additional link between mitochondrial dynamics and recognizable neurological syndromes, as seen with MFN2, OPA1, DNM1L, and STAT2 mutations.

BDNF Val(66)Met Polymorphism Influences Visuomotor Associative Learning and the Sensitivity to Action Observation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT SECRETION; VISUAL-CORTEX; VAL66MET POLYMORPHISM; MOTOR FACILITATION; MIRROR NEURONS; CRITICAL-PERIOD; PLASTICITY; STIMULATION; INHIBITION; SIMULATION	Motor representations in the human mirror neuron system are tuned to respond to specific observed actions. This ability is widely believed to be influenced by genetic factors, but no study has reported a genetic variant affecting this system so far. One possibility is that genetic variants might interact with visuomotor associative learning to configure the system to respond to novel observed actions. In this perspective, we conducted a candidate gene study on the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val(66)Met polymorphism, a genetic variant linked to motor learning in regions of the mirror neuron system, and tested the effect of this polymorphism on motor facilitation and visuomotor associative learning. In a single-pulse TMS study carried on 16 Met (Val/Met and Met/Met) and 16 Val/Val participants selected from a large pool of healthy volunteers, Met participants showed significantly less muscle-specific corticospinal sensitivity during action observation, as well as reduced visuomotor associative learning, compared to Val homozygotes. These results are the first evidence of a genetic variant tuning sensitivity to action observation and bring to light the importance of considering the intricate relation between genetics and associative learning in order to further understand the origin and function of the human mirror neuron system.

The estimation relies on a macroscopic model of the BOLD effect that balances oxygen delivery and consumption to predict haemoglobin oxygenation and the BOLD signal. The accuracy of calibrated fMRI approaches has not been firmly established, which is limiting their broader adoption. We use our recently developed microscopic vascular anatomical network model in mice as a ground truth simulator to test the accuracy of macroscopic, lumped-parameter BOLD models. In particular, we investigate the original Davis model and a more recent heuristic simplification. We find that these macroscopic models are inaccurate using the originally defined parameters, but that the accuracy can be significantly improved by redefining the model parameters to take on new values. In particular, we find that the parameter a that relates cerebral blood-volume changes to cerebral blood-flow changes is significantly smaller than typically assumed and that the optimal value changes with magnetic field strength. The results are encouraging in that they support the use of simple BOLD models to quantify BOLD signals, but further work is needed to understand the physiological interpretation of the redefined model parameters.

Neuronal networks and mediators of cortical neurovascular coupling responses in normal and altered brain states	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						cerebral blood flow; haemodynamics; neuronal network; local field potential; acetylcholine; noradrenaline	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; RAT SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; STIMULUS-INDUCED CHANGES; BARREL-RELATED COLUMNS; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; BASAL FOREBRAIN; IN-VIVO; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; VISUAL-CORTEX; NUCLEUS BASALIS	Brain imaging techniques that use vascular signals to map changes in neuronal activity, such as blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, rely on the spatial and temporal coupling between changes in neurophysiology and haemodynamics, known as 'neurovascular coupling (NVC)'. Accordingly, NVC responses, mapped by changes in brain haemodynamics, have been validated for different stimuli under physiological conditions. In the cerebral cortex, the networks of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons generating the changes in neural activity and the key mediators that signal to the vascular unit have been identified for some incoming afferent pathways. The neural circuits recruited by whisker glutamatergic-, basal forebrain cholinergic-or locus coeruleus noradrenergic pathway stimulation were found to be highly specific and discriminative, particularly when comparing the two modulatory systems to the sensory response. However, it is largely unknown whether or not NVC is still reliable when brain states are altered or in disease conditions. This lack of knowledge is surprising since brain imaging is broadly used in humans and, ultimately, in conditions that deviate from baseline brain function. Using the whisker-to-barrel pathway as a model of NVC, we can interrogate the reliability of NVC under enhanced cholinergic or noradrenergic modulation of cortical circuits that alters brain states.

The purpose of this study was determining the effects of HL156A, a newly designed biguanide with improved pharmacokinetics, on glioblastoma TSs (GMB TSs) and assess the feasibility of this drug as a new line of therapy against glioblastoma, alone or combined with a conventional therapeutic agent, temozolomide(TMZ). The effects of HL156A, alone and combined with TMZ, on the stemness and invasive properties of GBM TSs and survival of orthotopic xenograft animals were assessed. HL156A, combined with TMZ, inhibited the stemness of GBM TSs, proven by neurosphere formation assay and marker expression. Three-dimensional collagen matrix invasion assays provided evidence that combined treatment inhibited invasive properties, compared with control and TMZ-alone treatment groups. TMZ alone and combined treatment repressed the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes. A gene ontology comparison of TMZ and combination-treatment groups revealed altered expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cellular adhesion and migration. Combined treatment with HL156A and TMZ showed survival benefits in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. The inhibitory effect of combination treatment on the stemness and invasive properties of GBM TSs suggest the potential usage of this regimen as a novel strategy for the treatment of GBM.

We assess the hypothesis that the acoustic properties of [h] may render detection of this segment in the speech stream insufficiently reliable for second language acquisition. We use the mismatch negativity (MMN) in event-related potentials to investigate [h] perception in French speaking learners of English and native English controls, comparing both linguistic and non-linguistic conditions in an unattended oddball paradigm. Unlike native speakers, French learners of English elicit an MMN response only in the non-linguistic condition. Our results provide neurobiological evidence against the hypothesis that French speakers' difficulties with [h] are acoustically based. They instead suggest that the problem is in constructing an appropriate phonological representation for [h] in the interlanguage grammar.

T1 isoform lacking the kinase domain. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) activates TrkC-FL to maintain motor neuron health and function and TrkC. T1 to produce neurotoxic TNF-alpha; hence resulting in opposing pathways. In mouse and human ALS spinal cord, the reduction of miR-128 that destabilizes TrkC. T1 mRNA results in up-regulated TrkC. T1 and TNF-alpha in astrocytes. We exploited conformational differences to develop an agonistic mAb 2B7 that selectively activates TrkC-FL, to circumvent TrkC. T1 activation. In mouse ALS, 2B7 activates spinal cord TrkC-FL signals, improves spinal cord motor neuron phenotype and function, and significantly prolongs life-span. Our results elucidate biological paradoxes of receptor isoforms and their role in disease progression, validate the concept of selectively targeting conformational epitopes in naturally occurring isoforms, and may guide the development of pro-neuroprotective (TrkC-FL) and anti-neurotoxic (TrkC.T1) therapeutic strategies.

Serotonin (5-HT) and other neuroactive compounds deriving from Tryptophan (Trp), including kynurenine (Kyn), have not yet been investigated in large cohorts of aggressive individuals to validate their potential as biomarkers of aggression. In 361 male inmates we measured serum levels of Trp, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HT, Kyn, the ratios 5-HT/Trp (*) 1000 and Kyn/Trp (*) 1000, and performed Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I and -II Disorders (SCID-I and -II), global assessment of functioning (GAF), and scales for aggressive behavior, impulsivity, adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intelligent quotient (IQ). Aggressive compared to non-aggressive inmates exhibited lower Trp and Kyn serum levels but higher levels of 5-HT and 5-HT/Trp (*) 1000, higher levels of impulsivity and ADHD indices, lower IQ and GAF, higher prevalence of mood disorders, drug abuse/dependence, and borderline, conduct and antisocial behaviors. Interestingly, Kyn/Trp (*) 1000 was positively correlated to the number of severe aggressive acts (r = 0.593, P < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, logistic regression analysis indicated that 5-HT/Trp (*) 1000, antisocial behavior, and GAF were predictors of aggressive behavior. The model combining these three predictors had an area under the ROC curve of 0.851 (95% CI 0.806-0.895). This study indicates that while circulating Trp is reduced in aggressive individuals, the combination of biological (5-HT/Trp ratio) and psychopathological (antisocial behavior and GAF) markers discriminates between aggressive and non-aggressive behavior suggesting the potential of a multi-marker approach in psychiatry given the heterogenic nature of mental diseases.

J	Bedard, M; Laplante, L; Mercier, J				Bedard, Melanie; Laplante, Line; Mercier, Julien			Development of Reading Remediation for Dyslexic Individuals Added Benefits of the Joint Consideration of Neurophysiological and Behavioral Data	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PSYCHOLOGIE-JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						reading remediation; dyslexia; educational neuroscience; neurophysiological data; behavioral data	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; PANELS METAANALYSIS; EDUCATION; BRAIN; INSTRUCTION; INTERVENTION; AWARENESS; STUDENTS; READERS; LEARN	Dyslexia is a phenomenon for which the brain correlates have been studied since the beginning of the 20th century. Simultaneously, the field of education has also been studying dyslexia and its remediation, mainly through behavioral data. The last two decades have seen a growing interest in integrating neuroscience and education. This article provides a quick overview of pertinent scientific literature involving neurophysiological data on functional brain differences in dyslexia and discusses their very limited influence on the development of reading remediation for dyslexic individuals. Nevertheless, it appears that if certain conditions are met - related to the key elements of educational neuroscience and to the nature of the research questions - conceivable benefits can be expected from the integration of neurophysiological data with educational research. When neurophysiological data can be employed to overcome the limits of using behavioral data alone, researchers can both unravel phenomenon otherwise impossible to document and raise new questions.

Minimally invasive approach for the treatment of lumbar epidural arteriovenous fistulas with intradural venous reflux	NEUROCHIRURGIE			English	Article						Minimally invasive; Arteriovenous fistula; Draining vein; Microsurgery; Myelopathy	MALFORMATIONS; DRAINAGE; MANIFESTATIONS; VEIN	Background. - Vascular lesions of the spinal cord are increasingly recognized. The most common types of these lesions are dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) whereas, extradural AVFs are a very rare type of spinal AVF and can be associated with either extradural or intradural venous reflux. This results in neurological deficits through congestive or compressive myeloradiculopathy. These lesions must be treated to allow stabilization or improvement of neurologic status, either by endovascular therapy or microsurgical interruption. However, because some patients are not amenable to endovascular treatment, surgery is often warranted, which usually involves hemi- or bilateral laminectomy following a midline approach with bilateral muscle stripping. The main drawback of this procedure is directly related to the morbidity of the approach. Although, minimally invasive approaches are likely to overcome this drawback, there is a lack of reported experience supporting their use for treating spinal dural AVFs. Case presentation. - Two patients, aged 62 and 79 years old, presented with rapidly progressive myelopathy characterized by paraparesis and sphincter disturbance. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging showed spinal cord oedema with perimedullary flow voids in both cases. Digital subtraction angiography revealed extradural AVFs associated with perimedullary venous reflux. Endovascular therapy was not feasible. Both patients were treated with microsurgical interruption of the intradural vein through a non -expendable retractor. Complete exclusion was confirmed on postoperative angiography, resulting in resolution of spinal cord edema and improved neurological functional status at 2-year follow-up. Conclusion. - The minimally invasive surgical treatment of spinal AVFs with epidural venous reflux is safe and effective. This approach is a valuable alternative to endovascular therapy and the standard open microsurgical approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Development and initial validation of the Fear of Guilt Scale for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)	JOURNAL OF OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE AND RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Fear of guilt; Guilt; Validation	DISGUST SENSITIVITY; MENTAL CONTAMINATION; REPEATED CHECKING; EMOTIONAL STATES; MEMORY DISTRUST; RESPONSIBILITY; INVENTORY; ANXIETY; SELF; MANIPULATION	Although people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often report devastating feelings of guilt, to date, a clear link between guilt and OCD symptoms has not been established. Researchers are currently exploring the extent to which individuals with OCD fear the feeling of guilt (e.g., for harm they might have caused, averted, or minimised) and behave compulsively in consequence. However, no self-report measures of the fear of guilt construct exist, which limits our ability to examine its role in OCD. We therefore developed a 17-item Fear of Guilt Scale (FOGS), culled from a larger, 49-item pool following exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, to measure fear of guilt in OCD. Psychometric analyses were conducted across three large, nonclinical undergraduate samples and suggest the FOGS consists of two factors: Punishment (drive to punish oneself for feelings of guilt) and Harm Prevention (drive to proactively prevent guilt). The FOGS demonstrated strong internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity. It also significantly predicted OCD symptom severity over measures of neuroticism, depression, trait guilt, and inflated responsibility beliefs. Thus, fear of guilt, as measured by the FOGS, is an important and distinct construct in understanding OCD. Implications for future use of the scale are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Head ultrasound (HUS) was performed with a 9S4 MHz sector transducer in HIE infants submitted to hypothermia as part of their routine care. Measurements of cerebral perfusion intensity (CPI) with an 11LW4 MHz linear array transducer were performed to obtain static images and DICOM color Doppler videos of the blood flow in the basal ganglia area. Clinical and radiological data were evaluated retrospectively. The video images were analyzed by two radiologists using dedicated software, which allows automatic quantification of color Doppler data from a region of interest (ROI) by dynamically assessing color pixels and flow velocity during the heart cycle. CPI is expressed in cm/sec and is calculated by multiplying the mean velocity of all pixels divided by the area of the ROI. Three videos of 3 seconds each were obtained of the ROI, in the coronal plane, and used to calculate the CPI. Data are presented as mean +/- SEM or median (quartiles). Results: A total of 28 infants were included in this study: 16 male, 12 female. HUS was performed within the first 48 hours of therapeutic hypothermia treatment. CPI values were significantly higher in the seven non-survivors when compared to survivors (0.226 +/- 0.221 vs. 0.111 +/- 0.082 cm/sec; P=0.02). Conclusions: Increased perfusion intensity of the basal ganglia area within the first 48 of therapeutic hypothermia treatment was associated with poor outcome in neonates with HIE.

The characteristic phenotype is disruption of astrocyte function and demyelination of spinal cord, optic nerves, and particular brain regions. In this second of a 2-part article, we present further perspectives regarding the pathogenesis of NMO/SD and how this disease might be amenable to emerging technologies aimed at restoring immune tolerance to disease-implicated self-antigens. NMO/SD appears to be particularly well-suited for these strategies since aquaporin-4 has already been identified as the dominant autoantigen. The recent technical advances in reintroducing immune tolerance in experimental models of disease as well as in humans should encourage quantum leaps in this area that may prove productive for novel therapy. In this part of the article series, the potential for regulatory T and B cells is brought into focus, as are new approaches to oral tolerization. Finally, a road-map is provided to help identify potential issues in clinical development and guide applications in tolerization therapy to solving NMO/SD through the use of emerging technologies. Each of these perspectives is intended to shine new light on potential cures for NMO/SD and other autoimmune diseases, while sparing normal host defense mechanisms.

This process results in a characteristic pattern of astrocyte dysfunction, loss, and demyelination that predominantly affects the spinal cord and optic nerves. Although several empirical therapies are currently used in the treatment of NMO/SD, none has been proven effective in prospective, adequately powered, randomized trials. Furthermore, most of the current therapies subject patients to long-term immunologic suppression that can cause serious infections and development of cancers. The following is the first of a 2-part description of several key immune mechanisms in NMO/SD that might be amenable to therapeutic restoration of immune tolerance. It is intended to provide a roadmap for how potential immune tolerance restorative techniques might be applied to patients with NMO/SD. This initial installment provides a background rationale underlying attempts at immune tolerization. It provides specific examples of innovative approaches that have emerged recently as a consequence of technical advances. In several autoimmune diseases, these strategies have been reduced to practice. Therefore, in theory, the identification of aquaporin-4 as the dominant autoantigen makes NMO/SD an ideal candidate for the development of tolerizing therapies or cures for this increasingly recognized disease.

Furthermore, the interpretation of available data is limited by the fact that the interval from the administration of antenatal corticosteroids to delivery is greater than 7 days in a large proportion of twins, a factor that has been shown to affect the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroids and has not been controlled for in previous studies. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare neonatal mortality and morbidity in preterm twins receiving a complete course of antenatal corticosteroids 1-7 days before birth to those who did not receive antenatal corticosteroids and to compare these outcome effects with those observed in singletons. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study using data collected on singleton and twin neonates born between 24(0/7) and 33(6/7) weeks' gestational age and were admitted to tertiary neonatal units in Canada between 2010 and 2014. A comparison of neonatal outcomes between twin neonates who received a complete course of antenatal corticosteroids 1-7 days before birth (n = 1758) and those who did not receive antenatal corticosteroids (n = 758) and between singleton neonates who received a complete course of antenatal corticosteroids 1-7 days before birth (n = 4638) and those did not receive antenatal corticosteroids (n = 2312) was conducted after adjusting for gestational age, sex, hypertension, outborn status, small for gestational age, parity, and cesarean birth. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for various neonatal outcomes were calculated. RESULTS: Administration of a complete course of antenatal corticosteroids within 1-7 days before birth in both twins and singletons was associated with similar reduced odds of neonatal death (for twins adjusted odds ratio 0.42 [95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.76] and for singletons adjusted odds ratios, 0.38 [95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.50]; P = .7 for comparison of twins vs singletons), mechanical ventilation (for twins adjusted odds ratio, 0.47 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.63] and for singletons adjusted odds ratio, 0.47 [95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.55]; P = .9), respiratory distress syndrome (for twins adjusted odds ratio, 0.53 [95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.69], and for singletons adjusted odds ratio, 0.54 [95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.62]; P = .9) and severe neurological injury (for twins adjusted odds ratio, 0.50 [95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.83] and for singletons adjusted odds ratio, 0.45 [95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.59]; P = .7). Administration of a complete course of antenatal corticosteroids was not associated with a reduced odds of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe retinopathy of prematurity, or necrotizing enterocolitis in both twins and singletons. CONCLUSION: Administration of a complete course of antenatal corticosteroids 1-7 days before birth in twin pregnancies is associated with a clinically significant decrease in neonatal mortality, short-term respiratory morbidity, and severe neurological injury that is similar in magnitude to that observed among singletons.

Long-Term Effects of Postoperative Delirium in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Operation: A Systematic Review	ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY			English	Review							RISK-FACTORS; SURGERY PATIENTS; VALIDATION	Delirium is an acute syndrome that involves fluctuating changes in attention and cognition. Although delirium is the most common neurologic complication after cardiac operation, data about its impact on long-term outcomes are lacking. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effect of postoperative delirium (PoD) on long-term outcomes, including morbidity, probability of death, cognitive decline, institutionalization, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients undergoing cardiac operation. After performing this systematic review we determined that PoD after cardiac operation is associated with an increased risk of probability of death and readmission to the hospital and a decrease in cognitive function, overall function, and HRQoL.

Motor unit number and transmission stability in octogenarian world class athletes: Can age-related deficits be outrun?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						aging; physical activity; muscle function; master athletes; electromyography; sarcopenia; dynapenia	DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; TIBIALIS ANTERIOR; HUMAN MUSCLE; MOTONEURONS; MEN; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; DECOMPOSITION; VARIABILITY; DISCHARGES; ACTIVATION	Our group has shown a greater number of functioning motor units (MU) in a cohort of highly active older (similar to 65 yr) masters runners relative to age-matched controls. Because of the precipitous loss in the number of functioning MUs in the eighth and ninth decades of life it is unknown whether older world class octogenarian masters athletes (MA) would also have greater numbers of functioning MUs compared with age-matched controls. We measured MU numbers and neuromuscular transmission stability in the tibialis anterior of world champion MAs (similar to 80 yr) and compared the values with healthy age-matched controls (similar to 80 yr). Decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered averaging was used to collect surface and intramuscular electromyography signals during dorsiflexion at similar to 25% of maximum voluntary isometric contraction. Near fiber (NF) MU potential analysis was used to assess neuromuscular transmission stability. For the MAs compared with age-matched controls, the amount of excitable muscle mass (compound muscle action potential) was 14% greater (P < 0.05), there was a trend (P = 0.07) toward a 27% smaller surface-detected MU potential representative of less collateral reinnervation, and 28% more functioning MUs (P < 0.05). Additionally, the MAs had greater MU neuromuscular stability than the controls, as indicated by lower NF jitter and jiggle values (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that high-performing octogenarians better maintain neuromuscular stability of the MU and mitigate the loss of MUs associated with aging well into the later decades of life during which time the loss of muscle mass and strength becomes functionally relevant. Future studies may identify the concomitant roles genetics and exercise play in neuro-protection.

Comprehensive analysis of the clinical and urodynamic outcomes of primary tethered spinal cord before and after spinal cord untethering	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGY			English	Article						Urinary bladder; Neural tube defect; Spinal dysraphism; Tethered spinal cord syndrome; Urodynamics	NEAR-TOTAL RESECTION; CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT; RADICAL RECONSTRUCTION; NEURAL PLACODE; LIPOMAS; CHILDREN; SYMPTOMS; CONUS	Introduction Primary tethered spinal cord (TSC) refers to a group of abnormalities associated with a posterior bony spinal defect that develops beneath an intact dermis and epidermis. There is relative agreement that patients with symptomatic TSC will require surgical intervention. However, it is still debatable as to how to approach asymptomatic patients with primary TSC. Objective To study the clinical and urodynamic (UDS) outcomes of patients with primary TSC after spinal cord untethering (SCU). Study design Charts of patients with primary TSC between 1998 and 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients that underwent before and after SCU clinical and UDS evaluation with minimum of 5-years follow-up were included. Continence status was assessed in children >= 5 years. Patients with dry intervals of >= 4 h were considered continent. Urologic and neuro-orthopedic manifestations, as well as UDS parameters, were compared before and after SCU. Categorical data were compared using Fisher-Exact test and continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon-Signed-Rank test. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results Twenty-two patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age at time of SCU was 11.5 months (range 3-211). The median age at time of follow-up UDS after SCU was 22 months (range 9-218). The median age at time of last follow-up was 153.5 months (range 65-228). The median follow-up time was 71 months (range 60-192). A total of 14/22 patients had clinical manifestation before SCU, while 8/22 were asymptomatic and diagnosed based on magnetic resonance imaging/UDS findings. Of the symptomatic patients, 86% had symptom improvement after SCU. The UDS parameters showed statistically significant improvement in the median percentage of change of actual bladder capacity (P=0.01), median intravesical pressure for patients with pre-operative pressure >= 40 cm/H2O at total cystometric bladder capacity (P = 0.012), and median bladder compliance at 75% bladder capacity (P = 0.01) (Table). Discussion Tethered spinal cord syndrome (TSCS) is a clinical entity that presents with neurological, urological, and/or orthopedic symptoms caused by primary or secondary tethering of the spinal cord, which may result in ischemic damage of the neural tissue and symptom development. While some authors believe that surgical management should be reserved for symptomatic patients, others prefer prophylactic surgery to avoid possible irreversible neurological damage. The present study provides detailed discussion of the clinical and UDS outcomes for patients with primary TSC that underwent SCU. Conclusion For patients with primary TSC, spinal cord untethering is beneficial in terms of clinical and UDS outcomes. A prospective long-term study with large numbers could further highlight outcomes for this particular group of patients.

Altered fine motor function at school age in Inuit children exposed to PCBs, methylmercury, and lead	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Contaminants; Lead; Mercury; Neurotoxicity; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Postnatal	IN-UTERO EXPOSURE; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; POSTNATAL EXPOSURE; COGNITIVE DEFICIT; FISH CONSUMPTION; EARLY-CHILDHOOD	Background: Motor deficits have frequently been reported in methylmercury (MeHg) poisoning in adults. However, whether exposure to neurotoxic contaminants from environmental sources early in life is associated with neuromotor impairments has received relatively little attention. This study examines the relation of developmental exposure to MeHg, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and lead to motor function in school-age Inuit children exposed through their traditional diet. Methods: In a prospective study in Nunavik, children (mean age = 11.3 years) were assessed on a battery of fine motor tasks, namely the Stanford-Binet Copying subtest (N = 262), the Santa Ana Form Board, and the Finger Tapping Test (N = 215). The relation of mercury (Hg; as an index of MeHg exposure), PCB congener 153 (PCB153), and lead concentrations in cord and current blood samples to task performance was examined using linear regression analyses. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders and control for the other contaminants, higher current PCB concentrations were associated with poorer Santa Ana Form Board and Finger Tapping performance. Results were virtually identical when PCB153 was replaced by other PCB congeners. Higher current Hg levels were independently associated with poorer Finger Tapping performance. Conclusions: This is the first prospective longitudinal study in children to provide evidence of neuromotor impairments associated with postnatal exposure to seafood contaminants from environmental sources. Fine motor speed appears particularly sensitive to the effects of postnatal PCB exposure, which is unusually high in this population. Results with postnatal MeHg are concordant with previous cross-sectional studies with children and adults. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A meta-analytic review of the correlation between peripheral oxytocin and cortisol concentrations	FRONTIERS IN NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						Oxytocin; Cortisol; Plasma; Meta-Analysis; Experimental Manipulation; Stress	PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; PLASMA OXYTOCIN; NEUROENDOCRINE RESPONSES; PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; MAJOR DEPRESSION; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; BRAIN OXYTOCIN; VASOPRESSIN	The stress dampening effects of exogenous oxytocin in humans have been well documented. However, the relation between endogenous oxytocin and cortisol is poorly understood. We conducted a meta analysis on the correlation between oxytocin and cortisol levels measured at baseline (k = 24, N = 739). The effect size for the baseline correlation statistic was small (Pearson r = 0.163, p = 0.008), with high heterogeneity (I-2 = 67.88%). Moderation analysis revealed that studies where participants anticipated an experimental manipulation evidenced a greater positive correlation compared to those that did not (Pearson r = 0.318, p = 0.006). A supplementary analysis including additional studies indicated that oxytocin levels in unextracted samples were 60 times higher when using this questionable practice. The findings suggest that the interplay between oxytocin and cortisol is dynamic and sensitive to the anticipation of stress or novelty. Furthermore, extraction of oxytocin appears to be an essential methodological practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery would be decreased in newborns with congenital heart disease compared with controls. Methods: Using a "feed-and-sleep'' approach to performing neonatal magnetic resonance imaging, we measured cerebral blood flow by using a slice prescription perpendicular to the right and left internal carotid arteries and basilar artery at the level of the clivus. We calculated brain volume by segmenting a 3-dimensional steady-state free procession acquisition of the whole brain, allowing quantification of cerebral blood flow indexed to brain volume. Cerebral oxygen delivery was calculated as the product of cerebral blood flow and preductal systemic arterial oxygen content obtained via a combination of conventional pulse oximetry and laboratory analysis of venous blood samples for hemoglobin concentration. Results: A complete set of measurements were obtained in 32 newborns with heart disease and 31 controls. There was no difference in gestational age between the heart disease and control groups. There was no difference in cerebral blood flow compared with controls (103.5 +/- 34.0 vs 119.7 +/- 40.4 mL/min), whereas cerebral oxygen delivery was significantly lower in the congenital heart disease subjects (1881 +/- 625.7 vs 2712 +/- 915.7 mL(O2)/min). Ten newborns with congenital heart disease had diffuse excessive high signal intensity in their white matter and 2 had white matter injury whereas another 5 had both. Conclusions: Newborns with unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease have decreased cerebral oxygen delivery due to arterial desaturation. If brain growth and development are adversely affected through oxygen conformance, our findings could have clinical implications in terms of timing of surgical repair.

Human amygdala activation during rapid eye movements of rapid eye movement sleep: an intracranial study	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						Gamma activity; limbic system; stereo EEG; saccades	HUMAN REM-SLEEP; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PONTOGENICULOOCCIPITAL WAVES; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FEAR; EMOTION; MICROINJECTION; NEUROSCIENCE; ENHANCEMENT	The amygdaloid complex plays a crucial role in processing emotional signals and in the formation of emotional memories. Neuroimaging studies have shown human amygdala activation during rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Stereotactically implanted electrodes for presurgical evaluation in epileptic patients provide a unique opportunity to directly record amygdala activity. The present study analysed amygdala activity associated with REM sleep eye movements on the millisecond scale. We propose that phasic activation associated with rapid eye movements may provide the amygdala with endogenous excitation during REM sleep. Standard polysomnography and stereoelectroencephalograph (SEEG) were recorded simultaneously during spontaneous sleep in the left amygdala of four patients. Time-frequency analysis and absolute power of gamma activity were obtained for 250 ms time windows preceding and following eye movement onset in REM sleep, and in spontaneous waking eye movements in the dark. Absolute power of the 44-48 Hz band increased significantly during the 250 ms time window after REM sleep rapid eye movements onset, but not during waking eye movements. Transient activation of the amygdala provides physiological support for the proposed participation of the amygdala in emotional expression, in the emotional content of dreams and for the reactivation and consolidation of emotional memories during REM sleep, as well as for next-day emotional regulation, and its possible role in the bidirectional interaction between REM sleep and such sleep disorders as nightmares, anxiety and post-traumatic sleep disorder. These results provide unique, direct evidence of increased activation of the human amygdala time-locked to REM sleep rapid eye movements.

Although the pathophysiology of pain is well described and the profound impact of dermatological pain on patients' quality of life is well appreciated, there is an identified need for clear therapeutic plans for providing symptomatic pain relief of common painful dermatoses. In this paper, we will review and clearly outline approaches to pain management of a number of common painful dermatoses such as herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia, ulcers, oral dermatoses, dysesthesias, and many others.

The antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 contributes to the protective effect of mild thermotolerance (40 degrees C) against heat shock-induced apoptosis	FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Apoptosis; Thermotolerance; Nrf2; Oxidative stress; Heat shock; p53	OXIDATIVE STRESS; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; FLUORESCENT-PROBES; KEAP1-NRF2 SYSTEM; REACTIVE OXYGEN; UP-REGULATION; LIVING CELLS; HYPERTHERMIA	The exposure of cells to low doses of stress induces adaptive survival responses that protect cells against subsequent exposure to toxic stress. The ability of cells to resist subsequent toxic stress following exposure to low dose heat stress at 40 degrees C is known as mild thermotolerance. Mild thermotolerance involves increased expression of heat shock proteins and antioxidants, but the initiating factors in this response are not understood. This study aims to understand the role of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway in acquisition of mild thermotolerance at 40 degrees C, and secondly, whether the Nrf2 pathway could be involved in the protective effect of thermotolerance against heat-shock (42 degrees C)-induced apoptosis. During cell preconditioning at 40 degrees C, protein expression of the Nrf2 transcription factor increased after 15-60 min. In addition, levels of the Nrf2 targets MnSOD, catalase, heme oxygenase-1, glutamate cysteine ligase and Hsp70 increased at 40 degrees C. Levels of these Nrf2 targets were enhanced by Nrf2 activator oltipraz and decreased by shRNA targeting Nrf2. Levels of pro-oxidants increased after 30-60 min at 40 degrees C. Pro-oxidant levels were decreased by oltipraz and increased by knockdown of Nrf2. Increased Nrf2 expression and catalase activity at 40 degrees C were inhibited by the antioxidant PEG-catalase and by p53 inhibitor pifithrin-oc. These results suggest that mild thermotolerance (40 degrees C) increases cellular pro-oxidant levels, which in turn activate Nrf2 and its target genes. Moreover, Nrf2 contributes to the protective effect of thermotolerance against heat-shock (42 degrees C)-induced apoptosis, because Nrf2 activation by oltipraz enhanced thermotolerance, whereas Nrf2 knockdown partly reversed thermotolerance. Improved knowledge about the different protective mechanisms that mild thermotolerance can activate is crucial for the potential use of this adaptive survival response to treat stress-related diseases.

However, how visual deprivation impacts on the development of arithmetic processing remains poorly understood. We compared the performances of early (EB), late blind (LB) and sighted control (SC) individuals during various arithmetic tasks involving addition, subtraction and multiplication of various complexities. We also assessed working memory (WM) performances to determine if they relate to a blind person's arithmetic capacities. Results showed that EB participants performed better than LB and SC in arithmetic tasks, especially in conditions in which verbal routines and WM abilities are needed. Moreover, EB participants also showed higher WM abilities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the absence of developmental vision does not prevent the development of refined arithmetic skills and can even trigger the refinement of these abilities in specific tasks.

Uncovering cortico-striatal correlates of cognitive fatigue in pediatric acquired brain disorder: Evidence from traumatic brain injury	CORTEX			English	Article						Cognitive fatigue; Pediatrics; Brain injuries; Neurobiology; Magnetic resonance imaging	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; WEIGHTED IMAGING SWI; BASAL GANGLIA; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; HEAD-INJURY; POSTSTROKE FATIGUE; MENTAL FATIGUE; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FRONTAL-CORTEX	Cognitive fatigue is among the most profound and disabling sequelae of pediatric acquired brain disorders, however the neural correlates of these symptoms in children remains unexplored. One hypothesis suggests that cognitive fatigue may arise from dysfunction of cortico-striatal networks (CSNs) implicated in effort output and outcome valuation. Using pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a model, this study investigated (i) the sub-acute effect of brain injury on CSN volume; and (ii) potential relationships between cognitive fatigue and sub-acute volumetric abnormalities of the CSN. 3D T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences were acquired sub-acutely in 137 children (TBI: n = 103; typically developing - TD children: n = 34). 67 of the original 137 participants (49%) completed measures of cognitive fatigue and psychological functioning at 24-months post injury. Results showed that compared to TD controls and children with milder injuries, children with severe TBI showed volumetric reductions in the overall CSN package, as well as regional gray matter volumetric change in cortical and subcortical regions of the CSN. Significantly greater cognitive fatigue in the TBI patients was associated with volumetric reductions in the CSN and its putative hub regions, even after adjusting for injury severity, socioeconomic status (SES) and depression. In the first study to evaluate prospective neuroanatomical correlates of cognitive fatigue in pediatric acquired brain disorder, these findings suggest that post-injury cognitive fatigue is related to structural abnormalities of cortico-striatal brain networks implicated in effort output and outcome valuation. Morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may have potential to unlock early prognostic markers that may assist to identify children at elevated risk for cognitive fatigue post-TBI.

Accordingly, models of gaze shift control should embed both saccadic and fixation modes and a mechanism for switching between them. We demonstrate a model in which the eye and head platforms are driven by a shared gaze error signal. To limit the number of free parameters, we implement a model reduction approach in which steady-state cerebellar effects at each of their projection sites are lumped with the parameter of that site. The model topology is consistent with anatomy and neurophysiology, and can replicate eye-head responses observed in multiple experimental contexts: 1) observed gaze characteristics across species and subjects can emerge from this structure with minor parametric changes; 2) gaze can move to a goal while in the fixation mode; 3) ocular compensation for head perturbations during saccades could rely on vestibular-only cells in the vestibular nuclei with postulated projections to burst neurons; 4) two nonlinearities suffice, i.e., the experimentally-determined mapping of tectoreticular cells onto brain stem targets and the increased recruitment of the head for larger target eccentricities; 5) the effects of initial conditions on eye/head trajectories are due to neural circuit dynamics, not planning; and 6) "compensatory" ocular slow phases exist even after semicircular canal plugging, because of interconnections linking eye-head circuits. Our model structure also simulates classical vestibulo-ocular reflex and pursuit nystagmus, and provides novel neural circuit and behavioral predictions, notably that both eye-head coordination and segmental limb coordination are possible without trajectory planning.

Assessing patients QoL with valid instruments and gathering knowledge about the determinants that affect QoL in individuals with PD are the basis of an efficient caring strategy. In addition to the known motor symptoms, nonmotor disorders must also be comprehensively tracked and targeted for treatment to enhance QoL. A holistic strategy to maintain QoL in people with PD should consist of a multidisciplinary, personalized and patient-centered approach with timely administration of palliative care and efficient involvement of caregivers and family members.

Particularly elusive is the role of the left ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a region implicated in semantic control generally. Although fMRI studies have shown that the left VLPFC is active during idiom processing (see Rapp et al. (2012), for review), rTMS studies have failed to corroborate a clear role of this prefrontal region (e.g., Oliveri et al., 2004). We investigated this issue using a semantic meaningfulness judgment task that compared idiom comprehension following rTMS-stimulation to the left VLPFC relative to a control site (vertex). We also investigated whether individual differences in general cognitive capacity among comprehenders modulated the effects of rTMS. The results indicate that left VLPFC stimulation particularly affected the processing of low-familiar idioms, possibly because these items involve a maximal semantic conflict between a salient literal and less-known figurative meaning. Of note, this pattern only emerged for comprehenders with higher cognitive control capacity, possibly because they were more likely to activate or maintain multiple semantic representations during idiom processing, which required VLPFC integrity. Taken together, the results support the importance of the left VLPFC to idiom processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the neurodevelopmental theory of SCZ cannot solely explain progressive neurodegenerative processes in the illness. There is evidence of accelerated cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia in elderly patients with SCZ. Investigating beta-amyloid (A beta), we conducted a systematic review focusing on A beta in patients with SCZ. An OVID literature search using PsychINFO, Medline, and Embase databases was conducted, looking for studies that compared A beta levels between patients with SCZ and either elderly control subjects, patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), or patients with other psychiatric illnesses. Among 14 identified studies, 11 compared A beta between SCZ and elderly control subjects, 7 between SCZ and AD, and 3 between SCZ and other psychiatric illnesses. As a result, no evidence was found suggesting that A beta levels differ in patients with SCZ from elderly control subjects or patients with other psychiatric illnesses. All seven studies reported lower cortical A beta in patients with SCZ than patients with AD. Furthermore, three of the four studies, which investigated the relationship between A beta and cognitive impairment in SCZ, observed no association between two factors. The limitations of the included studies are small sample sizes, the inclusion of cerebrospinal fluid A beta or postmortem plaques rather than cortical A beta assessment in vivo, and the investigation of different brain regions. In conclusion, A beta deposition is not associated with cognitive decline in late-life SCZ. Future studies should investigate other neurodegenerative indicators in SCZ to better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this illness.

Progression pattern and adverse events with bevacizumab in glioblastoma	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Glioblastoma multiforme; bevacizumab; patterns of progression; adverse events; survival	PHASE-II TRIAL; RECURRENT GLIOBLASTOMA; MALIGNANT GLIOMAS; PLUS IRINOTECAN; FREE SURVIVAL; TEMOZOLOMIDE; MULTIFORME; THERAPY	Background The use of bevacizumab in the management of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains controversial. In Canada, bevacizumab is approved for the treatment of recurrent GBM. We describe a pattern of progression across treatment lines in GBM. Methods During 2008-2014, 64 patients diagnosed with GBM were treated with bevacizumab at McGill University hospitals. Of those patients, 30 (46.9%) received bevacizumab in the first line (B1L), and 34 (53.1%) received it in the second line and beyond (B2L+). The average length of treatment with bevacizumab was 24.4 weeks (range: 0-232.7 weeks). The patterns of progression were categorized as local, distant, diffuse, multifocal, or multi-pattern. Results Local progression was seen in 46.7% of B1L patients and 26.5% of B2L+ patients, distant in 3.3% and 2.9%, diffuse in 20% and 47%, multifocal in 10% and 8.8%, and multi-pattern in 3.3% and 11.8%. No differences between the groups were observed for the distant (p = 0.3) or diffuse (p = 0.4) patterns. Grades 3 and 4 adverse events in the B1L and B2L+ groups were fatigue (33.3% vs. 17.6% respectively), hypertension (26.7% vs. 5.9%), thrombocytopenia (26.7% vs. 11.8%), neutropenia (26.7% vs. 11.8%), anemia (23.3% vs. 11.8%), leucopenia (20% vs. 8.8%), deep vein thrombosis (23.3% vs. 5.9%), seizure (16.7% vs. 8.8%), brain hemorrhage (6.7% vs. <1%), and delayed wound healing (6.7% vs. 2.9%). More total grades 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in the B1L group (p = 0.000519). Conclusions In our cohort, patterns of progression were not different in B1L and B2L+ patients. Moreover, both groups experienced similar adverse events, although more grades 3 and 4 events occurred in the B1L group, implying that severe adverse events in B1L patients could negatively affect survival outcomes.

Analytic advances have allowed for brain connectivity to be represented and quantified at multiple levels: from single connections to communities and networks. This review traces the trajectory of network neuroscience, focusing on how connectivity patterns can be related to cognition and behavior. As recent initiatives for open science provide access to imaging and phenotypic data with great detail and depth, we argue that approaches capable of directly modeling multivariate relationships between brain and behavior will become increasingly important in the field.

Defending the mitochondria: The pathways of mitophagy and mitochondrial-derived vesicles	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY			English	Review						Parkin; PINK1; Mitophagy; Mitochondrial-derived vesicles; Mitochondrial quality control	UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE; PARKIN-MEDIATED MITOPHAGY; INDUCE MITOPHAGY; KINASE 1; PINK1-DEPENDENT PHOSPHORYLATION; PINK1/PARKIN-MEDIATED MITOPHAGY; DAMAGED MITOCHONDRIA; PROTEOLYTIC CLEAVAGE; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; ACTIVATE PARKIN	Mitochondria are the powerhouses for the cell, consuming oxygen to generate sufficient energy for the maintenance of normal cellular processes. However, a deleterious consequence of this process are reactive oxygen species generated as side-products of these reactions. As a means to protect mitochondria from damage, cells and mitochondria have developed a wide-range of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that remove damaged mitochondrial cargo, enabling the mitochondria to repair the damage and ultimately restore their normal function. If the damage is extensive and mitochondria can no longer be repaired, a process termed mitophagy is initiated in which the mitochondria are directed for autophagic clearance. Canonical mitophagy is regulated by two proteins, PINK1 and Parkin, which are mutated in familial forms of Parkinson's disease. In this review, we discuss recent work elucidating the mechanism of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, along with recently uncovered PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy pathways. Moreover, we describe a novel mitochondrial quality control pathway, involving mitochondrial-derived vesicles that direct distinct and damaged mitochondrial cargo for degradation in the lysosome. Finally, we discuss the association between mitochondrial quality control, cardiac, hepatic and neurodegenerative disease and discuss the possibility of targeting these pathways for therapeutic purposes.

We compared the training of senior fellows in a Canadian and a Kenyan pediatric surgery training program, and evaluated a fellow exchange between the programs. Methods: The study was performed six years after creation of the exchange program. Areas studied included case volume and distribution, length of training, curriculum, work hours, and an estimate of service to education ratio. Perceived strengths and challenges of the exchange were investigated using questionnaires. Results: Fellows at each site performed approximately 450 cases/year. Significant differences in case distribution were noted, with plastic surgery, urology and neurosurgery procedures being significantly more frequent in the Kenyan center, and neonatal, minimally invasive, and vascular access procedures being significantly more frequent in the Canadian center. All participants identified educational value in the exchange, although logistical challenges were significant. Conclusion: Differences exist in the training experiences of pediatric surgical fellows in Canada and Kenya, reflecting the differences in health care environment, education, and surgical practice in the two countries. The exchange program of pediatric surgical fellows tapped into this rich diversity and may be applicable to other medical and surgical specialty training programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Mindful interventions: Youth, poverty, and the developing brain	THEORY & PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						children at-risk; education; meditation; mindfulness; neuroscience	MEDITATION; ADOLESCENT; EDUCATION	Mindfulness meditation is being advocated as a promising new educational, clinical, and social intervention for youth, fueled by new evidence from neuroscience about the benefits of growing the brain through meditation, convergent with recent data on developmental neuroplasticity. Although still marginal and in some cases controversial, secular programs of mindfulness have been implemented with ambitious goals of improving attentional focus of pupils, social-emotional learning in at-risk children and youth and, not least, to intervene in problems of poverty and incarceration. In this article, we present insights from an ongoing study involving teachers and mentors working with young people using mindfulness education from an emerging project on the social and cultural contexts of neuroeducation. Our analysis points to the role of neuroscience in positioning these programs as legitimate and progressive, based on state-of-the-art science. We discuss the tensions arising from their moral reframing of social problems associated with poverty and inequality.

One way PMv can carry out this function is by modulating the outputs of the primary motor cortex (M1) to intrinsic hand and forearm muscles. As many PMv neurons discharge when grasping with either arm, both PMv within the same hemisphere (ipsilateral; iPMv) and in the opposite hemisphere (contralateral; cPMv) could modulate M1 outputs. Our objective was to compare modulatory effects of iPMv and cPMv on M1 outputs to intrinsic hand and forearm muscles. We used paired-pulse protocols with intracortical microstimulations in capuchin monkeys. A conditioning stimulus was applied in either iPMv or cPMv simultaneously or prior to a test stimulus in M1 and the effects quantified in electromyographic signals. Modulatory effects from iPMv were predominantly facilitatory, and facilitation was much more common and powerful on intrinsic hand than forearm muscles. In contrast, while the conditioning of cPMv could elicit facilitatory effects, in particular to intrinsic hand muscles, it was much more likely to inhibit M1 outputs. These data show that iPMv and cPMv have very different modulatory effects on the outputs of M1 to intrinsic hand and forearm muscles.

Exploiting artificial neural networks, we also develop a power-efficient DE correction mechanism that properly accounts for anisotropic signal attenuation. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms most representative range-free localization algorithms, not only in accuracy but also in robustness against anisotropic attenuation.

Given VKAs are commonly used oral anticoagulants in older persons, we investigated the relationship between VKA therapy and cognitive performances over 10 years in participants of the Three-City study. The Three-City cohort included 7,133 nondemented community dwellers, aged 65 years or older at baseline. Exposures to VKAs and platelet aggregation inhibitors, another antithrombotic agent, were determined at baseline. Participants underwent cognitive assessment at baseline and every 2 years over 10 years. Associations were analyzed with mixed linear models adjusting for many covariates including VKA and platelet aggregation inhibitor indications. About 239 (3.4%) and 1,192 (16.7%) of the participants were treated with VKAs and platelet aggregation inhibitors at baseline, respectively. VKA treatment was significantly associated with worse performances on Benton Visual Retention Test assessing visual memory (adjusted mean difference -0.29; p = .02 in multivariate models) and Isaacs Set Test assessing verbal fluency (adjusted mean difference -1.37; p = .0009) at baseline. Treatment with VKAs was not associated with global cognitive functioning on the Mini Mental State Examination, neither with rate of subsequent decline in scores on all three cognitive tests. No associations were found between platelet aggregation inhibitors and cognitive performances or rate of decline. These findings do not indicate a long-term detrimental effect of VKAs on cognition, but the risk-benefit balance of VKA treatment still deserves further research.

Effects of topical combinations of clonidine and pentoxifylline on capsaicin-induced allodynia and postcapsaicin tourniquet-induced pain in healthy volunteers: a double-blind, randomized, controlled study	PAIN			English	Article						Capsaicin; Tourniquet-induced pain; Combination therapy; Clonidine; Pentoxifylline; Dynamic mechanical allodynia; Punctate mechanical allodynia; Topical treatment; Neuropathic pain	NEUROPATHIC PAIN; INTRADERMAL CAPSAICIN; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; MICROVASCULAR DYSFUNCTION; HYPERALGESIA; INJECTION; PLACEBO; MODELS; MECHANISMS; MANAGEMENT	This double-blind randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate the analgesic effects of topical treatments with clonidine (CLON) and pentoxifylline (PTX) tested alone or as low-and high-dose combinations in a human experimental model of pain. Of 69 healthy subjects aged 18 to 60 years, 23 each were randomly allocated to low-dose (0.04%-12%) and high-dose (0.1%+15%) CLON +PTX groups. Both of these groups also received their corresponding placebos in one of 2 treatment periods separated by at least 48 hours. Twenty-three additional subjects received either CLON (0.1%) or PTX (5%) as single drug treatments, in each of 2 treatment periods. Assessment of analgesic efficacy was based on allodynic effects of previous intraepidermal capsaicin injection, as well as postcapsaicin tourniquet-induced pain 50 minutes following capsaicin injection. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ratings of pain intensity and the area of dynamic mechanical allodynia were the primary outcome measures, whereas area of punctate mechanical allodynia (PMA) served as a secondary outcome measure. Topical treatments with high-or low-dose combinations significantly reduced VAS ratings compared with corresponding placebo treatments throughout the period of postcapsaicin tourniquet-induced pain. Importantly, the high-dose combination produced lower VAS ratings than CLON alone, which were lower than PTX alone. Results also revealed significant inhibition of postcapsaicin dynamic mechanical allodynia and PMA for the high-dose combination compared with placebo, and of PMA for CLON compared with the low-dose combination. Hence, the present data are supportive of further clinical investigation of the high-dose topical combination of CLON +PTX in complex regional pain syndrome and neuropathic pain patients, for which our preclinical data predict efficacy.

However, the understanding of mechanisms underlying immediate and long-term neurophysiological changes due to exercise is currently incomplete due to the lack of tools to investigate brain function during physical activity. In this study, we used time-domain near infrared spectroscopy (TD-NIRS) to quantify and discriminate extra-cerebral and cerebral hemoglobin concentrations and oxygen saturation (SO2) in young adults at rest and during incremental intensity exercise. In extra-cerebral tissue, an increase in deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) and a decrease in SO2 were observed while only cerebral HbR increased at high intensity exercise. Results in extra-cerebral tissue are consistent with thermoregulatory mechanisms to dissipate excess heat through skin blood flow, while cerebral changes are in agreement with cerebral blood flow (CBF) redistribution mechanisms to meet oxygen demand in activated regions during exercise. No significant difference was observed in oxy-(HbO(2)) and total hemoglobin (HbT). In addition HbO(2), HbR and HbT increased with subject's peak power output (equivalent to the maximum oxygen volume consumption; VO2 peak) supporting previous observations of increased total mass of red blood cells in trained individuals. Our results also revealed known gender differences with higher hemoglobin in men. Our approach in quantifying both extra-cerebral and cerebral absolute hemoglobin during exercise may help to better interpret past and future continuous-wave NIRS studies that are prone to extra-cerebral contamination and allow a better understanding of acute cerebral changes due to physical exercise.

The optimal input parameters of the model were selected on the basis of the performance of models built with different combinations of input variables. To verify the model performances, the trained models were applied to field monitoring data from Lake Champlain. Prediction accuracy was measured by using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). The R-2 values of the best-performed model in the training set, validation set, testing set, and all-year data were 0.82, 0.93, 0.81, and 0.87, respectively. The corresponding RSR values of the three data sets and all-year were 0.62, 0.38, 0.53, and 0.48, respectively. Results indicated that the developed BPANN model can predict chlorophyll-a concentrations in Lake Champlain with high accuracy and provide a quick assessment of chlorophyll-a variation for lake management and eco-restoration.

Pain hypersensitivity in congenital blindness is associated with faster central processing of C-fibre input	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							EVOKED BRAIN POTENTIALS; SPATIAL SUMMATION; WARM FIBERS; HUMAN-SKIN; INCREMENTAL CHANGES; VISUAL DEPRIVATION; DIFFUSION-MODEL; THERMAL PAIN; HEAT PAIN; PERCEPTION	BackgroundWe have recently shown that visual deprivation from birth exacerbates responses to painful thermal stimuli. However, the mechanisms underlying pain hypersensitivity in congenital blindness are unclear. MethodsTo study the contribution of A- and C-fibres in pain perception, we measured thresholds and response times to selective C- and A-fibre activation in congenitally blind, late blind and normally sighted participants. Ultrafast constant-temperature heat pulses were delivered to the hand with a CO2 laser using an interleaved adaptive double staircase procedure. Participants were instructed to respond asquickly as possible when detecting a laser-induced sensation. We useda650ms cut-off criterion to distinguish fast A- from slow C-fibre-mediated sensations. ResultsCongenitally blind participants showed significantly faster reaction times to C- but not to A-fibre-mediated sensations. In contrast, thresholds for A- and C-fibre stimulation did not differ between groups. Late blind individuals did not differ from sighted controls in any aspect. A follow-up experiment using only suprathreshold stimuli for A- and C-fibre activation confirmed these findings and further showed that congenitally blind individuals detected significantly more C-fibre-mediated stimuli than sighted controls. A decomposition analysis of the reaction times indicated that the faster response times in the congenitally blind are due to more efficient central processing of C-fibre-mediated sensations. ConclusionThe increased sensitivity to painful thermal stimulation in congenital blindness may be due to more efficient central processing of C-fibre-mediated input, which may help to avoid impending dangerous encounters with stimuli that threaten the bodily integrity. What does this study add? Hypersensitivity to heat pain in congenital blindness is associated with faster responses to C-fibre activation, likely caused by more efficient central processing of C-fibre-mediated input.

The Effect of Gene Alterations and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition on Survival and Cause of Death in Patients With Adenocarcinoma of the Lung and Brain Metastases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ASTRO Meeting	NOV 13, 2015	San Diego, CA	ASTRO			RADIATION-THERAPY; STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; SINGLE METASTASES; PHASE-3 TRIAL; CANCER; CHEMOTHERAPY; ERLOTINIB; EGFR; RADIOTHERAPY	Purpose: Lung cancer remains the most common cause of both cancer mortality and brain metastases (BM). The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of gene alterations and tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) on median survival (MS) and cause of death (CoD) in patients with BM from lung adenocarcinoma (L-adeno). Methods: A multi-institutional retrospective database of patients with L-adeno and newly diagnosed BM between 2006 and 2014 was created. Demographics, gene alterations, treatment, MS, and CoD were analyzed. The treatment patterns and outcomes were compared with those in prior trials. Results: Of 1521 L-adeno patients, 816 (54%) had known alteration status. The gene alteration rates were 29%, 10%, and 26% for EGFR, ALK, and KRAS, respectively. The time from primary diagnosis to BM for EGFR-/+ was 10/15 months (P = .02) and for ALK-/+ was 10/20 months (P<.01), respectively. The MS for the group overall (n=1521) was 15 months. The MS from first treatment for BM for EGFR and ALK-, EGFR+, ALK+ were 14, 23 (P<.01), and 45 (P<.0001) months, respectively. The MS after BM for EGFR+ patients who did/did not receive TKI before BM was 17/30 months (P<.01), respectively, but the risk of death was not statistically different between TKI-naive patients who did/did not receive TKI after the diagnosis of BM (EGFR/ALK hazard ratios: 1.06 [P = .84]/1.60 [P = .45], respectively). The CoD was nonneurologic in 82% of patients with known CoD. Conclusion: EGFR and ALK gene alterations are associated with delayed onset of BM and longer MS relative to patients without these alterations. The CoD was overwhelmingly nonneurologic in patients with known CoD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although surgical resection of the aganglionic segment allows HSCR children to survive this condition, a number of patients still suffer from impaired motility despite having myenteric ganglia in their postoperative distal bowel. Such phenomenon is also observed in patients suffering from other enteric neuropathies and, in both cases, colonic dysmotility is believed to result from abnormalities of myenteric ganglia and/or associated interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). To better understand this, we used a recently described HSCR mouse model called TashT. MethodsIntestinal motility parameters were assessed and correlated with extent of aganglionosis and with neuronal density in ganglionated regions. The neural composition of the myenteric plexus and the status of ICC networks was also evaluated using immunofluorescence. Key ResultsTashT(Tg/Tg) mice display a strong male bias in the severity of both colonic aganglionosis and hypoganglionosis, which are associated with male-specific reduced colonic motility. TashT(Tg/Tg) male mice also exhibit a specific increase in nNos(+) neurons that is restricted to the most distal ganglionated regions. In contrast, Calretinin(+) myenteric neurons, Sox10(+) myenteric glial cells, and cKit(+) ICC are not affected in TashT(Tg/Tg) mice. Conclusions and InferencesMale-specific impairment of colonic motility in TashT(Tg/Tg) mice is associated with both severe hypoganglionosis and myenteric neuronal imbalance. Considering these parameters in the clinic might be important for the management of postoperative HSCR patients.

Retrospective cohort study of the prospective collected American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Objective. The aim of the study was to identify predictive factors for the need of discharging patients to a facility other than home after lumbar spine fusion surgery. Summary of Background Data. Lumbar spine fusion surgery is a common surgical procedure used to treat a variety of lumbar spine conditions. A great number of patients fail to go home after surgery and require admission to a rehabilitation center. Predictive factors for discharging patients to a facility other than home after lumbar fusion surgery do not exist in the literature. Methods. A total of 15,092 patients undergoing lumbar spine fusion were dichotomized based on discharge destination to patients who were discharged home (N = 12,339) and others who were discharged to a facility other than home (N = 2753). Outcomes included patient demographics, comorbidities, and clinical characteristics. A multivariate logistic regression was used to identify whether outcomes studied were predictive factors for discharging patients to a facility other than home after lumbar fusion surgery. Results. Majority of patients were discharged home after lumbar fusion surgery (81.76%), with only some discharged to a facility other than home (18.24%). Multivariate analysis identified age, female sex, comorbidities (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and obesity), minor and major complications, hospital length of stay, operative time at least 259 minutes, and multilevel surgery as significant predictive factors of discharging patients to a facility other than home after lumbar fusion surgery. Conclusion. The identified predictive factors can help the health system in developing an algorithm for early recognition of patients requiring postoperative admission to a facility other than home and possibly decreasing their hospital length of stay. This can significantly decrease the hospital costs for such patients.

This aberrant immune response may intrinsically predispose IBD patients to infectious complications. Moreover, immunosuppressive medications used to treat IBD including corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, calcineurin inhibitors, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents and other biologics, further increase patients' susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, is an opportunistic viral reactivation often observed in IBD patients with several case reports demonstrating complicated or disseminated disease in those on immunosuppression. While HZ vaccination is recommended in all immunocompetent adults aged 60 years, as a live virus vaccine, it is currently contraindicated in IBD patients on anti-TNF therapy and in other significantly immunocompromised patient groups. While caution is still warranted in these circumstances, recent clinical data has emerged which has prompted us to review and examine the universal approach to HZ vaccination in the immunosuppressed IBD population. In the following narrative review, we will discuss and provide an overview of the clinical manifestations, incidence, management and prevention of HZ in the IBD patient.

This paper established a human salivary 3D organotypic slice culture model that could maintain its physiological functions as well as allowing a direct visualization of the cells. MethodsHuman salivary biopsies from six patients were embedded in agarose and submerged in cold buffer for thin (50m) sectioning using a vibratome. Salivary slices' were mechanically supported by a porous membrane insert that allowed an air-liquid interface and cultured in serum-free culture media. Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, physiological functions, and gene expression were assessed during 14days of culture. ResultsHuman salivary slices maintained cell survival (70-40%) and proliferation (6-17%) for 14days exvivo. The protein secretory (amylase) function decreased, but fluid (intracellular calcium mobilization) function was maintained. Acinar, ductal, and myoepithelial cell populations survived and maintained their 3D organization within the slice culture model. ConclusionThe human salivary slice culture model kept cells alive exvivo for 14days as well as maintaining their 3D morphology and physiological functions.

Transversus abdominal plane block for postoperative analgesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Review							LAPAROSCOPIC COLORECTAL SURGERY; CESAREAN DELIVERY; TAP BLOCK; INTRATHECAL MORPHINE; EPIDURAL ANALGESIA; WOUND-INFILTRATION; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BARIATRIC SURGERY; PAIN OUTCOMES; EFFICACY	The transversus abdominal plane (TAP) block has been described as an effective pain control technique after abdominal surgery. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) to account for the increasing number of TAP block studies appearing in the literature. The primary outcome we examined was the effect of TAP block on the postoperative pain score at six, 12, and 24 hr. The secondary outcome was 24-hr morphine consumption. We searched the United States National Library of Medicine database, the Excerpta Medica database, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Studies and identified RCTs focusing on the analgesic efficacy of TAP block compared with a control group [i.e., placebo, epidural analgesia, intrathecal morphine (ITM), and ilioinguinal nerve block after abdominal surgery]. Meta-analyses were performed on postoperative pain scores at rest at six, 12, and 24 hr (visual analogue scale, 0-10) and on 24-hr opioid consumption. In the 51 trials identified, compared with placebo, TAP block reduced the VAS for pain at six hours by 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.9 to -0.8; P < 0.001), at 12 hr by 2.0 (95% CI, -2.7 to -1.4; P < 0.001), and at 24 hr by 1.2 (95% CI, -1.6 to -0.8; P < 0.001). Similarly, compared with placebo, TAP block reduced morphine consumption at 24 hr after surgery (mean difference, -14.7 mg; 95% CI, -18.4 to -11.0; P < 0.001). We observed this reduction in pain scores and morphine consumption in the TAP block group after gynecological surgery, appendectomy, inguinal surgery, bariatric surgery, and urological surgery. Nevertheless, separate analysis of the studies comparing ITM with TAP block revealed that ITM seemed to have a greater analgesic efficacy. The TAP block can play an important role in the management of pain after abdominal surgery by reducing both pain scores and 24-hr morphine consumption. It may have particular utility when neuraxial techniques or opioids are contraindicated.

Because of the competition for shared neuronal resources, introducing a declarative memory task can impair learning of a new motor sequence and interference may occur during the procedural consolidation process. Here, we investigated the extent to which interference effects between memory systems are seen at the retrieval phase of skill learning. Healthy participants were assigned to a control (n = 15) or a declarative condition (n = 15) and trained on a sequence of finger movements (FOS task). Both groups showed similar improvement at the end of the practice session on the first day. Twenty-four hours later, controls were tested solely on the FOS task, while subjects in the declarative condition first engaged in a visuospatial task. Additional offline gains in performance were observed only in the control condition. The introduction of a visuospatial memory task just before retrieval of the motor skill was sufficient to eliminate these gains. This suggests that interference between procedural and declarative memory systems may also occur during subsequent motor recall. It is proposed that the interference effects are linked, in part, to the spatial nature of the motor and declarative tasks, which specifically depends upon hippocampal involvement.

Opposing effects of perceptual versus working memory load on emotional distraction	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Emotional attention; Distraction; Cognitive load; Perception; Working memory	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FEARFUL FACES; MODULATION; PICTURES; BRAIN; FMRI; VULNERABILITY; DEPRESSION	Throughout our day-to-day activities, we are subjected to numerous stimuli that compete for our attention; consequently, we must prioritize stimuli for further processing and influence over behaviour. Previous research has demonstrated that the extent to which task-irrelevant distractors are processed is mediated by the nature of the cognitive task, and the level of processing load. Importantly though, the interaction between cognitive task, processing load, and emotional distractor processing remains unclear. This is a particularly important question given the unique ways that emotion interacts with attention, and the fact that some other forms of processing load have been shown to reduce emotional distractor encoding. In the present study, participants were presented with emotional distractors during a perceptual and working memory task, under varying levels of load. In Experiment 1, we showed that the impact of emotional distractors on behaviour was reduced under conditions of high relative to low perceptual load. However, in sharp contrast, high working memory load was associated with increased emotional distraction. Importantly, these results were replicated in Experiment 2. Overall, the impact of processing load on emotional distraction varies according to the cognitive function being performed. These results raise the intriguing possibility that working memory operations deplete some of the cognitive resources needed to control the impact of emotion on behaviour. The findings, therefore, may have important implications for clinical populations featuring cognitive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation.	[Tavares, Tamara P.; Mitchell, Derek G.

Recent reports state that the 21st century is estimated to be the end of effective life for most water distribution networks in the United States. It is essential to implement accurate and cost-effective models that can predict deterioration rates along with estimates of remaining useful life (RUL) of the pipelines, to perform necessary intervention plans that can prevent disastrous failures. This study presents a computational model that predicts the RUL of water pipelines using an artificial neural network (ANN) model that has been developed using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. The model is implemented, tested, and trained using data collected from the city of Montreal. Results show that pipeline age, condition, length, diameter, material, and breakage rate are the most important factors in the prediction of RUL. Because the model shows robustness and accuracy in estimating the RUL of water pipelines in the case study, it can be used to support the municipality of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in future planning.

Among potential dispositional risk factors for SC, neuroticism has been related to various aspects of couple functioning, including psychological and physical partner abuse. Based on theoretical and empirical evidence, we suggest the existence of two maladaptive profiles on the neuroticism dimension and examine the curvilinear association between neuroticism and men's SC. A total of 299 adult couples completed measures of neuroticism and SC perpetrated by the male partner. Descriptive analyses indicated that SC translated mainly into insistence or partner pressure to engage the other in unwanted sexual activities. Results confirmed the hypothesis that both lower and higher levels of men's neuroticism predict higher levels of men's perpetrated SC, while low to moderate levels of neuroticism predict lower levels of men's SC. These findings contribute to the empirical literature on SC in community samples of couples and bear significant clinical implications for the evaluation and treatment of couples experiencing these negative sexual experiences.

Aim: To examine brain regions modulated by changes in subjective sexual arousal (SSA) rating intensity in men and women. Methods: Two groups (20 men, 20 women) viewed movie clips (erotic or humorous) while continuously evaluating changes in their SSA using a Likert-like scale (0 = not aroused, 10 = most aroused) and answering discrete questions about liking the movies and wanting sexual stimulation. Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Main Outcome Measures: Blood oxygen level-dependent responses and continuous and discrete measurements of sexual arousal. Results: Erotic movies induced significant SSA in men and women. No sex difference in mean SSA was found in response to the erotic movies on continuous or discrete measurements. Several brain regions were correlated with changes in SSA. Parametric modulation with rating intensity showed a specific group of regions within the parietal lobe that showed significant differences in activity among low, medium, and high SSA. Conclusion: Multiple regions were concordant with changes in SSA; however, a subset of regions in men and women was modulated by SSA intensity, a subset previously linked to attentional processes, monitoring of internal body representation, and processing of sensory information from the genitals. This study highlights that similar brain regions are activated during subjective assessment of sexual arousal in men and women. The data further highlight the fact that SSA is a complex phenomenon made up of multiple interoceptive and attentional processes. Copyright (C) 2016, International Society for Sexual Medicine.

NF-kappa B and IRF1 Induce Endogenous Retrovirus K Expression via Interferon-Stimulated Response Elements in Its 5 ' Long Terminal Repeat	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; REGULATORY FACTOR-I; REVERSE-TRANSCRIPTASE; SPINAL-CORD; ACTIVATION; DISEASE; LIGHT; ALS; TNF	Thousands of endogenous retroviruses (ERV), viral fossils of ancient germ line infections, reside within the human genome. Evidence of ERV activity has been observed widely in both health and disease. While this is most often cited as a bystander effect of cell culture or disease states, it is unclear which signals control ERV transcription. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that the viral promoter of endogenous retrovirus K (ERVK) is responsive to inflammatory transcription factors. Here we show that one reason for ERVK upregulation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the presence of functional interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the viral promoter. Transcription factor overexpression assays revealed independent and synergistic upregulation of ERVK by interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and NF-kappa B isoforms. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and LIGHT cytokine treatments of human astrocytes and neurons enhanced ERVK transcription and protein levels through IRF1 and NF-kappa B binding to the ISREs. We further show that in ALS brain tissue, neuronal ERVK reactivation is associated with the nuclear translocation of IRF1 and NF-kappa B isoforms p50 and p65. ERVK overexpression can cause motor neuron pathology in murine models. Our results implicate neuroinflammation as a key trigger of ERVK provirus reactivation in ALS. These molecular mechanisms may also extend to the pathobiology of other ERVK-associated inflammatory diseases, such as cancers, HIV infection, rheumatoid arthritis, and schizophrenia. IMPORTANCE It has been well established that inflammatory signaling pathways in ALS converge at NF-kappa B to promote neuronal damage. Our findings suggest that inflammation-driven IRF1 and NF-kappa B activity promotes ERVK reactivation in neurons of the motor cortex in ALS. Thus, quenching ERVK activity through antiretroviral or immunomodulatory regimens may hinder virus-mediated neuropathology and improve the symptoms of ALS or other ERVK-associated diseases.

Amiselimod is an oral selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 (S1P(1)) receptor, which is being developed for the treatment of various autoimmune-mediated diseases. We assessed the safety and efficacy of amiselimod in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Methods In this double-blind phase 2 trial, patients aged 18-60 years with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis from 84 centres in Europe and Canada were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) with an interactive web-response system to receive once daily oral amiselimod 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.4 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks. All study personnel, site personnel, investigators, and patients were masked to the treatment assignment during the study. The primary endpoint was the total number of gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted lesions on monthly brain MRI scans from weeks 8 to 24. Analysis was done on the predefined evaluable population (all randomised patients who did not have any major protocol deviations, completed 24 weeks of treatment as planned, and had at least three valid post-dose MRI scans). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01742052. Findings Between Jan 31,2013, and Dec 24,2013,536 patients were screened and 415 patients randomly assigned to amiselimod 0.1 mg (n=105), 0.2 mg (n=103), 0.4 mg (n=104), or placebo (n=103). The median total number of gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted lesions from weeks 8 to 24 did not differ between the amiselimod 0.1 mg and placebo groups (median 1.6 lesions [range 0-132] in the placebo group vs 2.0 [0-105] in the 0.1 mg group [median difference 0.0, 95% CI -1.0 to 0.0, p=0.7517]), but was significantly lower in the two higher amiselimod dose groups than in the placebo group (0.0 lesions [range 0-35] in the 0.2 mg group [median difference vs placebo -1.0, 95% CI -1.0 to 0.0, p=0.0021] and 0.0 [range 0-30] in the 0.4 mg group [-1.0, -1.2 to 0.0, p=0.0003]). The estimated incident rate ratio compared with placebo was dose-dependently decreased with amiselimod (0.1 mg 0.53 [95% CI 0.33-0. 85; p=0.0079], 0.2 mg 0.39 [95% CI 0.24-0.63; p=0.0001], and 0.4 mg 0.23 [95% CI 0.14-0.38; p<0.0001]). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, including infections and cardiac disorders, were similar in the amiselimod treatment groups (59 [56%] of 105 patients in the 0.1 mg group, 69 [67%] of 103 in the 0.2 mg group, and 58 [56%] of 104 in the 0.4 mg group) to the incidence in the placebo group (66 [64%] of 103 patients); the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were headache (ten [10%], ten [10%], and ten [10%] vs four [4%]) and nasopharyngitis (nine [9%], seven [7%], ten [10%] vs eight [8%]). No serious treatment emergent adverse event was reported for more than one patient in any group and no clinically significant heart rate reduction was observed at any amiselimod dose. Interpretation Amiselimod 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg significantly reduced the total number of gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted lesions. The safety and efficacy profiles of amiselimod suggest that this S1P, receptor modulator is a new potential treatment in multiple sclerosis and potentially other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and deserves further investigation.

Intracellular disulfide reduction by phosphine-borane complexes: Mechanism of action for neuroprotection	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Phosphine-borane complexes; Disulfide reduction; Neuroprotection	RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; AXONAL INJURY; IN-VIVO; MEMBRANE-PERMEABILITY; NEURONAL APOPTOSIS; SUPEROXIDE ANION; DRUG DISCOVERY; DEATH; GLAUCOMA; MODEL	Phosphine-borane complexes are novel cell-permeable drugs that protect neurons from axonal injury in vitro and in vivo. These drugs activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) cell survival pathway and are therefore neuroprotective, but do not scavenge superoxide. In order to understand the interaction between superoxide signaling of neuronal death and the action of phosphineborane complexes, their biochemical activity in cell-free and in vitro assays was studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry and using an intracellular dithiol reporter that becomes fluorescent when its disulfide bond is cleaved. These studies demonstrated that bis(3-propionic acid methyl ester) phenylphosphine-borane complex (PB1) and (3-propionic acid methyl ester) diphenylphosphine-borane complex (PB2) are potent intracellular disulfide reducing agents which are cell permeable. EPR and pharmacological studies demonstrated reducing activity but not scavenging of superoxide. Given that phosphine-borane complexes reduce cell injury from mitochondrial superoxide generation but do not scavenge superoxide, this implies a mechanism where an intracellular superoxide burst induces downstream formation of protein disulfides. The redox-dependent cleavage of the disulfides is therefore a novel mechanism of neuroprotection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Propofol is the most used general anesthetic in clinical practice whose mechanisms of neurotoxicity on the developing brain remains to be examined in depth. This study investigated effects of different exposures to propofol anesthesia on Fas receptor and Fas ligand expressions, which mediate proapoptotic and proinflammation signaling in the brain. Propofol (20 mg/kg) was administered to 7-day-old rats in multiple doses sufficient to maintain 2-, 4- and 6-h duration of anesthesia. Animals were sacrificed at 0, 4, 16 and 24 h after termination of anesthesia. It was found that propofol anesthesia induced Fas/FasL and downstream caspase-8 expression more prominently in the thalamus than in the cortex. Opposite, Bcl-2 and caspase-9, markers of intrinsic pathway activation, were shown to be more influenced by propofol treatment in the cortex. Further, we have established upregulation of caspase-1 and IL-1 beta cytokine transcription as well as subsequent activation of microglia that is potentially associated with brain inflammation. Behavioral analyses revealed that P35 and P60 animals, neonatally exposed to propofol, had significantly higher motor activity during three consecutive days of testing in the open field, though formation of the intersession habituation was not prevented. This data, together with our previous results, contributes to elucidation of complex mechanisms of propofol toxicity in developing brain.

Study Design Prospective experimental. Setting Experimental animal study. Subjects and Method Mometasone furoate (MF)-eluting miniature sticks were implanted through a myringotomy incision into the middle ear of 10 guinea pigs. Two additional ears of 2 animals served as controls. Fourteen days after implantation, perilymphatic fluid was collected through an endaural cochleostomy. MF concentrations were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography, and the middle ear mucosal inflammation was graded with hematoxylin and eosin colorations. Results Fourteen days after implantation, all tympanic membranes had fully healed. An average of 165 ng/mL of MF was detected in the perilymphatic fluid of the experimental ears, and none was measured in control ears. Microscopic residues of the ministicks were found in 90% of the samples, confirming the bioabsorbable properties of this device. Histologic analysis of the middle ear mucosa found similar inflammation profiles in both groups, thereby suggesting middle ear tolerability. Conclusion MF-coated bioabsorbable miniature stick allows for prolonged delivery over 14 days without injuring the middle ear mucosa. Middle ear-sustained steroid delivery may prove to be beneficial in numerous neurotologic conditions.

First, we formulate a constrained dynamic model of compliant/flexible joints for quadruped robots and a reduced-order dynamic model is developed considering the robot interaction with the environment through multiple contacts. A dynamic force distribution approach based on quadratic objective function is proposed for evaluating the optimal contact forces to cope with the external wrench, and fuzzy-based adaptive control of compliant/flexible joints for quadruped robots is proposed to suppress uncertainties in the dynamics of the robot and actuators. The dynamic surface control approaches and fuzzy learning algorithms are combined in the proposed framework. All the signals of the closed-loop system have proven to be uniformly ultimately bounded through Lyapunov synthesis. Simulation experiments were performed for a quadruped robot with compliant/flexible joints. The benefits of its tracking accuracy and robustness indicate that the proposed framework is promising for the robots with payload uncertainties and external disturbances.

One aspect of bimanual coordination is inter-limb coupling. This is characterized by the harmonization of movement parameters between limbs. We assessed different aspects of bimanual coordination in patients with PD, including inter-limb coupling, and determined whether they are altered by subthalamic (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) or dopaminergic medication. Twenty PD patients were tested before STN DBS surgery; with and without medication. Post-surgery, patients were tested with their stimulators on and off as well as with and without medication. Patients were asked to perform a unimanual and bimanual rapid repetitive diadochokinesis task. The difference in mean amplitude and mean duration of cycles between hands was computed in order to assess inter-limb coupling. Also, mean angular velocity of both hands and structural coupling were computed for the bimanual task. There was a positive effect of medication and stimulation on mean angular velocity, which relates to clinical improvement. PD patients exhibited temporal interlimb coupling that was not altered by either medication or STN stimulation. However, PD patients did not exhibit spatial inter-limb coupling. Again, this was not altered by medication or stimulation. Collectively, the results suggest that structures independent of the dopaminergic system and basal ganglia may mediate temporal and spatial inter-limb coupling. (C) 2016 IBRO.

They are signaling through three distinct types of receptors: tropomyosin receptor kinase family (TrkA/B/C), p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and sortilin. Aberrant expression of p75(NTR) in the CNS is implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this work was to evaluate one of the very few reported p75(NTR) small molecule ligands as a lead compound for development of novel PET radiotracers for in vivo p75(NTR) imaging. Here we report that previously described ligand LM11A-24 shows significant inhibition of carbachol-induced persistent firing (PF) of entorhinal cortex (EC) pyramidal neurons in wild-type mice via selective interaction with p75(NTR). Based on this electrophysiological assay, the compound has very high potency with an EC50 <10 nM. We optimized the radiosynthesis of [C-11]LM11A-24 as the first attempt to develop PET radioligand for in vivo imaging of p75(NTR). Despite some weak interaction with CNS tissues, the radiolabeled compound showed unfavorable in vivo profile presumably due to high hydrophilicity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Access to cognitive assessment is often limited by issues of expense and by the lengthiness of the testing procedure. As a result, an interest emerged in the development of self-administered questionnaires to assess an individual's perception of their own cognitive functioning. These questionnaires could be more easily used for screening as part of a routine psychiatric consultation. However, few studies have compared the results of the novel subjective measures with established objective tests of cognitive skills, and most have focused on psychopathologies marked by major and apparent cognitive impairments. Objective: The main goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between objective and subjective cognition in patients with major depression (MDD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) both associated with subtle cognitive impairments on neuropsychological testing. Methods: First, we compared the performance of patients with MDD and ADHD to that of healthy controls (HC) on objective and subjective measures of cognition. Then, we evaluated the association between objective and subjective measures of cognitive functioning in the three groups of participants. Results: Patients with MDD and ADHD performed worse than HC on neuropsychological tests and reported more cognitive difficulties in their daily life. Only a moderate correlation was observed between objective and subjective measures of cognition in individuals with MDD and ADHD. Subjective cognitive measures were more closely correlated with functioning than objective measures. Conclusion: These fmdings suggest that neuropsychological testing and self-reported scales of cognition are not interchangeable but rather give information about different constructs. The evaluation of cognitive functioning should ideally include both objective and subjective measures of cognition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recycling combustion ash for sustainable cement production: A critical review with data-mining and time-series predictive models	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Review						Combustion ash; Cement production; Waste recycling; Artificial neural network; Time-series analysis	RICE-HUSK ASH; OIL FUEL ASH; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CRACKING CATALYST RESIDUE; BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; BIOMASS FLY-ASH; INCORPORATING SILICA FUME; SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; KINETIC-DIFFUSIVE MODEL; ACTIVATED PAPER SLUDGE	Combustion is a complex process that produces energy as the goal and ashes as by-products. The ash of coal, biomass. and solid waste combustion can be used as pozzolans in blended cement due to the similarity of their physiochemical properties to conventional pozzolans (e.g. silica fume). This strategy effectively recycles pozzolanic-active combustion ash and replaces a significant proportion of Portland cement, which potentially reduces the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cement production.. However, cement producers wishing to substitute pozzolanic-active ash for conventional pozzolans lack information on the pozzolanic activity (PA) of ash from diverse combustible materials. A data-mining model that can extract key information for predicting the PA of combustion ash is envisioned as a screening tool to assess the pozzolanic potential of candidate combustible materials prior to experimental work. Hence, the objectives of this chapter are, 1) to critically review the recent research progress in using various combustion ashes as pozzolans, including the mechanism of the pozzolanic reaction, sources of eligible materials, and methods of PA improvement, 2) to create a data-mining artificial neural network (ANN) model for PA prediction built upon data reported in the scientific literature from 1998 to 2015, and 3) to describe the effect of cement curing period on PA, based on a time series model. The ANN and time-series models developed in this study can accurately forecast the PA of combustion ashes during 3-90 d curing (R-2 = 0.8479-0.9914). We recommend these screening tools as rapid indicators of the pozzolanic potential of combustion ash prior to undertaking strength tests and other experimental testing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The brain basis of MC is incompletely understood, and it is debated whether MC on different processes is subserved by common or divergent networks. We combined behavioral phenotyping with multi-modal neuroimaging to investigate whether structural substrates of individual differences in MC on higher-order cognition (MC-C) are dissociable from those underlying MC on perceptual accuracy (MC-P). Motivated by conceptual work suggesting a link between MC and cognitive perspective taking, we furthermore tested for overlaps between MC substrates and mentalizing networks. In a large sample of healthy adults, individual differences in MC-C and MC-P did not correlate. MRI-based cortical thickness mapping revealed a structural basis of this independence, by showing that individual differences in MC-P related to right prefrontal cortical thickness, while MC-C scores correlated with measures in lateral prefrontal, temporo-parietal, and posterior midline regions. Surface-based superficial white matter diffusivity analysis revealed substrates resembling those seen for cortical thickness, confirming the divergence of both MC faculties using an independent imaging marker. Despite their specificity, substrates of MC-C and MC-P fell clearly within networks known to participate in mentalizing, confirmed by task-based fMRI in the same subjects, previous meta-analytical findings, and ad-hoc Neurosynth-based meta-analyses. Our integrative multi-method approach indicates domain-specific substrates of MC; despite their divergence, these nevertheless likely rely on component processes mediated by circuits also involved in mentalizing.

JC virus encodes a protein, termed T-antigen (T-ag), which is essential for its replication and pathogenicity. Previous studies of JCV T-ag have, in general, used antibodies raised against SV40 T-ag. Unfortunately, SV40 T-ag is also detected in humans and therefore there have been concerns about cross-reactivity. To address this issue, we have isolated a monoclonal antibody that binds to the JCV, but not the SV40, T-ag origin-binding domain (OBD). Furthermore, the region on the surface of the JCV T-ag OBD that is recognized by the "anti-JCV OBD mAb" has been mapped. We also demonstrate that the "anti-JCV OBD mAb" will be a useful reagent for standard techniques (e.g., Westerns blots and ELISAs). Finally, we note that additional monoclonal Abs that are specific for the T-ags encoded by the other human polyomaviruses could be generated by adopting the approach described herein.

As pain is driven by sensory transmission and opioid receptors couple to inhibitory G proteins, according to the classical concept, opioids alleviate pain by activating receptors on neurons and blocking the release of excitatory mediators (e.g., substance P). Here we show that analgesia can be mediated by opioid receptors in immune cells. We propose that activation of leukocyte opioid receptors leads to the secretion of opioid peptides Met-enkephalin, beta-endorphin and dynorphin A (1-17), which subsequently act at local neuronal receptors, to relieve pain. In a mouse model of neuropathic pain induced by a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, exogenous agonists of delta-, mu- and x-opioid receptors injected at the damaged nerve infiltrated by opioid peptide- and receptor expressing leukocytes, produced analgesia, as assessed with von Frey filaments. The analgesia was attenuated by pharmacological or genetic inactivation of opioid peptides, and by leukocyte depletion. This decrease in analgesia was restored by the transfer of wild-type, but not opioid receptor-lacking leukocytes. Ex vivo, exogenous opioids triggered secretion of opioid peptides from wild-type immune cells isolated from damaged nerves, which was diminished by blockade of G alpha i/o or G beta gamma (but not Gas) proteins, by chelator of intracellular (but not extracellular) Ca2+, by blockers of phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors, and was partially attenuated by protein kinase C inhibitor. Similarly, the leukocyte depletion-induced decrease in exogenous opioid analgesia was re-established by transfer of immune cells ex vivo pretreated with extracellular Ca2+ chelator, but was unaltered by leukocytes pretreated with intracellular Ca2+ chelator or blockers of Gai/o and Gpy proteins. Thus, both ex vivo opioid peptide release and in vivo analgesia were mediated by leukocyte opioid receptors coupled to the G alpha i/o-G beta gamma protein-PLC-IP3 receptors-intracellular Ca2+ pathway. Our findings suggest that opioid receptors in immune cells are important targets for the control of pathological pain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Various statistical methods were used to analyze the fluoride data with particular consideration for changes across three stages of pregnancy and against sociodemographic variables. Results: All samples had detectable levels of fluoride. The mean urinary and plasma fluoride levels were 0.91 and 0.0221 mg/L respectively, and these were not statistically different across three stages of pregnancy. Fluoride levels correlated across the stages of pregnancy studied, with stronger correlations between neighboring stages. Urinary fluoride changed as pregnancy progressed with levels increasing until similar to 23 weeks and then decreasing until the end of pregnancy. For plasma fluoride, there was a decreasing trend but this was not of statistical significance. Creatinine-adjusted urinary fluoride levels did not associate consistently with any of the sociodemographic variables studied. Conclusions: This study provides the most extensive characterization to date of fluoride exposure throughout pregnancy. These results provide the foundation to explore exposure-related health outcomes in the ELEMENT cohort and other studies. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

An ecological test of its negative influence on brain development can be made by examining the prospective association between early childhood household smoke exposure and later classroom behavior. Using a longitudinal birth cohort, we examined the unique contribution of household tobacco smoke exposure to children's subsequent classroom engagement at age 10. From child ages 1.5 to 7 years, parents of 2,055 participants from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development reported on household smoking by themselves and other home occupants. At age 10, fourth-grade teachers reported on the child's classroom engagement. In terms of prevalence, 58% of parents reported that their children were never exposed to smoke in the home, while 34% and 8% of children were exposed to transient and continuous household smoke, respectively. Compared with never exposed children, those who were exposed to transient and continuous household smoke scored 13% and 9% of a standard deviation lower on classroom engagement in fourth grade, standardized B = -.128 (95% confidence interval = -.186, -.069) and standardized B = -.093 (95% confidence interval = -.144, -.043), respectively. Compared with their never exposed peers, children exposed to transient and continuous early childhood household smoke showed proportionately less classroom engagement, which reflects task-orientation, following directions, and working well autonomously and with others. This predisposition poses risks for high school dropout, which from a population health perspective is closely linked with at-risk lifestyle habits and unhealthy outcomes.

From an ethical and clinical standpoint, neurological prognosis is fundamental in the care of neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. This qualitative study explores physician perspectives about neurological prognosis in neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. This study aimed, through semistructured interviews with neonatologists and pediatric neurologists, to understand the practice of prognostication. Qualitative thematic content analysis was used for data analysis. The authors report 2 main findings: (1) neurological prognosis remains fundamental to quality-of-life predictions and considerations of best interest, and (2) magnetic resonance imaging is presented to parents with a greater degree of certainty than actually exists. Further research is needed to explore both the parental perspective and, prospectively, the impact of different clinical approaches and styles to prognostication for neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

The present prospective study aimed to determine the contribution of parents' personality and offspring behaviour problems in middle childhood to offspring SRBs 10 years later. We hypothesized that offspring externalizing problems in childhood would mediate the relationship between parents' personality traits of neuroticism and agreeableness and adolescent SRBs. Furthermore, we expected these associations to be more robust among the OBD than controls. At baseline, 102 offspring (52 OBD and 50 controls) aged between 4 and 14 years were assessed along with their parents, who completed a self-report personality measure and child behavior rating. Behaviour ratings were also obtained from the children's teachers. Ten years later the offspring completed an interview assessing SRBs. Mediation analyses using bootstrapping revealed that, after controlling for age and presence of an affective disorder, externalizing behaviors served as a pathway through which high parental neuroticism, low parental agreeableness, and low parental extraversion were related to SRBs in offspring. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that the relationship between parental neuroticism and childhood externalizing problems was stronger for OBD than controls. These findings add to our previous results showing parents' personality contributes to intergenerational risk transfer through behavioral problems in middle childhood. These results carry implications for optimal timing of preventative interventions in the OBD.

Changes in the modulation of brain activity during context encoding vs. context retrieval across the adult lifespan	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Lifespan; Aging; Episodic memory; Encoding; Retrieval; fMRI	AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; SOURCE MEMORY RETRIEVAL; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; EPISODIC MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; OLDER-ADULTS; PARIETAL CORTEX; ELDERLY ADULTS; ITEM MEMORY	Age-related deficits in context memory may arise from neural changes underlying both encoding and retrieval of context information. Although age-related functional changes in the brain regions supporting context memory begin at midlife, little is known about the functional changes with age that support context memory encoding and retrieval across the adult lifespan. We investigated how age-related functional changes support context memory across the adult lifespan by assessing linear changes with age during successful context encoding and retrieval. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we compared young, middle-aged and older adults during both encoding and retrieval of spatial and temporal details of faces. Multivariate behavioral partial least squares (B-PLS) analysis of fMRI data identified a pattern of whole-brain activity that correlated with a linear age term and a pattern of whole-brain activity that was associated with an age-by-memory phase (encoding vs. retrieval) interaction. Further investigation of this latter effect identified three main findings: 1) reduced phase-related modulation in bilateral fusiform gyrus, left superior/anterior frontal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus that started at midlife and continued to older age, 2) reduced phase-related modulation in bilateral inferior parietal lobule that occurred only in older age, and 3) changes in phase-related modulation in older but not younger adults in left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus that was indicative of age-related over-recruitment. We conclude that age-related reductions in context memory arise in midlife and are related to changes in perceptual recollection and changes in fronto-parietal retrieval monitoring.

Morphological Alterations in the Thalamus, Striatum, and Pallidum in Autism Spectrum Disorder	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; BASAL GANGLIA; ASPERGERS-SYNDROME; BRAIN VOLUME; CORTEX; CONNECTIVITY; CHILDREN; MRI; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ABNORMALITIES	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with cognitive, motor, and emotional symptoms. The thalamus and basal ganglia form circuits with the cortex supporting all three of these behavioral domains. Abnormalities in the structure of subcortical regions may suggest atypical development of these networks, with implications for understanding the neural basis of ASD symptoms. Findings from previous volumetric studies have been inconsistent. Here, using advanced surface-based methodology, we investigated localized differences in shape and surface area in the basal ganglia and thalamus in ASD, using T1-weighted anatomical images from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (373 male participants aged 7-35 years with ASD and 384 typically developing). We modeled effects of diagnosis, age, and their interaction on volume, shape, and surface area. In participants with ASD, we found expanded surface area in the right posterior thalamus corresponding to the pulvinar nucleus, and a more concave shape in the left mediodorsal nucleus. The shape of both caudal putamen and pallidum showed a relatively steeper increase in concavity with age in ASD. Within ASD participants, restricted, repetitive behaviors were positively associated with surface area in bilateral globus pallidus. We found no differences in overall volume, suggesting that surface-based approaches have greater sensitivity to detect localized differences in subcortical structure. This work adds to a growing body of literature implicating corticobasal ganglia-thalamic circuits in the pathophysiology of ASD. These circuits subserve a range of cognitive, emotional, and motor functions, and may have a broad role in the complex symptom profile in ASD.	[Schuetze, Manuela; Cho, Ivy Y.

The premotor cortex, specifically the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), seems to play a key role in auditory-motor integration, and in mapping the association between a sound and the movement used to produce it. In the present studies we tested the causal role of the dPMC in learning and applying auditory-motor associations using 1 Hz repetitive Transcranical Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). In this paradigm, non-musicians learn a set of auditory-motor associations through melody training in two contexts: first when the sound to key-press mapping was in a conventional sequential order (low to high tones mapped onto keys from left to right), and then when it was in a novel scrambled order. Participant's ability to match the four pitches to four computer keys was tested before and after the training. In both experiments, the group that received 1 Hz rTMS over the dPMC showed no significant improvement on the pitch-matching task following training, whereas the control group (who received rTMS to visual cortex) did. Moreover, in Experiment 2 where the pitch-key mapping was novel, rTMS over the dPMC also interfered with learning. These findings suggest that rTMS over dPMC disturbs the formation of auditory-motor associations, especially when the association is novel and must be learned rather explicitly. The present results contribute to a better understanding of the role of dPMC in auditory-motor integration, suggesting a critical role of dPMC in learning the link between an action and its associated sound.

Clock-driven vasopressin neurotransmission mediates anticipatory thirst prior to sleep	NATURE			English	Article							VASCULOSUM LAMINAE TERMINALIS; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; BODY-TEMPERATURE; RAT-BRAIN; ORGANIZATION; DRINKING; WATER; STRESS	Circadian rhythms have evolved to anticipate and adapt animals to the constraints of the earth's 24-hour light cycle(1). Although the molecular processes that establish periodicity in clock neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are well understood, the mechanisms by which axonal projections from the central clock drive behavioural rhythms are unknown(2-4). Here we show that the sleep period in mice (Zeitgeber time, ZT0-12) is preceded by an increase in water intake promoted entirely by the central clock, and not motivated by physiological need. Mice denied this surge experienced significant dehydration near the end of the sleep period, indicating that this water intake contributes to the maintenance of overnight hydromineral balance. Furthermore, this effect relies specifically on the activity of SCN vasopressin (VP) neurons that project to thirst neurons in the OVLT (organum vasculosum lamina terminalis), where VP is released as a neurotransmitter. SCN VP neurons become electrically active during the anticipatory period (ZT21.5-23.5), and depolarize and excite OVLT neurons through the activation of postsynaptic VP V1a receptors and downstream non-selective cation channels. Optogenetic induction of VP release before the anticipatory period (basal period; ZT19.5-21.5) excited OVLT neurons and prompted a surge in water intake. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of VP release during the anticipatory period inhibited the firing of OVLT neurons and prevented the corresponding increase in water intake. Our findings reveal the existence of anticipatory thirst, and demonstrate this behaviour to be driven by excitatory peptidergic neurotransmission mediated by VP release from central clock neurons.

In an APP transgenic mouse model of AD-like amyloid pathology we found that early intraneuronal amyloid beta build-up is sufficient to unleash a global and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (bace-1) DNA demethylation in AD-vulnerable brain regions. S-adenosylmethionine administration at these early stages abolished this hypomethylation, diminished the amyloid pathology and restored cognitive capabilities. To assess a possible human significance of findings, we examined the methylation at 12 CpGs sites in the bace-1 promoter, using genome-wide DNA methylation data from 740 postmortem human brains. Thus, we found significant associations of bace-1 promoter methylation with beta-amyloid load among persons with AD dementia, and PHFtau tangle density. Our results support a plausible causal role for the earliest amyloid beta accumulation to provoke DNA hypomethylation, influencing AD pathological outcomes.

For example, activation of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in the DLS reduces intake in rats that consume moderate amounts of alcohol. Here, we tested whether long-term excessive consumption of alcohol produces neuroadaptations in BDNF signaling in the rat DLS. We found that BDNF was no longer able to gate alcohol self-administration after a history of repeated cycles of binge alcohol drinking and withdrawal. We then elucidated the possible neuroadaptations that could block the ability of BDNF to keep consumption of alcohol in moderation. We report that intermittent access to 20% alcohol in a two-bottle choice paradigm that models excessive alcohol drinking produces a mobilization of DLS p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), whose activities oppose those of the Trk receptors, including TrkB. These neuroadaptations were not observed in the DLS of rats exposed to continuous access to 10% alcohol or in rats consuming sucrose. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of the p75NTR gene in the DLS, as well as intra-DLS infusion or systemic administration of the p75NTR modulator, LM11A-31, significantly reduced binge drinking of alcohol. Together, our results suggest that excessive alcohol consumption produces a change in BDNF signaling in the DLS, which is mediated by the recruitment of p75NTR. Our data also imply that modulators of p75NTR signaling could be developed as medications for alcohol abuse disorders.

The influence of the pre-metastatic niche on breast cancer metastasis	CANCER LETTERS			English	Review						Breast cancer; Metastasis; Metastatic niche; Tumour/stromal interactions; Metabolic coupling	STEM-CELL NICHE; TUMOR PROGRESSION; LIVER METASTASIS; BONE METASTASIS; PREMETASTATIC NICHE; PROMOTE METASTASIS; ENERGY-METABOLISM; BRAIN METASTASIS; LYMPHOCYTE RATIO; TENASCIN-C	The emergence of metastatic disease constitutes a significant life-threatening development during cancer progression. To date, intensive efforts have been focused on understanding the intrinsic properties that confer malignant potential to cancer cells, as well as the role of the primary tumour microenvironment in promoting cancer metastasis. Beyond events occurring at the primary site, the metastatic cascade is composed of numerous barriers that must be overcome in order for disseminating cancer cells to form distal metastases. The most formidable of these is the ability of cancer cells to seed and grow in a completely foreign microenvironment. Interestingly, solid malignancies often display a particular tropism for specific tissue sites. For example, breast patients with metastatic disease will often develop bone, lung, liver or brain metastases. This mini-review will explore aspects of pre-existing and induced metastatic niches and focus on how the unique composition and function of diverse niche components, within common sites of breast cancer metastasis, enable the survival and growth of disseminated cancer cells. These common supportive functions of the niche are provided by a complex array of stromal components and molecular mechanisms that are, in part, reflective of the tissue in which the metastases arise. Finally, the metastatic niche is a dynamic structure that is continually altered and sculpted by the cancer cells during progression of the metastatic lesion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Little is known about their origin and evolution. Case presentation: This study presents the case of a patient in the acute phase of a severe TBI. The patient was injured at work when falling 12 m into a mine and was hospitalized in the regular wards of a level I trauma centre. From days 31 to 45 post-injury, once he had reached a level of medical stability and continuous analgosedation had been ceased, his sleep-wake cycle was monitored using actigraphy. Results showed significant sleep-wake disturbances and severe sleep deprivation. Indeed, the patient had an average nighttime sleep efficiency of 32.7 +/- 15.4 %, and only an average of 4.8 +/- 1.3 h of sleep per 24-h period. After hospital discharge to the rehabilitation centre, where he remained for 5 days, the patient was readmitted to the same neurological unit for paranoid delusions. During his second hospital stay, actigraphy recordings resumed from days 69 to 75 post-injury. A major improvement in his sleep-wake cycle was observed during this second stay, with an average nighttime sleep efficiency of 96.3 +/- 0.9 % and an average of 14.1 +/- 0.9 h of sleep per 24-h period. Conclusion: This study is the first to extensively document sleep-wake disturbances in both the acute and subacute phases of severe TBI. Results show that prolonged sleep deprivation can be observed after TBI, and suggest that the hospital environment only partially contributes to sleep-wake disturbances. Continuous actigraphic monitoring may prove to be a useful clinical tool in the monitoring of patients hospitalized after severe TBI in order to detect severe sleep deprivation requiring intervention. The direct impact of sleep-wake disturbances on physiological and cognitive recovery is not well understood within this population, but is worth investigating and improving.

However, the application of ICA in multi-group designs is not straightforward. We have recently developed a new method named "shared and specific independent component analysis" (SSICA) to perform between-group comparisons in the ICA framework. SSICA is sensitive to extract those components which represent a significant difference in functional connectivity between groups or conditions, i.e., components that could be considered "specific" for a group or condition. Here, we investigated the performance of SSICA on realistic simulations, and task fMRI data and compared the results with one of the state-of-the-art group ICA approaches to infer between-group differences. We examined SSICA robustness with respect to the number of allowable extracted specific components and between-group orthogonality assumptions. Furthermore, we proposed a modified formulation of the back-reconstruction method to generate group-level t-statistics maps based on SSICA results. We also evaluated the consistency and specificity of the extracted specific components by SSICA. The results on realistic simulated and real fMRI data showed that SSICA outperforms the regular group ICA approach in terms of reconstruction and classification performance. We demonstrated that SSICA is a powerful data-driven approach to detect patterns of differences in functional connectivity across groups/conditions, particularly in model-free designs such as resting-state fMRI. Our findings in task fMRI show that SSICA confirms results of the general linear model (GLM) analysis and when combined with clustering analysis, it complements GLM findings by providing additional information regarding the reliability and specificity of networks.

Necessary Contributions of Human Frontal Lobe Subregions to Reward Learning in a Dynamic, Multidimensional Environment	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						associative learning; attention; decision making; frontal lobe; neuropsychology; value	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; LATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VISUAL-SEARCH; RECOGNITION MEMORY; CREDIT ASSIGNMENT; MENTAL ROTATION; STIMULUS-VALUE	Real-world decisions are typically made between options that vary along multiple dimensions, requiring prioritization of the important dimensions to support optimal choice. Learning in this setting depends on attributing decision outcomes to the dimensions with predictive relevance rather than to dimensions that are irrelevant and nonpredictive. This attribution problem is computationally challenging, and likely requires an interplay between selective attention and reward learning. Both these processes have been separately linked to the prefrontal cortex, but little is known about how they combine to support learning the reward value of multidimensional stimuli. Here, we examined the necessary contributions of frontal lobe subregions in attributing feedback to relevant and irrelevant dimensions on a trial-by-trial basis in humans. Patients with focal frontal lobe damage completed a demanding reward learning task where options varied on three dimensions, only one of which predicted reward. Participants with left lateral frontal lobe damage attributed rewards to irrelevant dimensions, rather than the relevant dimension. Damage to the ventromedial frontal lobe also impaired learning about the relevant dimension, but did not increase reward attribution to irrelevant dimensions. The results argue for distinct roles for these two regions in learning the value of multidimensional decision options under dynamic conditions, with the lateral frontal lobe required for selecting the relevant dimension to associate with reward, and the ventromedial frontal lobe required to learn the reward association itself.

Optimized Parallel Coding of Second-Order Stimulus Features by Heterogeneous Neural Populations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adaptation; electrosensory; envelope; neural coding; SK channels; weakly electric fish	WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; POWER-LAW ADAPTATION; LATERAL LINE LOBE; ELECTROSENSORY NEURONS; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; TEMPORAL DECORRELATION; REDUNDANCY REDUCTION; DENDRITIC MORPHOLOGY	Efficient processing of sensory input is essential to ensure an organism's survival in its natural environment. Growing evidence suggests that sensory neurons can optimally encode natural stimuli by ensuring that their tuning opposes stimulus statistics, such that the resulting neuronal response contains equal power at all frequencies (i.e., is "white"). Such temporal decorrelation or whitening has been observed across modalities, but the effects of neural heterogeneities on determining tuning and thus responses to natural stimuli have not been investigated. Here, we investigate how heterogeneities in sensory pyramidal neurons organized in three parallel maps representing the body surface determine responses to second-order electrosensory stimulus features in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. While some sources of heterogeneities such as ON-and OFF-type responses to first-order did not affect responses to second-order electrosensory stimulus features, other sources of heterogeneity within and across the maps strongly determined responses. We found that these cells effectively performed a fractional differentiation operation on their input with exponents ranging from zero (no differentiation) to 0.4 (strong differentiation). Varying adaptation in a simple model explained these heterogeneities and predicted a strong correlation between fractional differentiation and adaptation. Using natural stimuli, we found that only a small fraction of neurons implemented temporal whitening. Rather, a large fraction of neurons did not perform any significant whitening and thus preserved natural input statistics in their responses. We propose that this information is needed to properly decode optimized information sent in parallel through temporally whitened responses based on context.

Oncogenic effects of urotensin-II in cells lacking tuberous sclerosis complex-2	ONCOTARGET			English	Article						TSC2; rnTOR; urotensin; lymphangioleiomyomotosis; angiomyoUpoma	AUTOCRINE/PARACRINE GROWTH-FACTOR; FOCAL ADHESION; RECEPTOR; LYMPHANGIOLEIOMYOMATOSIS; EXPRESSION; MTOR; PROLIFERATION; ACTIVATION; RAPAMYCIN; PROTEIN	Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a destructive lung disease that can arise sporadically or in adults suffering from the tumor syndrome tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Microscopic tumors ('LAM nodules') in the lung interstitium arise from lymphatic invasion and metastasis. These consist of smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) that exhibit markers of neural crest differentiation and loss of the tumor suppressor protein 'tuberous sclerosis complex-2' (TSC2). Consistent with a neural phenotype, expression of the neuropeptide urotensin-H and its receptor was detected in LAM nodules. We hypothesized that loss of TSC2 sensitizes cells to the oncogenic effects of urotensin-II. TSC2-deficient Eker rat uterine leiomyoma ELT3 cells were stably transfected with empty vector or plasmid for the expression of TSC2. Urotensin-I1 increased cell viability and proliferation in TSC2-deficient cells, but not in TSC2-reconstituted cells. When exposed to urotensin-II, TSC2-deficient cells exhibited greater migration, anchorage independent cell growth, and matrix invasion. The effects of urotensin-II on TSC2deficient cells were blocked by the urotensin receptor antagonist SB657510, and accompanied by activation of Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase and focal adhesion kinase. Urotensin-H-induced proliferation and migration were reproduced in TSC2deficient human angiomyolipoma cells, but not in those stably expressing TSC2. In a mouse xenograft model, SB657510 blocked the growth of established ELT3 tumors, reduced the number of circulating tumor cells, and attenuated the production of VEGF-D, a clinical biomarker of LAM. Urotensin receptor antagonists may be selective therapeutic agents for the treatment of LAM or other neural crest-derived neoplasms featuring loss of TSC2 or increased expression of the urotensin receptor.

Regional Reproducibility of BOLD Calibration Parameter M, OEF and Resting-State CMRO2 Measurements with QUO2 MRI	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; SPIN-LABELING MRI; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; OXYGEN EXTRACTION FRACTION; LEVEL-DEPENDENT RESPONSES; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; METABOLIC-RATE; NORMAL VALUES	The current generation of calibrated MRI methods goes beyond simple localization of task-related responses to allow the mapping of resting-state cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in micromolar units and estimation of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Prior to the adoption of such techniques in neuroscience research applications, knowledge about the precision and accuracy of absolute estimates of CMRO2 and OEF is crucial and remains unexplored to this day. In this study, we addressed the question of methodological precision by assessing the regional inter-subject variance and intra-subject reproducibility of the BOLD calibration parameter M, OEF, O-2 delivery and absolute CMRO2 estimates derived from a state-of-the-art calibrated BOLD technique, the QUantitative O-2 (QUO2) approach. We acquired simultaneous measurements of CBF and R2* at rest and during periods of hypercapnia (HC) and hyperoxia (HO) on two separate scan sessions within 24 hours using a clinical 3 T MRI scanner. Maps of M, OEF, oxygen delivery and CMRO2, were estimated from the measured end-tidal O-2, CBF0, CBFHC/HO and R2(HC/HO)*. Variability was assessed by computing the between-subject coefficients of variation (bwCV) and within-subject CV (wsCV) in seven ROIs. All tests GM-averaged values of CBF0, M, OEF, O-2 delivery and CMRO2 were: 49.5 +/- 6.4 mL/100 g/min, 4.69 +/- 0.91%, 0.37 +/- 0.06, 377 +/- 51 mu mol/100 g/min and 143 +/- 34 mu mol/100 g/min respectively. The variability of parameter estimates was found to be the lowest when averaged throughout all GM, with general trends toward higher CVs when averaged over smaller regions. Among the MRI measurements, the most reproducible across scans was R2(0)* (wsCV(GM) = 0.33%) along with CBF0 (wsCV(GM) = 3.88%) and R2(HC)* (wsCV(GM) = 6.7%). CBFHC and R2(HO)* were found to have a higher intra-subject variability (wsCV(GM) = 22.4% and wsCV(GM) = 16% respectively), which is likely due to propagation of random measurement errors, especially for CBFHC due to the low contrast-to-noise ratio intrinsic to ASL. Reproducibility of the QUO2 derived estimates were computed, yielding a GM intra-subject reproducibility of 3.87% for O-2 delivery, 16.8% for the M value, 13.6% for OEF and 15.2% for CMRO2. Although these results focus on the precision of the QUO2 method, rather than the accuracy, the information will be useful for calculation of statistical power in future validation studies and ultimately for research applications of the method. The higher test-retest variability for the more extensively modeled parameters (M, OEF, and CMRO2) highlights the need for further improvement of acquisition methods to reduce noise levels.

Thus, the identification of novel malaria biomarkers that could be utilized as diagnostic or therapeutic targets is becoming increasingly important. Using a proteomic approach, we previously identified unique biomarkers in the sera of malaria-infected individuals, including apolipoprotein E (ApoE). ApoE is the dominant apolipoprotein in the brain and has been implicated in several neurological disorders; therefore, we were interested in the potential role of ApoE in cerebral malaria. Here we report the first demonstration that cerebral malaria is markedly attenuated in ApoE(-/-) mice. The protection provided by the absence of ApoE was associated with decreased sequestration of parasites and T cells within the brain, and was determined to be independent from the involvement of ApoE receptors and from the altered lipid metabolism associated with the knockout mice. Importantly, we demonstrated that treatment of mice with the ApoE antagonist heparin octasaccharide significantly decreased the incidence of cerebral malaria. Overall, our study indicates that the reduction of ApoE could be utilized in the development of therapeutic treatments aimed at mitigating the neuropathology of cerebral malaria.

ELEGANS; AGRP NEURONS; ENERGY-BALANCE; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY; HYPOTHALAMIC AMPK; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; NEURAL CIRCUITS	The stress associated with starvation is accompanied by compensatory behaviours that enhance foraging efficiency and increase the probability of encountering food. However, the molecular details of how hunger triggers changes in the activity of neural circuits to elicit these adaptive behavioural outcomes remains to be resolved. We show here that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates neuronal activity to elicit appropriate behavioural outcomes in response to acute starvation, and this effect is mediated by the coordinated modulation of glutamatergic inputs. AMPK targets both the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 and the metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 in one of the primary circuits that governs behavioural response to food availability in C. elegans. Overall, our study suggests that AMPK acts as a molecular trigger in the specific starvation-sensitive neurons to modulate glutamatergic inputs and to elicit adaptive behavioural outputs in response to acute starvation.

In individuals with AS, mechanisms in the brain's visual area that underlie visual processing play a more prominent role in visual reasoning tasks than they do in normal individuals. In addition, increased connectivity with the visual area is thought to be one of the neural bases of autistic visual cognitive abilities. However, the contribution of such brain connectivity to visual cognitive abilities is not well understood, particularly in children. In this study, we investigated how functional connectivity between the visual areas and higher-order regions, which is reflected by alpha, beta and gamma band oscillations, contributes to the performance of visual reasoning tasks in typically developing (TD) (n = 18) children and AS children (n = 18). Brain activity was measured using a custom child-sized magneto-encephalograph. Imaginary coherence analysis was used as a proxy to estimate the functional connectivity between the occipital and other areas of the brain. Stronger connectivity from the occipital area, as evidenced by higher imaginary coherence in the gamma band, was associated with higher performance in the AS children only. We observed no significant correlation between the alpha or beta bands imaginary coherence and performance in the both groups. Alpha and beta bands reflect top-down pathways, while gamma band oscillations reflect a bottom-up influence. Therefore, our results suggest that visual reasoning in AS children is at least partially based on an enhanced reliance on visual perception and increased bottom-up connectivity from the visual areas.

Different stages of the metastatic cascade can also present distinct metabolic challenges to disseminating cancer cells. However, little is known regarding how changes in cellular metabolism, both within the cancer cell and the metastatic microenvironment, alter the ability of tumor cells to colonize and grow in distinct secondary sites. This review examines the concept of metabolic heterogeneity within the primary tumor, and how cancer cells are metabolically coupled with other cancer cells that comprise the tumor and cells within the tumor stroma. We examine how metabolic strategies, which are engaged by cancer cells in the primary site, change during the metastatic process. Finally, we discuss the metabolic adaptations that occur as cancer cells colonize foreign metastatic microenvironments and how cancer cells influence the metabolism of stromal cells at sites of metastasis. Through a discussion of these topics, it is clear that plasticity in tumor metabolic programs, which allows cancer cells to adapt and grow in hostile microenvironments, is emerging as an important variable that may change clinical approaches to managing metastatic disease.

P.; Lachaux, Jean-Philippe; Baillet, Sylvain; Jerbi, Karim			A multivariate method for estimating cross-frequency neuronal interactions and correcting linear mixing in MEG data, using canonical correlations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Multivariate analysis; Canonical correlation analysis; Cross-frequency coupling; Functional connectivity; Linear mixing correction	RANDOM-FIELD THEORY; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONY; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; GRANGER CAUSALITY; INVERSE METHODS	Background: Cross-frequency interactions between distinct brain areas have been observed in connection with a variety of cognitive tasks. With electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) data, typical connectivity measures between two brain regions analyze a single quantity from each region within a specific frequency band; given the wideband nature of EEG/MEG signals, many statistical tests may be required to identify true coupling. Furthermore, because of the poor spatial resolution of activity reconstructed from EEG/MEG, some interactions may actually be due to the linear mixing of brain sources. New method: In the present work, a method for the detection of cross-frequency functional connectivity in MEG data using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is described. We demonstrate that CCA identifies correlated signals and also the frequencies that cause the correlation. We also implement a procedure to deal with linear mixing based on symmetry properties of cross-covariance matrices. Results: Our tests with both simulated and real MEG data demonstrate that CCA is able to detect interacting locations and the frequencies that cause them, while accurately discarding spurious coupling. Comparison with existing methods: Recent techniques look at time delays in the activity between two locations to discard spurious interactions, while we propose a linear mixing model and demonstrate its relationship with symmetry aspects of cross-covariance matrices. Conclusions: Our tests indicate the benefits of the CCA approach in connectivity studies, as it allows the simultaneous evaluation of several possible combinations of cross-frequency interactions in a single statistical test.

To elucidate the relationship between these phenotypes, we used GABA(A) receptor gamma(2) subunit heterozygous (gamma(2+/-)) mice, which we previously characterized as a model animal with construct, face, and predictive validity for major depressive disorder. METHODS: To assess possible consequences of GABAergic deficits on glutamatergic transmission, we quantitated the cell surface expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors and the function of synapses in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex of gamma(2+/-) mice. We also analyzed the effects of an acute dose of the experimental antidepressant ketamine on all these parameters in gamma(2+/-) versus wild-type mice. RESULTS: Modest defects in GABAergic synaptic transmission of gamma(2+/-) mice resulted in a strikingly prominent homeostatic-like reduction in the cell surface expression of NMDA-type and AMPA-type glutamate receptors, along with prominent functional impairment of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. A single subanesthetic dose of ketamine normalized glutamate receptor expression and synaptic function of gamma(2+/-) mice to wildtype levels for a prolonged period, along with antidepressant-like behavioral consequences selectively in gamma(2+/-) mice. The GABAergic synapses of gamma(2+/-) mice were potentiated by ketamine in parallel but only in the medial prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive-like brain states that are caused by GABAergic deficits involve a homeostatic-like reduction of glutamatergic transmission that is reversible by an acute, subanesthetic dose of ketamine, along with regionally selective potentiation of GABAergic synapses. The data merge the GABAergic and glutamatergic deficit hypotheses of major depressive disorder.

Rather, it appears that mitochondrial dysfunction itself and the signaling function of mtROS can have positive effects on lifespan, helping to extend longevity. If events in the mitochondria can lead to better cellular homeostasis and better survival of the organism in ways beyond providing ATP and biosynthetic products, we can conjecture that they act on other cellular components through appropriate signaling pathways. We describe recent advances in a variety of species which promoted our understanding of how changes of mtROS generation are part of a system of signaling pathways that emanate from the mitochondria to impact organism lifespan through global changes, including in transcriptional patterns. In unraveling this, many old players in cellular homeostasis were encountered. Among these, maybe most strikingly, is the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, which is the conduit by which at least one class of mtROS exercise their actions in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This is a pathway that normally contributes to organismal homeostasis by killing defective or otherwise unwanted cells, and whose various compounds have also been implicated in other cellular processes. However, it was a surprise that that appropriate activation of a cell killing pathway can in fact prolong the lifespan of the organism. In the soma of adult C. elegans, all cells are post-mitotic, like many of our neurons and possibly some of our immune cells. These cells cannot simply be killed and replaced when showing signs of dysfunction. Thus, we speculate that it is the ability of the apoptotic pathway to pull together information about the functional and structural integrity of different cellular compartments that is the key property for why this pathway is used to decide when to boost defensive and repair processes in irreplaceable cells. When this process is artificially stimulated in mutants with elevated mtROS generation or with drug treatments it leads to lifespan prolongations beyond the normal lifespan of the organism.

PRIMA-1(MET)/APR-246, emerged as a promising compound to rescuwe wild-type (wt) p53 function in different cancer types. Previous studies suggested the role of wtp53 in the negative regulation of the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a major determinant in resistance to therapy in GBM treatment. The potential role of MGMT in expression of p53 and the efficacy of PRIMA-1(MET) with respect to TP53 status and expression of MGMT in GBM remain unknown. We investigated response to PRIMA-1(MET) of wtp53/MGMT-negative (U87MG, A172), mutp53/MGMT-positive U138, LN-18, T98/Empty vector (T98/EV) and its isogenic MGMT/shRNA gene knockdown counterpart (T98/shRNA). We show that MGMT silencing decreased expression of mutp53/GOF in T98/shRNA. PRIMA-1(MET) further cleared T98/shRNA cells of mutp53, decreased proliferation and clonogenic potential, abrogated the G(2) checkpoint control, increased susceptibility to apoptotic cell death, expression of GADD45A and sustained expression of phosphorylated Erk1/2. PRIMA-1(MET) increased expression of p21 protein in U87MG and A172 and promoted senescence in U87MG cell line. Importantly, PRIMA-1(MET) decreased relative cell numbers, disrupted the structure of neurospheres of patient-derived GBM stem cells (GSCs) and enabled activation of wtp53 with decreased expression of MGMT in MGMT-positive GSCs or decreased expression of mutp53. Our findings highlight the cell-context dependent effects of PRIMA-1(MET) irrespective of p53 status and suggest the role of MGMT as a potential molecular target of PRIMA-1(MET) in MGMT-positive GSCs.

Exons 1A and 1B encode alternative 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) that splice to exon 2 encoding the AUG initiation codon. Exons 2-7 encode the CaSR protein of 1078 amino acids. Promoter P1 has TATA and CCAAT boxes upstream of exon 1A, and promoter P2 has Sp1/3 motifs at the start site of exon 1B. Exon 1A transcripts from the P1 promoter are reduced in parathyroid tumors and colon carcinomas. Studies of colon carcinomas and neuroblastomas have emphasized the importance of epigenetic changes-promoter methylation of the GC-rich P2 promoter, histone acetylation-as well as involvement of microRNAs in bringing about CASR gene silencing and reduced CaSR expression. Functional cis-elements in the CASR promoters responsive to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D], proinflammatory cytokines, and the transcription factor glial cells missing-2 (GCM2) have been characterized. Reduced levels of CaSR and reduced responsiveness to active vitamin D in parathyroid neoplasia and colon carcinoma may blunt the "tumor suppressor" activity of the CaSR. The hypocalcemia of critically ill patients with burn injury or sepsis is associated with CASR gene upregulation by TNF-alpha and IL-1beta via kappaB elements, and by IL-6 via Stat1/3 and Sp1/3 elements in the CASR gene promoters, respectively. The CASR is transactivated by GCM2-the expression of which is essential for parathyroid gland development. Hyperactive forms of GCM2 may contribute to later parathyroid hyperactivity or tumorigenesis. The expression of the CaSR-the calciostat-is regulated physiologically and pathophysiologically at the gene level.

Methods In a prospective Singaporean birth cohort study, pregnant women were screened for gestational diabetes at 26-28 weeks gestation using a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Four hundred and seventy three children (n = 74 and n = 399 born to mothers with and without gestational diabetes respectively) underwent neurocognitive assessments at 6, 18, and/or 24 month, including electrophysiology during an attentional task and behavioral measures of attention, memory and cognition. Results Gestational diabetes is related to left hemisphere EPmax amplitude differences (oddball versus standard) at both six (P = 0.039) and eighteen months (P = 0.039), with mean amplitudes suggesting offspring of mothers with gestational diabetes exhibit greater neuronal activity to standard stimuli and less to oddball stimuli. Associations between 2-hour maternal glucose levels and the difference in EPmax amplitude were marginal at 6 months [adjusted beta = -0.19 (95% CI: -0.42 to +0.04) mu V, P = 0.100] and significant at 18 months [adjusted beta = -0.27 (95% CI: -0.49 to -0.06) mu V, P = 0.014], and the EPmax amplitude difference (oddball-standard) associated with the Bayley Scales of Infant and toddler Development-III cognitive score at 24 months [beta = 0.598 (95% CI: 0.158 to 1.038), P = 0.008]. Conclusion Gestational diabetes and maternal blood glucose levels are associated with offspring neuronal activity during an attentional task at both six and eighteen months. Such electrophysiological differences are likely functionally important, having been previously linked to attention problems later in life.

The heritability estimates of subcortical regions ranged from 0.41 (amygdala) to 0.73 (hippocampus), and of cortical regions, from 0.55 (parietal lobe) to 0.78 (frontal lobe). Corresponding structures in the two hemispheres were influenced by the same genetic factors and high genetic correlations were observed between the two hemispheric regions. There were three genetically correlated clusters, comprising (i) the cortical lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes); (ii) the basal ganglia (caudate, putamen and pallidum) with weak genetic correlations with cortical lobes, and (iii) the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens grouped together, which genetically correlated with both basal ganglia and cortical lobes, albeit relatively weakly. Our study demonstrates a complex but patterned and clustered genetic architecture of the human brain, with divergent genetic determinants of cortical and subcortical structures, in particular the basal ganglia.

Interestingly, both the rewarding and aversive effects of nicotine are probably critical for sustaining nicotine addiction. The medial and lateral habenular (LHb) nuclei play important roles in processing aversion, and recent work has focused on the critical involvement of the LHb in encoding and responding to aversive stimuli. Several neurotransmitter systems are implicated in nicotine's actions, but very little is known about how nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) regulate LHb activity. Here we report in brain slices that activation of nAChRs depolarizes LHb cells and robustly increases firing, and also potentiates glutamate release in LHb. These effects were blocked by selective antagonists of alpha 6-containing (alpha 6*) nAChRs, and were absent in alpha 6*-nAChR knockout mice. In addition, nicotine activates GABAergic inputs to LHb via alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs, at lower concentrations but with more rapid desensitization relative to alpha 6*-nAChRs. These results demonstrate the existence of diverse functional nAChR subtypes at presynaptic and postsynaptic sites in LHb, through which nicotine could facilitate or inhibit LHb neuronal activity and thus contribute to nicotine aversion or reward.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of major PAD, and its different presentations, on the 10-year risk of death, major macrovascular events, and major clinical microvascular events in these patients. Methods: Participants in the action in diabetes and vascular disease: PreterAx and DiamicroN modified-release controlled evaluation (ADVANCE) trial and the ADVANCE-ON post-trial study were followed for a median of 5.0 (in-trial), 5.4 (post-trial), and 9.9 (overall) years. Major PAD at baseline was subdivided into lower-extremity chronic ulceration or amputation secondary to vascular disease and history of peripheral revascularization by angioplasty or surgery. Results: Among 11,140 participants, 516 (4.6 %) had major PAD at baseline: 300 (2.7 %) had lower-extremity ulceration or amputation alone, 190 (1.7 %) had peripheral revascularization alone, and 26 (0.2 %) had both presentations. All-cause mortality, major macrovascular events, and major clinical microvascular events occurred in 2265 (20.3 %), 2166 (19.4 %), and 807 (7.2 %) participants, respectively. Compared to those without PAD, patients with major PAD had increased rates of all-cause mortality (HR 1.35, 95 % Cl 1.15-1.60, p = 0.0004), and major macrovascular events (1.47 [1.23-1.75], p < 0.0001), after multiple adjustments for region of origin, cardiovascular risk factors and treatments, peripheral neuropathy markers, and randomized treatments. We have also observed a trend toward an association of baseline PAD with risk of major clinical microvascular events [1.31 (0.96-1.78), p = 0.09]. These associations were comparable for patients with a lower-extremity ulceration or amputation and for those with a history of peripheral revascularization. Furthermore, the risk of retinal photocoagulation or blindness, but not renal events, increased in patients with lower-extremity ulceration or amputation [1.53 (1.01-2.30), p = 0.04]. Conclusions: Lower-extremity ulceration or amputation, and peripheral revascularization both increased the risks of death and cardiovascular events, but only lower-extremity ulceration or amputation increased the risk of severe retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Screening for major PAD and its management remain crucial for cardiovascular prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes (ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT00949286).

The patients have pronounced limitations in cognitive ability, motor skills and adaptive behaviour. However, the mechanistic basis for this disorder is poorly understood as few of the more than 20 mutations identified thus far have been studied in detail. Methods: Here, we examined the molecular and cellular consequences of a 6 base-pair deletion of amino acids Glu(287) and Ser(288) (Delta ES) in the predicted seventh transmembrane helix of human NHE6 expressed in established cell lines (CHO/AP-1, HeLa and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y) and primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons by measuring levels of protein expression, stability, membrane trafficking, endosomal function and cell viability. Results: In the cell lines, immunoblot analyses showed that the nascent mutant protein was properly synthesized and assembled as a homodimer, but its oligosaccharide maturation and half-life were markedly reduced compared to wild-type (WT) and correlated with enhanced ubiquitination leading to both proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. Despite this instability, a measurable fraction of the transporter was correctly sorted to the plasma membrane. However, the rates of clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the Delta ES mutant as well as uptake of companion vesicular cargo, such as the ligand-bound transferrin receptor, were significantly reduced and correlated with excessive endosomal acidification. Notably, ectopic expression of Delta ES but not WT induced apoptosis when examined in AP-1 cells. Similarly, in transfected primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons, membrane trafficking of the Delta ES mutant was impaired and elicited marked reductions in total dendritic length, area and arborization, and triggered apoptotic cell death. Conclusions: These results suggest that loss-of-function mutations in NHE6 disrupt recycling endosomal function and trafficking of cargo which ultimately leads to neuronal degeneration and cell death in Christianson Syndrome.

Patients with severe TBI must be managed rapidly and efficiently to minimize secondary brain injury potentially leading to permanent sequelae. This is especially important in young patients, whose brain is still in development, making them particularly susceptible to secondary insults. The complexity of both brain injury pathophysiology and the intensive care unit environment makes the management of these patients challenging, with a risk of delayed response and/or patient instability contributing to worsened outcome. Computerized assistance in TBI appears likely to improve patient management, by helping clinicians quickly analyze and respond to ongoing clinical changes and optimizing patient status by guiding management. Currently, computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) do not feature continuous medical assistance with individualized treatment plans. This review presents new developments in CDSSs specialized in TBI. We also present the framework for future CDSSs needed to improve TBI management in real time, taking into account individual patient characteristics.

However, several factors make the interpretation of the chest radiograph difficult including the number of X-rays done daily in ICU, the quality of the chest radiograph, and the lack of a standardized interpretation. To overcome these limitations in the interpretation of chest radiographs, researchers have developed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In this review, the authors report the methodology used to develop CAD systems including identification of the region of interest, analysis of these regions, and classification. Currently, only a few CAD systems for chest X-ray interpretation are commercially available. Some promising research is ongoing, but the involvement of the pediatric research community is needed for the development and validation of such CAD systems dedicated to pediatric intensive care.

To investigate the perceived contrast summation of the responses to component gratings in plaids, we compared the apparent contrasts of monocular plaids to a component grating presented alone across chromaticity and spatial frequency. Observers performed a contrast-matching task for red-green color and luminance stimuli at low-and medium-spatial frequencies. Using the measured points of subjective equality between plaids and gratings, we evaluate perceived contrast summation across conditions, which may vary between 1 (no summation) and 2 (full summation). We show that achromatic plaids have higher perceived contrast summation than chromatic plaids. The greatest difference occurs at the medium-spatial frequency, with summation highest for achromatic plaids (1.87) and lowest for chromatic plaids (1.49), while at low-spatial frequencies, there is a smaller summation difference between achromatic (1.72) and chromatic (1.65) plaids. These results are consistent with recent theories of distinct cross-orientation suppression and summation mechanisms in color and luminance vision. Two control experiments for binocular versus monocular viewing, and the overall size of the stimulus patches did not reveal any differences from our main results.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five eyes of 25 subjects with RP who underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) using the Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) were analyzed retrospectively. A control group of 67 eyes of 48 age-matched healthy volunteers was also included for comparison. Average, minimum, and sectoral macular GCIPL, as well as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and outer retinal (OR) thicknesses, were collected and compared between RP and control groups. RESULTS: The average and sectoral macular GCIPL thicknesses were significantly reduced in RP eyes compared with controls (P < .0001). Average macular RNFL thickness was reduced in RP eyes compared with controls (P < .054). CONCLUSIONS: In eyes with RP, display reduced GCIPL, RNFL, and OR thickness. The identification of alteration in RNFL, OR, and GCIPL thickness may be useful for future therapeutic implications.

The subsecond dynamics of sensory modulation of serotonin levels and its relation to behavior, however, remain unknown. We used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure serotonin release in the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus. These fish use an electric organ to generate a quasi-sinusoidal electric field for communicating with conspecifics. In response to conspecific signals, they frequently produce signal modulations called chirps. We measured changes in serotonin concentration in the hindbrain electrosensory lobe (ELL) with a resolution of 0.1 s concurrently with chirping behavior evoked by mimics of conspecific electric signals. We show that serotonin release can occur phase locked to stimulus onset as well as spontaneously in the ELL region responsible for processing these signals. Intense auditory stimuli, on the other hand, do not modulate serotonin levels in this region, suggesting modality specificity. We found no significant correlation between serotonin release and chirp production on a trial-by-trial basis. However, on average, in the trials where the fish chirped, there was a reduction in serotonin release in response to stimuli mimicking similar-sized same-sex conspecifics. We hypothesize that the serotonergic system is part of an intricate sensory-motor loop: serotonin release in a sensory area is triggered by sensory input, giving rise to motor output, which can in turn affect serotonin release at the timescale of the ongoing sensory experience and in a context-dependent manner.

Animal studies using STN-DBS, lesioning, or inactivation of STN neurons have been used extensively alongside clinical studies to unravel the structural organization, circuitry, and function of the STN. Recent studies in rodent STN models have exposed different roles for STN neurons in reward-related functions. We have previously shown that the majority of STN neurons express the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 gene (Vglut2/Slc17a6) and that reduction of Vglut2 mRNA levels within the STN of mice [conditional knockout (cKO)] causes reduced postsynaptic activity and behavioral hyperlocomotion. The cKO mice showed less interest in fatty rewards, which motivated analysis of reward-response. The current results demonstrate decreased sugar consumption and strong rearing behavior, whereas biochemical analyses show altered dopaminergic and peptidergic activity in the striatum. The behavioral alterations were in fact correlated with opposite effects in the dorsal versus the ventral striatum. Significant cell loss and disorganization of the STN structure was identified, which likely accounts for the observed alterations. Rare genetic variants of the human VGLUT2 gene exist, and this study shows that reduced Vglut2/Slc17a6 gene expression levels exclusively within the STN of mice is sufficient to cause strong modifications in both the STN and the mesostriatal dopamine system.

However, it is not known whether more diffuse pharmacological stimulation with donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is an efficient tool for enhancing visual processing and perception. The goal of the present study was to potentiate cholinergic transmission with donepezil treatment (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) during a 2-week visual training to examine the effect on visually evoked potentials and to profile the expression of cholinergic receptor subtypes. The visual training was performed daily, 10 min a day, for 2 weeks. One week after the last training session, visual evoked potentials were recorded, or the mRNA expression level of muscarinic (M1-5) and nicotinic (alpha/beta) receptors subunits was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The visual stimulation coupled with any of the two doses of donepezil produced significant amplitude enhancement of cortical evoked potentials compared to pre-training values. The enhancement induced by the 1 mg/kg dose of donepezil was spread to neighboring spatial frequencies, suggesting a better sensitivity near the visual detection threshold. The M3, M4, M5 and alpha 7 receptors mRNA were upregulated in the visual cortex for the higher dose of donepezil but not the lower one, and the receptors expression was stable in the somatosensory (non-visual control) cortex. Therefore, higher levels of acetylcholine within the cortex sustain the increased intensity of the cortical response and trigger the upregulation of cholinergic receptors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the role of childhood EF in ILS during adolescence/early adulthood in females with FXS and two comparison groups in the same age range (matched for IQ [IQ/Age group] and with another genetic condition, Turner syndrome [TS group]). EF and ILS were significantly higher for the FXS group than the IQ/Age group but did not differ from the TS group. For the FXS group, age and EF were significant predictors of ILS during adolescence/early adulthood, but there were no statistically significant longitudinal associations between EF and ILS. Our findings suggest that impairments in EF may have a significant effect on ILS in FXS.

A dynamic process modeling approach was adopted to determine parameter interactions. A bioreactor model was integrated with an artificial neural network that describes biomass and product formation rates as function of varied fed-batch fermentation conditions for heterologous protein production. A model reliability measure was introduced to assess in which process region the model can be expected to predict process states accurately. It was found that the model could accurately predict process states of multiple fermentations performed at fixed conditions within the determined validity domain. The results suggest that intraexperimental variations of process conditions could be used to reduce the number of experiments by a factor, which in limit would be equivalent to the number of intraexperimental variations per experiment.

Surprisingly, we found that almost no study addressed drug-based management in the postoperative period. Dopaminergic medications are usually reduced, but whether the levodopa or dopamine agonist is to be reduced is left to the personal preference of the treating physician. We have summarized the pros and cons of both approaches. No study on the management of cognitive problems after DBS has been done, and only a few studies have explored the pharmacological management of such DBS-resistant symptoms as voice (amantadine), balance (donepezil) or gait disorders (amantadine, methylphenidate). As for the psychiatric problems so frequently reported in PD patients, researchers have directed their attention to the complex interplay between stimulation and reduction of dopaminergic drugs only recently. In conclusion, studies addressing medical management following DBS are still needed and will certainly contribute to the ultimate success of DBS procedures.

Available in multiple languages and for use in multiple countries worldwide, the goal of this study was to validate the alternate versions 2 and 3 of the French MoCA test to assist physicians in the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), while decreasing the learning effect upon frequent testing. Methods: A validation study was conducted at the MoCA Clinic and Institute in Quebec, Canada. The subject population consisted of 25 patients diagnosed with MCI meeting Petersen criteria and 25 healthy subjects serving as the normal control (NC) group. Three MoCA test versions were administered in the French language in random order within one session. Scores obtained in all three versions in MCI and NC groups were assessed for reliability and consistency from one version to the next. Results: On average, scores obtained in each subject group (MCI and NC) fell within their corresponding diagnostic ranges (score above 26 points for NC patients versus scores below 26 points for MCI patients). Difference in scores observed between the original French MoCA version and the two alternate versions in each subject cohort were minimal and not considered clinically significant. Conclusions: All three test versions of the French MoCA are considered equivalent in diagnostic reliability and consistency and contribute to decreasing the potential learning effect when patients are required to repeat the test frequently.

A beat-tracking algorithm extracted the periodic relations between stressed syllables (beats) from acoustic recordings. The mean interbeat interval (IBI) between successive stressed syllables was compared across speech rates. Participants' IBIs were smaller in the fast condition than in the slowcondition; the difference between participants' and the confederate's IBIs decreased across utterances. Cross-correlational analyses demonstrated mutual influences between speakers, with greater impact of the confederate on participants' beat rates than vice versa. Beat rates converged in scripted conversations, suggesting speakers mutually entrain to one another's beat.

Detailed pulmonary function tests and sensory-mechanical relationships during incremental exercise with respiratory pressure measurements and diaphragmatic electromyography (EMGdi) were compared in 20 smokers without spirometric COPD and 20 age-matched healthy controls. Smokers (mean +/- SD post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity 75 +/- 4%, mean +/- SD FEV1 104 +/- 14% predicted) had greater activity-related dyspnoea, poorer health status and lower physical activity than controls. Smokers had peripheral airway dysfunction: higher phase-III nitrogen slopes (3.8 +/- 1.8 versus 2.6 +/- 1.1% . L-1) and airway resistance (difference between airway resistance measured at 5 Hz and 20 Hz 19 +/- 11 versus 12 +/- 7% at 5 Hz) than controls (p<0.05). Smokers had significantly (p<0.05) lower peak oxygen uptake (78 +/- 40 versus 107 +/- 45% predicted) and ventilation (61 +/- 26 versus 97 +/- 29 L.min(-1)). Exercise ventilatory requirements, operating lung volumes and cardio-circulatory responses were similar. However, submaximal dyspnoea ratings, resistive and total work of breathing were increased in smokers compared with controls (p<0.05); diaphragmatic effort (transdiaphragmatic pressure/maximumal transdiaphragmatic pressure) and fractional inspiratory neural drive to the diaphragm (EMGdi/maximal EMGdi) were also increased (p<0.05) mainly reflecting the reduced denominator. Symptomatic smokers at risk for COPD had greater exertional dyspnoea and lower exercise tolerance compared with healthy controls in association with greater airways resistance, contractile diaphragmatic effort and fractional inspiratory neural drive to the diaphragm.

These residual cancer cells give rise to recurrences. In vivo Raman spectroscopy can detect these invasive cancer cells in patients with grade 2 to 4 gliomas. The robustness of this Raman signal can be dampened by spectral artifacts generated by lights in the operating room. We found that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can overcome these spectral artifacts using nonparametric and adaptive models to detect complex non-linear spectral characteristics. Coupling ANN with Raman spectroscopy simplifies the intraoperative use of Raman spectroscopy by limiting changes required to the standard neurosurgical workflow. The ability to detect invasive brain cancer under these conditions may reduce residual cancer remaining after surgery and improve patient survival.

The unconscious, myth, and the rule of law: Reflections on the persistence of gender inequality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						The end of history; Agency; Group mind; Repression; Collective neuroses; Patriarchy	EVOLUTION	Social order, to remain stable, needs the voluntary compliance of the majority of the population. Such consent requires normative justification. The rational foundation of the rule of law and the democratic state rests on the presumption of the equality of every citizen. Male domination of females nevertheless remains universal even in the most advanced democratic nation states because it is legitimized by the shared assumption that patriarchy reflects the will of God or is dictated by nature. Freud's diagnosis of patriarchy as a collective neurosis of the group mind negates every possible normative justification that can be made for gender hierarchy. Freud made extensive references to myth in developing his analysis of the neurotic foundations of social order. An analysis of the structure of myth suggests that ideological seduction rather than God, nature or biology determines male dominance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Smith, J.

Characterization of Burning Mouth Syndrome in Patients with Parkinson's Disease	JOURNAL OF ORAL & FACIAL PAIN AND HEADACHE			English	Article						burning mouth syndrome; oral pain; Parkinson's disease	PAIN THRESHOLD; DOPAMINE; LEVODOPA; NEUROPATHY; SYSTEM	Aims: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of burning mouth syndrome (BMS) in a Parkinson's disease (PD) population through a self-administered, custom-made survey. Methods: A total of 218 surveys were collected during regular outpatient visits at two Movement Disorders Clinics in Montreal (Canada) and Toulouse (France) to gather information about pain experience, PD-related symptoms, and oral and general health. A neurologist confirmed the diagnosis of PD, drug treatment, Hoehn-Yahr stage, and Schwab & England Activity of Daily Living score. Data between groups were compared using the independent samples Mann-Whitney U test and two-sided exact Fisher test. Results: Data from 203 surveys were analyzed. BMS was reported by eight subjects (seven females and one male), resulting in a prevalence of 4.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-7.8). Five participants with chronic nonburning oral pain were excluded. PD severity and levodopa equivalent daily dose did not differ between non-BMS and BMS participants. Mean poor oral health index was higher in BMS compared to non-BMS subjects (49.0 vs 32.2 points, P<.05). BMS manifested after PD onset in seven patients, did not occur on a daily basis in four, and always coexisted with restless legs syndrome. Conclusion: This survey yielded a low prevalence of BMS in PD patients, indicating no strong link between the two conditions. An augmenting effect such as that resulting from drug treatment in restless legs syndrome or sensory neuropathy cannot be excluded.

Unfortunately, it is also an acute neurotoxic compound to both insects and mammals, including humans, and has been responsible for many severe poisonings and several fatal cases. Endosulfan also imitates or enhances the effect of the female hormone estrogen, having the capability of causing reproductive and developmental damage in both, animals and humans, and its exposure has been linked to liver tissue injury. This persistent lipophilic compound is one of the most abundant organochlorine pesticides in the environment, capable of undergoing long range transport to remote locations such as the Arctic. It is practically water-insoluble, but readily adheres to clay particles and persists in soil and water for several years. Its indiscriminate and injudicious use in the control of insects on a wide range of agricultural products and in the extermination of household pests, has considerably increased the hazard risk for human health. Also, this compound has a high fatality rate in humans when ingested accidentally, from food or water contaminated, or in suicidal cases. The aim of this article is to review and summarize chemical, biochemical, environmental, and toxicological data of endosulfan and draw attention to its toxicological potential risk to human health.

However, a standardized objective definition of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis has been lacking. The aim of this work was to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of an objective definition for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, to enable comparability of future research studies. Using MSBase, a large, prospectively acquired, global cohort study, we analysed the accuracy of 576 data-derived onset definitions for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and first compared these to a consensus opinion of three neurologists. All definitions were then evaluated against 5-year disease outcomes post-assignment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: sustained disability, subsequent sustained progression, positive disability trajectory, and accumulation of severe disability. The five best performing definitions were further investigated for their timeliness and overall disability burden. A total of 17 356 patients were analysed. The best definition included a 3-strata progression magnitude in the absence of a relapse, confirmed after 3 months within the leading Functional System and required an Expanded Disability Status Scale step 54 and pyramidal score 52. It reached an accuracy of 87% compared to the consensus diagnosis. Seventy-eight per cent of the identified patients showed a positive disability trajectory and 70% reached significant disability after 5 years. The time until half of all patients were diagnosed was 32.6 years (95% confidence interval 32-33.6) after disease onset compared with the physicians' diagnosis at 36 (35-39) years. The identified patients experienced a greater disease burden [median annualized area under the disability-time curve 4.7 (quartiles 3.6, 6.0)] versus non-progressive patients [1.8 (1.2, 1.9)]. This objective definition of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale and information about preceding relapses provides a tool for a reproducible, accurate and timely diagnosis that requires a very short confirmation period. If applied broadly, the definition has the potential to strengthen the design and improve comparability of clinical trials and observational studies in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.

Using multi-modal 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we mapped the topography of superficial white matter diffusion alterations in 61 consecutive temporal lobe epilepsy patients relative to 38 healthy controls and studied the relationship to large-scale structural as well as functional networks. Our approach continuously sampled mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy along surfaces running 2 mm below the cortex. Multivariate statistics mapped superficial white matter diffusion anomalies in patients relative to controls, while correlation and mediation analyses evaluated their relationship to structural (cortical thickness, mesiotemporal volumetry) and functional parameters (resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging amplitude) and clinical variables. Patients presented with overlapping anomalies in mean diffusivity and anisotropy, particularly in ipsilateral temporo-limbic regions. Diffusion anomalies did not relate to cortical thinning; conversely, they mediated large-scale functional amplitude decreases in patients relative to controls in default mode hub regions (i.e. anterior and posterior midline regions, lateral temporo-parietal cortices), and were themselves mediated by hippocampal atrophy. With respect to clinical variables, we observed more marked diffusion anomalies in patients with a history of febrile convulsions and those with longer disease duration. Similarly, more marked diffusion alterations were associated with seizure-free outcome. Bootstrap analyses indicated high reproducibility of our findings, suggesting generalizability. The temporo-limbic distribution of superficial white matter anomalies, together with the mediation-level findings, suggests that this so far neglected region serves a key link between the hippocampal atrophy and large-scale default mode network alterations in temporal lobe epilepsy.

In this paper, we describe the novel application of a deep learning method to the automatic identification of predatory chat conversations in large volumes of chat logs. We present a classifier based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to address this problem domain. The proposed CNN architecture outperforms other classification techniques that are common in this domain including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and regular Neural Network (NN) in terms of classification performance, which is measured by F-1-score. In addition, our experiments show that using existing pre-trained word vectors are not suitable for this specific domain. Furthermore, since the learning algorithm runs in a massively parallel environment (i.e., general-purpose GPU), the approach can benefit a large number of computation units (neurons) compared to when CPU is used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that CNNs are adapted and applied to this application domain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PHYSIOTHERAPY CANADA			English	Article						inter-professional relations; low back pain; private sector; survey	INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION; PHYSICAL-THERAPY; HEALTH; ADULTS; MODEL	Purpose: Although there have been increasing demands for health care providers to take part in inter-professional practices in recent years, very little attention has been paid to the actualization of such practices in the private sector. This study describes private-sector physiotherapists' inter-professional practices regarding low back pain (LBP) management and identifies organizational and provider-level variables associated with the intensity of such practices. Method: A total of 327 randomly selected physiotherapists were surveyed in the province of Quebec. Data were analyzed using descriptive and multiple regression analyses. Results: Physiotherapists reported frequent interactions with other physiotherapists (daily/weekly for 52.6%), family physicians (51.0%), and physiotherapy (PT) assistants (45.2%), but infrequent interactions with psychologists (3.6%), neurosurgeons (0.9%), and chiropractors (0.3%). Frequently reported means of interactions were written and oral messages sent through clients (55.1% and 24.1%, respectively), face-to-face unplanned discussions (41.9%), and faxed or mailed letters (23.2%). Variables associated with the intensity of inter-professional practices (mean of 6.7 [SD 1.7] out of 10 on the Intensity of Interprofessional Practices Questionnaire for Private Sector Physiotherapists) were related to physiotherapists' clientele, social activities with other providers, and perceptions of inter-professional practices as well as organizational models, vision, and provision of PT training. Conclusions: There is room to improve inter-professional practices with private-sector physiotherapists involved in managing LBP. Targets for action include physiotherapists and their workplaces.

Weekly nab-Paclitaxel in Combination With Carboplatin as First-Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Analysis of Safety and Efficacy in Patients With Diabetes	CLINICAL LUNG CANCER			English	Article						Comorbidities; Neuropathy; Taxanes	SOLVENT-BASED PACLITAXEL; BREAST-CANCER; MELLITUS; CHEMOTHERAPY; SURVIVAL; GLUCOSE; DEXAMETHASONE; NEOADJUVANT; METFORMIN; SURGERY	The association between diabetes and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear. Therapy with nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin (nab-P/C) improved the primary end point (overall response rate) versus solvent-based paclitaxel plus carboplatin (sb-P/C) in the overall population and in a subset of patients with diabetes in a phase 3 trial of advanced NSCLC. Rate of neuropathy was lower with nab-P/C versus sb-P/C. nab-P/C is preferable for patients with NSCLC and diabetes. Purpose: To examine outcomes in a phase 3 trial of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin (nab-P/C) versus solvent-based paclitaxel plus carboplatin (sb-P/C) in a subset of patients with advanced non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and diabetes. Patients and Methods: Patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC received nab-P 100 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 or sb-P 200 mg/m(2) on day 1, both with C at an area under the curve of 6 mg.min/mL on day 1 every 3 weeks. Overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined by blinded, independent, centralized review. P values were based on chi-square test for ORR and log-rank test for overall survival (OS) and PFS. Results: Of the 1052 randomized patients in the phase 3 trial, 61 had diabetes according to prespecified terms (nab-P/C, 31; sb-P/C, 30). ORR for nab-P/C versus sb-P/C in this subset was 52% versus 27% (relative risk ratio, 1.935; P = .046), median PFS was 10.9 versus 4.9 months (hazard ratio, 0.420; P = .016), and median OS was 17.5 versus 11.1 months (hazard ratio, 0.550; P = .057). Treatment differences in PFS remained significant (P <= .036) after adjusting for histology, region, stage, race, and age and also remained significant in OS for histology (P = .039). Patients with diabetes experienced lower rates of grade 3 or higher neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and anemia with nab-P/C versus sb-P/C. Conclusion: nab-P/C demonstrated improved efficacy and manageable tolerability in patients with advanced NSCLC and diabetes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Active sensing without efference copy: referent control of perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						position sense; visual space constancy; phantom limb; motor control; kinesthetic illusions	STRETCH REFLEX; EYE-MOVEMENTS; PROPRIOCEPTIVE FEEDBACK; CORTICOSPINAL CONTROL; EXTRAOCULAR-MUSCLES; ANTAGONIST MUSCLES; THRESHOLD CONTROL; DECEREBRATE CAT; PHANTOM LIMBS; HUMAN WALKING	Although action and perception are different behaviors, they are likely to be interrelated, as implied by the notions of perception-action coupling and active sensing. Traditionally, it has been assumed that the nervous system directly preprograms motor commands required for actions and uses a copy of them called efference copy (EC) to also influence our senses. This review offers a critical analysis of the EC concept by identifying its limitations. An alternative to the EC concept is based on the experimentally confirmed notion that sensory signals from receptors are perceived relative to referent signals specified by the brain. These referents also underlie the control of motor actions by predetermining where, in the spatial domain, muscles can work without preprogramming how they should work in terms of motor commands or EC. This approach helps solve several problems of action and explain several sensory experiences, including position sense and the sense that the world remains stationary despite changes in its retinal image during eye or body motion (visual space constancy). The phantom limb phenomenon and other kinesthetic illusions are also explained within this framework.

Pregnancy in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis: a case series	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM REPORTS			English	Article						Elosulfase alfa; Enzyme replacement therapy; Mucopolysaccharidoses; Pregnancy	ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY; HEART-DISEASE; LARONIDASE; EFFICACY; SAFETY; WOMEN	The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS disorders) are rare inherited diseases associated with multi-organ accumulation of glycosaminoglycans, leading to musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiac, neurological, ophthalmological, otolaryngological, and gastrointestinal abnormalities. As a result of improvements in diagnosis, multi-disciplinary care, and therapies such as enzyme replacement therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, an increasing number of patients with MPS are reaching adulthood and are involved in family planning. Data on fertility and pregnancy outcome in MPS is sparse and comprises primarily isolated case reports. To address this evidence gap, we present a case series on fertility and pregnancy in eight mothers and five fathers with MPS. This case series demonstrates that women with MPS have high-risk pregnancies and deliveries secondary to their underlying disease. However, with appropriate pre-conceptual multi-disciplinary evaluation, optimization and discussion regarding potential risks, combined with regular multi-disciplinary maternal and fetal surveillance in a tertiary center, the outcome of most pregnancies in this case series seems to be favorable with all babies developing normally. Partners of fathers with MPS had uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. All children were healthy, with normal growth and development. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The reciprocal associations between catastrophizing and pain outcomes in patients being treated for neuropathic pain: a cross-lagged panel analysis study	PAIN			English	Article						Neuropathic pain; Catastrophizing; Pain intensity; Pain-related interference; Cross-lagged panel analysis; Longitudinal study; Tertiary care	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; LOW-BACK-PAIN; MULTIDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT; PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; PSYCHOLOGICAL-ASPECTS; COPING STRATEGIES; SCALE; TERM; VALIDATION; PREDICTORS	Catastrophizing is recognized as a key psychosocial factor associated with pain-related negative outcomes in individuals with chronic pain. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the temporal relationship between these constructs. The aim of this study was to determine if changes in catastrophizing early in treatment predicted subsequent changes in pain intensity and interference later in treatment, or alternately, if early changes in pain intensity and interference predicted subsequent changes in catastrophizing. A total of 538 patients with neuropathic pain were recruited from 6 multidisciplinary pain clinics across Canada. Study participants were asked to complete measures of catastrophizing, pain intensity, and interference when first seen in the clinic and then again at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Cross-lagged panel analyses were used to determine the temporal associations among the study variables. The results showed that decreases in catastrophizing early in treatment prospectively predicted improvement in both pain intensity and interference later in treatment. Converse temporal relationships were also found, where a reduction in pain intensity and interference early in treatment predicted a subsequent diminishing of catastrophizing. All 4 unique cross-lagged correlations significantly accounted for an additional 4% to 7% of the total variance. The findings are consistent with theoretical models hypothesizing a causal impact of catastrophizing on pain, suggesting a mutual causation between these factors. The results support that treatments targeting catastrophizing may influence other pain-related outcomes, and conversely that treatments aiming to reduce pain could potentially influence catastrophizing. There may therefore be multiple paths to positive outcomes.

Yet similarities to sleep-related experiences such as hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations, dreams and parasomnias, have been noted since antiquity. These observations have prompted researchers to suggest a common aetiology for these phenomena based on the neurobiology of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. With our recent understanding of hallucinations in different population groups and at the neurobiological, cognitive and interpersonal levels, it is now possible to draw comparisons between the 2 sets of experiences as never before. In the current article, we make detailed comparisons between sleep-related experiences and hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eye disease, at the levels of phenomenology (content, sensory modalities involved, perceptual attributes) and of brain function (brain activations, resting-state networks, neurotransmitter action). Findings show that sleep-related experiences share considerable overlap with hallucinations at the level of subjective descriptions and underlying brain mechanisms. Key differences remain however: (1) Sleep-related perceptions are immersive and largely cut off from reality, whereas hallucinations are discrete and overlaid on veridical perceptions; and (2) Sleep-related perceptions involve only a subset of neural networks implicated in hallucinations, reflecting perceptual signals processed in a functionally and cognitively closed-loop circuit. In summary, both phenomena are non-veridical perceptions that share some phenomenological and neural similarities, but insufficient evidence exists to fully support the notion that the majority of hallucinations depend on REM processes or REM intrusions into waking consciousness.

Syndromic early-onset scoliosis is considered one of the most aggressive types of early-onset scoliosis. Treatment starts with serial casting and bracing, but eventually most of these patients undergo growth-sparing procedures, such as a single growing rod, dual growing rods, or a vertical expandable titanium prosthetic rib. PURPOSE: This case report aimed to describe an unusual complication of erosion of a growing rod through the lamina that caused spinal cord compression in an 8-year-old girl with early-onset scoliosis. STUDY DESIGN: This is a case report. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was used to describe the clinical course and radiographic findings of this case after rod erosion into the spinal canal. RESULTS: The patient underwent successful revision surgery removing the rod without neurologic complications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with syndromic early-onset scoliosis are more prone to progressive curves and severe rotational deformity. We believe that the severe kyphotic deformity in addition to the dysplastic nature of the deformity in this population may predispose them to this unusual complication. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

SLC25A46 is required for mitochondrial lipid homeostasis and cristae maintenance and is responsible for Leigh syndrome	EMBO MOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Leigh syndrome; mitochondrial architecture; phospholipid transfer; SLC25A46	CYTOCHROME-C-OXIDASE; DOMINANT OPTIC ATROPHY; DYNAMIN-RELATED GTPASE; MEMBRANE PROTEIN UGO1; OUTER-MEMBRANE; CONTACT SITE; CELLULAR SENESCENCE; ORGANIZING SYSTEM; CARRIER PROTEIN; FUSION	Mitochondria form a dynamic network that responds to physiological signals and metabolic stresses by altering the balance between fusion and fission. Mitochondrial fusion is orchestrated by conserved GTPases MFN1/2 and OPA1, a process coordinated in yeast by Ugo1, a mitochondrial metabolite carrier family protein. We uncovered a homozygous missense mutation in SLC25A46, the mammalian orthologue of Ugo1, in a subject with Leigh syndrome. SLC25A46 is an integral outer membrane protein that interacts with MFN2, OPA1, and the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex. The subject mutation destabilizes the protein, leading to mitochondrial hyperfusion, alterations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology, impaired cellular respiration, and premature cellular senescence. The MICOS complex is disrupted in subject fibroblasts, resulting in strikingly abnormal mitochondrial architecture, with markedly shortened cristae. SLC25A46 also interacts with the ER membrane protein complex EMC, and phospholipid composition is altered in subject mitochondria. These results show that SLC25A46 plays a role in a mitochondrial/ER pathway that facilitates lipid transfer, and link altered mitochondrial dynamics to early-onset neurodegenerative disease and cell fate decisions.

The novel architecture of this MEA has made it unique among the currently available micromachined electrode arrays, as it has provided higher density contacts between the electrodes and targeted neural tissue facilitating recording from different depths of the brain. Our novel masking technique enhances uniform tip-exposure for variable-height electrodes and improves process time and cost significantly. The tips of the electrodes have been coated with platinum (Pt). We have reported for the first time a selective direct growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the tips of 3D MEAs using the Pt coating as a catalyzer. The average impedance of the CNT-coated electrodes at 1 kHz is 14 k. The CNT coating led to a 5-fold decrease of the impedance and a 600-fold increase in charge transfer compared with the Pt electrode.

MethodsSubjects were participants from 3 sites (Columbia University, Rush University, and the University of Pennsylvania) in the Consortium on Risk for Early Onset Parkinson's Disease (CORE-PD) who had an age at onset < 51 years. The analyses presented here focus on glucocerebrosidase (GBA), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), and parkin (PRKN) mutation carriers. Mutation carrier status, demographic data, and disease characteristics in individuals who did and did not enroll in DBS were analyzed. The association between mutation status and DBS placement was assessed in logistic regression models. ResultsPatients who had PD with either GBA, LRRK2, or PRKN mutations were more common in the DBS group (n = 99) compared with the non-DBS group (n = 684; 26.5% vs. 16.8%, respectively; P = 0.02). In a multivariate logistic regression model, GBA mutation status (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-4.3; P = 0.05) was associated with DBS surgery enrollment. However, when dyskinesia was included in the multivariate logistic regression model, dyskinesia had a strong association with DBS placement (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-7.3; P < 0.0001), whereas the association between GBA mutation status and DBS placement did not persist (P = 0.25). ConclusionsDBS populations are enriched with genetic mutation carriers. The effect of genetic mutation carriers on DBS outcomes warrants further exploration.

DR begins with an early nonproliferative stage in which retinal blood vessels and neurons degenerate as a consequence of chronic hyperglycemia, resulting in vasoregression and persistent retinal ischemia, metabolic disequilibrium, and inflammation. This is conducive to overcompensatory pathological neovascularization associated with advanced proliferative DR. Although DR is considered a microvascular complication, the retinal microvasculature is intimately associated with and governed by neurons and glia; neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and dysregulation of neurovascular cross talk are responsible in part for vascular abnormalities in both early nonproliferative DR and advanced proliferative DR. Neuronal activity directly regulates microvascular dilation and blood flow in the process of neurovascular coupling. Retinal neurons also secrete guidance cues in response to injury, ischemia, or metabolic stress that may either promote or suppress vascular outgrowth, either alleviating or exacerbating DR, contingent on the stage of disease and retinal microenvironment. Neurodegeneration, impaired neurovascular coupling, and dysregulation of neuronal guidance cues are key events in the pathogenesis of DR, and correcting these events may prevent or delay development of advanced DR. The review discusses the mechanisms of neurovascular cross talk and its dysregulation in DR, and their potential therapeutic implications.

J	Pakzad, M; Fung, J; Preuss, R				Pakzad, Mohamad; Fung, Joyce; Preuss, Richard			Pain catastrophizing and trunk muscle activation during walking in patients with chronic low back pain	GAIT & POSTURE			English	Article						Chronic low back pain; Gait; Muscle activity; Psychological factors; Guarding strategy	CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; FEAR-AVOIDANCE; GAIT; COORDINATION; DISABILITY; PATTERNS; BELIEFS; SCALE; EMG	It has been hypothesized that individuals with low back pain (LBP) will have higher trunk muscle activity during gait, in an attempt to limit spine motion, and that this "guarding strategy" may be influenced by the person's psychological response to pain. This study investigated whether the amplitude of trunk muscle activation differs between persons with chronic LBP and healthy individuals during walking, and whether changes in muscle activation were related to pain catastrophizing. Thirty persons with chronic non-specific LBP, stratified into 2 groups of high (HLBP) and low (LLBP) pain catastrophizing, were contrasted with a control group of 15 healthy individuals during walking on a treadmill at a self-selected speed. Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were recorded from 10 trunk muscles. The effects of Group and gait Sub-phase on EMG activation amplitudes were assessed. The HLBP group exhibited higher activation of certain muscles throughout the gait cycle, and reduced variability of others at specific sub phases of gait. A significant correlation was found between activation amplitude and pain catastrophizing in most muscles, when controlling for gait speed and pain intensity. These data indicate that altered trunk muscle activation is present in some patients with LBP during walking, but does not represent a universal increase in activation for all muscles. This altered neuromotor control is, however, more strongly associated with pain catastrophizing than with pain intensity, and appears to represent a non-functional, maladaptive behavior, as it alters the normal, phasic pattern of activation in certain trunk muscles.

The objective was to compare lower extremity and trunk muscle activation and joint mechanics between normal and increased LTL gait in healthy adults. Participants (n = 20, mean age 22 years) were examined under two gait conditions: normal and increased LTL. A motion capture system and force plates sampled at 100 and 2000 Hz respectively were used to determine joint angles and external moments including LTL angle and external knee adduction moment (KAM). Surface electromyography, sampled at 2000 Hz, measured activation of six trunk/hip muscles bilaterally. Peak LTL angle, peak KAM, gait speed, and mean values from electromyography waveforms were compared between normal and LTL conditions using paired t-tests or 2-way analysis of variance. There was, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in peak LTL angle, decrease in first but not second peak KAM, and decrease in gait speed during LTL gait. There were significant (p < 0.01) increases in external oblique and iliocostalis muscle activation during LTL gait. There was no change in activation for internal oblique, rectus abdominis, longissimus, and gluteus medius. LTL gait decreased early/mid-stance KAM demonstrating its ability to decrease medial compartment knee loading. Increases in external oblique and iliocostalis activation were present but small to moderate in size and unlikely to lead to short term injury. Longitudinal studies should evaluate the effectiveness of increased LTL for knee osteoarthritis and if the increase in muscular demands leads to negative long term side effects.

The orphan pentameric ligand-gated ion channel pHCl-2 is gated by pH and regulates fluid secretion in Drosophila Malpighian tubules	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						pLGIC; Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel; Renal; Diuresis	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; MOSQUITO AEDES-AEGYPTI; CHLORIDE CHANNEL; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; STELLATE CELLS; H+-ATPASE; V-ATPASE; GENE SUPERFAMILY; DIURETIC PEPTIDE; C-ELEGANS	Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) constitute a large protein superfamily in metazoa whose role as neurotransmitter receptors mediating rapid, ionotropic synaptic transmission has been extensively studied. Although the vast majority of pLGICs appear to be neurotransmitter receptors, the identification of pLGICs in non-neuronal tissues and homologous pLGIC-like proteins in prokaryotes points to biological functions, possibly ancestral, that are independent of neuronal signalling. Here, we report the molecular and physiological characterization of a highly divergent, orphan pLGIC subunit encoded by the pHCl-2 (CG11340) gene, in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that pHCl-2 forms a channel that is insensitive to a wide array of neurotransmitters, but is instead gated by changes in extracellular pH. pHCl-2 is expressed in the Malpighian tubules, which are non-innervated renal-type secretory tissues. We demonstrate that pHCl-2 is localized to the apical membrane of the epithelial principal cells of the tubules and that loss of pHCl-2 reduces urine production during diuresis. Our data implicate pHCl-2 as an important source of chloride conductance required for proper urine production, highlighting a novel role for pLGICs in epithelial tissues regulating fluid secretion and osmotic homeostasis.

Despite multimodal therapy, it is associated with a survival of less than two years. Greater than 85% of recurrences occur within the original area of surgery and radiotherapy, suggesting a potential for improved local treatments. In addition to cancer cell invasion beyond surgical margins, a plethora of postinjury pro-proliferative stimuli are released from local healing brain, which both protect and nourish remaining cancer cells. This review compiles preclinical and clinical evidence for a dedicated treatment of both residual cancer cells and regional microenvironment using intraoperative radiotherapy (TORT).

Its unique capacity to integrate various Ca2+ signals into different specific outcomes is a precious asset to excitable and nonexcitable cells. Numerous studies have reported roles and mechanisms involving CaMKII in brain and heart tissues. However, corresponding functions in vascular cell types (endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells) remained largely unexplored until recently. Investigation of the intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, their impact on vascular cell function, the regulatory processes involved and more recently the spatially restricted oscillatory Ca2+ signals and microdomains triggered significant interest towards proteins like CaMKII. Heteromultimerization of CaMKII isoforms (four isoforms and several splice variants) expands this kinase's peculiar capacity to decipher Ca2+ signals and initiate specific signaling processes, and thus controlling cellular functions. The physiological functions that rely on CaMKII are unsurprisingly diverse, ranging from regulating contractile state and cellular proliferation to Ca2+ homeostasis and cellular permeability. This review will focus on emerging evidence of CaMKII as an essential component of the vascular system, with a focus on the kinase isoform/splice variants and cellular system studied.

Even though its reliance on hippocampal networks has long been established, the precise computations performed by different hippocampal subfields during spatial learning are still not clear. To study the evolution of electrophysiological activity in the CA1-dentate gyrus axis of the dorsal hippocampus over an iterative spatial learning paradigm, we recorded local field potentials in behaving mice using a newly designed appetitive version of the Barnes maze. We first showed that theta and gamma oscillations as well as theta-gamma coupling are differentially modulated in particular hippocampal subfields during the task. In addition, we show that dentate gyrus networks, but not CA1 networks, exhibit a transient learning-dependent increase in theta-gamma coupling specifically at the vicinity of the target area in the maze. In contrast to previous immediate early-gene studies, our results point to a long-lasting involvement of dentate networks in navigational memory in the Barnes maze. Based on these findings, we propose that theta-gamma coupling might represent a mechanism by which hippocampal areas compute relevant information.

Yet, it is not clear whether consolidation and memory modification are the same or different systems-level processes. Here, we report disrupted memory modification in the presence of normal consolidation of human motor memories, which relate to differences in lesioned brain structure after stroke. Furthermore, this behavioral dissociation was associated with macrostructural network architecture revealed by a graph-theoretical approach, and with white-matter microstructural integrity measured by diffusion-weighted MRI. Altered macrostructural network architecture and microstructural integrity of white-matter underlying critical nodes of the related network predicted disrupted memory modification. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first evidence of mechanistic differences between consolidation, and subsequent memory modification through reconsolidation, in human procedural learning. These findings enable better understanding of these memory processes, which may guide interventional strategies to enhance brain function and resulting behavior.

The developed scheme is applied to the piezoelectric positioning stage, showing the advantages of the proposed approach by the experimental results. The main contributions are: 1) by using the neural networks as an approximator, the nonlinear function in the systems can be completely unknown; 2) by designing a high-gain observer to estimate the states of the system and cope with the uncertainties of the system, only the output of the control system is required measurable; 3) experiments on the piezoelectric positioning stage were conducted where the piezoelectric positioning stage is considered as a third-order system under the condition only the output of the system is available; 4) by adjusting the initial conditions of the states observer and adaptive laws of unknown parameters, the arbitrarily small L-infinity norm of the tracking error is deviated. It is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop systems are semiglobally ultimately uniformly bounded.

One view of this dissociation is that the anterior and posterior hippocampus support gist-based/conceptual and fine-grained/spatial memory representations, respectively. It is not clear if such distinctions hold for other cognitive domains. To test this possibility, we examined anterior and posterior hippocampal contributions to a standard semantic retrieval task, category fluency. During fMRI scanning, participants generated exemplars to categories that were based on conceptual (autobiographical categories - 'movies that you have seen') or spatio-perceptual (spatial categories - 'items in a kitchen') information. Our main finding was that the autobiographical categories preferentially recruited the anterior hippocampus whereas the spatial categories preferentially recruited the posterior hippocampus. Differences were also evident when we examined the patterns of task-based hippocampal connectivity associated with these two forms of fluency. Our findings provide evidence for a functional organization along the long axis of the hippocampus that is based on conceptual and perceptual relational retrieval and indicate that this manner of organization is apparent outside the domain of episodic memory.

SYMPATHOADRENAL ACTIVATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE TRAUMATIC COAGULOPATHY AND ENDOTHELIOPATHY IN ISOLATED BRAIN INJURY	SHOCK			English	Article						Catecholamines; D-dimer; hemostasis; norepinephrine; syndecan-1; thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; thrombomodulin; tissue factor pathway inhibitor; tissue plasminogen activator; vascular adhesion protein-1	DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION; PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME; HEAD-INJURY; GLYCOCALYX DEGRADATION; HYPERCOAGULABLE STATE; PROTHROMBIN TIME; SEVERE SEPSIS; IN-VIVO; DAMAGE; INFLAMMATION	Background: Acute coagulopathy after traumatic brain injury (TBI) involves a complex multifactorial hemostatic response that is poorly characterized. Objectives: To examine early posttraumatic alterations in coagulofibrinolytic, endothelial, and inflammatory blood biomarkers in relation to sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation and 6-month patient outcomes, using multivariate partial least-squares (PLS) analysis. Patients and Methods: A multicenter observational study of 159 adult isolated TBI patients admitted to the emergency department at an urban level I trauma center, was performed. Plasma concentrations of 6 coagulofibrinolytic, 10 vascular endothelial, 19 inflammatory, and 2 catecholamine biomarkers were measured by immunoassay on admission and 24 h postinjury. Neurological outcome at 6 months was assessed using the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale. PLS-discriminant analysis was used to identify salient biomarker contributions to unfavorable outcome, whereas PLS regression analysis was used to evaluate the covariance between SNS correlates (catecholamines) and biomarkers of coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, and inflammation. Results: Biomarker profiles in patients with an unfavorable outcome displayed procoagulation, hyperfibrinolysis, glycocalyx and endothelial damage, vasculature activation, and inflammation. A strong covariant relationship was evident between catecholamines and biomarkers of coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, and inflammation at both admission and 24 h postinjury. Conclusions: Biomarkers of coagulopathy and endotheliopathy are associated with poor outcome after TBI. Catecholamine levels were highly correlated with endotheliopathy and coagulopathy markers within the first 24 h after injury. Further research is warranted to characterize the pathogenic role of SNS-mediated hemostatic alterations in isolated TBI.

Interplay of brain structure and function in neonatal congenital heart disease	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							WHITE-MATTER MICROSTRUCTURE; GREAT-ARTERIES; D-TRANSPOSITION; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; CIRCULATORY ARREST; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; PRETERM INFANTS; INJURY; EEG; NEWBORNS	ObjectiveTo evaluate whether structural and microstructural brain abnormalities in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) correlate with neuronal network dysfunction measured by analysis of EEG connectivity. MethodsWe studied a prospective cohort of 20 neonates with CHD who underwent continuous EEG monitoring before surgery to assess functional brain maturation and network connectivity, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the presence of brain injury and structural brain development, and diffusion tensor MRI to assess brain microstructural development. ResultsNeonates with MRI brain injury and delayed structural and microstructural brain development demonstrated significantly stronger high-frequency (beta and gamma frequency band) connectivity. Furthermore, neonates with delayed microstructural brain development demonstrated significantly weaker low-frequency (delta, theta, alpha frequency band) connectivity. Neonates with brain injury also displayed delayed functional maturation of EEG background activity, characterized by greater background discontinuity. InterpretationThese data provide new evidence that early structural and microstructural developmental brain abnormalities can have immediate functional consequences that manifest as characteristic alterations of neuronal network connectivity. Such early perturbations of developing neuronal networks, if sustained, may be responsible for the persistent neurocognitive impairment prevalent in adolescent survivors of CHD. These foundational insights into the complex interplay between evolving brain structure and function may have relevance for a wide spectrum of neurological disorders manifesting early developmental brain injury.

The proportion of physiological and pathological HFOs is unclear, as frequency analysis is insufficient for separating the two types of events. For instance, ripples (80-250 Hz) also occur physiologically during memory consolidation processes in medial temporal lobe structures. We investigated the correlation between HFO rates and memory performance. Methods: Patients investigated with bilateral medial temporal electrodes and an intellectual capacity allowing for memory testing were included. High-frequency oscillations were visually marked, and rates of HFOs were calculated for each channel during slow-wave sleep. Patients underwent three verbal and three nonverbal memory tests. They were grouped into severe impairment, some impairment, mostly intact, or intact for verbal and nonverbal memory. We calculated a Pearson correlation between HFO rates in the hippocampi and the memory category and compared HFO rates in each hippocampus with the corresponding (verbal - left, nonverbal - right) memory result using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: Twenty patients were included; ten had bilateral, five had unilateral, and five had no memory impairment. Unilateral memory impairment was verbal in one patient and nonverbal in four. There was no correlation between HFO rates and memory performance in seizure onset areas. There was, however, a significant negative correlation between the overall memory performance and ripple rates (r = -0.50, p = 0.03) outside the seizure onset zone. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the majority of spontaneous hippocampal ripples, as defined in the present study, may reflect pathological activity, taking into account the association with memory impairment. The absence of negative correlation between memory performance and HFO rates in seizure onset areas could be explained by HFO rates in the SOZ being generally so high that differences between areas with remaining and impaired memory function cannot be seen.

Ultrasound is a popular imaging modality for providing the neurosurgeon with real-time updated images of brain tissue. Interpretation of postresection ultrasound images is difficult due to large brain shift and tissue resection. Furthermore, several factors degrade the quality of postresection ultrasound images such as the strong reflection of waves at the interface of saline water and brain tissue in resection cavities, air bubbles, and the application of blood-clotting agents around the edges of resection. Image registration allows the comparison of postresection ultrasound images with higher quality preresection images, assists in interpretation of postresection images and may help identify residual tumor, and, as such, is of significant clinical importance. In this paper, we propose a nonrigid symmetric registration (NSR) framework for accurate alignment of pre- and postresection volumetric ultrasound images in near real time. We first formulate registration as minimization of a regularized cost function and analytically derive its derivative to efficiently optimize the cost function. An outlier detection algorithm is proposed and utilized in this framework to identify noncorresponding regions (outliers) and therefore improve the robustness and accuracy of registration. We use an efficient secondorder minimization method for fast and robust optimization. Furthermore, we exploit a symmetric and inverse-consistent method to generate realistic deformation fields. The results show that NSR significantly improves the quality of the alignment between pre- and postresection ultrasound images.

Accumulated empirical findings show that the gain modulation and reflex gating are secondary, emergent properties of central control of spatial thresholds at which reflexes become functional. In this way, the system pre-determines, in a feedforward and task-specific way, where, in a spatial domain or a frame of reference, muscles are allowed to work without directly prescribing EMG activity and forces. This control strategy is illustrated by considering reflex adaptation to repeated muscle stretches in healthy subjects, a process associated with implicit learning and generalization. It has also been shown that spasticity, rigidity, weakness and other neurological motor deficits may have a common source-limitations in the range of spatial threshold control elicited by neural lesions.

Whether these same cues provoke DA release in the human prefrontal cortex remains unknown. Methods We used high-resolution positron emission tomography with [F-18]fallypride to measure cortical and striatal DA D2/3 receptor availability in the presence versus absence of drug-related cues in volunteers with current cocaine dependence. Results Twelve individuals participated in our study. Among participants reporting a craving response (9 of 12), exposure to the cocaine cues significantly decreased [F-18]fallypride binding potential (BPND) values in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and striatum. In all 12 participants, individual differences in the magnitude of craving correlated with BPND changes in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and striatum. Consistent with the presence of autoreceptors on mesostriatal but not mesocortical DA cell bodies, midbrain BPND values were significantly correlated with changes in BPND within the striatum but not the cortex. The lower the midbrain D2 receptor levels, the greater the striatal change in BPND and self-reported craving. Limitations Limitations of this study include its modest sample size, with only 2 female participants. Newer tracers might have greater sensitivity to cortical DA release. Conclusion In people with cocaine use disorders, the presentation of drug-related cues induces DA release within cortical and striatal regions. Both effects are associated with craving, but only the latter is regulated by midbrain autoreceptors. Together, the results suggest that cortical and subcortical DA responses might both influence drug-focused incentive motivational states, but with separate regulatory mechanisms.

Since the emergence of molecular biology and the discovery of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA defects in the 1980's, research advances have revealed a number of common human diseases which share an underlying pathogenesis involving mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria undergo function-defining dynamic shape changes, communicate with each other, regulate gene expression within the nucleus, modulate synaptic transmission within the brain, release molecules that contribute to oncogenic transformation and trigger inflammatory responses systemically, and influence the regulation of complex physiological systems. Novel mitopathogenic mechanisms are thus being uncovered across a number of medical disciplines including genetics, oncology, neurology, immunology, and critical care medicine. Increasing knowledge of the bioenergetic aspects of human disease has provided new opportunities for diagnosis, therapy, prevention, and in connecting various domains of medicine.

Objective: To investigate cerebellar growth longitudinally in pediatric ADS. Methods: Cerebellar volumes from 472 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 98 patients with monophasic ADS (monoADS), monophasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and MS (49 girls; mean age: 11.4years at first scan, mean follow-up: 3.1years) imaged serially from onset and 897 MRI scans of 418 healthy children (223 girls, mean age: 11.3years, mean follow-up: 2.9years) were segmented automatically, analyzed with mixed-effect models, and compared with cerebral volume. Results: Cerebellar developmental trajectories followed a U-shaped curve, showing larger volumes in boys (p<0.001). Cerebellar volumes in all three patient groups failed to reach age-expected trajectories, leading to significantly smaller volumes, notably in the posterior lobes. Cerebellar volume reductions were of a similar magnitude to cerebral volume reductions. Cerebellar white matter volume declined in MS and ADEM patients over time, while in monoADS patients it remained similar to controls. Cerebellar volumes did not correlate either with lesion volumes at onset or with physical disability. Conclusion: MonoADS, ADEM, and MS in childhood lead to impaired age-expected growth of the cerebellum.	[Weier, Katrin; Fonov, Vladimir; Aubert-Broche, Berengere; Arnold, Douglas L.; Collins, D.

Variation in Social Relationships Relates to Song Preferences and EGR1 Expression in a Female Songbird	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						EGR1; zebra finch; pair-bonding; preference; auditory	FINCHES TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA; ZEBRA FINCHES; AUDITORY FOREBRAIN; DOPAMINE NEURONS; GENE-EXPRESSION; PRAIRIE VOLE; MATE CHOICE; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; RESPONSES	Social experiences can profoundly shape social behavior and the underlying neural circuits. Across species, the formation of enduring social relationships is associated with both neural and behavioral changes. However, it remains unclear how longer-term relationships between individuals influence brain and behavior. Here, we investigated how variation in social relationships relates to variation in female preferences for and neural responses to song in a pair-bonding songbird. We assessed variation in the interactions between individuals in male-female zebra finch pairs and found that female preferences for their mate's song were correlated with the degree of affiliation and amount of socially modulated singing, but not with the frequency of aggressive interactions. Moreover, variation in measures of pair quality and preference correlated with variation in the song-induced expression of EGR1, an immediate early gene related to neural activity and plasticity, in brain regions important for auditory processing and social behavior. For example, females with weaker preferences for their mate's song had greater EGR1 expression in the nucleus Taeniae, the avian homologue of the mammalian medial amygdala, in response to playback of their mate's courtship song. Our data indicate that the quality of social interactions within pairs relates to variation in song preferences and neural responses to ethologically relevant stimuli and lend insight into neural circuits sensitive to social information.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to systematically evaluate the effects of anodal tDCS on corticospinal excitability at two stimulation intensities (1mA, 2mA) and durations (10min, 20min), and determine the value of several variables in predicting response. Two groups of 20 individuals received, in two separate sessions, 1 and 2mA anodal tDCS (left primary motor cortex (M1)-right supra-orbital montage) for either 10- or 20-min. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was delivered over left M1 and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) of the contralateral hand were recorded prior to tDCS and every 5min for 20-min post-tDCS. The following predictive variables were evaluated: I-wave recruitment, stimulation intensity, baseline M1 excitability and inter-trial MEP variability. Results show that anodal tDCS failed to significantly modulate corticospinal excitability in all conditions. Furthermore, low response rates were identified across all parameter combinations. No baseline measure was significantly correlated with increases in MEP amplitude. However, a decrease in inter-trial MEP variability was linked to response to anodal tDCS. In conclusion, the present findings are consistent with recent reports showing high levels of inter-subject variability in the neurophysiological response to tDCS, which may partly explain inconsistent group results. Furthermore, the level of variability in the neurophysiological outcome measure, i.e. MEPs, appears to be related to response.

Recent small-scale clinical studies suggested anti-depressant treatment using deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum or subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC), yet controlled, multi-center trials were unsuccessful. We recently suggested the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as an important intersection for treating depression. We also found that stimulation of the VTA of a genetic rat model of depression (Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats) with a programmed pattern designed to mimic the burst firing of normal rats decreases depressive-like behavior. Herein, we examined the possibility of reaching the VTA - located deep in the brain stem - through its direct connection to the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which parallels the human SCC. Thus, we compared treatment of FSLs with modified versions of DBS - either chronic-intermittent low-frequency electrical stimulation of the vmPFC, or patterned acute electrical stimulation (pAES), which integrates transcranial magnetic stimulation properties, namely, bursts of pulse trains and low frequency stimulation, applied to the VTA. We found that stimulation of the vmPFC (20 Hz, 15 min/day, 10 days) improved depressive like behavior and VTA local field potential (LFP) activity of FSLs, yet it had only a partial long-term effect on behavior. In particular, vmPFC stimulation decreased theta band activity, which correlated with the improvement in depressive-like behavior of all treated FSLs at day 1, and in similar to 50% of treated FSLs at day 28 post treatment. pAES of the VTA (10 Hz, 20 min) caused significant, long-term improvement of depressive-like behavior of FSLs, concurrently with normalizing intra-VTA LFP activity, and increasing VTA LFP synchronicity and hippocampal BDNF mRNA levels. Thus, although low-frequency electrical stimulation of the PFC alters VTA activity, leading to attenuation of depressive-like manifestations, a specific stimulation pattern affecting VTA cell programming is important for long-term efficacy.

Using a cross-splicing paradigm, we investigated how conflicting cues about a speaker's feeling of (un)knowing change one's perception. Listeners rated the confidence of speakers of utterances containing an initial verbal phrase congruent or incongruent with vocal cues in a subsequent statement, while their brain potentials were tracked. Different forms of conflicts modulated the perceived confidence of the speaker, the extent to which was stronger for female listeners. A confident phrase followed by an unconfident voice enlarged an anteriorly maximized negativity for female listeners and late positivity for male listeners, suggesting that mental representations of another's feeling of knowing in face of this conflict were hampered by increased demands of integration for females and increased demands on updating for males. An unconfident phrase followed by a confident voice elicited a delayed sustained positivity (from 900 ms) in female participants only, suggesting females generated inferences to moderate the conflicting message about speaker knowledge. We highlight ways that verbal and vocal cues are real-time integrated to access a speaker's feeling of (un) knowing, while arguing that females are more sensitive to the social relevance of conflicting speaker cues.

The Beneficial Influence of Inattention on Visual Interference in Schizophrenia	NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; visual interference; divided attention; event-related potentials; local/global perception	PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION DEFICITS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; STROOP TASK; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; CONTEXT; DISSOCIATION; MECHANISMS	Objective: Schizophrenia is associated with poor spatial attention. However, although this deficit undermines the perception of target information, it may be helpful for ignoring irrelevant inputs. The present study examined whether event-related brain potential (ERP) indices of visual spatial attention predicted the magnitude of the brain response to interference in schizophrenia. Method: ERPs were recorded in 16 schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy control participants who had to indicate whether the target E was global or local in compound letter stimuli. The nontarget could be either highly similar to the target (i.e., a global E composed of local Ss and vice versa) and thus produce more interference, or it could be dissimilar (i.e., a global E composed of local Hs and vice versa) and generate less interference. Results: Both groups' responses were slowed by interference. Voltage amplitudes of the P1, and of ERP interference effects from 300-500 ms after stimulus onset, were significantly smaller in schizophrenia patients than in healthy participants when the target was global. In patients, larger P1 amplitudes were correlated with larger interference effects and with more severe symptoms of attentional deficits and conceptual disorganization. Schizophrenia participants thus exhibited abnormal ERPs to interference despite normal behavioral performance. Conclusions: Schizophrenia patients likely pay less attention to stimuli in general; however, the impact of this impairment on target detection is compensated by relatively greater inattention to irrelevant components of the stimuli, and this explains why they are not more influenced by interference than healthy participants at the behavioral level.

Determinants of urinary concentrations of dialkyl phosphates among pregnant women in Canada - Results from the MIREC study	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Biomonitoring; Dialkyl phosphates; Organophosphate pesticide; Pregnancy	ORGANOPHOSPHATE PESTICIDE METABOLITES; NEW-YORK-CITY; DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROTOXICITY; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; GESTATIONAL-AGE; DERMAL CONTACT; AMNIOTIC-FLUID; FETAL-GROWTH; GENERATION R; CHLORPYRIFOS	Organophosphate (OP) insecticides are commonly used in agriculture. Their use decreased in recent years as they were gradually replaced by other pesticides, but some OPs are still among the insecticides most used in Canada. Exposure to elevated levels of OPs during pregnancy has been associated with adverse birth outcomes and poorer neurodevelopment in children. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between the concentrations of OP pesticides urinary dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites and various factors that are potential sources of exposure or determinants of DAP levels. In the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, six DAPS were measured in 1st trimester urine samples of 1884 pregnant women living in Canada. They were grouped into sums of dimethyl alkyl phosphates (DMAP) and diethyl alkyl phosphates (DEAP) for statistical analysis. We found that 93% of women had at least one DAP detected in their urine. Geometric means (GM) of specific gravity-corrected levels for urine dilution were 59 (95% CI 56-62) and 21 (95% CI 20-22) nmol/L for DMAP and DEAP, respectively. The following characteristics were significantly associated with higher urinary concentrations of DMAP or DEAP: higher education, nulliparous, normal pre-pregnancy body mass index, non-smoker, not fasting at sampling, winter season at sampling, and early and late day collection times. Dietary items that were significantly related with higher urinary concentrations included higher intake of citrus fruits, apple juice, sweet peppers, tomatoes, beans and dry peas, soy and rice beverages, whole grain bread, white wine and green and herbal teas. This study indicates that exposure to these compounds is quasi ubiquitous. The factors associated with greater DAP levels identified here could be useful to regulatory agencies for risk analysis and management.

Inborn errors of Cbl metabolism are rare Mendelian disorders associated with hematological and neurological manifestations, and elevations of methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine in the blood and urine. We describe a patient whose fibroblasts had decreased functional activity of MCM and MS and decreased synthesis of AdoCbl and MeCbl (3.4% and 1.0% of cellular Cbl, respectively). The defect in cultured patient fibroblasts complemented those from all known complementation groups. Patient cells accumulated transcobalamin-bound-Cbl, a complex which usually dissociates in the lysosome to release free Cbl. Whole-exome sequencing identified putative disease-causing variants c.851T>G (p.L284*) and c.1019C>T (p.T340I) in transcription factor ZNF143. Proximity biotinylation analysis confirmed the interaction between ZNF143 and HCFC1, a protein that regulates expression of the Cbl trafficking enzyme MMACHC. qRT-PCR analysis revealed low MMACHC expression levels both in patient fibroblasts, and in control fibroblasts incubated with ZNF143 siRNA.

Deep shape-aware descriptor for nonrigid 3D object retrieval	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIMEDIA INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						3D shape retrieval; Deep learning; Spectral graph wavelets; Locality-constrained linear coding; Biharmonic distance; Bag-of-features	SIGNATURE; SURFACES	Deep learning is a rapidly growing discipline that models high-level features in data as multilayered neural networks. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for 3D shape retrieval using a multi-level feature learning methodology. We first extract low-level features or local descriptors from a 3D shape using spectral graph wavelets. Then, we construct mid-level features from these local descriptors via the bag-of-features paradigm by employing locality-constrained linear coding as a feature coding method, together with the biharmonic distance as a measure of the spatial relationship between each pair of bag-of-feature descriptors. Finally, high-level shape features are learned via a deep auto-encoder, resulting in a deep shape-aware descriptor that is compact, geometrically informative and efficient to compute. The proposed 3D shape retrieval approach is evaluated on SHREC-2014 and SHREC-2015 datasets through extensive experiments, and the results show compelling superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.

Classification of Rockburst in Underground Projects: Comparison of Ten Supervised Learning Methods	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Underground project; Rockburst; Supervised learning; Classification; Cross-validation; Nonparametric statistical test	ROCK MASS; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; ENERGY-RELEASE; PREDICTION; MACHINE; MODELS; INDEX; STABILITY; AGREEMENT; FAILURE	Rockburst prediction is of crucial importance to the design and construction of many underground projects. Insufficient knowledge, lack of characterizing information, and noisy data restrain rock mechanics engineers from achieving optimal prediction results. In this paper, a data set of 246 rockburst events was examined for rockburst classification using supervised learning (SL) methods. The data set was analyzed with 8 potentially relevant indicators. Eleven algorithms from 10 categories of SL algorithms were evaluated for their ability to learn rockburst, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), naive Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), classification tree (CT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient-boosting machine (GBM). The data set was randomly split into two parts: training (70%) and test (30%). A 10-fold cross-validation (CV) method was applied during modeling, and an external testing set was employed to validate the prediction performance of the SL models. Two accuracy measures for multiclass problems were employed: classification rate and Cohen's Kappa. The accuracy analysis, together with Cohen's kappa and a nonparametric statistical test for the rockburst data set, revealed that the best models for the prediction of rockburst were GBM and RF when compared with other learning algorithms.

Researchers have proposed active leakage control approaches to localize, locate, and pinpoint leaks. Noise loggers have usually been used only for localizing leaks while other tools were used for locating and pinpointing. These approaches have resulted in additional cost and time. Thus, regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed in this study to localize and locate leaks in water pipelines using noise loggers. Several lab experiments have been conducted to simulate actual leaks in a sample ductile iron pipeline distribution network with valves. The noise loggers were used to detect these leaks and record their noise readings. The recorded noise readings were then used as input data for the developed models. The ANN models outperformed regression models during testing. Moreover, ANN models were successfully validated using an actual case study.

The association between subcortical and cortical structural alterations, and glutamatergic neurometabolites is of particular interest due to glutamate's capacity for neurotoxicity; elevated levels may be related to neuroanatomical compromise through an excitotoxic process. To this end, we explored the relationships between glutamatergic neurometabolites and structural measures in antipsychotic-naive patients experiencing their first non-affective episode of psychosis (FEP). Sixty antipsychoticnaive patients with FEP and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent a magnetic resonance imaging session, which included a T1-weighted volumetric image and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the precommissural dorsal caudate. Group differences in precommissural caudate volume (PCV) and cortical thickness (CT), and the relationships between glutamatergic neurometabolites (ie, glutamate+glutamine (Glx) and glutamate) and these structural measures, were examined. PCV was decreased in the FEP group (p<0.001), yet did not differ when controlling for total brain volume. Cortical thinning existed in the FEP group within frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and limbic regions at a 5% false discovery rate. Glx levels were negatively associated with PCV only in the FEP group (p = 0.018). The observed relationship between Glx and PCV in the FEP group is supportive of a focal excitotoxic mechanism whereby increased levels of glutamatergic markers are related to local structural losses. This process may be related to the prominent structural deficits that exist in patients with schizophrenia.

It is characterized by a highly proliferative population of cells that invade surrounding tissue and that frequently recur after surgical resection and chemotherapy. Over the last decades, a number of promising novel pharmacological approaches have been investigated, but most of them have failed clinical trials due to some side-effects such as toxicity and poor drug delivery to the brain. The major obstacle in the treatment of GBM is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Due to their relatively high molecular weight, most therapeutic drugs fail to cross the BBB from the blood circulation. Objective: This paper sheds light on the characteristics of GBM and the challenges of current pharmacological treatments. A closer look is given to the role of nanotechnology in the field of drug delivery, and its application in the treatment of brain tumors such as GBM. Method: For this purpose, effort was made to select the most recent studies using predefined search criteria that included at least one of the following keywords in the PubMed and Medline databases: glioblastoma, drug delivery, blood-brain barrier, nanotechnology, and nanoparticle. Conclusion: Breakthrough in nanotechnology offers promising applications in cancer therapy and targeted drug delivery. However, more efforts need to be devoted to the development of novel therapeutic strategies that enable the delivery of drugs to desired areas of the brain with limited side-effects and higher therapeutic efficiency.

For the simultaneous bilinguals, gray matter density was increased in the left putamen, as well as in the left posterior insula, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left and right occipital cortex. For the sequential bilinguals, gray matter density was increased in the bilateral premotor cortex. Sequential bilinguals with better accents also showed greater gray matter density in the left putamen, and in several additional brain regions important for sensorimotor integration and speech-motor control. Our findings suggest that second language learning results in enhanced brain structure of specific brain areas, which depends on whether two languages are learned simultaneously or sequentially, and on the extent to which native-like proficiency is acquired.

Reduced synapse number and quality correlates with loss of memory in dementia. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), the major transcription factor regulating expression of heat shock genes, plays a central role in proteostasis, in establishing and sustaining synaptic fidelity and function, and in memory consolidation. Support for this thesis is based on these observations: (1) heat shock induces improvements in synapse integrity and memory consolidation; (2) synaptic depolarization activates HSF1; (3) activation of HSF1 alone (independent of the canonical heat shock response) augments formation of essential synaptic elements-neuroligands, vesicle transport, synaptic scaffolding proteins, lipid rafts, synaptic spines, and axodendritic synapses; (4) HSF1 coalesces and activates memory receptors in the post-synaptic dendritic spine; (5) huntingtin or alpha-synuclein accumulation lowers HSF1 while HSF1 lowers huntingtin and alpha-synuclein aggregation-a potential vicious cycle; and (6) HSF1 agonists (including physical activity) can improve cognitive function in dementia models. Thus, via direct gene expression of synaptic elements, production of HSPs that assure high protein fidelity, and activation of other neuroprotective signaling pathways, HSF1 agonists could provide breakthrough therapy for dementia-associated disease.

The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis regulates long-term depression and learning rate	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						XIAP; caspase-3; hippocampus; AMPAR; synaptic activity	AMPA RECEPTOR; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NMR STRUCTURE; PROTEIN XIAP; CASPASE-3; LTD; MEMORY; CONSOLIDATION; TRAFFICKING	Hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) is an active form of synaptic plasticity that is necessary for consolidation of spatial memory, contextual fear memory, and novelty acquisition. Recent studies have shown that caspases (CASPs) play an important role in NMDA receptor-dependent LTD and are involved in postsynaptic remodeling and synaptic maturation. In the present study, we examined the role of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), a putative endogenous CASP inhibitor, in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis in acute brain slices and in cultured hippocampal neurons revealed that XIAP deletion increases CASP-3 activity, enhances -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor internalization, sharply increases LTD, and significantly reduces synapse density. In vivo behaviors related to memory were also altered in XIAP(-/-) mice, with faster acquisition of spatial object location and increased fear memory observed. Together, these results indicate that XIAP plays an important physiologic role in regulating sublethal CASP-3 activity within central neurons and thereby facilitates synaptic plasticity and memory acquisition.Gibon, J., Unsain, N., Gamache, K., Thomas, R.

Magnetoencephalographic Signatures of Insular Epileptic Spikes Based on Functional Connectivity	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						brain disorders; epilepsies; partial; brain imaging; cortical phase synchronization; nonparametric statistics	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SEIZURE ONSET ZONE; INTERICTAL ACTIVITY; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; HUMAN CORTEX; EEG; PROPAGATION; BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; DISCHARGES	Failure to recognize insular cortex seizures has recently been identified as a cause of epilepsy surgeries targeting the temporal, parietal, or frontal lobe. Such failures are partly due to the fact that current noninvasive localization techniques fare poorly in recognizing insular epileptic foci. Our group recently demonstrated that magnetoencephalography ( MEG) is sensitive to epileptiform spikes generated by the insula. In this study, we assessed the potential of distributed source imaging and functional connectivity analyses to distinguish insular networks underlying the generation of spikes. Nineteen patients with operculo- insular epilepsy were investigated. Each patient underwent MEG as well as T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) as part of their standard presurgical evaluation. Cortical sources of MEG spikes were reconstructed with the maximum entropy on the mean algorithm, and their time courses served to analyze source functional connectivity. The results indicate that the anterior and posterior subregions of the insula have specific patterns of functional connectivity mainly involving frontal and parietal regions, respectively. In addition, while their connectivity patterns are qualitatively similar during rest and during spikes, couplings within these networks are much stronger during spikes. These results show that MEG can establish functional connectivity-based signatures that could help in the diagnosis of different subtypes of insular cortex epilepsy. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Unfortunately, with regard to retinoblastoma, this barrier also prevents systemically administered therapeutics reaching the retinal tissue. In this study we introduce a novel technique to locally and transiently increase BRB permeability for drug delivery using hyperthermia of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Materials and methods: An alternating current (AC) magnetic field was used to induce hyperthermia of locally injected MNPs in the left ophthalmic artery of a rat model. To improve adherence on the surface of the endothelium, commercially available MNPs coated with human transferrin glycoproteins were used. After hyperthermia we assessed the extravasation of systemically injected sodium fluorescein (NaF) as well as Evans blue dye (EBD) into the retinal tissue. Results: Spectrofluorometry and fluorescent microscopy image analysis show a significant increase of dye penetration in the retina where hyperthermia of MNPs was applied. Conclusions: Our proposed new technique can allow both small and large dye molecules to cross the BRB. While the results are preliminary and thorough evaluation of the retinal tissue following hyperthermia is necessary, this technique has the potential to be an effective mean for the treatment of various diseases such as retinoblastoma.

To address this issue, we recorded the electroencephalograph (EEG) during a time-estimation task using both informative (positive and negative) and uninformative (neutral) feedback. In the time-frequency domain, uninformative feedback elicited significantly less induced beta-gamma activity than informative feedback. This result suggests that beta-gamma activity is particularly sensitive to feedback that can guide behavioral adjustments, consistent with other work. In contrast, neither theta nor delta activity were sensitive to the difference between negative and neutral feedback, though both frequencies discriminated between positive, and non-positive (neutral or negative) feedback. Interestingly, in the time domain, we observed a linear relationship in the amplitude of the feedback-related negativity (neutral > negative > positive), a component of the event-related brain potential thought to index a specific kind of reinforcement learning signal called a reward prediction error. Taken together, these results suggest that the reinforcement learning system treats neutral feedback as a special case, providing valuable information about the electrophysiological measures used to index the cognitive function of frontal midline cortex.

Acute pain is part of a hypervigilance system that alerts the individual to injury or potential injury of tissues. It can also disturb sleep. Disrupted sleep is often associated with chronic pain states, including those that occur in the orofacial region. The article presents many insights that have been gained in the last few decades into the peripheral and central mechanisms involved in orofacial pain and its modulation, as well as the circuits and processes in the central nervous system that underlie sleep. Although it has become clear that sleep is essential to preserve and maintain health, it has also been found that pain, particularly chronic pain, is commonly associated with disturbed sleep. In the presence of chronic pain, a circular relationship may prevail, with mutual deleterious influences causing an increase in pain and a disruption of sleep. This article also reviews findings that indicate that reducing orofacial pain and improving sleep need to be targeted together in the management of acute to chronic orofacial pain states in order to improve an orofacial pain patient's quality of life, to prevent mood alterations or exacerbation of sleep disorder (e.g., insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing) that can negatively affect their pain, and to promote healing and optimize their health.

The pathway is notably implicated in the initial appearance of the progenitors of oligodendrocytes (OPCs), the glial cells of the central nervous system which after maturation are responsible for axon myelination. In accordance with the requirement for Hedgehog signaling in ventral patterning, the earliest identifiable cells in the oligodendrocyte lineage are derived from the ventral ventricular zone of the developing spinal cord and brain. Here, we present the current knowledge about the involvement of Hedgehog signaling in the strict spatial and temporal regulation which characterizes the initiation and progression of the oligodendrocyte lineage. We notably describe the ability of the Hedgehog signaling to tightly orchestrate the appearance of specific combinations of genes in concert with other pathways. We document the molecular mechanisms controlling Hedgehog temporal activity during OPC specification. The contribution of the pathway to aspects of OPC development different from their specification is also highlighted especially in the optic nerve. Finally, we report the data demonstrating that Hedgehog signaling-dependency is not a universal situation for oligodendrocyte generation as evidenced in the dorsal spinal cord in contrast to the dorsal forebrain.

It represents a large spectrum of disorders with heterogeneous symptoms and distinct clinical features. In addition to the devastating effects it can have on the affected individual, it constitutes a heavy burden to the society in terms of health care costs. Although the exact cause of neurodegeneration is not known, there are plenty of evidences supporting the notion that the immune system is strongly associated with various forms of neurodegenerative diseases. Given the numerous functions of immune cells, a change in their expression can either be beneficial or deleterious to the host. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular processes in neurodegeneration is therefore needed. This could facilitate the development of new therapeutic targets and provide effective means to dampen the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. The overarching aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the roles that the innate and adaptive immune systems play in the central nervous system, and to discuss their beneficial or detrimental effects during neurodegeneration. This paper also critically examines the contribution of immune and inflammatory-mediated responses in the development of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyloid lateral sclerosis by illustrating key findings from animal and human studies.

In a new screening strategy, we performed gene-burden analyses trained with established ALS genes and identified a significant association between loss-of-function (LOF) NEK1 variants and FALS risk. Independently, autozygosity mapping for an isolated community in the Netherlands identified a NEK1 p.Arg261 His variant as a candidate risk factor. Replication analyses of sporadic ALS (SALS) cases and independent control cohorts confirmed significant disease association for both p.Arg261 His (10,589 samples analyzed) and NEK1 LOF variants (3,362 samples analyzed). In total, we observed NEK1 risk variants in nearly 3% of ALS cases. NEK1 has been linked to several cellular functions, including cilia formation, DNA-damage response, microtubule stability, neuronal morphology and axonal polarity. Our results provide new and important insights into ALS etiopathogenesis and genetic etiology.

The onset of pervasive sleep-wake disturbances associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is poorly understood. This study aimed to (a) determine the feasibility of using polysomnography in patients in the acute, hospitalized stage of severe TBI and (b) explore sleep quality and sleep architecture during this stage of recovery, compared to patients with other traumatic injuries. Methods. A cross-sectional case-control design was used. We examined the sleep of 7 patients with severe TBI (17-47 years; 20.3 +/- 15.0 days postinjury) and 6 patients with orthopedic and/or spinal cord injuries (OSCI; 19-58 years; 16.9 +/- 4.9 days postinjury). One night of ambulatory polysomnography was performed at bedside. Results. Compared to OSCI patients, TBI patients showed a significantly longer duration of nocturnal sleep and earlier nighttime sleep onset. Sleep efficiency was low and comparable in both groups. All sleep stages were observed in both groups with normal proportions according to age. Conclusion. Patients in the acute stage of severe TBI exhibit increased sleep duration and earlier sleep onset, suggesting that the injured brain enhances sleep need and/or decreases the ability to maintain wakefulness. As poor sleep efficiency could compromise brain recovery, further studies should investigate whether strategies known to optimize sleep in healthy individuals are efficacious in acute TBI. While there are several inherent challenges, polysomnography is a useful means of examining sleep in the early stage of recovery in patients with severe TBI.

Unfortunately, available data in the literature generally relate mechanical properties of the spinal cord under quasi-static loading conditions, which is not adapted to the study of traumatic behavior, as neurological tissue adopts a viscoelastic behavior. Thus, the objective of this study is to describe mechanical properties of the spinal cord up to mechanical damage, under dynamic loading conditions. A total of 192 porcine cervical to lumbar spinal cord samples were compressed in a transverse direction. Loading conditions included ramp tests at 0.5, 5 or 50s(-1) and cyclic loading at 1, 10 or 20Hz. Results showed that spinal cord behavior was significantly influenced by strain rate. Mechanical damage occurred at 0.64, 0.68 and 0.73 strains for 0.5, 5 or 50s(-1) loadings, respectively. Variations of behavior between the tested strain rates were explained by cyclic loading results, which revealed behavior more or less viscous depending on strain rate. Also, a parameter (stress multiplication factor) was introduced to allow transcription of a stress-strain behavior curve to different strain rates. This factor was described and was significantly different for cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebral heights, and for the strain rates evaluated in this study.

The present research examined whether the core personality trait of extraversion may be one important person-specific factor that plays a role in these associations. Across two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled studies (total ns: Study 1 = 121; Study 2 = 112), we observed significant interactions between OT administration and extraversion predicting prosocial outcomes. For individuals low in extraversion, OT administration relative to placebo led to greater perceived social connection and prosocial tendencies (Study 1) and more positive behavioral responses to help and greater trust of an interaction partner (Study 2). In contrast, OT administration was not beneficial for individuals high in extraversion. Overall, these findings contribute to growing evidence that OT administration has complex, person-specific effects on social behavior, indicating that extraversion plays an important role in these associations.

However, whereas participants in most psychological experiments sit upright, many modern neuroimaging techniques (e.g., fMRI) require participants to lie supine. Sparse findings from electroencephalography and positron emission tomography suggest that body position influences cognitive processes and neural activity. Here we leverage multi-postural magnetoencephalography (MEG) to further unravel how physical stance alters baseline brain activity. We present resting-state MEG data from 12 healthy participants in three orthostatic conditions (i.e., lying supine, reclined at 45A degrees, and sitting upright). Our findings demonstrate that upright, compared to reclined or supine, posture increases left-hemisphere high-frequency oscillatory activity over common speech areas. This proof-of-concept experiment establishes the feasibility of using MEG to examine the influence of posture on brain dynamics. We highlight the advantages and methodological challenges inherent to this approach and lay the foundation for future studies to further investigate this important, albeit little-acknowledged, procedural caveat.

First, adult female yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were exposed to dietary MeHg (0, 0.5, 5, 50 ppm) for 16 weeks throughout the gonadal development period. In different brain regions and liver, GABA-benzodiazepine (BZ), dopamine (D2), estrogen (ERs) and androgen receptors (ARs), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) were measured. Saturation curves revealed a MeHg-dependent increase of the maximum binding (Bmax) of D2 receptor in the hypothalamus versus controls (284-606%), concomitant with a decrease in receptor affinity (up to 984% lower). The activity of MAO was enhanced in different brain regions of exposed fish (240-383% in the hypothalamus). MeHg concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ERs in all brain regions except for the hypothalamus. For the 5 and 50 ppm exposure groups, MeHg concentrations were positively correlated with the number of ARs (130-329% and 225% for brain regions and liver, respectively compared to controls). In vitro exposures were conducted in parallel using different fish species (giant danio, goldfish, yellow perch, lake trout) to test the inhibitory potential of MeHgCl or HgCl2 (0.01-320 mu M). There was no evidence of impacts on receptors, but the activities of GS, GAD and MAO (except in yellow perch) were inhibited by both MeHgCland HgCl2 in a species-dependent manner. In general, these findings show that environmentally relevant dietary exposures to MeHg can affect key neuroendocrine receptors and enzymes important to fish reproduction.

Differential actinodin1 regulation in zebrafish and mouse appendages	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							APICAL ECTODERMAL RIDGE; TRUNK NEURAL CREST; LIMB DEVELOPMENT; IN-VIVO; GENE-EXPRESSION; HOMEOBOX GENES; CELL-MIGRATION; FIN MESENCHYME; CAUDAL FIN; EVOLUTION	The fin-to-limb transition is an important evolutionary step in the colonization of land and diversification of all terrestrial vertebrates. We previously identified a gene family in zebrafish, termed actinodin, which codes for structural proteins crucial for the formation of actinotrichia, rigid fibrils of the teleost fin. Interestingly, this gene family is absent from all tetrapod genomes examined to date, suggesting that it was lost during limb evolution. To shed light on the disappearance of this gene family, and the consequences on fin-to-limb transition, we characterized actinodin regulatory elements. Using fluorescent reporters in transgenic zebrafish, we identified tissue-specific cis-acting regulatory elements responsible for actinodin1 (and1) expression in the ectodermal and mesenchymal cell populations of the fins, respectively. Mutagenesis of potential transcription factor binding sites led to the identification of one binding site crucial for and1 expression in ectodermal,cells. We show that these regulatory elements are partially functional in mouse limb buds in a tissue-specific manner. Indeed, the zebrafish regulatory elements target expression to the dorsal and ventral ectoderm of mouse limb buds. Absence of expression in the apical ectodermal ridge is observed in both mouse and zebrafish. However, cells of the mouse limb bud mesoderm do not express the transgene, in contrast to zebrafish. Altogether these results hint for a change in regulation of and1 during evolution that led to the downregulation and eventual loss of this gene from tetrapod genomes.

Evidence demonstrating superior efficacy to justify the routine use of bioactive coils over bare coils is limited. We compared the periprocedural and clinical outcome after bioactive and bare platinum coiling for intracranial aneurysms. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Knowledge Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing bioactive and bare coils. The methodological quality was evaluated to assess bias risk. Periprocedural outcomes and mid-term outcomes were compared. Results Five independent RCTs comparing bioactive (n=1084) and bare coils (n=1084) were identified. Periprocedural outcome was similar for both groups. Bioactive coiling increased the rate of complete aneurysm occlusion (47% vs 40%; RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.31); p=0.006) and reduced the rate of residual aneurysm neck at 10 months compared with bare coiling in the mid-term (26% vs 31%; RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.96); p=0.01). There were no differences in aneurysm recurrence, aneurysm rupture, stroke, neurological death, modified Rankin Scale score and reinterventions. Subgroup analysis for the three RCTs on hydrogel coils demonstrated reduction of residual aneurysms compared with bare coiling (25% vs 34%; RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.99); p=0.04). Conclusions Bioactive coils ensure a higher rate of medium-term complete aneurysm occlusion while reducing the rate of residual neck aneurysms compared with bare coiling in the mid-term. Hydrogel coils reduce residual aneurysms compared with bare coils. While there is level 1a evidence to show more complete aneurysm occlusion, longer term follow-up is needed to determine if this translates into clinical significance.

Patients are hypotonic and areflexic from birth, with abnormal facial features and atrophic muscles. Progressive peripheral neuropathy eventually confines them to a wheelchair in the second decade of life, and death occurs by the fourth decade. We here define the neuropathologic features of the disease in autopsy tissues from eight cases. Both developmental and neurodegenerative features were found. Hypoplasia or absence of the major telencephalic commissures and a hypoplasia of corticospinal tracts to half the normal size, were the major neurodevelopmental defects we observed. Despite being a neurodegenerative disease, preservation of brain weight and a conspicuous absence of neuronal or glial cell death were signal features of this disease. Small tumor-like overgrowths of axons, termed axonomas, were found in the central and peripheral nervous system, indicating attempted axonal regeneration. We conclude that the neurodegenerative deficits in HMSN/ACC are primarily caused by an axonopathy superimposed upon abnormal development, affecting peripheral but also central nervous system axons, all ultimately because of a genetic defect in the axonal cotransporter KCC3.

The recurrent seizures in epilepsy, particularly in the condition called status epilepticus, can cause permanent neurological damage, resulting in cognitive dysfunction and other serious neurological conditions. In this study, we used an in vitro model of status epilepticus to examine the role of calpain in the degeneration of hippocampal neurons. We grew neurons on a culture system that allowed studying the dendritic and axonal domains separately from the cell bodies. We found that a recently characterized calpain substrate, the neurotrophin receptor TrkB, is cleaved in the dendritic and axonal domain of neurons committed to die, and this constitutes an early step in the neuronal degeneration process. While the full-length TrkB (TrkB-FL) levels decreased, the truncated form of TrkB (Tc TrkB-FL) concurrently increased, leading to a TrkB-FL/Tc TrkB-FL imbalance, which is thought to be causally linked to neurodegeneration. We further show that the treatment with N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, a specific calpain activity blocker, fully protects the neuronal processes from degeneration, prevents the TrkB-FL/Tc TrkB-FL imbalance, and provides full neuroprotection. Moreover, the use of the TrkB antagonist ANA 12 at the time when the levels of TrkB-FL were significantly decreased, totally blocked neuronal death, suggesting that Tc TrkB-FL may have a role in neuronal death. These results indicate that the imbalance of these neurotrophins receptors plays a key role in neurite degeneration induced by seizures. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Failed reinnervation in aging skeletal muscle	SKELETAL MUSCLE			English	Article						Aging; Skeletal muscle; Denervation; Neurotrophins; MicroRNA; Muscle atrophy; Sarcopenia; Reinnervation	ENHANCES FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; SPINAL CORD INJURY; NEUROMUSCULAR-JUNCTION; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; AXON REGENERATION; TRKB EXPRESSION; AGED ANIMALS; MOTOR UNITS; DENERVATION; SARCOPENIA	Background: Skeletal muscle displays a marked accumulation of denervated myofibers at advanced age, which coincides with an acceleration of muscle atrophy. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that the accumulation of denervated myofibers in advanced age is due to failed reinnervation by examining muscle from young adult (YA) and very old (VO) rats and from a murine model of sporadic denervation secondary to neurotrypsin over-expression (Sarco mouse). Results: Both aging rat muscle and Sarco mouse muscle exhibited marked fiber-type grouping, consistent with repeating cycles of denervation and reinnervation, yet in VO muscle, rapsyn at the endplate increased and was associated with only a 10 % decline in acetylcholine receptor (AChR) intensity, whereas in Sarco mice, there was a decline in rapsyn and a 25 % decrease in AChR intensity. Transcripts of muscle-specific kinase (21-fold), acetylcholine receptor subunits a (68-fold), epsilon (threefold) and gamma (47-fold), neural cell adhesion molecule (66-fold), and runt-related transcription factor 1 (33-fold) were upregulated in VO muscle of the rat, consistent with the marked persistent denervation evidenced by a large proportion of very small fibers (> 20 %). In the Sarco mice, there were much smaller increases in denervation transcripts (0-3.5-fold) and accumulation of very small fibers (2-6 %) compared to the VO rat, suggesting a reduced capacity for reinnervation in aging muscle. Despite the marked persistent denervation in the VO rat muscle, transcripts of neurotrophins involved in promoting axonal sprouting following denervation exhibited no increase, and several miRNAs predicted to suppress neurotrophins were elevated in VO rat. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that the accumulation of denervated fibers with aging is due to failed reinnervation and that this may be affected by a limited neurotrophin response that mediates axonal sprouting following denervation.

Sensorimotor control of vocal pitch and formant frequencies in Parkinson's disease	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Sensorimotor control; Speech production; Parkinson's disease; Vocal pitch; Formant frequencies	SPEECH MOTOR CONTROL; SOMATOSENSORY FEEDBACK; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; ADAPTATION; RESPONSES; MOVEMENTS; DEFICITS; HEARING	Background: Auditory feedback reflects information on multiple speech parameters including fundamental frequency (pitch) and formant properties. Inducing auditory errors in these acoustic parameters during speech production has been used to examine the manner in which auditory feedback is integrated with ongoing speech motor processes. This integration has been shown to be impaired in disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), in which individuals exhibit difficulty adjusting to altered sensory-motor relationships. The current investigation examines whether such sensorimotor impairments affect fundamental frequency and formant parameters of speech differentially. Methods: We employed a sensorimotor compensation paradigm to investigate the mechanisms underlying the control of vocal pitch and formant parameters. Individuals with PD and age-matched controls prolonged a speech vowel in the context of a word while the fundamental or first formant frequency of their auditory feedback was altered unexpectedly on random trials, using two magnitudes of perturbation. Results: Compared with age-matched controls, individuals with PD exhibited a larger compensatory response to fundamental frequency perturbations, in particular in response to the smaller magnitude alteration. In contrast, the group with PD showed reduced compensation to first formant frequency perturbations. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the neural processing impairment of PD differentially affects the processing of auditory feedback for the control of fundamental and formant frequency. The heightened modulation of fundamental frequency in response to auditory perturbations may reflect a change in sensory weighting due to somatosensory deficits associated with the larynx, while the reduced ability to modulate vowel formants may result from impaired activation of the oral articulatory musculature.

This study utilized both spatial and temporal downscaling approaches to develop intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relations for sub-daily rainfall extremes in the Perth airport area. A multiple regression-based statistical downscaling model tool was used for spatial downscaling of daily rainfall using general circulation models (GCMs) (Hadley Centre's GCM and Canadian Global Climate Model) climate variables. A simple scaling regime was identified for 30minutes to 24hours duration of observed annual maximum (AM) rainfall. Then, statistical properties of sub-daily AM rainfall were estimated by scaling an invariant model based on the generalized extreme value distribution. RMSE, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and percentage bias values were estimated to check the accuracy of downscaled sub-daily rainfall. This proved the capability of the proposed approach in developing a linkage between large-scale GCM daily variables and extreme sub-daily rainfall events at a given location. Finally IDF curves were developed for future periods, which show similar extreme rainfall decreasing trends for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s for both GCMs.	[Herath, Sujeewa Malwila; Sarukkalige, Priyantha Ranjan] Curtin Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Perth, WA, Australia; [Van Thanh Van Nguyen] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Herath, SM (reprint author), Curtin Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Perth, WA, Australia.	mudiyanselage.s.herath@postgrad.curtin.edu.au			Australian Postgraduate Award (APA); Curtin University Research Scholarship	Financial support of an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) and Curtin University Research Scholarship.		40	1	1	0	11	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0262-6667	2150-3435		HYDROLOG SCI J	Hydrol.

Temporal delays in trauma craniotomies	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; trauma craniotomy; acute epidural hematoma; acute subdural hematoma; quality of care; delay in treatment; surgery	ACUTE SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; ACUTE STROKE; COMATOSE PATIENTS; EPIDURAL HEMATOMA; EMERGENCY; THROMBOLYSIS; PROGNOSIS; MORTALITY; SCALE; CARE	OBJECTIVE The Brain Trauma Foundation recommendation regarding the timing of surgical evacuation of epidural hematomas and subdural hematomas is to perform the procedure as soon as possible. Indeed, faster evacuation is associated with better outcome. However, to the authors' knowledge, no study has looked at where delays in intrahospital care occurred for patients suffering from traumatic intracranial mass lesions. The goals of this study were as follows: 1) to characterize the performance of a Level 1 trauma center in terms of delays for emergency trauma craniotomies, 2) to review step by step where delays occurred in patient care, and 3) to propose ways to improve performance. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted covering a 5-year period of all emergency trauma craniotomies. Demographic data, injury severity, neurological status, and functional outcome data were collected. The time elapsed between emergency department (ED) arrival and CT imaging, between CT imaging and arrival at the operating room (OR), between ED arrival and OR arrival, between OR arrival and skin incision, and between ED arrival and skin incision were calculated. Patients were also subcategorized as either having immediate life-threatening emergencies (EO) or life threatening emergencies (El). The operative technique was also reviewed (standard craniotomy opening vs immediate bur hole decompression followed by craniotomy). RESULTS The study included 166 patients. Of these, 58 (35%) were classified into the EO group and 108 (64.2%) into the El group. The median ED-to-CT delay was 54 minutes with no significant difference between the E0 and the E1 groups. The median CT-to-OR time delay was 57 minutes. The median delay for the EO group was 39 minutes and that for the El group was 70 minutes (p = 0.002). The median delay from ED to OR arrival for patients with a CT scanning done at an outside hospital was 75 minutes. The median delay from ED to OR arrival was 85 minutes for the EO group and 127 minutes for the El group (p < 0.0001). The median delay from OR arrival to skin incision was 35 minutes (EO: median 27 minutes; El: median 39 minutes; p < 0.0001). The median total time elapsed between ED arrival and skin incision was 150 minutes (EO: median 131 minutes; El: median 180 minutes). Overall, only 17% of patients underwent immediate bur hole decompression, but the proportion climbed to 41% in the EO group. A lower Glasgow Coma Scale score was associated with a shorter delay (p = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS A long delay until surgery still exists for patients requiring urgent mass lesion evacuation. Many factors contribute to this delay, including performing imaging and transfer to and preparation in the OR. Strategies can be implemented to reduce delays and improve the delivery of care.

Typically, a formal anterior approach is performed through open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The authors recently developed a technique for anterior release and fusion in thoracic scoliosis referred to as "posterior convex release and interbody fusion" (PCRIF). This technique is performed via the posterior-only approach typically used for posterior instrumentation and fusion and thus avoids a formal anterior approach. In this article the authors describe the technique and its use in 9 patients-to prevent a crankshaft phenomenon in 3 patients and to optimize the correction in 6 patients with a severe thoracic curve showing poor reducibility. After Ponte osteotomies at the levels requiring anterior release and fusion, intervertebral discs are approached from the convex side of the scoliosis. The annulus on the convex side of the scoliosis is incised from the lateral border of the pedicle to the lateral annulus while visualizing and protecting the pleura and spinal cord. The annulus in contact with the pleura and the anterior longitudinal ligament are removed before completing the discectomies and preparing the endplates. The PCRIF was performed at 3 levels in 4 patients and at 4 levels in 5 patients. Mean correction of the main thoracic curve, blood loss, and length of stay were 74.9%, 1290 ml, and 7.6 days, respectively. No neurological deficit, implant failure, or pseudarthrosis was observed at the last follow-up. Two patients had pleural effusion postoperatively, with 1 of them requiring placement of a chest tube. One patient had pulmonary edema secondary to fluid overload, while another patient underwent reoperation for a deep wound infection 3 weeks after the initial surgery. The technique is primarily indicated in skeletally immature patients with open triradiate cartilage and/or severe scoliosis. It can be particularly useful if there is significant vertebral rotation because access to the disc and anterior longitudinal ligament from the convex side will become safer. The PCRIF is an alternative to the formal anterior approach and does not require repositioning between the anterior and posterior stages, which prolongs the surgery and can be associated with an increased complication rate. The procedure can be done in the presence of preexisting pulmonary morbidity such as pleural adhesions and decreased pulmonary function because it does not require mobilization of the lung or single-lung ventilation. However, PCRIF can still be associated with pulmonary complications such as a pleural effusion, and care should be taken to avoid iatrogenic injury to the pleura. Placement of a deep wound drain at the level of the PCRIF is strongly recommended if postoperative bleeding is anticipated, to decrease the risk of pleural effusion.

Recent findings Recent studies on cSLE epidemiology supported previous findings that cSLE patients have more severe disease and tend to accumulate damage rapidly. Lupus nephritis remains frequent and is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In the past year unfortunately there were no new reproducible, biomarker studies to help direct therapy of renal disease. However, some progress was made in neuropsychiatric disease assessment, with a new and promising automated test to screen for cognitive dysfunction reported. There were no prospective interventional treatment trials designed for patients with cSLE published in the last year, but some studies involving children are currently active and might improve the therapeutic options for patients with cSLE. Summary There is a need to get a better understanding of pathogenesis and identify new biomarkers in cSLE to more accurately predict outcomes. New insights into characterization of different clinical manifestations may enable to optimize individual interventions and influence the prognosis.

Health-Related Quality of Life in Survivors of High-Risk Neuroblastoma After Stem Cell Transplant: A National Population-Based Perspective	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						neuroblastoma; quality of life; stem cell transplant	CHILDRENS-ONCOLOGY-GROUP; CHILDHOOD-CANCER SURVIVOR; MARROW-TRANSPLANTATION; WILMS-TUMOR; OTOTOXICITY; CHEMOTHERAPY	PurposeThis study aimed to estimate the burden of morbidity, in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQL), in survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma (NBL) after myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Patients and methodsA national population-based survey was undertaken of survivors of high-risk NBL (N = 99), diagnosed between 1991 and 2010 and treated with HSCT. Parents completed a proxy questionnaire incorporating two HRQL measures, Health Utilities Index (HUI) 2 and 3. Children >12 years of age provided self-assessments. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance were used to assess differences. Comparative data were obtained from previously published work and Statistics Canada's 1998 National Population Health Survey. ResultsOn a scale of 0 (being dead) to 1.0 (perfect health), mean HRQL utility scores were 0.89 (SD = 0.11) in HUI2 and 0.84 (SD = 0.18) in HUI3. Parents reported morbidity in sensation (52.5%), pain (30.3%), cognition (28.0%), and emotion (24.2%) in HUI2 and in hearing (38.4%), pain (30.3%), cognition (27.3%), and speech (23.2%) in HUI3. HRQL was not significantly different compared to NBL survivors treated without HSCT, but was less than in nontransplanted survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms tumor, and children in the general population, yet higher than in survivors of brain tumors. ConclusionsHRQL is compromised in high-risk NBL survivors treated with and without HSCT. A differential effect on hearing reflects additional exposure to platinum-based chemotherapy. These results should inform long-term care and the development of new therapeutic interventions. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hence, methods for quantifying morphological variations in the brain anatomy, including groupwise shape analyses, are becoming increasingly important for studying neurological disorders. In this paper, a novel groupwise shape analysis approach is proposed to detect regional morphological alterations in subcortical structures between two study groups, e.g., healthy and pathological subjects. The proposed scheme extracts smoothed triangulated surface meshes from segmented binary maps, and establishes reliable point-to-point correspondences among the population of surfaces using a spectral matching method. Mean curvature features are incorporated in the matching process, in order to increase the accuracy of the established surface correspondence. The mean shapes are created as the geometric mean of all surfaces in each group, and a distance map between these shapes is used to characterize the morphological changes between the two study groups. The resulting distance map is further analyzed to check for statistically significant differences between two populations. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on two separate subcortical structures (hippocampus and putamen). Furthermore, the proposed methodology is validated in a clinical application for detecting abnormal subcortical shape variations in Alzheimer's disease. Experimental results show that the proposed method is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms, has less computational cost, and is more sensitive to small morphological variations in patients with neuropathologies.

Vision deficits in glaucoma result from the selective loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC). Glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation has been proposed to contribute to disease pathophysiology, but whether this response is harmful or beneficial for RGC survival is not well understood. To test this, we characterized the role of ibudilast, a clinically approved cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor with preferential affinity for PDE type 4 (PDE4). Here, we demonstrate that intraocular administration of ibudilast dampened macroglia and microglia reactivity in the retina and optic nerve hence decreasing production of proinflammatory cytokines in a rat model of ocular hypertension. Importantly, ibudilast promoted robust RGC soma survival, prevented axonal degeneration, and improved anterograde axonal transport in glaucomatous eyes without altering intraocular pressure. Intriguingly, ocular hypertension triggered upregulation of PDE4 subtype A in Muller glia, and ibudilast stimulated CAMP accumulation in these cells. Co-administration of ibudilast with Rp-cAMPS, a cell-permeable and non-hydrolysable cAMP analog that inhibits protein kinase A (PICA), completely blocked ibudilast-induced neuroprotection. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ibudilast, a safe and well-tolerated glial cell modulator, attenuates gliosis, decreases levels of proinflammatory mediators, and enhances neuronal viability in glaucoma through activation of the cAMP/PICA pathway. This study provides insight into PDE4 signaling as a potential target to counter the harmful effects associated with chronic gliosis and neuroinflammation in glaucoma. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To quantify this morphological development, it is necessary to extract the interface between gray matter and white matter, which is particularly challenging due to changing tissue contrast during brain maturation. We employed the well-established CIVET pipeline to extract this cortical surface, with point correspondence across subjects, using a surface-based spherical registration. We then developed a variant of the pipeline, called NEOCIVET, that quantified cortical folding using mean curvature and sulcal depth while addressing the well-known problems of poor and temporally-varying gray/white contrast as well as motion artifact in neonatal MRI. NEOCIVET includes: i) a tissue classification technique that analyzed multi-atlas texture patches using the nonlocal mean estimator and subsequently applied a label fusion approach based on a joint probability between templates, ii) neonatal template construction based on age-specific sub-groups, and iii) masking of non-interesting structures using label-fusion approaches. These techniques replaced modules that might be suboptimal for regional analysis of poor-contrast neonatal cortex. The proposed segmentation method showed more accurate results in subjects with various ages and with various degrees of motion compared to state-of-the-art methods. In the analysis of 158 preterm-born neonates, many with multiple scans (n = 231; 26-40 weeks postmenstrual age at scan), NEOCIVET identified increases in cortical folding over time in numerous cortical regions (mean curvature: + 0.003/week; sulcal depth:+ 0.04mm/week) while folding did not change in major sulci that are known to develop early (corrected p < 0.05). The proposed pipeline successfully mapped cortical structural development, supporting current models of cerebral morphogenesis, and furthermore, revealed impairment of cortical folding in extremely preterm newborns relative to relatively late preterm newborns, demonstrating its potential to provide biomarkers of prematurity-related developmental outcome.

We perform extensive simulations to compare the activity generated on the scalp by different models of cortical activation, based on intracranial EEG findings reported in the literature. The spatial activation is modeled as a cortical patch of constant activation or as random sets of small generators (0.1 to 3 cm(2) each) concentrated in a cortical region. Temporal activation models for the generation of oscillatory activity are either equal phase or random phase across the cortical patches. The results show that smooth or random spatial activation profiles produce scalp electric potential distributions with the same shape. Also, in the generation of oscillatory activity, multiple cortical generators with random phase produce scalp activity attenuated on average only 2 to 4 times compared to generators with equal phase. Sparse asynchronous cortical generators can produce measurable scalp EEG. This is a possible explanation for seemingly paradoxical observations of simultaneous disorganized intracranial activity and scalp EEG signals. Thus, the standard interpretation of scalp EEG might constitute an oversimplification of the underlying brain activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We measured responses to red-green (RG) and achromatic (ACH) high contrast sinewave counter-phasing rings with and without adaptation, within a block design. The signal for the RG test stimulus was reduced following both RG and ACH adaptation, whereas the signal for the ACH test was unaffected by either adaptor. These results provide compelling evidence that the human LGN and SC have significant capacity for color adaptation. Since in the LGN redgreen responses are mediated by P cells, these findings are in contrast to earlier neurophysiological data from non-human primates that have shown weak or no contrast adaptation in the P pathway. Cross-adaptation of the red-green color response by achromatic contrast suggests unselective response adaptation and points to a dual role for P cells in responding to both color and achromatic contrast. We further show that subcortical adaptation is not restricted to the geniculostriate system, but is also present in the superior colliculus (SC), an oculomotor region that until recently, has been thought to be color-blind. Our data show that the human SC not only responds to red-green color contrast, but like the LGN, shows reliable but unselective adaptation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mechanisms of Saccadic Suppression in Primate Cortical Area V4	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; LFP; primate; saccades; suppression; V4	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; INTERNEURONAL CORRELATIONS; NEURONAL EXCITABILITY; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY	Psychophysical studies have shown that subjects are often unaware of visual stimuli presented around the time of an eye movement. This saccadic suppression is thought to be a mechanism for maintaining perceptual stability. The brain might accomplish saccadic suppression by reducing the gain of visual responses to specific stimuli or by simply suppressing firing uniformly for all stimuli. Moreover, the suppression might be identical across the visual field or concentrated at specific points. To evaluate these possibilities, we recorded from individual neurons in cortical area V4 of nonhuman primates trained to execute saccadic eye movements. We found that both modes of suppression were evident in the visual responses of these neurons and that the two modes showed different spatial and temporal profiles: while gain changes started earlier and were more widely distributed across visual space, nonspecific suppression was found more often in the peripheral visual field, after the completion of the saccade. Peripheral suppression was also associated with increased noise correlations and stronger local field potential oscillations in the alpha frequency band. This pattern of results suggests that saccadic suppression shares some of the circuitry responsible for allocating voluntary attention.

MTR recovery in brain lesions in the BECOME study of glatiramer acetate vs interferon beta-1b	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS LESIONS; QUANTITATIVE MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; GROWTH-FACTOR; B-CELLS; DEMYELINATION; MS; REMYELINATION; MECHANISMS; THERAPY; TRIAL	Objective: To compare magnetization transfer changes in new brain MRI lesions identified during monthly imaging in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) randomized to treatment with 250 mu g subcutaneous interferon-beta-1b (IFN-beta-1b) every other day or daily 20 mg glatiramer acetate (GA) in a post hoc study using data from the Betaseron Versus Copaxone for Relapsing Remitting or CIS Forms of MS Using Triple Dose Gad 3 T MRI (BECOME) trial. Methods: T1-weighted images acquired with and without fat saturation pulses in the BECOME study were evaluated and found to exhibit magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) effects, and were used to compute MTR images (FSMTR). Forty-three participants who had the required imaging and new lesions, from the 75 originally randomized into the BECOME study, were included in this post hoc analysis and evaluated longitudinally during treatment to determine FSMTRDrop, an experimental measure of the completeness of FSMTR recovery in new lesions. Two sets of new brain MRI lesions were defined, one based on the appearance of gadolinium contrast enhancement (Gd lesions) and the other based on FSMTR decreases (Delta FSMTR lesions). Results: A total of 887 Gd lesions were identified in 43 participants (19 GA, 24 IFN-beta-1b) and 321 Delta FSMTR lesions in 32 participants (16 GA, 16 IFN-beta-1b). Participants randomized to GA exhibited greater average postlesion FSMTR recovery than did those randomized to IFN-beta-1b in both Gd (p < 0.0001) and Delta FSMTR (p < 0.0001) lesions. Conclusions: New brain lesions that developed during treatment with GA exhibited evidence of greater FSMTR recovery than during treatment with IFN-beta-1b. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that MTR recovery in patients with MS with new MRI brain lesions is greater with GA than with IFN-beta-1b.

The presence of multiple lesions in CNS locations commonly affected by MS, along with the presence of both enhancing and nonenhancing lesions, can facilitate a diagnosis of MS at the time of a first attack, whereas the accrual of serial lesions or new clinical attacks over time confirms the diagnosis in patients not meeting such criteria at onset. T2 and enhancing lesion accrual could serve as a primary outcome metric for pediatric MS clinical trials of selected therapies with anti-inflammatory activity in order to facilitate feasible trial size numbers. More-advanced MRI techniques reveal the impact of MS on tissue integrity within both T2-bright and T1-hypointense lesions and regions of normal-appearing tissue. Volumetric MRI analyses quantify the impact of MS on age-expected brain growth, and fMRI reveals activation and resting-state functional connectivity patterns in patients with pediatric MS that differ from those seen in healthy age-matched youth. Such studies are of critical importance because MS onset during childhood may profoundly influence maturing and actively myelinating neural networks. High-field MRI visualizes MS pathology at a near-microscopic level and has the potential to more fully explain mechanisms for cognitive impairment, fatigue, and disability in patients with pediatric MS.

Observations that pediatric-and adult-onset MS share the same genetic and environmental risk factors support the view that these conditions represent essentially the same illness manifesting at different ages. Nonetheless, special consideration must be given when CNS inflammation manifests in early life, at a time when multiple organs (including immune and nervous systems) are actively maturing. CSF analysis in pediatric-onset MS points to chronic CNS inflammation, supported by observations from limited pathologic material available for study. Emerging results implicate abnormalities in both effector and regulatory T cell subsets, and potentially immune senescence, in children with MS. Although CNS-directed antibodies (including antibodies recognizing myelin antigens; Kir4.1) can be documented in pediatric-onset MS, their pathophysiologic significance (as in adults) remains unclear. This is in contrast to the presence of serum and/or CSF antibodies recognizing aquaporin-4, which, when measured using validated cell-based assays, supports the diagnosis of a neuromyelitis optica spectrumdisorder, distinct from MS. Presence of anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies documented with similar cell-based assays may also be associated with pathophysiologically distinct disease phenotypes in children. The substantial impact of pediatriconset MS on normal brain development and function underscores the importance of elucidating both the immunobiology and neurobiology of disease. Ongoing efforts are aimed at developing and validating biological measures that define pathophysiologically distinct monophasic and chronic forms of pediatric CNS demyelination.

Canadian Perinatal Surveillance	Effect of Folic Acid Food Fortification in Canada on Congenital Heart Disease Subtypes	CIRCULATION			English	Article						association; folic acid; heart defects, congenital; primary prevention	NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT; CURRENT KNOWLEDGE; OROFACIAL CLEFTS; INFANT-MORTALITY; SUPPLEMENTATION; PREVALENCE; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have yielded inconsistent results for the effects of periconceptional multivitamins containing folic acid and of folic acid food fortification on congenital heart defects (CHDs). METHODS: We carried out a population-based cohort study (N=5 901 701) of all live births and stillbirths (including late-pregnancy terminations) delivered at >= 20 weeks' gestation in Canada (except Quebec and Manitoba) from 1990 to 2011. CHD cases were diagnosed at birth and in infancy (n=72 591). We compared prevalence rates and temporal trends in CHD subtypes before and after 1998 (the year that fortification was mandated). An ecological study based on 22 calendar years, 14 geographic areas, and Poisson regression analysis was used to quantify the effect of folic acid food fortification on nonchromosomal CHD subtypes (n=66 980) after controlling for changes in maternal age, prepregnancy diabetes mellitus, preterm preeclampsia, multiple birth, and termination of pregnancy. RESULTS: The overall birth prevalence rate of CHDs was 12.3 per 1000 total births. Rates of most CHD subtypes decreased between 1990 and 2011 except for atrial septal defects, which increased significantly. Folic acid food fortification was associated with lower rates of conotruncal defects (adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.85), coarctation of the aorta (aRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.96), ventricular septal defects (aRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.96), and atrial septal defects (aRR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95) but not severe nonconotruncal heart defects (aRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65-1.03) and other heart or circulatory system abnormalities (aRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: The association between food fortification with folic acid and a reduction in the birth prevalence of specific CHDs provides modest evidence for additional benefit from this intervention.

Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) are involved in the recognition of famous people. However, it is still a matter of debate whether the semantic processing of names or pictures of famous people has an impact on the activation of ATLs. The aim of this study was to explore the pattern of activation associated with a semantic processing of famous people based on face and written name stimuli. Fifteen healthy young individuals participated in our fMRI study, in which they were asked to perform a semantic categorization judgment task, based on profession, of visually presented pictures, and names of famous people. Neuroimaging findings showed a common pattern of activation for faces and names mainly involving the inferior frontal regions, the posterior temporal lobe, the visual cortex, and the ATLs. We found that the comparison names vs. pictures lead to significant activation in the anterior superior temporal gyrus. On the other hand, faces vs. names seemed associated with increased activation in the medial ATL. Moreover, our results demonstrated that the functional connectivity network anchored to the medial ATL, compared to the anterior STG, is more connected to the bilateral occipital lobe and fusiform gyrus that are regions implicated in the visual system and visual processing of faces. This study provides critical evidence of the differential involvement of ATL regions in semantics of famous people.

Blockade of VM NMDAR, however, enhances brain stimulation reward (BSR), the results can be explained by a reduction in the inhibitory drive on DA neurons that is also under the control of glutamate. In this study, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) in anesthetized animals to determine whether this enhancement is associated with a change in phasic DA release in the nucleus accumbens. Rats were implanted with a stimulation electrode in the dorsal-raphe (DR) and bilateral cannulae above the VM and trained to selfadminister trains of electrical stimulation. The curve-shift method was used to evaluate the effect of a single dose (0.825 nmol/0.5 mu l/side) of the NMDAR antagonist, (2R,4S)-4-(3-Phosphopropyl)-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid (PPPA), on reward. These animals were then anesthetized and DA release was measured during delivery of electrical stimulation before and after VM microinjection of the vehicle followed by PPPA. As expected, phasic DA release and operant responding depended similarly on the frequency of rewarding electrical stimulation. As anticipated, PPPA produced a significant reward enhancement. Unexpectedly, PPPA produced a decrease in the magnitude of DA transients at all tested frequencies. To test whether this decrease resulted from excessive activation of DA neurons, we injected apomorphine 20 min after PPPA microinjection. At a dose (100 mu g s.c.) sufficient to reduce DA firing under control conditions, apomorphine restored electrical stimulation-induced DA transients. These findings show that combined electrical stimulation and VM NMDARs blockade induce DA inactivation, an effect that indirectly demonstrates that VM NMDARs blockade enhances reward by potentiating stimulation-induced excitation in the mesoaccumbens DA pathway.

Madan			Diverse activation pathways in class A GPCRs converge near the G-protein-coupling region	NATURE			English	Article							RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; STRUCTURAL INSIGHTS; MECHANISM	Class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of membrane proteins that mediate a wide variety of physiological functions, including vision, neurotransmission and immune responses(1-4). They are the targets of nearly one-third of all prescribed medicinal drugs(5) such as beta blockers and antipsychotics. GPCR activation is facilitated by extracellular ligands and leads to the recruitment of intracellular G proteins(3,6). Structural rearrangements of residue contacts in the transmembrane domain serve as 'activation pathways' that connect the ligand-binding pocket to the G-protein-coupling region within the receptor. In order to investigate the similarities in activation pathways across class A GPCRs, we analysed 27 GPCRs from diverse subgroups for which structures of active, inactive or both states were available. Here we show that, despite the diversity in activation pathways between receptors, the pathways converge near the G-protein-coupling region. This convergence is mediated by a highly conserved structural rearrangement of residue contacts between transmembrane helices 3, 6 and 7 that releases G-protein-contacting residues. The convergence of activation pathways may explain how the activation steps initiated by diverse ligands enable GPCRs to bind a common repertoire of G proteins.	[Venkatakrishnan, A.

Additionally, a single injection of E2 rapidly (within 30 min) enhances amphetamine-induced DA release. In situ studies show that this rapid effect of E2 occurs specifically within the dorsal striatum (DS). The present study investigated the in vivo effects of E2 infused into the DS, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or the substantia nigra (SN) on dorsal striatal DA release. Rats were OVX and implanted with a silastic tube containing 5% E2 in cholesterol, previously shown to mimic low physiological serum concentrations of 18-32 pg/ml. Single-probe microdialysis was used to measure extracellular DA levels in the DS. In addition, DA release was measured subsequent to systemic injections of the indirect DA agonist, AMPH (0.5 mg/kg SC), administered simultaneously with E2 (0.544 mu g/100 mu l) or its vehicle, cyclodextrin (VEH) (0.520 mu g/100 mu l). Local infusions of E2 into the DS resulted in a greater amphetamine-induced dorsal striatal DA release in comparison to vehicle. Local infusions of E2 into the mPFC or the SN did not result in an enhancement of amphetamine-induced DA levels in the DS. These studies suggest that increases in dorsal striatal DA release in response to systemic E2 are a consequence of E2 actions within the DS itself. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterized by all of these pathological events. However, the mechanisms by which p75(NTR) may be implicated at each stage of DR pathology remain poorly understood. Using a streptozotocin mouse model of diabetic retinopathy, we report that p75(NTR) is upregulated very early in glia and in pericytes to mediate ligand-dependent induction of inflammatory cytokines, disruption of the neuro-glia-vascular unit, promotion of blood-retina barrier breakdown, edema, and neuronal death. In a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, mimicking proliferative DR, p75(NTR)-dependent inflammation leads to ischemia and pathological angiogenesis through Semaphorin 3A. The acute use of antagonists of p75(NTR) or antagonists of the ligand proNGF suppresses each distinct phase of pathology, ameliorate disease, and prevent disease progression. Thus, our study documents novel disease mechanisms and validates druggable targets for diabetic retinopathy.	[Barcelona, Pablo F.; Galan, Alba; Jmaeff, Sean; Saragovi, H.

The drugs and non-pharmacological approaches used for optimal sedation in ventilated children are reviewed, and specifically the rationale for drug selection, including short- and long-term efficacy and safety aspects of the selected drugs. The specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of sedative drugs in the critically ill child and consequences for dosing are presented. Furthermore, we discuss different sedation strategies and their adverse events, such as iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome and delirium.

While diagnosis of this condition is generally well-defined clinically, patients often appear to be awake despite an absence of behavioral signs of awareness, which to the family can be confusing, leading them to believe the loved one is aware of their surroundings. This inequality of agreement can be very distressing. Currently, no cure for the VS is available; as a result, patients may remain in this condition for the rest of their lives, which in some cases amount to decades. Recent advances in stem cell approaches for the treatment of other neurological conditions may now provide an opportunity to intervene in this syndrome. This mini review will address the development of VS, its diagnosis, affected cerebral structures, and the underlying basis of how stem cells can offer therapeutic promise that would take advantage of the often long-term features associated with this maladie to effect a repair of the severely damaged circuitry. In addition, current limitations of this treatment strategy, including a lack of animal models, few long-term clinical studies that might identify benefits of stem cell treatment, and the potential for development of tumors are considered.

Leadership in appropriately planning a youth's transition and in care coordination among health care, educational, vocational, and community services providers may assist in preventing gaps in care, delayed entry into the adult care system, and/or health crises for their adolescent patients. Youth whose neurologic conditions result in cognitive or physical disability and their families may need additional support during this transition, given the legal and financial considerations that may be required. Eight common principles that define the child neurologist's role in a successful transition process have been outlined by a multidisciplinary panel convened by the Child Neurology Foundation are introduced and described. The authors of this consensus statement recognize the current paucity of evidence for successful transition models and outline areas for future consideration.

Histone arginine methylation in cocaine action in the nucleus accumbens	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						histone arginine (R) methylation; drug addiction; medium spiny neurons; ChIP-seq; Src	INDUCED PLASTICITY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; DELTA-FOSB; INHIBITION; ADDICTION; REVEALS; PRMT6; FAMILY; H3K4; H3R2	Repeated cocaine exposure regulates transcriptional regulation within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and epigenetic mechanisms-such as histone acetylation and methylation on Lys residues-have been linked to these lasting actions of cocaine. In contrast to Lysmethylation, the role of histone Arg (R) methylation remains underexplored in addictionmodels. Here we show that protein-R-methyltransferase-6 (PRMT6) and its associated histone mark, asymmetric dimethylation of R2 on histone H3 (H3R2me2a), are decreased in the NAc of mice and rats after repeated cocaine exposure, including self-administration, and in the NAc of cocaine-addicted humans. Such PRMT6 down-regulation occurs selectively in NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing dopamine D2 receptors (D2-MSNs), with opposite regulation occurring in D1-MSNs, and serves to protect against cocaine-induced addictive-like behavioral abnormalities. Using ChIP-seq, we identified Src kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (Srcin1; also referred to as p140Cap) as a key gene target for reduced H3R2me2a binding, and found that consequent Srcin1 induction in the NAc decreases Src signaling, cocaine reward, and the motivation to self-administer cocaine. Taken together, these findings suggest that suppression of Src signaling in NAc D2-MSNs, via PRMT6 and H3R2me2a down-regulation, functions as a homeostatic brake to restrain cocaine action, and provide novel candidates for the development of treatments for cocaine addiction.

In the diseased brain, classic intraneuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies contain abnormal formations of asyn protein which is mostly phosphorylated at serine 129 (pS129 asyn). This suggests that post-translational modifications may play a role in the pathogenic process. To date, several uniplex assays have been developed in order to quantify asyn not only in the brain but also in cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples in order to correlate asyn levels to disease severity and progression. Notably, only four assays have been established to measure pS129 asyn specifically and none provide simultaneous readout of the total and pS129 species. Therefore, we developed a sensitive high-throughput duplex assay quantifying total and pS129 human asyn (h-asyn) in the same well hence improving accuracy as well as saving time, consumables and samples. Results: Using our newly established duplex assay we measured total and pS129 h-asyn in vitro showing that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) can phosphorylate asyn up to 41 % in HEK293 cells and in vivo the same kinase phosphorylated h-asyn up to 17 % in rat ventral midbrain neurons. Interestingly, no increase in phosphorylation was observed when PLK2 and h-asyn were co-expressed in rat striatal neurons. Furthermore, using this assay we investigated h-asyn levels in brain tissue samples from patients with PD as well as PD dementia and found significant differences in pS129 h-asyn levels not only between disease tissue and healthy control samples but also between the two distinct disease states especially in hippocampal tissue samples. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that our duplex assay for simultaneous quantification is a useful tool to study h-asyn phosphorylation events in biospecimens and will be helpful in studies investigating the precise causative link between post-translational modification of h-asyn and PD pathology.

J	Li, T; Paudel, HK				Li, Tong; Paudel, Hemant K.			14-3-3 zeta Mediates Tau Aggregation in Human Neuroblastoma M17 Cells	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3-BETA; PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; HEK-293 CELLS; IN-VITRO; PHOSPHORYLATION; BRAIN	Microtubule-associated protein tau is the major component of paired helical filaments (PHFs) associated with the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau in the normal brain binds and stabilizes microtubules. Tau isolated from PHFs is hyperphosphorylated, which prevents it from binding to microtubules. Tau phosphorylation has been suggested to be involved in the development of NFT pathology in the AD brain. Recently, we showed that 14-3-3 zeta is bound to tau in the PHFs and when incubated in vitro with 14-3-3 zeta, tau formed amorphous aggregates, single-stranded straight filaments, double stranded ribbon-like filaments and PHF-like filaments that displayed close resemblance with corresponding ultra-structures of AD brain. Surprisingly however, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tau aggregated in a similar manner, indicating that tau phosphorylation does not affect in vitro tau aggregation (Qureshi et al (2013) Biochemistry 52, 6445-6455). In this study, we have examined the role of tau phosphorylation in tau aggregation in cellular level. We have found that in human M17 neuroblastoma cells, tau phosphorylation by GSK3 beta or PKA does not cause tau aggregation, but promotes 14-3-3 zeta-induced tau aggregation by destabilizing microtubules. Microtubule disrupting drugs also promoted 14-3-3 zeta-induced tau aggregation without changing tau phosphorylation in M17 cell. In vitro, when incubated with 14-3-3 zeta and microtubules, nonphosphorylated tau bound to microtubules and did not aggregate. Phosphorylated tau on the other hand did not bind to microtubules and aggregated. Our data indicate that microtubule-bound tau is resistant to 14-3-3 zeta-induced tau aggregation and suggest that tau phosphorylation promotes tau aggregation in the brain by detaching tau from microtubules and thus making it accessible to 14-3-3 zeta.

The Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group conducted the first randomized phase III, CCC-specific clinical trial that compared irinotecan and cisplatin (CPT-P) with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (TC) in patients with CCC. Patients and Methods Six hundred sixty-seven patients with stage I to IV CCC of the ovary were randomly assigned to receive irinotecan 60 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 plus cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1 (CPT-P group) every 4 weeks for six cycles or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 plus carboplatin area under the curve 6.0mg/mL/min on day 1 every 3 weeks for six cycles (TC group). The primary end point was progression free survival. Secondary end points were overall survival, overall response rate, and adverse events. Results Six hundred nineteen patients were clinically and pathologically eligible for evaluation. With a median follow-up of 44.3 months, 2-year progression-free survival rates were 73.0% in the CPT-P group and 77.6% in TC group (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.58; P = .85). Two-year overall survival rates were 85.5% with CPT-P and 87.4% with TC (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.61; one-sided P = .76). Grade 3/4 anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and febrile neutropenia occurred more frequently with CPT-P, whereas grade 3/4 leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and joint pain occurred more frequently with TC. Conclusion No significant survival benefit was found for CPT- P. Both regimens were well tolerated, but the toxicity profiles differed significantly. Treatment with existing anticancer agents has limitations to improving the prognosis of CCC.

In order to explore the engineering potential of the VS ribozyme to cleave alternate substrates, we substituted the wild-type KLI by other known KLIs using an innovative engineering method that combines rational and combinatorial approaches. A bioinformatic search of the protein data bank was initially performed to identify KLIs that are structurally similar to the one found in the VS ribozyme. Next, substrate/ribozyme (S/R) pairs that incorporate these alternative KLIs were kinetically and structurally characterized. Interestingly, several of the resulting S/R pairs allowed substrate cleavage with substantial catalytic efficiency, although with reduced activity compared to the reference S/R pair. Overall, this study describes an innovative approach for RNA engineering and establishes that the KLI of the trans VS ribozyme can be adapted to cleave other folded RNA substrates.

Differential Dendritic Integration of Synaptic Potentials and Calcium in Cerebellar Interneurons	NEURON			English	Article							CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; GRANULE CELLS; BASAL DENDRITES; PARALLEL FIBER; IN-VIVO; ACTIVE DENDRITES; SODIUM-CHANNELS; THIN DENDRITES; PURKINJE-CELL; PLASTICITY	Dendritic voltage integration determines the transformation of synaptic inputs into output firing, while synaptic calcium integration drives plasticity mechanisms thought to underlie memory storage. Dendritic calcium integration has been shown to follow the same synaptic input-output relationship as dendritic voltage, but whether similar operations apply to neurons exhibiting sublinear voltage integration is unknown. We examined the properties and cellular mechanisms of these dendritic operations in cerebellar molecular layer interneurons using dendritic voltage and calcium imaging, in combination with synaptic stimulation or glutamate uncaging. We show that, while synaptic potentials summate sublinearly, concomitant dendritic calcium signals summate either linearly or supralinearly depending on the number of synapses activated. The supralinear dendritic calcium triggers a branch-specific, short-term suppression of neurotransmitter release that alters the pattern of synaptic activation. Thus, differential voltage and calcium integration permits dynamic regulation of neuronal input-output transformations without altering intrinsic nonlinear integration mechanisms.

The Masking Level Difference (MLD) test was administered on healthy individuals over three sessions: before (I) and after 90 min of visual deprivation (II), and after 90 min of re-exposure to light (III). A non-deprived control group performed the same tests, but remained sighted between sessions I and II. The non-deprived control group displayed constant results across sessions. However, performance in the MLD test was improved following short-term visual deprivation and performance returned to pre-deprivation values after light re-exposure. This study finds that short-term visual deprivation transiently enhances the spatial release from masking. These data suggest the significant potential for enhancing a process involved in the cocktail party effect in normally developing individuals and adds to an emerging literature on the potential to enhance auditory ability after only a brief period of visual deprivation.

We mapped its distribution using in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) combined with light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM) in adult rat and mouse brain. The strongest ISH signal was in the hippocampal pyramidal and granule cell layers. Moderate levels were detected in habenula, striatum, amygdala, the cingulate, piriform and entorhinal cortex, and in cerebellum, notably the Purkinje cell layer. The IHC signal distribution was consistent with ISH results, with transport of the protein to processes, as exemplified in the hippocampal neuropil layers and weakly stained pyramidal cell layers. In contrast, in the cerebellum, the Purkinje cell bodies were the most strongly immunolabeled elements. EM localized the cell surface-expression of EphA7 essentially in postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of dendritic spines and shafts, and on some astrocytic leaflets, in both hippocampus and cerebellum. Perikaryal and dendritic labeling was mostly intracellular, associated with the synthetic and trafficking machineries. Immunopositive vesicles were also observed in axons and axon terminals. Quantitative analysis in EM showed significant differences in the frequency of labeled elements between regions. Notably, labeled dendrites were similar to 3-5 times less frequent in cerebellum than in hippocampus, but they were individually endowed with similar to 10-40 times higher frequencies of PSDs, on their shafts and spines. The cell surface localization of EphA7, being preferentially in PSDs, and in perisynaptic astrocytic leaflets, provides morphologic evidence that EphA7 plays key roles in adult CNS synaptic maintenance, plasticity, or function.

However, it is unclear whether selective semantic retrieval relies exclusively on general control mechanisms recruited in demanding non-semantic tasks, or instead on systems specialised for the control of meaning. One hypothesis is that the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) is important in the controlled retrieval of semantic (not non-semantic) information; however this view remains controversial since a parallel literature links this site to event and relational semantics. In a functional neuroimaging study, we demonstrated that an area of pMTG implicated in semantic control by a recent meta-analysis was activated in a conjunction of (i) semantic association over size judgements and (ii) action over colour feature matching. Under these circumstances the same region showed functional coupling with the inferior frontal gyrus - another crucial site for semantic control. Structural and functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that this site is at the nexus of networks recruited in automatic semantic processing (the default mode network) and executively demanding tasks (the multiple-demand network). Moreover, in both task and task-free contexts, pMTG exhibited functional properties that were more similar to ventral parts of inferior frontal cortex, implicated in controlled semantic retrieval, than more dorsal inferior frontal sulcus, implicated in domain-general control. Finally, the pMTG region was functionally correlated at rest with other regions implicated in control-demanding semantic tasks, including inferior frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus. We suggest that pMTG may play a crucial role within a large-scale network that allows the integration of automatic retrieval in the default mode network with executively demanding goal-oriented cognition, and that this could support our ability to understand actions and nondominant semantic associations, allowing semantic retrieval to be 'shaped' to suit a task or context.
