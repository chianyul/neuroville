High frequency oscillations (HFOs-ripples, 80-250 Hz; fast ripples, 250-500 Hz) are linked to seizure onset. This study investigates whether interictal HFOs are more frequent in areas with a low threshold to provoke ADs or seizures. Methods: Intracranial EEG studies were filtered at 500 Hz and sampled at 2,000 Hz. HFOs were visually identified. Twenty patients underwent ES, with gradually increasing currents. Results were interpreted as agreeing or disagreeing with the intracranial study (clinical-EEG seizure onset defined the SOZ). Current thresholds provoking an AD or seizure were correlated with the rate of HFOs of each channel. Results: ES provoked a seizure in 12 and ADs in 19 patients. Sixteen patients showed an ES response inside the SOZ, and 10 had additional areas with ADs. The response was more specific for mesiotemporal than for neocortical channels. HFO rates were negatively correlated with thresholds for ES responses; especially in neocortical regions; areas with low threshold and high HFO rate were colocalized even outside the SOZ. Discussion: Areas showing epileptic HFOs colocalize with those reacting to ES. HFOs may represent a pathologic correlate of regions showing an ES response; both phenomena suggest a more widespread epileptogenicity.

In the present paper, the support vector machines (SVM) are used to develop quantitative relationships between the anti-HIV activity and four molecular descriptors of 82 TIBO derivatives. The results obtained by SVM give good statistical results compared to those given by multiple linear regressions and artificial neural networks. The contribution of each descriptor to structure-activity relationships was evaluated. It indicates the importance of the hydrophobic parameter. The proposed method can be successfully used to predict the anti-HIV of TIBO derivatives with only four molecular descriptors which can be calculated directly from molecular structure alone.

Unbiased counts of SERT+ axon varicosities revealed an average density of 5-HT innervation higher in monkeys (1.52 x 106 varicosities/mm3) than rats (1.17 x 106), particularly in the anterior half of the nucleus (1.70 x 106). As measured by electron microscopy, SERT+ axon varicosity profiles in the STN of both species were smaller than unlabeled profiles. The number of SERT+ profiles displaying a synaptic junction indicated that, in both rat and monkey STN, approximately half of 5-HT axon varicosities were asynaptic. In monkeys, all synaptic junctions made by SERT+ varicosities were asymmetrical, as opposed to only 77% in rats. Despite the higher density of 5-HT innervation in the anterior half of monkey STN, the ultrastructural features of its SERT+ varicosities, including synaptic incidence, did not significantly differ from those in its posterior half. These findings suggest that, throughout the rat and monkey STN, 5-HT afferents may exert their influence via both synaptic delivery and diffusion of 5-HT, and that an ambient level of 5-HT maintained in STN by these two modes of transmission might also modulate neuronal activity and influence motor behavior. A better understanding of the factors governing the complex interplay between these signaling processes would greatly improve our knowledge of the physiopathology of the STN.

However, febrile seizures in children with dysgenesis have been associated with the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. We have previously shown in a rat model of dysgenesis (cortical freeze lesion) and hyperthermia-induced seizures that 86% of these animals developed recurrent seizures in adulthood. The cellular changes underlying the increased risk of epileptogenesis in this model are not known. Using whole cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, we found a more pronounced increase in excitability in rats with both hyperthermic seizures and dysgenesis than in rats with hyperthermic seizures alone or dysgenesis alone. The change was found to be secondary to an increase in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Inversely, hyperpolarization-activated cation current was more pronounced in naive rats with hyperthermic seizures than in rats with dysgenesis and hyperthermic seizures or with dysgenesis alone. The increase in GABA(A)-mediated inhibition observed was comparable in rats with or without dysgenesis after hyperthermic seizures, whereas no changes were observed in rats with dysgenesis alone. Our work indicates that in this two-hit model, changes in NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs may facilitate epileptogenesis following febrile seizures. Changes in the hyperpolarization-activated cation currents may represent a protective reaction and act by damping the NMDA receptor-mediated hyperexcitability, rather than converting inhibition into excitation. These findings provide a new hypothesis of cellular changes following hyperthermic seizures in predisposed individuals, and may help in the design of therapeutic strategies to prevent epileptogenesis following prolonged febrile seizures.

However, it has been proposed that extinction given immediately after conditioning reflects memory 'erasure'. Using contextual fear conditioning, we examine the nature of extinction further using a novel behavioral paradigm that probes for the absence or presence of a memory. Rats received a context paired with one of three different shock intensities (0.8, 1.2 or 1.6 mA) and then received extinction either immediately (15 min) or after a delay (24 h). Spontaneous recovery was roughly equivalent in the immediate and delayed extinction groups when they were tested at 24 h after extinction. To further test the status of the original memory trace, we exploited the effect that only the first, but not second, learning of contextual fear requires N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDArs) in the dorsal hippocampus [M.J. Sanders & M.S. Fanselow (2003) Neurobiology of Learning and Memory80,123-129]. Here we use this property of second learning to determine if memory of an immediately extinguished fear also persists. Rats received bilateral infusions of the NMDAr antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid into the dorsal hippocampus prior to training in a novel second context. Memory for the second learning is not affected by NMDAr blockade in either group, suggesting that the extinguished memory is not erased but inhibited. Overall, the results provide little evidence that extinction conducted immediately after conditioning destroys or erases the original memory trace.	[Archbold, Georgina E.

The aim of this study was to develop an integrated neurophysiological approach linking central and peripheral markers of nervous activity during the presentation of natural scenes in order to determine the temporal stages of brain processing related to the bodily impact of emotions. More specifically, whole head magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data and skin conductance response (SCR), a reliable autonomic marker of central activation, were recorded in healthy volunteers during the presentation of emotional (unpleasant and pleasant) and neutral pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Analyses of event-related magnetic fields (ERFs) revealed greater activity at 180 ms in an occipitotemporal component for emotional pictures than for neutral counterparts. More importantly, these early effects of emotional arousal on cerebral activity were significantly correlated with later increases in SCR magnitude. For the first time, a neuromagnetic cortical component linked to a well-documented marker of bodily arousal expression of emotion, namely, the SCR, was identified and located. This finding sheds light on the time course of the brain-body interaction with emotional arousal and provides new insights into the neural bases of complex and reciprocal mind-body links.

It was first shown in mammals that this reflex could be organized by a sympathetic ganglion, the coeliac plexus. The excitation of gastric mechanosensitive fibres leads in this ganglion to the release of a neurotransmitter, which in turn activates ganglionic neurones leading to inhibition of the duodenum contractions. It rapidly became apparent that this reflex presented striking properties since it was organized in the absence of action potentials along the nerve fibres. Then it was shown that the neurotransmitter released in the coeliac plexus was gaseous: nitric oxide (NO). The nature of the mechanism conducting, without action potentials, the excitation along the nerve fibres was recently determined. This mechanism necessitates the integrity of particular areas of the neuronal membrane (the lipid rafts) and the activation in cascade of the following second messenger sequence: ceramide, calcium, NO and guanosine cyclic monophosphate (c-GMP). These results show how studies in biological gastroenterology have led to the rethinking of one of the central dogmas in neuroscience according to which excitation is only conducted along the nerves by the action potential.

Based on catecholamine urinary excretion, mass screening (MS) programmes have been organized but failed to decrease the mortality of this tumour. To test the hypotheses of a spontaneous maturation/differentiation or regression, the levels of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1, an early apoptosis marker, of PhosphoAKT, a major apoptosis inhibitor, and of maturation/differentiation were compared in standard and in MS neuroblastomas. Methods and results: We performed a case-control study of 55 primary tumours and 21 metastases of MS neuroblastomas. Matched controls were standard unscreened neuroblastomas and were paired according to age, stage, and MYCN amplification. The tumours were included in tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against, AKT, phosphoAKT, TRKB and PARP-1. The expression of PARP-1 and that of phosphoAKT were significantly higher in standard than in MS neuroblastomas independently of age and stage of the tumour. PhosphoAKT and PARP-1 expression was significantly correlated in both tumours. Conclusions: These data suggest that the better prognosis of patients with MS neuroblastomas compared with classical neuroblastomas was secondary to spontaneous tumour regression mediated by higher levels of apoptosis associated with low activation of AKT.

Individuals with autism demonstrate atypical social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors, but can also present enhanced abilities, particularly in auditory and visual perception and nonverbal reasoning. Structural brain differences have been reported in autism, in terms of increased total brain volume (particularly in young children with autism), and regional gray/white matter differences in both adults and children with autism, but the reports are inconsistent [Amaral et al. (2008): Trends Neurosci 31:137-145]. These inconsistencies may be due to differences in diagnostic/inclusion criteria, and age and Intelligence Quotient of participants. Here, for the first time, we used two complementary magnetic resonance imaging techniques, cortical thickness analyses, and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), to investigate the neuroanatomical differences between a homogenous group of young adults with autism of average intelligence but delayed or atypical language development (often referred to as "high-functioning autism"), relative to a closely matched group of typically developing controls. The cortical thickness and VBM techniques both revealed regional structural brain differences (mostly in terms of gray matter increases) in brain areas implicated in social cognition, communication, and repetitive behaviors, and thus in each of the core atypical features of autism. Gray matter increases were also found in auditory and visual primary and associative perceptual areas. We interpret these results as the first structural brain correlates of atypical auditory and visual perception in autism, in support of the enhanced perceptual functioning model [Mottron et al.

Optic pathway gliomas in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1: Follow-up of 44 patients	JOURNAL OF AAPOS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Low Vision	JUL, 2008	Montreal, CANADA				CHILDREN; TUMORS	BACKGROUND Children born with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) during childhood. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical course of NF1 patients with OPGs at our institution with respect to visual and endocrinologic morbidity. METHODS Retrospective case series of patients with OPGs and NF1 seen at the Montreal Children's Hospital, where screening imaging is performed on all NF1 patients. Details on patient demographics, tumor location, and progression of disease were recorded. RESULTS Of 331 NF1 patient charts reviewed, 44 had confirmed OPG (13%). Average follow-up was 7 years. Mean age at presentation was 6 years, with 16 patients (36%) presenting past age 6. A total of 8 patients were symptomatic secondary to the OPG (defined as decreased vision or precocious puberty), with 5 of the 8 patients receiving treatment. These 8 patients all demonstrated chiasmal and/or retrochiasmal tumor in addition to nerve involvement. Final visual acuity was 20/40 or better in both eyes in 34 patients (77%); central, steady, and maintained in 3 preverbal children; and decreased vision secondary to OPG in 4 children (9%). CONCLUSIONS OPGs can present and progress beyond the preschool years, and children should be screened with clinical ophthalmological examinations accordingly. The location of OPG as demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot be used as a prognostic indicator because visual outcomes were similar between optic nerve/chiasmal and retrochiasmal tumors.

A high-fat diet increases risk of ventricular arrhythmia in female rats: enhanced arrhythmic risk in the absence of obesity or hyperlipidemia. J Appl Physiol 108: 933-940, 2010. First published February 4, 2010; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.01281.2009.-Obesity increases the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and impairs wound healing. However, it is presently unknown whether a high-fat diet affects arrhythmic risk or wound healing before the onset of overt obesity or hyperlipidemia. After 8 wk of feeding a high-fat diet to adult female rats, a nonsignificant increase in body weight was observed and associated with a normal plasma lipid profile. Following ischemia/reperfusion injury, scar length (standard diet 0.29 +/- 0.09 vs. high-fat 0.32 +/- 0.13 cm), thickness (standard diet 0.047 +/- 0.02 vs. high-fat 0.059 +/- 0.01 cm), and collagen alpha(1) type 1 content (standard diet 0.21 +/- 0.04 vs. high-fat 0.20 +/- 0.04 arbitrary units/mm(2)) of infarcted hearts were not altered by the high-fat diet. However, the mortality rate was greatly increased 24 h postinfarction (from 5% to 46%, P < 0.01 for ischemia/reperfusion rats; from 20% to 89%, P < 0.0001, in complete-occlusion rats) in high-fat fed rats, in association with a higher prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmia inducibility was also significantly increased in noninfarcted rats fed a high-fat diet. In the hearts of rats fed a high-fat diet, connexin-40 expression was absent, connexin-43 was hypophosphorylated and lateralized, and neurofilament-M immunoreactive fiber density (standard diet 2,020 +/- 260 vs. high-fat diet 2,830 +/- 250 mu m(2)/mm(2)) and tyrosine hydroxylase protein expression were increased (P < 0.05). Thus, in the absence of overt obesity and hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperinnervation and an aberrant pattern of gap junctional protein expression and regulation in the heart of female rats fed a high-fat diet may have contributed in part to the higher incidence of inducible cardiac arrhythmias.

Developmental origins of disruptive behaviour problems: the 'original sin' hypothesis, epigenetics and their consequences for prevention	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Disruptive behaviour; developmental origins; epigenetics; prevention; developmental trajectories; aggression; opposition; stealing; vandalism; rule breaking; defiance	ANTISOCIAL CONDUCT PROBLEMS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; 15-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; PHYSICAL AGGRESSION; MATERNAL-CARE; OPPOSITIONAL-DEFIANT; EXTERNALIZING BEHAVIOR; PROACTIVE AGGRESSION; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE; DRD4 POLYMORPHISM	This paper reviews publications on developmental trajectories of disruptive behaviour (DB) problems (aggression, opposition-defiance, rule breaking, and stealing-vandalism) over the past decade. Prior to these studies two theoretical models had strongly influenced research on DB: social learning and disease onset. According to these developmental perspectives, children learn DB from their environment and onset of the disease is triggered by accumulated exposition to disruptive models in the environment, including the media. Most of the evidence came from studies of school age children and adolescents. Longitudinal studies tracing developmental trajectories of DB from early childhood onwards suggest an inversed developmental process. DB are universal during early childhood. With age, children learn socially acceptable behaviours from interactions with their environment. A 'disease' status is given to children who fail to learn the socially acceptable behaviours. The mechanisms that lead to deficits in using socially accepted behaviours are strongly intergenerational, based on complex genetic and environmental contributions, including epigenetic mechanisms. Prevention of these deficits requires early, intensive and long-term support to parents and child. Newly discovered epigenetic mechanisms suggest that intensive perinatal interventions will have impacts on numerous aspects of physical and mental health, including DB. This review also concludes that: a) subtypes of disruptive behaviours should not be aggregated because they have different developmental trajectories and require specific corrective interventions; b) the overt-covert and destructive-nondestructive dimensions appear the most useful to create DB subtypes; c) overt DB onset before covert DB because the latter require more brain maturation; d) DB subtype taxonomies are more useful for clinicians than developmental taxonomies because the latter are post mortem diagnoses and clinicians' retrospective information is unreliable; e) we need large-scale collaborative preventive experimental interventions starting during early pregnancy to advance knowledge on causes and prevention of DB problems.

Blindsight Mediated by an S-Cone-independent Collicular Pathway: An fMRI Study in Hemispherectomized Subjects	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; DETECTION MECHANISMS; RESIDUAL VISION; COLOR-VISION; SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SPATIAL SUMMATION; CONTRAST SPACE; VISUAL-CORTEX; RED-GREEN	The purpose of our study was to investigate the ability to process achromatic and short-wavelength-sensitive cone (S-cone)-isolating (blue-yellow) stimuli in the blind visual field of hemispherectomized subjects and to demonstrate that blind-sight is mediated by a collicular pathway that is independent of S-cone inputs. Blindsight has been described as the ability to respond to visual stimuli in the blind visual field without conscious awareness [Weiskrantz, L., Warrington, E. K., Sanders, M. D., & Marshall, J. Visual capacity in the hemianopic field following a restricted occipital ablation. Brain, 97, 709-728, 1974]. The roles of the subcortical neural structures in blindsight, such as the pulvinar and the superior colliculus, have been debated and an underlying neural correlate has yet to be confirmed. Using fMRI, we tested the ability to process visual stimuli that isolated the achromatic and short-wavelength-sensitive (S-)-cone pathways in three subjects: one control subject, one hemispher-ectomized subject with blindsight, and one hemispherectomized subject without blindsight. We demonstrated that (1) achromatic and S-cone-isolating stimuli presented to the normal visual hemifield of hemispherectomized subjects and to both visual hemifields of the control subject activated contralateral visual areas (V1/V2), as expected; (2) achromatic stimulus presentation but not S-cone-isolating stimulus presentation to the blind hemifield of the subject with blindsight activated visual areas FEF/V5; (3) whereas the cortical activation of the control subject was enhanced by an additional stimulus (achromatic and S-cone isolating) presented in the contralateral visual field, activation pattern of the subject with blindsight was enhanced by achromatic stimuli only. We conclude that the human superior colliculus is blind to the S-cone-isolating stimuli, and blindsight is mediated by an S-cone-independent collicular pathway.

Musicians were presented with the first few notes of a familiar tune (Experiment 1) or its title (Experiment 2), followed by a string of notes that was either an exact or an inexact reversal. The task was to judge whether the second string was correct or not by mentally reversing all its notes, thus requiring both maintenance and manipulation of the represented string. Both experiments showed considerable activation of the superior parietal lobe (intraparietal sulcus) during the reversal process. Ventrolateral and dorsolateral frontal cortices were also activated, consistent with the memory load required during the task. We also found weaker evidence for some activation of right auditory cortex in both studies, congruent with results from previous simpler music imagery tasks. We interpret these results in the context of other mental transformation tasks, such as mental rotation in the visual domain, which are known to recruit the intraparietal sulcus region, and we propose that this region sub-serves general computations that require transformations of a sensory input. Mental imagery tasks may thus have both task or modality-specific components as well as components that supersede any specific codes and instead represent amodal mental manipulation.

Previous studies of RP have focused on repetition suppression as the basis of behavioral facilitation, primarily using word and object identification and classification tasks. More recently, researchers have suggested associative stimulus-response learning as an alternate model for behavioral facilitation. We examined the neural basis of RP during mathematical problem solving in the context of these two models of learning. Brain imaging and behavioral data were acquired from 39 adults during novel and repeated presentation of three-operand mathematical equations. Despite widespread decreases in activation during repeat, compared with novel trials, there was no direct relation between behavioral facilitation and the degree of repetition suppression in any brain region. Rather, RT improvements were directly correlated with repetition enhancement in the hippocampus and the posteromedial cortex [posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and retro-splenial cortex; Brodmann's areas (BAs) 23, 7, and 30, respectively], regions known to support memory formation and retrieval, and in the SMA (BA 6) and the dorsal midcingulate ("motor cingulate") cortex (BA 24d), regions known to be important for motor learning. Furthermore, improvements in RT were also correlated with increased functional connectivity of the hippocampus with both the SMA and the dorsal midcingulate cortex. Our findings provide novel support for the hypothesis that repetition enhancement and associated stimulus-response learning may facilitate behavioral performance during problem solving.

The structure and size of sensory bursts encode stimulus information but only size affects behavior	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sensory coding; Ultrasound avoidance; Bursting; Temporal coding; Cricket	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INTERSPIKE INTERVALS; NEURONS; SPIKES; SYSTEM	Cricket ultrasound avoidance is a classic model system for neuroethology. Avoidance steering is triggered by high-firing-rate bursts of spikes in the auditory command neuron AN2. Although bursting is common among sensory neurons, and although the detailed structure of bursts may encode information about the stimulus, it is as yet unclear whether this information is decoded. We address this question in two ways: from an information coding point of view, by showing the relationship between stimulus and burst structure; and also from a functional point of view by showing the relationship between burst structure and behavior. We conclude that the burst structure carries detailed temporal information about the stimulus but that this has little impact on the behavioral response, which is affected mainly by burst size.

This defect results in mitochondrial iron-overload, and in this review, we discuss the mechanisms that lead to this iron accumulation. Using a conditional knockout mouse model where frataxin is deleted in the heart, it has been shown that this mutation leads to transferrin receptor-1 upregulation, resulting in increased iron uptake from transferrin. There is also marked downregulation of ferritin that is required for iron storage and decreased expression of the iron exporter, ferroportin1, leading to decreased cellular iron efflux. The increased mitochondrial iron uptake is facilitated by upregulation of the mitochondrial iron transporter, mitoferrin2. This stimulation of iron uptake probably attempts to rescue the deficit in mitochondrial iron metabolism that is due to downregulation of mitochondrial iron utilization, namely, heme and iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) synthesis and also iron storage (mitochondrial ferritin). The resultant decrease in heme and ISC synthesis means heme and ISCs are not exiting the mitochondrion for cytosolic use. Hence, increased mitochondrial iron uptake coupled with decreased utilization and release leads to mitochondrial iron-loading. More generally, disturbance of mitochondrial iron utilization in other diseases probably also results in similar compensatory alterations.

It regulates synaptic plasticity by acting as a binding partner for glial ephrin-A3 and possibly other pre- or post-synaptic ephrins. Now, its trafficking mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we examine the association of EphA4 with transport, clathrin-coated and synaptic vesicles using cell fractionation, vesicle immunoisolation and electron microscopy. EphA4 was found in highly purified fractions of clathrin-coated or synaptic vesicles. It was also detected in vesicles immuno-isolated with antibodies anti-synaptophysin, anti-vesicular glutamate transporter or anti-vesicular GABA transporter; demonstrating its presence in synaptic vesicles. However, it was not detected in immuno-isolated piccolo-bassoon transport vesicles. In vivo and in dissociated cultures, EphA4 was localized by immunoelectron microscopy in vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive terminals of hippocampal neurons. Remarkably, the cell surface immunofluorescence of EphA4 increased markedly in cultured hippocampal neurons following KCl depolarization. These observations indicate that EphA4 is present in subsets of synaptic vesicles, can be externalized during depolarization, and internalized within clathrin-coated vesicles. This trafficking itinerary may serve to regulate the levels of EphA4 in the synaptic plasma membrane and thereby modulate signaling events that contribute to synaptic plasticity.

This study aims to help delineate pregabalin's anti-hyperalgesic mechanisms. We assessed the effectiveness of pregabalin at decreasing mechanical and cold hypersensitivity induced in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Thus, we compared the effectiveness of pre- or post-treatment with systemic or intrathecal (i.t.) pregabalin at reducing the development and maintenance of the neuropathic pain symptoms. Pregabalin successfully decreased mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, as a pretreatment, but was less effective at suppressing cold hypersensitivity when administered as a post-treatment. Furthermore, both i.t. and systemic administration of pregabalin were effective in reducing the behavioral hypersensitivity, with the exception of systemic post-treatment on cold hypersensitivity. We also examined pregabalin's effects at inhibiting hind paw formalin-induced nociception in naive rats and formalin-induced release of excitatory amino acids in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) both in naive rats and in rats with neuropathic pain. Pregabalin dose-dependently reduced nociceptive scores in the formalin test. We also present the first evidence that pregabalin reduces the formalin-induced release of glutamate in SCDH. Furthermore, i.t. pregabalin reduces the enhanced noxious stimulus-induced spinal release of glutamate seen in neuropathic rats. These data suggest that pregabalin reduces neuropathic pain symptoms by inhibiting the release of glutamate in the SCDH.

Activity-dependent layer-specific changes in the extracellular chloride concentration and chloride driving force in the rat hippocampus. J Neurophysiol 103: 1905-1914, 2010. First published February 3, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00497.2009. The transmembrane distribution of chloride anions (Cl(-)) determines the direction of the Cl(-) flux through GAB(A) A receptors; this establishes whether GABA A receptor-mediated responses are hyperpolarizing or depolarizing in neurons. Thus an activity-dependent reduction in the efficacy of inhibitory responses can be the result of an activity-induced reduction of the Cl(-) driving force. Using Cl(-)-sensitive electrodes, we measured the extracellular Cl(-) concentration ([Cl(-)](o)) in each layer of the hippocampus under control conditions and after stimulation. In the control condition, [Cl(-)](o) was lower within the CA1 region (112.9 +/- 1.3 mM; mean +/- SD) than the CA3/dentate gyrus areas (117.7 +/- 1.2 mM). Stimulation of CA3 pyramidal cells led to an increase in the [Cl(-)](o). The maximum values were observed in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (253.4 +/- 51.1 mM) and in the hilus (261 +/- 43.7 mM), whereas in the granular cell layer, it reached only 159.5 +/- 41 mM. The stimulation-induced [Cl(-)](o) increase was followed by a period of decreasing [Cl(-)](o) that fell below the control values. The maximum undershoot (21.6 +/- 0.7 mM) was observed in the s. radiatum. Systemic application of the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone significantly decreased the stimulation-induced Cl(-) extrusion in the dentate gyrus but only slightly modified it in the CA1 area. Carbenoxolone also drastically reduced the Cl(-) clearance. The time constant of the Cl clearance was similar between layers (83.4 +/- 15.9 ms) but increased after carbenoxolone application (207.1 +/- 44.4ms). Stimulation-induced changes in the [Cl(-)](o) significantly decreased the Cl(-) driving force and resulted in large fluctuations between layers (Delta=9.4 mV). The lowest value was observed in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 and the hilar region (7.7 mV), whereas the highest value was calculated for the granule cell layer (16.3 mV). We suggest that a decrease of the extracellular space is mainly responsible for the rapid [Cl(-)](o) increase while the gap junction coupled astrocytic network plays a key role in the activity-dependent redistribution and clearance of Cl(-) across layers of the hippocampus.

Neurons in area 5 of the posterior parietal cortex in the cat contribute to interlimb coordination during visually guided locomotion: a role in working memory. J Neurophysiol 103: 2234-2254, 2010. First published February 17, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.01100.2009. We tested the hypothesis that area 5 of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) contributes to interlimb coordination in locomotor tasks requiring visual guidance by recording neuronal activity in this area in three cats in two locomotor paradigms. In the first paradigm, cats were required to step over obstacles attached to a moving treadmill belt. We recorded 47 neurons that discharged in relationship to the hindlimbs. Of these, 31/47 discharged between the passage of the fore- and hindlimbs (FL-HL cells) over the obstacle. The activity of most of these neurons (25/31) was related to the fore- and hindlimb contralateral to the recording site when the contralateral forelimb was the first to pass over the obstacle. In many cells, discharge activity was limb-independent in that it was better related to the ipsilateral limbs when they were the first to step over the obstacle. The other 16/47 neurons discharged only when the hindlimbs stepped over the obstacle with the majority of these (12/16) discharging between the passage of the two hindlimbs over the obstacle. We tested 15/47 cells, including 11/47 FL-HL cells, in a second paradigm in which cats stepped over an obstacle on a walkway. Discharge activity in all of these cells was significantly modulated when the cat stepped over the obstacle and remained modified for periods of <= 1 min when forward progress of the cat was delayed with either the fore- and hindlimbs, or the two hindlimbs, straddling the obstacle. We suggest that neurons in area 5 of the PPC contribute to interlimb coordination during locomotion by estimating the spatial and temporal attributes of the obstacle with respect to the body. We further suggest that the discharge observed both during the steps over the obstacle and in the delayed locomotor paradigm is a neuronal correlate of working memory.

However, synaptically induced plasticity of glia themselves remains ill defined. Here we used the amphibian neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to study plasticity of perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), glial cells at this synapse, following long-term in vivo modifications of synaptic activity. We used two models that altered synaptic activity in different manners. First, chronic blockade of postsynaptic nicotinic receptors using alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTx) decreased facilitation, increased synaptic depression and decreased post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). Second, chronic nerve stimulation increased facilitation and resistance to synaptic depression, while leaving PTP unaltered. Our results indicate that there is no direct relationship between transmitter release and PSC calcium responses. Indeed, despite changes in transmitter release and plasticity in stimulated NMJs, nerve-evoked PSC calcium responses were similar to control. Similarly, PSC calcium responses in alpha-BTx treated NMJs were delayed and smaller in amplitude, even though basal level of transmitter release was increased. Also, when isolating purinergic and muscarinic components of PSC calcium responses, we found an increased sensitivity to ATP and a decreased sensitivity to muscarine in chronically stimulated NMJs. Conversely, in alpha-BTx treated NMJs, PSC sensitivity remained unaffected, but ATP- and muscarine-induced calcium responses were prolonged. Thus, our results reveal complex modifications of PSC properties, with differential modulation of signalling pathways that might underlie receptor regulation or changes in Ca2+ handling. Importantly, similar to neurons, perisynaptic glial cells undergo plastic changes induced by altered synaptic activity.

Abnormal VGSC activity is central to the pathophysiology of epileptic seizures, and many of the most widely used antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, are inhibitors of VGSC function. These antiepileptic drugs might also be efficacious in the treatment of other nervous system disorders, such as migraine, multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuropathic pain. In this Review, we summarise the structure and function of VGSCs and their involvement in the pathophysiology of several neurological disorders. We also describe the biophysical and molecular bases for the mechanisms of action of antiepileptic VGSC blockers and discuss the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of epileptic and non-epileptic disorders. Overall, clinical and experimental data indicate that these drugs are efficacious for a range of diseases, and that the development of drugs with enhanced selectivity for specific VGSC isoforms might be an effective and novel approach for the treatment of several neurological diseases.

The relative abundance of dinocyst taxa and principal component analysis show a major transition at about 300 cal. years BP. It is characterized by the disappearance of thermophilic taxa Spiniferites mirabilis-hyperacanthus and Impagidinium sphaericum and the increase of polar-subpolar taxa Impagidinium pallidum and Pentapharsodinium dalei. Sea-surface temperature (SST) estimates suggest warmer conditions than present (anomaly similar to+2 degrees C) averaging at 7 degrees C in summer until 300 cal. years BP, although cooling pulses are recorded around 1700. 1500, 1200 and 800 cal. years BR The last 300 years were marked by a cooling from 7.6 to 3.5 degrees C and sea-ice cover increasing up to 7 months/yr. The results demonstrate that the Fram Strait area is sensitive to hydroclimatic variations, notably with respect to sea-ice and SSTs, which are linked to the relative strength of northward flow of North Atlantic waters to the East and southward outflow of cold and fresh waters from the Arctic Ocean. Based on our data, the warmest part of our record around 1320 cal. years BP is the only interval of the last 2500 years that provides a possible analogue for the modern post-AD 2000 interval, which is characterized by sea-ice free conditions.

The main concern is the existence of travelling wave front. By employing the speed index function, we are able to obtain the existence of a travelling wave front for each of these four types within certain range of model parameters. We are also able to describe how the feedback coupling strength and the magnitude of the delay affect the wave speed. Some particular kernel functions for these four cases are chosen to numerically demonstrate the theoretical results.

Preference is given to the neural network over other interpolation techniques for ore grade estimation because of its ability to learn any linear or non-linear relationship between inputs and outputs. In many cases, ensembles of neural networks have been shown, both theoretically and empirically, to outperform a single network. The performance of an ensemble model largely depends on the accuracy and diversity of member networks. In this study, techniques of a genetic algorithm (GA) and k-means clustering are used for the ensemble neural network modeling of a lead-zinc deposit. Two types of ensemble neural network modeling are investigated, a resampling-based neural ensemble and a parameter-based neural ensemble. The k-means clustering is used for selecting diversified ensemble members. The GA is used for improving accuracy by calculating ensemble weights. Results are compared with average ensemble, weighted ensemble, best individual networks, and ordinary kriging models. It is observed that the developed method works fairly well for predicting zinc grades, but shows no significant improvement in predicting lead grades. It is also observed that, while a resampling-based neural ensemble model performs better than the parameter-based neural ensemble model for predicting lead grades, the parameter-based ensemble model performs better for predicting zinc grades.

Louis			An automatic geometrical and statistical method to detect acoustic shadows in intraoperative ultrasound brain images	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						3D ultrasound; Acoustic shadows; Reconstruction; Registration	FREEHAND 3D ULTRASOUND; REGISTRATION	In ultrasound images, acoustic shadows appear as regions of low signal intensity linked to boundaries with very high acoustic impedance differences. Acoustic shadows can be viewed either as informative features to detect lesions or calcifications, or as damageable artifacts for image processing tasks such as segmentation, registration or 3D reconstruction. In both cases, the detection of these acoustic shadows is useful. This paper proposes a new method to detect these shadows that combines a geometrical approach to estimate the B-scans shape, followed by a statistical test based on a dedicated modeling of ultrasound image statistics. Results demonstrate that the combined geometrical-statistical technique is more robust and yields better results than the previous statistical technique. Integration of regularization over time further improves robustness. Application of the procedure results in (1) improved 3D reconstructions with fewer artifacts, and (2) reduced mean registration error of tracked intraoperative brain ultrasound images.

Cell-based therapies may provide a new strategy for bolstering regeneration and repair through neuro-axonal protection or remyelination. Mesenchymal stem cells modulate pathological responses in experimental autoimmune encephalitis, alleviating disease, but also stimulate repair of the central nervous system through the release of soluble factors. Autologous and allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been safely administered to individuals with hemato-oncological diseases and in a limited number of patients with multiple sclerosis. It is therefore reasonable to move mesenchymal stem cells transplantation into properly controlled human studies to explore their potential as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. Since it is likely that the first such studies will probably involve only small numbers of patients in a few centers, we formed an international panel comprising multiple sclerosis neurology and stem cell experts, as well as immunologists. The aims were to derive a consensus on the utilization of mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, along with protocols for the culture of the cells and the treatment of patients. This article reviews the consensus derived from our group on the rationale for mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, the methodology for generating mesenchymal stem cells and the first treatment protocol for multiple sclerosis patients.

Central clock excites vasopressin neurons by waking osmosensory afferents during late sleep	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VASCULOSUM LAMINA TERMINALIS; NUCLEUS IN-VITRO; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEUS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; GABA(B) RECEPTORS; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE; OSMOTIC STIMULATION; OXYTOCIN NEURONS; BRAIN SLICE	Osmoregulated vasopressin release is facilitated during the late sleep period (LSP) to prevent dehydration and enuresis. Previous work has shown that clock neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) have low firing rates during the LSP, but it is not known how this reduced activity enhances vasopressin release. We found that synaptic excitation of rat supraoptic nucleus neurons by osmosensory afferents is facilitated during the LSP. Stimulation of the SCN at this time inhibited excitatory synaptic currents induced in supraoptic neurons by activation of osmosensory afferents. This effect was associated with an increased rate of synaptic failures and occurred without changes in frequency facilitation, quantal size or in the ratio of postsynaptic responses mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors. We conclude that clock neurons mediate an activity-dependent presynaptic silencing of osmosensory afferent synapses onto vasopressin neurons and that osmoregulatory gain is enhanced by removal of this effect during late sleep.

The use of stimulants is one of the areas which has propelled the discussion on the potential for neuroscience to yield cognition-enhancing products. However, we have found in our review of the literature that the paradigms used to discuss the non-medical use of stimulant drugs prescribed for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) vary considerably. In this brief communication, we identify three common paradigms-prescription drug abuse, cognitive enhancement, and lifestyle use of pharmaceuticals-and briefly highlight how divergences between paradigms create important "ethics blind spots".

Mark			Cerebral asymmetries in 12-week-old C57Bl/6J mice measured by magnetic resonance imaging	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RESOLUTION 3D MRI; STRUCTURAL ASYMMETRIES; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; MOUSE-BRAIN; RAT THALAMUS; LATERALIZATION; ATLAS; NOREPINEPHRINE; STRAINS; AVERAGE	Asymmetries of multiple components of the rodent cerebrum have been described at various levels of organization. Yet, despite its ubiquitous nature, many confusing and sometimes contradictory reports regarding structural asymmetries in the rodent brain have been published. There is a need, therefore, for a whole-brain imaging analysis technique for asymmetry studies that is both accurate, reproducible and robust To this end, a comprehensive three-dimensional examination of differences in brain structure in an inbred mouse strain was undertaken. The goal of this study was thus to use high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to assess structural asymmetries in the adult C57Bl/6J mouse brain. Fixed brain T-2-weighted images of 20 male C57Bl/6J mice were acquired on a 7T scanner at 32 mu m isotropic resolution. We used voxel-based analyses to examine structural asymmetries throughout the whole mouse brain. The striatum, medial-posterior regions of the thalamus, and motor, sensorimotor, and visual cortex were found to be asymmetrical. The most significant asymmetry was found in the hippocampus and, specifically, the dentate gyrus. In each case, the left region was larger than the right No other regions of the mouse brain showed structural asymmetry. The results in the dentate gyrus were confirmed using stereology, revealing a correlation of r = 0.61 between magnetic resonance and stereological measures. Hippocampal, along with cortical asymmetry, has been discussed repeatedly in the literature, yet a clear pattern of directionality, until this point, has not been described. The findings of asymmetry in the striatum and absence of asymmetry in the rest of the brain are novel and show the advantage of using the whole-brain three-dimensional techniques developed herein for assessing asymmetry.

Central and peripheral injections of these peptides are implicated in the regulation of food intake at the level of the hypothalamus (central effects; increased food intake) and dorsal vagal complex (DVC) (peripheral effects; decreased food intake). The DVC of the brainstem is a satiety reflex key region, which includes the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), area postrema (AP) and dorso motor nucleus of the vagus (DMX). NPY binding sites were quantified on serial DVC sections using in vitro receptor autoradiography in two feeding adaptation models: fasting and inflammatory anorexia. Receptor autoradiography revealed that Y(1), Y(2), Y(4) and Y(5) receptor subtypes are present in all nuclei of the DVC. Additionally, we also observed significant amount of specific labelling remaining even after having blocked all known NPY receptor subtypes targeted by radioligands such as [(125)I][Leu(31), Pro(34)]PYY, [(125)I]PYY3-36 and [(125)I]hPP. This binding is referred as an atypical NPY site. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and food deprivation (24-48 h) did not induce any change in the expression of NPY Y(1), Y(2), Y(4) and Y(5) receptors at the level of the NTS and DMX. However, a significant decrease in [(125)I]PYY3-36/Y(2) and [(125)I]hPP/Y(4)- and Y(5)-insensitive binding sites (residual or atypical site) was observed in the AP. Together, these data could suggest that residual or atypical NPY binding site in the AP is modulated by food deprivation and may be physiologically relevant and implicated in feeding behaviors.

Contribution of the central dopaminergic system in the anti-hypertensive effect of kinin B1 receptor antagonists in two rat models of hypertension	NEUROPEPTIDES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Peptide Receptors and Kinin	JUN 26-30, 2009	Quebec City, CANADA			Kinin B1R antagonist; Blood pressure; Dopamine; Cardiovascular effect	BRADYKININ B-1 RECEPTOR; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; BINDING SITES; SPINAL-CORD; SENSORY ABNORMALITIES; UP-REGULATION; BRAIN; KALLIKREIN; CLASSIFICATION; HYPOTHALAMUS	Kinins are neuroactive peptides that could play a role in central autonomic control of blood pressure. Whereas kinin B1R binding sites were increased in specific brain areas of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Angiotensin II (AngII)-hypertensive rats, the contribution of kinin B1R in hypertension remains controversial. The aims of the study were to determine: (a) the effects on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of centrally and peripherally administered B1R antagonists in SHR (16 weeks) and AngII-hypertensive rats (200 ng/kg/min x 2 weeks, s.c.); (b) the contribution of central dopamine in the effects of SSR240612. The rationale is based on the overactivity of the dopaminergic system in hypertension. In both models, SSR240612 (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg, gavage) reduced dose-dependently MAP (>=-75 mm Hg at least up to 6-8 h) and this therapeutic effect was resolved after 24 h. At the dose of 5 mg/kg, SSR240612-induced anti-hypertension was prevented by two dopamine receptor blockers, namely raclopride (0.16 mg/kg, iv.) and haloperidol (10 mg/kg, s.c.). I.c.y. SSR240612 (1 mu g) decreased rapidly MAP in both models (1-6 h) via a raclopride sensitive mechanism. In comparison, peripherally acting B1R antagonists (R-715 and R-954, 2 mg/kg, s.c.) caused shorter and very modest decreases of MAP (from -20 to -30 mm Hg). Centrally or peripherally administered B1R antagonists had no effect on MAP in control Wistar-Kyoto rats. Data provide the first pharmacological evidence that the up-regulated brain kinin B1R contributes through a central dopaminergic mechanism (DA-D2R) to the maintenance of arterial hypertension in genetic and experimental animal models of hypertension.

Few reports have addressed whether any changes occur in central regulation of blood pressure (BP) and heart rat (HR) at the supraspinal level. Central tachykinin NK-1 and NK-3 receptors are located in many cardiovascular areas in the brain and are known to modulate BP and HR. This study examined the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) effects of the selective NK-1 receptor agonist [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP (65 pmol, n = 6) and NK-3 receptor agonist senktide (650 pmol, n = 6) on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR before and after complete spinal cord transection at thoracic level 4 (T4). [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP evoked increases in MAP and HR which were still present 4 days after the T4 SCI. Further analysis using the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (10 mg kg(-1)) revealed an increased contribution of HR in the MAP increase after SCI. For senktide, 2 and 5 weeks after T4 SO, the rise in MAP induced by senktide was significantly increased in magnitude and was similar to a normal response at 8 weeks. These effects were accompanied by a bradycardia, which was still present and amplified at 8 weeks. Our results reveal a transient potentiation of the senktide-mediated MAP effect and a greater contribution of the HR in MAP increase by [Sar(9), Met(O(2))(11)]SP in T4 transected rats. Although the significance of these changes remains to be established. This suggest a reorganization of supraspinal mechanisms regulating BP and HR after a high level SCI. Central NK-1 and NK-3 receptors might therefore contribute to the maintenance of MAP following high thoracic SCI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CDF Collaboration	Search for single top quark production in p(p)over-bar collisions at root s=1.96 TeV in the missing transverse energy plus jets topology	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER; PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; CDF; DETECTOR; PERFORMANCE; PHYSICS	We report a search for single top quark production with the CDF II detector using 2: 1 fb(-1) of integrated luminosity of p (p) over bar collisions at root s = 1.96 TeV. The data selected consist of events characterized by large energy imbalance in the transverse plane and hadronic jets, and no identified electrons and muons, so the sample is enriched in W -> tau nu decays. In order to suppress backgrounds, additional kinematic and topological requirements are imposed through a neural network, and at least one of the jets must be identified as a b quark jet. We measure an excess of signal-like events in agreement with the standard model prediction, but inconsistent with a model without single top quark production by 2.1 standard deviations (sigma), with a median expected sensitivity of 1.4 sigma. Assuming a top quark mass of 175 GeV/c(2) and ascribing the excess to single top quark production, the cross section is measured to be 4.9(-2.2)(+2.5) (stat + syst) pb, consistent with measurements performed in independent data sets and with the standard model prediction.

Improving the treatment of depression is challenging. Recently, the two-pore domain potassium channel TREK-1 has been identified as a new target in depression, and its antagonists might become effective antidepressants. In mice, deletion of the TREK-1 gene results in a depression-resistant phenotype that mimics antidepressant treatments. Here, we validate in mice the antidepressant effects of spadin, a secreted peptide derived from the propeptide generated by the maturation of the neurotensin receptor 3 (NTSR3/Sortilin) and acting through TREK-1 inhibition. NTSR3/Sortilin interacted with the TREK-1 channel, as shown by immunoprecipitation of TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin from COS-7 cells and cortical neurons co-expressing both proteins. TREK-1 and NTSR3/Sortilin were colocalized in mouse cortical neurons. Spadin bound specifically to TREK-1 with an affinity of 10 nM. Electrophysiological studies showed that spadin efficiently blocked the TREK-1 activity in COS-7 cells, cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and CA3 hippocampal neurons in brain slices. Spadin also induced in vivo an increase of the 5-HT neuron firing rate in the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus. In five behavioral tests predicting an antidepressant response, spadin-treated mice showed a resistance to depression as found in TREK-1 deficient mice. More importantly, an intravenous 4-d treatment with spadin not only induced a strong antidepressant effect but also enhanced hippocampal phosphorylation of CREB protein and neurogenesis, considered to be key markers of antidepressant action after chronic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. This work also shows the development of a reliable method for dosing the propeptide in serum of mice by using AlphaScreen technology. These findings point out spadin as a putative antidepressant of new generation with a rapid onset of action. Spadin can be regarded as the first natural antidepressant peptide identified. It corresponds to a new concept to address the treatment of depression.

Combined Inactivation of pRB and Hippo Pathways Induces Dedifferentiation in the Drosophila Retina	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							CELL-CYCLE EXIT; RETINOBLASTOMA PROTEIN; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; S-PHASE; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; PROMOTES APOPTOSIS; SIZE-CONTROL; STEM-CELLS; IN-VIVO; DIFFERENTIATION	Functional inactivation of the Retinoblastoma (pRB) pathway is an early and obligatory event in tumorigenesis. The importance of pRB is usually explained by its ability to promote cell cycle exit. Here, we demonstrate that, independently of cell cycle exit control, in cooperation with the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, pRB functions to maintain the terminally differentiated state. We show that mutations in the Hippo signaling pathway, wts or hpo, trigger widespread dedifferentiation of rbf mutant cells in the Drosophila eye. Initially, rbf wts or rbf hpo double mutant cells are morphologically indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts as they properly differentiate into photoreceptors, form axonal projections, and express late neuronal markers. However, the double mutant cells cannot maintain their neuronal identity, dedifferentiate, and thus become uncommitted eye specific cells. Surprisingly, this dedifferentiation is fully independent of cell cycle exit defects and occurs even when inappropriate proliferation is fully blocked by a de2f1 mutation. Thus, our results reveal the novel involvement of the pRB pathway during the maintenance of a differentiated state and suggest that terminally differentiated Rb mutant cells are intrinsically prone to dedifferentiation, can be converted to progenitor cells, and thus contribute to cancer advancement.

Since the treatment of the first patient at the McGill University Health Center in 1985, radiosurgery programs have been developed from coast to coast. These have included multidisciplinary teams of radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, medical physicists, radiation technologists and other health professionals. In 2008, the CARO Board of Directors requested that a working group be formed to define the role of the radiation oncologist in the practice of radiosurgery. Taking into account evolving technology, changing clinical practice and current scope of practice literature, the working group made recommendations as to the role of the radiation oncologists. These recommendations were endorsed by the Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology board of directors in September 2009 and are present herein. It is recognized that patients benefit from a team approach to their care but it is recommended that qualified radiation oncologists be involved in radiosurgery delivery from patient consultation to follow-up. In addition, radiation oncologists should continue to be involved in the administrative aspects of radiosurgery programs, from equipment selection to ongoing quality assurance/quality improvement.

Most are asymptomatic and represent incidental findings at imaging. In some instances, however, these muscles may become clinically relevant producing palpable swelling, entrapment of neurovascular structures, or exercise-related pain.

Based on the observation of the self-similarity of Internet traffic, we propose a new sampling technique (so-called the maximum-based sampling). We show that the resulting data suits perfectly for predicting the bandwidth required by upcoming traffic so that the resource provisioning can be done efficiently and intelligently especially for the context of IP over WDM networks. Hence, we prove mathematically that the proposed technique preserves the self-similarity of the traffic. Besides, experimental results using real Internet traffic show that unlike other sampling techniques (systematic sampling and stratified random sampling), the maximum-based sampling capture faithfully the traffic self-similarity. In order to assess the effect of the sampling technique impact on the performance of the traffic prediction,we undertake a series of prediction experiments using sampled traffic with the proposed technique and the other sampling techniques. A neurofuzzy model (alpha _SNF), the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA) and the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) are considered in this study for bandwidth prediction. Our experiments results show that the maximum-based sampled traffic-used for the identification of the prediction model-is the most suitable for predicting the traffic for different time scales.

Patterned sensory experience has long been known to induce various forms of developmental plasticity that ultimately shape mature neural circuits. These same types of plasticity also allow developing organisms to respond appropriately to the external world by dynamically adapting neural circuit function to ongoing changes in brain circuitry and sensory input. Recent work on the visual systems of frogs and fish has provided an unprecedented view into how visual experience dynamically affects circuit function at many levels, ranging from gene expression to network function, ultimately leading to system-wide functional adaptations.

Flexible modeling improves assessment of prognostic value of C-reactive protein in advanced non-small cell lung cancer	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						non-small cell lung cancer; inflammation; prognosis; C-reactive protein; albumin; survival analysis	NEURON-SPECIFIC ENOLASE; FRACTIONAL POLYNOMIALS; REGRESSION-MODELS; SURVIVAL ANALYSES; POOR-PROGNOSIS; TIME; COVARIATE; CHEMOTHERAPY; CARCINOMA; DISEASE	BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is gaining credibility as a prognostic factor in different cancers. Cox's proportional hazard (PH) model is usually used to assess prognostic factors. However, this model imposes a priori assumptions, which are rarely tested, that (1) the hazard ratio associated with each prognostic factor remains constant across the follow-up (PH assumption) and (2) the relationship between a continuous predictor and the logarithm of the mortality hazard is linear (linearity assumption). METHODS: We tested these two assumptions of the Cox's PH model for CRP, using a flexible statistical model, while adjusting for other known prognostic factors, in a cohort of 269 patients newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RESULTS: In the Cox's PH model, high CRP increased the risk of death (HR=1.11 per each doubling of CRP value, 95% CI: 1.03-1.20, P=0.008). However, both the PH assumption (P=0.033) and the linearity assumption (P=0.015) were rejected for CRP, measured at the initiation of chemotherapy, which kept its prognostic value for approximately 18 months. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that flexible modeling provides new insights regarding the value of CRP as a prognostic factor in NSCLC and that Cox's PH model underestimates early risks associated with high CRP.

Of the three mammalian 4E-BPs, only 4E-BP2 is enriched in the mammalian brain and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory formation. Here we describe asparagine deamidation as a brain-specific posttranslational modification of 4E-BP2. Deamidation is the spontaneous conversion of asparagines to aspartates. Two deamidation sites were mapped to an asparagine-rich sequence unique to 4E-BP2. Deamidated 4E-BP2 exhibits increased binding to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-binding protein raptor, which effects its reduced association with eIF4E. 4E-BP2 deamidation occurs during postnatal development, concomitant with the attenuation of the activity of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Expression of deamidated 4E-BP2 in 4E-BP2(-/-) neurons yielded mEPSCs exhibiting increased charge transfer with slower rise and decay kinetics relative to the wildtype form. 4E-BP2 deamidation may represent a compensatory mechanism for the developmental reduction of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling.

Although tissue temperature measurements performed in vivo using invasive thermocouple probes and MRI thermometry have demonstrated increased tissue temperature, the microscopic temperature distribution has not been investigated so far. In this study the transfer of heat between bubbles and tissue during focused ultrasound was simulated. Microbubble oscillations were simulated within a rat cortical microvascular network reconstructed from in vivo dual-photon microscopy images and the power density of these oscillations was used as an input term in the Pennes bioheat transfer equation. The temperature solution from the bioheat transfer equation was mapped onto vascular data to produce a three-dimensional temperature map. The results showed high temperatures near the bubbles and slow temperature rise in the tissue. Heating was shown to increase with increasing bubble frequency and insonation pressure, and showed a frequency-dependent peak. The goal of this research is to characterize the effect of various parameters on bubble-enhanced therapeutic ultrasound to allow better treatment planning. These results show that the induced temperature elevations have nonuniformities which may have a significant impact on the bio-effects of the exposure.

Participants made off-line acceptability judgments on well-formed sentences or those containing prosody-syntax mismatches. Behaviorally, both groups identified mismatches, but older subjects accepted mismatches significantly more often than younger participants. ERP results demonstrate CPS components and garden-path effects (P600s) in both groups, however, older adults displayed no N400 and more anterior P600 components. The data provide the first electrophysiological evidence suggesting that older adults process and integrate prosodic information in real-time, despite off-line behavioral differences. Age-related differences in neurocognitive processing mechanisms likely contribute to this dissociation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: We measured electromyographic (EMG) activity of twelve lower limb muscles, three-dimensional kinematics of the ankle, knee, hip and pelvis, foot posture and foot mobility to determine the physiological effect of ALD tape. Fourteen females with exercise related leg pain and 14 matched asymptomatic females walked on a treadmill under three conditions: pre-tape, tape and post-tape. A series of repeated measure analysis of variance procedures were performed to investigate differences in EMG, kinematic, foot posture and mobility measurements. Results: Application of ALD tape produced reductions in recruitment of tibialis anterior (7.3%) and tibialis posterior (6.9%). Large reductions in midfoot mobility (0.45 to 0.63 cm) and increases in arch height (0.58 cm), as well as moderate changes in ankle motion in the sagittal (2.0 to 5.3 degrees) and transverse planes (4.0 to 4.3 degrees) were observed. Reduced muscle activation (< 3.0%) and increased motion (< 1.7 degrees) was observed at more proximal segments (knee, hip, pelvis) but were of smaller magnitude than at the foot and ankle. Changes in foot posture, foot mobility, ankle kinematics and leg muscle activity did not persist following the removal of ALD tape, but at more proximal segments small changes (< 2.2 degrees, < 5.4% maximum) continued to be observed following the removal of tape. There were no differences between groups. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that ALD tape influences muscle recruitment, movement patterns, foot posture and foot mobility. These effects occur in individuals with and without pain, and are dissipated up the kinetic chain. ALD tape should be considered in the management of individuals where increased arch height, reduced foot mobility, reduced ankle abduction and plantar flexion or reduced activation of leg muscles is desired.

This clinical effect of quetiapine is hypothesized to be due to its low affinity for dopamine receptors and its weak attenuation of central reward functions. The present study was designed to determine the magnitude of the reward attenuation induced by different doses of quetiapine and its effectiveness at reducing the effect of cocaine. Experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats that were trained to produce operant responses to receive rewarding stimulations to the medial forebrain bundle. In a first study, we tested the effects of three doses of quetiapine (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) on brain stimulation reward using a within-subject design and the curve-shift method. In a second study, we tested the effectiveness of a low and high dose of quetiapine (5 and 20 mg/kg) at blocking the reward enhancing effect of cocaine (4 mg/kg) in different groups of animals. Quetiapine produced a weak (20%) but significant attenuation of reward. Cocaine enhanced reward by 20% and the combination of cocaine with the high dose of quetiapine lead to cancellation of each drug effect. The low dose of quetiapine did not alter baseline reward but completely blocked the effect of cocaine. The magnitude of the reward attenuation induced by quetiapine is consistent with its low affinity for dopamine receptors. Its actions on dopamine and non-dopamine neurotransmission are likely to account for its effectiveness at blocking the enhancement of reward by cocaine. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A functional interference can be taken as evidence that there is a parallel treatment of these two types of information and would argue for the biological grounding of language in action. A novel approach examining the relationship between language and grip force is presented. With eyes closed and arm extended, subjects listened to words relating (verbs) or not relating (nouns) to a manual action while holding a cylinder with an integrated force sensor. There was a change in grip force when subjects heard verbs that related to manual action. Grip force increased from about 100 ms following the verb presentation, peaked at 380 ms and fell abruptly after 400 ms, signalling a possible inhibition of the motor simulation evoked by these words. These observations reveal the intimate relationship that exists between language and grasp and show that it is possible to elucidate online new aspects of sensorimotor interaction.

Preclinical Evaluation of Radiation and Perifosine in a Genetically and Histologically Accurate Model of Brainstem Glioma	CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							IN-VIVO; NEURAL PROGENITORS; CHILDREN; TUMORS; CELLS; EXPRESSION; ASTROCYTOMAS; EGFR; OVEREXPRESSION; GLIOBLASTOMAS	Brainstem gliomas (BSG) are a rare group of central nervous system tumors that arise mostly in children and usually portend a particularly poor prognosis. We report the development of a genetically engineered mouse model of BSG using the RCAS/tv-a system and its implementation in preclinical trials. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor a is overexpressed in 67% of pediatric BSGs. Based on this observation, we induced low-grade BSGs by overexpressing PDGF-B in the posterior fossa of neonatal nestin tv-a mice. To generate high-grade BSGs, we overexpressed PDGF-B in combination with Ink4a-ARF loss, given that this locus is commonly lost in high-grade pediatric BSGs. We show that the likely cells of origin for these mouse BSGs exist on the floor of the fourth ventricle and cerebral aqueduct. Irradiation of these high-grade BSGs shows that although single doses of 2, 6, and 10 Gy significantly increased the percent of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive nuclei, only 6 and 10 Gy significantly induce cell cycle arrest. Perifosine, an inhibitor of AKT signaling, significantly induced TUNEL-positive nuclei in this high-grade BSG model, but in combination with 10 Gy, it did not significantly increase the percent of TUNEL-positive nuclei relative to 10 Gy alone at 6, 24, and 72 hours. Survival analysis showed that a single dose of 10 Gy significantly prolonged survival by 27% (P = 0.0002) but perifosine did not (P = 0.92). Perifosine + 10 Gy did not result in a significantly increased survival relative to 10 Gy alone (P = 0.23). This PDGF-induced BSG model can serve as a preclinical tool for the testing of novel agents. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2548-57. (C)2010 AACR.

The present study addressed this issue by means of a functional magnetic resonance adaptation paradigm during passive listening to unfamiliar songs. The repetition and variation of lyrics and/or tunes in blocks of six songs was crossed in a 2 X 2 factorial design to induce selective adaptation for each component. Reductions of the hemodynamic response were observed along the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STS/STG) bilaterally. Within these regions, the left mid-STS showed an interaction of the adaptation effects for lyrics and tunes, suggesting an integrated processing of the two components at prelexical, phonemic processing levels. The degree of integration decayed toward more anterior regions of the left STS, where the lack of such an interaction and the stronger adaptation for lyrics than for tunes was suggestive of an independent processing of lyrics, perhaps resulting from the processing of meaning. Finally, evidence for an integrated representation of lyrics and tunes was found in the left dorsal precentral gyrus (PrCG), possibly relating to the build-up of a vocal code for singing in which musical and linguistic features of song are fused. Overall, these results demonstrate that lyrics and tunes are processed at varying degrees of integration (and separation) through the consecutive processing levels allocated along the posterior-anterior axis of the left STS and the left PrCG.

J	Champod, AS; Petrides, M				Champod, Anne Sophie; Petrides, Michael			Dissociation within the Frontoparietal Network in Verbal Working Memory: A Parametric Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LATERAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; MENTAL ROTATION; MANIPULATION; FMRI; TASKS; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; BRAIN; INFORMATION	Concomitant increase in activity within the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (MDLFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is observed in most functional neuroimaging studies of working memory (Collette et al., 1999; Gerton et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2005; Postle et al., 2006; Champod and Petrides, 2007; Emery et al., 2008). Despite broad consensus on the importance of these two brain regions in working memory, their unique contribution, especially that of the PPC, remains a matter of heated debate (Paulesu et al., 1993; Smith and Jonides, 1998; Postle et al., 1999; Berryhill and Olson, 2008). The main objective of the present parametric event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to examine the hypothesis that the cortex in the intraparietal sulcus region in the PPC is involved in the manipulation (i.e., rearrangement) of verbal information in working memory and to dissociate the involvement of this brain region from that of the MDLFC in working memory processes. The results demonstrated a linear increase in activity within the MDLFC during the manipulation and monitoring of a linearly increasing number of words in working memory. In sharp contrast, there was a linear increase in activity within the PPC during the manipulation but not the monitoring of a linearly increasing number of words. This study provides the first parametric dissociation of activation in these two cortical regions indicating a crucial role of the PPC in the manipulation of information in working memory, with the MDLFC playing a major role in monitoring this information.

PIC micelles were prepared by mixing solutions of a Ca(2+)/MH chelate and CMD-PEG copolymer in a Tris-HCl buffer. Light scattering and (1)H NMR studies confirmed that Ca(2+)/MH/CMD-PEG core-corona micelles form at charge neutrality having a hydrodynamic radius approximate to 100 nm and incorporating approximate to 50 wt.-% MH. MH entrapment in the micelles core sustained its release for up to 24 h under physiological conditions. The micelles protected the drug against degradation in aqueous solutions at room temperature and at 37 degrees C in the presence of FBS. The micelles were stable in aqueous solution for up to one month, after freeze drying and in the presence of FBS and BSA. CMD-PEG copolymers did not induce cytotoxicity in human hepatocytes and murine microglia (N9) in concentrations as high as 15 mg.mL(-1) after incubation for 24 h. MH micelles were able to reduce the inflammation in murine microglia (N9) activated by LPS. These results strongly suggest that MH PIC micelles can be useful in the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.

HE manifests as a series of neuropsychiatric and neuromuscular symptoms including personality changes, sleep abnormalities, asterixis and muscle rigidity progressing through stupor to coma. The pathophysiologic basis of HE remains unclear. There is general agreement that ammonia plays a key role. In recent years, it has been suggested that oxidative/nitrosative stress constitutes part of the pathophysiologic cascade in HE. Direct evidence for oxidative/nitrosative stress in the pathogenesis of HE has been demonstrated in experimental animal models of acute or chronic liver failure. However, evidence from studies in HE patients is limited. This review summarizes this evidence for a role of oxidative/nitrosative stress in relation to ammonia toxicity and to the pathogenesis of HE.

It has been demonstrated, in vitro and in vivo, that acute and high ammonia treatment induces oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly reactive and can lead to oxidization of proteins resulting in protein damage. The present study was aimed to assess oxidative status of proteins in plasma and brain (frontal cortex) of rats with 4-week portacaval anastomosis (PCA). Markers of oxidative stress, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and carbonylation were evaluated by immunoblotting in plasma and frontal cortex. Western blot analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in either HNE-linked or carbonyl derivatives on proteins between PCA and sham-operated control rats in both plasma and frontal cortex. The present study suggests PCA-induced hyperammonemia does not lead to systemic or central oxidative stress.

Ammonia and proinflammatory cytokines modify expression of genes coding for astrocytic proteins implicated in brain edema in acute liver failure	METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE			English	Article						Ammonia; Acute liver failure; Neuroinflammation; Proinflammatory cytokines; Brain edema; Hepatic encephalopathy; Oxidative stress	FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; HEPATIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY; CULTURED ASTROCYTES; RAT ASTROCYTES; AMINO-ACIDS; AQUAPORIN-4; PATHOGENESIS; INFLAMMATION; MECHANISMS	There is evidence to suggest that, in acute liver failure (ALF), brain ammonia and proinflammatory cytokines may act synergistically to cause brain edema and its complications (intracranial hypertension, brain herniation). However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain to be established. In order to address this issue, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the expression of genes coding for astrocytic proteins with an established role in cell volume regulation in cerebral cortical astrocytes exposed to toxic agents previously identified in experimental and clinical ALF. Such agents include ammonia, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta) and combinations of the two. Exposure of cultured astrocytes to recombinant IL-1 beta (but not ammonia) resulted in increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4). Both ammonia and proinflammatory mediators led to decreased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a cytoskeletal protein, but these effects were not additive. On the other hand, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression were significantly increased by exposure to both ammonia and proinflammatory mediators and although modest, these effects were additive suggestive of a synergistic mechanism. These findings suggest that worsening of brain edema and its complications in ALF due to proinflammatory mechanisms may result from exacerbation of oxidative stress-related mechanisms rather than upregulation of AQP-4 or decreases in expression of the astrocytic structural protein GFAP.

However, effects of this treatment in ALF due to other toxins have not yet been fully investigated. In the present study, the effects of mild hypothermia in relation to liver pathology, hepatic and cerebral glutathione, plasma ammonia concentrations, progression of encephalopathy, cerebral edema, and plasma proinflammatory cytokines were assessed in mice with ALF resulting from azoxymethane (AOM) hepatotoxicity, a well characterized model of toxic liver injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with AOM (100 A mu g/g; i.p.) or saline and sacrificed at coma stages of encephalopathy in parallel with AOM mice maintained mildly hypothermic (35A degrees C). AOM treatment led to hepatic damage, significant increase in plasma transaminase activity, decreased hepatic glutathione levels, and brain GSH/GSSG ratios as well as selective increases in expression of plasma proinflammatory cytokines. Mild hypothermia resulted in reduced hepatic damage, improvement in neurological function, normalization of glutathione levels, and selective attenuation in expression of circulating proinflammatory cytokines. These findings demonstrate that the beneficial effects of mild hypothermia in experimental AOM-induced ALF involve both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

It is not known whether blood flow or metabolism is the primary limiting factor of brain function in this condition. We used calculations of mitochondrial oxygen tension to choose between cause and effect in three groups of volunteers, including healthy control subjects (HC), patients with cirrhosis of the liver without hepatic encephalopathy (CL), and patients with cirrhosis with acute hepatic encephalopathy. Compared to HC subjects, blood flow and energy metabolism had declined in all gray matter regions of the brain in patients with HE but not significantly in patients with CL. Analysis of flow-metabolism coupling indicated that blood flow declined in HE as a consequence of reduced brain energy metabolism implied by the calculation of increased mitochondrial oxygen tensions that patients with HE were unable to utilize. We ascribe the inability to use the delivered oxygen of patients with HE to a specific inhibition associated with oxidative metabolism in mitochondria.

Furthermore, hyponatremia is an important pathogenetic factor in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Both conditions have some features in common, such as the release of organic osmolytes, which might be an adaptive mechanism against cell swelling. However, the consequence of a possible relationship between osmoregulatory response in hyperammonemia and hyponatremia is not completely understood. This review gives a short introduction into the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and hyponatremia. For a comparison of both pathological events, some basics on cellular osmo- and volume regulation are explained, in particular as the mechanisms involved in the adaption of the cell to volume changes can be different under both pathological conditions. The role of brain glutamine and organic osmolytes in hyponatremia and hyperammonemia and their combination are discussed based on findings in experimental animal models, and finally on data obtained from primary astrocytes in culture. The observations that the decrease of brain organic osmolytes in astrocytes not adequately compensate for an increased intracellular osmolarity caused by glutamine are consistent with results obtained after chronic hyponatremia in rats, in which the release of osmolytes does not protect from ammonia-induced brain edema. Furthermore, a decrease in intracellular osmolarity is attributed both to the release and a reduced de novo synthesis of amino acids.

This system has been extensively studied using visual stimuli and recent evidence suggests that it is also responsive to the sound of motor actions. Here, we presented action (finger and tongue clicks) and acoustically matched sounds to investigate action-related sound processing in a 12-year-old child undergoing intracranial monitoring of epileptic seizures. Electroencephalography grids were located over a large portion of the right hemisphere, including motor cortex. Wavelet analysis carried out on electrodes overlying the functionally defined hand representation of the motor cortex revealed early (100 ms) and late (250-450 ms) decreases in mu rhythm power (12 and 20 Hz) selective for natural finger-clicks compared with control sounds. These data suggest the presence of a rapid, multimodal resonance mechanism modulating motor cortex activity.

Pediat Emergency Res Canada PERC H	CATCH: a clinical decision rule for the use of computed tomography in children with minor head injury	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Article							ACUTE ANKLE INJURIES; ACUTE KNEE INJURIES; C-SPINE RULE; PREDICTION RULES; METHODOLOGICAL STANDARDS; PROSPECTIVE VALIDATION; DELAYED DIAGNOSIS; LOW-RISK; TRAUMA; RADIOGRAPHY	Background: There is controversy about which children with minor head injury need to undergo computed tomography (CT). We aimed to develop a highly sensitive clinical decision rule for the use of CT in children with minor head injury. Methods: For this multicentre cohort study, we enrolled consecutive children with blunt head trauma presenting with a score of 13-15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale and loss of consciousness, amnesia, disorientation, persistent vomiting or irritability. For each child, staff in the emergency department completed a standardized assessment form before any CT. The main outcomes were need for neurologic intervention and presence of brain injury as determined by CT. We developed a decision rule by using recursive partitioning to combine variables that were both reliable and strongly associated with the outcome measures and thus to find the best combinations of predictor variables that were highly sensitive for detecting the outcome measures with maximal specificity. Results: Among the 3866 patients enrolled (mean age 9.2 years), 95 (2.5%) had a score of 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale, 282 (7.3%) had a score of 14, and 3489 (90.2%) had a score of 15. CT revealed that 159 (4.1%) had a brain injury, and 24 (0.6%) underwent neurologic intervention. We derived a decision rule for CT of the head consisting of four high-risk factors (failure to reach score of 15 on the Glasgow coma scale within two hours, suspicion of open skull fracture, worsening headache and irritability) and three additional medium-risk factors (large, boggy hematoma of the scalp; signs of basal skull fracture; dangerous mechanism of injury). The high-risk factors were 100.0% sensitive (95% CI 86.2%-100.0%) for predicting the need for neurologic intervention and would require that 30.2% of patients undergo CT. The medium-risk factors resulted in 98.1% sensitivity (95% CI 94.6%-99.4%) for the prediction of brain injury by CT and would require that 52.0% of patients undergo CT. Interpretation: The decision rule developed in this study identifies children at two levels of risk. Once the decision rule has been prospectively validated, it has the potential to standardize and improve the use of CT for children with minor head injury.

We documented the pharmacokinetic profile of oseltamivir in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with suspected or confirmed pandemic (H1N1) influenza. Methods: We included 41 patients 18 years of age and older with suspected or confirmed pandemic (H1N1) influenza who were admitted for ventilatory support to nine ICUs in three cities in Canada and Spain. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we assessed plasma levels of oseltamivir free base and its active metabolite carboxylate at baseline (before gastric administration of the drug) and at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 hours after the fourth or later dose. Results: Among the 36 patients who did not require dialysis, the median concentration of oseltamivir free base was 10.4 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.8-14.9) mu g/L; the median concentration of the carboxylate metabolite was 404 (IQR 257-900) mu g/L. The volume of distribution of the carboxylate metabolite did not increase with increasing body weight (R(2) = 0.00, p = 0.87). The rate of elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate was modestly correlated with estimations of creatinine clearance (R(2) = 0.27, p < 0.001). Drug clearance in the five patients who required continuous renal replacement therapy was about one-sixth that in the 36 patients with relatively normal renal function. Interpretation: Oseltamivir was well absorbed enterically in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU with suspected or confirmed pandemic (H1N1) influenza. The dosage of 75 mg twice daily achieved plasma levels that were comparable to those in ambulatory patients and were far in excess of concentrations required to maximally inhibit neuraminidase activity of the virus. Adjustment of the dosage in patients with renal dysfunction requiring continuous renal replacement therapy is appropriate; adjustment for obesity does not appear to be necessary.

Noradrenergic modulation of intrinsic and synaptic properties of lumbar motoneurons in the neonatal rat spinal cord	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						spinal cord; motoneuron; noradrenaline; synaptic drive; noradrenergic receptors; K(IR) current	ACTIVATED INWARD CURRENT; XENOPUS-LAEVIS TADPOLES; HYPOGLOSSAL MOTONEURONS; IN-VITRO; LOCOMOTOR CIRCUITS; N-TYPE; EXCITABILITY; NORADRENALINE; CLONIDINE; NEURONS	Although it is known that noradrenaline (NA) powerfully controls spinal motor networks, few data are available regarding the noradrenergic (NAergic) modulation of intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons in motor networks. Our work explores the cellular basis of NAergic modulation in the rat motor spinal cord. We first show that lumbar motoneurons express the three classes of adrenergic receptors at birth. Using patch-clamp recordings in the newborn rat spinal cord preparation, we characterized the effects of NA and of specific agonists of the three classes of adrenoreceptors on motoneuron membrane properties. NA increases the motoneuron excitability partly via the inhibition of a K(IR) like current. Methoxamine (alpha(1)), clonidine (alpha(2)) and isoproterenol (beta) differentially modulate the motoneuron membrane potential but also increase motoneuron excitability, these effects being respectively inhibited by the antagonists prazosin (alpha(1)), yohimbine (alpha(2)) and propranolol (beta). We show that the glutamatergic synaptic drive arising from the T13-L2 network is enhanced in motoneurons by NA, methoxamine and isoproterenol. On the other hand, NA, isoproterenol and clonidine inhibit both the frequency and amplitude of miniature glutamatergic EPSCs while methoxamine increases their frequency. The T13-L2 synaptic drive is thereby differentially modulated from the other glutamatergic synapses converging onto motoneurons and enhanced by presynaptic alpha(1) and beta receptor activation. Our data thus show that the NAergic system exerts a powerful and complex neuromodulation of lumbar motor networks in the neonatal rat spinal cord.

Species differences in group size and electrosensory interference in weakly electric fishes: Implications for electrosensory processing	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Electrotaxis; Gymnotiformes; Electrosensory; Social behavior	JAMMING AVOIDANCE-RESPONSE; TERM SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; ELECTROCOMMUNICATION SIGNALS; BEHAVIOR; ELECTROLOCATION; FREQUENCY; EIGENMANNIA; ORGAN; DEPRESSION	In animals with active sensory systems, group size can have dramatic effects on the sensory information available to individuals. In "wave-type" weakly electric fishes there is a categorical difference in sensory processing between solitary fish and fish in groups: when conspecifics are within about 1 m of each other, the electric fields mix and produce interference patterns that are detected by electroreceptors on each individual. Neural circuits in these animals must therefore process two streams of information-salient signals from prey items and predators and social signals from nearby conspecifics. We investigated the parameters of social signals in two genera of sympatric weakly electric fishes, Apteronotus and Stemopygus, in natural habitats of the Napo River valley in Ecuador and in laboratory settings. Apteronotus were most commonly found in pairs along the Napo River (47% of observations; maximum group size 4) and produced electrosensory interference at rates of 20-300 Hz. In contrast, Sternopygus were alone in 80% of observations (maximum group size 2) in the same region of Ecuador. Similar patterns were observed in laboratory experiments: Apteronotus were in groups and preferentially approached cons pecific-like signals in an electrotaxis experiment whereas Sternopygus tended to be solitary and did not approach cons pecific-like electrosensory signals. These results demonstrate categorical differences in social electrosensory-related activation of central nervous system circuits that may be related to the evolution of the jamming avoidance response that is used in Apteronotus but not Stemopygus to increase the frequency of electrosensory interference patterns.

Scyl1 Regulates Golgi Morphology	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPINOCEREBELLAR NEURODEGENERATION; RECESSIVE FORM; COPI VESICLES; PROTEIN; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS; GENE; APPARATUS; CLONING; TRAFFICKING	Background: Membrane trafficking is a defining feature of eukaryotic cells, and is essential for the maintenance of organelle homeostasis and identity. We previously identified Scy1-like 1 (Scyl1), a member of the Scy1-like family of catalytically inactive protein kinases, as a high-affinity binding partner of COPI coats. COPI-coated vesicles control Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum trafficking and we observed that disruption of Scyl1 function leads to a decrease in trafficking of the KDEL receptor via the COPI pathway. We reasoned that if Scyl1 plays a major role in COPI trafficking its disruption could influence Golgi homeostasis. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed Scyl1 knock down in cultured cells using previously established methods and observed an alteration in Golgi morphology. Both the surface area and volume of the Golgi is increased in Scyl1-depleted cells, but the continuity and polarity of the organelle is unperturbed. At the ultrastructural level we observe a decrease in the orderly structure of the Golgi with an increase in cisternal luminal width, while the number of Golgi cisternae remains unchanged. The golgin family of proteins forms a detergent resistant network that controls Golgi homeostasis. Disruption of this protein network by knock down of the golgin p115 disrupts the Golgi localization of Scyl1. Moreover, we find that Scyl1 interacts with 58K/formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (FTCD), a protein that is tightly associated with the cis face of the Golgi. Conclusions/Significance: Our results place Scyl1 at an interface between the golgin network and COPI trafficking and demonstrate that Scyl1 is required for the maintenance of Golgi morphology. Coupled with the observation from others that Scyl1 is the gene product responsible for the neurodegenerative mouse model mdf, our results additionally implicate the regulation of COPI trafficking and Golgi homeostasis in neurodegeneration.

This aspect of sympathetic nervous system function raises the prospect that the other arm of the autonomic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, may also affect bone remodeling. Here, we use various mutant mouse strains, each lacking one of the muscarinic receptors that mediate parasympathetic activity, to show that the parasympathetic nervous system acting through the M-3 muscarinic receptor is a positive regulator of bone mass accrual, increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. Gene expression studies, cell-specific gene deletion experiments, and analysis of compound mutant mice showed that the parasympathetic nervous system favors bone mass accrual by acting centrally and by decreasing the sympathetic tone. By showing that both arms of the autonomic nervous system affect bone remodeling, this study further underscores the importance of neuronal regulation of bone.

STUDY DESIGN: We used specialized software to analyze and categorize 7416 hours of EFM from term pregnancies. We measured how often and for how long each of the color-coded levels appeared in 3 groups of babies: (A) 60 babies with neonatal encephalopathy (NE) and umbilical artery base deficit (BD) levels were greater than 12 mmol/L; (I) 280 babies without NE but with BD greater than 12 mmol/L; and (N) 2132 babies with normal gases. RESULTS: The frequency and duration of EFM abnormalities considered more severe in the classification method were highest in group A and lowest in group N. Detecting an equivalent percentage of cases with adverse outcomes required only minutes spent with marked EFM abnormalities compared with much longer periods with lesser abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Both degree and duration of tracing abnormality are related to outcome. We present empirical data quantifying that relationship in a systematic fashion.

We sought to determine whether the partial administration of the Cognitive Behavioral Driver's Inventory (CBDI) has a significant effect on its concurrent validity. METHOD. Data were extracted from charts of clients with cerebrovascular accident or traumatic brain injury from three centers. The CBDI was administered either completely or partially (right and left perimetry or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R; Wechsler, 1982; Picture Completion and Digit Symbol tests were not completed). Concurrent validity indicators were calculated for the CBDI and three different scenarios of partial administration of the CBDI. RESULTS. Only 52% of the road test failures were predicted correctly by the completely administered CBDI. Nonadministration of the WAIS-R rarely modified the CBDI results. Omission of perimetry scores tended to increase the sensitivity and decrease the specificity (not significantly). CONCLUSION. The CBDI should be used as a complement, not a substitution, for a road test. Partially administrating the CBDI, specifically excluding perimetry measures, can affect its concurrent validity.

This has invigorated the causal debate of MS and generated immense interest in the patient and scientific communities. A potential shift in the treatment paradigm of MS involving endovascular balloon angioplasty or venous stent placement has been proposed as well as conducted in small patient series. In some cases, it may have resulted in serious injury. In this Point of View, we discuss the recent investigations that led to the description of CCSVI as well as the conceptual and technical shortcomings that challenge the potential relationship of this phenomenon to MS. The need for conducting carefully designed and rigorously controlled studies to investigate CCVSI has been recognized by the scientific bodies engaged in MS research. Several scientific endeavors examining the presence of CCSVI in MS are being undertaken. At present, invasive and potentially dangerous endovascular procedures as therapy for patients with MS should be discouraged until such studies have been completed, analyzed, and debated in the scientific arena.

SLICC	Prospective analysis of neuropsychiatric events in an international disease inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus	ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; FOLLOW-UP; COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; CLINICAL-TRIAL; PREVALENCE; CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE; MANIFESTATIONS; POPULATION; VALIDATION	Objectives To determine the frequency, accrual, attribution and outcome of neuropsychiatric (NP) events and impact on quality of life over 3 years in a large inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods The study was conducted by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics. Patients were enrolled within 15 months of SLE diagnosis. NP events were identified using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions, and decision rules were derived to determine the proportion of NP disease attributable to SLE. The outcome of NP events was recorded and patient-perceived impact determined by the SF-36. Results 1206 patients (89.6% female) with a mean (+/- SD) age of 34.5 +/- 13.2 years were included in the study. The mean disease duration at enrolment was 5.4 +/- 4.2 months. Over a mean follow-up of 1.9 +/- 1.2 years, 486/1206 (40.3%) patients had >= 1 NP events, which were attributed to SLE in 13.0-23.6% of patients using two a priori decision rules. The frequency of individual NP events varied from 47.1% (headache) to 0% (myasthenia gravis). The outcome was significantly better for those NP events attributed to SLE, especially if they occurred within 1.5 years of the diagnosis of SLE. Patients with NP events, regardless of attribution, had significantly lower summary scores for both mental and physical health over the study. Conclusions NP events in patients with SLE are of variable frequency, most commonly present early in the disease course and adversely impact patients' quality of life over time. Events attributed to non-SLE causes are more common than those due to SLE, although the latter have a more favourable outcome.	[Hanly, J.

The current study examined the effect of OT infusion on cell apoptosis, expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and inflammation in the acute and subacute phases of myocardial infarction (MI). Prior MI male Sprague-Dawley rats were infused subcutaneously with OT 25 or 125 ng/(kg h) for 3 or 7 days. Saline-treated MI and sham-operated rats served as controls. Echocardiography and analysis of cardiac sections were used to disclose OT actions. Left ventricular fractional shortening, estimated to be 46.0 +/- A 1.8% in sham controls, declined to 21.1 +/- A 3.3% in vehicle-treated MI rats and was improved to 34.2 +/- A 2.1 and to 30.9 +/- A 2.5% after treatment with OT 25 and 125 ng/(kg h), respectively. OT infusion resulted in: (1) increase of cells expressing PCNA in the infarct zone, diminished cell apoptosis and fibrotic deposits in the remote myocardium; (2) suppression of inflammation by reduction of neutrophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes; (3) depression of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 with promotion of transforming growth factor-beta. OT treatment reduced expression of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides in the infarcted ventricle, as well as the concentration of both peptides in the circulation. These results indicate that continuous OT delivery reduces inflammation and apoptosis in infarcted and remote myocardium, thus improving function in the injured heart.

Leptin modulates cell morphology and cytokine release in microglia	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						Inflammation; Microglia; Cytokines; Leptin; Chemokines; Lipopolysaccharide	LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-INDUCED FEVER; AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; FUNCTIONAL PLASTICITY; INTERLEUKIN-1 ACTIONS; SICKNESS BEHAVIOR; ENDOTOXIC-SHOCK; MICE DEFICIENT; BRAIN; MACROPHAGES; EXPRESSION	The appetite suppressing hormone, leptin is now established as an important component of the immune response to pathogens partly via the induction of brain IL-1 beta. We have previously demonstrated that this hormone acts on microglia to induce the release of IL-1 beta through actions on its functional receptors. In the present study, we extended these findings by demonstrating that leptin's action on microglia is that of a modulator rather than a direct trigger of inflammation. Using primary microglia cultures prepared from rat brain we show that pre-incubation of these cells with leptin for 24 h prior to treatment with LPS increased the IL-1 beta output 2-fold. This effect was not limited to IL-1 beta but was also true for another cytokine, TNF-alpha and chemokines such as CINC-1 and MIP-2. The role of leptin in potentiating the microglial response to LPS appeared to be linked to morphological changes rendering the microglia more reactive. These results suggest that leptin has an important role in microglial function in inflammation and given that its circulating levels fluctuate across a number of conditions, these findings can have important implications for an individual's ability to mount an efficient and complete response to invading pathogens.

The neuronal correlates of intranasal trigeminal function-an ALE meta-analysis of human functional brain imaging data	BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Review						Activation likelihood estimation; Olfaction; Nose; Somatosensory; fMRI; PET	HUMAN OLFACTORY CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PAINFUL CO2 STIMULATION; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; UPPER AIRWAY CO2; NASAL-MUCOSA; CEREBRAL ACTIVATION; PIRIFORM CORTEX; CHEMICAL-STIMULATION; MACAQUE MONKEY	Almost every odor we encounter in daily life has the capacity to produce a trigeminal sensation. Surprisingly, few functional imaging studies exploring human neuronal correlates of intranasal trigeminal function exist, and results are to some degree inconsistent. We utilized activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis tool, to analyze functional imaging data (fMRI/PET) following intranasal trigeminal stimulation with carbon dioxide (CO(2)), a stimulus known to exclusively activate the trigeminal system. Meta-analysis tools are able to identify activations common across studies, thereby enabling activation mapping with higher certainty. Activation foci of nine studies utilizing trigeminal stimulation were included in the meta-analysis. We found significant ALE scores, thus indicating consistent activation across studies, in the brainstem, ventrolateral posterior thalamic nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, precentral gyrus, as well as in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices -a network known for the processing of intranasal nociceptive stimuli. Significant ALE values were also observed in the piriform cortex, insula, and the orbitofrontal cortex, areas known to process chemosensory stimuli, and in association cortices. Additionally, the trigeminal ALE statistics were directly compared with ALE statistics originating from olfactory stimulation, demonstrating considerable overlap in activation. In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis map the human neuronal correlates of intranasal trigeminal stimulation with high statistical certainty and demonstrate that the cortical areas recruited during the processing of intranasal CO(2) stimuli include those outside traditional trigeminal areas. Moreover, through illustrations of the considerable overlap between brain areas that process trigeminal and olfactory information; these results demonstrate the interconnectivity of flavor processing.

The GAINN approach presented in this study first uses a simulation-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to characterize building behaviour, and then combines this ANN with a multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for optimization. The methodology has been used in the current study for the optimization of thermal comfort and energy consumption in a residential house. Results of ANN training and validation are first discussed. Two optimizations were then conducted taking variables from HVAC system settings, thermostat programming, and passive solar design. By integrating ANN into optimization the total simulation time was considerably reduced compared to classical optimization methodology. Results of the optimizations showed significant reduction in terms of energy consumption as well as improvement in thermal comfort. Finally, thanks to the multiobjective approach, dozens of potential designs were revealed, with a wide range of trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy consumption. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Acrolein induces apoptosis through the death receptor pathway in A549 lung cells: role of p53	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						acrolein; apoptosis; death receptor; caspase; p53; oxidative stress; A549 cell; Fas ligand	HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; SIGNALING COMPLEX; ALDEHYDE ACROLEIN; OXIDATIVE STRESS; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; FAS LIGAND; ACTIVATION; CASPASE-2; PROTEINS; NECROSIS	Acrolein, a highly reactive alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde, is an omnipresent environmental pollutant. Chronic and acute human exposures occur through exogenous and endogenous sources, including food, vapors of overheated cooking oil, house and forest fires, cigarette smoke, and automobile exhaust. Acrolein is a toxic byproduct of lipid peroxidation, which has been implicated in pulmonary, cardiac, and neurodegenerative diseases. This study shows that p53 is an initiating factor in acrolein-induced death receptor activation during apoptosis in A549 human lung cells. Exposure of cells to acrolein (0-50 mmol/ L) mainly caused apoptosis, which was manifested by execution phase events such as condensation of nuclear chromatin, phosphatidylserine externalization, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Levels of necrosis (similar to 5%) were low. Acrolein triggered the death receptor pathway of apoptosis, causing elevation of Fas ligand (FasL) and translocation of adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain to the plasma membrane. Acrolein caused activation of caspase-8, caspase-2, caspase-7, and the cross-talk pathway mediated by Bid cleavage. Activation of p53 and increased expression of p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) occurred in response to acrolein. FasL upregulation and caspase- 8 activation were decreased by p53 inhibitor pifithrin-a and antioxidant polyethylene glycol catalase. These findings increase our knowledge about the induction of cell death pathways by acrolein, which has important implications for human health.

ARCCS Study Investigators	Safety and Efficacy Results of the Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Sorafenib Expanded Access Program in North America	CANCER			English	Article							REFRACTORY SOLID TUMORS; FACTOR RECEPTOR INHIBITOR; DAYS ON/7 DAYS; RAF KINASE; PHASE-I; RECOMBINANT INTERLEUKIN-2; ANTITUMOR-ACTIVITY; INTERFERON-ALPHA; BAY 43-9006; BAY-43-9006	BACKGROUND: The Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Sorafenib (ARCCS) program made sorafenib available to patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) before regulatory approval. METHODS: In this nonrandomized, open-label expanded access program, 2504 patients from the United States and Canada were treated with oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Safety and efficacy were explored overall and in subgroups of patients including those with no prior therapy, nonclear cell (nonclear cell) RCC, brain metastases, prior bevacizumab treatment, and elderly patients. Sorafenib was approved for RCC 6 months after study initiation, at which time patients with no prior therapy or with nonclear cell RCC could enroll in an extension protocol for continued assessment for a period of 6 months. RESULTS: The most common grade >= 2 drug-related adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (18%), rash (14%), hypertension (12%), and fatigue (11%). In the 1891 patients evaluable for response, complete response was observed in 1 patient, partial response in 67 patients (4%), and stable disease for at least 8 weeks in 1511 patients (80%). Median progression-free survival in the extension population was 36 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 3345 weeks; censorship rate, 56%); median overall survival in the entire population was 50 weeks (95% CI, 46-52 weeks; censorship rate, 63%), The efficacy and safety results were similar across the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily demonstrated activity and a clinically acceptable toxicity profile in all patient subsets enrolled in the ARCCS expanded access program (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00111020).

Serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) internalization is isoform-specific: Effects of 5-HT and RS67333 on isoforms A and B	CELLULAR SIGNALLING			English	Article						Trafficking; Internalization; Recycling; 5-HT4R isoforms; RS67333; Antidepressants	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; FUNCTIONAL SELECTIVITY; MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS; SPLICE VARIANT; BETA-ARRESTIN; IN-VIVO; DESENSITIZATION; PHARMACOLOGY; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION	Serotonin 4 receptors (5-HT4Rs) are particularly abundant within the limbic system, where they constitute potential targets for the development of novel, rapid acting antidepressants. However, the population of limbic 5-HT4Rs is not homogenous, comprising various isoforms of which 5-HT4(a) and 5-HT4(b) are among the most abundant variants. Sequence divergence at their C-termini is predictive of specificity in isoform signalling and regulation, but the differences, if any, remain ill-defined. The present study compared isoforms 5-HT4(a) and 5-HT4(b) in their ability to undergo endocytic regulation following exposure to 5-HT and to the putatively fast acting antidepressant RS67333. Both ligands differed in their ability to induce internalization of either isoform, 5-HT being more effective than RS67333 in HEK293 cells and in neurons. In contrast, trafficking induced by 5-HT was isoform-specific. in particular, while PKC, GRK2 and beta arrestin were necessary for 5-HT4(a)R internalization, sequestration of 5-HT4(b)Rs required PKC but not GRK2 and relied significantly less on beta arrestin. After endocytosis, isoform (b) appeared scattered throughout the intracellular compartment and efficiently recycled to the membrane upon agonist removal. Isoform (a) accumulated in the perinuclear compartment and displayed little recycling. Isoform-specific subcellular distribution was present in HEK293 cells and in neurons. In neurons, where internalization by RS67333 was more pronounced than in HEK293 cells, receptors internalized by this ligand followed the same distribution pattern as observed with 5-HT. These results point to isoform-related differences in the way that 5-HTRs respond to different ligands. Such diversity should be taken into account when developing therapeutic agents that target 5-HT4Rs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To address this question in the context of predictive motor timing, we tested patients with various movement disorders implicating these two structures in a motor-timing task. Specifically, we investigated four different groups: (1) patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD); (2) patients with sporadic spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA); (3) patients with familial essential tremor (ET); and (4) matched healthy controls. We used a predictive motor-timing task that involved mediated interception of a moving target, and we assessed the effect of movement type (acceleration, deceleration and constant), speed (slow, medium and fast) and angle (0A degrees, 15A degrees and 30A degrees) on performance (hit, early error and late error). The main results showed that PD group and arm ET subgroup did not significantly differ from the control group. SCA and head ET subjects (severe and mild cerebellar damage, respectively) were significantly worse at interception than the other two groups. Our findings support the idea that the basal ganglia play a less significant role in predictive motor timing than the cerebellum. The fact that SCA and ET subjects seemed to have a fundamental problem with predictive motor timing suggests that the cerebellum plays an essential role in integrating incoming visual information with the motor output in a timely manner, and that ET is a heterogeneous entity that deserves increased attention from clinicians.

We examined the spatial distribution of sulcal pits across the entire cortical region, and assessed the hemispheric asymmetry in their frequency and distribution in a large group of normal adult brains. We automatically extracted sulcal pits from magnetic resonance imaging data using surface-based methods and constructed a group map from 148 subjects. The spatial distribution of the sulcal pits was relatively invariant between individuals, showing high frequency and density in specific focal areas. The left and right sulcal pits were spatially covariant in the regions of the earliest developed sulci. The sulcal pits with great spatial invariance appear to be useful as stable anatomical landmarks. We showed the most significant asymmetry in the frequency and spatial variance of sulcal pits in the superior temporal sulcus, which might be related to the lateralization of language function to the left hemisphere, developing more consistently and strongly than for the right. Our analyses support previous empirical and theoretical studies, and provide additional insights concerning the anatomical and functional development of the brain.

Immunosuppressant Neurotoxicity in Rat Brain Models: Oxidative Stress and Cellular Metabolism	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CYCLOSPORINE-A; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; MAMMALIAN TARGET; LEUKEMIA-CELLS; SDZ-RAD; SIROLIMUS; METABONOMICS	Coadministration of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine (CsA) and the mTOR inhibitors sirolimus (SRL) or everolimus (RAD) increases the efficacy of immunosuppression after organ transplantation. Neurotoxicity of CsA is a major clinical problem. Our goal was to assess the effects of CsA, SRL, and RAD on brain cell metabolism. The studies included the comparison of immunosuppressant-mediated effects on glucose metabolism, energy production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in perfused rat brain slices, primary rat astrocytes, and C6 glioma cells. In brain slices and astrocytes, CsA inhibited Krebs cycle metabolism, while activating anaerobic glycolysis, most likely to compensate for the inhibition of mitochondrial energy production. SRL and RAD inhibited cytosolic glycolysis but did not cause changes in mitochondrial energy production. CsA + SRL inhibited Krebs cycle and glycolysis, thus reducing the ability of the cell to compensate for the negative effects of CsA on mitochondrial nucleoside triphosphate synthesis. In contrast to SRL at the concentrations tested, RAD reduced the CsA-induced ROS formation and antagonized CsA-induced effects on glucose and energy metabolism. Surprisingly, in C6 cells, SRL and RAID exposure resulted in high ROS concentrations without significant impairment of cell metabolism. Our results suggested that SRL enhances CsA-induced ROS formation and negative metabolic effects in brain cells, while RAD seems to antagonize the CsA effects. However, the three models showed different metabolic responses when challenged with the study drugs. In contrast to SRL, RAD enhances ROS formation in C6 glioma cells but has only minor effects on normal rat brain tissue.

Logical rules of visual brain: From anatomy through neurophysiology to cognition	COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Rough set theory; Imprecise computation; Bottom-up fusion; Top-down extension; Receptive field logic; Fuzzy brain	STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; V1 NEURONS; AREA V4; ORGANIZATION; SHAPE; LGN; V2	Humans can easily recognize objects as complex as faces even if they have not seen them in such conditions or context before. It seems that perceptually we are insensitive to the exact properties of an object's parts but the same parts in different configurations or contexts may introduce contradictory effects. From a computational point of view, we are often insensitive to changes of some symbols, but the same symbols may lead to different classification of the same object. In present work we are looking for the anatomical and neurophysiological basis of these perceptual effects. We describe interactions between parts and their configurations in different areas of the visual brain on the basis of a single cell electrophysiological activity in the thalamus, and cortical areas V1 and V4. Our model is based on feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) interactions between these areas. In the retina and thalamus simple light spots are classified, V1 is the first area extracting edge orientation and V4 is the first area sensitive to simple shapes. The FF pathways combine properties extracted in each area into hypothetical objects. Area V1 presents concepts of orientations, while area V4 presents concepts of a simple shape. The FB pathways are responsible for comparison of the learned concepts with extracted object's properties-they form predictions. In each area structure related predictions are tested against hypothesis. We formulate a theory in which different visual stimuli are described through their condition attributes: responses in LGN, V1, and V4 neurons are divided into several ranges and are treated as decision attributes. Applying rough set theory [Pawlak, Z. (1991). Rough sets-theoretical aspects of reasoning about data. Boston, London, Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers] we have divided our stimuli into area dependent equivalent classes. We propose that relationships between decision rules in each area are determined by two different logical rules: "driver logical rule" of FF and "modulator logical rule" of FB pathways. These interactions are proposed to be a neurophysiological basis of the object classification. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The circulatory-respiratory determination of death in organ donation	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						organ donation; circulatory death; cardiac death; dead donor rule; auto-resuscitation; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation	EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE-OXYGENATION; HEART-BEATING DONORS; CARDIAC DEATH; BRAIN-DEATH; CARDIOCIRCULATORY DEATH; TRANSPLANTATION; SUPPORT; MEDICINE; RULE; RECOMMENDATIONS	Objective: Death statutes permit physicians to declare death on the basis of irreversible cessation of circulatory-respiratory or brain functions. The growing practice of organ donation after circulatory determination of death now requires physicians to exercise greater specificity in circulatory-respiratory death determination. We studied circulatory-respiratory death determination to clarify its concept, practice, and application to innovative circulatory determination of death protocols. Results: It is ethically and legally appropriate to procure organs when permanent cessation (will not return) of circulation and respiration has occurred but before irreversible cessation (cannot return) has occurred because permanent cessation: 1) is an established medical practice standard for determining death; 2) is the meaning of "irreversible" in the Uniform Determination of Death Act; and 3) does not violate the "Dead Donor Rule." Conclusions: The use of unmodified extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the circulatory determination of death donor after death is declared should be abandoned because, by restoring brain circulation, it retroactively negates the previous death determination. Modifications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation that avoid this problem by excluding brain circulation are contrived, invasive, and, if used, should require consent of surrogates. Heart donation in circulatory determination of death is acceptable if proper standards are followed to declare donor death after establishing the permanent cessation of circulation. Pending additional data on "auto-resuscitation," we recommend that all circulatory determination of death programs should utilize the prevailing standard of 2 to 5 mins of demonstrated mechanical asystole before declaring death.

OA and OR are conditions that affect the upper and lower airways, are characterized by reduced airway caliber and hyperresponsiveness and by inflammation, and are caused by agents present in the workplace. To explain disease expression, research is moving from the T-helper type 1/type 2 cells paradigm to consider the contribution of diverse alternative pathways such as neural inflammation, a dysfunctional epithelial barrier, and autoimmune mechanisms, among others. Objective assessment of OR and OA has been improved and tested for research and, currently, clinical application. Further developments in the field of OR are expected to lead to more generalized clinical applications, following the example of what has been achieved for OA.

Worldwide prevalence of the disease is estimated at more than 24 million cases. With aging of populations, this number will likely increase to more than 80 million cases by the year 2040. The annual incidence worldwide is estimated at 4.6 million cases which is the equivalent of one new case every seven seconds! The pathophysiology of AD is complex and largely misunderstood. It is thought to start with the accumulation of beta-amyloid (A beta) that leads to deposition of insoluble neuritic or senile plaques. Secondary events in this "amyloid cascade" include hyperphosphorylation of the protein tau into neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, oxidation, and excitotoxicity that eventually cause activation of apoptotis, cell death and neurotransmitter deficits. This review will briefly summarize recent advances in the pathophysiology of AD and focus on the pharmacological treatment of the cognitive and functional symptoms of AD. It will discuss the roles of vascular prevention, cholinesterase inhibitors and an NMDA-antagonist in the management of AD. It will address the issues thought to be related to the lack of persistence or discontinuation of therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors shown in recent studies and some of the solutions proposed. These include setting realistic expectations in light of a neurodegenerative condition and available symptomatic treatments, slowly titrating medications, and using alternate routes of administration. Finally, it will introduce future therapeutic options currently under study.

Circulating and tissue leukocytes and macrophages are a component of the mechanisms leading to inflammatory responses. Subsets of T lymphocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular remodeling. This is an area of active research and rapid development in cardiovascular and renal disease which offers great therapeutic potential. Recent findings Recent data suggest that subsets of T lymphocytes, both effector T cells such as T-helper (Th) 1 (interferon-gamma-producing) and Th2 lymphocytes [that produce interleukin (IL)-4], as well as Th17 (that produce IL-17), and T suppressor lymphocytes including regulatory T cells (Treg), which express the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), play critical roles in the development of angiotensin II, deoxycorticosterone salt-sensitive and Dahl salt-sensitive hypertension, and in the progression of vascular remodeling. As well, recent evidence suggests that the inflammatory response involving T lymphocytes may be triggered by oxidative stress in nuclei of the brain and associate with blood pressure elevation. Summary These new data implicating T lymphocytes will eventually allow discovery of new therapeutic targets that may improve outcomes in cardiovascular and renal disease in humans.

Many motor neuron survival factors (MnSFs) have been shown to suppress this default programmed cell death (PCD) program through their receptors (MnSFRs), raising the possibility that they are involved in matching specific MNs with their target muscles. Published observations suggest a combinatorial model of MnSF/Rs function, which assumes that during the PCD phase, MNs are expressing combinations of MnSFRs, whereas the limb muscles innervated by these MNs express cognate combinations of MnSFs. We tested this model by expression profiling of MnSFs and their receptors in the avian lumbosacral spinal cord and limb muscles during the peak PCD period. Our findings highlight the complexity of MnSF/Rs function in the control of LMC motor neuron survival. Developmental Dynamics 239:965-979, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	[Gu, Wendy X.

Methods: Brain slices were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g). Field and intracellular recordings were made from the EC during bath application of 4AP (50 mu m). AEDs, and in some experiments, picrotoxin were bath applied concomitantly. Results: Prolonged (> 3 s), ictal-like epileptiform events were abolished by CBZ (50 mu m), TPM (50 mu m), and VPA (1 mm), whereas shorter (< 3 s) interictal-like discharges continued to occur, even at concentrations up to 4-fold as high. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A)-receptor antagonism changed the 4AP-induced activity into recurrent interictal-like events that were not affected by CBZ or TPM, even at the highest concentrations. To establish whether these findings reflected the temporal features of the epileptiform discharges, we tested CBZ and TPM on 4AP-induced epileptiform activity driven by stimuli delivered at 100-, 10-, and 5-s intervals; these AEDs reduced ictal-like responses to stimuli at 100-s intervals at nearly therapeutic concentrations, but did not influence shorter interictal-like events elicited by stimuli delivered every 10 or 5 s. Conclusions: We conclude that the AED ability to control epileptiform synchronization in vitro depends mainly on activity-dependent characteristics such as discharge duration. Our data are in keeping with clinical evidence indicating that interictal activity is unaffected by AED levels that are effective to stop seizures.

Here, we conducted three studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) of the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) during action observation to determine: (i) the time course of M1 corticospinal excitability during the observation of a simple finger movement; (ii) the specificity of M1 modulation in terms of type of movement and muscle; and (iii) the relationship between M1 activity and measures of empathy and autistic traits. In a first study, we administered single-pulse TMS at 30-ms intervals during the observation of simple finger movements. Results showed enhanced corticospinal excitability occurring between 60 and 90 ms after movement onset. In a second experiment, TMS-induced MEPs were recorded from the FDI and abductor digiti minimi muscles while pulses were delivered 90 ms after movement onset during observation of simple finger movement and dot movement. Increased corticospinal excitability was restricted to finger movement and was present in both muscles. Finally, in an exploratory experiment, single-pulse TMS was administered at 30, 90 and 150 ms after movement onset, and participants were asked to complete the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Correlational analysis revealed a significant link between motor facilitation at 90 ms and the EQ and AQ scores. These results suggest that corticospinal excitability modulation seen at M1 during action observation is the result of a rapid and crude automatic process, which may be related to social functioning.

Sub-clinical postural control anomalies have recently been reported in children with TS. The goal of the present study was to determine whether these anomalies interact with attention in postural control. Thirty-two younger (below 10 years) and 21 older (above 10 years) children with TS were compared to 13 younger and 15 older age-matched controls. Postural control was examined during standing with and without a secondary visual attention task. Sway velocity was higher in younger children than older ones and also higher in children with TS than in controls. The secondary task exacerbated the velocity anomalies in younger children with TS. The effects were independent of tic severity, medication, and attention deficit. The results suggest that postural control anomalies in TS are sensitive to attentional requirements.

It has also been shown to slow axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury and inhibit axon regeneration in the optic nerve. Here, we assessed the ability of the corticospinal tract (CST) axons to regenerate after spinal hemisection and contusion injury in RPTP sigma deficient (RPTP sigma(-/-)) mice. We show that damaged CST fibers in RPTP sigma(-/-) mice regenerate and appear to extend for long distances after a dorsal hemisection or contusion injury of the thoracic spinal cord. In contrast, no long distance axon regeneration of CST fibers is seen after similar lesions in wild-type mice. lit vitro experiments indicate that cerebellar granule neurons from RPTP sigma(-/-) mice have reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) substrate, but not myelin, which may contribute to the growth of CST axons across the CSPG-rich glial scar. Our data suggest that RPTP sigma may function to prevent axonal growth after injury in the adult mammalian spinal cord and could be a target for promoting long distance regeneration after spinal cord injury.

Like MS, the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is characterized by CNS inflammation and demyelination and can follow a relapsing-remitting (RR) or chronic (CH) disease course. The molecular and pathological differences that underlie these different forms of EAE are not fully understood. We have compared the differences in RR- and CH-EAE generated in the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) using the same antigen. At the peak of disease when mice in both groups have similar clinical scores, CH-EAE is associated with increased lesion burden, myelin loss, axonal damage, and chemokine/cytokine expression when compared with RR-EAE. We further showed that inflammation and myelin loss continue to worsen in later stages of CH-EAE, whereas these features are largely resolved at the equivalent stage in RR-EAE. Additionally, axonal loss at these later stages is more severe in CH-EAE than in RR-EAE. We also demonstrated that CH-EAE is associated with a greater predominance of CD8(+) T cells in the CNS that exhibit MOG(35-55) antigen specificity. These studies therefore showed that, as early as the peak stage of disease, RR- and CH-EAE differ remarkably in their immune cell profile, chemokine/cytokine responses, and histopathological features. These data also indicated that this model of CH-EAE exhibits pathological features of a chronic-progressive disease profile and suggested that the sustained chronic phenotype is due to a combination of axonal loss, myelin loss, and continuing inflammation.

This study was undertaken to examine the relationship between endogenous sex hormone levels and cognitive functioning in healthy older men using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests and measurement of serum sex hormone levels. Verbal learning and memory, visual-motor processing, spatial abilities, working memory and attention, and levels of testosterone and estradiol were evaluated in 54 healthy older men. Regression analyses revealed significant curvilinear associations between working memory function and both free and bioavailable testosterone levels, suggesting that an optimal hormone level may exist for maximal performance on tasks of executive/frontal lobe functioning. However, no other relationships were evident between either estradiol or testosterone levels and any of the other cognitive functions evaluated. Hormone assays performed at the end of the study revealed that a considerable portion of the healthy elderly men in our sample met criteria for hypogonadism and suggests that their low hormone levels may have mitigated against discovering other significant hormone-cognition relationships.

Sympathoactivation may be one of the mechanisms linking intra-abdominal obesity to hypertension. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a functional variation in the androgen-receptor gene (AR, a variable number of CAG repeats in exon 1) is associated with intra-abdominal adiposity, sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone, and blood pressure in adolescent boys but not girls. We studied 223 boys and 259 girls (age 12 to 18 years) from a French-Canadian founder population. Intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous-abdominal fat were quantified with an MRI. Blood pressure was recorded beat-to-beat during an hour-long protocol including physical and mental challenges, and these blood pressure time series were used to assess sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone by power spectral analysis. The results showed that boys with a "low" versus "intermediate" or "high" CAG-repeat number in AR demonstrated higher intra-abdominal fat (by 28% and 48%, respectively) but not subcutaneous-abdominal fat. These intra-abdominal fat differences remained significant after adjusting for serum levels of sex hormones and subcutaneous-abdominal fat. Furthermore, boys with low versus intermediate or high CAG-repeat numbers also showed higher blood pressure, with the differences being most pronounced during mental stress (8.0 and 8.5 mm Hg, respectively) and higher sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone. As expected, no such differences were seen among girls. In adolescent boys, low CAG-repeat numbers in AR may be a genetic risk factor for intra-abdominal obesity and hypertension; sympathoactivation may be an underlying link between the 2 conditions.

J	Lafortune, D				Lafortune, Denis			Prevalence and screening of mental disorders in short-term correctional facilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Screening; Mental disorders; Correctional services; Short-term sentences	PRISONERS; ILLNESS	A majority of people incarcerated in correctional facilities have been affected by mental problems at least once in their lifetime. Among them, 12 to 25% suffer from severe and persistent mental disorders at the time of admission. Certain "profiles" are more likely to be detected than others. This is why the main objectives of this research are to establish, in both male and female offenders admitted in short-term detention facilities, the rate of those who have received medical diagnoses of mental disorders, the rate of screening for "mental health problems" at admission and the psychiatric diagnoses (last five years) most strongly associated with a positive screening. Using computerized medical and prison files, it can be established that 61% of the 671 offenders sent to a short-term correctional facility received, during 2002-2007, at least one diagnosis for mental disorder. A total of 227 subjects (33.8%) obtained a positive score to the indicator of mental health problem." In the case of men, correctional services workers identified as mental health problems: psychotic disorders, adjustment reactions, "neurotic"/anxiety disorders, being coupled to drug dependence. Positively detected women tend to exhibit problems of anxiety, personality disorder and substance related disorders. This study highlights, the difficulties faced by correctional services workers in detecting recent depressive disorders both in men and women offenders and also difficulties to detect recent affective psychoses.

In this article, an approach based on the combination of discrete Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in the ROC space is proposed to improve the performance of these systems. Inspired by the multiple-hypothesis principle, this approach allows the system to select, from a set of different HMMs, the most suitable solution for a given input sample. By training an ensemble of user-specific HMMs with different number of states and different codebook sizes, and then combining these models in the ROC space, it is possible to construct a composite ROC curve that provides a more accurate estimation of system performance. Moreover, in testing mode, the corresponding operating points-which may be selected dynamically according to the risk associated with input samples-can significantly reduce the error rates. Experiments performed by using a real-world off-line SV database, with random, simple and skilled forgeries, indicate that the multi-hypothesis approach can reduce the average error rates by more than 17%, as well as the number of HMM states by 48%.

In a group of humans with strabismic amblyopia, the relationship was examined between the structure and function of different brain regions. Three question were addressed: (1) Is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in humans with amblyopia structurally as well as functionally abnormal? (2) Do structural anomalies in the visual cortex correlate with the previously reported cortical functional losses? (3) Is there a link between the functional anomalies in the visual cortex and any structural anomalies in the geniculate? METHODS. The structure was compared by using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the function by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). RESULTS. The results showed that the geniculate is structurally abnormal in humans with strabismic amblyopia. CONCLUSIONS. These findings add further weight to the role of the LGN in the cortical deficits exhibited in human strabismic amblyopes.

Diffusion-weighted imaging is used for the evaluation of non-vascular diseases as well. Combined with conventional sequences, it is helpful to differentiate brain abscesses from necrotic tumors. Quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging provides additional information in the characterization of tumors or inflammatory, degenerative and metabolic lesions. Finally, diffusion-weighted imaging data also has prognostic value.

As such, ConA is known to induce membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) which expression is increased in brain cancer. Given that MT1-MMP correlated to high expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in gliomas with increasing histological grade, we specifically assessed the early proinflammatory cellular signaling processes triggered by ConA in the regulation of COX-2. We found that treatment with ConA or direct overexpression of a recombinant MT1-MMP resulted in the induction of COX-2 expression. This increase in COX-2 was correlated with a concomitant decrease in phosphorylated AKT suggestive of cell death induction, and was independent of MT1-MMP's catalytic function. ConA- and MT1-MMP-mediated intracellular signaling of COX-2 was also confirmed in wild-type and in Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) p65(-/-) mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), but was abrogated in NF-kappa B1 (p50)(-/-) and in I kappaB kinase (IKK) gamma(-/-) mutant MEF cells. Collectively, our results highlight an IKK/NF-kappa B-dependent pathway linking MT1-MMP-mediated intracellular signaling to the induction of COX-2. That signaling pathway could account for the inflammatory balance responsible for the therapy resistance phenotype of glioblastoma cells, and prompts for the design of new therapeutic strategies that target cell surface carbohydrate structures and MT1-MMP-mediated signaling. Concise summary Concanavalin-A (ConA) mimics biological lectin/carbohydrate interactions that regulate the proinflammatory phenotype of cancer cells through yet undefined signaling. Here we highlight an IKK/NF-kappa B-dependent pathway linking MT1-MMP-mediated intracellular signaling to the induction of cyclooxygenase-2, and that could be responsible for the therapy resistance phenotype of glioblastoma cells.

We presented human bodies in a block-design experiment to identify body-responsive regions of the brain, namely, extrastriate body area (EBA) and fusiform body area (FBA). In a separate event-related "adaptation" experiment, carried out in the same group of subjects, we presented sets of four human bodies of varying body size and shape. Varying levels of body morphing were introduced to assess the degree of morphing required for adaptation release. Analysis of BOLD signal in the block-design experiment revealed significant Sex x Hemisphere interactions in the EBA and the FBA responses to human bodies. Only women showed greater BOLD response to bodies in the right hemisphere compared with the left hemisphere for both EBA and FBA. The BOLD response in right EBA was higher in women compared with men. In the adaptation experiment, greater right versus left hemisphere response for EBA and FBA was also identified among women but not men. These findings are particularly novel in that they address potential sex differences in the lateralization of EBA and FBA responses to human body images. Although previous studies have found some degree of right hemisphere dominance in body perception, our results suggest that such a functional lateralization may differ between men and women.

PERSPECTIVES OF CANADIAN RESEARCHERS ON ETHICS REVIEW OF NEUROIMAGING RESEARCH	JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS			English	Review						neuroimaging; research ethics; research ethics committees; fMRI; Canada; incidental findings; science communication; neuroethics; ethics governance	INCIDENTAL FINDINGS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN MRI; RECOMMENDATIONS; CHALLENGES; DISCLOSURE; BIOETHICS; ISSUES; IMAGES; BOARDS	THE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USES OF neuroimaging in healthcare and beyond have spurred discussion about the ethical issues related to neuroimaging and neuroimaging research. This study examined the perspectives of neuroimagers on ethical issues in their research and on the ethics review process. One hundred neuroimagers from 13 Canadian neuroscience centers completed an online survey and 35 semi-structured interviews were conducted. Neuroimagers felt that most ethical and social issues identified in the literature were dealt with adequately, well, and even very well by research ethics boards (REBs), but some issues such as incidental findings and transfer of knowledge were problematic. Neuroimagers reported a range of practical problems in the ethics review process. We aimed to gather perspectives from REB on the ethics review process, but insufficient participation by REBs prevented us from reporting their perspectives. Given shortcomings identified by neuroimagers as well as longstanding issues in Canadian ethics governance, we believe that substantial challenges exist in Canadian research ethics governance that jeopardize trust, communication, and the overall soundness of research ethics governance. Neuroimagers and REBs should consider their shared responsibilities in developing guidance to handle issues such as incidental findings, risk assessment, and knowledge transfer.

However, little research has been done with adolescents. In addition, expressing and understanding facial expressions is yet to be studied among adolescents with LD subtypes. This study examined abilities of adolescents with NVLD, with general learning disabilities (GLD), and without LD to recognize, express, and understand facial expressions of emotion. Adolescents were grouped into those with NVLD, with GLD, and without LD using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (short form) and Wide Range Achievement Test-Third Edition. The adolescents completed neuropsychological, recognition, expression, and understanding measures. It is intriguing that the GLD group was significantly less accurate at recognizing and understanding facial expressions compared with the NVLD and NLD groups, who did not differ. Implications are explored with regard to the need to consider possible deficits in recognition and understanding of emotion in adolescents with LD in schools.

Here we show that components of both bone morphogenetic protein/growth differentiation factor and TGF-beta/activin/Nodal branches of TGF-beta superfamily signaling are expressed in the developing subpallium. Furthermore, Smad proteins, transcriptional effectors of TGF-beta signaling, are co-expressed and physically interact in the basal ganglia with Dlx homeodomain transcription factors, which are critical regulators of the differentiation, migration and survival of telencephalic GABAergic neurons. We also show that Dlx and Smad proteins localize to promoters/enhancers of a number of common telencephalic genes in vivo and that Smad proteins co-activate transcription with Dlx family members, except with certain mutated human DLX proteins identified in autistic individuals. In agreement with these observations, expression of dominant-negative Smads in the developing basal ganglia phenocopies the cell migration defects observed in Dlx1/2-deficient mice. Together, these results suggest that TGF-beta superfamily signaling plays a role in telencephalic GABAergic neuron development through functional interactions with Dlx transcription factors.

Hip position and loading of limb extensors are major sensory cues for the initiation and duration of different phases during walking. Although these inputs have pathways projecting to the locomotor rhythm generator, their effects may vary in different parts of the locomotor cycle. In the present study, the plantaris (Pl), sartorius (Sart), rectus femoris (RF), and caudal gluteal (cGlu) nerves were stimulated at group I and/or group II strength during spontaneous fictive locomotion in 16 adult decerebrate cats. These nerves supply muscles that extend the ankle (Pl), flex the hip (Sart, RF), or extend the hip (cGlu). Stimuli were given at six epochs of the locomotor cycle to evaluate when they access the rhythm generator. Group I afferents from Pl nerve always reset the locomotor rhythm; stimulation during extension prolonged cycle period and extension phase duration, while stimulation during flexion terminated flexion and initiated extension. On the other hand, stimulating RF and cGlu nerves only produced significant effects on the rhythm in precise epochs, particularly during mid-flexion and/or mid-to late extension. Stimulating the Sart nerve produced complex effects on the rhythm that were not distributed evenly to all extensor motor pools. The most consistent effect was reduced flexion phase duration with stimulation during flexion, particularly at group II strength, and prolongation of the extension phase but only in late extension. That hip muscle afferents reset the rhythm in only specific epochs of the locomotor cycle suggests that the rhythm generator operates with several subdivisions to determine phase and cycle durations.

Temporal coding by populations of auditory receptor neurons. J Neurophysiol 103: 1614-1621, 2010. First published January 13, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00621.2009. Auditory receptor neurons of crickets are most sensitive to either low or high sound frequencies. Earlier work showed that the temporal coding properties of first-order auditory interneurons are matched to the temporal characteristics of natural low- and high-frequency stimuli (cricket songs and bat echolocation calls, respectively). We studied the temporal coding properties of receptor neurons and used modeling to investigate how activity within populations of low- and high-frequency receptors might contribute to the coding properties of interneurons. We confirm earlier findings that individual low- frequency-tuned receptors code stimulus temporal pattern poorly, but show that coding performance of a receptor population increases markedly with population size, due in part to low redundancy among the spike trains of different receptors. By contrast, individual high-frequency-tuned receptors code a stimulus temporal pattern fairly well and, because their spike trains are redundant, there is only a slight increase in coding performance with population size. The coding properties of low- and high-frequency receptor populations resemble those of interneurons in response to low- and high-frequency stimuli, suggesting that coding at the interneuron level is partly determined by the nature and organization of afferent input. Consistent with this, the sound-frequency-specific coding properties of an interneuron, previously demonstrated by analyzing its spike train, are also apparent in the subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential that are generated by synaptic input from receptor neurons.

Model-Based Damage Identification in a Continuous Bridge Using Vibration Data	JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES			English	Article							STRUCTURAL DAMAGE; ELEMENT	Damage often causes changes in the dynamic characteristics of a structure such as frequencies and mode shapes. Vibration-based damage identification techniques utilize the changes in the dynamic characteristics of a structure to determine the location and extent of damage in the structure. Such techniques are applied in this study to the Crowchild Bridge, a steel-free deck continuous bridge located in western Canada. While the numerical models of the bridge are correlated with the measured dynamic characteristics, computer simulation is used to study the identification of a number of different damage patterns, and the effects of measurement errors and incomplete mode shapes on the quality of results are evaluated. The effectiveness of some selected damage identification techniques is examined; the potential difficulties in identifying the damage are outlined; and areas of further research are suggested. A three-dimensional finite-element model and a simple two-dimensional girder model of the bridge have been constructed to study the usefulness of the selected damage identification methods. Another promising damage detection method proposed here is based on the application of neural networks that combines a vibration-based method.

This paper presents a study which uses artificial neural networks to investigate the importance and influence of certain characteristics of sewer pipes upon their structural performance, expressed in terms of condition rating. In this study, back propagation and probabilistic neural network (NN) models were developed and validated. The data used in the development of these models were provided by the municipality of Pierrefonds, Quebec. It comprised of parameters related to sewer pipelines, pipe diameter, buried depth/cover, bedding material, pipe material, pipeline length, age, and closed circuit television (CCTV) based structural condition rating. The first six parameters are the independent variables of the models whereas CCTV based condition rating for these pipes is the dependent variable (i.e., the output of the models). The developed NN models were used to rank the parameters, in order of their importance/influence on pipe condition. It was found that, among the studied parameters, material attributes have highest influence on pipe structural condition, respectively, followed by the geometric and physical attribute group. Sensitivity analysis was then performed to simulate the structural condition of a pipe at a range of values of each input parameters. Results of sensitivity analysis describe the nature and degree of the influence of each parameter on pipe structural condition. The developed models are expected to benefit academics and practitioners (municipal engineers, consultants, and contractors) to prioritize inspection and rehabilitation plans for existing sewer mains.

Relatively few morphological studies have examined structures thought to subserve inhibitory control, one of the diagnostic features of ADHD. We examined one such region, the pars opercularis, predicting a thinner cortex of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in children with ADHD. Method: Structural images were obtained from 49 children (24 control; 25 ADHD combined subtype) aged 9 though 15 years. Images were processed using a volumetric pipeline to provide a fully automated estimate of regional volumes of gray and white matter. A further analysis using FreeSurfer provided measures of cortical thickness for each lobe, and for 13 regions in the frontal lobe. Results: Relative to controls, children with ADHD had smaller whole brain volume and lower gray matter, but not white matter, volumes in all lobes. An analysis of frontal regions showed a significant interaction of group by region. Planned contrasts showed bilateral thinner cortex in the pars opercularis in children with ADHD. Conclusions: Children with ADHD showed both diffuse and regional gray matter abnormalities. Consistent with its putative role in response inhibition, the cortex of the pars opercularis was thinner in children with ADHD who, as expected, had significantly poorer inhibitory performance on a Go/No-go task. These differences held for both hemispheres raising the possibility that a developmental abnormality of IFG might drive development of inhibition difficulties. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

In this article, we report findings oil 41 out-patients with diagnosed MS who underwent detailed neuropsychological and social-cognitive assessment. They were subdivided into a cognitively intact (n=15) and cognitively impaired (n=26) group according to their neuropsychological test results. Their results were compared with those of 20 age- and education-matched controls. MS patients with cognitive impairments were found to have more difficulties attributing mental states to others than did cognitively intact MS patients and normal controls oil two ToM measures short stories (Happe, Winner, & Brownell, 1999) and video clips (Ouellet, Bedirian, Charbonneau, & Scherzer, 2009). When attention, memory, and working memory were controlled, performance oil the WAIS-III Picture Arrangement task accounted for 17.3% of the variance in performance on the video clips task. Performance on a WAIS-III index composed of Similarities and Comprehension subtests, accounted for 7.0% of the variance in performance oil the short stories task. These results provide some preliminary information on the effect of MS-related cognitive deficits on the ability to attribute mental states to others. (JINS, 2010, 16, 287-296.)

Recognizing vocal expressions of emotion in patients with social skills deficits following traumatic brain injury	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Emotion perception; Prosody; Semantic; Inhibitory control; Filtered; Nonsense	BLUNT HEAD-INJURY; AFFECTIVE PROSODY; FACIAL EXPRESSION; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; NEURAL RESPONSE; DAMAGED ADULTS; PERCEPTION; RECOGNITION; SPEECH; LESIONS	Perception of emotion in voice is impaired following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This Study examined whether an inability to concurrently process semantic information (the "what") and emotional prosody (the "how") of spoken speech contributes to impaired recognition of emotional prosody and whether impairment is ameliorated when little or no semantic information is provided. Eighteen individuals with mod crate-to-severe TBI showing social skills deficits during inpatient rehabilitation were compared with 18 demographically matched controls. Participants completed two discrimination tasks using spoken sentences that varied in the amount of semantic information: that is, (I) well-formed English, (2) a nonsense language, and (3) low-pass filtered speech producing "muffled" voices. Reducing semantic processing demands did not improve perception of emotional prosody. The TBI group were significantly less accurate than controls. Impairment was greater within the TB I group when accessing semantic memory to label the emotion of sentences, compared with simply making "same/different" judgments. Findings suggest an impairment of processing emotional prosody itself rather than semantic processing demands which leads to an over-reliance oil the "what" rather than the "how," in conversational remarks. Emotional recognition accuracy was significantly related to the ability to inhibit prepotent responses, consistent with neuroanatomical research suggesting similar ventrofrontal systems subserve both functions.

Second Language Acquisition of Gender Agreement in Explicit and Implicit Training Conditions: An Event-Related Potential Study	LANGUAGE LEARNING			English	Article						second language acquisition; event-related potentials; language processing; explicit; implicit; agreement	BRAIN POTENTIALS; NONNATIVE SPEAKERS; NUMBER AGREEMENT; ERP EVIDENCE; LANGUAGE; VIOLATIONS; SPANISH; LEARNERS; INTEGRATION; GRAMMAR	This study employed an artificial language learning paradigm together with a combined behavioral/event-related potential (ERP) approach to examine the neurocognition of the processing of gender agreement, an aspect of inflectional morphology that is problematic in adult second language (L2) learning. Subjects learned to speak and comprehend an artificial language under either explicit (classroomlike) or implicit (immersionlike) training conditions. In each group, both noun-article and noun-adjective gender agreement processing were examined behaviorally and with ERPs at both low and higher levels of proficiency. Results showed that the two groups learned the language to similar levels of proficiency but showed somewhat different ERP patterns. At low proficiency, both types of agreement violations (adjective, article) yielded N400s, but only for the group with implicit training. Additionally, noun-adjective agreement elicited a late N400 in the explicit group at low proficiency. At higher levels of proficiency, noun-adjective agreement violations elicited N400s for both the explicit and implicit groups, whereas noun-article agreement violations elicited P600s for both groups. The results suggest that interactions among linguistic structure, proficiency level, and type of training need to be consideredwhen examining the development of aspects of inflectional morphology in L2 acquisition.

This process is important to generate cell diversity during the development of multicellular organisms, as well as for stern cell self-renewal in adults. Current knowledge on so-called cancer stem cells suggests that a loss of asymmetry during their division could lead to overproliferation and favour tumorigenesis, highlighting the importance of deciphering the mechanisms governing asymmetric cell division. Two mechanisms can lead to an asymmetric cell division: asymmetry can either be governed by proximity to a given cellular environment (or niche), in which case the mechanism is referred to as extrinsic, or the mother cell polarizes itself without external intervention, in which case the mechanism is referred to as intrinsic. In the last 20 years, our understanding of intrinsic mechanisms leading to asymmetric cell division has progressed, largely after studies carried out in model organisms such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. These models allowed the identification of molecular complexes used by nearly all the cells that divide asymmetrically, including human cells. Here we review the main intrinsic mechanisms of asymmetric cell division as described in model organisms and discuss their relevance towards mammalian tumorigenesis.

Both methods have been suggested to provide improved myelin specificity compared to conventional MRI. The goal of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of each technique to the progression of acute, gadolinium-enhancing regions of multiple sclerosis. Magnetization transfer and T-2 relaxometry data were acquired longitudinally over the course of 1 year in five relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients and in five healthy controls. Parametric maps were analyzed in enhancing lesions and normal-appearing white matter regions. Quantitative magnetization transfer parameters in lesions were most abnormal at the time of enhancement and followed a pattern of recovery over subsequent months. Lesion myelin water fraction was abnormal but did not show a significant trend over time. Quantitative magnetization transfer was able to track the degree and timing of the partial recovery in enhancing multiple sclerosis lesions in a small group of patients, while the recovery was not detected in myelin water estimates, possibly due to their large variability. Our data suggest the recovery is characterized by quick resolution of inflammation and a slower remyelination process. Magn Reson Med 63:633-640, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Purpose: To compare neuromuscular control of the lower limb during gait between individuals with and without a history of exercise-related leg pain (ERLP). Methods: Fourteen females with a history of ERLP and 14 age-, height-, and weight-matched asymptomatic female controls participated in the study. Electromyographic activity, normalized to maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), from 12 lower limb muscles during walking gait was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were three-dimensional kinematics of the lower limb during gait, measurements of static foot posture (arch height and midfoot width in weight bearing and non-weight bearing), and foot mobility (difference in arch height and midfoot width from non-weight bearing to weight bearing and foot mobility magnitude). Results: Individuals with a history of ERLP demonstrated lower peak activation (13.7% MVC, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.2%-24.3% MVC) and lower average activation of gluteus medius (2.3% MVC, 95% CI = 0.3%-4.3% MVC) when compared with controls (P < 0.05). This reduction in gluteus medius activation was moderately determined (57.1%, P = 0.01) by the duration (beta = 0.555) and severity of pain (beta = -0.516). Peak and average activation of lateral gastrocnemius were also lower than controls (20.5% MVC, 95% CI = 0.6%-40.5% MVC and 1.7% MVC, 95% CI = 0.2%-3.1% MVC, respectively) but were not explained by pain duration or severity. No differences in kinematics at the ankle, knee, hip and pelvis, or differences in static foot posture and mobility were observed between groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of altered neuromuscular control of gait in females with a history of ERLP. Further work is required to discern the clinical relevance of this finding.

Efforts to tackle this problem have been hampered by the scarcity of markers that can be used to predict cell division outcomes. Here we present a computational method, based on algorithmic information theory, to analyze dynamic features of living cells over time. Using this method, we asked whether rat retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) display characteristic phenotypes before undergoing mitosis that could foretell their fate. We predicted whether RPCs will undergo a self-renewing or terminal division with 99% accuracy, or whether they will produce two photoreceptors or another combination of offspring with 87% accuracy. Our implementation can segment, track and generate predictions for 40 cells simultaneously on a standard computer at 5 min per frame. This method could be used to isolate cell populations with specific developmental potential, enabling previously impossible investigations.

The network under consideration is a three-layered perceptron with two hidden neurons having the sigmoid serving as the activation function. The analysis of the hidden space created by the outputs of the hidden neurons will provide results on the network's capacity to isolate two classes of data in a bilinear fashion, and the importance of the value of the sigmoid parameter is highlighted. We will obtain an explicit analytical function describing the boundary generated by the network, thus providing information on the effect each parameter has on the network's behavior. Generalizations of the results are obtained with additional neurons, and a theorem concerned with analytical reproducibility of the boundary function is established.

We tested this hypothesis by administering the CB(1) receptor agonist WIN55,212-2, once daily for 20 days to adolescent and adult rats, subsequently subjecting them to tests for emotional reactivity paralleled by the in vivo extracellular recordings of serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons. Chronic adolescent exposure but not adult exposure to low (0.2 mg/kg) and high (1.0 mg/kg) doses led to depression-like behaviour in the forced swim and sucrose preference test, while the high dose also induced anxiety-like consequences in the novelty-suppressed feeding test Electrophysiological recordings revealed both doses to have attenuated serotonergic activity, while the high dose also led to a hyperactivity of noradrenergic neurons only after adolescent exposure. These suggest that long-term exposure to cannabinoids during adolescence induces anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours in adulthood and that this may be instigated by serotonergic hypoactivity and noradrenergic hyperactivity.

Neuronal differentiation by analogs of staurosporine	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Neuronal differentiation; Staurosporine; Structure-function; Retinal ganglion cells; Kinase inhibition	HUMAN NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS; NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; PROTEIN-KINASE INHIBITOR; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; PC12 CELLS; INDUCTION; LINE; APOPTOSIS; POTENT; UCN-01	RGC-5 cells are transformed cells that express several surface markers characteristic of neuronal precursor cells, but resemble glial cells morphologically and divide in culture. When treated with the apoptosis-inducing agent staurosporine, RGC-5 cells assume a neuronal morphology, extend neurites, stop dividing, and express ion channels without acute signs of apoptosis. This differentiation with staurosporine is similar to what has been described for certain other neuronal cell lines, and occurs by a mechanism not yet understood. Inhibition of several kinases known to be inhibited by staurosporine fails to differentiate RGC-5 cells, and examination of the kinome associated with staurosporine-dependent differentiation has been unhelpful so far. To better understand the mechanism of staurosporine-mediated differentiation of neuronal precursor cells, we studied the effects of the following structurally similar molecules on differentiation of neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines, comparing them to staurosporine: 9,12-epoxy-1H-diindolo[1,2,3-fg:3',2',1'-kl]pyrrolo[3,4-i][1,6]benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid, 2,3,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-1-oxo-, methyl ester, (9S,10R,12R)-(K252a), (5R,6S,8S)-6-hydroxy-5-methyl-13-oxo-6,7,8,13,14,15-hexahydro-5H-16-oxa-4b,8a,14-triaza-5,8-methanodibenzo[b,h]cycloocta[jkl]cyclopenta[e]-as-indacene-6-carboxylic acid (K252b), staurosporine aglycone (K252c), 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), and 4'-N-benzoylstaurosporine (PKC-412). Morphological differentiation, indicated by neurite extension and somal rounding, was quantitatively assessed with NeuronJ. We found that the critical structural component for differentiation in RGC-5 cells is a basic amine adjacent to an accessible methoxy group at the 3' carbon. Given that UCN-01 and similar compounds are potent anticancer drugs, examination of molecules that share similar structural features may yield insights into the design of other drugs for differentiation.

EEG-fMRI of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) usually assumes a fixed hemodynamic response function (HRF). This study investigates HRF variability with respect to IED amplitude fluctuations using independent component analysis (ICA), with the goal of improving the specificity of EEG-fMRI analyses. Methods. We selected EEG-fMRI data from 10 focal epilepsy patients with a good quality EEG. IED amplitudes were calculated in an average reference montage. The fMRI data were decomposed by ICA and a deconvolution method identified IED-related components by detecting time courses with a significant HRF time-locked to the IEDs (F-test, p<0.05). Individual HRF amplitudes were then calculated for each IED. Components with a significant HRF/IED amplitude correlation (Spearman test, p < 0.05) were compared to the presumed epileptogenic focus and to results of a general linear model (GLM) analysis. Results. In 7 patients, at least one IED-related component was concordant with the focus, but many IED-related components were at distant locations. When considering only components with a significant HRF/IED amplitude correlation, distant components could be discarded, significantly increasing the relative proportion of activated voxels in the focus (p = 0.02). In the 3 patients without concordant IED-related components, no HRF/IED amplitude correlations were detected inside the brain. Integrating IED-related amplitudes in the GLM significantly improved fMRI signal modeling in the epileptogenic focus in 4 patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion. Activations in the epileptogenic focus appear to show significant correlations between HRF and IED amplitudes, unlike distant responses. These correlations could be integrated in the analysis to increase the specificity of EEG-fMRI studies in epilepsy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aims of the present study were to: (i) investigate naming abilities and semantic memory in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), early Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to healthy older subjects; (ii) investigate the association between naming and semantic knowledge in aMCI and AD; (iii) examine if the semantic impairment was present in different modalities; and (iv) study the relationship between semantic performance and grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry. Results indicate that both naming and semantic knowledge of objects and famous people were impaired in aMCI and early AD groups, when compared to healthy age- and education-matched controls. Item-by-item analyses showed that anomia in aMCI and early AD was significantly associated with underlying semantic knowledge of famous people but not with semantic knowledge of objects. Moreover, semantic knowledge of the same concepts was impaired in both the visual and the verbal modalities. Finally, voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed that semantic impairment in aMCI and AD was associated with cortical atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) region as well as in the inferior prefrontal cortex (IPC), some of the key regions of the semantic cognition network. These findings suggest that the semantic impairment in aMCI may result from a breakdown of semantic knowledge of famous people and objects, combined with difficulties in the selection, manipulation and retrieval of this knowledge.

To overcome this limitation, we propose to improve VBM by a new approach (called eVBM for enhanced VBM) that takes the histogram distribution of the sMRI into account by adding a histogram equalization step within the VBM procedure. Combining this technique with two most widely used VBM software packages (FSL and SPM), we studied GM variability in a group of 62 patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to 73 age-matched elderly controls. The results show that eVBM can reduce the number of false-positive differences in gray matter concentration. Because it takes advantage of the properties of VBM while improving sMRI histogram distribution at the same time, the proposed method is a powerful approach for analyzing gray matter differences in sMRI and may be of value in the investigation of sMRI gray and white matter abnormalities in a variety of brain diseases.

CDF Collaboration	Measurement of the top quark mass and p(p)over-bar -> t(t)over-bar cross section in the all-hadronic mode with the CDF II detector	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER; PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; PHYSICS; QCD	We present a measurement of the top quark mass and of the top-antitop (t (t) over bar) pair production cross section using p (p) over bar data collected with the CDF II detector at the Tevatron Collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.9 fb(-1). We select events with six or more jets satisfying a number of kinematical requirements imposed by means of a neural-network algorithm. At least one of these jets must originate from a b quark, as identified by the reconstruction of a secondary vertex inside the jet. The mass measurement is based on a likelihood fit incorporating reconstructed mass distributions representative of signal and background, where the absolute jet energy scale ( JES) is measured simultaneously with the top quark mass. The measurement yields a value of 174.8 +/- 2.4(stat + JES)(-1.0)(+1.2)(syst) GeV/c(2), where the uncertainty from the absolute jet energy scale is evaluated together with the statistical uncertainty. The procedure also measures the amount of signal from which we derive a cross section, sigma(t (t$) over bar) = 7.2 +/- 0.5(stat) +/- 1.0(syst) +/- 0.4(lum) pb, for the measured values of top quark mass and JES.

Although it is well documented that mRNAs are transported in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, several of the mechanisms involved in complex formation and localization are poorly understood. Staufen (Stau) 1, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, is a well accepted marker of mRNA transport complexes. In this manuscript, we provide evidence that Stau1 self-associates in live cells using immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays. The double-stranded RNA-binding domains dsRBD3 and dsRBD4 contributed about half of the signal, suggesting that Stau1 RNA-binding activity is involved in Stau1 self-association. Protein-protein interaction also occurred, via dsRBD5 and dsRBD2, as shown by in vitro pull-down, yeast two-hybrid, and BRET assays in live cells. Interestingly, Stau1 self-association contributes to the formation of oligomeric complexes as evidenced by the coexpression of split Renilla luciferase halves covalently linked to Stau1 in a protein complementation assay (PCA) combined with a BRET assay with Stau1-YFP. Moreover, we showed that these higher-order Stau1-containing complexes carry RNAs when the RNA stain SYTO 14 was used as the energy acceptor in the PCA/BRET assay. The oligomeric composition of Stau1-containing complexes and the presence of specific mRNAs have been confirmed by biochemical approaches involving two successive immunoprecipitations of Stau1-tagged molecules followed by qRT-PCR amplification. Altogether, these results indicate that Stau1 self-associates in mRNPs via its multiple functional domains that can select mRNAs to be transported and establish protein-protein interaction.

Methods: The study group consisted of 39 healthy children, aged 7-11 years old. Nightly actigraphic sleep recordings were taken for four consecutive nights to determine habitual week-night sleep duration in the home environment. Objective measures of cognitive functioning and sleepiness were used to measure daytime functioning. Results: Longer habitual sleep duration in healthy school-age participants was associated with better performance on measures of perceptual reasoning and overall IQ, as measured by the WISC-IV, and on reported measures of competence and academic performance. No association between sleep duration and the studied behavioral measures was found. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that sleep duration is differentially related to some components of cognitive functioning, even in the absence of evidence for sleep deprivation or attention deficits.

Adult attachment insecurity and hippocampal cell density	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adult attachment styles; brain; hippocampus cell density; stress; emotion regulation	PITUITARY-ADRENOCORTICAL AXIS; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; MATERNAL-CARE; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTISOL; STRESS; VOLUME	Recent findings associate attachment insecurity (assessed as levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance) with poor emotion regulation. In turn, emotion regulation has been shown to be associated with hippocampus (HC) functioning and structure. Clinical disorders such as depression and PTSD, which have been previously associated with attachment insecurity, are also known to be linked with reduced hippocampal cell density. This suggests that attachment insecurity may also be associated with reduced hippocampal cell density. We examined this hypothesis using T1 images of 22 healthy young adults. In line with our hypothesis, attachment avoidance was associated with bilateral HC reduction, whereas attachment anxiety was significantly related to reduced cell concentration in the left HC. The findings are compatible with a neurotoxical model of stress-induced cell reduction in the HC, providing further information on emotion regulation abilities among insecurely attached individuals.

Case report. Objective. Discuss an isolated intramedullary neurocysticercosis (NCC) case in an adult patient with chronic progressive onset myelopathic symptomatology with clinical, radiologic, and pathologic correlation. Summary of Background Data. NCC is the most common parasitic infection in the central nervous system. Spinal NCC belongs to the group of extraparenchymal forms of NCC and it is considered an extremely rare form characterized by a distinct clinical entity due to mass effect on the spinal cord. Methods. Description of a 62-year-old male patient case who presented with chronic but progressive low cord myelopathy who underwent radiologic investigation through magnetic resonance imaging depicting a thoracic intramedullary cystic lesion at level T11. Results. Surgical excision of the intramedullary lesion was preformed and pathologic study confirmed a cysticercus. There was complete resolution of the neurologic symptoms and follow-up monitoring was unremarkable. Conclusion. Although intramedullary is a rare NCC location, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis in high-risk populations especially when cord compression and myelopathy symptoms are present. Magnetic resonance imaging remains the investigative and follow-up modality of choice, and promptly lesion recognition is fundamental for surgical planning and to improve the patient outcome.

Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) and Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats were bred from Sprague-Dawley (SPD) rats to produce strains with increased (FSL) or decreased (FRL) sensitivity to the cholinesterase inhibitor. The FSL rats have been identified as a good model of depression. Many studies in normal rats showed that chronic treatments with SSRIs reduce the densities of SERT. The objective of the present investigation was to assess the influence of chronic fluoxetine treatment on SERT density (Bmax; fmol/mg) in the FSL rat model of depression, relative to that in the FRL rats and SPD rats. FSL, FRL and SPD rats were randomly assigned into groups receiving the vehicle or 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine i.p. for 14 days. Binding was assessed by incubating the brain sections in a buffer containing 20 pM of [(125)I] -RTI-55 [[(125)I](-)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane and 200 nM of GBR12935 [1-(2-(diphenylmethoxy)ethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine]. The fluoxetine treatment reduced B(max) in all three rat strains when the saline and respective fluoxetine groups were compared (e.g., the FSL-SAL relative to FSL-FLX groups). Chronic fluoxetine treatment reduces the densities of SERT in the FSL rats to a larger extent than in the normal SPD control rats. Synapse 64:231-240, 2010. (C)2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ProNGF induces TNF alpha-dependent death of retinal ganglion cells through a p75(NTR) non-cell-autonomous signaling pathway	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; P75 NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR; NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; OPTIC-NERVE; IN-VIVO; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; MOUSE RETINA; RAT RETINA	Neurotrophin binding to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) activates neuronal apoptosis following adult central nervous system injury, but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly defined. In this study, we show that the proform of nerve growth factor (proNGF) induces death of retinal ganglion cells in adult rodents via a p75(NTR)-dependent signaling mechanism. Expression of p75(NTR) in the adult retina is confined to Muller glial cells; therefore we tested the hypothesis that proNGF activates a non-cell-autonomous signaling pathway to induce retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. Consistent with this, we show that proNGF induced robust expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in Muller cells and that genetic or biochemical ablation of TNF alpha blocked proNGF-induced death of retinal neurons. Mice rendered null for p75(NTR), its coreceptor sortilin, or the adaptor protein NRAGE were defective in proNGF-induced glial TNF alpha production and did not undergo proNGF-induced retinal ganglion cell death. We conclude that proNGF activates a non-cell-autonomous signaling pathway that causes TNF alpha-dependent death of retinal neurons in vivo.

Some functional pain states, i.e. those without a clear and demonstrable pathology, are also more prevalent in women and the pain in these conditions is also modulated by hormonal variations during the menstrual cycle. Increased pain sensitivity is commonly interpreted as the consequence of peripheral or central hyperexcitability of nociceptive pathways. Therefore a role has been suggested for estrogen in the modulation of the excitability of nociceptive afferents and central neurons. The literature on the sign of this modulation is not uniform, with reports pointing to estrogen as either pro- or anti-nociceptive. In our hands, a permanent reduction in the levels of estrogen, such as that induced by surgical ovariectomy (OVX) generates a hyperalgesic state of slow onset and long duration that can be prevented or reversed by exogenous administration of estrogen. The hyperalgesia is characterized by mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in the abdominal and pelvic regions as well as by visceral hypersensitivity. The possible role of estrogen in the prevention of chronic painful states is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This relapse is often provoked by exposure to stress. Stress-induced relapse to drug seeking can be modeled in laboratory animals using a reinstatement procedure. In this procedure, drug-taking behaviors are extinguished and then reinstated by acute exposure to stressors like intermittent unpredictable footshock, restraint, food deprivation, and systemic injections of yohimbine, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist that induces stress-hke responses in humans and nonhumans. For this special issue entitled "The role of neuropeptides in stress and addiction", we review results from studies on the role of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and several other peptides in stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking in laboratory animals. The results of the studies reviewed indicate that extrahypothalamic CRF plays a critical role in stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking; this role is largely independent of drug class, experimental procedure, and type of stressor. There is also limited evidence for the role of dynorphins, hypocretins (orexins), nociceptin (orphanin FQ), and leptin in stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This peptide is one of the most abundant peptides in the central nervous system and is highly conserved throughout evolution. The most abundant receptors of the NPY family, the Y(1) and Y(2) receptors, are densely expressed in the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. These brain regions are particularly associated with mood disorders, stress responses, and memory processing. With this in mind, researchers suggested the involvement of NPY as well as the Y(1) and Y(2) receptors in affective disorders. Earlier studies showed that NPY and the Y(1) and Y(2) receptors mediate some aspects of depression-like disorders and stress responses in rodents. Recent research also suggests the involvement of the Y(4) and Y(5) receptors in emotion-related processes in rodents. In addition, human studies have consistently suggested a role for NPY in stress responses, whereas conflicting data have been obtained in relation to the role of NPY in depression-related illnesses. However, novel evidence from polymorphisms in the prepro-NPY gene has shed new light on the potential clinical relevance of NPY in depression. In this article, we review the literature from both animal and human studies regarding the contribution of NPY and its receptors in depression and stress. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we assess the extent to which this property may be optimized by the concomitant use of conventional antidepressants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We found that, in acute conditions, the 5-HT4 agonist prucalopride was able to counteract the inhibitory effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) fluvoxamine and citalopram on 5-HT neuron impulse flow, in Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) cells selected for their high (>1.8 Hz) basal discharge. The co-administration of both prucalopride and RS 67333 with citalopram for 3 days elicited an enhancement of DRN 5-HT neuron average firing rate, very similar to what was observed with either 5-HT4 agonist alone. At the postsynaptic level, this translated into the manifestation of a tonus on hippocampal postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, that was two to three times stronger when the 5-HT4 agonist was combined with citalopram. Similarly, co-administration of citalopram synergistically potentiated the enhancing effect of RS 67333 on CREB protein phosphorylation within the hippocampus. Finally, in the Forced Swimming Test, the combination of RS 67333 with various SSRIs (fluvoxamine, citalopram and fluoxetine) was more effective to reduce time of immobility than the separate administration of each compound. Conclusions/Significance: These findings strongly suggest that the adjunction of an SSRI to a 5-HT4 agonist may help to optimize the fast-acting antidepressant efficacy of the latter.

Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases (ACAT1 and ACAT2) are two enzymes that convert free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters. ACAT inhibitors have recently emerged as promising drug candidates for AD therapy. However, how ACAT inhibitors act in the brain has so far remained unclear. Here we show that ACAT1 is the major functional isoenzyme in the mouse brain. ACAT1 gene ablation (A1-) in triple transgenic (i.e., 3XTg-AD) mice leads to more than 60% reduction in full-length human APPswe as well as its proteolytic fragments, and ameliorates cognitive deficits. At 4 months of age, A1-causes a 32% content increase in 24-hydroxycholesterol (24SOH), the major oxysterol in the brain. It also causes a 65% protein content decrease in HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) and a 28% decrease in sterol synthesis rate in AD mouse brains. In hippocampal neurons, A1-causes an increase in the 24SOH synthesis rate; treating hippocampal neuronal cells with 24SOH causes rapid declines in hAPP and in HMGR protein levels. A model is provided to explain our findings: in neurons, A1-causes increases in cholesterol and 24SOH contents in the endoplasmic reticulum, which cause reductions in hAPP and HMGR protein contents and lead to amelioration of amyloid pathology. Our study supports the potential of ACAT1 as a therapeutic target for treating certain forms of AD.	[Bryleva, Elena Y.; Rogers, Maximillian A.; Chang, Catherine C.

The activity of LKB1 is greatly enhanced following its association with the Ste20-like adapter protein STRAD. Unlike LKB1 however, mutations in STRAD have not been identified in PJS patients and thus, the key tumour suppressive role(s) of LKB1 might be STRAD independent. Here, we report that Caenorhabditis elegans strd-1/STRAD mutants recapitulate many phenotypes typical of par-4/LKB1 loss of function, showing defects during early embryonic and dauer development. Interestingly, although the growth/proliferation defects in severe par-4 and strd-1 mutant dauers are comparable, strd-1 mutant embryos do not share the polarity defects of par-4 embryos. We demonstrate that most of par-4-dependent regulation of germline stem cell (GSC) quiescence occurs through AMPK, whereby PAR-4 requires STRD-1 to phosphorylate and activate AMPK. Consistent with this, even though AMPK plays a major role in the regulation of cell proliferation, like strd-1 it does not affect embryonic polarity. Instead, we found that the PAR-4-mediated phosphorylation of polarity regulators such as PAR-1 and MEX-5 in the early embryo occurs in the absence of STRD-1. Thus, PAR-4 requires STRD-1 to phosphorylate AMPK to regulate cell growth/proliferation under reduced insulin signalling conditions, whereas PAR-4 can promote phosphorylation of key proteins, including PAR-1 and MEX-5, to specify early embryonic polarity independently of STRD-1. Our results therefore identify a key strd-1/STRAD-independent function of par-4/LKB1 in polarity establishment that is likely to be important for tumour suppression in humans.

We report a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2B7 targeting the juxtamembrane domain of TrkC. mAb 2B7 binds to murine and human TrkC receptors and is a functional agonist that affords activation of TrkC, AKT, and MAPK. These signals result in cell survival but not in cellular differentiation. Monomeric 2B7 Fabs also affords cell survival. Binding of 2B7 mAb and 2B7 Fabs to TrkC are blocked by NT-3 in a dose-dependent manner but not by pro-NT-3. Expression of p75(NTR) coreceptors on the cell surface block the binding and function of mAb 2B7, whereas NT-3 binding and function are enhanced. mAb 2B7 defines a previously unknown neurotrophin receptor functional hot spot; that exclusively generates survival signals; that can be activated by non-dimeric ligands; and potentially unmasks a site for p75-TrkC interactions.

Mutations in the TDP-43 encoding gene, TARDBP, have been subsequently reported in sporadic and familial ALS patients. In order to investigate the pathogenic nature of these mutants, the effects of three consistently reported TARDBP mutations (A315T, G348C and A382T) were tested in cell lines, primary cultured motor neurons and living zebrafish embryos. Each of the three mutants and wild-type (WT) human TDP-43 localized to nuclei when expressed in COS1 and Neuro2A cells by transient transfection. However, when expressed in motor neurons from dissociated spinal cord cultures these mutant TARDBP alleles, but less so for WT TARDBP, were neurotoxic, concomitant with perinuclear localization and aggregation of TDP-43. Finally, overexpression of mutant, but less so of WT, human TARDBP caused a motor phenotype in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos consisting of shorter motor neuronal axons, premature and excessive branching as well as swimming deficits. Interestingly, knock-down of zebrafisfh tardbp led to a similar phenotype, which was rescued by co-expressing WT but not mutant human TARDBP. Together these approaches showed that TARDBP mutations cause motor neuron defects and toxicity, suggesting that both a toxic gain of function as well as a novel loss of function may be involved in the molecular mechanism by which mutant TDP-43 contributes to disease pathogenesis.

The resulting nocifensive behaviors can be divided into two phases differing in timing, duration and underlying mechanisms. Spinal sensitization has long been felt to participate in the second phase of this response, although this sensitization is incompletely understood. By using correlative analysis between spinal gene expression and mouse strain-dependent intensity of late phase behavior, we hypothesized genes participating in variability of the response could be identified. Results: Late phase formalin behavior scores among 10 inbred mouse strains were correlated with a spinal cord gene expression database constructed using expression arrays. Messenger RNA levels for several genes were highly correlated with the late phase behavioral responses. Most of these genes had already been implicated in mechanisms regulating pain and analgesia. One of the most strongly correlated genes, Mapk8 coding for c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), was chosen for further analysis. Studies using additional strains of mice confirmed that spinal cord mRNA expression levels of Mapk8 followed the pattern predicted by strain-specific levels of formalin behavior. Interestingly, spinal cord JNK1 protein levels displayed an inverse relationship with mRNA measurements. Finally, intrathecal injections of the selective JNK inhibitor, SP600125, selectively reduced late phase licking behavior. Conclusions: Wide differences in pain behaviors, including those resulting from the injection of formalin, can be observed in inbred strains of mice suggesting strong genetic influences. Correlating levels of gene expression in tissues established to be mechanistically implicated in the expression of specific behaviors can identify genes involved in the behaviors of interest. Comparing formalin late phase behavior levels with spinal cord gene expression yielded several plausible gene candidates, including the Mapk8 gene. Additional molecular and pharmacologic evidence confirmed a functional role for this gene in supporting formalin late phase responses.	[Li, Xiangqi; Sahbaie, Peyman; Clark, J.

Rfx6 directs islet formation and insulin production in mice and humans	NATURE			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; CONGENITAL MALABSORPTIVE DIARRHEA; AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE SYNDROME; CELL-DIFFERENTIATION; DNA-BINDING; MUTANT NEUROGENIN-3; ENDOCRINE PANCREAS; PRIMARY CILIA; EXPRESSION; REVEALS	Insulin from the beta-cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans controls energy homeostasis in vertebrates, and its deficiency causes diabetes mellitus. During embryonic development, the transcription factor neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) initiates the differentiation of the beta-cells and other islet cell types from pancreatic endoderm, but the genetic program that subsequently completes this differentiation remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Rfx6 directs islet cell differentiation downstream of Neurog3. Mice lacking Rfx6 failed to generate any of the normal islet cell types except for pancreatic-polypeptide-producing cells. In human infants with a similar autosomal recessive syndrome of neonatal diabetes, genetic mapping and subsequent sequencing identified mutations in the human RFX6 gene. These studies demonstrate a unique position for Rfx6 in the hierarchy of factors that coordinate pancreatic islet development in both mice and humans. Rfx6 could prove useful in efforts to generate beta-cells for patients with diabetes.

Attention Differentially Modulates Similar Neuronal Responses Evoked by Varying Contrast and Direction Stimuli in Area MT	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PRIMATE VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NORMALIZATION MODEL; COVERT ATTENTION; V4 NEURONS; MECHANISMS; INCREASES; SENSITIVITY; SELECTIVITY; DEPENDS	The effects of attention on the responses of visual neurons have been described as a scaling or additive modulation independent of stimulus features and contrast, or as a contrast-dependent modulation. We explored these alternatives by recording neuronal responses in macaque area MT to moving stimuli that evoked similar firing rates but varied in contrast and direction. We presented two identical pairs of stimuli, one inside the neurons' receptive field and the other outside, in the opposite hemifield. One stimulus of each pair always had high contrast and moved in the recorded cell's antipreferred direction (AP pattern), while the other (test pattern) could either move in the cell's preferred direction and vary in contrast, or have the same contrast as the AP pattern and vary in direction. For different stimulus pairs evoking similar responses, switching attention between the two AP patterns, or directing attention from a fixation spot to the AP pattern inside or outside the receptive field, produced a stronger suppression of responses to varying contrast pairs, reaching a maximum (similar to 20%) at intermediate contrast. For invariable contrast pairs, switching attention from the fixation spot to the AP pattern produced a modulation that ranged from 10% suppression when the test pattern moved in the cells preferred direction to 14% enhancement when it moved in a direction 90 away from that direction. Our results are incompatible with a scaling or additive modulation of MT neurons' response by attention, but support models where spatial and feature-based attention modulate input signals into the area normalization circuit.

Extra-cellular recordings were carried out in anaesthetized adult Long Evans rats. When stimulated in a noisy environment, most of the neurons remained sensitive to sound direction and only a few changed their optimal direction by more than 15 degrees. When stimulated at their optimal direction in the presence of background noise, a majority of neurons did not modify their response rate, whereas a limited proportion of neurons showed either a significant drop or facilitation of their response rate. Moreover, the neurons' receptive fields showed significant tuning modifications in the presence of background noise. In a noisy environment, the larger receptive fields became narrower, whereas the sharply tuned receptive fields got broader. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we characterize the requirement of Cul-5, a key component of a subgroup of Cullin-RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligases, in Drosophila oogenesis. We find that reduced cul-5 activity causes the formation of aberrant follicles that are characterized by excess germ cells. We show that germ line cells overproliferate in cul-5 mutant females, causing the formation of abnormally large germ line cysts. Also, the follicular epithelium that normally encapsulates single germ line cysts develops aberrantly in cul-5 mutant, leading to defects in cyst formation. We additionally found that Cul-5 is required for germ cell maintenance, as germ cells are depleted in a substantial fraction of cul-5 mutant ovaries. All of these cul-5 phenotypes are strongly enhanced by reduced activity of gustavus (gus), which encodes a substrate receptor of Cul-5-based ubiquitin E3 ligases. Taken together, our results implicate Cul-5/Gus ubiquitin E3 ligases in ovarian tissue morphogenesis, germ cell proliferation and maintenance of the ovarian germ cell population.

Antagonism of Beclin 1-dependent autophagy by BCL-2 at the endoplasmic reticulum requires NAF-1	EMBO JOURNAL			English	Article						autophagy; BCL-2; Beclin 1; BIK; endoplasmic reticulum	INOSITOL 1,4,5-TRISPHOSPHATE RECEPTOR; MITOCHONDRIAL-MEMBRANE PROTEIN; CELL-DEATH; X-L; TRISPHOSPHATE RECEPTOR; BH3-ONLY PROTEIN; DAP-KINASE; BH3 DOMAIN; APOPTOSIS; CALCIUM	In addition to mitochondria, BCL-2 is located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is a constituent of several distinct complexes. Here, we identify the BCL-2-interacting protein at the ER, nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1 (NAF-1)-a bitopic integral membrane protein whose defective expression underlies the aetiology of the neurodegenerative disorder Wolfram syndrome 2 (WFS2). NAF-1 contains a two iron-two sulphur coordinating domain within its cytosolic region, which is necessary, but not sufficient for interaction with BCL-2. NAF-1 is displaced from BCL-2 by the ER-restricted BH3-only protein BIK and contributes to regulation of BIK-initiated autophagy, but not BIK-dependent activation of caspases. Similar to BCL-2, NAF-1 is found in association with the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and is required for BCL-2-mediated depression of ER Ca(2+) stores. During nutrient deprivation as a physiological stimulus of autophagy, BCL-2 is known to function through inhibition of the autophagy effector and tumour suppressor Beclin 1. NAF-1 is required in this pathway for BCL-2 at the ER to functionally antagonize Beclin 1-dependent autophagy. Thus, NAF-1 is a BCL-2-associated co-factor that targets BCL-2 for antagonism of the autophagy pathway at the ER.

Spherical supported bilayer lipid membranes (SS-BLMs) are used here as a novel substrate to demonstrate presynaptic vesicle accumulation at an in vitro synaptic junction. Confocal fluorescence microscopy, cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments have been used to characterize the SS-BLMs. Conventional immunocytochemistry combined with confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to observe the formation of presynaptic vesicles at the neuron-SS-BLM contacts. These results indicate that lipid phases may play a role in the observed phenomenon, in addition to the chemical and electrostatic interactions between the neurons and SS-BLMs. The biocompatibility of lipid bilayers along with their membrane tunability makes the suggested approach a useful "toolkit" for many neuroengineering applications including artificial synapse formation and synaptogenesis in vivo.

Effectiveness of Novel Borane-Phosphine Complexes in Inhibiting Cell Death Depends on the Source of Superoxide Production Induced by Blockade of Mitochondrial Electron Transport	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Superoxide; mitochondria; axonal injury; retinal ganglion cells; sulfhydryl modification	RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; DROSOPHILA MITOCHONDRIA; AXOTOMY; APOPTOSIS; MEMBRANE; SURVIVAL; TOPOLOGY; RELEASE; SIDES; ANION	Central neurons undergo cell death after axotomy. One of the signaling pathways for this process is oxidative modification of one or more critical sulfhydryls in association with superoxide generation within mitochondria. Agents that reduce oxidized sulfhydryls are neuroprotective of axotomized retinal ganglion cells, and we hypothesized that this occurs via reversal of the effects of mitochondrial-produced superoxide. To study this, we measured the ability of the novel borane phosphine complex drugs bis(3-propionic acid methyl ester)phenylphosphine borane complex (PB1) and (3-propionic acid methyl ester)diphenylphosphine borane complex (PB2) to inhibit the death of neuron-like RGC-5 cells induced by perturbation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We found that borane phosphine complexes prevent neuronal cell death from superoxide produced by the redox-cycling agent menadione and the complex III inhibitor antimycin A, which produce superoxide toward the cytoplasm and matrix, but not the complex I inhibitor rotenone, which produces superoxide in the matrix alone. The ability of these disulfide reductants to prevent cell death may be predicted by the topology of superoxide production with respect to the mitochondrial matrix and extramitochondrial space.

Since the discovery of the profound plasticity of the human brain in the late 1990s, this belief has been thoroughly undermined. In this article, combining ethnographic and historical research, I develop an "ethical analysis" to show that (and in what concrete sense) the emergence of adult cerebral plasticity was a major mutation of the neurologically human-a metamorphosis of the confines within which neuroscience requires all those who live under the spell of the brain to think and live the human.

We investigated whether HFOs can delineate epileptogenic areas even outside the SOZ by correlating the resection of HFO-generating areas with surgical outcome. Methods: Twenty patients who underwent a surgical resection for medically intractable epilepsy were studied. All had presurgical intracerebral EEG (500Hz filter and 2,000Hz sampling rate), at least 12-month postsurgical follow-up, and a postsurgical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). HFOs (ripples, 80-250Hz; fast ripples, >250Hz) were identified visually during 5 to 10 minutes of slow-wave sleep. Rates and extent of HFOs and interictal spikes in resected versus nonresected areas, assessed on postsurgical MRIs, were compared with surgical outcome (Engel's classification). We also evaluated the predictive value of removing the SOZ in terms of surgical outcome. Results: The mean duration of follow-up was 22.7 months. Eight patients had good (Engel classes 1 and 2) and 12 poor (classes 3 and 4) surgical outcomes. Patients with a good outcome had a significantly larger proportion of HFO-generating areas removed than patients with a poor outcome. No such difference was seen for spike-generating regions or the SOZ. Interpretation: The correlation between removal of HFO-generating areas and good surgical outcome indicates that HFOs could be used as a marker of epileptogenicity and may be more accurate than spike-generating areas or the SOZ. In patients in whom the majority of HFO-generating tissue remained, a poor surgical outcome occurred.

Unlike the hippocampus, where induction of synaptic plasticity in the network is well-documented in relation to long-term memory, cognitive functions mediated by the PFC have been thought to be independent of long-lasting neuronal adaptation of the network. Nonetheless, accumulating evidence suggests that prefrontal cortical neurons possess the cellular machinery of synaptic plasticity and exhibit lasting changes of neural activity associated with various cognitive processes. Moreover, deficits in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity induction in the PFC might be involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric and neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, drug addiction, mood disorders, and Alzheimer's disease.

It contains axons connecting spatially segregated modules and, as such, it is essential for the smooth flow of information in functional networks. Structural maturation of white matter continues during adolescence, as reflected in age-related changes in its volume, as well as in its microstructure. Here I review recent observations obtained with magnetic resonance imaging in typically developing adolescents and point out some of the known variations in structural properties of white matter vis-A-vis brain function in health and disease. I conclude by refocusing the interpretations of MR-based studies of white matter from myelin to axon. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Treatment of complex regional pain syndrome: a review of the evidence	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article							REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY; SYNDROME TYPE-I; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SPINAL-CORD STIMULATION; ADJUVANT PHYSICAL-THERAPY; SHOULDER-HAND SYNDROME; DOUBLE-BLIND CROSSOVER; OCCUPATIONAL-THERAPY; CLINICAL-TRIAL; SYNDROME TYPE-1	This narrative review summarizes the evidence derived from randomized controlled trials pertaining to the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Using the MEDLINE (January 1950 to April 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2009) databases, the following medical subject headings (MeSH) were searched: "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome", "Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy", and "causalgia" as well as the key words "algodystrophy", "Sudeck's atrophy", "shoulder hand syndrome", "neurodystrophy", "neuroalgodystrophy", "reflex neuromuscular dystrophy", and "posttraumatic dystrophy". Results were limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted on human subjects, written in English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and pertinent to treatment. The search criteria yielded 41 RCTs with a mean of 31.7 subjects per study. Blinded assessment and sample size justification were provided in 70.7% and 19.5% of RCTs, respectively. Only biphosphonates appear to offer clear benefits for patients with CRPS. Improvement has been reported with dimethyl sulfoxide, steroids, epidural clonidine, intrathecal baclofen, spinal cord stimulation, and motor imagery programs, but further trials are required. The available evidence does not support the use of calcitonin, vasodilators, or sympatholytic and neuromodulative intravenous regional blockade. Clear benefits have not been reported with stellate/lumbar sympathetic blocks, mannitol, gabapentin, and physical/occupational therapy. Published RCTs can only provide limited evidence to formulate recommendations for treatment of CRPS. In this review, no study was excluded based on factors such as sample size justification, statistical power, blinding, definition of intervention allocation, or clinical outcomes. Thus, evidence derived from "weaker" trials may be overemphasized. Further well-designed RCTs are warranted.	[Tran, De Q.

Indeed, the mantra that mental disorders are brain disorders is frequently stated and certainly is at least partially true. Yet, the current landslide of information, produced with new extraordinary technologies, has resulted in limited clarity. The area of mental disorders remains laden with deficient, contradictory, and unproven explanations and treatments. One common rationale for this state is the failure to translate new scientific findings into practise. A more defensible and encompassing explanation focuses on the very basic conceptualizations and definitions of these disorders. Patently powerful methodologies can be no better or worse than the clarity of the problems under study. Numerous examples of definitional and diagnostic problems exist that have led to the lack of clarity and application of research findings. Alternative research strategies are discussed with a focus on the high-risk paradigm. A series of studies of a single characteristic of individuals at risk for problems with alcohol is presented.

Considerations for Prenatal Counselling of Patients with Cardiac Rhabdomyomas based on their Cardiac and Neurologic Outcomes	CARDIOLOGY IN THE YOUNG			English	Article						Cardiac tumour; fetus; outcome; tuberous sclerosis	TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS COMPLEX; FETAL RHABDOMYOMA; NATURAL-HISTORY; TUMORS; DIAGNOSIS; EXPERIENCE; BENIGN; TRACT; FETUS	Cardiac rhabdomyomas are benign cardiac tumours with few cardiac complications, but with a known association to tuberous sclerosis that affects the neurologic outcome of the patients. We have analysed the long-term cardiac and neurological outcomes of patients with cardiac rhabdomyomas in order to allow comprehensive prenatal counselling, basing our findings on the records of all patients seen prenatally and postnatally with an echocardiographic diagnosis of cardiac rhabdomyoma encountered from August, 1982, to September, 2007. We analysed factors such as the number and the location of the tumours to establish their association with a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis, predicting the cardiac and neurologic outcomes for the patients. Cardiac complications include arrhythmias, obstruction of the ventricular outflow tracts, and secondary cardiogenic shock. Arrhythmias were encountered most often during the neonatal period, with supraventricular tachycardia being the commonest rhythm disturbance identified. No specific dimension or location of the cardiac rhabdomyomas predicted the disturbances of rhythm. The importance of the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is exemplified by the neurodevelopmental complications, with four-fifths of the patients showing epilepsy, and two-thirds having delayed development. The presence of multiple cardiac tumours suggested a higher risk of being affected by tuberous sclerosis. The tumours generally regress after birth, and cardiac-related problems are rare after the perinatal period. Tuberous sclerosis and the associated neurodevelopmental complications dominate the clinical picture, and should form an important aspect of the prenatal counselling of parents.

Structural and functional neuroprotection in glaucoma: role of galantamine-mediated activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Article						retinal ganglion cell; glaucoma; acetylcholinesterase; muscarinic	RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; NICOTINIC RECEPTOR; OPTIC-NERVE; IN-VIVO; AMYLOID-BETA; RAT MODEL; NEURONS; INHIBITION; PHARMACOKINETICS; IDENTIFICATION	Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Loss of vision due to glaucoma is caused by the selective death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Treatments for glaucoma, limited to drugs or surgery to lower intraocular pressure (IOP), are insufficient. Therefore, a pressing medical need exists for more effective therapies to prevent vision loss in glaucoma patients. In this in vivo study, we demonstrate that systemic administration of galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, promotes protection of RGC soma and axons in a rat glaucoma model. Functional deficits caused by high IOP, assessed by recording visual evoked potentials from the superior colliculus, were improved by galantamine. These effects were not related to a reduction in IOP because galantamine did not change the pressure in glaucomatous eyes and it promoted neuronal survival after optic nerve axotomy, a pressure-independent model of RGC death. Importantly, we demonstrate that galantamine-induced ganglion cell survival occurred by activation of types M1 and M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, while nicotinic receptors were not involved. These data provide the first evidence of the clinical potential of galantamine as neuroprotectant for glaucoma and other optic neuropathies, and identify muscarinic receptors as potential therapeutic targets for preventing vision loss in these blinding diseases.

Neu1 desialylation of sialyl alpha-2,3-linked beta-galactosyl residues of TOLL-like receptor 4 is essential for receptor activation and cellular signaling	CELLULAR SIGNALLING			English	Article						Cell signaling; Receptor activation; Sialic acid; TOLL-like receptor; Trypanosome trans-sialidase; Cellular sialidase; Glycosylation	VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; NF-KAPPA-B; TRANS-SIALIDASE; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; GLYCAN INTERACTIONS; EXOGENOUS ANTIGENS; SURFACE EXPRESSION; TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; CLASS-I	The ectodomain of TOLL-like receptors (TLR) is highly glycosylated with several N-linked gylcosylation sites located in the inner concave surface. The precise role of these sugar N-glycans in TLR receptor activation is unknown. Recently, we have shown that Neu1 sialidase and not Neu 2,-3 and -4 forms a complex with TLR-2,-3 and -4 receptors on the cell-surface membrane of naive and activated macrophage cells (Glycoconj J DOI 10.1007/s10719-009-9239-8). Activation of Neu1 is induced by TLR ligands binding to their respective receptors. Here, we show that endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced MyD88/TLR4 complex formation and subsequent NF kappa B activation is dependent on the removal of alpha-2,3-sialyl residue linked to beta-galactoside of TLR4 by the Neu1 activity associated with LPS-stimulated live primary macrophage cells, macrophage and dendritic cell lines but not with primary Neu1-deficient macrophage cells. Exogenous alpha-2,3 sialyl specific neuraminidase (Streptoccocus pneumoniae) and wild-type T cruzi trans-sialidase (TS) but not the catalytically inactive mutant TS Delta Asp98-Glu mediate TLR4 dimerization to facilitate MyD88/TLR4 complex formation and NF kappa B activation similar to those responses seen with LPS. These same TLR ligand-induced NF kappa B responses are not observed in TLR deficient HEK293 cells, but are re-established in HEK293 cells stably transfected with TLR4/MD2, and are significantly inhibited by alpha-2,3-siallyl specific Maacida amurensis (MAL-2) lectin, alpha-2,3-sialyl specific galectin-1 and neuraminidase inhibitor Tamiflu but not by alpha-2,6-sialyl specific Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA). Taken together, the findings suggest that Neu1 desialylation of alpha-2,3-sialyl residues of TLR receptors enables in removing a steric hinderance to receptor association for TLR activation and cellular signaling.

Various regimens have explored the addition of newer agents to determine safety and efficacy. The aim of this phase II study was to incorporate albumin-bound paclitaxel with sequential anthracycline-based therapy. Patents and Methods: Sixty-six women with LABC but without prior treatment and regardless of hormone receptor or HER2 status were enrolled. All patients were to receive albumin-bound paclitaxel weekly for 12 weeks followed by 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Trastuzumab was allowed in HER2-positive (HER2(+)) patients. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR; CR) in breast. Secondary endpoints included pCR in breast and nodes, clinical CR, 2-year progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: Sixty-five patients received at least 1 dose of chemotherapy and were included in this analysis. Sixty-three patients completed 4 cycles of albumin-bound paclitaxel. Sixty-two patients received at least 1 dose of FEC, and 58 completed 4 cycles. Seventeen of 19 HER2(+) women received trastuzumab. The pCR in breast was 29% (19 of 65). For the HER2(+) subset, the pCR was 58% (11 of 19). Both albumin-bound paclitaxel and FEC were well tolerated. The most significant toxicities were grade 2/3 neuropathy (16%) with albumin-bound paclitaxel and grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia (7%) with FEC. Conclusion: Albumin-bound paclitaxel given over 12 weeks is well tolerated. Albumin-bound paclitaxel should be further evaluated in a randomized setting in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant trials.

These developmental cystic lesionsare generally located in the posterior mediastinum, abdomen, and pelvis and may also contain some mesodermal and neuroectodermal elements. In contrast, neurenteric cysts of the central nervous system are very infrequent and occur most commonly in the spinal canal. Intraspinal neurenteric cysts are usually encountered in the cervicothoracic region with an intradural, extramedullary location and are commonly associated with congenital defects of the overlying skin and/or vertebral bodies. Intracranial neurenteric cysts are very uncommon and typically located in the posterior fossa. Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain the origin of intracranial neurenteric cysts. However, the embryologic basis of these fascinating lesions remains incompletely understood. Supratentorial neurenteric cysts are distinctly rare often represent a diagnostic challenge on preoperative neuroimaging. In fact, only 22 cases of supratentorial neurenteric cysts have been reported in the literature including our own patient with a laterally based convexity extraaxial cyst presenting with seizures. In this report, we review the clinical, radiographic, and histological findings of supratentorial neurenteric cysts. We discuss the differential diagnoses and surgical considerations in the management of these intriguing lesions. We also provide an extensive review of normal human embryogenesis and discuss putative mechanisms of embryopathogenesis of supratentorial neurenteric cysts. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: ASSR in the 40-Hz range were recorded in 15 adults using the frequency tagging method while subjects detected a carrier frequency change in amplitude-modulated tones. Spectral and temporal domain analyses were performed to examine the effect on response amplitudes during attending to the tones compared to ignoring them for both monaural and dichotic stimulations. Results: Larger responses were found in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated ear. Binaural suppression for ipsilateral input was found in both hemispheres. Time series of the source waveforms were calculated from equivalent current dipoles and showed a 2 Hz beat for the dichotic presentation. Attention to carrier frequency change was significant only during dichotic presentation where larger right hemisphere responses were found at the onset of carrier change. Conclusions: Attending to carrier frequency change in stimulation enhances the right hemisphere ASSR amplitude for dichotic stimulation. Significance: The possibility of tagging frequency specific responses up to auditory cortex makes the ASSR approach interesting for studying hearing impairment mechanisms, integrity of auditory structures and attention.

Usually, hypometabolism is demonstrated on the F18 FDG PET and hyperperfusion in the same region on the Tc-99m ECD ictal SPECT. The authors report a rare occurrence of left frontal hypermetabolism in a young girl with multiple recurring epileptic seizures, on F18-FDG PET, which was confirmed on ictal Tc-99m ECD SPECT. The patient's seizures were characterized by head deviation and movements of the upper extremities. The seizures were occurring non stop every 3 to 5 minutes, even during imaging, lasting about 15 seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed evidence of dysplastic cortex which was consistent with the focal abnormalities on PET and SPECT.

Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Setting: Three academic medical centers. Patients: Thirty-six adult intensive care unit patients with delirium (intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score >= 4), tolerating enteral nutrition, and without a complicating neurologic condition. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive quetiapine 50 mg every 12 hrs or placebo. Quetiapine was increased every 24 hrs (50 to 100 to 150 to 200 mg every 12 hrs) if more than one dose of haloperidol was given in the previous 24 hrs. Study drug was continued until the intensive care unit team discontinued it because of delirium resolution, therapy >= 10 days, or intensive care unit discharge. Measurements and Main Results: Baseline characteristics were similar between the quetiapine (n = 18) and placebo (n = 18) groups. Quetiapine was associated with a shorter time to first resolution of delirium [1.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.5-3.0) vs. 4.5 days (IQR, 2.0-7.0; p = .001)], a reduced duration of delirium [36 (IQR, 12-87) vs. 120 hrs (IQR, 60-195; p = .006)], and less agitation (Sedation-Agitation Scale score >= 5) [6 (IQR, 0-38) vs. 36 hrs (IQR, 11-66; p = .02)]. Whereas mortality (11% quetiapine vs. 17%) and intensive care unit length of stay (16 quetiapine vs. 16 days) were similar, subjects treated with quetiapine were more likely to be discharged home or to rehabilitation (89% quetiapine vs. 56%; p = .06). Subjects treated with quetiapine required fewer days of as-needed haloperidol [3 [(IQR, 2-4)] vs. 4 days (IQR, 3-8; p = .05)]. Whereas the incidence of QTc prolongation and extrapyramidal symptoms was similar between groups, more somnolence was observed with quetiapine (22% vs. 11%; p = .66). Conclusions: Quetiapine added to as-needed haloperidol results in faster delirium resolution, less agitation, and a greater rate of transfer to home or rehabilitation. Future studies should evaluate the effect of quetiapine on mortality, resource utilization, post-intensive care unit cognition, and dependency after discharge in a broader group of patients.

Increasing the level of pressure support ventilation can increase tidal volume, reduce respiratory rate, and lead to delayed ventilator triggering and cycling. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist uses diaphragm electrical activity to control the timing and pressure of assist delivery and is expected to enhance patient-ventilator synchrony. Design: Prospective, comparative, crossover study. Setting: Adult critical care unit in a tertiary university hospital. Patients: Fourteen nonsedated mechanically ventilated patients (n = 12 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Interventions: Patients were ventilated for 10-min periods, using two pressure support ventilation levels (lowest tolerable and +7 cm H(2)O higher) and two neurally adjusted ventilatory assist levels (same peak pressures and external positive end-expiratory pressure as with pressure support ventilation), delivered in a randomized order. Measurements and Main Results: Diaphragm electrical activity, respiratory pressures, air flow, volume, neural and ventilator respiratory rates, and arterial blood gases were measured. Peak pressures were 17 +/- 6 cm H(2)O and 24 +/- 6 cm H(2)O and 19 +/- 5 cm H(2)O and 24 +/- 6 cm H(2)O with high and low pressure support ventilation and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist, respectively. The breathing pattern was comparable with pressure support ventilation and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist during low assist; during higher assist, larger tidal volumes (p = .003) and lower breathing frequencies (p = .008) were observed with pressure support ventilation. Increasing the assist increased cycling delays only with pressure support ventilation (p = .003). Compared with pressure support ventilation, neurally adjusted ventilatory assist reduced delays of ventilator triggering (p < .001 for low and high assist) and cycling (high assist: p = .004; low assist: p = .04), and abolished wasted inspiratory efforts observed with pressure support ventilation in six subjects. The diaphragm electrical activity and pressure-time product for ventilator triggering were lower with neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (p = .005 and p = .02, respectively; analysis of variance). Arterial blood gases were similar with both modes. Conclusions: Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist can improve patient-ventilator synchrony by reducing the triggering and cycling delays, especially at higher levels of assist, at the same time preserving breathing and maintaining blood gases.

Given reports of gray matter differences in meditators as well as between chronic pain patients and controls, the present study investigated whether differences in brain morphometry are associated with the low pain sensitivity observed in Zen practitioners. Structural MRI scans were performed and the temperature required to produce moderate pain was assessed in 17 meditators and 18 controls. Meditators had significantly lower pain sensitivity than controls. Assessed across all subjects, lower pain sensitivity was associated with thicker cortex in affective, pain-related brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral para-hippocampal gyrus and anterior insula. Comparing groups, meditators were found to have thicker cortex in the dorsal anterior cingulate and bilaterally in secondary somatosensory cortex. More years of meditation experience was associated with thicker gray matter in the anterior cingulate, and hour of experience predicted more gray matter bilaterally in the lower leg area of the primary somatosensory cortex as well as the hand area in the fight hemisphere. Results generally suggest that pain sensitivity is related to cortical thickness in pain-related brain regions and that the lower sensitivity observed in meditators may be the product of alterations to brain morphometry from long-term practice.

We had the unique opportunity to record a seizure in EEG with intracerebral macroelectrodes and a sampling frequency of 10 kHz. Considering the notion that faster HFOs are likely more ictogenic, we investigated this ictal EEG data to find if even faster HFOs were present. HFOs were investigated in interictal spikes and seizure activity using time-frequency spectra: t values corresponding to frequencies from 100 to 1000 Hz were obtained by comparison to the background and controlled by the false discovery rate (FDR). The seizure had a right hippocampal onset. HFOs up to 800 Hz as well as HFOs below 500 Hz built up in the hippocampal discharges more at the beginning of the seizure and during the preictal period than in the interictal period. These HFOs were visually confirmed in temporally expanded EEG traces. We demonstrated for the first time the existence of HFOs above 500 Hz and up to 800 Hz with intracerebral macroelectrodes in an epileptic patient; they occurred primarily in association with the seizure discharge. HFOs above 500 Hz possibly reflect facilitation of ictogenic neuronal hypersynchronization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LEPs are to date the reference standard technique for studying nociceptive pathway function in patients with neuropathic pain. To find out whether LEPs also provide a useful neurophysiological tool for assessing antinociceptive drug efficacy, in this double-blind placebo-controlled study we measured changes induced by the analgesic tramadol on LEPs in 12 healthy subjects. We found that tramadol decreased the amplitude of LEPs, whereas placebo left LEPs unchanged. The opioid antagonist naloxone partially reversed the tramadol-induced LEP amplitude decrease. We conclude that LEPs may be reliably used in clinical practice and research for assessing the efficacy of antinociceptive drugs.

The on-cells of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) play an important role in descending nociceptive facilitation and can be sensitized to somatic mechanical stimulation following peripheral nerve injury or hindpaw inflammation. Here we have tested the hypothesis that visceral noxious stimulation sensitizes RVM ON-like cells, thus promoting an enhanced descending facilitation that can lead to referred visceral hyperalgesia. Intracolonic capsaicin instillation (ICI) was applied to rats in order to create a hyperalgesic state dependent on noxious visceral stimulation. This instillation produced acute pain-related behaviors and prolonged referred hyperalgesia that were prevented by the RVM microinjection of AP5, an NMDA selective antagonist. In electrophysiological experiments, ON-like RVM neurons showed ongoing spontaneous activity following ICI that lasted for similar to 20 min and an enhanced responsiveness to von Frey and heat stimulation of the hindpaw and to colorectal distention (CRD) that lasted for at least 50 min post capsaicin administration. Moreover, ON-like cells acquired a novel response to CRD and responded to heat stimulation in the innocuous range. OFF-like neurons responded to capsaicin administration with a brief (<5 min) inhibition of activity followed by an enhanced inhibition to noxious stimulation and a novel inhibition to innocuous stimulation (CRD and heat) at early time points (10 min post capsaicin). These results support the hypothesis that noxious visceral stimulation may cause referred hypersensitivity by promoting long-lasting sensitization of RVM ON-like cells.

We used an extended version of the Sniffin' Sticks test to assess olfactory function, including odor threshold, concentration discrimination, quality discrimination, and odor identification. We observed a correlation between olfactory performance and cortical thickness of structures involved in earlier and later stages of chemosensory processing such as right medial orbitofrontal cortex, right insula, and adjacent cortex. Furthermore, we found significant bilateral correlations of olfactory performance with cortical thickness of areas around the central sulcus bilaterally, structures responsible for voluntary respiration and sniffing. In addition to expected general sex effects on cortical thickness, we observed areas, such as the entorhinal cortex, occipital cortex, intraparietal sulcus and insula (all in the right hemisphere), where the correlation between higher order olfactory functions and cortical thickness differed between women and men. These data demonstrate, for some neuroanatomical structures, a link between cortical thickness and olfactory function, in that thicker cortex is usually associated with better performance, but not always. This association between anatomy and olfactory performance suggests a possible biological explanation for the high degree of individual differences and sex effects observed in higher order olfactory tasks.

Reach-to-grasp movement as a minimization process	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Goal-directed actions; Inter-joint coordination; Referent arm configuration; Minimization principles; Sensory-motor integration; Equilibrium-point hypothesis; Modules; Synergies	MAGNOCELLULAR RED NUCLEUS; PREHENSION MOVEMENTS; MOTOR CONTROL; APERTURE CLOSURE; HAND TRANSPORT; ARM MOVEMENTS; REMEMBERED TARGETS; TEMPORAL CONTROL; DECEREBRATE CAT; STRETCH REFLEX	It is known that hand transport and grasping are functionally different but spatially coordinated components of reach-to-grasp (RTG) movements. As an extension of this notion, we suggested that body segments involved in RTG movements are controlled as a coherent ensemble by a global minimization process associated with the necessity for the hand to reach the motor goal. Different RTG components emerge following this process without pre-programming. Specifically, the minimization process may result from the tendency of neuromuscular elements to diminish the spatial gap between the actual arm-hand configuration and its virtual (referent) configuration specified by the brain. The referent configuration is specified depending on the object shape, localization, and orientation. Since the minimization process is gradual, it can be interrupted and resumed following mechanical perturbations, at any phase during RTG movements, including hand closure. To test this prediction of the minimization hypothesis, we asked subjects to reach and grasp a cube placed within the reach of the arm. Vision was prevented during movement until the hand returned to its initial position. As predicted, by arresting wrist motion at different points of hand transport in randomly selected trials, it was possible to halt changes in hand aperture at any phase, not only during hand opening but also during hand closure. Aperture changes resumed soon after the wrist was released. Another test of the minimization hypothesis was made in RTG movements to an object placed beyond the reach of the arm. It has previously been shown (Rossi et al. in J Physiol 538:659-671, 2002) that in such movements, the trunk motion begins to contribute to hand transport only after a critical phase when the shifts in the referent arm configuration have finished (at about the time when hand velocity is maximal). The minimization rule suggests that when the virtual contribution of the arm to hand transport is completed, guidance of hand aperture switches from the arm to the trunk control system. As a consequence, hand aperture changes can be halted by trunk arrests but only if they are prolonged beyond a critical phase. As predicted, hand transport and hand aperture in RTG movements beyond the reach of the arm were halted by trunk arrests only if they were prolonged beyond the time of peak hand velocity. Hand motion and aperture changes resumed only when the trunk was released. While supporting the minimization hypothesis, our findings imply that not only spatial but also temporal characteristics of each component, including the shortest, hand closure component of RTG movements, are controlled in a flexible, task-specific way.

Twenty-eight females were randomly allocated to wear ALD tape continuously or a no-tape control for a mean 12 +/- 2 days. Electromyographic activity from 12 lower limb muscles, three-dimensional motion at the ankle, knee, hip and pelvis (i.e., measures of neuromotor control) and foot posture and mobility was measured before and after the tape or control interventions. For the tape group, arch height ratio (=arch height/distance from heel to first metatarsophalangeal joint line) was greater by 0.006 (95% confidence interval: 0.0002-0.01, p = 0.04) following the intervention period, whereas no change was observed for the control group (-0.003 (-0.01-0.004), p = 0.36). The difference between groups (0.009 (0.0004-0.02), p = 0.04) equated to a 0.16 cm increase in arch height for the tape group following continual use of ALD tape. There was no change in neuromotor control of gait following continual use of ALD taping (p > 0.05). Continual use of ALD tape for approximately 12 days produced a small change in foot posture, but no alteration in neuromotor control. Previous literature suggests that this increase in arch height is likely to be clinically relevant and may be one factor that contributes to the known efficiency of ALD tape in the treatment of lower extremity pain and injury.

Ovariectomized, hormone-primed Long-Evans rats were randomly assigned to receive either distributed CLS (1 stimulation every 5 s for 1 min prior to being placed in one distinctive side of a nonbiased CPP box for 2 min, after which the cycle of stimulation and CPP exposure were repeated for 4 more cycles, totaling 60 stimulations) or.continuous CLS (1 stimulation per second for 1 min with 2 min in one side of the CPP box, repeated for 4 more cycles, totaling 300 stimulations). Two days later, females were placed into the other side of the CPP box without prior stimulation. CPP was tested after 5 sequential exposures each of CLS and no stimulation. Females given distributed stimulation developed a significant CPP whereas females given continuous stimulation did not. CLS induced Fos in hypothalamic and limbic structures, including the nucleus accumbens, piriform cortex, arcuate nucleus, and dorsomedial portion of the ventromedial hypothalamus, compared to no stimulation. However, distributed CLS induced more Fos in the medial preoptic area than continuous CLS or no stimulation. In contrast, continuous CLS induced more Fos in the posteroventral medial amygdala compared to no stimulation. These data indicate that CLS induces a reward state in the rat and a pattern of Fos activation in regions of the brain that process genitosensory input, incentive salience, and reward.

J	Djioua, M; Plamondon, R				Djioua, Moussa; Plamondon, Rejean			The limit profile of a rapid movement velocity	HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Delta-Lognormal model; Kinematic Theory; Minimum-Jerk; Minimum principles; Minimum-Time; Motor control	KINEMATIC THEORY; ARM MOVEMENTS; GENERATION; MODEL; TRAJECTORIES; REPRESENTATION; PRINCIPLES; TIME; LAW	In motor control, various theories and computational models have been developed to explain and model the stereotypical velocity profiles of skilled rapid movements. According to the fact that these theories aim at describing the same physical pattern (a velocity profile) with different mathematical expressions, some relationships between these various representation schemes should exist. This paper presents a comparative study of two motor control theories that have put forward analytical expressions to describe the stereotypical velocity profiles of rapid movements: the Kinematic Theory and the Minimization Theory. Among the various forms of the latter, the Minimum-Square-Derivatives (MSD) principle and the Minimum-Time model are analyzed. It is shown that their concepts are linked and describe, with different arguments, a paradigm similar to the one used in the Kinematic Theory to model a velocity profile with a Delta-Lognormal equation. This unifying paradigm represents the functioning of a neuromuscular system by the convolution product of an infinite number of subsystem impulse responses. A second finding emerging from the present study is that the analytical models of velocity profiles, as described by the minimum principles under study, correspond, with more or less accuracy, to an approximation of the Delta-Lognormal equation. Overall, the Kinematic Theory can be seen as relying on a general optimization principle and the use of the Minimization Theory in motor control gets new insights. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The system is compact and uses only four circularly polarized patch elements. A printed beamforming network is used to create a set of partially overlapping beams allowing DOA estimation without ambiguity. Neural networks are used to first classify the antenna signals and then estimate the DOA. The proposed system was validated experimentally in C band and, in spite of the highly disturbed beams caused by the finite size of the antenna platform, it was shown that DOA estimation errors in the order of one degree were achievable under signal-to-noise ratios of 10 dB.

Women may present differently than men, and the classic findings of snoring, witnessed apnoeas and sleepiness may not be observed. Factors which predispose to OSA include polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, retromicrognathia, and hypothyroidism. OSA may contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction, depression, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Emerging evidence indicates that snoring and OSA increase during pregnancy. For normal women with normotensive, low-risk pregnancies the prevalence of OSA is very low. Among normotensive pregnant women with high risk pregnancies, the prevalence of OSA is high and is even higher among those with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia during pregnancy. Incident snoring, which is a marker for OSA, is associated with an increased risk of developing gestational hypertension. Recent studies indicate that OSA per se is an independent risk factor for gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and may contribute to other poor obstetrical outcomes. The diagnostic test of choice for OSA is a polysomnography with electroencephalogram. Milder degree of disease than what is usually considered clinically significant among men or non-pregnant women appears to be relevant for foetomaternal outcomes. There seems to be benefit for blood pressure control to treating even milder degrees of OSA with CPAP, both acutely and over the 9 months of pregnancy. Chronic hypertensive women should be strongly considered for diagnosis and treatment of OSA prior to or beginning as early as possible in pregnancy to help maintain blood pressure control. Increasing awareness of OSA among maternal health care providers is important given the potential benefits for pregnancy and other health-related outcomes associated with identification and treatment of OSA.

In a previous study, we designed a paradigm to study only the processing of new information. The processing of context was eased in the hope that patients would perform it as normals do. The goal of the present work was to determine whether this was the case. To achieve this goal, the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by the two context words of the new protocol were examined in 35 schizophrenia patients and 30 normal controls. These two context words were 'INACTION' and 'ANIMAL?'. Each trial started by one or the other and continued with a target word. 'INACTION' announced that subjects had no decision to make for the target word. 'ANIMAL?' announced that subjects had to decide whether or not the target word could be integrated into the animal category. Two ERP differences were found between normals and patients. However, the first, for 'INACTION', could be related to patients' difficulties at inhibiting the planning of action and the second, for 'ANIMAL?', to the preparation of their motor responses. No ERP difference was found that could have indexed a problem in encoding or in maintaining context. Thus, we conclude that this particular type of protocol could be helpful to focus on the study of the processing of the new semantic information conveyed by target words. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nielsen, T				Nielsen, Tore			Nightmares Associated with the Eveningness Chronotype	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS			English	Article						chronotype; eveningness; nightmares; parasomnias; gender; age; sleep duration	MORNINGNESS-EVENINGNESS; OSTBERG QUESTIONNAIRE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; SLEEP DISTURBANCES; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; YOUNG-ADULTS; PREVALENCE; PREFERENCE; PHASE; HORNE	Relations between common nightmares and chronobiological factors remain poorly understood. The possibility that nightmare frequency and distress are associated with chronotype ("morningness-eveningness") was investigated in a sample of respondents to an Internet questionnaire. Over a 4-year period, a total of 3978 subjects (mean age = 26.5 +/- 11.6 yrs; age range = 10-69; 2933 female, 1045 male) submitted responses to single items about chronotype and nightmares as well as to other demographic variables. Analyses of chronotype and nightmares items by age and gender replicated most previous findings for these measures-validating their further assessment-and uncovered abrupt increases in nightmare distress between ages 10-19 and 20-29 for females and ages 30-39 and 40-49 for males. Most important, there was a strong association between nightmares and eveningness for female subjects. The latter was expressed as a linear association between nightmare frequency and increasing eveningness and a cubic association between nightmare distress and increasing eveningness; the definite evening types displayed the most severe nightmares. The effect for nightmare frequency was independent of age and sleep duration but was eliminated when nightmare distress was covaried. For females, the nightmare/eveningness association appeared at ages 20 to 29 for the definite evening type and only later, at ages 30 to 39, for the moderate evening type. Findings are consistent with the possibility that nightmares are the expression of a more general pathological factor that is characteristic of eveningness and that is responsible for affective symptoms such as neuroticism and depression. This pathological factor appears to be expressed in late adolescence/early adulthood, and relative morningness may be a protective factor delaying its onset. The well-established circadian modulations of cognitive, social, and affective tasks that are influenced by chronotype may extend to the memory and affective processes of sleep-including dreaming.

Novel Staufen1 ribonucleoproteins prevent formation of stress granules but favour encapsidation of HIV-1 genomic RNA	JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE			English	Article						Staufen1; HIV-1; Staufen1 HIV-1-dependent RNP; SHRNP; siRNA; Ribonucleoprotein; RNA encapsidation; Virus-host interaction; AIDS; Intracellular traffic	IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1; BINDING PROTEIN STAUFEN2; MESSENGER-RNA; P-BODIES; GAG POLYPROTEIN; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; BODY FORMATION; TRANSLATION; COMPLEXES; TRANSPORT	Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag selects for and mediates genomic RNA (vRNA) encapsidation into progeny virus particles. The host protein, Staufen1 interacts directly with Gag and is found in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing vRNA, which provides evidence that Staufen1 plays a role in vRNA selection and encapsidation. In this work, we show that Staufen1, vRNA and Gag are found in the same RNP complex. These cellular and viral factors also colocalize in cells and constitute novel Staufen1 RNPs (SHRNPs) whose assembly is strictly dependent on HIV-1 expression. SHRNPs are distinct from stress granules and processing bodies, are preferentially formed during oxidative stress and are found to be in equilibrium with translating polysomes. Moreover, SHRNPs are stable, and the association between Staufen1 and vRNA was found to be evident in these and other types of RNPs. We demonstrate that following Staufen1 depletion, apparent supraphysiologic-sized SHRNP foci are formed in the cytoplasm and in which Gag, vRNA and the residual Staufen1 accumulate. The depletion of Staufen1 resulted in reduced Gag levels and deregulated the assembly of newly synthesized virions, which were found to contain several-fold increases in vRNA, Staufen1 and other cellular proteins. This work provides new evidence that Staufen1-containing HIV-1 RNPs preferentially form over other cellular silencing foci and are involved in assembly, localization and encapsidation of vRNA.

However, a proper representation of elapsed time and of the exact task is usually required for the model to work. Most models use timing elements such as delay-line representations of time that are not biologically realistic for intervals in the range of seconds. The interval-timing literature provides several alternatives. One of them is that timing could emerge from general network dynamics, instead of coming from a dedicated circuit. Here, we present a general rate-based learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks that learns a time representation when needed. Using a na < ve network learning its environment in conjunction with TD, we reproduce dopamine activity in appetitive trace conditioning with a constant CS-US interval, including probe trials with unexpected delays. The proposed model learns a representation of the environment dynamics in an adaptive biologically plausible framework, without recourse to delay lines or other special-purpose circuits. Instead, the model predicts that the task-dependent representation of time is learned by experience, is encoded in ramp-like changes in single-neuron activity distributed across small neural networks, and reflects a temporal integration mechanism resulting from the inherent dynamics of recurrent loops within the network. The model also reproduces the known finding that trace conditioning is more difficult than delay conditioning and that the learned representation of the task can be highly dependent on the types of trials experienced during training. Finally, it suggests that the phasic dopaminergic signal could facilitate learning in the cortex.

JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						deep architectures; unsupervised pre-training; deep belief networks; stacked denoising auto-encoders; non-convex optimization	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CONTRASTIVE DIVERGENCE; DIMENSIONALITY	Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants, with impressive results obtained in several areas, mostly on vision and language data sets. The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difficult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pretraining guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.

Effect of the Stimulation of Sensory Inputs on the Firing of Neurons of the Trigeminal Main Sensory Nucleus in the Rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PERSISTENT SODIUM CURRENT; CORD IN-VITRO; SPINAL-CORD; BRAIN-STEM; EXTRACELLULAR CALCIUM; BURST GENERATION; MOTOR NUCLEUS; HYPOGLOSSAL NUCLEI; PATTERN GENERATION; LOCOMOTOR PATTERN	Bernier AP, Arsenault I, Lund JP, Kolta A. Effect of the stimulation of sensory inputs on the firing of neurons of the trigeminal main sensory nucleus in the rat. J Neurophysiol 103: 915-923, 2010. First published December 2, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.91109.2008. Mastication can be triggered by repetitive stimulation of the cortex or of sensory inputs, but is patterned by a brain stem central pattern generator (CPG). This CPG may include the dorsal part of the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus (NVsnpr), where neurons burst repetitively when the extracellular concentration of Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](e)) drops. We examined the effects of repetitive stimulation of sensory afferents of the trigeminal tract on activity of NVsnpr neurons recorded extracellularly in vitro under physiologic [Ca(2+)](e) (1.6 mM). Spontaneously active cells had either a tonic (n = 145) or a bursting (n = 46) firing pattern. Afferent stimulation altered burst duration and/or burst frequency in bursting cells and firing frequency in most tonic cells. In 28% of the latter, the firing pattern switched to rhythmic bursting. This effect could be mimicked by local application of N-methyl-D-aspartate and blocked by APV but not DNQX. Detailed analysis showed that rhythm indices (RIs) of 35 tonic neurons that were negative (nonrhythmic) before stimulation became significantly rhythmic (RI >= 0.01) after stimulation. Mean and median bursting frequency of these units were 8.32 +/- 0.72 (SE) Hz and 6.25 Hz (range, 2.5-17.5 Hz). In seven instances, two units were recorded simultaneously, and cross-correlation analysis showed that firing of six pairs was rhythmic and synchronized after stimulation. Optimal stimulation parameters for eliciting rhythmic bursting consisted in 500-ms trains of pulses delivered at 40-60 Hz. Together, our results show that repetitive stimulation of sensory afferents in vitro can elicit masticatory-like rhythmic bursting in NVsnpr neurons at physiological [Ca(2+)](e).

First published December 16, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00912.2009. We tested the hypothesis that area 5 of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) contributes to the planning of visually guided gait modifications. We recorded 121 neurons from the PPC of two cats during a task in which cats needed to process visual input to step over obstacles attached to a moving treadmill belt. During unobstructed locomotion, 64/121 (53%) of cells showed rhythmic activity. During steps over the obstacles, 102/121 (84%) of cells showed a significant change of their activity. Of these, 46/102 were unmodulated during the control task. We divided the 102 task-related cells into two groups on the basis of their discharge when the limb contralateral to the recording site was the first to pass over the obstacle. One group (41/102) was characterized by a brief, phasic discharge as the lead forelimb passed over the obstacle (Step-related cells). These cells were recorded primarily from area 5a. The other group (61/102) showed a progressive increase in activity prior to the onset of the swing phase in the modified limb and frequently diverged from control at least one step cycle before the gait modification (Step-advanced cells). Most of these cells were recorded in area 5b. In both groups, some cells maintained a fixed relationship to the activity of the contralateral forelimb regardless of which limb was the first to pass over the obstacle (limb-specific cells), whereas others changed their phase of activity so that they were always related to activity of the first limb to pass over the obstacle, either contralateral or ipsilateral (limb-independent cells). Limb-independent cells were more common among the Step-advanced cell population. We suggest that both populations of cells contribute to the gait modification and that the discharge characteristics of the Step-advanced cells are compatible with a contribution to the planning of the gait modification.

Yet in recent years it has also become possible to examine personality and related interpersonal processes as they unfold over time in association with event specific cues. The present article reviews research that (1) identifies behaviors that reflect the occurrence of hostile-irritable-quarrelsome traits in daily life, (2) demonstrates both the stability and within-person variability of these behaviors over time, (3) documents event-level interpersonal cues that are systematically associated with within-person variation in quarrelsome behavior, and (4) describes how dispositional level agreeableness and irritability moderate the associations of event-level cues with quarrelsome behavior. The influence of the neurotransmitter serotonin on quarrelsome behavior is also considered. The studies indicate that quarrelsome individuals have reduced affective reactivity to engaging in quarrelsome behavior, increased behavioral reactivity to perceptions of quarrelsomeness in others, and greater responsiveness to change in serotonin levels.

Large prospective birth cohort studies on environmental contaminants and child health - Goals, challenges, limitations and needs	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							BLOOD LEAD LEVELS; NORWEGIAN MOTHER; DISEASE; EXPOSURE; NEUROTOXICITY; CONSEQUENCES; LACTATION; PREGNANCY; OUTCOMES; PROFILE	The adverse health effects of environmental contaminants (ECs) are a rising public health concern, and a major threat to sustainable socioeconomic development. The developing fetuses and growing children are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of ECs. However, assessing the health impact of ECs presents a major challenge, given that multiple outcomes may arise from one exposure, multiple exposures may result in one outcome, and the complex interactions between ECs, and between ECs, nutrients and genetic factors, and the dynamic temporal changes in EC exposures during the life course. Large-scale prospective birth cohort studies collecting extensive data and specimen starting from the prenatal or pre-conception period, although costly, hold promise as a means to more clearly quantify the health effects of ECs, and to unravel the complex interactions between ECs, nutrients and genotypes. A number of such large-scale studies have been launched in some developed counties. We present an overview of "why", "what" and "how" behind these efforts with an objective to uncover major unidentified limitations and needs. Three major limitations were identified: (1) limited data and bio-specimens regarding early life EC exposure assessments in some birth cohort studies; (2) heavy participant burdens in some birth cohort studies may bias participant recruitment, and risk substantial loss to follow-up, protocol deviations limiting the quality of data and specimens collection, with an overall potential bias towards the null effect; (3) lack of concerted efforts in building comparable birth cohorts across countries to take advantage of natural "experiments" (large EC exposure level differences between countries) for more in-depth assessments of dose-response relationships, threshold exposure levels, and positive and negative effect modifiers.

J	Li, XF; Marrelec, G; Hess, RF; Benali, H				Li, Xingfeng; Marrelec, Guillaume; Hess, Robert F.; Benali, Habib			A nonlinear identification method to study effective connectivity in functional MRI	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						fMRI; Effective connectivity; Nonlinear system identification; Granger causality test; Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model	OUTPUT PARAMETRIC MODELS; NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS; FMRI DATA; STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS; GRANGER CAUSALITY; HUMAN AMBLYOPIA; EQUATION; BRAIN; AUTOREGRESSION; ALGORITHM	In this paper we propose a novel approach for characterizing effective connectivity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Unlike most other methods, our approach is nonlinear and does not rely on a priori specification of a model that contains structural information of neuronal populations. Instead, it relies on a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model and nonlinear system identification theory; the model's nonlinear connectivities are determined using a least squares method. A statistical test was developed to quantify the significance of the influence that regions exert on one another. We compared this approach with a linear method and applied it to the human visual cortex network. Results show that this method can be used to model nonlinear interaction between different regions for fMRI data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have shown that cycling can directly influence neuromuscular control during subsequent running in some highly trained triathletes. A relationship between this altered neuromuscular control of running and musculoskeletal pain and injury has been proposed; however, this link has not been investigated. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the influence of cycling on neuromuscular control during subsequent running in highly trained triathletes with and without exercise-related leg pain (ERLP). Methods: Participants were 34 highly trained triathletes: 10 triathletes with a history of ERLP and 24 training-matched control triathletes with no history of ERLP. Knee and ankle kinematics and leg muscle recruitment were compared between a baseline run (no prior exercise) and a transition run (preceded by cycling; i.e., run vs cycle run). Results: Knee and ankle joint kinematics were not different between baseline and transition runs for any triathletes: absolute mean difference (+/- 95% confidence interval) was 1.49 degrees +/- 0.17 degrees. However, muscle recruitment was different between baseline and transition runs, defined by absolute mean difference in EMG amplitude >= 10%, in 5 of 24 control triathletes (11/130 muscles exhibited altered recruitment) and in 5 of 10 triathletes with a history of ERLP (12/50 muscles exhibited altered recruitment). This represents a relative risk of 2.40 (0.89-6.50; P = 0.089) when defined by athletes and 2.62 (1.34-6.01; P < 0.01) when defined by muscles. The magnitude of change in muscle recruitment between baseline and transition runs was not different between control (14.10% +/- 2.34%) and ERLP triathletes (16.31% +/- 3.64%; P = 0.41). Conclusions: This study demonstrates an association between ERLP in triathletes and their neuromuscular control when running off the bike.

Pen-insular hemispherotomy in children: a single institution experience	MINERVA PEDIATRICA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Hemispherotomy; Pediatrics		The objective of this paper is to evaluate our experience in performing pen-insular hemispherotomy in refractory epileptic children. First, we address the history of hemispheric surgeries for epilepsy and then we compare our results to the medical literature in term of seizure control and complications. Between 1993 and 2007, 14 children who suffered from refractory hemispheric epilepsy underwent a pen-insular hemispherotomy. All children's charts were reviewed in a retrospective manner. Age at onset of epilepsy, imaging studies, cause of refractory epilepsy, electroencephalography findings, type of epileptic seizure, number of antiepileptic drugs (AED), preoperative neuropsychological evaluation and surgical outcome with regard to the children's seizure activity were analyzed. Nine boys and 5 girls were enrolled in this study. The mean age at onset of epilepsy was 16 months (range birth-5 years). All the children presented complex partiel seizures. Seizure frequency varied from 5 to 100 a day. The average delay prior to the hemispherotomy was 83 months (range 12-226 months). Mean age at the time of the surgery was 8.4 years (range 1.7-18 years). We performed 9 pen-insular hemispherotomies on the right side and 5 on the left. There were no reported surgical complications in this series. 10 children are seizure free (72%). Peri-insular hemispherotomy must be considered as a safe and very efficient therapeutic approach for children suffering from hemispheric refractory epilepsy. Pen-insular hemispherotomies are procedures where pathology and surgical technique interact narrowly. Acquired pathologies had better results than developmental ones.

This has traditionally been a major impediment in understanding the pathogenesis of this tumor and in developing ways for more effective management. Our aim is to chart DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) and get insight into genetic pathways involved in pGBM. Using the Illumina Infinium Human-1 bead-chip-array (100K single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]), we genotyped 18 pediatric and 6 adult GBMs. Results were compared to BAC-array profiles harvested on 16 of the same pGBM, to an independent data set of 9 pediatric high-grade astrocytomas (HGAs) analyzed on Affymetrix 250K-SNP arrays, and to existing data sets on HGAs. CNAs were additionally validated by real-time qPCR in a set of genes in pGBM. Our results identify with nonrandom clustering of CNAs in several novel, previously not reported, genomic regions, suggesting that alterations in tumor suppressors and genes involved in the regulation of RNA processing and the cell cycle are major events in the pathogenesis of pGBM. Most regions were distinct from CNAs in aGBMs and show an unexpectedly low frequency of genetic amplification and homozygous deletions and a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity for a high-grade I rapidly dividing tumor. This first, complete, high-resolution profiling of the tumor cell genome fills an important gap in studies on pGBM. It ultimately guides the mapping of oncogenic networks unique to pGBM, identification of the related therapeutic predictors and targets, and development of more effective therapies. It further shows that, despite commonalities in a few CNAs, pGBM and aGBMs are two different diseases.

To investigate mechanisms underlying decoding signals we employed high-resolution gradient-echo BOLD functional MRI Of Visual area VI We show that in addition to the fine-scale ocular dominance columns, coarse-scale Structures extending over several millimeters also convey discriminative power for decoding the stimulated eye Discriminative power is conveyed by both macroscopic blood vessels and gray matter regions. We hypothesize that gray-matter regions which drain into specific vessels may preferentially contain ocular-dominance columns biased towards one eye, the bias of a specific region thereby causing a functionally selective ocular-dominance response in the associated vessel Our findings indicate that coarse-scale Structures and macroscopic blood vessels contribute to decoding of the stimulated eye based oil low-resolution multivariate data.

The image is modeled is a collage of generic, localized image features that need not be present in all subjects Scale-space theory is applied to analyze image features at the characteristic scale of underlying anatomical structures, instead of at arbitrary scales such as global or voxel-level A probabilistic model describes features in terms of their appearance, geometry, and relationship to subject groups, and is automatically learned from a set of subject images and group labels. Features resulting from learning correspond to group-related anatomical structures that can potentially be used as image biomarkers of disease or as a basis for computer-aided diagnosis. The relationship between features and groups is quantified by the likelihood of feature occurrence within a specific group vs. the rest of the population, and feature significance IS quantified in terms of the false discovery rate. Experiments validate FBM clinically in the analysis of normal (NC) and Alzheimer's (AD) brain images using the freely available OASIS database FBM automatically identifies known structural differences between NC and AD subjects in a fully data-driven fashion, and an equal error classification rate of 0.80 is achieved for subjects aged 60-80 years exhibiting mild AD (CDR=1).

Ten French-speaking participants learned 80 Spanish words-40 cognates, 40 non-cognates-by means of a computer program The learning process included the early learning phase, which comprised 5 days, and the consolidation phase, which lasted 2 weeks. After each phase, participants performed an overt naming task during an er-fMRI scan Naming accuracy was better for cognates during the early learning phase only. However, cognates were named faster than non-cognates during both phases. The early learning phase was characterized by activations in the left iFG and Broca's area, which were associated With effortful lexical retrieval and phonological processing, respectively Further, the activation in the left ACC and DLPFC suggested that monitoring may be involved during the early phases of lexical learning During the consolidation phase, the activation in the left premotor cortex, the right supramarginal gyrus and the cerebellum indicated that articulatory planning may contribute to the consolidation of second-language phonetic representations. No dissociation between word type and learning phase could be supported. However. a Fisher r-to-z test showed that successful cognate retrieval was associated with activations in Broca's area, which could reflect the adaptation of known L1 phonological sequences. Moreover, successful retrieval of non-cognates was associated with activity in the anterior-medial left fusiform and right posterior cingulate cortices. suggesting that their successful retrieval may rely upon the access to semantic and lexical information, and even on the greater likelihood of errors (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved	[Raboyeau, G.; Marcotte, K.; Adrover-Roig, D.; Ansaldo, A.

Does Provision of Extrinsic Feedback Result in Improved Motor Learning in the Upper Limb Poststroke? A Systematic Review of the Evidence	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Review						stroke; rehabilitation; upper limb; feedback; review	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; UNILATERAL BRAIN-DAMAGE; SHORT-TERM; EXPLICIT INFORMATION; STROKE; IMPLICIT; SEQUENCE; THERAPY; QUALITY; REHABILITATION	Background. Recovery of the upper limb (UL) after a stroke occurs well into the chronic stage. Stroke survivors can benefit from adaptive plasticity to improve UL movement through motor relearning. The provision of feedback has been shown to decrease the use of compensatory UL movement patterns. However, the effectiveness of feedback in improving UL motor recovery after a stroke has not yet been systematically reviewed. Objective. The objective of this review was to systematically examine the role of extrinsic feedback on implicit motor learning after stroke, focusing on UL movement and functional recovery. Results. The authors retrieved 9 studies that examined the role of feedback on UL motor recovery. Of these, 6 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 was a single-subject design, 1 was a pre-post design, and 1 was a cohort study. The studies were rated on the basis of Sackett's levels of evidence and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scores for RCTs. Levels of evidence were limited (level 2b) for UL motor learning of the less-affected extremity and strong (level 1a) for the more-affected extremity. Discussion and conclusions. The results suggest that people with stroke may be capable of using extrinsic feedback for implicit motor learning and improving UL motor recovery. Emergent questions regarding the advantages of using different media for feedback delivery and the optimal type and schedule of feedback to enhance motor learning in patient populations still need to be addressed.

Gait and cognitive functions can deteriorate during dual tasking, especially in people with neurological deficits. Most Studies examining the simultaneous effects of dual tasking on motor and cognitive aspects were not performed in ecological environments. Using virtual reality technology, functional environments can be Simulated to study dual tasking. Objectives. The aims of this study were to test the feasibility of using a virtual functional environment for the examination of dual tasking and to determine the effects of dual tasking on gait parameters in people with stroke and age-matched controls who were healthy. Design. This was a cross-sectional observational study. Methods. Twelve community-dwelling older adults with stroke and 10 age-matched older adults who were healthy participated in the study. Participants walked on a self-paced treadmill while viewing a virtual grocery aisle projected onto a screen placed in front of them. They were asked to walk through the aisle (single task) or to walk and select ("shop for") items according to instructions delivered before or during walking (dual tasking). Results. Overall, the stroke group walked slower than the control group in both conditions, whereas both groups walked faster overground than on the treadmill. The stroke group also showed larger variability in gait speed and shorter stride length than the control group. There was a general tendency to increase gait speed and stride length during dual-task conditions; however, a significant effect of dual tasking was found only in one dual-task condition for gait speed and stride duration variability. All participants were able to complete the task with minimal mistakes. Limitations. The small size and heterogeneity of the sample were limitations of the study. Conclusions. It is feasible to use a functional virtual environment for investigation of dual tasking. Different gait strategies, including an increase or decrease in gait speed, can be used to cope with the increase in cognitive demands required for dual tasking.

Cystamine prevents MPTP-induced toxicity in young adult mice via the up-regulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						mRNA; Neuroprotection; Neurotrophin; Parkinson's disease; Tyrosine hydroxylase	PERSISTENT BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; NEURONAL DEGENERATION; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; RAT; MODEL; BDNF; CYSTEAMINE	Preclinical data suggest that cystamine stands as a promising neuroprotective agent against Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases. To decipher the mechanisms of action of cystamine, we investigated the effects of various doses of cystamine (10, 50, and 200 mg/kg) on the regulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its receptor tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB) and on the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) brain mRNA expression in relation to the time after administration. We have determined that the lower cystamine dose is the most efficient to promote putative neuroprotective effects. Indeed, an acute administration of 10 mg/kg of cystamine increased the expression of BDNF mRNA in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc), although it did not significantly influence TrkB or Hsp70 mRNA. Higher cystamine doses resulted in the absence of activation of any of these markers or led to non-specific effects. We have also substantiated the neuroprotective effect of a 21-day treatment of 10 mg/kg/day of cystamine in young adult mice against MPTP-induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-striatal fiber density, nigral dopamine cells and nigral Nurr1 mRNA expression. The neuroprotective action of cystamine in the same animals was associated with an up-regulation of BDNF in the SNc. Taken together, these results strengthen the neuroprotective potential of cystamine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and point towards the up-regulation of BDNF as an important mechanism of action.

A weight computing model of mutual affecting factors is derived from backward algorithm of ANN (BA-ANN), which diminishes the influence of factitious factor, the environment factor and the time factor to the weight. The BA-ANN model is used for modeling the correlation between danger class and 12 affecting factors of coal and gas outburst and calculating weights of interconnection factors, which performs very well. In order to classify danger classes in a daily routine, the EEM with the well trained weights which are from BA-ANN, is performed in a deep mine. The case study shows that this new technique is useful to classify danger classes with quick and accurate computation. Moreover, the weight computing model of BA-ANN can be extended to other safety issue in different fields as well. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for developmental exposure to BDE-47 in rats	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						PBPK; Pharmacokinetics; Polybrominated diphenyl ethers; Rat; Developmental exposure; BDE-47	POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS; SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; TEMPORAL TRENDS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; MICE; TOXICOKINETICS; DIOXINS	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are used commercially as additive flame retardants and have been shown to transfer into environmental compartments, where they have the potential to bioaccumulate in wildlife and humans. Of the 209 possible PBDEs, 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) is usually the dominant congener found in human blood and milk samples. BDE-47 has been shown to have endocrine activity and produce developmental, reproductive, and neurotoxic effects. The objective of this study was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for BDE-47 in male and female (pregnant and non-pregnant) adult rats to facilitate investigations of developmental exposure. This model consists of eight compartments: liver, brain, adipose tissue, kidney, placenta, fetus, blood, and the rest of the body. Concentrations of BDE-47 from the literature and from maternal-fetal pharmacokinetic studies conducted at RTI International were used to parameterize and evaluate the model. The results showed that the model simulated BDE-47 tissue concentrations in adult male, maternal, and fetal compartments within the standard deviations of the experimental data. The model's ability to estimate BDE-47 concentrations in the fetus after maternal exposure will be useful to design in utero exposure/effect studies. This PBPK model is the first one designed for any PBDE pharmaco/toxicokinetic description. The next steps will be to expand this model to simulate BDE-47 pharmacokinetics and distributions across species (mice), and then extrapolate it to humans. After mouse and human model development, additional PBDE congeners will be incorporated into the model and simulated as a mixture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although changes in the sensitivity of this relation are associated with pathophysiological conditions, central mechanisms modulating osmoregulatory gain are unknown. Here, we review recent data that sheds important light on this process. The cell autonomous osmosensitivity of vasopressin neurons depends on cation channels comprising a variant of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel. Hyperosmotic activation is mediated by a mechanical process where sensitivity increases in proportion with actin filament density. Moreover, angiotensin II amplifies osmotic activation by a rapid stimulation of actin polymerization, suggesting that neurotransmitter-induced changes in cytoskeletal organization in osmosensory neurons can mediate central changes in osmoregulatory gain.

Disease states and aging, which influence the adaptation of biological systems, modify the complexity of system response to environment changes. The alteration of motor adaptivity seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) has never been properly investigated by using the motor response complexity measured with sample entropy. We show here that the differences in the complexity of the involuntary movements can be efficiently used for the discrimination of the PD treatment state (non-dyskinetic/dyskinetic). We studied the complexity in the involuntary movements of three groups of subjects, normal, non-dyskinetic PD, and dyskinetic PD, by using the sample entropy for multiple time-scales. During experiments the subjects were standing with their arms extended in front of them while performing a cognitive task. PD subjects were tested after levodopa administration in their "best" ON condition. For all subject groups we found that the sample entropy increased almost linearly with the increase of the time-scale. The biggest increase was found in the dyskinetic PD and the least in non-dyskinetic PD subjects. This shows that system adaptivity, as revealed by the complexity analysis of postural displacement, is lower than normal in non-dyskinetic PD patients, but is abnormally increased in dyskinetic patients. The clear difference between the sample entropy-based measures for the non-dyskinetic and dyskinetic patients made possible the automatic, efficient recognition of the dyskinetic condition, based on multi-layer perceptrons.

Twelve MDD participants and 12 never-depressed controls completed the negative affective priming (NAP) task in the scanner. Results indicated that, in depressed participants, increased activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) is associated with inhibition of negative, but not positive, words; in contrast, in nondepressed participants, inhibition of positive, but not negative, words is associated with increased activation in the rACC. These findings indicate that abnormalities in neural function, especially in the rACC, may underlie difficulties experienced by depressed individuals in inhibiting negative thoughts. These results underscore the importance of continuing to examine the relation between cognitive and neural functioning in depression in order to gain a broader and more integrative understanding of this disorder.

Different mechanisms are presumably responsible for the processing of shorter (below 500 ms) and longer (above 500 ms) events but have not yet been a subject of an investigation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the present study, we show a greater involvement of several brain regions - including right-hemispheric midline structures and left-hemispheric lateral regions - in the processing of visual stimuli of shorter as compared to longer duration. We propose a greater involvement of lower-level cognitive mechanisms in the processing of shorter events as opposed to higher-level mechanisms of cognitive control involved in longer events.

CAPROSPINOL REDUCES AMYLOID DEPOSITS AND IMPROVES COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN A RAT MODEL OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurosteroids; neurodegeneration; neuroinflammation; beta-amyloid; Alzheimer's disease	NEURONAL CELLS; BETA; IMPAIRMENT; PEPTIDE	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prominent form of dementia in elderly, is a yet incurable degenerative neurological illness characterized by memory loss. Here, we used an AD rat model to investigate the in vivo efficacy of caprospinol, a disease-modifying steroid developed on the concept that reduced synthesis of 22R-hydroxycholesterol in the AD brain increases beta-amyloid neurotoxicity. Caprospinol treatment of diseased rats attenuated memory impairment, as assessed using Morris watermaze tests. This recovery of cognitive function was accompanied by a reduction in hippocampal amyloid deposits, astrogliosis, neurodegeneration and Tau protein phopshorylation. In parallel studies, caprospinol bioavailability in normal rat forebrain was found to be dependent on the dose and duration of the treatment, demonstrating the ability of the compound to cross the blood-brain barrier. These results position caprospinol as a promising drug candidate for AD treatment. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Severity of REM atonia loss in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder predicts Parkinson disease	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEMENTIA; DISTURBANCES; DIAGNOSIS; PATHOLOGY; TIME	Background: Over 50% of persons with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) will develop Parkinson disease (PD) or dementia. At present, there is no way to predict who will develop disease. Since polysomnography is performed in all patients with idiopathic RBD at diagnosis, there is an opportunity to analyze if baseline sleep variables predict eventual neurodegenerative disease. Methods: In a longitudinally studied cohort of patients with idiopathic RBD, we identified those who had developed neurodegenerative disease. These patients were matched by age, sex, and follow-up duration to patients with RBD who remained disease-free and to controls. Polysomnographic variables at baseline (i.e., before development of neurodegenerative disease) were compared between groups. Results: Twenty-six patients who developed neurodegenerative disease were included (PD 12, multiple system atrophy 1, dementia 13). The interval between polysomnogram and disease onset was 6.7 years, mean age was 69.5, and 81% were male. There were no differences between groups in sleep latency, sleep time, % stages 2-4, % REM sleep, or sleep efficiency. However, patients with idiopathic RBD who developed neurodegenerative disease had increased tonic chin EMG activity during REM sleep at baseline compared to those who remained disease-free (62.7 +/- 6.0% vs 41.0 +/- 6.0%, p = 0.020). This effect was seen only in patients who developed PD (72.9 +/- 6.0% vs 41.0 +/- 6.0%, p = 0.002), and not in those who developed dementia (54.3 +/- 10.3, p = 0.28). There was no difference in phasic submental REM EMG activity between groups. Conclusions: In patients with REM sleep behavior disorder initially free of neurodegenerative disease, the severity of REM atonia loss on baseline polysomnogram predicts the development of Parkinson disease.

The crystal structures of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were also determined by X-ray diffraction. The complexes show interesting structural motifs. Complex 6 is a monomer, With octahedral (Oh) geometry around the metal ion formed by three sulfur and three iodide atoms. Complexes 3 and 5 are dimers, with a square pyramidal (SP) geometry in each monomeric unit, while complexes 4 and 7 are polymers with pseudotrigonal bipyramidal (psi-TBP). Two or three sulfur atoms from thioamide ligands and three iodide atoms are bound to Sb atoms forming building blocks for the dimers and polymers. Strong intramolecular interactions between mu(2)(-)l and/or mu(2)-S and Sb atoms stabilize both structures. In dimer complex 5, two terminal iodide and one terminal sulfur atom are bonded to the Sb ion, while two mu(2)-1 and one mu(2)-S bridging atoms bridge the metal ions forming psi-Oh geometry. Computational studies using multivariant linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) and considering biological results (50% inhibitory concentration, IC50) as dependent variables derived a theoretical equation for IC50 values of the complexes studied. The calculated IC50 values are compared satisfactorily with the experimental inhibitory activity of the complexes measured. Complexes 3-7 were used to study their influence upon the catalytic peroxidation of linoleic acid by the enzyme Lipoxygenase (LOX). Compounds 1-8 were also tested for in vitro cytotoxicity, and they showed mostly a moderate cytostatc activity against a variety of tumor cell lines but comparable With those found for the antimony(III) chloride and bromide complexes, reported earlier [Ozturk et al.

D-Fenfluramine is a 5-HT releasing drug, frequently used in the study of the responsivity of the 5-HT system in subjects with psychiatric disorders, including depression. The aim of the study is to assess the influence of the serotonin-releaser, D-fenfluramine, in the OBX rat model of depression, as measured by the change in the regional cerebral glucose utilization rCGU) following D-fenfluramine injection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (160-180 g) were used. The rats were divided into OBX and Sham groups. Two weeks following the olfactory bulbectomy or the sham surgery, six rats (randomly assigned) from each group received an i.p. injection of D-fenfluramine with a dose of 5 mg/kg or the same volume of saline. Twenty minutes later, the rCGU rates were measured using 2-[C-14]deoxyglucose autoradiography. The general linear model statistical analysis has shown that the rCGU in the sham-operated rats treated with D-fenfluramine, compared to the sham-operated rats treated with saline, was lower in 14 (36%) out of 39 examined brain regions. There was no significant difference in the rCGU between the OBX rats treated with D-fenfluramine and OBX rats treated with saline. The results suggest the blunted capacity of the 5-HT system in OBX rats to respond to the challenge by the 5-HT releasing compound, D-fenfluramine. This resembles similar findings in clinical studies on depressed patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Conventional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have revealed the macrostructural abnormalities of CC and its subdivisions in ADHD compared with controls. However, no study has examined the macrostructural and micro structural characteristics of the CC in the same ADHD group. In this study, MRI morphometric and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques were combined to explore the area and measure fractional anisotropy (FA) abnormality of CC and its seven subdivisions in children with ADHD. Twenty-eight boys with ADHD (13.3 +/- 1.5 years) and 27 age- and gender- matched controls (13.2 +/- 0.9 years) were included. We co-registered individual structural MRI and DTI images manually and subdivided the midsagittal CC into seven subdivisions. The area and FA of the CC and its subdivisions were then compared between the patients and the matched controls. Results showed that ADHD had decreased area of entire CC, anterior middle-body, and isthmus. Meanwhile, reduced FA value of the isthmus was found in the ADHD group compared with the controls. our study indicated that not only macrostructural abnormalities but also microstructural alterations in CC, especially in isthmus occurred in ADHD. The abnormality of the isthmus, the subdivision that contains the fibers connecting posterior regions of brain, may play an important role in the pathophysiology of ADHD and maybe implicated in the disorders of attention.

Myxoma Virus Virotherapy for Glioma in Immunocompetent Animal Models: Optimizing Administration Routes and Synergy with Rapamycin	CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							VESICULAR STOMATITIS-VIRUS; RECURRENT GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME; CONVECTION-ENHANCED DELIVERY; ONCOLYTIC VIRUS; MALIGNANT GLIOMAS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; I INTERFERON; CANCER VIROTHERAPY; TUMOR-MODELS; CELLS	Oncolytic myxoma virus (MYXV) is being developed as a novel virotherapeutic against human brain cancer and has promising activity against human brain tumor models in immunocompromised hosts. Because an intact immune system could reduce its efficacy, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the oncolytic potential of MYXV in immunocompetent racine glioma models. Here, we report that MYXV infects and kills all racine cell glioma lines and that its effects are enhanced by rapamycin. Intratumoral administration of MYXV with rapamycin improved viral replication in the tumor and significantly prolonged host survival. Similarly, coadministration via a method of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) enhanced viral replication and efficacy in vivo. Mechanisms by which rapamycin improved MYXV oncolysis included an inhibition of type I IFN production in vitro and a reduction of intratumoral infiltration of CD68(+) microglia/macrophages and CD163(+) macrophages in vivo. Our findings define a method to improve MYXV efficacy against gliomas by rapamycin coadministration, which acts to promote immune responses engaged by viral delivery. Cancer Res; 70(2); 598-608.

The basis for these lesions is unclear, but may involve a disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission. We have therefore investigated levels of the astrocytic glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2 in order to evaluate their role in the pathophysiology of this disorder. Histological assessment of the frontal cortex revealed a significant loss of neurons in neuropathologically confirmed cases of WE compared with age-matched controls, concomitant with decreases in a-internexin and synaptophysin protein content of 67 and 52% by immunoblotting. EAAT2 levels were diminished by 71% in WE, with levels of EAAT1 also reduced by 62%. Loss of both transporter sites was confirmed by immunohistochemical methods. Development of TD in rats caused a profound loss of EAAT1 and EAAT2 in the thalamus accompanied by decreases in other astrocyte-specific proteins. Treatment of TD rats with N-acetyleysteine prevented the downregulation of EAAT2 in the medial thalamus, and ameliorated the loss of several other astrocyte proteins, concomitant with increased neuronal survival. Our results suggest that (1) loss of EAAT1 and EAAT2 glutamate transporters is associated with structural damage to the frontal cortex in patients with WE, (2) oxidative stress plays an important role in this process, and (3) TD has a profound effect on the functional integrity of astrocytes. Based on these findings, we recommend that early treatment using a combination of thiamine AND antioxidant approaches should be an important consideration in cases of WE. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Summation maps of [F-18]-MPPF uptake during the first 100 seconds after intravenous injection were calculated in groups of rats with vehicle (glucose 5%) pretreatment, or following pretreatment with TQD at doses of 5, 15, or 30 mg/kg. The early summation image (K-1-weighted), were validated as a surrogate marker for the physiological blood-brain clearance (K-1; ml g(-1) min(-1)) by linear graphic analysis of the unidirectional blood-brain clearance relative to an image-based arterial input measured in the left ventricle of the heart. In the same animals, parametric maps of the [F-18]-MPPF binding potential (BPND) were calculated from the entire 60-minute emission recordings using conventional reference tissue methods. All [F-18]-MPPF recordings were followed by an [F-18]-FDG emission recording, the summation of which was used for spatial normalization to a rat brain atlas. Test-retest variability of K-1-weighted uptake and BPND was 25%. TQD treatment evoked a global dose-dependent increase in K-1-weighted summation, which increased 2.5-fold with TQD (30 mg/kg), suggesting an IC50 of 5 mg/kg TQD. All TQD doses increased the apparent [F-18]-MPPF BPND calculated by the Logan method by 30%-40%, a bias likely arising due to increased free [F-18]-MPPF concentrations in brain. TQD (15 mg/kg) evoked a 45% global increase in [F-18]-FDG uptake, suggesting perturbation of brain energy metabolism due to P-gp blockade. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Bimodal modulation and continuous stimulation in optical imaging to map direction selectivity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Area 17; Area 18; Cat; Fourier; Intrinsic signals; Orientation selectivity; Spatial frequency; Motion; Visual cortex; Cortical map	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL AREA 21A; INTRINSIC SIGNALS; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; ORIENTATION PREFERENCE; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; MOUSE; ORGANIZATION; FEEDBACK; RESOLUTION	In the visual system, neurons with similar functional properties such as orientation and direction selectivity are clustered together to form modules. Optical imaging recordings in combination with episodic paradigms have been previously used to estimate direction selectivity, a fundamental property of visual neurons. The major drawback of the episodic approach is that the extraction of the signal from various forms of physiological noise is difficult, leading to a poor estimation of direction. Recent work, based on periodic stimulation and Fourier decomposition improved the extraction of periodic stimulus responses from noise and thus, reduced the recording time considerably. Given the success of this new paradigm in mapping orientation, the present study evaluated its reliability to measure direction selectivity in the visual cortex of anesthetized cats. Here, a model that exploits the harmonics of the Fourier decomposition is proposed where the first harmonic is related to direction responses, and the second to orientation. As expected, the first harmonic was absent when a static stimulus was presented. Contrarily, the first harmonic was present when moving stimuli were presented and the amplitude was greater with random dots kinematograms than with drifting gratings. The phase of the first harmonic showed a good agreement with direction preference measured by episodic paradigm. The ratio of the first/the second harmonic amplitude, related to a direction index, was weaker in fracture. It was also weaker in areas of the ventral pathway (areas 17 and 21 a) where direction selectivity is known to be reduced. These results indicate that a periodic paradigm can be easily used to measure specific parameters in optical signals, particularly in situations when short acquisition periods are needed.

Gradient distortions in MRI: Characterizing and correcting for their effects on SIENA-generated measures of brain volume change	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							REMITTING MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; ATROPHY MEASUREMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; REGISTRATION; VALIDATION; ACCURATE; PHANTOM; IMAGES	Precise and accurate quantification of whole-brain atrophy based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is an important goal in understanding the natural progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. We found that inconsistent MRI positioning of subjects is common in typically acquired clinical trial data - particularly along the magnet's long (i.e., Z) axis. We also found that, if not corrected for, the gradient distortion effects associated With Such Z-shifts can significantly decrease the accuracy and precision of MRI-derived measures of whole-brain atrophy negative effects that increase in magnitude with (i) increases in the Z-distance between the brains to be compared and (ii) increases in the Z-distance from magnet isocenter of the center of the pair of brains to be compared. These gradient distortion effects can be reduced by accurate subject positioning, and they can also be corrected post hoc with the use of appropriately-generated gradient-distortion correction fields. We used a novel DUPLO-based phantom to develop a spherical-harmonics-based gradient distortion field that was used to (i) correct for observed Z-shift-associated gradient distortion effects on SIENA-generated measures of brain atrophy and (ii) simulate the gradient distortion effects that might be expected with a greater range of Z-shifts than those that we were able to acquire. Our results suggest that consistent alignment to magnet isocenter and/or correcting for the observed effects of gradient distortion should lead to more accurate and precise estimates of brain-related changes and, as a result, to increased statistical power in studies aimed at understanding the natural progression and the effective treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

J	Zerouali, Y; Jemel, B; Godbout, R				Zerouali, Younes; Jemel, Boutheina; Godbout, Roger			The effects of early and late night partial sleep deprivation on automatic and selective attention: An ERP study	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Mismatch negativity; Negative difference; Selective sleep deprivation	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; DECISION-MAKING; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; RECOVERY SLEEP; WORKING-MEMORY; REM-SLEEP; PERFORMANCE	The link between decrease in levels of attention and total sleep deprivation is well known but the respective contributions of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) is still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of sleep deprivation during the SWS phase (i.e., early night sleep) and the REM phase (i.e., late night sleep) on tasks that tap automatic and selective attention; these two forms of attention were indexed respectively by "mismatch negativity" (MMN) and "negative difference" (Nd) event-related potential (ERP) difference waves. Ten young adult participants were subjected to a three-night sleep protocol. They were each received one night of full sleep (F), one night of sleep deprivation during the first half of the night (H1), and one night of sleep deprivation during the second half of the night (H2). MMN and Nd were recorded the following morning of each night during two auditory oddball tasks that tapped automatic and selective attention. The effect of sleep deprivation condition was assessed using ERP amplitude measures and standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography method (sLORETA). ERP results revealed significant MMN amplitude reduction over frontal and temporal recording areas following the H2 night compared to F and H1, indicating reductions in levels of automatic attention. in addition, Nd amplitude over the parietal recording area was significantly increased following the H2 night compared to F and H1. sLORETA findings show significant changes from F to H2 night in frontal cortex activity, decreasing during the automatic attention task but increasing during the selective attention task. No significant change in brain activity is observed after H1 night. The restoration of attention processes is mainly achieved during REM sleep, which confirms results from previous studies in rat models. The anterior cortex seems to be more sensitive to sleep loss, while the parietal cortex acts as a compensatory resource to restore cognitive performance in a task context. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

How this occurs remains unresolved. This study examined the possibility that the symmetry occurred at the level of the inputs from the MLR to reticulospinal (RS) cells. In lamprey semi-intact preparations, we recorded intracellular responses of pairs of large, homologous RS cells on both sides to stimulation of the MLR on one side. The synaptic responses on both sides were very similar in shape, amplitude, and threshold intensity. Increasing MLR stimulation intensity produced a symmetrical increase in the magnitude of the responses on both sides. Ca(2+) imaging confirmed the bilateral activation of smaller-sized RS cells as well. In a high-divalent cation solution, the synaptic responses of homologous RS cells persisted and exhibited a constant latency during high-frequency stimulation. Moreover, during gradual replacement of normal Ringer's solution with a Ca(2+)-free solution, the magnitude of responses showed a gradual reduction with a similar time course in the homologous RS cells. These results support the idea that the MLR projects monosynaptically to RS cells on both sides with symmetrical inputs. During locomotion of the semi-intact preparation, the discharge pattern was also very similar in homologous bilateral RS cells. Anatomical experiments confirmed the presence of MLR neurons projecting ipsilaterally to the reticular formation intermingled with neurons projecting contralaterally. We conclude that the bilaterally symmetrical MLR inputs to RS cells are likely contributors to generating symmetrical locomotor activity.

Neurodevelopmental effects of chronic exposure to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a developing visual system	NEURAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; GLIAL TNF-ALPHA; IN-VIVO; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; XENOPUS TADPOLES; OPTIC TECTUM; RETINOTECTAL PROJECTION	Background: Imbalances in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been increasingly correlated with a number of severe and prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia and Down syndrome. Although several studies have shown that cytokines have potent effects on neural function, their role in neural development is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the link between abnormal cytokine levels and neural development using the Xenopus laevis tadpole visual system, a model frequently used to examine the anatomical and functional development of neural circuits. Results: Using a test for a visually guided behavior that requires normal visual system development, we examined the long-term effects of prolonged developmental exposure to three pro-inflammatory cytokines with known neural functions: interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. We found that all cytokines affected the development of normal visually guided behavior. Neuroanatomical imaging of the visual projection showed that none of the cytokines caused any gross abnormalities in the anatomical organization of this projection, suggesting that they may be acting at the level of neuronal microcircuits. We further tested the effects of TNF-alpha on the electrophysiological properties of the retinotectal circuit and found that long-term developmental exposure to TNF-alpha resulted in enhanced spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission in tectal neurons, increased AMPA/NMDA ratios of retinotectal synapses, and a decrease in the number of immature synapses containing only NMDA receptors, consistent with premature maturation and stabilization of these synapses. Local interconnectivity within the tectum also appeared to remain widespread, as shown by increased recurrent polysynaptic activity, and was similar to what is seen in more immature, less refined tectal circuits. TNF-alpha treatment also enhanced the overall growth of tectal cell dendrites. Finally, we found that TNF-alpha-reared tadpoles had increased susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Conclusions: Taken together our data are consistent with a model in which TNF-alpha causes premature stabilization of developing synapses within the tectum, therefore preventing normal refinement and synapse elimination that occurs during development, leading to increased local connectivity and epilepsy. This experimental model also provides an integrative approach to understanding the effects of cytokines on the development of neural circuits and may provide novel insights into the etiology underlying some neurodevelopmental disorders.

Cell-autonomous generation of mitochondrial superoxide is a signal for cell death in differentiated neuronal precursor cells	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Optic neuropathy; Superoxide; Neurons; Superoxide dismutase; Gene silencing	RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; DISMUTASE; FLUORESCENCE; APOPTOSIS; KINASE; LINE	The vast majority of optic neuropathies result from retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axonal injury, This induces cell death and is associated with a burst of mitochondria-generated superoxide within the soma. It is unclear whether there is a clear causal relationship between superoxide generation and cell death. To determine whether mitochondrial-generated superoxide can cause cell-autonomous death signaling, we knocked down SOD2 in a pure population of RGC-5 cells, a neuronal precursor cell line that can be differentiated to resemble retinal ganglion cells. RGC-5 cells were differentiated and transfected with siRNA for SOD2 or a scramble control. Viability, superoxide production, cytotoxic RNA transfection efficiency, and measurement of SOD2 protein levels by immunoblotting were assayed at varying times after transfection. SOD2 knockdown increased intracellular superoxide levels and cell death was presumed triggered from knockdown. This was amplified when extramitochondrial superoxide was elevated with the redox cycling agent menadione. Dysregulation of mitochondrial superoxide in differentiated RGC-5 cells is likely a potent signal for cell death, consistent with a role of this reactive oxygen species in apoptosis signaling after axonal injury.

Data showed that in the absence of overt prosodic boundaries, verb-intrinsic transitivity biases influence parsing preferences (late closure) online, resulting in a larger P600 garden path effect for transitive than intransitive verbs. Surprisingly, this lexical effect was mediated by prosodic processing, a closure positive shift brain response was elicited in total absence of acoustic boundary markers for transitively biased sentences only. Our results suggest early interactive integration of hierarchically organized processes rather than purely independent effects of lexical and prosodic information. As a primacy of prosody would predict, overt speech boundaries overrode both structural preferences and transitivity biases.

Extracellular single neuron recordings were thus carried out in anaesthetized newborn rats between postnatal (P) day 15 and 30 and in adult rats. The first neuronal responses evoked by drifting sinusoidal gratings were obtained at P16. From P27-P30 to adulthood, the neurons' optimal temporal frequency significantly increased, whereas the contrast threshold decreased. However, the optimal spatial frequency, spatial resolution and spatial bandwidth were, soon after eye opening, similar to those observed in the adult rat. The differential maturation of receptive field properties is discussed with regard to the functional pathways of the rat visual system.

Brain Volume and Metabolism in Fetuses With Congenital Heart Disease Evaluation With Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy	CIRCULATION			English	Article						brain; congenital; fetal; magnetic resonance imaging; pediatrics	HYPOTHERMIC CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; FETAL-BRAIN; CIRCULATORY ARREST; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; MR SPECTROSCOPY; INFANTS; SURGERY; DEFECTS	Background-Adverse neurodevelopmental outcome is an important source of morbidity in children with congenital heart disease (CHD). A significant proportion of newborns with complex CHD have abnormalities of brain size, structure, or function, which suggests that antenatal factors may contribute to childhood neurodevelopmental morbidity. Methods and Results-Brain volume and metabolism were compared prospectively between 55 fetuses with CHD and 50 normal fetuses with the use of 3-dimensinal volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Fetal intracranial cavity volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, and total brain volume were measured by manual segmentation. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure the cerebral N-acetyl aspartate: choline ratio (NAA: choline) and identify cerebral lactate. Complete fetal echocardiograms were performed. Gestational age at magnetic resonance imaging ranged from 251/7 to 371/7 weeks (median, 30 weeks). During the third trimester, there were progressive and significant declines in gestational age-adjusted total brain volume and intracranial cavity volume in CHD fetuses relative to controls. NAA: choline increased progressively over the third trimester in normal fetuses, but the rate of rise was significantly slower (P<0.001) in CHD fetuses. On multivariable analysis adjusted for gestational age and weight percentile, cardiac diagnosis and percentage of combined ventricular output through the aortic valve were independently associated with total brain volume. Independent predictors of lower NAA: choline included diagnosis, absence of antegrade aortic arch flow, and evidence of cerebral lactate (P<0.001). Conclusions-Third-trimester fetuses with some forms of CHD have smaller gestational age-and weight-adjusted total brain volumes than normal fetuses and evidence of impaired neuroaxonal development and metabolism. Hemodynamic factors may play an important role in this abnormal development. (Circulation. 2010; 121: 26-33.)

The functional significance of neurotransmitter coexistence is, however, less well understood. Several studies have shown that a subpopulation of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) expresses the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) and has been suggested to use glutamate as a cotransmitter. The VTA dopamine neurons project to limbic structures including the nucleus accumbens, and are involved in mediating the motivational and locomotor activating effects of psychostimulants. To determine the functional role of glutamate cotransmission by these neurons, we deleted VGLUT2 in DA neurons by using a conditional gene-targeting approach in mice. A DAT-Cre/Vglut2Lox mouse line (Vglut2(f/f;DAT-Cre) mice) was produced and analyzed by in vivo amperometry as well as by several behavioral paradigms. Although basal motor function was normal in the Vglut2(f/f;DAT-Cre) mice, their risk-taking behavior was altered. Interestingly, in both home-cage and novel environments, the gene targeted mice showed a greatly blunted locomotor response to the psychostimulant amphetamine, which acts via the midbrain DA system. Our results show that VGLUT2 expression in DA neurons is required for normal emotional reactivity as well as for psychostimulant-mediated behavioral activation.

The precise information of rotor speed and position is required to perform maximum power tracking in variable speed wind turbine, which is very difficult to estimate under varying operating conditions, as it may lead to parameter variation such as stator resistance, inductance and torque constant. To neutralize the effect of parameter variation, an ANFIS based adaptive model is developed to track the rotor position and speed accurately in the whole range of low to high speed under varying wind conditions. A detailed comparison of two different estimation techniques based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy system and sliding mode observers is also provided under varying speed with variable PMSG parameters. Both of the estimation techniques are realized and simulated in MATLAB/SPS environment. The simulation results under dynamic operating conditions are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach.

The impact of the number of bits per sample and the sampling rate used by each data acquisition channel are analysed and quantified. The approach consists of minimizing the sampling frequency and the number of bits per sample of the extracellular neural recordings. The proposed approach allows increasing the number of channels that may be monitored simultaneously without additional computation, by a factor up to 5.

STRAIGHTENING THE SPINAL CORD USING FIBRE TRACTOGRAPHY	2010 7TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING: FROM NANO TO MACRO	IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging		English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro	APR 14-17, 2010	Rotterdam, NETHERLANDS	IEEE, Engn Med Biol Soc, Signal Processing Soc		Diffusion MRI; Spinal Cord; Tractography; Straightening; Gaussian Processes	TRACKING; BRAIN	Spinal Cord MRI (SC-MRI) is a challenging research field with numerous important clinical and basic research applications. Some of the SC-MRI applications strongly need to deal with a well straightened spinal cord either for appropriate methodological developments, for better visualization or diagnostic purposes. In this article, we develop an efficient and automatic method to straighten the spinal cord image and fibres. Diffusion Tensor MRI is first used to recover by tractography the bundles of fibres contained in the spinal cord white matter. An efficient Gaussian process framework is then used to automatically recover in a robust way the most representative fibre which is used to interpolate and straighten the spinal cord image and fibres.

Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, the stability of overall system is guaranteed and the boundedness of all signals is ensured, while appropriate switching of the multiple models ensures asymptotic tracking for the system states.

The current spatial extent of neural activation is several millimeters but with greater specificity, transcranial magnetic stimulation can potentially deliver real time feedback to reinforce or extinguish behavior by exciting or inhibiting localized neural circuits. The specificity of transcranial magnetic stimulation is a function of the stimulation coil geometry. In this paper, a practical multi-layer framework for the design of miniaturized stimulation coils is presented. This framework is based on a magnet wire fabricated from 2500 braided ultrafine wires. Effects of coil bending angle on stimulation specificity are examined using realistic finite element method simulations. A novel stimulation coil with one degree of freedom is also proposed that shows improved specificity over the conventional fixed coils. This type of coil could be potentially used as a feedback system for a bidirectional brain machine interface.

Given that the visual marking of HFOs is highly time-consuming and subjective, automatic detectors are necessary. In this study, we present a novel automatic detector that detects HFOs by incorporating information of previously detected baselines. The detector was trained on 72 channels and tested on 278, achieving a mean sensitivity of 96.8% with a mean false positive rate of 4.86%. This low rate is reasonable since only visually marked baseline segments were considered as the true negatives. This detector could be useful for the systematic study of HFOs and for their eventual clinical application.

GNL-HybELS: An Algorithm to Classify and Identify VOR Responses Simultaneously	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; VESTIBULAR FUNCTION; NYSTAGMUS; SYSTEMS; MODULATION; MOVEMENTS; PATHWAYS; MODEL	The Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) stabilizes the images of the world on the retinae when the head is in motion. Basic daily activities such as walking or driving depend on the proper functioning of this reflex. For several decades, scientists have developed methods to model and identify this system mathematically. However, traditional methods cannot analyze VOR data comprehensively because they disregard pieces of data (fast phases) which biases estimated reflex dynamics. Here we propose, for the first time, an automated tool to analyze entire VOR responses (slow and fast phases), without apriori classification of nystagmus segments. We have developed GNL-HybELS (Generalized NonLinear Hybrid Extended Least Squares), a tool to simultaneously classify and identify the responses of a multi-mode nonlinear system with delay, such as the horizontal VOR. This algorithm combines Generalized Principle Component Analysis (GPCA) for classification, and Hybrid Extended Least Squares (HybELS) for identification. The method was validated on noisy simulation data and tested on experimental data. GNL-HybELS classifies and identifies dynamic parameters, nonlinearity, and delay of a multi-mode (hybrid) system, with high accuracy and robustness, with rms prediction errors between 1.3-2.6 deg for measured data. It enables researchers and clinicians to analyze VOR responses reliably, and therefore, can pave the way for more precise diagnoses and treatments for lesions and diseases of the vestibular system. It can also be readily applied to other neural systems that exhibit switching or multi-mode behavior.

The use of an array of electrically pumped vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) diodes at specific wavelengths for high-power narrow single-frequency emission leads to a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the measured NIR absorption spectrum while maximizing the sensor's sensitivity to small absorption changes. A Quantum well infrared (QWI) photodetector senses the received optical power after passage through the blood sample, followed by an artificial neural network (ANN) for the measurement of glucose in a whole blood matrix. For an independent test set made with bovine blood, the optimal ANN topology for processing the two selected spectral bands yielded a standard error of prediction of 0.42 mM (i.e., 7.56 mg/dl) over the concentration range of 4-20 mM.

The CLNS combines epileptic seizure detection with simultaneous electrical stimulation feedback. The system amplifies the neural signal with adjustable gain, detects epileptic low-voltage fast-activity, and generates programmable stimulation currents. The implemented seizure detector is based on a detection algorithm validated in Matlab tools and was tested using intracerebral electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings from a patient with drug-resistant epilepsy. The amplifier, epileptic-seizure detector and electric stimulator were implemented using CMOS 0.18-mu m process. The iEEG were assessed by the proposed CMOS building blocks and the predefined seizure suppression biphasic electrical stimulations were administrated at 2 to 3 sec after electrographical seizure onsets. The simulated power consumption of the CLNS has showed that the system could run on a button cell battery for more than 8 years.

In this paper, an incremental learning strategy based on a dynamic particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm allows to produce heterogeneous ensembles of classifiers for video-based face recognition. This strategy is applied to an adaptive classification system (ACS) comprised of a swarm of fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) neural network classifiers, a DPSO algorithm, and a long term memory (LTM). The performance of this ACS with an ensemble of FAM networks selected among local bests of the swarm, is compared to that of the ACS with the global best network under different incremental learning scenarios. Performance is assessed in terms of classification rate and resource requirements for incremental learning of new data blocks extracted from real-world video streams, and are given along with reference kNN and FAM classifier optimized for batch learning. Simulation results indicate that the learning strategy maintains diversity within the ensemble classifiers, providing a significantly higher classification rate than that of the best FAM network alone. However, classification with an ensemble requires more resources.

It is based on the concept of neural network evolution in that particles of a MOPSO swarm (i.e., network solutions) seek to determine user-defined parameters and network (weights and architecture) such that generalisation error and network resources are minimized. The performance of this strategy has been assessed with fuzzy ARTMAP using synthetic and real-world data for video-based face classification. Simulation results indicate that when the MOPSO strategy is used to train fuzzy ARTMAP, it produces a significantly lower classification error than when trained using standard hyper-parameter settings. Furthermore, the non-dominated MOPSO solutions represent a better compromise between error and resource allocation than mono-objective PSO-based strategies that minimizes only classification error. Overall, results obtained with the MOPSO strategy reveal the importance of optimizing parameters and network for each problem, where both error and resources are minimized during fitness evaluation.

In this paper, an algorithm for blind digital modulation identification for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is proposed. The suggested algorithm is verified using higher order statistical moments and cumulants of the received signal. A multi-layer neural network trained with resilient backpropagation learning algorithm is proposed as a classifier. The purpose is to discriminate among different M-ary shift keying linear modulation types and the modulation order without any priori signal information. This study covers different MIMO systems with and without channel state information (CSI). The proposed classifier is evaluated through the probability of identification where we show that our proposed algorithm is capable of identifying the modulation scheme with high accuracy in excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.

The control algorithm determines the optimal value of torque controlling current component as a function of change in output power. The error between the optimal values of torque current and actual current is utilized to train the ANFIS structure using error back propagation method. In the proposed work, an isolated wind-battery hybrid system is considered, where a boost chopper is used to control the PMSG. A buck-boost converter is used to maintain constant DC-Link voltage and to interface an efficient battery energy storage system (BESS) in order to meet fluctuating load demand under varying wind conditions.

Real-Time Five DOF Robot Control using a Decentralized Neural Backstepping Scheme	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTELLIGENT CONTROL	IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Control Applications Part of 2010 IEEE Multi-Conference on Systems and Control	SEP 08-10, 2010	Yokohama, JAPAN				DISCRETE-TIME; MANIPULATORS; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	This paper presents a discrete-time decentralized control scheme for trajectory tracking of a five degrees of freedom (DOF) redundant robot. A high order neural network (HONN) is used to approximate a decentralized control law designed by the backstepping technique as applied to a block strict feedback form (BSFF). The neural network learning is performed on-line by Kalman filtering. The controllers are designed for each joint using only local angular position and velocity measurements. These simple local joint controllers allow trajectory tracking with reduced computations. The applicability of the proposed scheme is illustrated via real-time implementation.

Task-Oriented and Study-Dependent Optimization of 3D and Fully 4D Reconstruction Parameters for [F-18]FDG Imaging	2010 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS)/Medical Imaging Conference (MIC)/17th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors	OCT 30-NOV 06, 2010	Knoxville, TN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, IEEE				3D and fully 4D dynamic PET iterative image reconstructions are usually performed with a predefined set of reconstruction parameters (number of iterations, level of smoothing, number and type of basis functions used in the 4D reconstruction). These parameters are often chosen without due attention to i) the specific task (reason for the scan) and ii) the unique characteristics of the acquired data at hand. For the task of functional parameter estimation (such as glucose metabolic rate), both the image reconstruction parameters and the statistics of the unique dataset have a significant impact on the final estimates. As such, there is a need for a more systematic approach to reconstruction parameter selection. This work investigates the impact of using both 3D and fully 4D reconstruction on kinetic parameter estimation (influx rate constant (K-i)) for an [F-18]FDG brain imaging data set acquired on the high resolution research tomograph (HRRT). Using a data-subsetting approach, it is shown that the choice of iteration number significantly affects the final kinetic parameter estimates (influx rate constant (K-i)) and hence the iteration number can be more optimally selected for each unique data set to deliver lower errors in the parameter estimates. As such, the approach advocates a study-dependent and task-oriented early stopping of the EM algorithm.

In this paper, we adapt this work to the particular problem of predicting blood glucose levels based on near-infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy. We have focused this investigation on the combination (5000-4000 cm(-1)) and first-overtone (6500-5500 cm(-1)) spectral bands known to be dominated by glucose absorption information. An array of electrically pumped vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) is used to cover the two selected spectral bands; with each laser diode emitting light at a specific wavelength. A Quantum well infrared (QWI) photodetector operating in the 1.2-2.5 mu m range is used for optical power detection. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) based model is used to determine the glucose concentrations from the obtained blood absorption spectra.

New adaptive controller method for SMA hysteresis modelling of a morphing wing	AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							DESIGN	A neuro-fuzzy controller method for smart material actuator (SMA) hysteresis modelling is presented, conceived for a morphing wing application. The controller correlates each set of forces and electrical currents that are applied to the smart material actuators with the actuator elongation. The actuator is experimentally tested for four forces, using a variable electrical Current. The final controller is obtained through the Matlab/Simulink integration of three independent neuro-fuzzy controllers, designed for the increase and decrease of electrical current, and for null electrical current in the cooling phase of the actuator. This final controller gives a very small error with respect to the experimental values.	[Grigorie, T. L.; Botez, R.

We conducted an experiment in which we exposed 17 learners to a set of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while their electrical brain activity was recorded. We got 33.106 recordings. In an exploratory study we examined the influence of 24 picture categories from the IAPS on the amplitude variations of the 4 brainwaves frequency bands: delta, phi, alpha and beta. We used machine learning techniques to track the amplitudes in order to predict the dominant frequency band which inform about the learner mental and emotional states. Correlation and regression analyses show a significant impact of the emotional stimuli on the amplitudes of the brainwave frequency bands. Standard classification techniques were used to assess the reliability of the automatic prediction of the dominant frequency band. The reached accuracy was 90%.

Although young bilinguals appear to access both languages simultaneously (i.e., non-selective access), little is known about language selection in older adults. The effect of language context on language selectivity was investigated using interlingual homographs (IH; i.e., words with identical orthography but distinct semantic features in two languages, e.g., coin meaning 'corner' in French and 'money' in English). Younger and older French/English bilinguals were presented with triplets of letter strings comprised of a language context cue, an IH, and a target word, in a lexical decision semantic priming task. RT and ERP results support non-selective language access in young adults; however, the older bilinguals used the language context cue to bias their reading of the IH. Results are discussed in terms of age-related changes in language processing and context use in bilinguals.

However, most reported ANN methods only utilize condition monitoring data from failure histories, and ignore data obtained from suspension histories in which equipments are taken out of service before they fail. Suspension history condition monitoring data contains useful information revealing the degradation of equipment, and will help to achieve more accurate remaining useful life prediction if properly used, particularly when there are very limited failure histories, which is the case in many applications. In this paper, we develop an ANN approach utilizing both failure and suspension condition monitoring histories. The ANN model uses age and condition monitoring data as inputs and the life percentage as output. For each suspension history, the optimal predicted life is determined which can minimize the validation mean square error in the training process using the suspension history and the failure histories. Then the ANN is trained using the failure histories and all the suspension histories with the obtained optimal predicted life values, and the trained ANN can be used for remaining useful life prediction of other equipments. The key idea behind this approach is that the underlying relationship between the inputs and output of ANN is the same for all failure and suspension histories, and thus the optimal life for a suspension history is the one resulting in the lowest ANN validation error. The proposed approach is validated using vibration monitoring data collected from pump bearings in the field.

Here, we review a growing body of neurophysiological data that is difficult to reconcile with this influential theoretical perspective. As an alternative foundation for interpreting neural data, we consider frameworks borrowed from ethology, which emphasize the kinds of real-time interactive behaviors that animals have engaged in for millions of years. In particular, we discuss an ethologically-inspired view of interactive behavior as simultaneous processes that specify potential motor actions and select between them. We review how recent neurophysiological data from diverse cortical and subcortical regions appear more compatible with this parallel view than with the classical view of serial information processing stages.

In cognitive psychology, the malleable nature of long-term memory has been extensively documented. Distortions, such as the misinformation effect or hindsight bias, illustrate that memories can be easily changed, often without their owner taking notice. On the other hind, effects like hypermnesia demonstrate that memory might be more reliable than these distortions suggest. In the neuroscience field, similar observations were obtained mostly from animal studies. Research on memory consolidation suggested that memories become progressively resistant to amnesic treatments over time, but the reconsolidation phenomenon showed that this stability can be transiently lifted when these memories are reactivated, i.e., retrieved. Surprisingly, both research traditions have not taken much notice of each others' advances in understanding memory dynamics. We apply concepts developed in neuroscience to phenomena revealed in cognitive psychology to illustrate how these twins separated at birth may be reunited again.

J	Ansaldo, AI; Saidi, LG; Ruiz, A				Ansaldo, Ana Ines; Saidi, Ladan Ghazi; Ruiz, Adelaida			Model-driven intervention in bilingual aphasia: Evidence from a case of pathological language mixing	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article						Bilingual aphasia; Intervention; Model-based; Pathological switching	NAMING TREATMENT; RECOVERY; THERAPY; SPEECH; BRAIN; FMRI	Background: Speech-language pathologists are meeting an increasing number of bilingual clients. This poses a special challenge to clinical practice, given that bilingualism adds to the complexity of aphasia patterns and clinical decisions must be made accordingly. One question that has come to the attention of clinical aphasiologists is that of the language in which therapy should be administered. This issue becomes particularly relevant in cases of involuntary language switching, when choosing between L1 and L2 implies inhibiting one of the languages. Models of lexical selection in bilingual people offer a rationale for language choice based on the specificities of bilingual aphasia within each client. Aims: To provide evidence for model-based intervention in bilingual aphasia, particularly in cases of pathological language switching. Methods Procedures: This paper reports a model-driven intervention in a case of involuntary language switching following aphasia in a Spanish-English bilingual client. Outcomes Results: Intervention tailored to the client's strengths resulted in improved communication skills thanks to the implementation of a self-regulated strategy to overcome involuntary language switching. Conclusions: Model-driven descriptions of bilingual aphasia contribute to efficient intervention by identifying therapy approaches that take account of each client's language abilities. Further, clinical data analysed within models of bilingual language processing can provide evidence for dissociations between components of the bilingual lexical system.

These epigenetic mechanisms, which alter gene expression via alternative mechanisms to the coding DNA sequence, result from environmental effects acting on the genome. Studies in rodents indicate that variation in the early environment will trigger these epigenetic modifications and recent human data suggest the same may be true in humans.The expression of a number of genes, which are involved in normal brain functions and that have been shown to be under epigenetic control, seem to be dysregulated in suicide. The present review briefly describes the main epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression and discusses recent findings of epigenetic alterations in suicidal behavior.

We quantified the discrimination thresholds for reverberations that are representative for large rooms such as concert halls (reverberation times around 1.8 s). For exponential decays, simulating an ideal simple room, thresholds are around 6% (Experiment 1). We found no difference in thresholds between a short noise burst and a male voice spoken word, suggesting that discrimination is not dependent on the type, or spectral content, of the sound source (Experiment 2). In two further experiments using a magnitude estimation paradigm we assessed the perceived amount of reverberation as a function of various types of stimuli. Whereas the discrimination of reverberant stimuli does not seem to be affected by the sound stimulus, the perceived amount of reverberation is affected. Vocal stimuli are perceived as being more reverberant than non-vocal stimuli. The results are discussed in light of current neuroscientific models of auditory processing of complex stimuli but also with respect to their consequences for the use of reverberation in auditory display.

In this model, a simple rule specifies how the activation of each muscle is adapted from one movement to the next. Simulations of multijoint arm movements with a neuromuscular plant that incorporates neural delays, reflexes, and signal-dependent noise, demonstrate that the controller is able to compensate for changing internal or environment dynamics and noise properties. The computational model adapts by learning both the appropriate forces and required limb impedance to compensate precisely for forces and instabilities in arbitrary directions with patterns similar to those observed in motor learning experiments. It learns to regulate reciprocal activation and co-activation in a redundant muscle system during repeated movements without requiring any explicit transformation from hand to muscle space. Independent error-driven change in the activation of each muscle results in a coordinated control of the redundant muscle system and in a behavior that reduces instability, systematic error, and energy.

Many uncertainties remain, however, about the exact moment in the human lineage when these abilities evolved. This article argues that cooperation and culture did not evolve in one step in the human lineage and that the capacity to stick to long-term and risky cooperative arrangements evolved before properly modern culture. I present evidence that Homo heidelbergensis became increasingly able to secure contributions form others in two demanding Paleolithic public good games (PPGGs): cooperative feeding and cooperative breeding. I argue that the temptation to defect is high in these PPGGs and that the evolution of human cooperation in Homo heidelberngensis is best explained by the emergence of modern-like abilities for inhibitory control and goal maintenance. These executive functions are localized in the prefrontal cortex and allow humans to stick to social norms in the face of competing motivations. This scenario is consistent with data on brain evolution that indicate that the largest growth of the prefrontal cortex in human evolution occurred in Homo heidelbergensis and was followed by relative stasis in this part of the brain. One implication of this argument is that subsequent behavioral innovations, including the evolution of symbolism, art, and properly cumulative culture in modern Homo sapiens, are unlikely to be related to a reorganization of the prefrontal cortex, despite frequent claims to the contrary in the literature on the evolution of human culture and cognition.

It has been shown to promote wound healing in the skin and other non-neural tissues, however, its role in central nervous system injury was not known. We now report a beneficial role for secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor after spinal cord injury. After spinal cord contusion injury in mice, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor is expressed primarily by astrocytes and neutrophils but not macrophages. We show, using transgenic mice over-expressing secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, that this molecule has an early protective effect after spinal cord contusion injury. Furthermore, wild-type mice treated for the first week after spinal cord contusion injury with recombinant secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor exhibit sustained improvement in locomotor control and reduced secondary tissue damage. Recombinant secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor injected intraperitoneally localizes to the nucleus of circulating leukocytes, is detected in the injured spinal cord, reduces activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Administration of recombinant secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor might therefore be useful for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.

The aim of this study was to investigate the left language-related cerebral pathways in semantic dementia using diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography and to combine the findings with cortical anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained during a reading activation task. The left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate fasciculus and fronto-parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus were tracked in five semantic dementia patients and eight healthy controls. The left uncinate fasciculus and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum were also obtained for comparison with previous studies. From each tract, mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, as well as parallel and transverse diffusivities were obtained. Diffusion tensor imaging results were related to grey and white matter atrophy volume assessed by voxel-based morphometry and functional magnetic resonance imaging activations during a reading task. Semantic dementia patients had significantly higher mean diffusivity, parallel and transverse in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. The arcuate and uncinate fasciculi demonstrated significantly higher mean diffusivity, parallel and transverse and significantly lower fractional anisotropy. The fronto-parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus was relatively spared, with a significant difference observed for transverse diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, only. In the corpus callosum, the genu showed lower fractional anisotropy compared with controls, while no difference was found in the splenium. The left parietal cortex did not show significant volume changes on voxel-based morphometry and demonstrated normal functional magnetic resonance imaging activation in response to reading items that stress sublexical phonological processing. This study shows that semantic dementia is associated with anatomical damage to the major superior and inferior temporal white matter connections of the left hemisphere likely involved in semantic and lexical processes, with relative sparing of the fronto-parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus. Fronto-parietal regions connected by this tract were activated normally in the same patients during sublexical reading. These findings contribute to our understanding of the anatomical changes that occur in semantic dementia, and may further help to explain the dissociation between marked single-word and object knowledge deficits, but sparing of phonology and fluency in semantic dementia.

The immature forelimbs of the newborn perform rhythmic and alternating movements that are likely under spinal control. The hind-limbs start moving in the second week. Chemical synapses are scant in the spinal enlargements of neonatal opossums and the presence of electrochemical synapses has not been evaluated in this species or in other marsupials. As a first step aiming at evaluating the existence of such synapses in the neonatal spinal cord, we have investigated the presence of the exclusively neuronal gap junction protein connexin36 (Cx36) by immunohistochemistry in light microscopy. At birth, Cx36 immunoreactivity is moderate in the presumptive gray matter in both enlargements. Thereafter, it decreases gradually, except in the superficial dorsal horn where it increases to a plateau between P10 and P20. Cx36 labeling is detected in the presumptive white matter at birth, but then decreases except in the dorsal part of the lateral funiculus, where it is dense between P10 and P20. Cx36 has become virtually undetectable by P52. The presence of Cx36 in the spinal enlargements of postnatal opossums suggests that neurons might be linked by gap junctions at a time when chemical synapses are only beginning to form. The greater abundance of Cx36 observed transiently in the superficial dorsal horn suggests a stronger involvement of this protein in spinal sensory systems than in direct motor control of the limbs.

It involves generating a pseudo-ultrasound (pseudo-US) from a segmented MR image and uses cross-correlation as the cost function to register with ultrasound. The algorithm's performance is compared to a state-of-the-art technique that uses a median filtered MR images to register with a Gaussian-blurred ultrasound using normalized mutual information (NMI). The two methods are tested on nine tumor cases, including both high- and low-grade gliomas. The pseudo-US method yielded significantly better alignment average than that obtained by NMI (p = 0.0009). If one case where NMI failed is excluded, the mean distance obtained by the pseudo-US approach (2.6 mm) is slightly lower than the one obtained by NMI (2.8mm), but not significantly so (p = 0.16). We conclude that the pseudo-US method is more robust for these cases.	[Mercier, Laurence; Fonov, Vladimir; Collins, D.

BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Olfaction; smell test; UPSIT; Alberta smell test; mild head injury	HEAD TRAUMA; IDENTIFICATION TEST; DEPRESSION; DYSFUNCTION; DISORDERS; SEVERITY; ANOSMIA; TASTE	Primary objective: Olfactory functions are not systematically evaluated following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study aimed at comparing two smell tests that are used in a clinical setting. Research design: The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and the Alberta Smell Test were compared in terms of assessment time, cost and diagnosis. Parameters associated with olfactory loss such as injury severity, type of cerebral lesion and depressive data were considered. Forty-nine TBI patients admitted to an outpatient rehabilitation programme took part in this experiment. Results: The scores of the two smell tests were significantly correlated. Both tests indicated that patients with frontal lesion performed significantly worse than patients with other types of lesion. Mood and injury severity were not associated with olfactory impairment when age was taken into account. Between 40-44% of the patients showing olfactory impairments were not aware of their deficit. Conclusions: Since a significant proportion of the patients showing olfactory impairments were not aware of their deficit, it is recommended than clinicians systematically evaluate olfactory functions using the Alberta Smell test. To refine their diagnosis, the UPSIT can also be used.

Such networks regroup many types of organizations that could have different perceptions of network performance. No study has explored the perceptions of traumatic brain injury (TBI) network participants regarding network performance. Objective: To document the perceptions of TBI network participants concerning the importance of different dimensions of performance and to explore whether these perceptions vary according to organization types. Methodology: Participants of network organizations were surveyed using a questionnaire based on a conceptual framework of performance (the EGIPSS framework). Results: Network organizations reported dimensions related to goal attainment to be more important than dimensions related to process. Differences existed between the perceptions of various types of network organizations for some but not all domains and dimensions of performance. Conclusion: Network performance appears different from the performance of an individual organization and the consideration of the various organizations' perceptions in clarifying this concept should improve its comprehensiveness and its acceptability by all stakeholders.

Research design: Exploratory descriptive qualitative study. Methods and procedures: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three adolescents who had suffered a moderate TBI and with their parents. In addition, a focus group was conducted with four professionals. Main outcomes and results: The results show that the perceptions of adolescents, as well as their parents, affect different aspects of their lives, such as the adolescent's personal experiences, the family, friends, the environment and school. A great number of repercussions were indeed noted, which facilitate and sometimes limit the social inclusion of these adolescents. In general, the professionals shared the same perceptions, but added some ideas that did not come up in interviews with the adolescents and their parents. Conclusions: The results of this study should enable health professionals to better understand the social inclusion experienced by these people. They should also provide professionals with guidelines on how to better support the social inclusion of adolescents with TBIs and help families cope with this difficult situation.

Research design: This descriptive, comparative retrospective cohort study included 415 patients with moderate and severe TBI secondary to an assault (n = 91) vs a motor vehicle collision (n = 324). Methods and procedures: Outcome measures were length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit and in hospital, Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), FIM (R) instrument ('FIM')dagger and discharge destination. Main outcomes and results: Patients with TBI from MVC had a higher percentage of polytrauma, higher injury severity scores, required more orthopaedic surgeries and thoracic drain insertions. Patients with TBI from assault were more often non-Caucasian, young single men, less educated with higher unemployment rates and criminal records, with a history of alcohol and drug abuse and were more often intoxicated on admission. There was no significant group difference in the LOS and FIM ratings, but patients with assault-related TBI were more often discharged home and had a more favourable GOS-E. Conclusion: Variables such as injury severity, age, level of intoxication on admission and presence of surgeries should be considered when determining acute outcome.

The aim of this study was to correlate performance on the CDT with the presence of acute traumatic cerebral injuries sustained after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 170 patients with TBI of all severity admitted to an acute care setting. These patients sustained different types of injuries (epidural haematoma, subdural haematoma, subarachnoid haemorrhage, intraparenchymal haematoma and brain oedema) in different sites (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobes, bilateral and right or left hemisphere). Results: The CDT total score was significantly lower for subjects presenting subarachnoid haemorrhage (4.80 +/- 3.34 vs 7.04 +/- 3.14, t(168df) 4.477, p < 0.001) and for those presenting brain oedema (4.50 +/- 3.06 vs 6.69 +/- 3.38, t(168df) = 4.214, p < 0.001), parietal injury (5.15 +/- 3.17 vs 6.42 +/- 3.52, t(168df) = 2.416, p = 0.017) or bilateral injuries (5.28 +/- 3.31 vs 6.62 +/- 3.44, t(168df) = 2.569, p = 0.011) compared to those who did not. Conclusion: This study provides empirical evidence of the relationship between TBIs and results on the CDT, supporting previous studies done with other populations.

Given the ubiquitous nature of rhythms, it is surprising that we know very little of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that produce them in the embryos and of their potential role during the development of neuronal circuits. Recently, zebrafish has been developed as a vertebrate model to study the genetics of neural development. Zebrafish offer several advantages to the study of nervous system development including optical and electrophysiological analysis of neuronal activity even at the earliest embryonic stages. This unique combination of physiology and genetics in the same animal model has led to insights into the development of neuronal networks. This chapter reviews work on the development of zebrafish motor rhythms and speculates on birth and maturation of the circuits that produce them.

Like many trigeminal brainstem neurons, those of NVsnpr are rhythmically active in phase with fictive mastication in vivo (Tsuboi et al., 2003) and project directly to the trigeminal motoneurons (Kolta et al., 2000), but in contrast with the others, they are the only neurons with intrinsic bursting abilities (Sandler et al., 1998; Brocard et al., 2006) within the minimal area of the brainstem necessary to produce rhythmic activity in trigeminal nerves (Bourque and Kolta, 2001). Development of bursting in NVsnpr neurons closely follows the development of mastication. It is mediated by a persistent Na(+) current (I(NaP)) that is expressed only within a certain membrane potential range and that is modulated by the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](e)), the lower the concentration, the larger the magnitude of I(NaP). Under physiological [ Ca(2+)](e), bursting can also be induced in vitro by repetitive electrical stimulation of the trigeminal sensory tract, which projects massively to NVsnpr or by local applications of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. Both types of stimuli also depolarize glial cells recorded in NVsnpr and increase coupling between them. Glial cells play a determinant role in setting [Ca(2+)](e) and hence are in a key position to influence NVsnpr neuronal firing pattern.

However, the body movements play important roles during locomotion: they produce the thrust during undulatory locomotion and they help to increase the stride length during legged locomotion. In this chapter, we review our current knowledge about the flexibility in the neuronal circuits controlling the body musculature during locomotion. We focus especially on salamander because, as an amphibian, this animal is able to display a rich repertoire of aquatic and terrestrial locomotor modes.

For instance, respiration increases in association with exercise. In this chapter, we review the mechanisms underlying respiratory changes during exercise. Three specific hypotheses were proposed. First, the chemoreception hypothesis suggests that chemoreceptors located centrally or peripherally modify breathing by detecting metabolic changes in arterial blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Second, the central command hypothesis stipulates that central neural connections from brain motor areas activate the respiratory centers during exercise. Third, the neural feedback hypothesis stipulates that sensory inputs from the contracting limb muscles modulate the respiratory centers during exercise. We present evidence from the literature supporting possible contributions from these three mechanisms. This review also addresses future research challenges relative to respiratory modulation during exercise.

These neural networks are intrinsically capable of generating coordinated patterns of rhythmic activity in the absence of sensory feedback or descending command from higher brain centers. Rhythmogenesis in these neural circuits lies on several mechanisms, both at the cellular and the network levels. In this chapter, we compare the anatomical organization of the axial networks, the role of identified spinal neurons, and their interactions in rhythmogenesis in four species: lamprey, zebrafish, Xenopus tadpole, and salamander. The comparison suggests that several principles in axial network design are phylogenetically conserved among vertebrates.

The CNS requires less extensive neurological evaluation and is quicker and simpler to administer. Objective: Our aim was to develop and validate a simple conversion model from the CNS to the NIHSS. Methods: A conversion model was developed using data from a consecutive series of acute-stroke patients who were scored using both scales. The model was then validated in an external dataset in which all patients were prospectively assessed for stroke severity using both scales by different observers which consisted of neurology residents or stroke fellows. Results: In all, 168 patients were included in the model development, with a median age of 73 years (20-94). Men constituted 51.8%. The median NIHSS score was 6 (0-31). The median CNS score was 8.5 (1.5-11.5). The relationship between CNS and NIHSS could be expressed as the formula: NIHSS = 23 - 2 x CNS. A cohort of 350 acute-stroke patients with similar characteristics was used for model validation. There was a highly significant positive correlation between the observed and predicted NIHSS score (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). The predicted NIHSS score was on average 0.61 higher than the observed NIHSS score (95% CI = 0.31-0.91). Conclusions: The CNS can be reliably converted to the NIHSS using a simple conversion formula: NIHSS = 23 -2 x CNS. This finding may have a practical impact by permitting reliable comparisons with NIHSS-based evaluations and simplifying the routine assessment of acute-stroke patients in more diverse settings.

Maternal sensitivity, mind-mindedness and autonomy support were assessed when children were 12 to 15 months old (N = 80). Child EF was assessed at 18 and 26 months. All three parenting dimensions were found to relate to child EF. Autonomy support was the strongest predictor of EF at each age, independent of general cognitive ability and maternal education. These findings add to previous results on child stress-response systems in suggesting that parent-child relationships may play an important role in children's developing self-regulatory capacities.

In a typical HTS campaign, the main objective consists of the identification of active compounds, called hits. We discuss the possibility of using machine learning methods to predict experimental HTS measurements. Such a virtual HTS analysis will be based on the results of real HTS campaigns carried out with similar compound libraries and similar drug targets. In this way, we analyze an experimental HTS assay from McMaster Data Mining and Docking Competition (Elowe et al. 2005) by means of decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines. First, we study separately the molecular and atomic descriptors in order to establish which of them provide a better discrimination. We present and discuss the results provided by machine learning methods in terms of identification of false positive and false negative hits.

Neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment and self-evaluation of post-concussive symptoms were done at 2 weeks post trauma. Patients with complicated MTBI were more likely to show auditory and vestibular system dysfunction. Surprisingly, the uncomplicated group reported more severe post-concussive symptoms than patients with positive CT scans. The groups showed no other difference in neurological, psychological, or cognitive outcome. A complete neurological examination should be done acutely in patients with MTBI to determine more specific follow-up required.

To assess the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) in the management of poisoned patients. Methods. We performed a systematic review of the literature with no time or language restriction. The electronic databases were searched from their inception until June 1, 2009 (Medline, EMBASE, ISI web of science, Biological abstract, LILACS, ChemIndex, Toxnet, and Proquest). We also examined the references of identified articles and the gray literature. The target interventions eligible for inclusion were administration of any IFE before, during, or after poisoning in human or animals. All types of studies were reviewed. Eligibility for inclusion and study quality scores, based on criteria by Jadad and the STROBE statement, were evaluated by independent investigators. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included neurologic, hemodynamic, and electrocardiographic variables, as well as adverse effects. Results. Of the 938 publications identified by the search strategies, 74 met the inclusion criteria. We identified 23 animal trials, 50 human, and 1 animal case reports. Overall, the quality of evidence was weak and significant heterogeneity prevented data pooling. Available data suggest some benefits of IFE in bupivacaine, verapamil, chlorpromazine, and some tricyclic antidepressants and beta-blockers toxicity. No trial assessed the safety of IFE in the treatment of acute poisoning. Conclusion. The evidence for the efficacy of IFE in reducing mortality and improving hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and neurological parameters in the poisoned patients is solely based on animal studies and human case reports. The safety of IFE has not been established.

In several randomized, double-blind trials of up to 28 weeks' duration in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Cerebrolysin was superior to placebo in improving global outcome measures and cognitive ability. A large, randomized comparison of Cerebrolysin, donepezil or combination therapy showed beneficial effects on global measures and cognition for all three treatment groups compared with baseline. Although not as extensively studied in patients with vascular dementia, Cerebrolysin has also shown beneficial effects on global measures and cognition in this patient population. Cerebrolysin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with dizziness (or vertigo) being the most frequently reported adverse event. Although further studies with Cerebrolysin, including longer term trials and further exploration of its use in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors, are needed to more clearly determine its place in the management of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, available data suggest that Cerebrolysin is a useful addition to the treatment options available for dementia.

Probably not. However, this small nine amino acid peptide is involved in a wide variety of physiological and pathological functions such as sexual activity, penile erection, ejaculation, pregnancy, uterus contraction, milk ejection, maternal behavior, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer, social bonding, and stress, which makes oxytocin and its receptor potential candidates as targets for drug therapy. In this review, we address the issues of drug design and specificity and focus our discussion on recent findings on oxytocin and its heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor OTR. In this regard, we will highlight the following topics: (i) the role of oxytocin in behavior and affectivity, (ii) the relationship between oxytocin and stress with emphasis on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, (iii) the involvement of oxytocin in pain regulation and nociception, (iv) the specific action mechanisms of oxytocin on intracellular Ca2+ in the hypothalamo neurohypophysial system (HNS) cell bodies, (v) newly generated transgenic rats tagged by a visible fluorescent protein to study the physiology of vasopressin and oxytocin, and (vi) the action of the neurohypophysial hormone outside the central nervous system, including the myometrium, heart and peripheral nervous system. As a short nine amino acid peptide, closely related to its partner peptide vasopressin, oxytocin appears to be ideal for the design of agonists and antagonists of its receptor. In addition, not only the hormone itself and its binding to OTR, but also its synthesis, storage and release can be endogenously and exogenously regulated to counteract pathophysiological states. Understanding the fundamental physiopharmacology of the effects of oxytocin is an important and necessary approach for developing a potential pharmacotherapy.

The pathophysiology of respiratory failure and the potential risks of iNO differ substantially in preterm infants, necessitating study in this population. Objectives To determine the effect of treatment with iNO on death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and neurodevelopmental disability in preterm newborn infants with respiratory disease. Search strategy Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library) were searched covering the years from 1985 to 2010. In addition, the abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies were also searched. Selection criteria Randomized and quasi-randomized studies in preterm infants with respiratory disease that compared the effects of iNO gas to control, with or without placebo were eligible. Data collection and analysis Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. Main results Fourteen randomized controlled trials of inhaled nitric oxide therapy in preterm infants were found. The trials have been grouped post hoc into three categories depending on entry criteria; entry in the first three days of life based on oxygenation criteria, routine use in preterm babies with pulmonary disease, and later enrolment based on an increased risk of BPD. No overall analyses were performed. Nine trials of early rescue treatment of infants based on oxygenation criteria demonstrated no significant effect of iNO on mortality or BPD. Three studies with routine use of iNO in infants with pulmonary disease also demonstrated no significant reduction in death or BPD [typical RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.01)] although this small effect approached significance. Later treatment with iNO based on the risk of BPD (two trials) demonstrated no significant benefit for this outcome in analyses which are possible using summary data. There is no clear effect of iNO on the frequency of all grades of IVH or of severe IVH. Early rescue treatment was associated with a non-significant 20% increase in severe IVH. No effect on the incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment was found. Authors' conclusions iNO as rescue therapy for the very ill preterm infant does not appear to be effective. Early routine use of iNO in preterm infants with respiratory disease does not affect serious brain injury or improve survival without BPD. Later use of iNO to prevent BPD might be effective, but requires further study.

These children are known to have lower IQs than their full-term peers, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. We designed a developmental connectionist model of the Raven Matrices IQ task in which (1) all neurons had intact output, simulating normal development, or (2) half the neurons had noisy output, simulating noisy transmission or WMD, or (3) half the neurons had no output, simulating cell death or GMD. We found that damage increased task error. Further, WMD was worse than GMD overall, yet GMD was at once worse for generalization problems not given in training and better for training problems. Our model is the first to simulate an effect of perinatal brain damage on a cognitive task, and predicts that different types of brain damage may lead to different cognitive impairments.

Using sibling-descendant cascade-correlation networks, we found that prototype effects were more prominent at the beginning of training and decreased with further training. In contrast, exemplar effects steadily increased with learning. Both kinds of effects were also influenced by category structure. Well-differentiated categories encouraged prototype abstraction while poorly structured categories promoted example memorization.

The aim of the present study was to compare spatial working memory performance of females and males schizophrenia patients to verify whether the sexual dimorphism of spatial abilities present in the general population is found also in schizophrenia. Methods. We analysed different types of errors committed by each gender on the spatial working memory test of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery to determine potential differences between them. Results. Despite the lack of difference in the number of errors between men and women, different profiles of errors were associated with the strategy used according to gender. The men's strategy was better compared to women. Specifically, for women strategy score correlated positively with searches in previously visited boxes, whereas for men it correlated with both previously visited boxes and never visited ones. However, men's strategy is more impaired by the number of revisits in boxes in which tokens have previously been found than female's one. Conclusions. These results suggested impaired either central executive and/or visuospatial sketchpad of working memory in patients with schizophrenia. We demonstrated also that the worsening of strategy in men is principally due to central executive deficits compared to women with schizophrenia. The study of sex differences in cognitive performances could help in delineating partially different endophenotypes of schizophrenia in men and women.

However, the particles are more challenging to make water-soluble, show broader emission spectra than most quantum dots, and their behavior in living cells is largely unknown. In this work we solubilize InP nanocrystals with simple thiols (mercaptopropionic acid) and conjugate them to the neurotransmitter dopamine or the protein transferrin. Degree of uptake and labeling patterns of QDs alone, QD-dopamine, and QD-transferrin are compared in different cell lines and toxicity is evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay.

We have presented an automatic method for MI location detection by Neural Network classification of BSPM data. Data used here contain BSPM signal of four patients and their actual infarcted segments (two training cases and two cases for test). By mapping Q-wave integral and QRS-complex integral on torso surface and applying four threshold-based rules, an abnormal area on the torso can be obtain. This detected abnormal area then is mapped to the heart segments. A NN classifier is used at final step. The results expressed by parameter OS (overlapped segment) which is a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is a perfect match. The results for two test cases are OScase#3=0.7 and OScase#4=0.4 shows this mathematicaly simple method can predict the location of MI reasonably. However further works is needed to improve the results.

It is unclear, however, what the specific contribution of each of these areas is. it is also unclear whether the response selection process operates independent of response modality or whether a number of specialized processes are recruited depending on the behaviour of interest. In the present study, the neural substrates for different response selection modes (volitional and stimulus-driven) were compared, using sparse-sampling functional magnetic resonance imaging, for two different response modalities: words and comparable oral motor gestures. Results demonstrate that response selection relies on a network of prefrontal, premotor and parietal areas, with the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) at the core of the process. Overall, this network is sensitive to the manner in which responses are selected, despite the absence of a medio-lateral axis, as was suggested by Goldberg (1985). In contrast, this network shows little sensitivity to the modality of the response, suggesting of a domain-general selection process. Theoretical implications of these results are discussed.

The Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score has been validated in order to describe and quantify the severity of organ dysfunction (OD). There are several physiological differences between neonates and older children. The objective of the study was to determine whether there are differences in incidence of ODs and mortality rate between full-term neonates (age <28 days) and older children. Methods: In a prospective, observational study, 1806 patients, admitted to seven PICUs between September 1998 and February 2000 were included. The PELOD score, which includes six organ dysfunctions and 12 variables, was recorded daily. For each variable, the most abnormal value was used to define the daily OD. For each OD, the most abnormal value each day and that during the entire stay were used in calculating the daily PELOD and PELOD scores, respectively. The relationships between OD, daily OD, PELOD, daily PELOD and mortality were compared between the two strata (neonates, older children) based on the discrimination power, logistic and multiple regression analyses. Results: Of the 1806 enrolled patients 171 (9.5%) were neonates. Incidence of MODS and mortality rate were higher among neonates than in older children (14.6% vs. 5.5%, P < 10(-7); 75.4%, vs. 50.9%, P < 10(-4); respectively). Daily PELOD scores were significantly higher in neonates from day 1 to day 4. Daily cardiovascular, respiratory and renal dysfunction scores from day 1 to day 4 as well as the PELOD score for the entire pediatric intensive care unit stay were also significantly higher in neonates. Neurological, cardiovascular, and hepatic dysfunctions were independent predictors of death among neonates while all ODs significantly contributed to the risk of mortality in older children. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that incidence of MODS and mortality rate are higher among neonates compared to older children. Neurological, cardiovascular, and hepatic dysfunctions were the only significant contributors to neonatal mortality. Stratification for neonates versus older children might be useful in clinical trials where MODS is considered as an outcome measure.

Consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of well-differentiated gastroenterohepatic neuroendocrine tumours: a revised statement from a Canadian National Expert Group	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Carcinoid tumour; carcinoid syndrome; carcinoid heart disease; neuroendocrine tumours; guidelines; clinical management; diagnosis; surgery		Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (netspreviously called "carcinoid tumours") are relatively rare tumours originating from the diffuse neuroendocrine system; they are found most often in the bronchial or gastrointestinal systems. In Canada, gastroenterohepatic nets represent less than 0.25% of oncology cases. Because of the relative rarity of these tumours, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches vary and are often based on individual physician experience. A number of European and North American groups have developed consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of well-differentiated gastroenterohepatic nets, and in 2006, Canadian consensus guidelines were published by a Canadian expert group. The updated and expanded current Canadian guidelines are based on a consensus meeting held in Paris, France, in 2008 and are based on the most current literature.

Objective: Our purpose was to clarify if the epsilon 2 allele affects regional cortical thicknesses and volumes. Methods: Regional cortical thicknesses and volumes were measured with an automated pipeline in 109 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, 114 AD patients and 105 age-matched healthy controls. Results: In the mild cognitive impairment group, the epsilon 2 carriers had thicker regional cortices at the transverse temporal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus than the subjects with epsilon 3/epsilon 3, and a larger cerebral gray matter and smaller lateral ventricles than the epsilon 3/epsilon 3 and epsilon 4 carriers. In the AD group, the epsilon 2 carriers had significantly thicker entorhinal and transverse temporal cortices, a larger whole cerebral gray matter, and smaller lateral ventricles than the subjects with the epsilon 3/epsilon 3 genotype, and a significantly thicker entorhinal cortex and larger cerebral gray matter than epsilon 4 carriers. No APOE2 effect was found in the control group. Conclusion: The APOE epsilon 2 allele is associated with larger regional cortical thicknesses and volumes in mild cognitive impairment and AD.

By contrast, relatively little is known about FGF in this process. In this report we identify an FGF-receptor-dependent pathway in zebrafish hindbrain neural progenitors that give rise to somatic motoneurons, oligodendrocyte progenitors and differentiating astroglia. Using a combination of chemical and genetic approaches to conditionally inactivate FGF-receptor signalling, we investigate the role of this pathway. We show that FGF-receptor signalling is not essential for the survival or maintenance of hindbrain neural progenitors but controls their fate by coordinately regulating key transcription factors. First, by cooperating with Shh, FGF-receptor signalling controls the expression of olig2, a patterning gene essential for the specification of somatic motoneurons and oligodendrocytes. Second, FGF-receptor signalling controls the development of both oligodendrocyte progenitors and astroglia through the regulation of sox9, a gliogenic transcription factor the function of which we show to be conserved in the zebrafish hindbrain. Overall, for the first time in vivo, our results reveal a mechanism of FGF in the control of neural cell diversity.

The SAD kinases are crucial for establishing the axon-dendrite identity across species. Previous studies suggest that a tumour suppressor kinase, LKB1, in the presence of a pseudokinase, STRAD alpha, initiates axonal differentiation and growth through activating the SAD kinases in vertebrate neurons. STRAD alpha was implicated in the localization, stabilization and activation of LKB1 in various cell culture studies. Its in vivo functions, however, have not been examined. In our present study, we analyzed the neuronal phenotypes of the first loss-of-function mutants for STRAD alpha and examined their genetic interactions with LKB1 and SAD in C. elegans. Unexpectedly, only the C. elegans STRAD alpha, STRD-1, functions exclusively through the SAD kinase, SAD-1, to regulate neuronal polarity and synaptic organization. Moreover, STRD-1 tightly associates with SAD-1 to coordinate its synaptic localizations. By contrast, the C. elegans LKB1, PAR-4, also functions in an additional genetic pathway independently of SAD-1 and STRD-1 to regulate neuronal polarity. We propose that STRD-1 establishes neuronal polarity and organizes synaptic proteins in a complex with the SAD-1 kinase. Our findings suggest that instead of a single, linear genetic pathway, STRAD alpha and LKB1 regulate neuronal development through multiple effectors that are shared in some cellular contexts but distinct in others.

Investigating the Association Between Early Life Parental Care and Stress Responsivity in Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							BONDING INSTRUMENT; MATERNAL-CARE; MENTAL-HEALTH; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; MAJOR DEPRESSION; SELF-ESTEEM; EXPERIENCE; NEUROGENESIS; ATTACHMENT; STABILITY	We explored the associations between early life experience, endocrine regulation, psychological health, and hippocampal integrity in 37 elderly volunteers. Specifically, a neurodevelopmental and psychological mediation model was tested: Retrospective early life parental care was hypothesized to influence hippocampal integrity and the development of self-esteem. In turn, hippocampal volume (via modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis negative feedback) and self-esteem (via modulation of stress vulnerability) were suggested to influence the cortisol stress response. Results supported the two-mediator model. We propose that early life parental care impacts on an individual's developing brain and personality, which consequently contribute to the shaping of neuroendocrine stress responsivity.

Methods: A search of 13 electronic databases identified all types of studies examining VR as an intervention for children with CP. The most recent article included was published in October 2008. For each study, the quality of the methods was assessed using the appropriate scale. A total of 19 articles were retrieved. Thirteen studies from 11 articles were included in the final analysis. Results: Outcomes documented brain reorganization/plasticity, motor capacity, visual-perceptual skills, social participation and personal factors. Two studies were randomized controlled trials. These reported conflicting results regarding motor outcomes. Twelve of the 13 studies presented positive outcomes in at least one domain. Conclusions: VR has potential benefits for children with CP. However, the current level of evidence is poor and empirical data is lacking. Future methodologically rigorous studies are required.

Using the sustained frequency following response (FFR) and the onset auditory brainstem responses (ABR) we evaluated if children with SLI show abnormalities at the brainstem level consistent with a temporal processing deficit. To this end, the neural encoding of tonal sweeps, as reflected in the FFR, for different rates of frequency change, and the effects of reducing inter-stimulus interval on the ABR components were evaluated in 10 4-11-year-old SLI children and their age-matched controls. Results for the SLI group showed degraded FFR phase-locked neural activity that failed to faithfully track the frequency change presented in the tonal sweeps, particularly at the faster sweep rates. SLI children also showed longer latencies for waves III and V of the ABR and a greater prolongation of wave III at high stimulus rates (> 30/sec), suggesting greater susceptibility to neural adaptation. These results taken together appear to suggest a disruption in the temporal pattern of phase-locked neural activity necessary to encode rapid frequency change and an increased susceptibility to desynchronizing factors related to faster rates of stimulus presentation in children with SLI.

Cytopathological Diagnosis of Adult Retinoblastoma in a Vitrectomy Specimen	DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article						retinoblastoma; vitrectomy; intraocular tumor; differential diagnosis	FINE-NEEDLE ASPIRATION; BIOPSY; CYTOLOGY; LECTURE; TUMORS	Retinoblastoma (RB) is extremely rare in adults. We describe a case of RB diagnosed by cytology in a vitrectomy specimen of a 23-year-old patient who presented with diminished visual acuity and retinal detachment in the absence of a clinically-visible mass. Cytological examination of the vitreous fluid showed clusters of loosely cohesive atypical cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and "salt and pepper" chromatin pattern in a background of normal neuronal retinal cells. Nuclear molding was present as well as numerous apoptotic bodies. The cells were focally positive for epithelial markers and showed strong and diffuse positivity for neuroendocrine markers. Ki-67 stained 90% of the "atypical cells" nuclei, in contrast to nonneoplastic retinal neuronal cells, which were negative for the marker. A diagnosis of RB was rendered, and subsequently was confirmed in the enucleation specimen. The cytological differential diagnosis is discussed as well as the role that cytology and immunohistochemistry can play in differentiating neoplastic cells from normal retinal cellular elements in vitreous fluid specimens.

J	Le Dorze, G; Signori, FH				Le Dorze, Guylaine; Signori, France-Helene			Needs, barriers and facilitators experienced by spouses of people with aphasia	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Rehabilitation; aphasia; spouses; brain injury; barriers and facilitators; adaptation	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; STROKE SURVIVORS; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; INFORMAL CARERS; MEDICAL-CARE; REHABILITATION; SUPPORT; CONSEQUENCES; DETERMINANTS; PERCEPTIONS	Purpose. Little is known about how spouses cope with their needs as a result of their partner's aphasia. This study described spouses' needs and identified the barriers and facilitators to satisfying them. Methods. Four associations of people with aphasia were approached. Eleven spouses were interviewed in small groups. They described the results of their inquiries and efforts to satisfy their needs because their partner had aphasia (mean time since onset 6 years 8 months) as a result of stroke or surgery. Discussions were transcribed and coded. Excerpts were grouped into categories. Results. Spouses mainly needed support and respite, and perceived their partner to need help for communication and wellbeing. Personal factors like the availability of close others to provide help were facilitating. However, participants encountered barriers, mainly organisational, i.e. the help needed did not exist. Some needs persisted over time. Conclusions. Results confirm the long-term needs of spouses in adjusting to the aphasia of their partner, as well as the limited services available to them. Many of the needs reflected spouses' concerns about their partner, while others were a consequence of their caregiving role as well as the unavailability of support. Spouses of people with aphasia should have access to support during and after rehabilitation.

J	Lussier, D; Richarz, L; Finco, G				Lussier, David; Richarz, Lite; Finco, Gabriele			Use of Hydromorphone, with Particular Reference to the OROS (R) Formulation, in the Elderly	DRUGS & AGING			English	Review							EXTENDED-RELEASE HYDROMORPHONE; NONMALIGNANT PAIN; DILAUDID(R) IR; GENERAL-POPULATION; BREAKTHROUGH PAIN; BODY-COMPOSITION; FAT DISTRIBUTION; DOSE-CONVERSION; CANCER PAIN; OPEN-LABEL	The prevalence of pain increases with age. However, pain is often inadequately managed in elderly people, which undermines quality of life. Pain has been associated with depression, sleep disturbances, impaired ambulation, and increased healthcare use and costs. Effective treatment of pain improves the overall quality of life. However, pain management is complicated by the presence of multiple co-morbidities in elderly people, which increases the likelihood of polypharmacy, and therefore increases the chance of potential drug-drug interactions. Polypharmacy is also associated with poor adherence to therapy. Age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes reduce the therapeutic index of drugs. Therefore, elderly people are more likely to suffer from adverse events and increased sensitivity to the analgesic properties of opioids. OROS (R) hydromorphone (Jurnista (R)) is a once-daily, extended-release formulation that uses the OROS (R) push-pull technology to provide controlled release of the semi-synthetic opioid hydromorphone. Compared with conventional immediate-release hydromorphone, OROS (R) hydromorphone provides more consistent delivery of hydromorphone with lower peak concentrations and less variability in plasma concentrations over time. The bioavailability of hydromorphone from OROS (R) hydromorphone is minimally affected by food or alcohol (ethanol). Hydromorphone is mainly metabolized in the liver and is excreted in the urine. Unlike morphine, hydromorphone does not have an active 6-glucuronide metabolite. This metabolite of morphine can accumulate in the presence of renal failure; therefore, the lack of an active 6-glucuronide metabolite makes hydromorphone a useful alternative to morphine in elderly patients with renal failure. However, hydromorphone is similar to morphine in that it is metabolized to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which may be neuroexcitatory. Because of its low plasma protein binding and low probability of interfering with the metabolism of other drugs, hydromorphone may be especially suitable for patients taking multiple medications. OROS (R) hydromorphone is an effective analgesic that is well tolerated and provides more stable plasma concentrations than immediate-release forms of hydromorphone. Its once-daily administration offers an advantage over immediate-release forms and longer-acting formulations that require twice-daily administration. This means OROS (R) hydromorphone will be more convenient for elderly patients and may improve adherence, resulting in improved pain relief and quality of life.

Methods: Clinical data were collected. DNA and RNA were extracted from peripheral blood. A genome-wide microsatellite marker scan was performed and regions with a multipoint location score >= 1.5 were fine mapped. Functional candidate genes identified from databases and by comparing gene expression profiles of genes between affected and unaffected individuals were sequenced. Copy number variation was evaluated with array-based comparative genomic hybridization. Results: The seizure phenotype was benign. Inheritance was consistent with an autosomal dominant model and reduced penetrance. The highest two-point LOD score of 2.8 was identified at marker D17S1606 in a 37 cM interval on chromosome 17q12-q24. Loci on 5q11.2 and on 18p11-q11, showed LOD scores >= 1.5 after fine mapping. Sequencing of nine ion-channel genes and two (RPIP8 and SLC25A39) differentially expressed genes from 17q12-q24, as well as IMPA2 from 18p11-q11 did not reveal a pathogenic alteration. No clinically relevant copy number variation was identified. Conclusions: Our findings suggest complex inheritance of seizure susceptibility in the family with contribution from three loci, including a possible new locus on chromosome 17q. The underlying molecular defects remain unknown. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Automatic Modulation Recognition Using Wavelet Transform and Neural Networks in Wireless Systems	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							SHIFT KEYING SIGNALS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Modulation type is one of the most important characteristics used in signal waveform identification. In this paper, an algorithm for automatic digital modulation recognition is proposed. The proposed algorithm is verified using higher-order statistical moments (HOM) of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as a features set. A multilayer feed-forward neural network trained with resilient backpropagation learning algorithm is proposed as a classifier. The purpose is to discriminate among different M-ary shift keying modulation schemes and the modulation order without any priori signal information. Pre-processing and features subset selection using principal component analysis is used to reduce the network complexity and to improve the classifier's performance. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through confusion matrix and false recognition probability. The proposed classifier is shown to be capable of recognizing the modulation scheme with high accuracy over wide signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and different fading channels.

This initial mutation has high evolvability. The mutation coincidentally allowed representations of the two substances of signs to meet in human brains, thus accounting directly for signs. Recursivity is a result of the self-organization triggered by the choatic system that emerged from this system of signs.

Afferents from the otolith organs and the semicircular canals converge with optokinetic, somatosensory and motor-related signals in the vestibular nuclei, which are reciprocally interconnected with the vestibulocerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. Here, we review the properties of the many cell types in the vestibular nuclei, as well as some fundamental computations implemented within this brainstem-cerebellar circuitry. These include the sensorimotor transformations for reflex generation, the neural computations for inertial motion estimation, the distinction between active and passive head movements, as well as the integration of vestibular and proprioceptive information for body motion estimation. A common theme in the solution to such computational problems is the concept of internal models and their neural implementation. Recent studies have shed new insights into important organizational principles that closely resemble those proposed for other sensorimotor systems, where their neural basis has often been more difficult to identify. As such, the vestibular system provides an excellent model to explore common neural processing strategies relevant both for reflexive and for goal-directed, voluntary movement as well as perception.

Data suggest that low levels of dopamine D2 receptors and attenuated responsivity of dopamine-target regions (e.g. the striatum) to food and food cues are associated with elevated weight. There is mixed evidence that genotypes that appear to be associated with reduced signaling of dopamine circuitry, including DRD2, DRD4 and DAT, are correlated with obesity. In addition, there is emerging fMRI evidence that reduced responsivity in brain regions implicated in food reward increase risk for future weight gain among individuals who appear to be at genetic risk for attenuated dopamine signaling by virtue of DRD2 and DRD4 genotypes. However, it is vital for these relations to be replicated in larger, independent prospective studies and to use positron emission tomography to better characterize parameters of dopamine signaling, including dopamine receptor density, basal dopamine levels, and phasic dopamine release. Improved understanding of the role of dopamine-based reward circuitry and genotypes that influence the functioning of this circuitry may inform the design of more effective preventive and treatment interventions for obesity.

Affective and goal-directed behavioural responses for food have been assessed in response to various physiological, pharmacological and genetic manipulations to provide much insight into the neural mechanisms regulating motivation for food. In addition, several lines of evidence tie the actions of metabolic signals, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters to the modulation of the reward-relevant circuitry including midbrain dopamine neurons and corticolimbic nuclei that encode emotional and cognitive aspects of feeding. Along these lines, this review pulls together research describing the peripheral and central signalling molecules that modulate the rewarding effects of food and the underlying neural pathways.

This musical disorder is termed "congenital amusia," an umbrella term for lifelong musical disabilities that cannot be attributed to deafness, lack of exposure, or brain damage after birth. Amusics seem to lack the ability to detect fine pitch differences in tone sequences. However, differences between statements and questions, which vary in final pitch, are well perceived by most congenital amusic individuals. We hypothesized that the origin of this apparent domain-specificity of the disorder lies in the range of pitch variations, which are very coarse in speech as compared to music. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using a continuum of gradually increasing final pitch in both speech and tone sequences. To this aim, nine amusic cases and nine matched controls were presented with statements and questions that varied on a pitch continuum from falling to rising in 11 steps. The sentences were either naturally spoken or were tone sequence versions of these. The task was to categorize the sentences as statements or questions and the tone sequences as falling or rising. In each case, the observation of an S-shaped identification function indicates that amusics can accurately identify unambiguous examples of statements and questions but have problems with fine variations between these endpoints. Thus, the results indicate that a deficient pitch perception might compromise music, not because it is specialized for that domain but because music requirements are more fine-grained.

Findings from these methodologies are compatible with advance preparation conceptualized as a set of processes activated for both switch and repeat trials, but with substantial variability as a function of individual differences and task requirements. We then highlight new approaches that attempt to capitalize on this variability to link behavior and brain activation patterns. One approach examines correlations among behavioral, ERP and fMRI measures. A second "model-based" approach accounts for differences in preparatory processes by estimating quantitative model parameters that reflect latent psychological processes. We argue that integration of behavioral and neuroscientific methodologies is key to understanding the complex nature of advance preparation in task-switching.

Healthy aging delays scalp EEG sensitivity to noise in a face discrimination task	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						healthy aging; face processing; vision; noise; single-trials; EEG; ERP		We used a single-trial ERP approach to quantify age-related changes in the time-course of noise sensitivity. A total of 62 healthy adults, aged between 19 and 98, performed a non-speeded discrimination task between two faces. Stimulus information was controlled by parametrically manipulating the phase spectrum of these faces. Behavioral 75% correct thresholds increased with age. This result may be explained by lower signal-to-noise ratios in older brains. ERP from each subject were entered into a single-trial general linear regression model to identify variations in neural activity statistically associated with changes in image structure. The fit of the model, indexed by R-2, was computed at multiple post-stimulus time points. The time-course of the R-2 function showed significantly delayed noise sensitivity in older observers. This age effect is reliable, as demonstrated by test-retest in 24 subjects, and started about 120 ms after stimulus onset. Our analyses suggest also a qualitative change from a young to an older pattern of brain activity at around 47 +/- 4 years old.

Sexual dimorphism in the adolescent brain: Role of testosterone and androgen receptor in global and local volumes of grey and white matter	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Adolescence; Puberty; White matter; Grey matter; Volumes; Psychopathology; Depression	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; MRI DATA; PUBERTY; DISORDERS; MATURATION; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; SEGMENTATION; REGISTRATION; ASSOCIATION	Here we examined sex differences in the volumes of grey and white matter, and in grey-matter "density," in a group of typically developing adolescents participating in the Saguenay Youth Study (n=419; 12-18 years). In male adolescents, we also investigated the role of a functional polymorphism in androgen-receptor gene (AR) in moderating the effect of testosterone on volumes of grey and white matter and grey-matter density. Overall, both absolute and relative volumes of white matter were larger in male vs. females adolescents. The relative grey-matter volumes were slightly larger in female than male adolescents and so was the grey-matter density in a large number of cortical regions. In male adolescents, functional polymorphism of AR moderated the effect of testosterone on relative white- and grey-matter volumes. Following a discussion of several methodological and interpretational issues, we outline future directions in investigating brain-behavior relationships vis-A-vis psychopathology.

Crying is a vocal signal through which babies communicate their needs to their parents who should then satisfy them properly. Most of the researches dealing with infant's cry intend mainly to establish a relationship between the acoustic properties of a cry and the state of the baby such as hunger, pain, illness and discomfort. In this work, we are interested in recognizing babies only by analyzing their cries through the use of an automatic analysis and recognition system using a real cry database.

The Evolution of Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channels	INSECT NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTORS	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter							NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; BETA-SUBUNIT DETERMINES; CATION-PI INTERACTION; X-RAY-STRUCTURE; CHLORIDE CHANNEL; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; GABA(A) RECEPTOR; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; BINDING-SITE	Fast, ionotropic neurotransmission mediated by ligand-gated ion channels is essential for timely behavioral responses in multicellular organisms. Metazoa employ more ionotropic neurotransmitters in more types of synapses, inhibitory or excitatory, than is generally appreciated. It is becoming increasingly clear that the adaptability of a single neurotransmitter receptor superfamily, the pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs), makes the diversity in ionotropic neurotransmission possible. Modification of a common pLGIC structure generates channels that are gated by ligands as different as protons, histamine or zinc and that pair common neurotransmitters with both cation and anion permeability. A phylogeny of the pLGIC gene family from representative metazoa suggests that pLGIC diversity is ancient and evolution of contemporary phyla was characterized by a surprising loss of pLGIC diversity. The pLGIC superfamily reveals aspects of early metazoan evolution, may help us identify novel neurotransmitters and can inform our exploration of structure/function relationships.

The nervous system via peripheral nervous system (PNS) or sympathetic nervous system (SNS) along with hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) regulates the innate immune response Thus the nervous system may play an important role in fine tuning and precise regulation of exaggerated innate immune response via different pathways (ie cholinergic pathway activated by vagus nerve stimulation. alpha or beta-adrenergic receptor activation etc.) in sepsis Hence neuroimmunomodulation can be a future approach to treat sepsis.

Five sets of signals from flight flutter tests corresponding to the excited inputs (differential ailerons, collective ailerons, collective stabilizers, differential stabilizers, and rudders) were measured at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. Two types of signals were used to build this new model: control deflections (the inputs) and structural deflections (the outputs). The fuzzy logic method was used in identifying the nonlinear aircraft models for 16 flight-test cases, based on Mach numbers (between 0.85 and 1,30) and altitudes (between 5000 and 25,000 ft). To find the best model, we tested a variety of systems with different numbers of inputs or fuzzy logic methods. By comparing the results obtained, we conclude that the best results, in terms of our preestablished specifications, were obtained for the 12-input Sugeno system.

We explored the effect of the epsilon 4 allele on regional cortical thickness and volume measurements using an automated pipeline in 111 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 115 AD patients, and 107 age-matched healthy controls. The clinical data were used as covariates in the thickness and volume comparisons. The epsilon 4 carriers had significantly smaller volume than non-carriers in caudate (p = 0.028) in controls; in amygdala and caudate in the MCI group (p <= 0.049); and in hippocampus and amygdala in the AD group (p <= 0.001). In the female subjects, the epsilon 4 carriers had significantly thinner cortical thickness or smaller volume than non-carriers in medial orbitofrontal gyrus and caudate in controls (p <= 0.014); in amygdala in MCI subjects (p = 0.047) and in hippocampus and amygdala in AD patients (p <= 0.024). However, in the male subjects, there were significant differences in cortical thickness and volume between epsilon 4 carriers and non-carriers in several structures in the MCI group, but no differences in the controls and AD patients. Compared to the non-carriers, the homozygous epsilon 4 carriers showed significant volume loss in hippocampus, deep nuclei, and caudal anterior cingulate cortex in MCI. In the AD group, the homozygous epsilon 4 carriers had significant volume loss in hippocampus and amygdala. We conclude that the APOE epsilon 4 allele modulates regional cortical thickness and volume in relation to diagnostic group and gender. The epsilon 4 allele has a dose-dependent and regionally specific effect on brain structures.

Automated CTH analysis was applied to baseline high-resolution structural MR images of 145 subjects with a maximum follow-up time of 7.4 years pooled from population-based study databases held in the University of Kuopio. Statistical differences in CTH between study groups and significant correlations between CTH and clinical and demographic factors were assessed and displayed on a cortical surface model. Compared to HC group (n = 26), the AD (n = 21) group displayed significantly reduced CTH in several areas of frontal and temporal cortices of the right hemisphere. Higher education and lower MMSE scores were correlated with reduced CTH in the AD group, whereas no significant correlation was found between CDR-SB scores or APOE genotype and CTH. The P-MCI group demonstrated significantly reduced CTH compared to S-MCI in frontal, temporal and parietal cortices even after statistically adjusting for all confounding variables. Ultimately, analysis of CTH can be used to detect cortical thinning in subjects with progressive MCI several years before conversion and clinical diagnosis of AD dementia, irrespective of their cognitive performance, education level, or APOE genotype.

After a decade in which a number of transgenic (Tg) mouse models mimicking AD-like amyloid-deposition pathology have been successfully generated, few rat models have been reported that develop intracellular and extracellular A beta accumulation, together with impairment of cognition. The generation of a Tg rat reproducing the full AD-like amyloid pathology has been elusive. Here we describe the generation and characterization of a new transgenic rat line, coded McGill-R-Thy1-APP, developed to express the human amyloid-beta precursor protein (A beta PP) carrying both the Swedish and Indiana mutations under the control of the murine Thy1.2 promoter. The selected mono-transgenic line displays an extended phase of intraneuronal A beta accumulation, already apparent at 1 week after birth, which is widespread throughout different cortical areas and the hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus). Homozygous Tg animals eventually produce extracellular A beta deposits and, by 6 months of age, dense, thioflavine S-positive, amyloid plaques are detected, associated with glial activation and surrounding dystrophic neurites. The cognitive functions in transgenic McGill-RThy1-APP rats, as assessed using the Morris water maze task, were found already altered as early as at 3 months of age, when no CNS plaques are yet present. The spatial cognitive impairment becomes more prominent in older animals (13 months), where the behavioral performance of Tg rats positively correlates with the levels of soluble A beta (trimers) measured in the cortex.

Facilitatory conditioning of the supplementary motor area in humans enhances the corticophrenic responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation. J Appl Physiol 108: 39-46, 2010. First published November 5, 2009; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.91454.2008.-Inspiratory loading in awake humans is associated with electroencephalographic signs of supplementary motor area (SMA) activation. To provide evidence for a functional connection between SMA and the diaphragm representation in the primary motor cortex (M1(DIA)), we tested the hypothesis that modulating SMA activity using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) would alter M1DIA excitability. Amplitude and latency of diaphragm motor evoked potentials (MEP(DIA)), evoked through single pulse M1DIA stimulation, before and up to 16 min after SMA stimulation, were taken as indicators of M1DIA excitability. MEPs from the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI, MEP(FDI)) served as a control. Four SMA conditioning sessions were performed in random order at 1-wk intervals. Two aimed at increasing SMA activity (5 and 10 Hz, both at 110% of FDI active motor threshold; referred to as 5Hz and 10Hz, respectively), and two aimed at decreasing it (1 Hz either at 110% of FDI active or resting motor threshold, referred to as aMT or rMT, respectively). The 5Hz protocol increased MEPDIA and MEPFDI amplitudes with a maximum 11-16 min post-stimulation (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively). The 10Hz protocol increased MEPFDI amplitude with a similar time course (P = 0.03) but did not increase MEPDIA amplitude (P = 0.32). Both aMT and rMT failed to decrease MEPDIA or MEPFDI amplitudes (P = 0.23 and P = 0.90, respectively, for diaphragm and P = 0.48 and P = 0.14 for FDI). MEPDIA and MEPFDI latencies were unaffected by rTMS. These results demonstrate that 5-Hz rTMS over the SMA can increase the excitability of M1DIA. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis of a functional connection between SMA and M1DIA.

Regulation of Phagocytosis in Macrophages by Neuraminidase 1	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							BETA-GALACTOSIDASE; LYSOSOMAL SIALIDASE; T-LYMPHOCYTES; CELL-SURFACE; ANTIGEN PRESENTATION; BINDING-PROTEIN; B-CELLS; EXPRESSION; COMPLEX; ACID	The differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and dendritic cells is accompanied by induction of cell-surface neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) and cathepsin A (CathA), the latter forming a complex with and activating Neu1. To clarify the biological importance of this phenomenon we have developed the gene-targeted mouse models of a CathA deficiency (CathA(S190A)) and a double CathA/Neu1 deficiency (CathA(S190A-Neo)). Macrophages of CathA(S190A-Neo) mice and their immature dendritic cells showed a significantly reduced capacity to engulf Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and positively and negatively charged polymer beads as well as IgG-opsonized beads and erythrocytes. Properties of the cells derived from CathA(S190A) mice were indistinguishable from those of wild-type controls, suggesting that the absence of Neu1, which results in the increased sialylation of the cell surface proteins, probably affects multiple receptors for phagocytosis. Indeed, treatment of the cells with purified mouse Neu1 reduced surface sialylation and restored phagocytosis. Because Neu1-deficient cells showed reduced internalization of IgG-opsonized sheep erythrocytes whereas binding of the erythrocytes to the cells at 4 degrees C persisted, we speculate that the absence of Neu1 in particular affected transduction of signals from the Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G(Fc gamma R). Indeed the macrophages from the Neu1-deficient mice showed increased sialylation and impaired phosphorylation of Fc gamma R as well as markedly reduced phosphorylation of Syk kinase in response to treatment with IgG-opsonized beads. Altogether our data suggest that the cell surface Neu1 activates the phagocytosis in macrophages and dendritic cells through desialylation of surface receptors, thus, contributing to their functional integrity.

Status epilepticus, developmental disabilities, and the presence of coexisting other seizures/types were also significantly different, with a higher predominance in group 2 children. Patients with status epilepticus, coexistent seizure types, and developmental disabilities should be identified and more carefully followed, with a lower threshold for starting these children on a combination of antiepileptic drugs adhered to.

We describe a patient diagnosed with methylmalonic aciduria at 4.5 months of age during an episode of metabolic decompensation. The child was developmentally delayed and hypotonic; his electroencephalography (EEC) showed hypsarrythmia and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated moderate abnormalities in the globi pallidi. Following the failure of vigabatrin and lamotrigine to control the spasms, hydrocortisone was introduced. Methylmalonic acid excretion increased at the onset of steroid therapy but was rapidly corrected with transient protein restriction and initiation of metronidazole therapy. Full control of spasms and hypsarrythmia permitted the discontinuation of hydrocortisone therapy a year following its initiation. Tone and development improved although the latter remained delayed. This case illustrates the importance of screening for inborn errors of metabolism in seizure disorders, and that, although challenging, the management of methylmalonic aciduria with concurrent steroid therapy is possible and beneficial.

Present Conceptualization of Early Childhood Neurodevelopmental Disabilities	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						neurodevelopment disabilities; development; cerebral palsy; mental retardation; autism	DEVELOPMENTAL LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION; CEREBRAL-PALSY; MENTAL-RETARDATION; INTELLECTUAL-DISABILITY; KINDERGARTEN-CHILDREN; ETIOLOGIC YIELD; DELAY; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	Neurodevelopmental disabilities are collectively a common problem in child health that frequently prompts neurologic assessment and intervention. They are a group of heterogeneous conditions that share a disturbance in the acquisition of basic developmental skills in a chronologically appropriate manner. Lacking uniform diagnostic means of ascertainment, their recognition depends on fulfilling present consensus opinion regarding the various subtypes now recognized. Distinctive subtypes of neurodevelopmental disabilities can be accurately diagnosed according to present consensus conceptualization. Dual diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disabilities in the same child is possible, given present opinion. It can be expected that these conceptualizatons will be dynamic and guide ongoing research efforts that will elucidate basic mechanisms, effective therapeutic interventions, and evaluate outcomes.

Dynamic emotion processing in Parkinson's disease as a function of channel availability	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Visual; Auditory; Emotion; Parkinson's disease; Basal ganglia; Audiovisual speech	FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; BASAL GANGLIA; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; WORKING-MEMORY; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; BRAIN; PROSODY; FACE	Parkinson's disease (PD) is linked to impairments for recognizing emotional expressions, although the extent and nature of these communication deficits are uncertain. Here, we compared how adults with and without PD recognize dynamic expressions of emotion in three channels, involving lexical-semantic, prosody, and/or facial cues (each channel was investigated individually and in combination). Results indicated that while emotion recognition increased with channel availability in the PD group, patients performed significantly worse than healthy participants in all conditions. Difficulties processing dynamic emotional stimuli in PD could be linked to striatal dysfunction, which reduces efficient binding of sequential information in the disease.

Participants included 494 tenth-grade students (M=15.25 years, SD=0.47) recruited from two secondary schools in Beijing, China. Participants completed self-report measures assessing rumination and neuroticism as well as a semistructured clinical interview assessing current and past clinically significant depressive episodes. Higher levels of rumination were associated with a greater likelihood of exhibiting both a current depressive episode and a past history of depressive episodes even after controlling for neuroticism. Higher levels of rumination were also associated with greater severity and duration of current depressive episodes and greater severity of past depressive episodes even after controlling for neuroticism. Contrary to the sex differences hypothesis of the response styles theory, girls and boys did not differ in levels of rumination.	[Abela, John R.

Their expression is affected by cardiac region, hemodynamic properties, heart-rate changes, neurohormones and cardiac disease. One of the important determinants of ion-channel function is the level of ion-channel subunit mRNA expression, which governs the production of ion-channel proteins that traffic to the cell-membrane to form functional ion-channels. Ion-channel mRNA-expression profiling can be performed with cDNA microarrays or high-throughput reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Expression profiling has been applied to evaluate the dependence of ion-channel expression on cardiac region, revealing the molecular basis of regionally-controlled electrical properties as well as the molecular determinants of specialized electrical functions like pacemaking activity. Ion-channel remodeling occurs with cardiac diseases like heart failure, congenital repolarization abnormalities, and atrial fibrillation, and expression profiling has provided insights into the mechanisms by which these conditions affect cardiac electrical stability. Expression profiling has also shown how hormonal changes, antiarrhythmic drugs, cardiac development and altered heart rate affect ion-channel expression patterns to modify cardiac electrical function and sometimes to produce cardiac rhythm disturbances. This article reviews the information obtained to date with the application of cardiac ion-channel expression profiling. With increasing availability and efficiency of high-throughput PCR methods for ion-channel subunit mRNA-expression characterization, it is likely that the application of ion-channel expression profiling will increase and that it will provide important new insights into the determinants of cardiac electrical function in both physiological and pathological situations.

A Link with NGF Maturation and Degradation	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Symposium on Cholinergic Mechanisms	2008	Foz do Iguacu, BRAZIL			NGF; Alzheimer's disease; Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons; Plasmin; MMP-9	NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; TRANSGENIC MICE; BASAL FOREBRAIN; SENILE DEMENTIA; NEURONS; RELEASE; BOUTONS; RAT	Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are highly dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) supply for the maintenance of their cholinergic phenotype as well as their cholinergic synaptic integrity. The precursor form of NGF, proNGF, abounds in the CNS and is highly elevated in Alzheimer's disease. In order to obtain a deeper understanding of the NGF biology in the CNS, we have performed a series of ex vivo and in vivo investigations to elucidate the mechanisms of release, maturation and degradation of this neurotrophin. In this short review, we describe this NGF metabolic pathway, its significance for the maintenance of basal cholinergic neurons, and its dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease. We are proposing that the conversion of proNGF to mature NGF occurs in the extracellular space by the coordinated action of zymogens, convertases, and endogenous regulators, which are released in the extracellular space in an activity-dependent fashion. We further discuss our findings of a diminished conversion of the NGF precursor molecule to its mature form in Alzheimer's disease as well as an augmented degradation of mature NGF. These combined effects on NGF metabolism would explain the well-known cholinergic atrophy found in Alzheimer's disease and would offer new therapeutic opportunities aimed at correcting the NGF dysmetabolism along with A beta-induced inflammatory responses.

Given the relative dearth of understanding of causative mechanisms behind the invasiveness of medulloblastomas, and a general lack of validated in vitro models with which to study them, our objectives were (1) to obtain quantitative data on the invasiveness of five distinct medulloblastoma cell lines within a 3-dimensional in vitro collagen-based model; and (2) to characterize some of the mechanisms behind invasion, specifically striving to identify proteolytic processes that occur as medulloblastoma cells disrupt and thereby invade the normal tissue surrounding them, and specific inhibitors of these proteolytic enzymes. Five different medulloblastoma cell lines (UW228-1, 2 and 3; Daoy, and Madsen) were implanted onto a 3-dimensional, type I collagen gel assay to assess tumour invasion distance and mean doubling time over 5 days. Proteolytic activity was assessed against collagen types I and IV by measuring the degradation of 3H-collagen I and IV to products soluble in 100% w/v trichloroacetic acid; and general (neutral) proteolytic activity evaluated by measuring the degradation of 3H-albumin. In other experiments, cells were pre-exposed to a variety of protease inhibitors, including inhibitors of metalloproteinases and cysteine, serine and aspartic proteases, and then plated to identify any inhibition of invasion. Inter-group differences in mean invasion distance were assessed by means of Student's t-tests for non-paired subjects, with P < 0.05 set as the threshold for statistical significance. For the inhibitor studies, an inhibition index, called the inhibitory concentration 50, IC-50, was calculated by performing a regression analysis for each inhibitor tested over a range of concentrations, for each cell line. Within hours of implantation, individual cells readily detached from the surface of the cell aggregates and invaded the collagen matrix, to distances of up to 1,200 mu m and at rates of up to 300-mu m per day; the UW228-1 cell line clearly was less invasive than the other four cell lines. Proteolytic activity was identified against collagen type I, but not against collagen type IV or albumin; but there was no apparent correlation between invasion distance and either cell doubling time or the amount of collagen type I proteolytic activity. Both metalloproteinase inhibitors suppressed tumour invasion, as did one of two cysteine protease inhibitors; but there was no tumour suppression with either serine or aspartic protease inhibition. MMP-1 and 2, and TIMP-1 and 2 all were detectable by Western blot analysis. Medulloblastoma cell invasiveness within the 3-dimensional model used here appears to depend upon a combination of metalloproteinase and cysteine protease activity, a finding that may suggest areas for potential future clinical investigation and therapy.

Cortical Thinning in Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment and Vascular Dementia of Subcortical Type	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Small-vessel disease; dementia; mild cognitive impairment; cortical thinning	WHITE-MATTER LESIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; CHOLINERGIC PATHWAYS; THICKNESS; BRAIN; ATROPHY; MRI; QUANTIFICATION; ABNORMALITIES	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is known to be a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similarly, MCI associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI), might be a forme froste of subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). Patterns of cortical thinning in addition to the ischemia rating on MRI may further elucidate the clinical characteristics and pathogenesis of SVaD and svMCI. We tried to determine if svMCI differs from SVaD in the distribution of cortical atrophy, which may help understand the hierarchy between svMCI and SVaD and possibly also how svMCI evolves into SVaD. METHODS Twenty patients with SVaD, 34 patients with svMCI, 115 patients with AD, and 96 individuals with normal-cognition (NC) were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including 3-dimensional volumetric images for cortical thickness analysis across the entire brain. RESULTS Compared to NC, svMCI patients showed cortical thinning in inferior frontal and orbitofrontal gyri, anterior cingulate, insula, superior temporal gyrus, and lingual gyrus, while cortical thinning in SVaD patients involved all these areas plus dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortices. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest the presence of hierarchy between svMCI and SVaD, and that the cognitive decline from svMCI to SVaD is associated with lesions in dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortices.

Behavioral time course of microstimulation in cortical area MT. J Neurophysiol 103: 334-345, 2010. First published October 28, 2009; doi: 10.1152/jn.91022.2008. Electrical stimulation of the brain is a valuable research tool and has shown therapeutic promise in the development of new sensory neural prosthetics. Despite its widespread use, we still do not fully understand how current passed through a microelectrode interacts with functioning neural circuits. Past behavioral studies have suggested that weak electrical stimulation (referred to as microstimulation) of sensory areas of cortex produces percepts that are similar to those generated by normal sensory stimuli. In contrast, electrophysiological studies using in vitro or anesthetized preparations have shown that neural activity produced by brief microstimulation is radically different and longer lasting than normal responses. To help reconcile these two aspects of microstimulation, we examined the temporal properties that microstimulation has on visual perception. We found that brief application of subthreshold microstimulation in the middle temporal (MT) area of visual cortex produced smaller and longer-lasting effects on motion perception compared with an equivalent visual stimulus. In agreement with past electrophysiological studies, a computer simulation reproduced our behavioral effects when the time course of a single microstimulation pulse was modeled with three components: an immediate fast strong excitatory component, followed by a weaker inhibitory component, and then followed by a long duration weak excitatory component. Overall, these results suggest the behavioral effects of microstimulation in our experiments were caused by the unique and long-lasting temporal effects microstimulation has on functioning cortical circuits.

Despite negative neuroimaging findings, many athletes display neurophysiological alterations and post-concussion symptoms such as headaches and sensitivity to light and noise. It is suspected that neurometabolic changes may underlie these changes. In this study we investigated the effects of sports concussion on brain metabolism using (1)H-MR spectroscopy by comparing a group of 12 non-concussed athletes with a group of 12 concussed athletes of the same age (mean 22.5 years) and education (mean 16 years). All athletes were scanned 1-6 days post-concussion in a 3T Siemens MRI, and were administered a symptom scale to evaluate post-concussion symptomatology. Participants also completed a neuropsychological test battery to assess verbal memory, visual memory, information processing speed, and reaction time, and no group differences were detected relative to controls. Concussed athletes showed a higher number of symptoms than non-concussed athletes, and they also showed a significant decrease in glutamate in the primary motor cortex (M1), as well as significant decreases in N-acetylaspartate in the prefrontal and primary motor cortices. No changes were observed in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the metabolic changes in M1 correlated with self-reported symptom severity despite equivalent neuropsychological performance. These results confirm cortical neurometabolic changes in the acute post-concussion phase, and demonstrate for the first time a correlation between subjective self-reported symptoms and objective physical changes that may be related to increased vulnerability of the concussed brain.

Study design Review of medical files of newborns >22 weeks gestation who died in the delivery room (DR) or the NICU during 12 months in 4 NICUs (Chicago, Milwaukee, Montreal, and Groningen). We categorized deaths using a 2-by-2 matrix and determined whether mechanical ventilation was withdrawn/withheld and whether the child was dying despite ventilation or physiologically stable but extubated for neurological prognosis. Results Most unstable patients in all units died in their parents' arms after mechanical ventilation was withdrawn. In Milwaukee, Montreal, and Groningen, 4% to 12% of patients died while receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This proportion was higher in Chicago (31%). Elective extubation for quality-of-life reasons never occurred in Chicago and occurred in 19% to 35% of deaths in the other units. The proportion of DR deaths in Milwaukee, Montreal, and Groningen was 16% to 22%. No DR deaths occurred in Chicago. Conclusions Death in the NICU occurred differently within and between countries. Distinctive end-of-life decisions can be categorized separately by using a model with uniform definitions of withholding/withdrawing mechanical ventilation correlated with the patient's physiological condition. Cross-cultural comparison of end-of-life practice is feasible and important when comparing NICU outcomes. (J Pediatr 2010; 156: 33-7).	[Verhagen, A. A.

The proposal that some amino acids could mediate synaptic transmission in the CNS initially met with much resistance. Both GABA and its parent glutamate are abundant in the brain; but, unlike glutamate, GABA had no obvious metabolic function. By the late 1950s, the switch of interest from electrical to chemical transmission invigorated the search for central transmitters. Its identification with Factor I, a brain extract that inhibited crustacean muscle, focused interest on GABA as a possible inhibitory transmitter. In the first microiontophoretic tests, though GABA strongly inhibited spinal neurons, these effects were considered 'non-specific'. Strong excitation by glutamate (and other acidic amino acids) led to the same conclusion. However, their great potency and rapid actions on cortical neurons convinced other authors that these endogenous amino acids are probably synaptic transmitters. This was partly confirmed by showing that both IPSPs and GABA greatly increased Cl- conductance, their effects having similar reversal potentials. Many anticonvulsants proving to be GABA antagonists, by the 1970s GABA became widely accepted as a mediator of IPSPs. Progress was much slower for glutamate. Being generated on distant dendrites, EPSPs could not be easily compared with glutamate-induced excitation, and the search for specific antagonists was long hampered by the lack of blockers and the variety of glutamate receptors. These difficulties were gradually overcome by the application of powerful techniques, such as single channel recording, cloning receptors, as well as new pharmacological tools.

Although numerous in number, neurotransmitter substances have always been thought to drive the receptor complex into the open state in much the same way and not rely substantially on other factors. However, recent work on kainate-type (KAR) ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) has identified an exception to this rule. Here, the activation process fails to occur unless external monovalent anions and cations are present. This absolute requirement of ions singles out KARs from all other ligand-gated ion channels, including closely related AMPA- and NMDA-type iGluR family members. The uniqueness of ion-dependent gating has earmarked this feature of KARs as a putative target for the development of selective ligands; a prospect all the more compelling with the recent elucidation of distinct anion and cation binding pockets. Despite these advances, much remains to be resolved. For example, it is still not clear how ion effects on KARs impacts glutamatergic transmission. I conclude by speculating that further analysis of ion-dependent gating may provide clues into how functionally diverse iGluRs families emerged by evolution. Consequently, ion-dependent gating of KARs looks set to continue to be a subject of topical inquiry well into the future.

In the mature cortex and hippocampus, dendritic spines are heterogeneous in shape. It has been shown that the shapes of the spine can affect synapse stability and synaptic function. Dendritic spines are highly motile structures that can undergo actin-dependent shape changes, which occur over a time scale ranging from seconds to tens of minutes or even days. The formation, remodelling and elimination of excitatory synapses on dendritic spines represent ways of refining the microcircuitry in the brain. Here I review the current knowledge on the effects of modulation of AMPA and NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors on dendritic spine formation, motility and remodelling.

To better understand this relationship, we assessed pitch-matching abilities in congenital amusics, who have documented disabilities in pitch perception, and in matched controls under normal, masked, and guided feedback conditions. Their vocal productions were analyzed for fundamental frequency and showed that amusics were significantly less accurate at pitch matching than the controls. However, five of the six amusics showed a significant correlation between their produced pitches and the target pitch. Feedback condition had no effect on pitch-matching accuracy. These results show impaired vocal pitch-matching abilities in amusics but also show a relationship between perceived and produced pitches. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America.

However, few studies have looked at flow speech patterns in PD contribute to linguistic and social impressions formed about PD patients from the perspective of listeners. In this Study, discourse recordings elicited from nondemented PD speakers (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 17) were presented to 30 listeners Unaware of the speakers' disease Status. In separate conditions. listeners rated the discourse samples based oil their impressions of the speaker or of the linguistic content. Acoustic measures of the speech samples were analyzed for comparison with listeners perceptual ratings. Results showed that although listeners rated the content of Parkinsonian discourse as linguistically appropriate (e.g., coherent, well-organized, easy to follow), the PD speakers were perceived as significantly less interested, less involved, less happy, and less friendly than healthy speakers. Negative social impressions demonstrated a relationship to changes in vocal intensity (loudness) and temporal characteristics (dysfluencies) of Parkinsonian speech. Our findings emphasize important psychosocial ramifications of PD that are likely to limit opportunities for communication and social interaction for those affected, because of the negative impressions drawn by listeners based oil their speaking voice.

Considering the different affinities of D(2) dopamine receptors for typical and atypical NLPs. these drugs may differentially affect the functions of the striatum, a determinant brain structure involved in procedural learning. The influence of risperidone (2-6 mg) and haloperidol (2-40 mg) oil a nonmotor procedural task involving semantically related pairs of words with inverted letters was investigated in this double-blind study. The performance of 26 patients with SZ, randomly assigned to risperidone or haloperidol, was compared to that of 18 healthy controls at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Results revealed that all patients with SZ exhibited slower reading speed of the word pairs than healthy controls at all assessment periods. In addition. procedural learning - characterized as a significant decrease in the time taken to read aloud the target word pairs - was more impaired in the haloperidol- than in the risperidone-treated group at all assessment periods. Healthy controls showed steady improvement in reading speed over the 12 months of the study, in contrast to SZ patients, who reached a plateau in their capacity to improve mirror-reading skill over time. However, all SZ participants in the study showed near normal learning profiles from exposure to semantic associations embedded in the procedural memory task, providing evidence for the preservation of associative connections in the semantic network of these patients. The observed impairment in procedural learning in SZ may thus reflect, at least in part, the influence Of neuroleptic medication on Striatal functions. (JINS, 2010, 16, 148-156.)

Radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the endothelium may prevent recanalization after coil embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors performed in vitro experiments in chicken meat and egg white models to investigate the thermal distribution and geometry of lesions created with RF applied through standard coils alone or by using a prototype RF electrode inserted in a coil or a mass of coils. A mathematic model was designed to predict perianeurysmal isotherm lesions by using the bio-heat equation. In an in vivo coil arterial occlusion model (six dogs), the authors compared angiographic and pathologic results of coil embolization (n = 8) with those of coil embolization preceded by RF ablation (n = 7) by using a cardiac electrode at 1 month. RESULTS: Current coils offer high impedance (400 Omega) at high current frequencies and are damaged by RF transmission. A dedicated electrode generated reproducible lesions, but contact with coils interferes with lesion reproducibility. When the coil mass was used, a uniform RF lesion that conformed to the coil mass shape was produced. The mathematic model predicted a uniform heat distribution within 1 mm from the coil mass periphery. Arterial coil embolization led to occlusion followed by recanalization (n = 8), whereas RF ablation (20-30 W for 60 seconds) prevented recanalization in all coil-occluded arteries (P < .001, chi(2) test). Pathologic findings helped confirm complete arterial occlusion with RF ablation. One animal developed brachial plexus injury with excessive levels of RF ablation. CONCLUSIONS: RF ablation can prevent recanalization after coil occlusion at least in the arterial model. Modifications of coils, dedicated neurovascular electrodes, and technique optimization remain necessary before considering a clinical application.

J	Gheorghiu, E; Kingdom, F; Varshney, R				Gheorghiu, Elena; Kingdom, Frederick; Varshney, Rickul			Curvature coding is tuned for motion direction	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						motion; temporal-frequency; shape; curvature; adaptation; after-effect	INFERIOR TEMPORAL NEURONS; RADIAL FREQUENCY PATTERNS; VISUAL AREA MT; SHAPE-FREQUENCY; MACAQUE MONKEY; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; CARTESIAN GRATINGS; MOVING CONTOURS; OBJECT VISION; V4	We have investigated the global and local motion tuning properties of curvature coding mechanisms using two shape aftereffects believed to be mediated by curvature-sensitive mechanisms: the shape-frequency after-effect, or SFAE, and the shape-amplitude after-effect, or SAAE. The SFAE and SAAE are the phenomena in which adaptation to a sine-wave-shaped contour causes a shift in respectively the apparent shape-frequency and apparent shape-amplitude of a test contour in a direction away from that of the adapting stimulus. In the global motion condition the sinusoidal-shaped contours were made to drift within a fixed stimulus window in the direction of their axis of modulation. In the local motion condition the contour was constructed from a string of Gabors, and their carriers but not envelopes moved. We investigated selectivity to motion direction by using adaptor and test contours that moved either in the same or opposite directions. We found that in the global motion condition both the SFAE and SAAE showed selectivity to motion direction, and that for the same-motion-direction condition, both after-effects increased with shape temporal frequency. We then examined the effect of luminance spatial frequency and luminance temporal frequency on global motion direction selectivity. Luminance temporal frequency accounted for some of the increase in after-effect magnitude with shape temporal frequency, but shape temporal frequency also contributed. The local motion after-effects on the other hand were neither selective to motion direction nor increased with luminance temporal frequency. Taken together, the results are best understood by supposing that curvature is encoded by mechanisms that are selective to motion direction and that the directional selectivity best manifests itself psychophysically when there is sufficient spatio-temporal coverage of the stimulus to stimulate the full array of potentially responsive curvature-coding mechanisms.

Here, we address this issue by assessing the contrast sensitivity response properties of the early visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) to sine-wave gratings of low, medium and high spatial frequencies in adults with ASD and in an age- and IQ-matched control group. Our results show that while VEP contrast responses to low and high spatial frequency gratings did not differ between ASD and controls, early VEPs to mid spatial frequency gratings exhibited similar response characteristics as those to high spatial frequency gratings in ASD. Our findings show evidence for an altered functional segregation of early visual channels, especially those responsible for processing mid- and high-frequency spatial scales.

Similar perceptual costs for dividing attention between retina- and space-centered targets in humans	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						attention; reference frame; smooth pursuit eye movements; orientation discrimination; retinal velocity	PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; PARIETAL CORTEX NEURONS; VISUAL-ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MOTION; TRACKING; FRAMES; LOCATIONS; OBJECTS; SHIFTS	Visual-spatial attention enhances the perception of behaviorally relevant stimuli. One issue that remains unclear is whether attention is preferentially allocated to stimuli that remain fixed in one reference frame (e. g., retina-centered), or whether it could be equally allocated to stimuli fixed in other frames. We investigated this issue by asking observers to covertly attend to sinusoidal gratings fixed in different reference frames and to discriminate changes in their orientation. First, we quantified orientation discrimination thresholds (ODTs) while subjects pursued a moving dot and either attended to a retina-or a space-centered grating. We then measured ODTs while subjects divided attention between the two gratings. We found that dividing attention proportionally increased ODTs for both target gratings relative to the focused attention condition. Second, we used the same stimulus configuration and conditions during a fixation task. Here, one grating was retina-and space-centered while the other moved in space and on the retina. Again, ODTs during divided attention proportionally increased for both gratings. These increases were similar to those measured during smooth pursuit. Our results show that humans can proportionally divide attention between targets centered in different reference frames during both smooth pursuit eye movements and fixations.

A biologically plausible model of human shape symmetry perception	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						global shape; curvature; symmetry; object recognition; neural model	DETECTING MIRROR SYMMETRY; BILATERAL SYMMETRY; CONTOUR CURVATURE; ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY; OBJECT PERCEPTION; SPATIAL FILTERS; TEMPORAL CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; DOT PATTERNS	Symmetry is usually computationally expensive to encode reliably, and yet it is relatively effortless to perceive. Here, we extend F. J. A. M. Poirier and H. R. Wilson's (2006) model for shape perception to account for H. R. Wilson and F. Wilkinson's (2002) data on shape symmetry. Because the model already accounts for shape perception, only minimal neural circuitry is required to enable it to encode shape symmetry as well. The model is composed of three main parts: (1) recovery of object position using large-scale non-Fourier V4-like concentric units that respond at the center of concentric contour segments across orientations, (2) around that recovered object center, curvature mechanisms combine multiplicatively the responses of oriented filters to encode object-centric local shape information, with a preference for convexities, and (3) object-centric symmetry mechanisms. Model and human performances are comparable for symmetry perception of shapes. Moreover, with some improvement of edge recovery, the model can encode symmetry axes in natural images such as faces.

However, the culture of organized tissue, such as brain slices, has been more difficult to adapt to microfluidic devices. Here, we present a microfluidic system, comprising(i) a perfusion chamber for the culture of organotypic slices that is compatible with high resolution imaging on inverted microscopes, and (ii) a novel transparent microfluidic probe (MFP) for the localized microperfusion of the brain tissue. The MFP is made in poly(dimethylsiloxane), features six micrometre-scale apertures and can be assembled within a few hours in a standard laboratory. Each aperture can indiscriminately be used either for the injection or aspiration of solutions, giving rise to many possible combinations. TheMFP was successfully used for the perfusion of a small number of cells in a brain slice with concurrent confocal fluorescence imaging of the perfused dye and sub-cellular structures within the tissue.

Object recognition memory and the rodent hippocampus	LEARNING & MEMORY			English	Article							RETROGRADE-AMNESIA; SPATIAL MEMORY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; LESIONS; RATS; DAMAGE; CORTEX; CONSOLIDATION; PERFORMANCE; RETENTION	In rodents, the novel object recognition task (NOR) has become a benchmark task for assessing recognition memory. Yet, despite its widespread use, a consensus has not developed about which brain structures are important for task performance. We assessed both the anterograde and retrograde effects of hippocampal lesions on performance in the NOR task. Rats received 12 5-min exposures to two identical objects and then received either bilateral lesions of the hippocampus or sham surgery 1 d, 4 wk, or 8 wk after the final exposure. On a retention test 2 wk after surgery, the 1-d and 4-wk hippocampal lesion groups exhibited impaired object recognition memory. In contrast, the 8-wk hippocampal lesion group performed similarly to controls, and both groups exhibited a preference for the novel object. These same rats were then given four postoperative tests using unique object pairs and a 3-h delay between the exposure phase and the test phase. Hippocampal lesions produced moderate and reliable memory impairment. The results suggest that the hippocampus is important for object recognition memory.

Parametric segmentation approaches typically assume unimodal Gaussian distributions on MRI intensities of individual tissue classes, even in applications on multi-spectral images. However, this assumption has not been rigorously verified especially in the context of MS. In this work, we evaluate the local MRI intensities of both healthy and diseased brain tissues of 21 multi-spectral MRIs (63 volumes in total) of MS patients for adherence to this assumption. We show that the tissue intensities are not uniform across the brain and vary across (anatomical) regions of the brain. Consequently, we show that Gaussian mixtures can better model the multi-spectral intensities. We utilize an Expectation Maximization (EM) based approach to learn the models along with a symmetric Jeffreys divergence criterion to study differences in intensity distributions. The effects of these findings are also empirically verified on automatic segmentation of brains with MS.	[Xiao, Yiming; Francis, Simon; Arnold, Douglas L.; Collins, D.

Here we use a combination of theoretical and numerical approaches to study the effects of delayed global feedback on the information transmission properties of neural networks. Specifically, we compare networks of neurons that display intrinsic interspike interval correlations (nonrenewal) to networks that do not (renewal). We find that excitatory and inhibitory delays can tune information transmission by single neurons but not by the entire network. Most surprisingly, addition of a delay can change the dependence of the information on the coupling strength for renewal neurons and not for nonrenewal neurons. Our results show that intrinsic ISI correlations can have nontrivial interactions with network-induced phenomena.	[Akerberg, O. Avila; Chacron, M.

Many approaches have been proposed to model the diffusion signal and to obtain estimates of fibre tracts. Despite these advances, the question of defining probabilistic connectivity indices which utilize the relevant information in the diffusion MRI signal to indicate connectivity strength, remains largely open. To address this problem we introduce a novel numerical implementation of a stochastic completion field algorithm, which models the diffusion of water molecules in a medium while incorporating the local diffusion MRI data. We show that the approach yields a valid probabilistic estimate of connectivity strength between two seed regions, with experimental results on the MICCAI 2009 Fibre Cup phantom [1].

PVA-C is material widely used in medical imaging phantoms for its mechanical similarities to soft tissues. The phantom was cast in a mold designed using the left hemiphere of the Colin27 brain dataset [1] and contains deep sulci, a complete insular region, and an anatomically accurate left ventricle. Marker spheres and inflatable catheters were also implanted to enable good registration and simulate tissue deformation, respectively. The phantom was designed for triple modality imaging, giving good contrast images in computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Multimodal data acquired from this phantom are made freely available to the image processing community (http://pvabrain.inria.fr) and will aid in the validation and further development of medical image processing techniques.

We embed this metric into a hierarchical registration framework, where we show that registration robustness and accuracy can be improved by adapting both the similarity metric and the pixel selection strategy to the Gaussian blurring scale and to the modalities being registered. A computationally efficient estimation of gradient orientations is proposed based on patch-wise rigidity. We have applied our method to both rigid and non-rigid multimodal registration tasks with different modalities. Our approach outperforms mutual information (MI) and previously proposed local approximations of MI for multimodal (e.g. CT/MRI) brain image registration tasks. Furthermore, it shows significant improvements in terms of mTRE over standard methods in the highly challenging clinical context of registering pm-operative brain MRI to intra-operative US images.

We propose using an observer-independent laminar profile-based parcellation method to detect cortical lesions. Following cortical surface extraction, profiles are extended from the white matter surface to the grey matter surface. The cortex is parcellated according to profile intensity and shape features using a k-means classifier. The method is applied to a high-resolution quantitative magnetic resonance data set from a fixed post mortem multiple sclerosis brain, and validated using histology.

In order to develop new treatments and therapies, there is a need to understand MN organization and differentiation. Although recently developed embryo mouse models have enabled the investigation of the MN specialization process, more robust and reproducible methods are required to evaluate the topology and structure of the neuron bundles. In this article, we propose a new fully automatic approach to identify MN clusters from stained histological slices. We developed a specific workflow including inter-slice intensity normalization and slice registration for 3D volume reconstruction, which enables the segmentation, mapping and 3D visualization of MN bundles. Such tools will facilitate the understanding of MN organization, differentiation and function.	[Guizard, Nicolas; Coupe, Pierrick; Collins, D.

One source of measurement error in anatomical MR is magnetic field gradient-induced geometric distortion. This work proposes a method to characterize and compensate for these distortions using a novel image processing technique relying on the image acquisition of a phantom with known geometrical dimensions, without the need to acquire the magnetic field mapping. The method is not specific to any particular shape of the phantom, as long as it provides enough coverage of the volume of interest and enough structure to densely sample the distortion field. The distortions are expressed in terms of spherical harmonic functions, which are then used to define the distortion correction field for the volume of interest. Accuracy of the distortion measurement was evaluated using numerical simulation and reproducibility was estimated using multiple scans of the phantom in the same scanner. Finally, scan-rescan experiments with nine healthy subjects demonstrated that 90% of the distortion (in terms of local volume change) can be corrected with this technique.

The equilibrium-point hypothesis is based on the idea of control with thresholds for activation of neuronal pools; it provides a framework for analysis of both voluntary and involuntary movements. In particular, control of a single muscle can be adequately described with changes in the threshold of motor unit recruitment during slow muscle stretch (threshold of the tonic stretch reflex). Unlike the ideas of internal models, the equilibrium-point hypothesis does not assume neural computations of mechanical variables. The uncontrolled manifold hypothesis is based on the dynamic system approach to movements; it offers a toolbox to analyze synergic changes within redundant sets of elements related to stabilization of potentially important performance variables. The referent configuration hypothesis and the principle of abundance can be naturally combined into a single coherent scheme of control of multi-element systems. A body of experimental data on healthy persons and patients with movement disorders are reviewed in support of the mentioned hypotheses. In particular, movement disorders associated with spasticity are considered as consequences of an impaired ability to shift threshold of the tonic stretch reflex within the whole normal range. Technical details and applications of the mentioned hypotheses to studies of motor learning are described. We view the mentioned hypotheses as the most promising ones in the field of motor control, based on a solid physical and neurophysiological foundation.

Dscams and Turtle (Tutl), two Ig superfamily proteins, have been shown to mediate contact-dependent homotypic interactions in tiling and self-avoidance. By contrast, the Activin pathway regulates axonal tiling in a contact-independent manner. These cell surface signals may directly or indirectly regulate the activity of the Tricornered kinase pathway and/or other intracellular signaling pathways to prevent the overlap between same-type neuronal arbors in the sensory or synaptic input field.

Defects in nuclear translocation, a key process in neuronal positioning, are associated with brain diseases such as lissencephaly in humans. Accumulated evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms controlling neuronal movement are conserved throughout evolution. While the initial events of neuronal migration have been extensively studied, less is known about the molecular details underlying the establishment of neuronal architecture after initial migration. Results: In a search for novel players in the control of photoreceptor (R cell) positioning in the developing fly visual system, we found that misexpression of the RabGAP RN-Tre disrupted the apical localization of R-cell nuclei. RN-Tre interacts with Rab5 and Rab11 in the fly eye. Genetic analysis shows that Rab5, Shi and Rab11 are required for maintaining apical localization of R-cell nuclei. Conclusions: We propose that Rab5, Shi and Rab11 function together in a vesicular transport pathway for regulating R-cell positioning in the developing eye.

In the beginning: A brief history of infant music perception	MUSICAE SCIENTIAE			English	Article							ADULTS PERCEPTION; TONAL STRUCTURE; ABSOLUTE PITCH; MEMORY; PREFERENCES; INTERVALS; PATTERNS; MELODIES; RHYTHMS; CONTOUR	The study of infant music perception began in the 1970s-a time when young infants were considered incapable of holistic processing of auditory sequences. These limitations were reconsidered with the demonstration of infants' configural processing of pitch and timing patterns, which presaged the vibrant field of study that unfolded over subsequent decades. The 1980s revealed the salience of melodic contour for infants as well as adult-like processing of pitch and timing patterns. The 1990s shed new light on intervals and scales, uncovering situations in which infant listeners outperformed their adult counterparts. Scholars in the new millennium have documented a number of factors that influence rhythm perception in infancy, including incidental exposure to music and the experience of movement during music listening. In addition, brain-based measures are shedding light on the musical sensitivities of newborn infants. In sum, the conception of infants vis-a-vis music has changed substantially over the past four decades. Moreover, research in this realm is influencing ongoing debate about the nature and origins of music.

This leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phototoxicity. In this work, we quantify the generation of different forms of ROS from as-synthesized QDs in toluene; water-solubilized, unconjugated QDs; QDs conjugated to the neurotransmitter dopamine; and dopamine alone. Results of indirect fluorescent ROS assays, both in solution and inside cells, are compared with those of spin-trap electron paramagentic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The effect of these particles on the metabolism of mammalian cells is shown to be dependent upon light exposure and proportional to the amount of ROS generated.

Communicating science is challenging, and the transformation of communication by digital and interactive media increases the complexity of the challenge. To facilitate dialogue with the public in this new media landscape, we suggest three courses of action for the neuroscience community: a cultural shift that explicitly recognizes and rewards public outreach, the identification and development of neuroscience communication experts, and ongoing empirical research on the public communication of neuroscience.

In contrast, the sensitivity of the auditory interneuron, ON1 which participates in the processing of both social signals and bat calls, and the thresholds for flight orientation to a model of the calling song of male crickets show few differences between the two populations. Genetic analyses confirm that the two populations are significantly distinct, and we conclude that the absence of bats has caused partial regression in the nervous control of a defensive behaviour in this insect. This study represents the first examination of natural evolutionary regression in the neural basis of a behaviour along a selection gradient within a single species.

It is widely used for pattern recognition, feature extraction, vector quantization (VQ), image segmentation, function approximation, and data mining. As an unsupervised classification technique, clustering identifies some inherent structures present in a set of objects based on a similarity measure. Clustering methods can be based on statistical model identification (McLachlan & Basford, 1988) or competitive learning, In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of competitive learning based clustering methods. Importance is attached to a number of competitive learning based clustering neural networks such as the self-organizing map (SOM), the learning vector quantization (LVQ), the neural gas, and the ART model, and clustering algorithms such as the C-means, mountain/subtractive clustering, and fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithms. Associated topics such as the under-utilization problem, fuzzy clustering, robust clustering, clustering based on non-Euclidean distance measures, supervised clustering, hierarchical clustering as well as cluster validity are also described. Two examples are given to demonstrate the use of the clustering methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A functional polymorphism rs7483 in GSTM3 may contribute to the decrease in GSTM3 expression in AD. The association of the rs7483 SNP with late-onset AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was evaluated and the impact of a SNP background on gene expression was analyzed in blood mononuclear cells (BMC). The allelic association of the GSTM3 allele with AD was significant in women and in APO epsilon 84-negative stratum. A significant association was also found in both MCI and AD subjects with AD family history. GSTM3 transcript levels in BMC were lower in AD than in normal elderly controls, and the presence of the risk allele was associated with further mRNA reduction. Diminished GSTM3 mRNA levels correlated with decreased minichromosome maintenance deficient 3 (MCM3) mRNA levels in a diagnostic and SNP-dependent fashion. Reduced antioxidant defense and genome maintenance associated with the GSTM3 polymorphism suggest a common hub of regulatory networks which, when impaired, may lead to AD. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The blood-brain barrier, formed by the endothelial cells of the brain capillaries. restricts access to brain cells of blood-borne compounds and facilitates nutrients essential for normal metabolism to reach brain cells. This very tight regulation of the brain homeostasis results in the inability of some small and large therapeutic compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, various strategies are being developed to enhance the amount and concentration of therapeutic compounds in the brain. In this review, we will address the different approaches used to increase the transport of therapeutics from blood into the brain parenchyma. We will mainly concentrate on the physiologic approach which takes advantage of specific receptors already expressed on the capillary endothelial cells forming the BBB and necessary for the survival of brain cells. Among all the approaches used for increasing brain delivery of therapeutics, the most accepted method is the use of the physiological approach which takes advantage of the transcytosis capacity of specific receptors expressed at the BBB. The low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) is the most adapted for such use with the engineered peptide Compound (EPiC) platform incorporating the Angiopep peptide in new therapeutics the most advanced with promising data in the clinic.

Phonological training yielded a positive effect on the trained material. Six months after the training, a generalization of the positive impact on the untrained items was also observed. Connectivity analysis showed that training and generalization effects shared paralleled cortical patterns of functional integration. These findings may represent the neurophysiological correlate of the training-induced cognitive strategies for the compensation of anomia.

In the case of risky decision-making, high self-esteem (SE) individuals rely on their positive self-views and tend to be less defensive in response to a risky task; low SE individuals, on the contrary, tend to have fewer accessible positive resources and thus, are more prone to risk-aversion. While past studies have provided evidence for a link between self-esteem and a behaviorally-risky response, no study has explored the relation between self-esteem and the electrophysiological correlates of risky response. Therefore, the current study investigated the correlates of risky decision-making in high SE compared to low SE participants using event-related potentials (ERP) technology in 28 undergraduate students playing a blackjack game. The results showed that there was no difference between the high SE participants and the low SE participants with respect to the behavioral assessments of the risk-taking decision-making. However, for the electrophysiological data, we observed that the amplitude of P2 (150-300 ms) was more positive in the high SE participants compared to the low SE participants over the central-posterior scalp region. Dipole source analysis indicated that this positive component was generated in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). These findings suggest that the high SE participants experienced more emotional signals than the low SE participants during decision-making.

IL-1 or TNF receptor gene deletion delays onset of encephalopathy and attenuates brain edema in experimental acute liver failure	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Azoxymethane; Acute liver failure; Hepatic encephalopathy; Inflammation; Brain edema	MOUSE; CDNA; EXPRESSION; CLONING; HYPOTHERMIA	Previous reports suggested that brain-derived proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and brain edema in acute liver failure (ALF). To further address this issue, expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNAs were measured in the brains of mice with acute liver failure resulting from exposure to azoxymethane. In addition, time to severe encephalopathy (coma) was assessed in mice lacking genes coding for interferon-gamma, the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 or the interleukin-1 type 1 receptor. Interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma expression were quantified using RT-PCR. Significant increases in interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA were observed in the frontal cortex of azoxymethane-treated wild-type mice at coma stages of encephalopathy. Interferon-gamma, however, could not be detected in the brains of these animals. Onset of severe encephalopathy (coma) and brain edema in ALF mice were significantly delayed in interleukin-1 type 1 receptor or tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 knockout mice. Deletion of the interferon-gamma gene, on the other hand, had no significative effect on the neurological status or brain water content of acute liver failure mice. These results demonstrate that toxic liver injury resulting from exposure to azoxymethane is associated with selective induction of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain and that deletion of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 or interlukin-1 type 1 receptor delays the onset of coma and brain edema in this model of acute liver failure. These findings further support a role for selective brain-derived cytokines in the pathogenesis of the cerebral complications in acute liver failure and suggest that anti-inflammatory strategies could be beneficial in their prevention.

Recent findings have shown that transthyretin (TTR) is a potent scavenger of A beta peptide deposits, suggesting a possible neuroprotective role for TTR in neurodegenerative processes associated with amyloidogenesis, such as AD. Methods: To investigate the relationship between TTR and A beta deposition, we crossed mouse carrying a deletion of TTR (TTR-/-) with a transgenic mouse model of AD (TgCRND8), and A beta burden and spatial learning capacities were evaluated at 4 and 6 months of age (exclusion of the 6 month-old TgCRND8/TTR-/- group due to low survival rate). Results: Rather surprisingly, A beta plaque burden was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of 4-month-old TgCRND8/TTR+/-, and to a lesser extent in TgCRND8/TTR-/-, as compared to age-matched TgCRND8/TTR+/+. No difference in plaque burden was found between any groups in 6-month-old animals. At 4 and 6 months of age, all populations of these hybrid transgenic mice displayed similar magnitude of spatial memory deficits in the Morris water maze task. Conclusion: Since TgCRND8 mice represent an aggressive model of A beta deposition with plaques developing as early as 3 months of age, along with spatial learning deficits, it may be already too late at 4 and 6 months of age to observe significant changes due to the deletion of the TTR gene.

Early-Stage Inflammation and Experimental Therapy in Transgenic Models of the Alzheimer-Like Amyloid Pathology	NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases (AD/PD)	MAR 11-15, 2009	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC			Alzheimer's disease; Central nervous system; Inflammation; Intracellular A beta; A beta oligomers and minocycline		Background: Intracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid (A beta) is one of the early features in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome. This can be reproduced in cell and transgenic animal models of the AD-like amyloid pathology. In a transgenic rat model, our lab has previously shown that the intracellular accumulation of A beta is sufficient to provoke cognitive impairments and biochemical alterations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in the absence of amyloid plaques. Objective: To investigate an early, pre-plaque inflammatory process in AD-like transgenic models and establish whether the neurotoxic effects of A beta oligomers and proinflammatory responses can be arrested with minocycline. Methods: For these studies, we used naive mice and transgenic animal models of the AD-like amyloid pathology and applied neurochemical, immunohistochemical and behavioral experimental approaches. Results: In the early stages of the AD-like amyloid pathology, intracellular A beta oligomers accumulate within neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Coincidental with this, behavioral impairments occur prior to the appearance of amyloid plaques, together with an upregulation of MHC-II, i-NOS and COX-2, well-known proinflammatory markers. Treatment with minocycline corrected behavioral impairments, lowered inflammatory markers and levels of A beta trimers. Conclusion: A pharmacological approach targeting the early neuroinflammatory effects of A beta might be a promising strategy to prevent or delay the onset of AD. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

Using tensor-based morphometry, we mapped Volume reductions and gains in 16 early-onset (EB) and 16 late-onset (LB) blind adults (onset < 5 and > 14 years old, respectively) relative to 16 matched sighted controls. Each subject's structural MRI was fluidly registered to a common template. Anatomical differences between groups were mapped based on statistical analysis of the resulting deformation fields revealing profound deficits in primary and secondary visual cortices for both blind groups. Regions outside the occipital lobe showed significant hypertrophy, suggesting widespread compensatory adaptations. EBs but not LBs showed deficits in the splenium and the isthmus. Gains in the non-occipital white matter were more widespread in the EBs. These differences may reflect regional alterations in late neurodevelopmental processes, Such as myelination, that continue into adulthood. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is a data-driven method that imposes minimal constraints on the hemodynamic response function (HRF). In particular, the investigation of HRFs with clear peaks, but varying latency, may be used to differentiate the ictal focus from propagated activity. Methods: ICA was applied on ictal EEG-fMRI data from 15 patients. Components related to seizures were identified by fitting an HRF to the component time courses at the time of the ictal EEG events. HRFs with a clear peak were used to derive maps of significant BOLD responses and their associated peak delay. The results were then compared with those obtained from a general linear model (GLM) method. Concordance with the presumed epileptogenic focus was also assessed. Results: The ICA maps were significantly correlated with the GLM maps for each patient (Spearman's test, p<0.05). The ictal BOLD responses identified by ICA always included the presumed epileptogenic zone, but were also more widespread, accounting for 20.3% of the brain volume on average. The method provided a classification of the components as a function of peak delay. BOLD response clusters associated with early HRF peaks were concordant with the suspected epileptogenic focus, while subsequent HRF peaks may correspond to ictal propagation. Conclusion: ICA applied to EEG-fMRI can detect areas of significant BOLD response to ictal events without having to predefine an HRF. By estimating the HRF peak time in each identified region, the method could also potentially provide a dynamic analysis of ictal BOLD responses, distinguishing onset from propagated activity.

Deciphering the genuine functional neurcranatomy of motor sequence learning, among that of other skills, has thereby been hampered. The main caveat is that changes in neural activity that inherently accompany task practice may not only reflect the learning process per se, but also the basic motor implementation of improved performance. Previous research has attempted to control for a performance confound in brain activity by adopting methodologies that prevent changes in performance. However, blocking the expression of performance is likely to distort the very nature of the motor sequence learning process, and may thus represent a major confound in itself. In the present study, we postulated that both learning-dependent plasticity mechanisms and learning-independent implementation processes are nested within the relationship that exists between performance and brain activity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to map brain responses in healthy volunteers while they either (a) learned a novel sequence, (b) produced a highly automatized sequence or (c) executed non-sequential movements matched for speed frequency. In order to dissociate between qualitatively distinct, but intertwined, relationships between performance and neural activity, our analyses focused on correlations between variations in performance and brain activity, and how this relationship differs or shares commonalities between conditions. Results revealed that activity in the putamen and contralateral lobule VI of the cerebellum most strongly correlated with performance during learning per se, suggesting their key role in this process. By contrast, activity in a parallel cerebellar network, as well as in motor and premotor cortical areas, was modulated by performance during learning and during one or both control condition(s), suggesting the primary contribution of these areas in motor implementation, either as a function or not of the sequential content of movements. Our findings thus highlight the multifaceted nature of the link between performance and brain activity, and suggest that different components of the striato-cortical and cerebello-cortical motor loops play distinct, but complementary, roles during early motor sequence learning.

To determine the role of basal opioid receptor availability in the brain in pain perception, twenty-three healthy Subjects underwent positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing the subtype-nonselective opioid antagonist [F-18]diprenorphine, quantitative sensory testing (QST) and the cold pressor test. Binding potentials (BPs) were calculated using a non-invasive reference tissue model and statistical parametric mapping was applied for t-statistical analysis on a voxelwise basis. We found that cold pain-sensitive subjects present a significantly lower BP in regions including the bilateral insular cortex and the left orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, correlation analysis revealed an inverse correlation between opioid BP in the bilateral motor and premotor region and perceptual wind-up. These findings indicate that interindividual differences in pain perception are partially accounted for by basal opioid receptor availability. A secondary aim of this Study was to investigate the contribution of basal opioid receptor availability to the perception of non-nociceptive stimuli. The following negative correlations between regional opioid BP and scores of QST parameters were found: BP in the right premotor cortex and scores of alternating cold and warm stimuli, BP in the left midcingular cortex and scores of cold detection threshold, BP in the left insula and scores of mechanical detection threshold. These results suggest that the opioid receptor system is involved in the perception not only of pain but also of non-painful somatosensory stimuli. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Associative and rostral premotor cortical and subcortical regions are mostly recruited during the early phase of explicit motor learning, while sensorimotor regions may increase their activity during the late learning phases. Distinct brain networks are therefore engaged during the early and late phases of motor skill learning. How these regions interact with one another and how information is transferred from one circuit to the other has been less extensively studied. In this study, we used functional MRI (fMRI) at 3T to follow the changes in functional connectivity in the associative/premotor and the sensorimotor networks, during extended practice (4 weeks) of an explicitly known sequence of finger movements. Evolution of functional connectivity was assessed using integration, a measure that quantifies the total amount of interaction within a network. When comparing the integration associated with a complex finger movement sequence to that associated with a simple sequence, we observed two patterns of decrease during the 4 weeks of practice. One was not specific as it was observed for all sequences, whereas a specific decrease was observed only for the execution of the learned sequence. This second decrease was a consequence of a relative decrease in associative/premotor network integration, together with a relative increase in between-network integration.

Worldwide, it is considered the first-line mood stabilizer. Apart from its proven antimanic and prophylactic effects, considerable evidence also suggests an antisuicidal effect in affective disorders. Lithium is also effectively used to augment antidepressant drugs in the treatment of refractory major depressive episodes and prevent relapses in recurrent unipolar depression. In contrast to many psychiatric drugs, lithium has outlasted various pharmacotherapeutic 'fashions', and remains an indispensable element in contemporary psychopharmacology. Nevertheless, data from pharmacogenetic studies of lithium are comparatively sparse, and these studies are generally characterized by small sample sizes and varying definitions of response. Here, we present an international effort to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of lithium response in bipolar disorder. Following an initiative by the International Group for the Study of Lithium-Treated Patients (www.IGSLI.org) and the Unit on the Genetic Basis of Mood and Anxiety Disorders at the National Institute of Mental Health, lithium researchers from around the world have formed the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (www.ConLiGen.org) to establish the largest sample to date for genome-wide studies of lithium response in bipolar disorder, currently comprising more than 1,200 patients characterized for response to lithium treatment. A stringent phenotype definition of response is one of the hallmarks of this collaboration. ConLiGen invites all lithium researchers to join its efforts. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

We aimed to examine the neurobiological basis of this difference using functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We compared 12 children with high functioning autism (HFA) to 12 age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls (CTRL) on a pictorial reasoning paradigm under three conditions: V, requiring visuospatial processing; S, requiring language (i.e., semantic) processing; and V+S, a hybrid condition in which language use could facilitate visuospatial transformations. Activated areas in the brain were chosen as endpoints for probabilistic diffusion tractography to examine tract integrity (FA) within the structural network underlying the activation patterns. The two groups showed similar networks, with linguistic processing activating inferior frontal, superior and middle temporal, ventral visual, and temporo-parietal areas, whereas visuospatial processing activated occipital and inferior parietal cortices. However, HFA appeared to activate occipitoparietal and ventral temporal areas, whereas CTRL relied more on frontal and temporal language regions. The increased reliance on visuospatial abilities in HFA was supported by intact connections between the inferior parietal and the ventral temporal ROIs. In contrast, the inferior frontal region showed reduced connectivity to ventral temporal and middle temporal areas in this group, reflecting impaired activation of frontal language areas in autism. The HFA group's engagement of posterior brain regions along with its weak connections to frontal language areas suggest support for a reliance on visual mediation in autism, even in tasks of higher cognition.

In the present study, participants were asked to categorize fear and disgust expressions displayed auditorily, visually, or audio-visually. Results revealed an advantage of women in all the conditions of stimulus presentation. We also observed more nonlinear probabilistic summation in the bimodal conditions in female than male observers, indicating greater neural integration of different sensory-emotional informations. These findings indicate robust differences between genders in the multisensory perception of emotion expression. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For perceptual search, a single shape was shown first (pre-cue) followed by a search-array and the task was to decide whether, the pre-cue was or was not in the search-array. For search of VSTM, a search-array was shown first followed by a single shape (post-cue), and the task was to decide whether the post-cue was or was not in the previously displayed search-array. We focused on early lateralized electrical brain activity over posterior and temporal areas time-locked to search-arrays in pre-cue trials and to post-cues in post-cue trials. In Experiment 1, search-arrays were composed of two lateralized shapes, displayed in the upper/lower two quadrants of the monitor. In Experiment 2, search-arrays were composed of four shapes, displayed at the corners of an imaginary square centered on fixation. In pre-cue trials, we observed an N2pc of about equal amplitude and latency for search-arrays composed of two or four shapes. In post-cue trials, we observed N2pc-like activity with search-arrays composed of two shapes, that was however substantially attenuated with search-arrays composed of four shapes. For many aspects, attending to a perceptual object was functionally and neurally analogous to attending to an object held in VSTM, suggesting that spatial selective attention biases search of objects during both ongoing perception and retention.

Crossmodal recruitment of primary visual cortex following brief exposure to bimodal audiovisual stimuli	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Review						Crossmodal recruitment; Cortical plasticity; Primary visual cortex; Primary auditory cortex; PET imaging; Multisensory processing	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL PLANE; MULTISENSORY INTERACTIONS; CONGENITALLY BLIND; MACAQUE MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; MINDS EYE; AUDIOTACTILE INTERACTION	Several lines of evidence suggest that exposure to only one component of typically audiovisual events can lead to crossmodal cortical activation. These effects are likely explained by long-term associations formed between the auditory and visual components of such events. It is not certain whether such crossmodal recruitment can occur in the absence of explicit conditioning, semantic factors, or long-term association; nor is it clear whether primary sensory cortices can be recruited in such paradigms. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that crossmodal cortical recruitment would occur even after a brief exposure to bimodal stimuli without semantic association. We used positron emission tomography, and an apparatus allowing presentation of spatially and temporally congruous audiovisual stimuli (noise bursts and light flashes). When presented with only the auditory or visual components of the bimodal stimuli, naive subjects showed only modality-specific cortical activation, as expected. However, subjects who had previously been exposed to the audiovisual stimuli showed increased cerebral blood flow in the primary visual cortex when presented with sounds alone. Functional connectivity analysis suggested that the auditory cortex was the source of visual cortex activity. This crossmodal activation appears to be the result of implicit associations of the two stimuli, likely driven by their spatiotemporal characteristics; it was observed after a relatively short period of exposure (similar to 45 min), and lasted for a relatively long period after the initial exposure (similar to 1 day). The findings indicate that auditory and visual cortices interact with one another to a larger degree than typically assumed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, functional reorganization of the auditory pathways as a result of higher-level damage or abnormalities remains poorly investigated. A relatively recent behavioural study points to functional changes in the auditory pathways in some, but interestingly not in all, of the acallosal individuals that were tested. The present study uses fMRI to investigate auditory activities in both cerebral hemispheres in those same acallosal subjects in order to directly investigate the contributions of ipsilateral and contralateral functional pathways reorganization. Predictions were made that functional reorganization could be predicted from behavioural performance. As reported previously in a number of neuroimaging studies, results showed that in neurologically intact subjects, binaural stimulation induced balanced activities between both hemispheres, while monaural stimulation induced strong contralateral activities and weak ipsilateral activities. In accordance with behavioural predictions, some acallosal subjects showed patterns of auditory cortical activities that were similar to those observed in neurologically intact subjects while others showed functional reorganization of the auditory pathways. Essentially they showed a significant increase and a significant decrease of neural activities in the contralateral and/or ipsilateral pathways, respectively. These findings indicate that at least in some acallosal subjects, functional reorganization inside the auditory pathways does contribute to compensate for the absence of the corpus callosum.

Neural networks involved in voluntary and involuntary vocal pitch regulation in experienced singers	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Audio-vocal integration; Auditory feedback; fMRI; Pitch shift; Vocal control	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; VOICE FUNDAMENTAL-FREQUENCY; SHIFTED AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; PROBABILISTIC ATLAS	In an fMRI experiment, we tested experienced singers with singing tasks to investigate neural correlates of voluntary and involuntary vocal pitch regulation. We shifted the pitch of auditory feedback ( 25 or 200 cents), and singers either: (I) ignored the shift and maintained their vocal pitch or (2) changed their vocal pitch to compensate for the shift. In our previous study, singers successfully ignored and compensated for 200-cent shifts; in the present experiment, we hypothesized that singers would be less able to ignore 25-cent shifts, due to a prepotent, corrective pitch-shift response. We expected that voluntary vocal regulation during compensate tasks would recruit the anterior portion of the rostral cingulate zone (RCZa) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), as our earlier study reported: however. we predicted that a different network may be engaged during involuntary responses to 25-cent shifts. Singers were less able to ignore 25-cent shifts than 200-cent shifts, suggesting that pitch-shift responses to small shifts are under less voluntary control than responses to larger shifts. While we did not find neural activity specifically associated with involuntary pitch-shift responses, compensate tasks recruited a functionally connected network consisting of RCZa, pSTS, and anterior insula. Analyses of stimulus-modulated functional connectivity suggest that pSTS and intraparietal sulcus may monitor auditory feedback to extract pitch-shift direction in 200-cent tasks, but not in 25-cent tasks, which suggests that larger vocal corrections are under cortical control. During the compensate tasks, the pSTS may interact with the RCZa and anterior insula before voluntary vocal pitch correction occurs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Neural Circuitry of Executive Functions in Healthy Subjects and Parkinson's Disease	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						executive functions; Parkinson's disease; PET; fMRI; neuroimaging; dopamine	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; THETA-BURST-STIMULATION; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; CARD SORTING TEST; STRIATAL DOPAMINE RELEASE; LATERAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX	In our constantly changing environment, we are frequently faced with altered circumstances requiring generation and monitoring of appropriate strategies, when novel plans of action must be formulated and conducted. The abilities that we call upon to respond accurately to novel situations are referred to as 'executive functions', and are frequently engaged to deal with conditions in which routine activation of behavior would not be sufficient for optimal performance. Here, we summarize important findings that may help us understand executive functions and their underlying neuronal correlates. We focus particularly on observations from imaging technology, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, position emission tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation, which in the past few years have provided the bulk of information on the neurobiological underpinnings of the executive functions. Further, emphasis will be placed on recent insights from Parkinson's disease (PD), in which the underlying dopaminergic abnormalities have provided new exciting information into basic molecular mechanisms of executive dysfunction, and which may help to disentangle the cortical/subcortical networks involved in executive processes.

Inherited cavernous malformations of the central nervous system: clinical and genetic features in 19 Swiss families	NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Cavernous malformations; Genetics; CCM1; CCM2; Surgical outcome	CHROMOSOME 7Q; NATURAL-HISTORY; MUTATIONS; LINKAGE; LOCUS; KRIT1; HETEROGENEITY; ANGIOMAS; PROTEIN; BRAIN	Cavernous malformations (CCMs) are benign, well-circumscribed, and mulberry-like vascular malformations that may be found in the central nervous system in up to 0.5% of the population. Cavernous malformations can be sporadic or inherited. The common symptoms are epilepsy, hemorrhages, focal neurological deficits, and headaches. However, CCMs are often asymptomatic. The familiar form is associated with three gene loci, namely 7q21-q22 (CCM1), 7p13-p15 (CCM2), and 3q25.2-q27 (CCM3) and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. The CCM genes are identified as Krit 1 (CCM1), MGC4607 (CCM2), and PDCD10 (CCM3). Here, we present the clinical and genetic features of CCMs in 19 Swiss families. Furthermore, surgical aspects in such families are also discussed.	[Siegel, A. M.] Neuroctr Bellevue, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [Graeni, C.; Baumann, C.

Lessons Learned: Impact of a Continence Promotion Activity for Older Community-Dwelling Women	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Article						continence promotion; healthcare seeking; effectiveness	HEALTH-CARE-SEEKING; URINARY-INCONTINENCE; HELP-SEEKING; SYMPTOMS; BEHAVIOR; ADULTS; PEOPLE; AGE	Aims: Few studies have documented the effectiveness of continence promotion programs targeting older incontinent women. We sought to evaluate the impact of an interactive continence workshop on changing participants' attitudes, knowledge and skills in relation to self-managing or seeking care for incontinence. Methods: A quasi-experimental prospective cohort study with repeated measures was carried out on a population of 90 incontinent women aged 55-87 participating in a continence promotion workshop. Inclusion criteria were a weekly average of one or more episodes of involuntary urine loss during the preceding 3 months and having never sought help for this problem. Incontinence-related knowledge, attitudes, skills and intentions for seeking care were assessed immediately prior and subsequent to the workshop. Three- and 6-month telephone follow-ups were conducted to determine rates of healthcare seeking and reasons for not seeking care. Results: Improvements in incontinence-related knowledge and attitudes occurred in up to 94% participants. Forty-three percent of the study participants initiated and were satisfied with self-treatment, and an additional 42% consulted a health care professional. Conclusion: Interactive continence workshops promote self-management and consultation seeking among older women with incontinence. Further testing of different strategies for promoting continence awareness needs to occur in larger studies with more sensitive instruments, a control group, and better specification of the goals, process and outcomes of the health promotion activity being tested.

Potential Insights Into Lower Urinary Function Derived From CNS Imaging	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Review						functional imaging; LUTS; neurophysiology	BLADDER CONTROL; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; RESPONSES; CORTEX; INCONTINENCE; STIMULATION; WOMEN; CAT	Powerful advances in central nervous system (CNS) imaging technology offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify which CNS structures coordinate lower urinary tract (LUT) function in health and disease. Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have already yielded preliminary insights into the neural control of continence mechanisms and their dysfunction. Such technologies have also enabled researchers to begin investigating the changes in CNS activity that occur with age, or after implementation of incontinence therapies, such as sacral neuromodulation. Nonetheless, the use of CNS imaging for understanding LUT function remains in a state of infancy. Several challenges, such as the relative spatial and temporal resolutions of the different technologies, and valid and reliable interpretation of the findings under non-physiological conditions, limit the ability to constructively understand LUT control. This paper reviews state-of-the-art CNS knowledge, discusses issues related to the use of CNS technology in LUT research, and raises key questions that need to be addressed. Neurourol.

They emphasized simple, non-invasive methods, easily available, for eyes tracking, blink rate and blink speed measurements electrodermal activities (e.g., galvanic skin response) measurements, and heart/respiration rate for their potential to reflect decreasing attention, increasing visual or cognitive information load, task difficulty, tension, arousal, stress and fatigue of the learning subject. The present paper highlights the advantages and constraints of different data acquisition approaches and methods (including technical and physiological), as well as constraints, caused by the hardware and software limits, by the necessity of individual setup (often continuous), by the problems with real time data processing, including wrong data recognition and elimination, etc. Analyzing the data of GSR, EEG and eye tracking studies (with the sample size of 6, later 8) employing a wide range of cognitive tasks, the authors recommend fast signal processing methods, e.g., real time fast Fourier transformation, which, till now, have been rarely used for physiological data mining and processing in virtual learning environments.

In vitro, the antiangiogenic biological activity of propranolol was shown to inhibit human brain microvascular endothelial cell tubulogenesis. However, -possible interference of propranolol with cell signaling associated with the tumoral compartment remains unexplored. We therefore assessed the potency of propranolol against a pediatric brain tumor-derived DAOY medulloblastoma cell model. Gene expression of beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenergic receptors was confirmed in DAOY cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR. We next found that propranolol dose-dependently inhibited induction of the key extracellular matrix-degrading and blood-brain barrier disrupting enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Propranolol not only inhibited PMA-induced phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), but also that of IkappaB (I kappa B), preventing the I kappa B phosphorylation which is a prerequisite for I kappa B degradation. Propranolol inhibition of I kappa B phosphorylation was shown to occur with optimal efficacy at 30 mu M. Although propranolol, at up to 100 mu M, did not affect cell viability, it potentiated PMA-mediated signaling that ultimately led to diminished phosphorylation of Akt. The anti-Erk and anti-Akt phosphorylation effects are both suggestive of antiproliferative and antisurvival signaling, respectively. Our data are therefore indicative of a pharmacological role for propranolol against beta-adrenergic receptor signaling functions involving the nuclear factor-kappaB-mediated regulation of MMP-9.

The present study investigated the relation between visceral hypersensitivity, cutaneous thermal sensitivity, and central pain mechanisms. Rectal sensitivity was assessed with a barostat, and forearm and calf sensitivity with a contact thermode. Central mechanisms were assessed by counterirritation using sustained cold-pain to the hand and painful electric shocks to the ankle. Psychological symptoms were also assessed, using questionnaires. Female volunteers with diarrhea-predominant IBS (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 25) participated in the study. IBS patients had lower rectal and calf pain thresholds compared to controls (p's < 0.05). IBS patients also reported more pain than controls for rectal distensions, and heat pain on the calf and forearm (all p's < 0.001). Cold-pain inhibited shock-pain in controls but not IBS patients (controls: -13.5 +/- 5.3 vs IBS: + 1.9 +/- 10.5; p < 0.01). In addition, visceral hypersensitivity was significantly correlated to cutaneous thermal hypersensitivity and pain inhibition deficits, although effects were only weak and moderate, respectively. Furthermore, covariance analyses indicated that psychological factors accounted for group differences in visceral hypersensitivity and pain inhibition deficits. In conclusion, this study confirms the relation between altered pain inhibition processes and widespread hypersensitivity in IBS. The present results also suggests that psychological symptoms and altered pain processing in IBS patients may reflect at least in part, common underlying mechanisms.

J	Coderre, TJ; Bennett, GJ				Coderre, Terence J.; Bennett, Gary J.			A Hypothesis for the Cause of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome-Type I (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy): Pain Due to Deep-Tissue Microvascular Pathology	PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						CRPS; RSD; Pain; Deep Tissue Microvascular Dysfunction	ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY; FACILITATED NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATION; CHRONIC POSTISCHEMIA PAIN; SKELETAL-MUSCLE ISCHEMIA; NO-REFLOW; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; COMPARTMENT SYNDROME; MYOCARDIAL-ISCHEMIA; FREE-RADICALS; NITRIC-OXIDE	Complex regional pain syndrome-type I (CRPS-I; reflex sympathetic dystrophy) is a chronic pain condition that usually follows a deep-tissue injury such as fracture or sprain. The cause of the pain is unknown. We have developed an animal model (chronic post-ischemia pain) that creates CRPS-I-like symptomatology. The model is produced by occluding the blood flow to one hind paw for 3 hours under general anesthesia. Following reperfusion, the treated hind paw exhibits an initial phase of hyperemia and edema. This is followed by mechano-hyperalgesia, mechano-allodynia, and cold-allodynia that lasted for at least 1 month. Light microscopic analyses and electron microscopic analyses of the nerves at the site of the tourniquet show that the majority of these animals have no sign of injury to myelinated or unmyelinated axons. However, electron microscopy shows that the ischemia-reperfusion injury produces a microvascular injury, slow-flow/no-reflow, in the capillaries of the hind paw muscle and digital nerves. We propose that the slow-flow/no-reflow phenomenon initiates and maintains deep-tissue ischemia and inflammation, leading to the activation of muscle nociceptors, and the ectopic activation of sensory afferent axons due to endoneurial ischemia and inflammation. These data, and a large body of clinical evidence, suggest that in at least a subset of CRPS-I patients, the fundamental cause of the abnormal pain sensations is ischemia and inflammation due to microvascular pathology in deep tissues, leading to a combination of inflammatory and neuropathic pain processes. Moreover, we suggest a unifying idea that relates the pathogenesis of CRPS-I to that of CRPS-II. Lastly, our hypothesis suggests that the role of the sympathetic nervous system in CRPS-I is a factor that is not fundamentally causative, but may have an important contributory role in early-stage disease.

They are characterized by an endogenous production of abnormal proteins called amyloid proteins (AP), which are not hydrosoluble, form depots, and are only partly cleared by autophagy and the ubiquitin-protease system. Despite their different structures, they are probably generated by a common pathological pathway, a misfolding process. This hypothesis suggests a common pharmacological approach, which can consist of either the blockade of the misfolding process, the elimination of AP or both. The currently validated treatments are mostly palliative ones, trying to supplant the function of destroyed neurons. New trends involve the regulation of the cerebral cholesterol metabolism and the preservation of neuron mitochondrial functions. Special attention is given to already marketed drugs used for other indications, which are also able to act on neurodegeneration. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

This article discusses four negative emotions (righteous anger, indignation, contempt, and disgust) and examines their relationship to punitive behavior. I argue that righteous anger and indignation are both punitive emotions strictly speaking, but induce punishments of different intensity and have distinct elicitors. Contempt and disgust, for their part, cannot be straightforwardly considered punitive emotions, although they often blend with a colder form of indignation to favor low-cost, indirect, and collective forms of punishment such as mockery, exclusion, and ostracism.

The most dominant method to conduct this kind of study is protocol analysis. However, this method is prone to subjective factors. Therefore, other approaches are emerging, which can measure the brain activities directly. With the advances in technologies, brain scanner and brain recorder systems such as EEG, fMRI, PET have become more affordable. In the present research, we used EEG to record designer's brain electrical signals when s/he was working on a design task. Six channels of the EEG signals were recorded, including Fp1, Fp2, Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz, based on which the power spectral density for each EEG band (delta, theta, alpha and beta) was calculated. The results showed that, for the given design problem, the subject spent more effort in visual thinking during the solution generation than that in solution evaluation. The preliminary success in identifying regularity underlying a single designer's design process through EEG signals lays a foundation for further investigation of designers' general mental efforts during the conceptual design process.

Such a system can reduce the project cycle time or allow more time to produce a better design by providing solution ideas to a designer or by upgrading existing design solutions while the designer is not at work. This paper presents an approach to automating the process of designing a gas turbine engine rotor disc using case-based reasoning (CBR), combined with a new genetic algorithm, the Genetic Algorithm with Territorial core Evolution (GATE). GATE was specifically created to solve problems in the mechanical structural design field, and is essentially a real number genetic algorithm that prevents new individuals from being born too close to previously evaluated solutions. The restricted area becomes smaller or larger during optimization to allow global or local searches when necessary. The CBR process uses a databank filled with every known solution to similar design problems. The closest solutions to the current problem in terms of specifications are selected, along with an estimated solution from an artificial neural network. Each solution selected by the CBR is then used to initialize the population of a GATE island. Our results show that CBR may significantly upgrade the performance of an optimization algorithm when sufficient preliminary information is known about the design problem. It provides an average solution 5.0% lighter than the average solution found using random initialization. The results are compared to other results obtained for the same problems by four optimization algorithms from the I-SIGHT 3.5 software: the sequential quadratic programming algorithm (SQP), the insular genetic algorithm (GA), the Hookes & Jeeves generalized pattern search (HJ) and POINTER. Results show that GATE can be a very good candidate for automating and accelerating the structural design of a gas turbine engine rotor disc, providing an average disc 18.9% lighter than SQP, 11.2% lighter than HI, 23.9% lighter than GA and 4.3% lighter than POINTER, even when starting with the same solution set.

This paper presents a practical and effective optimization approach to minimize 3D-related flow losses by re-staggering and re-stacking the blades. This approach is applied to the redesign of a low speed high subsonic single stage turbine, that was designed and tested in Hannover, Germany. The optimization is performed at the design point and the objective function is given by a weighted sum of individual objectives, namely stage efficiency and stream wise vorticity downstream of the rotor and stator and is penalized with one constraint, namely the design mass flow rate. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is coupled with a Response Surface Approximation (RSA) of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) type. A relatively small data set of high fidelity 3D flow simulations that is obtained using Fluent, is used to train and test the ANN model. The variation of stagger angle and stacking are parametrically represented using a quadratic rational Bezier curve (QRBC). The QRBC parameters are directly related to the design variables, namely the rotor and stator lean & sweep angles, and their stagger distribution. Moreover it results in eliminating infeasible shapes and in reducing the number of design variables to a minimum while providing a wide design space for the blade shape. This optimization approach results in an improvement of 1.74% to 1.91% in stage efficiency. This optimization approach is found to be helpful in understanding the physical implications of the design variables and in interpreting their effect on the stage performance.

The main objectives of the optimization are to maximize the stage efficiency and simultaneously minimize the von Mises stress while constraining the design mass flow rate and the blade first natural frequency The stacking curve, which controls three-dimensional flow effects and the spanwise stress distribution is parametrically represented by a quadratic rational Bezier curve (QRBC). The parameters of this QRBC are related to the design variables namely the blade lean, sweep and bow. The optimization method combines a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), with a Response Surface Approximation (RSA) of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) type. During the optimization process, each objective function and constraint is approximated by an individual ANN, which is trained and tested using an aerodynamic as well as a structure database composed of a few high fidelity flow simulations (CFD) and structure analysis (CSD) that are obtained using ANSYS Workbench 2.0. This methodology was then applied to the aero-structural optimization of the E/TU-3 turbine stage at design conditions and proved quite successful, flexible and practical, and resulted in an 0.8% improvement in stage efficiency and about 50% reduction in the maximum von Mises stresses. This improvement was accomplished with as low as five design variables, which is remarkable considering the problem complexity	[Sivashanmugam, Vadivel K.; Arabnia, Mohammad; Ghaly, Wahid] Concordia Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada	Ghaly, W (reprint author), Concordia Univ, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.	s_vadiv@encs.concordia.ca; m_arabni@enes.concordia.ca; ghaly@encs.concordia.ca						30	0	0	0	0	AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS	NEW YORK	THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA			978-0-7918-4402-1				2010							967	980				14	Engineering, Mechanical	Engineering	BVC10	WOS:000291010300083		No			2017-07-26

Its expression by other tissues was later established.

Few comprehensive models exist that integrate multidisciplinary perspectives and explain the multitude of factors that influence the emergence and expression of social skills. Here, a developmental biopsychosocial model (SOCIAL) is offered that incorporates the biological underpinnings and socio-cognitive skills that underlie social function (attention/executive function, communication, socio-emotional skills), as well as the internal and external (environmental) factors that mediate these skills. The components of the model are discussed in the context of the social brain network and are Supported by evidence from 3 conditions known to affect social functioning (autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury). This integrative model is intended to provide a theoretical structure for understanding the origins of social dysfunction and the factors that influence the emergence of social skills through childhood and adolescence in both healthy and clinical populations.

Stress regulation in the central nervous system: evidence from structural and functional neuroimaging studies in human populations-2008 Curt Richter Award Winner	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review						Stress; Cortisol; Hippocampus; Personality; Structural magnetic resonance imaging; Functional magnetic resonance imaging	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; GLUCOCORTICOID-INDUCED IMPAIRMENT; PITUITARY-ADRENOCORTICAL AXIS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MATERNAL-CARE; OLDER-ADULTS	The metabolic effects of stress are known to have significant health effects in both humans and animals. Most of these effects are mediated by the major stress hormonal axis in the body, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Within the central nervous system (CNS), the hippocampus, the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex as part of the limbic system are believed to play important rates in the regulation of the HPA axis. With the advent of structural and functional neuroimaging techniques, the rote of different CNS structures in the regulation of the HPA axis can be investigated more directly. In the current paper, we summarize the findings obtained in our laboratory in the context of stress and HPA axis regulation. Our laboratory has developed and contributed to the development of manual and automated segmentation protocols from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for assessment of hippocampus, amygdala, medial. temporal lobe and frontal lobe structures. Employing these protocols, we could show significant age-related changes in HC volumes, which were different between men and women, with pre-menopausal women showing smaller age-related volume decline compared to men. We could recently extent these findings by showing how estrogen therapy after menopause leads to higher volumes in the HC. Investigating possible neurotoxicity effects of steroids, we showed effects of long-term steroid exposure on HC volumes, and investigated variability of HC volumes in relation to HPA axis regulation in young and elderly populations. Here, we were able to follow-up from non-imaging studies showing that subjects tow in self-esteem have higher cortisol stress responses, and the HC emerged as the critical link between these variables. Recently, we have made two more important discoveries with regard to HC volume: we could show that HC volume is as variable in young as it is in older adults, in subjects ranging in age from 18 to 80 years. Also, we have linked birth weight and maternal care to HC volumes in young adults, demonstrating the effects of variations in maternal care on the integrity of the CNS. Besides structural assessments, there is increasing interest in functional techniques to investigate possible links between CNS activity and HPA axis regulation. These two approaches complement each other; some aspects of HPA axis regulation might be linked to the integrity of a specific CNS structure, while other aspects might be linked to the function of a specific structure with no involvement of CNS morphology. Thus, we have developed a mental arithmetic stress task that can be employed in functional neuroimaging studies, and have used it in a number of functional neuroimaging studies. Employing positron emission tomography (PET), we were able to demonstrate that stress causes dopamine release if subjects reported low maternal care early in life. Finally, employing the task in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we could show how exposure to stress and activation of the HPA axis are associated with decreased activity in major portions of the limbic system, a result that allows to speculate on the effects of stress on cognitive and emotional regulation in the brain. Taken together, the use of neuroimaging techniques in Psychoneuroendocrinology opens exciting new possibilities for the investigation of stress effects in the central nervous system.

Neuroadaptations within the dopaminergic system have been shown to be involved both in the induction phase and in the long-term expression phase of sensitization upon drug readministration after withdrawal. Mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT-KO) were used to test the effect of constitutive hyperdopaminergia on the durability of behavioral sensitization to both cocaine and ethanol. The effect of the DAT mutation was simultaneously tested on two inbred genetic backgrounds, C57Bl/6 and DBA/2, chosen for their contrasting addiction-related phenotypes, as well as on the hybrid F(1) offspring of a cross between C57Bl/6 and DBA/2 congenic strains. In spite of the absence of the DAT, mutant mice were able to develop long-term expression of sensitization to cocaine. Compared to their wild-type littermates, DAT-KO mice exhibited a markedly increased acute ethanol-evoked locomotor activity and developed stronger behavioral sensitization to ethanol during both induction and long-term expression phases. Interestingly, this increased ethanol-induced sensitization was potentiated by the DBA/2 genetic background. These findings, showing that DAT deletion facilitates sensitization, suggest a cross-sensitization-like effect between genetic- and pharmacological-induced hyperdopaminergia.

Studies have demonstrated differences in distinct components of the endogenous opioid system in various brain regions associated with the process of reinforcement between the AA and ANA lines of rats. The goal of this current study was to investigate the hypotheses that the AA and ANA rats will show differences in the release of beta-endorphin at the level of nucleus accumbens (NAC) and in locomotor activity in response to acute systemic administration of ethanol. AA and ANA rats were unilaterally implanted with a guide cannula to aim microdialysis probes at the level of NAC. Intraperitoneal injections of 0.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 g ethanol/kg body weight were administered. Dialysate samples were collected at 30-min intervals prior to and following the injection. Radioimmunoassay specific for beta-endorphin was used to determine the dialysate beta-endorphin content. The 2.5-g/kg ethanol dose induced a transient increase in extracellular beta-endorphin at the level of NAC of AA but not of ANA rats. The 2.5-g/kg ethanol dose also attenuated locomotor activity in the AA but not in the ANA rats. The lack of an increase in the beta-endorphin concentration in the NAC of ANA rats in response to ethanol may partially account for their lower alcohol consumption and lower alcohol-induced attenuation of locomotor activity compared to AA rats.

A Prospective, Randomized Comparison Between Single- and Double-Injection Ultrasound-Guided Infraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							NEUROSTIMULATION	Background: This prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study compared single- and double-injection ultrasound-guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block for upper extremity surgery. Methods: Eighty-eight patients were randomly allocated to receive a single-injection (n = 44) or double-injection (n = 44) ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block. The main outcome variable was the onset time. A blinded observer recorded the onset time, block-related pain scores, success rate (surgical anesthesia), and the incidence of complications. Performance time (defined as the sum of imaging and needling times) and the number of needle passes were also recorded during the performance of the block. The total anesthesia-related time was defined as the sum of the performance and onset times. Results: No differences in imaging, needling, performance, and onset and total anesthesia-related times were found between the 2 groups. There were no differences in the rate of surgical anesthesia (93.1%-97.7%). The number of needle passes was also similar, however, the double-injection technique resulted in slightly less procedural discomfort (1.1 [SD, 1.6] vs 2.1 [SD, 2.1]; P = 0.021). There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events. Conclusion: The double-injection ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block provides no significant advantages compared with its single-injection counterpart.	[Tran, De Q.

With the investigation of a variety of cognitive and behavioral abilities, multiple stages of memory were further suggested to benefit from the offline reprocessing believed to occur during specific sleep stages. In particular, REM sleep has been implicated in the integration of new information into associative networks as well as in the abstraction and generalization of implicit rules allowing adaptive behaviors. In a recent study, we extended these observations by demonstrating that the mediating effect of expectation on placebo-induced analgesia is strengthened by sleep, and that the individual amount of REM sleep is predictive of the relief expected on the next morning /50/. However, this relation is strongly modulated by the level of concordance between expectations and sensory information available prior to sleep. As placebo responses derive from the learned association between contextual cues and subsequent relief, these results are discussed in relation to the proposed roles of REM sleep in the integrative stages of memory processing. In light of the responsiveness of REM sleep to waking events, its expression is also proposed to reflect the cognitive demand associated with the offline reprocessing of information necessary for the assimilation of new expectations to one's belief system.

The model was produced by using the support vector machine (SVM) technique to develop quantitative relationships between the anti-HIV activity and ten molecular descriptors of 89 TIBO derivatives. The performance and predictive capability of the SVM method were investigated and compared with other techniques such as artificial neural networks and multiple linear regression. The results obtained indicate that the SVM model with the kernel radial basis function can be successfully used to predict the anti-HIV activity of TIBO derivatives with only ten molecular descriptors that can be calculated directly from only molecular structure. The contribution of each descriptor to the structure-activity relationships was evaluated. Hydrophobicity of the molecule was thus found to take the most relevant part in the molecular description.

Research in this field has now begun to concentrate on finding explanations for this sex difference. Although sex differences in sociocultural, psychological, and experiential factors likely play important roles, evidence largely from animal studies has revealed surprisingly robust and often qualitative sex differences at low levels of the neuraxis. Although not yet able to affect clinical practice, the continued study of sex differences in pain may have important implications for the development of new analgesic strategies.

Orbito-frontal lesions cause impairment during late but not early emotional prosodic processing	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Emotion; Vocal expression; Prosody; ERPs	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL RESPONSES; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; INTONATION; SPEECH; MONKEY; FMRI; LATERALIZATION; IDENTIFICATION	The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is functionally linked to a variety of cognitive and emotional functions. In particular, lesions of the human OFC lead to large-scale changes in social and emotional behavior. For example, patients with OFC lesions are reported to suffer from deficits in affective decision-making, including impaired emotional face and voice expression recognition (e.g., Hornak et al., 1996, 2003). However, previous studies have failed to acknowledge that emotional processing is a multistage process. Thus, different stages of emotional processing (e.g., early vs. late) in the same patient group could be affected in a qualitatively different manner. The present study investigated this possibility and tested implicit emotional speech processing in an ERP experiment followed by an explicit behavioral emotional recognition task. OFC patients listened to vocal emotional expressions of anger, fear, disgust, and happiness compared to a neutral baseline spoken either with or without lexical content. In line with previous evidence (Paulmann Kotz, 2008b), both patients and healthy controls differentiate emotional and neutral prosody within 200 ms (P200). However, the recognition of emotional vocal expressions is impaired in OFC patients as compared to healthy controls. The current data serve as first evidence that emotional prosody processing is impaired only at a late, and not at an early processing stage in OFC patients.

SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Review							HIGH-INTENSITY EXERCISE; TIME-TRIAL PERFORMANCE; MOUSE SKELETAL-MUSCLE; RAT PLANTARIS MUSCLE; STIMULATION IN-SITU; PROLONGED STRENUOUS EXERCISE; CHAIN AMINO-ACIDS; NA+-K+ PUMP; ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE; RUNNING PERFORMANCE	It is well established that carbohydrate (CHO) administration increases performance during prolonged exercise in humans and animals. The mechanism(s), which could mediate the improvement in exercise performance associated with CHO administration, however, remain(s) unclear. This review focuses on possible underlying mechanisms that could explain the increase in exercise performance observed with the administration of CHO during prolonged muscle contractions in humans and animals. The beneficial effect of CHO ingestion on performance during prolonged exercise could be due to several factors including (i) an attenuation in central fatigue; (ii) a better maintenance of CHO oxidation rates; (iii) muscle glycogen sparing; (iv) changes in muscle metabolite levels; (v) reduced exercise-induced strain; and (vi) a better maintenance of excitation-contraction coupling. In general, the literature indicates that CHO ingestion during exercise does not reduce the utilization of muscle glycogen. In addition, data from a meta-analysis suggest that a dose-dependent relationship was not shown between CHO ingestion during exercise and an increase in performance. This could support the idea that providing enough CHO to maintain CHO oxidation during exercise may not always be associated with an increase in performance. Emerging evidence from the literature shows that increasing neural drive and attenuating central fatigue may play an important role in increasing performance during exercise with CHO supplementation. In addition, CHO administration during exercise appears to provide protection from disrupted cell homeostasis/integrity, which could translate into better muscle function and an increase in performance. Finally, it appears that during prolonged exercise when the ability of metabolism to match energy demand is exceeded, adjustments seem to be made in the activity of the Na(+)/K(+) pump. Therefore, muscle fatigue could be acting as a protective mechanism during prolonged contractions. This could be alleviated when CHO is administered resulting in the better maintenance of the electrical properties of the muscle fibre membrane. The mechanism(s) by which CHO administration increases performance during prolonged exercise is(are) complex, likely involving multiple factors acting at numerous cellular sites. In addition, due to the large variation in types of exercise, durations, intensities, feeding schedules and CHO types it is difficult to assess if the mechanism(s) that could explain the increase in performance with CHO administration during exercise is(are) similar in different situations. Experiments concerning the identification of potential mechanism(s) by which performance is increased with CHO administration during exercise will add to our understanding of the mechanism(s) of muscle/central fatigue. This knowledge could have significant implications for improving exercise performance.

SCT scores are meant to measure the degree of concordance between the performance of examinees and that of the reference panel. Raw test scores have meaning only if statistics (mean and standard deviation) describing the panel's performance are concurrently provided. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to suggest a method for reporting scores that standardizes panel mean and standard deviation, allowing examinees to immediately gauge their performance relative to panel members. Methods: Based on a statistical method of standardization, a new method for computing SCT scores is described. According to this method, test raw scores are converted into a scale in which the panel mean is set as the value of reference, and the standard deviation of the panel serves as a yardstick by which examinee performance is measured. Results: The effect of this transformation on four data sets obtained from SCTs in radio-oncology, surgery, neurology, and nursing is discussed. Conclusion: This transformation method proposes a common metric basis for reporting SCT scores and provides examinees with clear, interpretable insights into their performance relative to that of physicians of the field. We recommend reporting SCT scores with the mean and standard deviation of panel scores set at standard scores of 80 and 5, respectively. Beyond SCT, our transformation method may be generalizable to the scoring of other test formats in which the performance of examinees and those of a panel of reference undertaking the same cognitive tasks are compared.

Several studies reported their ability to affect amphibian and mammalian development. Retinoids, supplied in the diet or synthesized by cells, are essential to embryogenesis. Disturbance of their homeostasis may lead to teratogenic effects. Retinoic acid (RA) is a major retinoid regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. Previous studies reported alterations of retinoid stores in bullfrogs of Yamaska River subwatersheds (Quebec, Canada), a region of intensive agricultural activities associated with atrazine, nitrate, and nitrite contaminants. These contaminants could affect RA metabolism and RA-mediated processes. Mouse P19 embryonic stem cells, which can differentiate to neurons in response to RA, were used to test this hypothesis. Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of contaminants during neuroinduction with RA and assayed by flow cytometry for expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA1) (embryonic marker) and beta III-tubulin (neuronal marker). Cell cultures were also analyzed for RA metabolism by high performance liquid chromotagraphy (HPLC). Downregulation of SSEA1 paralleled beta III-tubulin upregulation in an RA concentration-dependent manner. Atrazine, nitrate, and nitrite did not affect differentiation at environmentally encountered micromolar concentrations. However, low molar nitrite prevented RA-induced SSEA1 downregulation and decreased beta III-tubulin appearance. Decreased cell viability/proliferation accompanied these differentiation effects. P19 cells metabolized RA to polar retinoids. RA metabolism was not affected at any concentration of atrazine, nitrate, or nitrite. Environmentally relevant levels of these contaminants, thus, had no gross effect on neurodifferentiation and RA catabolism of embryonic stem cells. P19 cell-based bioassays may provide valuable tools in monitoring developmental toxicity.

The goal of this study was to measure the effect of a psychoneurotherapy on brain source generators of abnormal EEG activity in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Thirty participants with unipolar MDD were recruited in the community. The proposed psychoneurotherapy was developed based on the relationship between the localization of abnormal EEG activity and depressive symptomatology. Brain electromagnetic abnormalities in MDD were identified with low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and a normative EEG database. Localization of brain changes after treatment was assessed through the standardized version of LORETA (sLORETA). Before treatment, excessive high-beta (1830 Hz) activity was noted in several brain regions located in the fronto-temporal regions. After treatment, only participants who successfully normalized EEG activity in cortico-limbic/paralimbic regions could be considered in clinical remission. In these regions, significant correlations were found between the percentage of change of depressive symptoms and the percentage of reduction in high-beta activity. These results suggest that the normalization of high-beta activity in corticor-limbic/paralimbic regions can be associated with a significant reduction of depressive symptoms.

This conditioned ejaculatory preference reflects an association between the odor and the reward state induced by ejaculation. Although little is known about the neuronal mechanisms that mediate this form of learning, convergence of genitosensory and olfactory inputs occurs in both hypothalamic and cortical regions, notably within primary olfactory (piriform) cortex, which may be involved in the encoding or storage of the association. The present study contrasted the ability of genital investigations, mounts, intromissions, ejaculations, and a sexually conditioned olfactory stimulus, to enhance evoked synaptic field potentials in the piriform cortex. Rats in the Paired group underwent conditioning trials in which they copulated with sexually receptive females bearing an almond odor. Rats in the Unpaired control group copulated with receptive females bearing no odor. Responses in the piriform cortex evoked by electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb were recorded in male rats as they engaged in different aspects of sexual behavior, and were also recorded after conditioning, during exposure to cotton swabs bearing the almond odor. The monosynaptic component of responses was increased during intromission and ejaculation, and the late component of responses was increased during anogenital sniffing and mounting (with or without intromission). However, no differences in the amplitudes of evoked responses were found between the Paired and Unpaired groups, and no differences in synaptic responses were found during presentation of the odor after conditioning. These data indicate that short-term alterations in synaptic responsiveness occur in piriform cortex as a function of sexual stimulation in the male rat, but that responses are not significantly altered by a conditioned odor.

Here we identify an enhancer function of HuD in translation. Translation stimulation by HuD requires both a 3' poly(A) tail and a 5' m(7)G cap structure. We also show that HuD directly interacts with eIF4A. This interaction and the poly(A)-binding activity of HuD are critical for its translational enhancer function because HuD-eIF4A- and HuD-poly(A)-binding mutants fail to stimulate translation. We show that translation of HCV IRES mRNA, which is eIF4A independent, is not stimulated by HuD. We also find that the eIF4A and poly(A)-binding activities of HuD are not only important for stimulating translation but also are essential for HuD-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. This example of cap-dependent translational regulation might explain at least in part how HuD triggers the induction of neuronal differentiation.

SH3 Domains from a Subset of BAR Proteins Define a Ubl-Binding Domain and Implicate Parkin in Synaptic Ubiquitination	MOLECULAR CELL			English	Article							CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE-5; EGF RECEPTOR TRAFFICKING; DISEASE GENE-PRODUCT; VESICLE ENDOCYTOSIS; MEMBRANE CURVATURE; MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS; NERVE-TERMINALS; LIGASE ACTIVITY; CELL-DEATH; DYNAMIN-I	Mutations in the parkin gene are responsible for a common inherited form of Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase with an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl). We report here that the parkin Ubl binds SH3 domains from endocytic BAR proteins such as endophilin-A with an affinity comparable to proline-rich domains (PRDs) from well-established SH3 partners. The NMR structure of the Ubl-SH3 complex identifies the PaRK extension, a unique C-terminal motif in the parkin Ubl required for SH3 binding and for parkin-mediated ubiquitination of endophilin-A in vitro. In nerve terminals, conditions that promote phosphorylation enhance the interaction between parkin and endophilin-A and increase the levels of ubiquitinated proteins within PRD-associated synaptic protein complexes in wild-type but not parkin knockout brain. The findings identify a pathway for the recruitment of synaptic substrates to parkin with the potential to explain the defects in synaptic transmission observed in recessive forms of PD.

This interaction led us to analyze the frequencies of sequence variants of the CHGB gene in ALS patients and matched controls from three different countries. Of particular interest was the finding of the P413L CHGB variant present in 10% of ALS patients (n = 705) as compared to 4.5% in controls (n = 751), conferring a 2.2-fold greater relative risk to develop the disease (P < 0.0001). This effect was mainly contributed by the samples of French origin that yielded a frequency of the P413L variation at 17% in ALS (n = 289) and 5% in controls (n = 448), conferring a 3.3-fold greater risk to develop ALS. Furthermore, the P413L CHGB variant is associated with an earlier age of onset by almost a decade in both sporadic ALS and familial ALS cases. Genetic variation influencing age of onset in ALS had not previously been reported. Expression of fusion CHGB-EGFP constructs in SHSY-5Y cells revealed that the P413L variation can cause defective sorting of CHGB into secretory granules. The finding that CHGB may act as a susceptibility gene and modifier of onset in ALS is consistent with the emerging view that dysfunction of the secretory pathway may contribute to increased vulnerability of motor neurons.

After neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion, the proportion of VTA neurons expressing both mRNAs and of nAcb terminals displaying the two proteins was enhanced. To determine the fate of this dual phenotype in adults, double in situ hybridization and dual immunolabeling for TH and VGLUT2 were performed in 90-day-old rats subjected or not to the neonatal 6-OHDA lesion. Very few neurons expressed both mRNAs in the VTA and substantia nigra (SN) of P90 rats, even after neonatal 6-OHDA. Dually immunolabeled terminals were no longer found in the nAcb of normal P90 rats and were exceedingly rare in the nAcb of 6-CHDA-lesioned rats, although they had represented 28% and 37% of all TH terminals at P15. Similarly, 17% of all TH terminals in normal neostriatum and 46% in the dopamine neoinnervation of SN in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were also immunoreactive for VGLUT2 at P15, but none at P90. In these three regions, all dually labeled terminals made synapse, in contradistinction to those immunolabeled for only TH or VGLUT2 at P15. These results suggest a regression of the VGLUT2 phenotype of dopamine neurons with age, following normal development, lesion, or sprouting after injury, and a role for glutamate in the establishment of synapses by these neurons.

Age- and Gender-Related Differences in the Cortical Anatomical Network	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WHITE-MATTER MICROSTRUCTURE; BRAIN FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; CONNECTIVITY PATTERNS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DIFFUSION; CORTEX; MRI; SYSTEMS; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Neuroanatomical differences attributable to aging and gender have been well documented, and these differences may be associated with differences in behaviors and cognitive performance. However, little is known about the dynamic organization of anatomical connectivity within the cerebral cortex, which may underlie population differences in brain function. In this study, we investigated age and sex effects on the anatomical connectivity patterns of 95 normal subjects ranging in age from 19 to 85 years. Using the connectivity probability derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography, we characterized the cerebral cortex as a weighted network of connected regions. This approach captures the underlying organization of anatomical connectivity for each subject at a regional level. Advanced graph theoretical analysis revealed that the resulting cortical networks exhibited "small-world" character (i.e., efficient information transfer both at local and global scale). In particular, the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus were consistently observed as centrally connected regions, independent of age and sex. Additional analysis revealed a reduction in overall cortical connectivity with age. There were also changes in the underlying network organization that resulted in decreased local efficiency, and also a shift of regional efficiency from the parietal and occipital to frontal and temporal neocortex in older brains. In addition, women showed greater overall cortical connectivity and the underlying organization of their cortical networks was more efficient, both locally and globally. There were also distributed regional differences in efficiency between sexes. Our results provide new insights into the substrates that underlie behavioral and cognitive differences in aging and sex.

CELLULAR ORGANIZATION OF THE CENTRAL CANAL EPENDYMAL ZONE, A NICHE OF LATENT NEURAL STEM CELLS IN THE ADULT MAMMALIAN SPINAL CORD	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mouse; sub-ependymal cells; differentiation; proliferation; precursors; tanycytes	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; VASCULAR NICHE; BRAIN; PROLIFERATION; INJURY; RAT; FOREBRAIN; DIFFERENTIATION; ASTROCYTES	A stem cell's microenvironment, or "niche," is a critical regulator of its behaviour. In the adult mammalian spinal cord, central canal ependymal cells possess latent neural stem cell properties, but the ependymal cell niche has not yet been described. Here, we identify important similarities and differences between the central canal ependymal zone and the forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ), a well-characterized niche of neural stem cells. First, direct immunohistochemical comparison of the spinal cord ependymal zone and the forebrain SVZ revealed distinct patterns of neural precursor marker expression. In particular, ependymal cells in the spinal cord were found to be bordered by a previously uncharacterized sub-ependymal layer, which is relatively less elaborate than that of the SVZ and comprised of small numbers of astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitors and neurons. Cell proliferation surrounding the central canal occurs in close association with blood vessels, but unlike in the SVZ, involves mainly ependymal rather than sub-ependymal cells. These proliferating ependymal cells typically self-renew rather than produce transit-amplifying progenitors, as they generate doublets of progeny that remain within the ependymal layer and show no evidence of a lineage relationship to sub-ependymal cells. Interestingly, the dorsal pole of the central canal was found to possess a sub-population of tanycyte-like cells that express markers of both ependymal cells and neural precursors, and their presence correlates with higher numbers of dorsally proliferating ependymal cells. Together, these data identify key features of the spinal cord ependymal cell niche, and suggest that dorsal ependymal cells possess the potential for stem cell activity. This work provides a foundation for future studies aimed at understanding ependymal cell regulation under normal and pathological conditions. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the development of the auditory electrophysiological signal without addressing specific abilities such as speech or music discrimination. We were interested in the temporal and spectral domains of conventional auditory evoked potentials. We analyzed cerebral responses to auditory stimulation (broadband noises) in 40 infants and children (I month to 5 years 6 months) and 10 adults using high-density electrophysiological recording. We hypothesized that the adult auditory response has precursors that can be identified in infant and child responses. Results confirm that complex adult CAEP responses and spectral activity patterns appear after 5 years, showing decreased involvement of lower frequencies and increased involvement of higher frequencies. In addition, time-locked response to stimulus and event-related spectral pertubation across frequencies revealed alpha and beta band contributions to the CAEP of infants and toddlers before mutation to the beta and gamma band activity of the adult response. A detailed analysis of electrophysiological responses to a perceptual stimulation revealed general development patterns and developmental precursors of the adult response. (C) 2009 IBRO.

While this system has been studied extensively in animal models, far less is known about the intrinsic cardiac nervous system of humans. This study was initiated to anatomically identify neurotransmitters associated with the right atrial ganglionated plexus (RAGP) of the human heart. Biopsies of epicardial fat containing a portion of the RAGP were collected from eight patients during cardiothoracic surgery and processed for immunofluorescent detection of specific neuronal markers. Colocalization of markers was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Most intrinsic cardiac neuronal somata displayed immunoreactivity for the cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase and the nitrergic marker neuronal nitric oxide synthase. A subpopulation of intrinsic cardiac neurons also stained for noradrenergic markers. While most intrinsic cardiac neurons received cholinergic innervation evident as punctate immunostaining for the high affinity choline transporter, some lacked cholinergic inputs. Moreover, peptidergic, nitrergic, and noradrenergic nerves provided substantial innervation of intrinsic cardiac ganglia. These findings demonstrate that the human RAGP has a complex neurochemical anatomy, which includes the presence of a dual cholinergic/nitrergic phenotype for most of its neurons, the presence of noradrenergic markers in a subpopulation of neurons, and innervation by a host of neurochemically distinct nerves. The putative role of multiple neurotransmitters in controlling intrinsic cardiac neurons and mediating efferent signaling to the heart indicates the possibility of novel therapeutic targets for arrhythmia prevention.

LONG ADAPTATION REVEALS MOSTLY ATTRACTIVE SHIFTS OF ORIENTATION TUNING IN CAT PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						vision; cortical plasticity; adaptation; orientation selectivity	STRIATE CORTEX; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; SINGLE UNITS; INDUCED PLASTICITY; RECEPTIVE FIELDS; CRITICAL PERIOD; RESPONSES; NEURONS; SELECTIVITY; CELLS	In the adult brain, sensory cortical neurons undergo transient changes of their response properties following prolonged exposure to an appropriate stimulus (adaptation). In cat V1, orientation-selective cells shift their preferred orientation after being adapted to a non-preferred orientation. There are conflicting reports as to the direction of those shifts, towards (attractive) or away (repulsive) from the adapter. Moreover, the mechanisms underlying attractive shifts remain unexplained. In the present investigation we show that attractive shifts are the most frequent outcome of a 12 min adaptation. Overall, cells displaying selectivity for oblique orientations exhibit significantly larger shifts than cells tuned to cardinal orientations. In addition, cells selective to cardinal orientations had larger shift amplitudes when the absolute difference between the original preferred orientation and the adapting orientation increased. Conversely, cells tuned to oblique orientations exhibited larger shift amplitudes when this absolute orientation difference was narrower. Hence, neurons tuned to oblique contours appear to show more plasticity in response to small perturbations. Two different mechanisms appear to produce attractive and repulsive orientation shifts. Attractive shifts result from concurrent response depression on the non-adapted flank and selective response facilitation on the adapted flank of the orientation tuning curve. In contrast, repulsive shifts are caused solely by response depression on the adapted flank. We suggest that an early mechanism leads to repulsive shifts while attractive shifts engage a subsequent late facilitation. A potential role for attractive shifts may be improved stimulus discrimination around the adapting orientation. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To explore this, two monkeys (M1 and M2) were implanted with recording chambers and 3-D eye+ head search coils. Tungsten electrodes delivered trains of electrical pulses (usually 200 ms duration) to and around area LIP during head-unrestrained gaze fixations. A current of 200 mu A consistently evoked small, short-latency contralateral gaze shifts from 152 sites in M1 and 243 sites in M2 (Constantin et al., 2007). Gaze kinematics were independent of stimulus amplitude and duration, except that subsequent saccades were suppressed. The average amplitude of the evoked gaze shifts was 8.46 degrees for M1 and 8.25 degrees for M2, with average head components of only 0.36 and 0.62 degrees respectively. The head's amplitude contribution to these movements was significantly smaller than in normal gaze shifts, and did not increase with behavioral adaptation. Stimulation-evoked gaze, eye and head-movements qualitatively obeyed normal 3-D constraints (Donders' law and Listing's law), but with less precision. As in normal behavior, when the head was restrained LIP stimulation evoked eye-only saccades in Listing's plane, whereas when the head was not restrained, stimulation evoked saccades with position-dependent torsional components (driving the eye out of Listing's plane). In behavioral gaze-shifts, the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) then drives torsion back into Listing's plane, but in the absence of subsequent head movement the stimulation-induced torsion was "left hanging". This suggests that the position-dependent torsional saccade components are preprogrammed, and that the oculomotor system was expecting a head movement command to follow the saccade. These data show that, unlike SEF, FEF, and SC stimulation in nearly identical conditions, LIP stimulation falls to produce normally-coordinated eye-head gaze shifts. (C) 2009 IBRO.

MODULAR ORGANIZATION IN AREA 21a OF THE CAT REVEALED BY OPTICAL IMAGING: COMPARISON WITH THE PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						direction selectivity; orientation selectivity; spatial frequency; extra-striate cortex; ventral pathway	LATERAL SUPRASYLVIAN CORTEX; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; GLOBAL MOTION INTEGRATION; SELECTIVE PRESSURE BLOCK; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; ORIENTATION PREFERENCE; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; SINGLE NEURONS	Area 21a, located on the cat's lateral suprasylvian cortex, is considered as a higher-order cortical area. Little is known about its specific role in visual processing. In this study, the functional organization of area 21a was investigated by optical imaging of intrinsic signals and was compared to that of primary visual areas. We found a clear modular pattern for orientation selectivity in area 21a, with signal amplitude being four times lower than that in primary visual areas. There were no significant differences between the domains' characteristics, nor the tuning bandwidth, in areas of the primary visual cortex (17 and 18) and 21a. This suggests that the basic cortical structure is independent of the hierarchical level or function of one area. A uniform representation of spatial frequency was found in areas 17 and 18, as well as in area 21a. The mean preferred spatial frequency in area 21 a was 0.30 c/deg. In contrast to area 18, no direction maps were observed in area 21a whether drifting gratings or random dot kinematograms were used. This study supports the proposal that area 21a plays a pivotal role along the ventral processing stream and is mainly involved in form processing. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to its neuroprotective and pro-regenerative effects on motor neurons in vitro and in vivo, it has been shown to have analgesic effects in rat models of painful peripheral neuropathy due to vincristine and diabetes. We used a rat model of painful peripheral neuropathy produced by the chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel, to determine whether olesoxime could reverse established neuropathic pain. In addition, we determined whether giving olesoxime during the exposure to paclitaxel could prevent the development of the neuropathic pain syndrome and the accompanying degeneration of the terminal arbors of sensory fibers in the epidermis. Olesoxime significantly reduced established mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia. There was no indication of tolerance to the effect during five days of dosing and the analgesia persisted for 5-10 days after the last injection. Giving olesoxime during the exposure to paclitaxel significantly and permanently reduced the severity of mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia and significantly reduced the amount of sensory terminal arbor degeneration. Olesoxime targets mitochondrial proteins and its effects are consistent with the mitotoxicity hypothesis for paclitaxel-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy. We conclude that olesoxime may be useful clinically for both the prevention and treatment of paclitaxel-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy. (C) 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain.

In adult cat primary visual cortex, orientation-selective neurons shift their preferred orientation after being adapted to a non-preferred orientation. The direction of those shifts, towards (attractive) or away (repulsive) from the adapter depends mostly on adaptation duration. How the adaptive behavior of a neuron is related to that of its neighbors remains unclear. Results: Here we show that in most cases (75%), cells shift their preferred orientation in the same direction as their neighbors. We also found that cells shifting preferred orientation differently from their neighbors (25%) display three interesting properties: (i) larger variance of absolute shift amplitude, (ii) wider tuning bandwidth and (iii) larger range of preferred orientations among the cluster of cells. Several response properties of VI neurons depend on their location within the cortical orientation map. Our results suggest that recording sites with both attractive and repulsive shifts following adaptation may be located in close proximity to iso-orientation domain boundaries or pinwheel centers. Indeed, those regions have a more diverse orientation distribution of local inputs that could account for the three properties above. On the other hand, sites with all cells shifting their preferred orientation in the same direction could be located within iso-orientation domains. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the direction and amplitude of orientation preference shifts in VI depend on location within the orientation map. This anisotropy of adaptation-induced plasticity, comparable to that of the visual cortex itself, could have important implications for our understanding of visual adaptation at the psychophysical level.

The types of neurons presynaptic to those projection neurons remain poorly known. To address this question we used retrogradely transported adenoviral vectors encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a GFP-TTC (fragment C of the tetanus toxin) fusion protein, labeling respectively spinoparabrachial projection neurons and neurons presynaptic to them. The expression of GFP by infected neurons labeled the entire dendritic tree, enabling a more complete and quantitative morphological description of spinoparabrachial neurons than previous methods. These neurons were located in spinal LI, with dendritic arbors oriented extensively in the rostrocaudal axis (1,089.8 +/- 91.5 mu m) and displaying low spine density. In contrast, their dendrites did not extend significantly ventrally (29.2 +/- 3.5 mu m). The use of transynaptic tracer GFP-TTC revealed a population of local circuit LI neurons presynaptic to LI projection neurons. These local circuit LI neurons had distinct morphological properties, in particular significantly longer ventrally oriented dendrites (80.1 +/- 10.1 mu m). The transynaptic tracer also revealed a population of stalked cells, some being highly spiny, directly in contact with spinal projection neurons. However, stalked cells were not the only lamina II cells in direct contact with projection neurons. Intracellular injections with Lucifer yellow in parasagittal slices of fixed tissue confirmed the above observations. Overall, these experiments demonstrated that neurons projecting to the parabrachial nucleus had their dendritic branching almost exclusively in LI and had sparse dendritic spines, in contrast with local circuit neurons that often extended ventrally and could be very spiny.

Post-mortem studies tend to show that the destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra constitutes an intermediate step in a broader neurodegenerative process rather than a unique feature of Parkinson's disease, as a consistent pattern of progression would exist, originating from the medulla oblongata/pontine tegmentum. To date, neuroimaging techniques have been unable to characterize the pre-symptomatic stages of PD. However, if such a regular neurodegenerative pattern were to exist, consistent damages would be found in the brain stem, even at early stages of the disease. We recruited 23 PD patients at Hoenn and Yahr stages I to II of the disease and 18 healthy controls (HC) matched for age. T1-weighted anatomical scans were acquired (MPRAGE, 1 mm3 resolution) and analyzed using an optimized VBM protocol to detect white and grey matter volume reduction without spatial a priori. When the HC group was compared to the PD group, a single cluster exhibited statistical difference (p < 0.05 corrected for false detection rate, 4287 mm3) in the brain stem, between the pons and the medulla oblongata. The present study provides in-vivo evidence that brain stem damage may be the first identifiable stage of PD neuropathology, and that the identification of this consistent damage along with other factors could help with earlier diagnosis in the future. This damage could also explain some non-motor symptoms in PD that often precede diagnosis, such as autonomic dysfunction and sleep disorders.

Our analysis begins with a summary of family, twin, and adoption studies, which provide support for the investigation of genetic variation in suicide risk. This leads to an overview of neurochemical findings restricted to neurotransmitters and their receptors, including recent findings in whole genome gene expression studies. Next, we look at recent studies investigating lipid metabolism, cell signalling with a particular emphasis on growth factors, stress systems with a focus on the role of polyamines, and finally, glial cell pathology in suicide. We conclude with a description of new ideas to study the neurobiology of suicide, including subject-specific analysis, protein modification assessment, neuroarchitecture studies, and study design strategies to investigate the complex suicide phenotype.

Facial expression decoding as a function of emotional meaning status: ERP evidence	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						emotion; event-related potential; facial expression; grimace; N250; N400; P200	AFFECT DECISION TASK; NONVERBAL EMOTION; TIME-COURSE; FACE; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE; PROSODY	To further specify the time course of (emotional) face processing, this study compared event-related potentials elicited by faces conveying prototypical basic emotions, nonprototypical affective expressions (grimaces), and neutral faces. Results showed that prototypical and nonprototypical facial expressions could each be differentiated from neutral expressions in three different event-related potential component amplitudes (P200, early negativity, and N400), which are believed to index distinct processing stages in facial expression decoding. On the basis of the distribution of effects, our results suggest that early processing is mediated by shared neural generators for prototypical and nonprototypical facial expressions; however, later processing stages seem to engage distinct subsystems for the three facial expression types investigated according to their emotionality and meaning status.

Comparing neuronal and behavioral thresholds for spiral motion discrimination	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						discrimination; macaque; medial superior temporal; single cell recordings; single neurons; spiral motion; visual perception	AREA MST; SINGLE NEURONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; OPTIC FLOW; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; EXPANSION; RESPONSES; MT; CONTRACTION	As we move, the projection of moving objects on our retinas generates an array of velocity vectors known as optic flow. One class of optic flow is spiral motion, defined by the angle between a local vector direction and the direction of the steepest increase in local speed. By discriminating among such angles, an organism could discern between different flow patterns and effectively interact with the environment. In primates, spiral-selective neurons in medial superior temporal area are thought to provide the substrate for this ability. We found that these cells show higher discrimination thresholds than found behaviorally in humans, suggesting that when discriminating spiral motions the brain integrates information across many of these neurons to achieve its high perceptual performance.

Gender differences in carotid imaging and revascularization following stroke	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK; ACADEMY-OF-NEUROLOGY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION; ENDARTERECTOMY; STENOSIS; REGISTRY; PLAQUE; WOMEN; CARE	Background: Carotid endarterectomy is performed less often in women than in men, but it is unknown whether this reflects differences in screening rates, disease prevalence, or other factors. Methods: This was a cohort study of consecutive patients with acute stroke or TIA admitted to 11 Ontario stroke centers participating in the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network between July 1, 2003, and September 30, 2007. We compared rates of carotid imaging, the severity of carotid stenosis, and rates of carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty within 6 months of the index event in women vs men. Results: We studied 6,389 patients (48% women) with ischemic stroke or TIA. Women were less likely than men to undergo carotid imaging (81% vs 86%, p < 0.0001); however, when the analysis was limited to patients without apparent contraindications to surgery, 92% received carotid imaging, with no difference between women and men. Women were less likely than men to have severe carotid stenosis (7.4% vs 11.5%, p < 0.0001). Women were half as likely as men to undergo carotid revascularization within 6 months of the index event (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.70), but this gender difference was no longer significant in the subgroup with severe carotid stenosis (odds ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 1.15). Conclusions: Although women with ischemic stroke or TIA are less likely than men to undergo carotid screening and revascularization, this difference is largely explained by potential contraindications to surgery and by sex differences in the severity of carotid disease.

Thalamic nuclei activity in idiopathic generalized epilepsy An EEG-fMRI study	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							WAVE-DISCHARGES; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; SEIZURES; SPIKE; ACTIVATION; CORTEX	Objective: Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) are characterized by specific EEG changes including 3- to 5-Hz generalized spike-and-wave discharges. The thalamus and its cortical interactions are considered essential in the production and propagation of spike-and-wave discharges. In animal studies, corticoreticular and limbic system property changes have been observed in absence seizures and during spike-and-wave discharges and suggest the involvement of different types of thalamic nuclei. With the development of deep brain stimulation in epilepsy, the role of the thalamic nuclei needs to be clarified in human IGE. Methods: Ten patients with IGE were recorded using 3T EEG-fMRI during spike-and-wave discharges. Hemodynamic response functions were calculated for 4 regions of interest corresponding to the anterior thalamic and centromedian and parafascicular (CM-Pf) nuclei of each thalamus. The time to peak of the hemodynamic response function was compared within thalamic structures (left compared to right) and between structures (anterior thalamic compared to CM-Pf nucleus). Results: CM-Pf and anterior nucleus are both activated during GSWDs. However, the positive time to peak in the CM-Pf (4.4 +/- 2.5 s) occurred significantly earlier than in the anterior nucleus (7.6 +/- 3.2 s). Conclusions: We demonstrated in humans the involvement of the centromedian and parafascicular part of the corticoreticular system and of the anterior nucleus part of the limbic system during generalized spike-and-wave discharges. The different time courses suggest that the posterior intralaminar nuclei may be involved in epileptic discharge initiation or early propagation, while the anterior nucleus may only play a role in its maintenance. These results may help to understand the clinical effect of deep brain stimulation within thalamic nuclei in intractable idiopathic generalized epilepsy patients.

EEG-fMRI Adding to standard evaluations of patients with nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsy	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; INTRACRANIAL EEG; BOLD RESPONSES; SPIKES; MRI; SURGERY; LOCALIZATION; SUBTYPES; OUTCOMES; PET	Objective: In patients with nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), the delineation of the epileptogenic zone is difficult. Therefore these patients are often not considered for surgery due to an unclear seizure focus. The aim of this study was to investigate whether EEG-fMRI can add useful information in the preoperative evaluation of these patients. Methods: Nine nonlesional FLE patients were studied with EEG-fMRI using a 3 T scanner. Spike-related blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes were compared to the topography of the spikes and to PET and SPECT results if available. The structural MRIs were reviewed for subtle abnormalities in areas that showed BOLD responses. For operated patients, postoperative resection and histology were compared to BOLD responses. Results: Concordance between spike localization and positive BOLD response was found in 8 patients. PET and SPECT investigations corresponded with BOLD signal changes in 6 of 7 investigations. In 2 cases, reviewing the structural MRI guided by EEG-fMRI data resulted in considering a suspicious deep sulcus. Two patients were operated. In 1, the resected cortex corresponded with the suspicious sulcus and fMRI results and histology showed cortical dysplasia. In another, histology revealed an extended microdysgenesis not visible on structural MRI. EEG-fMRI had shown activation just adjacent to the resected pathologic area. Conclusions: Our study provides different types of support (topography, concordance with PET and SPECT, structural peculiarities, postoperative histology) that EEG-fMRI may help to delineate the epileptic focus in patients with nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsy, a challenging group in the preoperative evaluation.

However, the brain mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. In this study, we combined functional cerebral imaging with psychophysiological methods to explore the neural mechanisms involved in the emotional modulation of spinal nociceptive responses (RIII-reflex) and pain perception in healthy participants. Emotions induced by pleasant or unpleasant pictures modulated the responses to painful electrical stimulations in the right insula, paracentral lobule, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, and amygdala. Right insula activation covaried with the modulation of pain perception, consistent with a key role of this structure in the integration of pain signals with the ongoing emotion. In contrast, activity in the thalamus, amygdala, and several prefrontal areas was associated with the modulation of spinal reflex responses. Last, connectivity analyses suggested an involvement of prefrontal, parahippocampal, and brainstem structures in the cerebral and cerebrospinal modulation of pain by emotions. This multiplicity of mechanisms underlying the emotional modulation of pain is reflective of the strong interrelations between pain and emotions, and emphasizes the powerful effects that emotions can have on pain.

Despite many advances in neuroblastoma research, 60% of neuroblastoma, which are essentially metastatic cases, are associated with poor clinical outcome due to the lack of effectiveness of current therapeutic strategies. Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14), an enzyme involved in several steps in tumor progression, has previously been shown to be associated with poor clinical outcome for neuroblastoma. Based on our recent demonstration that MT1-MMP phosphorylation is involved in the growth of fibrosarcoma tumors, we examined the potential role of phosphorylated MT1-MMP in neuroblastoma progression. Methods: Tyrosine phosphorylated MT1-MMP was immunostained on tissue microarray samples from 55 patients with neuroblastoma detected by mass screening (known to be predominantly associated with favourable outcome), and from 234 patients with standard diagnosed neuroblastoma. In addition, the effects of a non phosphorylable version of MT1-MMP on neuroblastoma cell migration and proliferation were investigated within three-dimensional collagen matrices. Results: Although there is no correlation between the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of MT1-MMP (pMT1-MMP) and MYCN amplification or clinical stage, we observed greater phosphorylation of pMT1-MMP in standard neuroblastoma, while it is less evident in neuroblastoma from mass screening samples (P = 0.0006) or in neuroblastoma samples from patients younger than one year (P = 0.0002). In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of a non-phosphorylable version of MT1-MMP reduced MT1-MMP- mediated neuroblastoma cell migration and proliferation within a three-dimensional type I collagen matrix, suggesting a role for the phosphorylated enzyme in the invasive properties of neuroblastoma cells. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylated MT1-MMP plays an important role in neuroblastoma progression and that its expression is preferentially observed in tumor specimens from neuroblastoma patients showing poor clinical outcome.

However, the specificity of these imaging findings remains to be demonstrated. Methods: In a prospective controlled Study, we measured microglia activity using (11)C-PK11195-PET along the pyramidal tract, as defined by diffusion censor imaging, in 21 patients with first-time acute subcortical ischemia within 2 weeks of stroke. Uptake ratios (affected VS unaffected side) were determined for a set of standardized Volumes of interest along the pyramidal tracts (PT). Uptake ratios from patients in whom the PT was affected were compared with those in whom the PT was not affected. Uptake ratios were related to motor deficit and lesion size according to correlation analyses. Results: Increased uptake ratios were only found in patients in whom the PT was affected by stroke. In the affected hemisphere, uptake was increased at the level of pons, midbrain, and internal capsule, but not in the oval center. The extent of remote microglia activation was independent of infarct size or clinical measures of stroke severity. Interpretation: A specific activation of microglia was only Found in patients in whom the PT was affected by the stroke and only caudal (anterograde) to the lesion; no activation was found in the retrograde direction or in those patients in whom the PT was not affected. These findings were independent of infarct size and may represent changes secondary to early Wallerian degeneration.

Blood Lead Levels and Major Depressive Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder in US Young Adults	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							NATIONAL-COMORBIDITY-SURVEY; INORGANIC LEAD; ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; LONGITUDINAL DECLINE; DOSE BIOMARKERS; UNITED-STATES; EXPOSURE; BONE; DOPAMINE	Context: Lead is a ubiquitous neurotoxicant, and adverse cognitive and behavioral effects are well-documented in children and occupationally exposed adults but not in adults with low environmental exposure. Objective: To investigate the association of current blood lead levels with 3 common psychiatric disorders-major depression, panic, and generalized anxiety-in young adults. Design: Cross-sectional epidemiologic survey. Setting: Nationally representative sample of US adults. Participants: A total of 1987 adults aged 20 to 39 years who responded to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004). Main Outcome Measures: Twelve-month DSM-IV criteria-based diagnoses of major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: The mean (SD) blood lead level was 1.61 (1.72) mu g/dL (range, 0.3-37.3 mu g/dL) (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.0483). Increasing blood lead levels were associated with higher odds of major depression (P=.05 for trend) and panic disorder (P=.02 for trend) but not generalized anxiety disorder (P=.78 for trend) after adjustment for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education status, and poverty to income ratio. Persons with blood lead levels in the highest quintile had 2.3 times the odds of major depressive disorder (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-4.75) and 4.9 times the odds of panic disorder (1.32-18.48) as those in the lowest quintile. Cigarette smoking was associated with higher blood lead levels and outcome, but models that excluded current smokers also resulted in significantly increased odds of major depression (P=.03 for trend) and panic disorder (P=.01 for trend) with higher blood lead quintiles. Conclusions: In these young adults with low levels of lead exposure, higher blood lead levels were associated with increased odds of major depression and panic disorders. Exposure to lead at levels generally considered safe could result in adverse mental health outcomes.

In this review, we summarize recent evidences from our group and others indicating that NMO-IgG can be implicated at several levels in the immuno-pathology of NMO. NMO-IgG/anti-AQP4 antibodies may compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and consequently facilitate and enhance the perivascular inflammation characteristic of NMO. Lastly, NMO-IgG can induce astrocyte injury which may lead to the accumulation of excitatory/toxic molecules and accordingly damage oligodendrocytes and compromise myelin integrity.

The current study compares the efficacy of CBT in combination with medication and without medication. Method: CBT was administered in a consecutively referred sample of 76 people diagnosed either with Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome or chronic tic disorder. The sample was divided into a medicated and a non-medicated group. Twenty three were stabilized on medication and 53 were not receiving medication. Measures administered pre- and post-CBT in both groups included: main outcome measure of Tourette Syndrome Global Scale and measures of mood. Results: Repeated measures analysis of variance on the initial sample revealed no difference between medicated and non-medicated groups in outcome. A further analysis comparing the 23 receiving medication with 23 not receiving medication matched on baseline clinical variables also yielded no significant group differences, either in treatment outcome on main tic outcome measures or on other clinically relevant questionnaires. Discussion: CBT for tic disorders is an effective treatment administered either in combination with medication or alone. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Whether these volumetric decreases imply abnormalities in cortical thickness, surface, or cortical folding is not clear. Due to differences in cytoarchitecture, cortical gyri and sulci might be differentially affected by psychosis. Therefore, we examined differences in gyral and sulcal cortical thickness, surface, folding, and volume between a minimally treated male adolescent population with early-onset first-episode psychosis (EOP) and a healthy control group, with surface-based morphometry. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging brain scans were obtained from 49 adolescent EOP patients and 34 healthy control subjects. Subjects were younger than 18 years (age range 12 years-18 years), and EOP patients had a duration of positive symptoms of <6 months. Results: Early-onset first-episode psychosis was associated with local bilateral cortical thinning and volume deficits in both the gyri and sulci of the superior temporal cortex and the inferior, middle, medial, and superior prefrontal cortex. In the pars triangularis and opercularis cortex of patients, gyral cortical thickness was thinner, whereas sulcal thickness was not. Patients exhibited cortical thinning together with a decreased degree of cortical folding in the right superior frontal cortex. Conclusions: Cortical thinning of both gyri and sulci seem to underlie most cortical volume deficits in adolescent patients with EOP. Except for the right superior frontal region, the degree of cortical folding was normal in regions showing decreased cortical thickness, suggesting that the process of cortical thinning in adolescent patients with EOP primarily takes place after the formation of cortical folds.

Markers of neurodegeneration in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease	BRAIN			English	Article						REM sleep behaviour disorder; Parkinson's disease; prediction	SMELL IDENTIFICATION TEST; REM-SLEEP; PERSONALITY; DYSFUNCTION; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES; TRAITS	Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is an important risk factor in the development of Parkinson's disease. Numerous potential predictive markers of Parkinson's disease may present before motor symptoms emerge, but testing of these markers in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has been performed only in small studies. There has been no comparison of markers between patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Parkinson's disease, and between men and women. We evaluated an array of potential Parkinson's disease predictive markers in 159 patients; including 68 with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, 36 controls, 34 Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and 21 Parkinson's patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Compared with controls, patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder demonstrated substantial olfactory loss (P < 0.001). Olfaction was more impaired in Parkinson's disease than idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and did not differ between Parkinson's patients with, or without, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Numerous measures of motor function including the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale alternate tap, Purdue Peg Board and Timed 'Up and Go' were impaired in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P < 0.01). All of these motor measures were worse with Parkinson's disease than with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, regardless of rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder status. Autonomic symptoms and systolic blood pressure drop were impaired in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P = 0.003). Orthostatic abnormalities in Parkinson's disease were found in the group with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.001). However, Parkinson's patients without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder were not different than controls and had less impairment than those with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P = 0.004) and Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.001). Colour vision was impaired in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder compared with controls (P < 0.001). However, only Parkinson's patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder had abnormalities significantly different than controls (P < 0.001), and there were significant differences between Parkinson's patients with or without rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (P < 0.04). Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder patients had slightly increased harm avoidance scores on personality testing (P = 0.04). Other than slightly better performances among women in the Purdue Peg Board, there was no difference in any measure between men and women, suggesting similar pathogenic processes underlying rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder demonstrate abnormalities in numerous potential markers of neurodegenerative disease-these markers are heterogeneous, generally correlate with each other and occur equally in men and women. Although these abnormalities are usually intermediate between control values and Parkinson's patients, autonomic dysfunction and colour vision appear to be more linked to rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder status than Parkinson's disease,suggesting a unique pathophysiology of these abnormalities.

Many studies have shown that the white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis are associated with focal abnormalities of grey matter, but little is known about the alterations in the coordinated patterns of cortical morphology among regions in the disease. Here, we used cortical thickness measurements from structural magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the relationship between the white matter lesion load and the topological efficiency of structural cortical networks in multiple sclerosis. Network efficiency was defined using a 'small-world' network model that quantifies the effectiveness of information transfer within brain networks. In this study, we first classified patients (n = 330) into six subgroups according to their total white matter lesion loads, and identified structural brain networks for each multiple sclerosis group by thresholding the corresponding inter-regional cortical thickness correlation matrix, followed by a network efficiency analysis with graph theoretical approaches. The structural cortical networks in multiple sclerosis demonstrated efficient small-world architecture regardless of the lesion load, an organization that maximizes the information processing at a relatively low wiring cost. However, we found that the overall small-world network efficiency in multiple sclerosis was significantly disrupted in a manner proportional to the extent of total white matter lesions. Moreover, regional efficiency was also significantly decreased in specific brain regions, including the insula and precentral gyrus as well as regions of prefrontal and temporal association cortices. Finally, we showed that the lesions also altered many cortical thickness correlations in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Our results suggest that the white matter lesions in multiple sclerosis might be associated with aberrant neuronal connectivity among widely distributed brain regions, and provide structural (morphological) evidence for the notion of multiple sclerosis as a disconnection syndrome.

Reduced cerebral oxygen saturation measured by absolute cerebral oximetry during thoracic surgery correlates with postoperative complications	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						brain; cerebral saturation; surgery; thoracic; ventilation; single-lung	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; ONE-LUNG VENTILATION; MAJOR ABDOMINAL-SURGERY; CAROTID-ENDARTERECTOMY; CARDIAC-SURGERY; CANCER; CLASSIFICATION; MONITOR	Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (S(ct)O(2)) has recently been shown to decrease significantly during thoracic surgery. The present study investigates whether these desaturations are related to postoperative complications. Fifty patients undergoing thoracic surgery with a single-lung ventilation (SLV) of > 45 min duration were enrolled. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation was measured using absolute oximetry; standard clinical variables, and SOFA and Clavien scores were recorded. Correlation between minimum S(ct)O(2) during SLV and postoperative complication scores was analysed using Pearson's correlation test, chi(2) test, and logistic regression. Forty-seven patients underwent lobectomy, two patients a pneumonectomy and 1 patient a chest wall resection. Eighty-two per cent of the patients had a decrease in S(ct)O(2) of > 15% from baseline value, and 10% of the patients had a minimal absolute S(ct)O(2) value between 45% and 55%. The minimal absolute S(ct)O(2) values during SLV correlated with the Clavien score (R(2)=0.098, P=0.0201) and the non-respiratory SOFA score (R(2)=0.090, P=0.0287). By defining a threshold of S(ct)O(2)=65%, the odds ratio of having a non-respiratory organ failure was 2.37 (95% CI 1.18-4.39, P=0.043) and a complication according to the Clavien score (Clavien score > 0) was 3.19 (95% CI 1.60-6.34, P=0.0272). Thoracic surgery with SLV seemed to be associated with a significant decrease in S(ct)O(2), and minimal S(ct)O(2) values correlated positively with postoperative complications.

The UNC5 receptors mediate the repulsive response, either alone or in complex with DCC receptors. The signaling mechanisms activated by UNC5 are poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of Rho GTPases in UNC5a signaling. We found that UNC5a induced neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells in a netrin-1- and Rac1-dependent manner. UNC5a lacking its cytoplasmic tail also mediated this effect. In fibroblasts, UNC5a was able to activate RhoA and to a lower extent Rac1 and Cdc42 in response to netrin-1. Using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) intermolecular probes, we visualized the spatial and temporal activation of Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA in live N1E-115 cells expressing UNC5a during neurite outgrowth. We found that Rac1 but not Cdc42 was transiently activated at the leading edge of the cell during neurite initiation. However, at later times when well-developed neurites were formed, active RhoA was found in the cell body and at the base of the neuronal leading process in UNC5a-expressing cells. Together, these findings demonstrate that the netrin-1 receptor UNC5a is able to induce neurite outgrowth and to differentially activate RhoA and Rac1 during neurite extension in a spatial and temporal manner.

Prospective studies that incorporate early autism screening and autism diagnostic testing are needed to better delineate the sensitivity and specificity of early signs of autism in ex-premature children. Advances in neonatal MRI techniques capable of quantitative structural and functional measurements will also provide important insights into the effects of prematurity itself, and prematurity-related brain injury on the genesis of autism spectrum disorders in this population. Available evidence linking prematurity and autism spectrum disorders is reviewed in this article.

This is of particular interest because sea anemones are anthozoans, the phylogenetically basal cnidarians least changed from the common ancestors of cnidarians and bilaterian animals, and because cnidarians are considered the most basal metazoans possessing a nervous system. This analysis of the genome has yielded 20 orthologues of enzymes and nicotinic receptors associated with cholinergic function, an even larger number of genes encoding enzymes, receptors and transporters for glutamatergic (28) and GABAergic (34) transmission, and two orthologues of purinergic receptors. Numerous genes encoding enzymes (14), receptors (60) and transporters (5) for aminergic transmission were identified, along with four adenosine-like receptors and one nitric oxide synthase. Diverse neuropeptide and hormone families are also represented, mostly with genes encoding prepropeptides and receptors related to varying closeness to RFamide (17) and tachykinin (14), but also galanin (8), gonadotropin-releasing hormones and vasopressin/oxytocin (5), melanocortins (11), insulin-like peptides (5), glycoprotein hormones (7), and uniquely cnidarian peptide families (44). Surprisingly, no muscarinic acetylcholine receptors were identified and a large number of melatonin-related, but not serotonin, orthologues were found. Phylogenetic tree construction and inspection of multiple sequence alignments reveal how evolutionarily and functionally distant chemical transmitter-related proteins are from those of higher metazoans.

We selected 18 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who underwent a 2-h simultaneous EEG-fMRI and had unilateral or bilateral independent TL spikes for interindividual group analysis, in order to identify consistent blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses to TL spikes. Methods: EEG was postprocessed and spikes were visually identified. fMRI data were preprocessed with motion correction, spatial smoothing, and removal of low frequency drifts. Spike timings were used as events for fMRI statistical analysis. Four hemodynamic response functions were used to account for variability in the BOLD response. Results: Group analysis revealed common areas of BOLD activations and deactivations. The hemodynamic response function (HRF) peaking 3 s after the spike showed activation involving ipsilaterally the mesial temporal structures (presumably the hippocampus), putamen/globus pallidus, inferior insula, and superior temporal gyrus. The HRF peaking at 5 s showed activations involving ipsi- and contralaterally the superior temporal gyrus and inferior insula. Both HRFs showed bilateral posterior cingulate deactivations. Discussion: We disclosed involvement of a network of activated areas during unilateral TL spikes, including ipsilateral mesial temporal structures, basal ganglia, and bilateral neocortical temporal regions. Despite the low temporal resolution of fMRI we demonstrated that contralateral temporal involvement occurred later than ipsilateral activation. This contralateral change took place in the absence of visible EEG changes. The posterior cingulate deactivation may reflect the interconnections between this region and other limbic structures. It may also partially correspond to a suspension of the default mode network, as previously described for TL spikes.

The juvenile form has been associated with cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction, but the phenotype remains unclear. We reviewed the literature to examine the psychiatric phenotype of juvenile DM1 and performed an admixture analysis of the IQ distribution of our own patients, as we hypothesised a bimodal distribution. Two-thirds of the patients had at least one DSM-IV diagnosis, mainly attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety disorder. Two-thirds had learning disabilities comorbid with mental retardation on one hand, but also attention deficit, low cognitive speed and visual spatial impairment on the other. IQ showed a bi-modal distribution and was associated with parental transmission. The psychiatric phenotype in juvenile DM1 is complex. We distinguished two different phenotypic subtypes: one group characterised by mental retardation, severe developmental delay and maternal transmission; and another group characterised by borderline full scale IQ, subnormal development and paternal transmission.

Sensitivity was generated by substituting five amino acids in the loop C (beta 9-beta 10) region of the mouse alpha 3 subunit with the corresponding residues from the alpha 1 subunit of the muscle type receptor from Torpedo californica. To demonstrate the utility of the underlying concept, expressed alpha 3[5] subunits were characterized in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of homozygous knock-in mice, where the synaptic architecture of postsynaptic alpha 3-containing nAChR clusters could now, for the first time, be directly visualized and interrogated by live-staining with rhodamine-conjugated alpha BTX. Consistent with the postsynaptic localization of ganglionic nAChRs, the alpha BTX-labeled puncta colocalized with a marker for synaptic varicosities. Following in vivo deafferentation, these puncta persisted but with significant changes in intensity and distribution that varied with the length of the recovery period. Compound action potentials and excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded from SCG of mice homozygous for alpha 3[5] were abolished by 100 nm alpha BTX, even in an alpha 7 null background, demonstrating that synaptic throughput in the SCG is completely dependent on the alpha 3-subunit. In addition, we observed that the genetic background of various inbred and outbred mouse lines greatly affects the functional expression of alpha 3[5]-nAChRs, suggesting a powerful new approach for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor assembly and trafficking. As alpha BTX-sensitive sequences can be readily introduced into other nicotinic receptor subunits normally insensitive to alpha BTX, the findings described here should be applicable to many other receptors.

Impact of Sim1 gene dosage on the development of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						development; mice; oxytocin; paraventricular nucleus; Sim1; transcription factor; vasopressin	DORSAL VAGAL COMPLEX; NEUROHYPOPHYSEAL DIABETES-INSIPIDUS; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; OXYTOCIN-DEFICIENT MICE; FOOD-INTAKE; ANTERIOR HYPOTHALAMUS; SOLITARY TRACT; MOTOR NUCLEUS; CELL LINEAGES; FACTOR BRN-2	The bHLH-PAS transcription SIM1 is required for the development of all neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus. Mice with a loss of Sim1 die within a few days of birth, presumably because of the lack of a PVN and SON. In contrast, mice with a decrease of Sim1 survive, are hyperphagic and become obese. The mechanism by which Sim1 controls food intake remains unclear. Here we show that the development of specific PVN and SON cell types is sensitive to Sim1 gene dosage. Sim1 haploinsufficiency reduces the number of vasopressin (AVP)- and oxytocin-producing cells in the PVN by about 50 and 80%, respectively, but does not affect the development of Crh, Trh and Ss neurons. A decrease of AVP-producing cells increases the sensitivity of Sim1 heterozygous mice to chronic dehydration. Moreover, retrograde labelling showed a 70% reduction of PVN neurons projecting to the dorsal vagal complex, raising the possibility that a decrease of these axons contributes to the hyperphagia of Sim1+/- mice. Sim1 haploinsufficiency is thus associated with a decrease of several PVN/SON cell types, which has the potential of affecting distinct homeostatic processes.

In this study, a quantitative autoradiographic method using N-isopropyl-p-C-14-iodoamphetamine ([C-14]-IMP), a diffusible radioactive tracer, was evaluated for its ability to detect changes in retinal blood perfusion during hypercapnia. Findings were compared to cerebral blood flow values measured simultaneously. Hypercapnia was induced in awaken Wistar rats by inhalation of 5% or 8% CO2 in medical air for 5 min. [C-14]-IMP (100 mu Ci/kg) was injected in the femoral vein over a 30 s period and the rats were sacrificed 2 min later. Blood flow was calculated from whole-mount retinae and 20 mu m thick brain sections in discrete regions of interest by quantitative autoradiography or from digested samples of retina and brain by liquid scintillation counting. Retinal blood flow values measured with quantitative and regional autoradiography were higher in the central (108 +/- 20 ml/100 g/min) than in peripheral (84 +/- 15 ml/100 g/min) retina. These values were within the same range as cortical blood flow values (97 +/- 4 ml/100 g/min). The retinal blood flow values obtained on whole-mount retinae were validated by the sampling method. Hypercapnia significantly increased overall blood flow in the retina (24-53%) with a maximal augmentation in the peripheral region and in the brain (22-142%). The changes were stronger in the brain compared to retina (p = 0.016). These results demonstrate that retinal blood flow can be quantified using [C-14]-IMP and compared with cerebral blood flow. This technique is a powerful tool to study how retinal blood flow is regulated in different regions of the rat retina. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes may help in the difficult process of making decisions related to prostate cancer. In this review, we discuss attributes of predictive tools and systematically review those available for prostate cancer, Types of tools include probability formulas, look-up and propensity scoring tables, risk-class stratification prediction tools, classification and regression tree analysis, nomograms and artificial neural networks. Criteria to evaluate tools include discrimination, calibration, generalizability, level of complexity, decision analysis and ability to account for competing risks and conditional probabilities. The available predictive tools and their features, with a focus on nomograms, are described. While some tools are well-calibrated, few have been externally validated or directly compared with other tools. In addition, the clinical consequences of applying predictive tools need thorough assessment. Nevertheless, predictive tools can facilitate medical decision-making by showing patients tailored predictions of their outcomes with various alternatives. Additionally, accurate tools may improve clinical trial design.

Dependence of pathogen molecule-induced Toll-like receptor activation and cell function on Neu1 sialidase	GLYCOCONJUGATE JOURNAL			English	Article						Toll-like receptors; Neu1 sialidase; NF kappa B activation; pro-inflammatory cytokines; Neu1 deficient mice	EXOGENOUS ANTIGENS; DENDRITIC CELLS; T-LYMPHOCYTES; CLASS-I; COMPLEX; MACROPHAGES; GLYCOSYLATION; OSELTAMIVIR; EXPRESSION; MICE	The signaling pathways of mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLR) are well characterized, but the initial molecular mechanisms activated following ligand interactions with the receptors remain poorly defined. Here, we show a membrane controlling mechanism that is initiated by ligand binding to TLR-2, -3 and-4 to induce Neu1 sialidase activity within minutes in live primary bone marrow (BM) macrophage cells and macrophage and dendritic cell lines. Central to this process is that Neu1 and not Neu2,-3 and-4 forms a complex with TLR-2,-3 and-4 on the cell surface of na < ve macrophage cells. Neuraminidase inhibitors BCX1827, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (DANA), zanamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have a limited significant inhibition of the LPS-induced sialidase activity in live BMC-2 macrophage cells but Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) completely blocks this activity. Tamiflu inhibits LPS-induced sialidase activity in live BMC-2 cells with an IC(50) of 1.2 mu M compared to an IC(50) of 1015 mu M for its hydrolytic metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate. Tamiflu blockage of LPS-induced Neu1 sialidase activity is not affected in BMC-2 cells pretreated with anticarboxylesterase agent clopidogrel. Endotoxin LPS binding to TLR4 induces Neu1 with subsequent activation of NF kappa B and the production of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF alpha cytokines in primary and macrophage cell lines. Hypomorphic cathepsin A mice with a secondary Neu1 deficiency respond poorly to LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to the wild-type or hypomorphic cathepsin A with normal Neu1 mice. Our findings establish an unprecedented mechanism for pathogen molecule-induced TLR activation and cell function, which is critically dependent on Neu1 sialidase activity associated with TLR ligand treated live primary macrophage cells and macrophage and dendritic cell lines.
