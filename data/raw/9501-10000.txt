In parallel, they also show impaired executive and decision-making processes. However, little is known about the specific and common cognitive processes associated with NS and sensation-seeking personality traits in detoxified sober alcoholic abusers. Methods: In these present studies, we have investigated the relationships between executive functioning/central executive of working memory (pre-potent response inhibition, manipulation stored in working memory), and decision-making under uncertainty and NS/sensation-seeking traits in such alcoholics. Results: Compared with healthy controls (n = 30, mean age = 40.2), and in agreement with previous studies, alcoholics (n = 30, mean age = 40.4) showed higher levels of both NS and sensation-seeking traits. Alcoholics were also disadvantaged with respect to (a) gambling tasks, as reported previously, and (b) a poor ability to manipulate information stored in working memory and inhibit pre-potent responses. Most importantly, regression analyses and mediation analyses measures showed that poor response inhibition and decision-making were associated with high NS behaviour. In addition, impaired decision-making and manipulation of stored information in working memory were associated with a high sensation-seeking trait. Conclusions: Overall, these results support the existence of specific links between cognitive executive functioning, decision-making under uncertainty and NS/sensation-seeking personality traits in individuals with alcoholism.

J	Raja, U; Johns, G; Bilgrami, S				Raja, Usman; Johns, Gary; Bilgrami, Sabahat			Negative Consequences of Felt Violations: The Deeper the Relationship, the Stronger the Reaction	APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW-PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE			English	Article							PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT BREACH; JOB-SATISFACTION; 5-FACTOR MODEL; ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP; EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP; NATURAL-LANGUAGE; PERSONALITY; EMPLOYEES; PROMISES; BEHAVIOR	Drawing from past research suggesting that high prior commitment leads to stronger reactions to unfairness in the workplace (Brockner, Tyler, & Cooper-Schneider, 1992), we predicted that those forming relational as opposed to transactional psychological contracts would exhibit stronger detrimental effects of felt violation on job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and job performance. We also predicted a combined effect of personality and violation on these outcomes. Self- and supervisor-reported data (N = 331 dyads) collected from a variety of organisations supported our predictions. In general, relational contract terms were associated with stronger violation-outcome relationships, and transactional contract terms were associated with weaker relationships. Similarly, four of the Big Five dimensions (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, and openness to experience) moderated the violation-outcome relationships such that it was stronger for higher levels of these traits.

Serotonergic abnormalities in the unmedicated symptomatic state, however, remain to be fully characterized. Objective: To investigate brain regional 5-HT synthesis, as indexed by positron emission tomography and the alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan trapping constant (K*), in treatment-free adults meeting criteria for OCD. Design: Between-group comparison. Setting: Department of Psychiatry and Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, and Department of Psychology, McGill University Health Centre, Quebec, Canada. Participants: Twenty-one medication-free patients with OCD (15 men with a mean [SD] age of 33.2 [9.3] years and 6 women with a mean [SD] age of 35.8 [7.1] years) and 21 healthy controls matched for age and sex (15 men with a mean [SD] age of 32.9 [10.1] years and 6 women with a mean [SD] age of 36.5.5 [8.6] years). Main Outcome Measure: The alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan brain trapping constant K*, which was analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) and with proportional normalization (extent threshold of 100 voxels with a peak threshold of P <= .005). Results: Compared with healthy controls, the patients with OCD exhibited significantly greater alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan trapping in the right hippocampus and left temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 20). In the larger subsample of all men, these same differences were also evident, as well as higher K* values in the caudate nucleus. Individual differences in symptom severity correlated positively with K* values sampled from the caudate and temporal lobe of the patients with OCD, respectively. There were no regions where the patients exhibited abnormally low K* values. Volumetric analyses found no morphometric alterations that would account for the group differenees. Conclusion: The results support previous reports of greater striatal and temporal lobe activity in patients with OCD than in healthy controls and suggest that these disturbances include a serotonergic component. Previously reported glucose metabolic disturbances in OCD involving the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices, in comparison, might reflect postsynaptic changes in the serotonergic system.

The present study examined the clinical features, incidence, and risk factors for HZ in a homogeneous cohort of NMA allogeneic HSCT recipients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study assessing all patients who underwent sibling NMA HSCT at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital (Montreal) between July 2000 and December 2008. All patients received the same conditioning regimen, immunoprophylaxis, and graft-versus-host disease therapy. The diagnosis of HZ was defined clinically. Factors associated with HZ were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model. A total of 179 patients were followed for a median of 33 months (interquartile range, 21-59). HZ developed in 66 patients (37%) at a median of 8.3 months post-HSCT; the incidence rate was 175 cases/I000 person-years. The estimated cumulative HZ incidence was 27% at 1 year, 36% at 2 years, and 44% at 3 years. Thoracic dermatomes were most frequently involved (30%); dissemination occurred in 5 patients. No deaths resulted from HZ, but 23% of patients developed postherpetic neuralgia. In multivariate analysis, reactivation of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus was associated with a reduced likelihood of HZ (hazard ratio, 0.54 and 0.33, respectively). Antiviral prophylaxis or treatment for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus reactivations were protective against HZ. The incidence of HZ in our cohort of NMA HSCT recipients is similar to the incidence reported in HSCT recipients who received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Given the observed high risk, we conclude that recommendations for antiviral prophylaxis should apply, at least for the first year, to the NMA HSCT population as well.

Herein, we investigated the extent to which lentivirus infections affected mucosal integrity and intestinal permeability in conjunction with immune responses and activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. Duodenal biopsies from individuals with HIV/AIDS exhibited induction of IL-1 beta, CD3 epsilon, HLA-DRA, spliced XBP-1(Xbp-1s), and CHOP expression compared to uninfected persons (P < 0.05). Gut epithelial cells exposed to HIV-1 Vpr demonstrated elevated TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, spliced Xbp-1s, and CHOP expression (P < 0.05) together with calcium activation and disruption of epithelial cell monolayer permeability. In addition to reduced blood CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels, viral loads in the gut and plasma were high in FIV-infected animals (P < 0.05). FIV-infected animals also exhibited a failure to gain weight and increased lactulose/mannitol ratios compared with uninfected animals (P < 0.05). Proinflammatory and ER stress gene expression were activated in the ileum of FIV-infected animals (P < 0.05), accompanied by intestinal epithelial damage with loss of epithelial cells and leukocyte infiltration of the lamina propria. Lentivirus infections cause gut inflammation and ensuing damage to intestinal epithelial cells, likely through induction of ER stress pathways, resulting in disruption of gut functional integrity.-Maingat, F., Halloran, B., Acharjee, S., van Marle, G., Church, D., Gill, M.

Design: Case-control study. Setting: University teaching hospital. Patient(s): We evaluated all women with malignancy who underwent fertility preservation from the year 2003 to 2010. We compared 41 women with cancer undergoing IVF treatment with a control group of 48 age-matched women undergoing IVF for male factor infertility with the same protocol. Intervention(s): In vitro fertilization. Main Outcome Measures(s): Ovarian reserve, ovarian response to gonadotropins, number of oocytes retrieved, and oocyte maturity. Result(s): There were no significant differences in age, antral follicle count, serum FSH, total dose of gonadotropins required for stimulation, duration of stimulation, or peak E(2) levels on the day of hCG administration between women with cancer and the control group. No significant differences were observed in the number of retrieved oocytes between the malignancy and control groups. The percentages of mature oocytes in patients with hematologic malignancy (83.3%), gynecologic and intestinal malignancy (94%), and brain cancer (86%) and in the control group (82.1%) were similar, as were the fertilization rates. Conclusion(s): In young women with malignancy, ovarian reserve, response to gonadotropins, oocytes retrieved, and oocyte maturity remain unaltered by the neoplastic process. This is in contrast to the impairment of spermatogenesis before therapy in men with cancer. (Fertil Steril (R) 2011;96:122-5. (C)2011 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

However, B-cell depletion also induces systemic B-cell activating factor (BAFF), which may promote antibody production. We collected serial serum samples from a total of seven patients with NMO prior to, and following, treatment with rituximab. The samples were analyzed for anti-AQP4 antibody titer using a cell-based assay and serum BAFF levels were measured on available samples by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-AQP4 antibody levels decreased after 4 weeks to 12 weeks from the first injection of rituximab, but they increased transiently in several patients at 2 weeks after the first injection, in association with a parallel increase in serum BAFF levels. Although anti-AQP4 antibodies appear to decrease overall following rituximab treatment, our findings raise concern over the potential for an early BAFF-mediated worsening of patients with NMO receiving rituximab.

Colored context cues can facilitate the ability to learn and to switch between multiple dynamical force fields. J Neurophysiol 106: 163-183, 2011. First published April 13, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00869.2010.-We tested the efficacy of color context cues during adaptation to dynamic force fields. Four groups of human subjects performed elbow flexion/extension movements to move a cursor between targets on a monitor while encountering a resistive (Vr) or assistive (Va) viscous force field. They performed two training sets of 256 trials daily, for 10 days. The monitor background color changed (red, green) every four successful trials but provided different degrees of force field context information to each group. For the irrelevant-cue groups, the color changed every four trials, but one group encountered only the Va field and the other only the Vr field. For the reliable-cue group, the force field alternated between Va and Vr each time the monitor changed color (Vr, red; Va, green). For the unreliable-cue group, the force field changed between Va and Vr pseudorandomly at each color change. All subjects made increasingly stereotyped movements over 10 training days. Reliable-cue subjects typically learned the association between color cues and fields and began to make predictive changes in motor output at each color change during the first day. Their performance continued to improve over the remaining days. Unreliable-cue subjects also improved their performance across training days but developed a strategy of probing the nature of the field at each color change by emitting a default motor response and then adjusting their motor output in subsequent trials. These findings show that subjects can extract explicit and implicit information from color context cues during force field adaptation.

Preclinical Pharmacology of AZD2327: A Highly Selective Agonist of the delta-Opioid Receptor	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							MESSENGER-RNA; MU-RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VITRO; NEURONS; POTENT; SNC80; DISORDERS; BW373U86; MODELS	In the present article, we summarize the preclinical pharmacology of 4-{(R)-(3-aminophenyl)[4-(4-fluorobenzyl)-piperazin-1-yl]methyl}-N, N-diethylbenzamide (AZD2327), a highly potent and selective agonist of the delta-opioid receptor. AZD2327 binds with sub-nanomolar affinity to the human opioid receptor (K(i) = 0.49 and 0.75 nM at the C27 and F27 isoforms, respectively) and is highly selective (>1000-fold) over the human mu- and kappa-opioid receptor subtypes as well as >130 other receptors and channels. In functional assays, AZD2327 shows full agonism at human delta-opioid receptors ([(35)S]GTP gamma EC(50) = 24 and 9.2 nM at C27 and F27 isoforms, respectively) and also at the rat and mouse delta-opioid receptors. AZD2327 is active in a wide range of models predictive of anxiolytic activity, including a modified Geller-Seifter conflict test and social interaction test, as well as in antidepressant models, including learned helplessness. In animals implanted with microdialysis probes and then given an acute stressor by pairing electric shock delivery with a flashing light, there is an increase in norepinephrine release into the prefrontal cortex associated with this acute anxiety state. Both the benzodiazepine anxiolytic standard diazepam and AZD2327 blocked this norepinephrine release equally well, and there was no evidence of tolerance to these effects of AZD2327. Overall, these data support the role of the delta-opioid receptor in the regulation of mood, and data suggest that AZD2327 may possess unique antidepressant and anxiolytic activities that could make a novel contribution to the pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders.

Mutations in the MMACHC gene (cblC complementation group) disrupt processing of the upper-axial ligand of newly internalized cobalamins, leading to functional deficiency of the vitamin. Patients with cblC disease present with both hyperhomocysteinemia and methylmalonic acidemia, cognitive dysfunction, and megaloblastic anemia. In the present study we show that cultured skin fibroblasts from cblC patients export increased levels of both homocysteine and methylmalonic acid compared to control skin fibroblasts, and that they also have decreased levels of total intracellular folates. This is consistent with the clinical phenotype of functional cobalamin deficiency in vivo. The protein changes that accompany human functional Cbl deficiency are unknown. The proteome of control and cblC fibroblasts was quantitatively examined by two dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS). Major changes were observed in the expression levels of proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization and assembly, the neurological system and cell signaling. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins demonstrated strong associations with neurological disorders, muscular and skeletal disorders, and cardiovascular diseases in the cblC mutant cell lines. Supplementation of the cell cultures with hydroxocobalamin did not restore the cblC proteome to the patterns of expression observed in control cells. These results concur with the observed phenotype of patients with the cblC disorder and their sometimes poor response to treatment with hydroxocobalamin. Our findings could be valuable for designing alternative therapies to alleviate the clinical manifestation of the cblC disorder, as some of the protein changes detected in our study are common hallmarks of known pathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as muscular dystrophies.

There has been considerable debate in the field as to whether the inflammatory response is good or bad for tissue protection and repair. Recent studies on macrophage polarization in non-neural tissues have shed much light on their changing functional states. In the context of this literature, we discuss the activation of macrophages and microglia following spinal cord injury, and their effects on repair. Harnessing their anti-inflammatory properties could pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for spinal cord trauma.

Neuropsychological tests, manual hippocampal volume, automated regional volume and regional cortical thickness measures were performed in 120 AD patients, 120 MCI subjects, and 111 controls. The regional cortical thickness and volumes in MCI subjects were significantly decreased in limbic/paralimbic areas and temporal lobe compared to controls. Atrophy was much more extensive in the AD patients compared to MCI subjects and controls. The combination of neuropsychological tests and volumes revealed the highest accuracy (82% AD vs. MCI; 94% AD vs. control; 83% MCI vs. control). Adding regional cortical thicknesses into the discriminate analysis did not improve accuracy. We conclude that regional cortical thickness and volume measures provide a panoramic view of brain atrophy in AD and MCI subjects. A combination of neuropsychological tests and regional volumes are important when discriminating AD from healthy controls and MCI. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A clinical allostatic load index is associated with burnout symptoms and hypocortisolemic profiles in healthy workers	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Allostatic load; Burnout; Chronic stress; Cortisol; alpha-Amylase; Trier Social Stress Test	CHRONIC-FATIGUE-SYNDROME; CORTISOL AWAKENING RESPONSE; SOCIAL STRESS TEST; SALIVARY CORTISOL; JOB STRESS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PERCEIVED STRESS; DIURNAL CYCLE; DEPRESSION; MEMORY	Chronic stress causes stress hormones to strain many biological systems in a process referred to as allostatic load (AL) that is measurable using an index of biomarkers. While the AL framework has been successfully applied in studies of workplace stress, few studies have investigated burnout, a debilitating condition sometimes characterized by blunted stress hormone levels. Using an AL index based on clinical norms, we hypothesized that higher AL indices would be associated with increased chronic stress, burnout symptoms, as well as hypoactive diurnal and reactive stress hormone levels. Fifteen neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic, and cardiovascular biomarkers were collected for 30 healthy participants from various professions and values were transformed into an AL index using clinical norms. Stress reactivity was assessed for salivary cortisol and a-amylase levels in response to the Trier Social Stress Test. Diurnal cortisol was measured at five time points (awakening, 30 min after awakening, 14:00 h, 16:00 h, and before bedtime) over two working days. We also administered questionnaires of chronic stress, burnout, and depression. Our results demonstrate that increased AL is associated with increased chronic stress, burnout symptoms, but not depressive symptoms. The High AL group demonstrated lower morning and stress reactive cortisol levels in comparison to the Low AL group, but no significant effects were detected for salivary alpha-amylase. These findings provide preliminary support for the utility of a new clinical AL index that is sensitive to physiological recalibrations intermittently observed in burnout research.

BE values can be used as a screening tool for the evaluation of population-based biomonitoring data in the context of existing risk assessments. This study reviews health based risk assessments and exposure guidance values for 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenylether (PBDE-99) from Health Canada and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Toxicokinetic data from laboratory animals and humans are reviewed. A BE value corresponding to the US EPA RID is derived here for PBDE-99 based on the assumption of chronic steady-state exposure, distribution into body lipids, and a previously-estimated first-order half-life of elimination of 1040 days. The steady-state lipid-adjusted BE(RfD) is 520 ng/g lipid. Sources of uncertainty relating to the underlying toxicokinetic and toxicologic database for PBDE-99 and the simultaneous exposure to multiple PBDE congeners are discussed. The BE(RfD) value may be used as a screening tool for evaluation of population biomonitoring data for PBDE-99 in the context of the existing US EPA risk assessment and can assist in prioritization of the potential need for additional risk assessment efforts for PBDE-99 relative to other chemicals.

Biomonitoring Equivalents for deltamethrin	REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Biomonitoring Equivalents; Deltamethrin; Risk assessment; Toxicokinetics	SUBURBAN CHILDRENS EXPOSURE; HUMAN DOSE-EXCRETION; IN-VITRO METABOLISM; PYRETHROID INSECTICIDES; URINE SAMPLES; CYTOCHROME-P450 ISOFORMS; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; ACUTE NEUROTOXICITY; PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; EXPERT WORKSHOP	Measured concentrations of chemicals in blood or urine in biomonitoring studies provide an integrated reflection of exposures to chemicals via multiple routes and pathways. The potential significance of the measured concentrations of chemicals in the context of existing toxicology data and risk assessments can be assessed if chemical-specific quantitative screening criteria are available. This work presents the derivation of Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) for deltamethrin, a synthetic Type II pyrethroid. BEs are estimates of biomarker concentrations that are consistent with risk assessment-based exposure guidance values such as reference doses or acceptable daily intakes. BE values were derived for deltamethrin based on two biomarkers: deltamethrin in plasma and 3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (DBCA), a specific metabolite, in urine. BE values for deltamethrin in plasma were based on extrapolation from measured deltamethrin concentrations in plasma in rats under conditions consistent with the Point of Departure in the critical study underlying the USEPA RfD. BE values for DBCA in urine were derived based on pharmacokinetic data from a study in human volunteers on the urinary excretion of deltamethrin and metabolites. BE values for deltamethrin in plasma corresponding to the USEPA RfD for adults and children are 20 and 2 mu g/L, respectively. BE values for DBCA in urine corresponding to the adult and child-specific RfDs are 50 and 7 mu g/L, respectively. The urinary BE value corresponding to the ADI established by the European Commission and the Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues is 60 mu g/L (as DBCA in urine). These values can be used to screen biomonitoring data in the context of current risk assessments for detlamethrin. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cortical thickness analysis and voxel-based morphometry were analyzed in 47 8-year-old boys (22 DBDs with and without CD and/or ODD and 25 healthy controls) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging brain scans. DBD symptoms were assessed using the Dominic-R. In DBD subjects relative to controls, we found (1) a decreased overall mean cortical thickness; (2) thinning of the cingulate, prefrontal and insular cortices; and (3) decreased gray matter density (GMd) in the same brain regions. We also found that scores on the Dominic-R were negatively correlated with GMd in the prefrontal and precuneus/superior temporal regions. There was a subdiagnostic main effect for CD, related to thinning of the middle/medial frontal, and for ODD in the left rectal/orbitofrontal. Findings suggest that thinning and decreased GMd of the insula disorganizes prefrontal circuits, diminishing the inhibitory influence of the prefrontal cortex on anger, aggression, cruelty, and impulsivity, and increasing a person's likelihood of aggressive behavior. These findings have implications for pathophysiologic models of the DBDs, their diagnostic classification system, and for designing more effective intervention programs. Aggr.

The objectives of our study were to describe the demographic characteristics of spinal cord tumors (SCT) in children less than 3 years of age at diagnosis and to review their treatment and outcome. A national retrospective chart review was conducted on patients under the age of 3 years diagnosed with a primary tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) between 1990 and 2005 across Canada. Inclusion criteria were: age a parts per thousand currency sign3 years, histologic confirmation of the diagnosis, and residency in Canada. A centralized database was created and information regarding SCT was extracted. Twenty-five of five hundred seventy-nine patients (4.3%) in the data bank had a SCT. The majority of tumors were low-grade astrocytomas (14/25). Leptomeningeal dissemination based on neuroradiologic imaging and/or cerebrospinal fluid cytology was present in five (20%) patients. The majority of patients underwent an incomplete surgical resection (52%). Most patients (64%) did not receive postoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Seventy-two percent (18/25) developed recurrent/progression of disease. Overall 2- and 5-year survival for low- and high-grade malignancies was 93 +/- 6.4% and 37.5 +/- 17.1% respectively. Significant predictors of survival included mean duration of symptoms prior to initial diagnosis and recurrence/progression of disease. Relapse/progression of disease in infant SCT is frequent. Prolonged survival of low-grade tumors is possible with further therapy; however, the prognosis of high-grade malignancies remains poor.

Contribution of VANGL2 mutations to isolated neural tube defects	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						neural tube defects; planar cell polarity; VANGL2	LOOP-TAIL; MEMBERS; FAMILY; MICE	Vangl2 was identified as the gene defective in the Looptail (Lp) mouse model for neural tube defects (NTDs). This gene forms part of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, also called the non-canonical Frizzled/Dishevelled pathway, which mediates the morphogenetic process of convergent extension essential for proper gastrulation and neural tube formation in vertebrates. Genetic defects in PCP signaling have strongly been associated with NTDs in mouse models. To assess the role of VANGL2 in the complex etiology of NTDs in humans, we resequenced this gene in a large multi-ethnic cohort of 673 familial and sporadic NTD patients, including 453 open spina bifida and 202 closed spinal NTD cases. Six novel rare missense mutations were identified in seven patients, five of which were affected with closed spinal NTDs. This suggests that VANGL2 mutations may predispose to NTDs in approximately 2.5% of closed spinal NTDs (5 in 202), at a frequency that is significantly different from that of 0.4% (2 in 453) detected in open spina bifida patients (p = 0.027). Our findings strongly implicate VANGL2 in the genetic causation of spinal NTDs in a subset of patients and provide additional evidence for a pathogenic role of PCP signaling in these malformations.

There is reliable data showing that serotonin disturbances are involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. However, in the case of FM, results published so far are less consistent. Therefore, the current cross-sectional study sought to measure plasma serotonin levels in FM patients, MDD patients, and healthy controls (HC). Methods: Twenty-nine FM patients, 17 MDD patients, and 57 HC were recruited who did not differ in terms of age, sex, and the presence or absence of a regular menstrual cycle. Plasma samples were analysed with mass spectrometry. Results: Serotonin levels were decreased in MDD patients, relative to FM patients and HC. Post hoc analyses showed that serotonin levels were decreased in FM patients taking antidepressants, relative to HC, but not in drug-free FM patients. Moreover, serotonin levels were negatively correlated with mood symptoms across groups. Discussion: Our results further confirm that MDD is associated with decreased serotonin levels, but that serotonin levels are not altered in FM per se, and suggest that 5-Hydroxytryptamine is related to mood symptoms in these patient groups. Our results also suggest that the taking of antidepressant is a major confound to consider when studying serotonin functioning in FM. The long-term use of antidepressants in FM may lead to serotonin depletion. Conversely, serotonin depletion may be before the taking of antidepressants in FM.

The unique feature of the system is its ability, when needed, to improve the initial patient-to-preoperative image alignment based on the intraoperative ultrasound data. Parts of IBIS Neuronav source code are now publicly available on-line. Methods Four aspects of the system are characterized in this paper: the ultrasound probe calibration, the temporal calibration, the patient-to-image registration and the MRI-ultrasound registration. In order to characterize its real clinical precision and accuracy, the system was tested in a series of adult brain tumor cases. Results Three metrics were computed to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the ultrasound calibration. 1) Reproducibility: 1.77mm and 1.65mm for the bottom corners of the ultrasound image, 2) point reconstruction precision 0.62-0.90mm: and 3) point reconstruction accuracy: 0.49-0.74mm. The temporal calibration error was estimated to be 0.82 ms. The mean fiducial registration error (FRE) of the homologous-point-based patient-to-MRI registration for our clinical data is 4.9 +/- 1.1mm. After the skin landmark-based registration, the mean misalignment between the ultrasound and MR images in the tumor region is 6.1 +/- 3.4 mm. Conclusions The components and functionality of a new prototype system are described and its precision and accuracy evaluated. It was found to have an accuracy similar to other comparable systems in the literature.	[Mercier, Laurence; Kochanowska, Anna; Drouin, Simon; Yan, Charles X. B.; Chen, Sean Jy-Shyang; Collins, D.

None of the other genes in the C18QTL3-residing interval is known to affect BP. The identification of C18QTL3 might uncover a brand new gene that could prosper into a novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic target for essential hypertension, if neither Adrb2 nor Nedd4l could be upheld as candidate genes. Methods Congenic fine resolution was combined with gene analyses. Results The gene encoding alpha-kinase 2 (Alpk2) contains a three base-pair deletion and multiple nonconserved mutations in its coding region in Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats. In contrast, the gastrin-releasing peptide gene (Grp) possesses two nonconserved mutations, designated as single nucleotide polymorphisms 1 and 2 (i.e. SNP1 and SNP2), but could not be supported as a candidate gene because the C18S.L14 congenic strain displayed a homozygous DSS genotype at both SNP1 and SNP2. Furthermore, Adrb2 and Nedd4l could not account for the BP-diminishing effect of Lewis alleles in C18S.L14, as their DSS alleles bear functionally identical domains as those of Lewis, and no evidence of differential expression and splicing was evident. No significant nucleotide variations were found in 13 other genes closely linked to Alpk2. Conclusion Alpk2 emerged as a strong candidate gene for C18QTL3. The present study is the first to implicate Alpk2 in the genetics of polygenic hypertension and paves the way for novel gene discovery.

PCSK9 reduces the protein levels of the LDL receptor in mouse brain during development and after ischemic stroke	JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH			English	Article						low density lipoprotein; apolipoprotein E; hypercholesterolemia; brain development; neurogenesis	DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN-RECEPTOR; AUTOSOMAL-DOMINANT HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; PROPROTEIN CONVERTASES; LIVER-REGENERATION; PLASMA-CHOLESTEROL; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; TRANSPORT PROTEIN	Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a major role in cholesterol homeostasis through enhanced degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in liver. As novel inhibitors/silencers of PCSK9 are now being tested in clinical trials to treat hypercholesterolemia, it is crucial to define the physiological consequences of the lack of PCSK9 in various organs. LDLR regulation by PCSK9 has not been extensively described during mouse brain development and injury. Herein, we show that PCSK9 and LDLR are co-expressed in mouse brain during development and at adulthood. Although the protein levels of LDLR and apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the adult brain of Pcsk9(-/-) mice are similar to those of wild-type (WT) mice, LDLR levels increased and were accompanied by a reduction of apoE levels during development. This suggests that the upregulation of LDLR protein levels in Pcsk9(-/-) mice enhances apoE degradation. Upon ischemic stroke, PCSK9 was expressed in the dentate gyrus between 24 h and 72 h following brain reperfusion. Although mouse behavior and lesion volume were similar, LDLR protein levels dropped similar to 2-fold less in the Pcsk9(-/-) -lesioned hippocampus, without affecting apoE levels and neurogenesis. Thus, PCSK9 downregulates LDLR levels during brain development and following transient ischemic stroke in adult mice.-Rousselet, E., J. Marcinkiewicz, J. Kriz, A. Zhou, M. E. Hatten, A. Prat, and N. G. Seidah. PCSK9 reduces the protein levels of the LDL receptor in mouse brain during development and after ischemic stroke. J. Lipid Res. 2011. 52: 1383-1391.

Human coronaviruses are recognized to cause up to a third of common colds and are suspected to be involved in enteric and neurologic diseases. Coronavirus replication involves the generation of nested subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) with a common capped 5' leader sequence. The translation of most of the sgmRNAs is thought to be cap dependent and displays a requirement for eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), a heterotrimeric complex needed for the recruitment of 40S ribosomes. We recently reported on an ultrahigh-throughput screen to discover compounds that inhibit eIF4F activity by blocking the interaction of two of its subunits (R. Cencic et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 108: 1046-1051, 2011). Herein we describe a molecule from this screen that prevents the interaction between eIF4E (the cap-binding protein) and eIF4G (a large scaffolding protein), inhibiting cap-dependent translation. This inhibitor significantly decreased human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) replication, reducing the percentage of infected cells and intra-and extracellular infectious virus titers. Our results support the strategy of targeting the eIF4F complex to block coronavirus infection.

Significant remodeling of the peripheral nervous system may contribute to the pain; however, the changes and the factors that drive them have not been well described. In this study, a partial injury of the mental nerve of the rat, a purely sensory branch of the trigeminal nerve, resulted in prolonged mechanical allodynia in the lower lip skin persisting up to 4 months. Although nonpeptidergic, P2X3-immunoreactive (IR) C fibers displayed a transient decrease in density of innervation in the skin; they returned to sham levels by 4 weeks after lesioning. Ectopic sympathetic (as detected by anti-dopamine-beta-hydroxylase antibodies) and parasympathetic (as detected by antibodies against the vesicular acetylcholine transporter) fibers in the upper dermis were apparent early on the following lesion (2 weeks), in close apposition with regenerating nonpeptidergic fibers. Meanwhile, the glial cell line-derived growth factor (GDNF) showed a quick upregulation in the skin after nerve lesioning, with levels peaking at 4 weeks. This suggests that an excess of GDNF in the skin drives the nonpeptidergic C-fiber regeneration and parasympathetic fiber sprouting in the upper dermis, and could be an important mechanism in trigeminal neuropathic pain. This article provides an in-depth description of the changes in nonpeptidergic fibers in the skin after nerve lesioning, and measures, for the first time, GDNF protein levels in the skin after a nerve lesion, providing strong evidence for the role of GDNF in modulating innervation of the nonpeptidergic and parasympathetic fibers in the skin after injury.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that self-pain may be facilitated by the vicarious priming of neural systems underlying pain perception. Pictures illustrating painful agents applied to the hand or the foot (sensory information), or painful facial expressions (emotional information) were shown to 43 participants to test the effects of vicarious pain on the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) of the lower limb and pain intensity and unpleasantness produced by transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied over the sural nerve. Results confirmed the expected priming effects of vicarious pain on spinal and perceptual processes. However, for comparable pain intensity and arousal evoked by the pain pictures, the facilitation of the NFR and the self-pain unpleasantness measurements was more robust in response to pictures depicting pain sensory compared to emotional information. Furthermore, the facilitation of the NFR by pain pictures was positively correlated with the empathy trait of the observer. In contrast, the change in perceived shock-pain intensity was negatively correlated with empathic traits. This dissociation implies that low-level vicarious priming processes underlying pain facilitation may be downregulated at higher pain-processing stages in individuals reporting higher levels of empathy. We speculate that this process contributes to reducing self-other assimilation and is necessary to adopt higher-order empathic responses and altruistic behaviors.

Given importance of appropriate social functioning to everyday interactions, as well as psychological well-being, accurately identifying and documenting such functions constitute a critical undertaking for both researchers and clinicians in psychology and related health professions. This review aimed to identify available social function assessment tools for children and adolescents using a comprehensive search method. Eighty-six measures were identified. Information on the assessment tools including the theoretical model they are based on, age range, sample used in development, and psychometric information are described. Results will aid researchers, psychologists and other health professionals in the selection of an appropriate tool to assess social function. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Crowe, L.

This contrasts with the smaller N400 amplitudes observed in more- than in less-deluded schizophrenia patients. Here, we hypothesize that these smaller N400 amplitudes were related to the paranoid feelings patients had during the ERP recording. We thus induced this type of feelings in healthy subjects. Delusional-like ideation was assessed with the schizotypal personality questionnaire. Thirty-four healthy subjects completed a semantic categorization task. Paranoid feelings were significantly enhanced by the induction. In these conditions, greater delusional-like ideation scores were associated with smaller N400 amplitudes and larger late positive components. Controlling for the two other schizotypal factors strengthened these results. These findings may help us understand why delusions persist.	[Debruille, J.

Therefore, musical training is an excellent model to study multimodal brain plasticity. Indeed, we have previously shown that short-term piano practice increase the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) response to melodic material in novice players. Here we investigate the impact of piano training using a rhythmic-focused exercise on responses to rhythmic musical material. Musical training with non musicians was conducted over a period of two weeks. One group (sensorimotor-auditory, SA) learned to play a piano sequence with a distinct musical rhythm, another group (auditory, A) listened to, and evaluated the rhythmic accuracy of the performances of the SA-group. Training-induced cortical plasticity was evaluated using MEG, comparing the mismatch negativity (MMN) in response to occasional rhythmic deviants in a repeating rhythm pattern before and after training. The SA-group showed a significantly greater enlargement of MMN and P2 to deviants after training compared to the A-group. The training-induced increase of the rhythm MMN was bilaterally expressed in contrast to our previous finding where the MMN for deviants in the pitch domain showed a larger right than left increase. The results indicate that when auditory experience is strictly controlled during training, involvement of the sensorimotor system and perhaps increased attentional recources that are needed in producing rhythms lead to more robust plastic changes in the auditory cortex compared to when rhythms are simply attended to in the auditory domain in the absence of motor production.

J	Bella, SD; Palmer, C				Bella, Simone Dalla; Palmer, Caroline			Rate Effects on Timing, Key Velocity, and Finger Kinematics in Piano Performance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERSON IDENTIFICATION; SEQUENCE PRODUCTION; BIOLOGICAL MOTION; MUSIC PERFORMANCE; STRING VIBRATIONS; FORCE PRODUCTION; ACCURACY; TOUCH; CUES; HAND	We examined the effect of rate on finger kinematics in goal-directed actions of pianists. In addition, we evaluated whether movement kinematics can be treated as an indicator of personal identity. Pianists' finger movements were recorded with a motion capture system while they performed melodies from memory at different rates. Pianists' peak finger heights above the keys preceding keystrokes increased as tempo increased, and were attained about one tone before keypress. These rate effects were not simply due to a strategy to increase key velocity (associated with tone intensity) of the corresponding keystroke. Greater finger heights may compensate via greater tactile feedback for a speed-accuracy tradeoff that underlies the tendency toward larger temporal variability at faster tempi. This would allow pianists to maintain high temporal accuracy when playing at fast rates. In addition, finger velocity and accelerations as pianists' fingers approached keys were sufficiently unique to allow pianists' identification with a neural-network classifier. Classification success was higher in pianists with more extensive musical training. Pianists' movement "signatures'' may reflect unique goal-directed movement kinematic patterns, leading to individualistic sound.

Efficient bubbles for visual categorization tasks	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Classification images; Vision; Facial expression categorization; Bubbles; Adaptive sampling; Reinforcement learning; Temporal difference learning	CLASSIFICATION IMAGES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; INFORMATION; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; REVEAL; DAMAGE	Bubbles is a classification image technique that randomly samples visual information from input stimuli to derive the diagnostic features that observers use in visual categorization tasks. To reach statistical significance, Bubbles performs an exhaustive and repetitive search in the stimulus space. To reduce the search trials, we developed an adaptive method that uses reinforcement learning techniques to optimize sampling by exploiting the observer's history of categorization. We compared the performance of the original and the adaptive Bubbles algorithms in a model observer and eight human adults who all resolved the same visual categorization task (i.e., five facial expressions of emotion). We demonstrate the feasibility of a substantial reduction (by a factor of similar to 2) in the number of search trials required to locate the same diagnostic features with the adaptive method, but only when the observer reaches a performance threshold of 50% correct for each expression category. When this threshold is not reached, both the original and adaptive algorithms converge in the same number of trials. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interestingly, however, individuals differ substantially in their level of expressiveness, ranging from high expressive to stoic individuals. Here, we investigate which brain mechanisms underlie the regulation of facial expressiveness to acute pain. Facial responses, pain ratings, and brain activity (BOLD-fMRI) evoked by noxious heat and warm (control) stimuli were recorded in 34 human volunteers with different degrees of facial expressiveness. Within-subject and between-subject variations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses were examined specifically in relation to facial responses. Pain expression was inversely related to frontostriatal activity, consistent with a role in downregulating facial displays. More detailed analyses of the peak activity in medial prefrontal cortex revealed negative BOLD responses to thermal stimuli, an effect generally associated with the default mode network. Given that this negative BOLD response was weaker in low expressive individuals during pain, it could reflect stronger engagement in, or reduced disengagement from, self-reflective processes in stoic individuals. The occurrence of facial expressions during pain was coupled with stronger primary motor activity in the face area and-interestingly-in areas involved in pain processing. In conclusion, these results indicate that spontaneous pain expression reflects activity within nociceptive pathways while stoicism involves the active suppression of expression, a manifestation of learned display rules governing emotional communication and possibly related to an increased self-reflective or introspective focus.

Astrocytes Display Complex and Localized Calcium Responses to Single-Neuron Stimulation in the Hippocampus	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SEMLIKI-FOREST-VIRUS; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; IN-SITU; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; SLICE CULTURES; D-SERINE; TRANSMITTER RELEASE	Astrocytes show a complex structural and physiological interplay with neurons and respond to neuronal activation in vitro and in vivo with intracellular calcium elevations. These calcium changes enable astrocytes to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity through various mechanisms. However, the response pattern of astrocytes to single neuronal depolarization events still remains unresolved. This information is critical for fully understanding the coordinated network of neuron-glial signaling in the brain. To address this, we developed a system to map astrocyte calcium responses along apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices using single-neuron stimulation with channelrhodopsin-2. This technique allowed selective neuronal depolarization without invasive manipulations known to alter calcium levels in astrocytes. Light-evoked neuronal depolarization was elicited and calcium events in surrounding astrocytes were monitored using the calcium-sensitive dye Calcium Orange. Stimulation of single neurons caused calcium responses in populations of astrocytes along the apical axis of CA1 cell dendrites. Calcium responses included single events that were synchronized with neuronal stimulation and poststimulus changes in calcium event frequency, both of which were modulated by glutamatergic and purinergic signaling. Individual astrocytes near CA1 cells showed low ability to respond to repeated neuronal depolarization events. However, the response of the surrounding astrocyte population was remarkably accurate. Interestingly, the reliability of responses was graded with respect to astrocyte location along the CA1 cell dendrite, with astrocytes residing in the primary dendrite subregion being most responsive. This study provides a new perspective on the dynamic response property of astrocyte ensembles to neuronal activity.	[Bernardinelli, Yann; Salmon, Chris; Jones, Emma V.; Farmer, W.

Cerebrovascular hemodynamic correlates of aging in the Lou/c rat: A model of healthy aging	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Intrinsic optical imaging; Cerebral blood flow; Somatosensory cortex; Aging; Sex; LOU rat	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; OXYGEN-METABOLISM; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LASER SPECKLE; OLDER-ADULTS; BOLD FMRI	The LOU/c rat is an inbred strain considered a model of healthy aging. It exhibits a longer free disease lifespan and a low adiposity throughout life. While this animal model has been shown to maintain eating behavior and neuroendocrine, metabolic and cognitive functions with age, no study has yet investigated vascular correlates in this model of healthy aging. In the present work, multispectral optical imaging was used to investigate the hemodynamic response in the somatosensory cortex of LOU/c rats following forepaw stimulation in three age groups, 4, 24 and 40 months. Results indicate reduced hemodynamic responses in the contralateral somatosensory cortex between young (4 months) and older groups following stimulation. This decrease was associated with an increase in the spatial extent of activation. The ipsilateral response did not change with aging leading to decreased laterality. Estimations of the relative change in the local cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen during stimulation based on multimodal data showed no significant change with age. The exponent describing the relation between blood volume and blood flow changes, Grubb's parameter, did display a significant change with age which may suggest vessel compliance modifications. This work finds its relevance in recent findings underlying the importance of vascular changes with aging and its impact on neurodegenerative disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Morphology-based hypothesis testing in discrete random fields: A non-parametric method to address the multiple-comparison problem in neuroimaging	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; PERMUTATION; INFERENCE; INTENSITY; IMAGES; EXTENT; BRAIN; VOXEL	A new method for detecting activations in random fields, which may be useful for addressing the issue of multiple comparisons in neuroimaging, is presented. This method is based on some constructs of mathematical morphology specifically, morphological erosions and dilations that enable the detection of active regions in random fields possessing moderate activation levels and relatively large spatial extension, which may not be detected by the standard methods that control the family-wise error rate. The method presented here permits an appropriate control of the false positive errors, without having to adjust any threshold values, other than the significance level. The method is easily adapted to permutation-based procedures (with the usual restrictions), and therefore does not require strong assumptions about the distribution and spatio-temporal correlation structure of the data. Some examples of applications to synthetic data, including realistic fMRI simulations, as well as to real fMRI and electroencephalographic data are presented, illustrating the power of the presented technique. Comparisons with other methods that combine voxel intensity and cluster size, as well as some extensions of the method presented here based on their basic ideas are presented as well.

Multisensory interactions in early evoked brain activity follow the principle of inverse effectiveness	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multisensory; Crossmodal; Bisensory; Inverse effectiveness; ERP; EEG	AUDITORY-VISUAL INTERACTIONS; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; STIMULUS-INTENSITY; REACTION-TIME; HUMANS; POTENTIALS; EVENTS	A major determinant of multisensory integration, derived from single-neuron studies in animals, is the principle of inverse effectiveness (IE), which describes the phenomenon whereby maximal multisensory response enhancements occur when the constituent unisensory stimuli are minimally effective in evoking responses. Human behavioral studies, which have shown that multisensory interactions are strongest when stimuli are low in intensity are in agreement with the IE principle, but the neurophysiologic basis for this finding is unknown. In this high-density electroencephalography (EEG) study, we examined effects of stimulus intensity on multisensory audiovisual processing in event-related potentials (ERPs) and response time (RT) facilitation in the bisensory redundant target effect (RTE). The RTE describes that RTs are faster for bisensory redundant targets than for the respective unisensory targets. Participants were presented with semantically meaningless unisensory auditory, unisensory visual and bisensory audiovisual stimuli of low, middle and high intensity, while they were instructed to make a speeded button response when a stimulus in either modality was presented. Behavioral data showed that the RTE exceeded predictions on the basis of probability summations of unisensory RTs, indicative of integrative multisensory processing, but only for low intensity stimuli. Paralleling this finding, multisensory interactions in short latency (40-60 ms) ERPs with a left posterior and right anterior topography were found particularly for stimuli with low intensity. Our findings demonstrate that the IE principle is applicable to early multisensory processing in humans. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we report a Q555X mutation in synapsin 1 (SYN1), an X-linked gene encoding for a neuron-specific phosphoprotein implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and synaptogenesis. This nonsense mutation was found in all affected individuals from a large French-Canadian family segregating epilepsy and ASDs. Additional mutations in SYN1 (A51G, A550T and T567A) were found in 1.0 and 3.5% of French-Canadian individuals with autism and epilepsy, respectively. The majority of these SYN1 mutations were clustered in the proline-rich D-domain which is substrate of multiple protein kinases. When expressed in synapsin I (SynI) knockout (KO) neurons, all the D-domain mutants failed in rescuing the impairment in the size and trafficking of synaptic vesicle pools, whereas the wild-type human SynI fully reverted the KO phenotype. Moreover, the nonsense Q555X mutation had a dramatic impact on phosphorylation by MAPK/Erk and neurite outgrowth, whereas the missense A550T and T567A mutants displayed impaired targeting to nerve terminals. These results demonstrate that SYN1 is a novel predisposing gene to ASDs, in addition to epilepsy, and strengthen the hypothesis that a disturbance of synaptic homeostasis underlies the pathogenesis of both diseases.

Overlapping Roles and Collective Requirement for the Coreceptors GAS1, CDO, and BOC in SHH Pathway Function	DEVELOPMENTAL CELL			English	Article							HEDGEHOG-BINDING PROTEIN; SONIC HEDGEHOG; NEURAL-TUBE; CELL-SURFACE; GDNF FAMILY; DROSOPHILA ORTHOLOG; MODULATES FGF; FLOOR PLATE; RECEPTOR; SPECIFICATION	Secreted Hedgehog (HH) ligands signal through the canonical receptor Patched (PTCH1). However, recent studies implicate three additional HH-binding, cell-surface proteins, GAS1, CDO, and BOC, as putative coreceptors for HH ligands. A central question is to what degree these coreceptors function similarly and what their collective requirement in HH signal transduction is. Here we provide evidence that GAS1, COO, and BOC play overlapping and essential roles during HH-mediated ventral neural patterning of the mammalian neural tube. Specifically, we demonstrate two important roles for these molecules: an early role in cell fate specification of multiple neural progenitors and a later role in motor neuron progenitor maintenance. Most strikingly, genetic loss-of-function experiments indicate an obligatory requirement for GAS1, CDO, and BOC in HH pathway activity in multiple tissues.

Although Patched acts as the main Hh receptor in Drosophila, Hh signaling absolutely requires the additional Hh-binding proteins lhog and Boi. Here we show that, unexpectedly, cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) lacking Boc and Cdon, the vertebrate orthologs of lhog and Boi, still proliferate in response to Hh. This is because in their absence, Gas1, an Hh-binding protein not present in Drosophila, mediates Hh signaling. Consistently, only CGNPs lacking all three molecules-Boc, Cdon, and Gas1-have a complete loss of Hh-dependent proliferation. In a complementary manner, we find that a mutated Hh ligand that binds Patched1 but not Boc, Cdon, or Gas1 cannot activate Hh signaling. Together, this demonstrates an absolute requirement for Boc, Cdon, and Gas1 in Hh signaling and reveals a distinct requirement for ligand-binding components that distinguishes the vertebrate and invertebrate Hh receptor systems.

Some of these undesired actions appear after repeated administration and are related to adaptive changes directed at counteracting the consequences of sustained opioid receptor activation. Here we will discuss adaptations that contribute to the development of tolerance. The focus of the first part of the review is set on molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of opioid receptor signalling in heterologous expression systems and neurons. In the second part we assess how adaptations that take place in vivo may contribute to analgesic tolerance developed during repeated opioid administration.

This article is an update of the pediatric specificities of TBI management. Recent findings We review the evidences with regards to general management and therapeutic goals to prevent secondary injuries in pediatric TBI patients. Recent controversies in neurocritical care, such as multimodal neuromonitoring, hyperventilation, barbiturate coma, hypothermia, and decompressive surgery, are also highlighted. Summary Many therapeutic modalities in pediatric TBI have a low level of evidence. Further research is needed to establish clear resuscitation goals. Universal objectives may not be suitable for all patients; intensive neuromonitoring may help in identifying individual therapeutic goals and guiding the selection of treatments.

In vitro, SSCs form three-dimensional spermatogonial aggregates (clusters) when cultured with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2); serial passaging of clusters results in long-term SSC maintenance and expansion. However, the role of these growth factors in controlling patterns of SSC division and fate decision has not been understood thoroughly. We report here that in a short-term culture, GDNF and FGF2 increase the number of dividing SSCs, but not the total SSC number, compared to a no-growth-factor condition. Since the total germ cell number increases with growth factors, these results suggest that GDNF and FGF2 promote a SSC division pattern that sustains the size of the stem cell pool while generating committed progenitors. Our data also show that SSC numbers increase when the cluster structure is disintegrated and cell-cell interaction in clusters is disrupted. Collectively, these results suggest that in this culture system, GDNF and FGF2 stimulate SSC divisions that promote self-renewal and differentiation in the SSC population, and imply that the destruction of the cluster structure, a potential in vitro niche, may contribute to SSC expansion.

The C terminus of the protein contains an HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain of unknown function. Here, we determined the high-resolution 1.9-angstrom crystal structure of the HEPN domain from human sacsin. The structure is composed of five parallel alpha-helices with a large loop of several short helical segments. Two HEPN protomers assemble as a dimer to form a large positively charged cavity at the dimer interface that binds GTP and other nucleotides. The crystal structure reveals that the ARSACS N4549D mutation disrupts dimerization and protein folding. This study provides novel insights into the oligomerization state of sacsin and functions that are lost in mutations that cause ARSACS.

Early Growth Response 1 (Egr-1) Regulates Phosphorylation of Microtubule-associated Protein Tau in Mammalian Brain	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3-BETA; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR EGR-1; CYCLIN-DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE-5; NEURONAL CDC2-LIKE KINASE; NF-KAPPA-B; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MOUSE MODEL; GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSGENIC MICE; IN-VIVO	In the normal brain, tau protein is phosphorylated at a number of proline-and non-proline directed sites, which reduce tau microtubule binding and thus regulate microtubule dynamics. In Alzheimer disease (AD), tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated, leading to neurofibrillary tangle formation and microtubule disruption, suggesting a loss of regulatory mechanisms controlling tau phosphorylation. Early growth response 1 (Egr-1) is a transcription factor that is significantly up-regulated in AD brain. The pathological significance of this up-regulation is not known. In this study, we found that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of Egr-1 in rat brain hippocampus and primary neurons in culture activates proline-directed kinase Cdk5, inactivates PP1, promotes tau phosphorylation at both proline-directed Ser(396/404) and non-proline-directed Ser(262) sites, and destabilizes microtubules. Furthermore, in Egr-1(-/-) mouse brain, Cdk5 activity was decreased, PP1 activity was increased, and tau phosphorylation was reduced at both proline-directed and non-proline-directed sites. By using nerve growth factor-exposed PC12 cells, we determined that Egr-1 activates Cdk5 to promote phosphorylation of tau and inactivates PP1 via phosphorylation. When Cdk5 was inhibited, tau phosphorylation at both proline-and non-proline directed sites and PP1 phosphorylation were blocked, indicating that Egr-1 acts through Cdk5. By using an in vitro kinase assay and HEK-293 cells transfected with tau, PP1, and Cdk5, we found that Cdk5 phosphorylates Ser(396/404) directly. In addition, by phosphorylating and inactivating PP1, Cdk5 promotes tau phosphorylation at Ser(262) indirectly. Our results indicate that Egr-1 is an in vivo regulator of tau phosphorylation and suggest that in AD brain increased levels of Egr-1 aberrantly activate an Egr-1/Cdk5/PP1 pathway, leading to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, thus destabilizing the microtubule cytoskeleton.

Multiple Recurrent De Novo CNVs, Including Duplications of the 7q11.23 Williams Syndrome Region, Are Strongly Associated with Autism	NEURON			English	Article							COPY NUMBER VARIATION; RARE CHROMOSOMAL DELETIONS; HIDDEN-MARKOV MODEL; SNP GENOTYPING DATA; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; GENETIC DISORDER; BEUREN-SYNDROME; INCREASE RISK; EARLY-ONSET; GENOME	We have undertaken a genome-wide analysis of rare copy-number variation (CNV) in 1124 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) families, each comprised of a single proband, unaffected parents, and, in most kindreds, an unaffected sibling. We find significant association of ASD with de novo duplications of 7q11.23, where the reciprocal deletion causes Williams-Beuren syndrome, characterized by a highly social personality. We identify rare recurrent de novo CNVs at five additional regions, including 16p13.2 (encompassing genes USP7 and C16orf72) and Cadherin 13, and implement a rigorous approach to evaluating the statistical significance of these observations. Overall, large de novo CNVs, particularly those encompassing multiple genes, confer substantial risks (OR = 5.6; CI = 2.6-12.0, p = 2.4 x 10(-7)). We estimate there are 130-234 ASD-related CNV regions in the human genome and present compelling evidence, based on cumulative data, for association of rare de novo events at 7q11.23, 15q11.2-13.1, 16p11.2, and Neurexin 1.

In the developing spinal cord, Netrin-1 and Shh guide commissural axons toward the midline. However, the combined inhibition of their activity in commissural axon turning assays does not completely abrogate turning toward floor plate tissue, suggesting that additional guidance cues are present. Here we show that the prototypic angiogenic factor VEGF is secreted by the floor plate and is a chemoattractant for commissural axons in vitro and in vivo. Inactivation of Vegf in the floor plate or of its receptor Flk1 in commissural neurons causes axon guidance defects, whereas Flk1 blockade inhibits turning of axons to VEGF in vitro. Similar to Shh and Netrin-1, VEGF-mediated commissural axon guidance requires the activity of Src family kinases. Our results identify VEGF and Flk1 as a novel ligand/receptor pair controlling connmissural axon guidance.

We have shown that the netrin-1 receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) is involved in the functional organization of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system. Adult mice with a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in dcc exhibit changes in indexes of DA function, including DA-related behaviors. These phenotypes are only observed after puberty, a critical period in the maturation of the mesocortical DA projection. Here, we examined whether dcc heterozygous mice exhibit structural changes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) DA synaptic connectivity, before and after puberty. Stereological counts of tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH)-positive varicosities were increased in the cingulate 1 and prelimbic regions of the pregenual mPFC. dcc heterozygous mice also exhibited alterations in the size, complexity, and dendritic spine density of mPFC layer V pyramidal neuron basilar dendritic arbors. Remarkably, these presynaptic and postsynaptic partner phenotypes were not observed in juvenile mice, suggesting that DCC selectively influences the extensive branching and synaptic differentiation that occurs in the maturing mPFC DA circuit at puberty. Immunolabeling experiments in wild-type mice demonstrated that DCC is segregated to TH-positive fibers innervating the nucleus accumbens, with only scarce DCC labeling in mPFC TH-positive fibers. Netrin had an inverted target expression pattern. Thus, DCC-mediated netrin-1 signaling may influence the formation/maintenance of mesocorticolimbic DA topography. In support of this, we report that dcc heterozygous mice exhibit a twofold increase in the density of mPFC DCC/TH-positive varicosities. Our results implicate DCC-mediated netrin-1 signaling in the establishment of mPFC DA circuitry during puberty.

Despite the increasing availability of antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated dementia (HAD) continues to be a devastating consequence of HIV-1 infection of the brain although the underlying disease mechanisms remain uncertain. Herein, molecular diversity within the HIV-1 non-structural gene, Vpr, was examined in RNA sequences derived from brain and blood of HIV/AIDS patients with or without HIV-associated dementia (HAD) together with the ensuing pathobiological effects. Results: Cloned brain-and blood-derived full length vpr alleles revealed that amino acid residue 77 within the brain-derived alleles distinguished HAD (77Q) from non-demented (ND) HIV/AIDS patients (77R) (p < 0.05) although vpr transcripts were more frequently detected in HAD brains (p < 0.05). Full length HIV-1 clones encoding the 77R-ND residue induced higher IFN-alpha, MX1 and BST-2 transcript levels in human glia relative to the 77Q-HAD encoding virus (p < 0.05) but both viruses exhibited similar levels of gene expression and replication. Myeloid cells transfected with 77Q-(pVpr77Q-HAD), 77R (pVpr77R-ND) or Vpr null (pVpr((-)))-containing vectors showed that the pVpr77R-ND vector induced higher levels of immune gene expression (p < 0.05) and increased neurotoxicity (p < 0.05). Vpr peptides (amino acids 70-96) containing the 77Q-HAD or 77R-ND motifs induced similar levels of cytosolic calcium activation when exposed to human neurons. Human glia exposed to the 77R-ND peptide activated higher transcript levels of IFN-alpha, MX1, PRKRA and BST-2 relative to 77Q-HAD peptide (p < 0.05). The Vpr 77R-ND peptide was also more neurotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner when exposed to human neurons (p < 0.05). Stereotaxic implantation of full length Vpr, 77Q-HAD or 77R-ND peptides into the basal ganglia of mice revealed that full length Vpr and the 77R-ND peptide caused greater neurobehavioral deficits and neuronal injury compared with 77Q-HAD peptide-implanted animals (p < 0.05). Conclusions: These observations underscored the potent neuropathogenic properties of Vpr but also indicated viral diversity modulates innate neuroimmunity and neurodegeneration.

Examples include proliferative retinopathies (PRs) such as retinopathy of prematurity and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which are the leading causes of blindness in children and working-age adults. PRs are characterized by initial microvascular degeneration, followed by a compensatory albeit pathologic hypervascularization mounted by the hypoxic retina attempting to reinstate metabolic equilibrium. Paradoxically, this secondary revascularization fails to grow into the most ischemic regions of the retina. Instead, the new vessels are misdirected toward the vitreous, suggesting that vasorepulsive forces operate in the avascular hypoxic retina. In the present study, we demonstrate that the neuronal guidance cue semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is secreted by hypoxic neurons in the avascular retina in response to the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta. Sema3A contributes to vascular decay and later forms a chemical barrier that repels neo-vessels toward the vitreous. Conversely, silencing Sema3A expression enhances normal vascular regeneration within the ischemic retina, thereby diminishing aberrant neovascularization and preserving neuroretinal function.

DORSAL-VENTRAL DISTINCTION OF CHRONIC STRESS-INDUCED ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL ALTERATIONS IN THE RAT MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						stress; electrophysiology; limbic structures; synaptic plasticity; prefrontal cortex	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; IN-VIVO; NMDA RECEPTORS; DENDRITIC RETRACTION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; FEAR EXTINCTION; HIPPOCAMPAL CA1; DEPRESSION	Chronic stress causes neuronal adaptation and maladaptation in the widespread brain regions including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic structures, resulting in cognitive and affective dysfunctions. In this study, we examined the impacts of chronic stress on functional interaction between the medial PFC and limbic structures in rats. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in rats exposed to chronic stress unveiled disturbance of correlated local field potential activity between the PFC and limbic structures as well as impairment of synaptic plasticity induction in the limbic-PFC pathways. However, these stress-induced alterations in limbic PFC interaction were distinct along with the dorsal-ventral axis within the PFC, with greater stress vulnerability in the dorsal than the ventral PFC, such that alterations in the dorsal PFC became evident with much shorter duration of repeated stress exposure than those occurring in the ventral PFC. In agreement with the stress-induced alterations in limbic PFC interaction, spike firing patterns of neurons in the dorsal and ventral PFC were also differently modulated by chronic stress. These results suggest that chronic stress produces heterogeneous cellular and neural network adaptation and maladaptation within the PFC that affect limbic information integration mechanisms.

Mouse embryonic teratocarcinoma P19 cells exposed to solasodine for 2 days followed by a 5-day washout differentiated into cholinergic neurons that expressed specific neuronal markers and displayed important axonal formation that continued growing even 30 days after treatment. In vivo, a 2-week infusion of solasodine into the left ventricle of the rat brain followed by a 3-week washout resulted in a significant increase in bromodeoxyuridine uptake by cells of the ependymal layer, subventricular zone, and cortex that co-localized with doublecortin immunostaining, demonstrating the proliferative and differentiating properties of solasodine on neuronal progenitors. In addition, these data demonstrate that under our experimental conditions adult ependymal cells retrieved their proliferative and differentiating abilities. The GAP-43/HuD pathway was activated both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a role in the differentiating process triggered by solasodine. Solasodine treatment in rats resulted in a dramatic increase in expression of the cholesterol- and drug-binding translocator protein in ependymal cells, suggesting a possible role played by neurosteroid production in solasodine-induced neurogenesis. In GAD65-GFP mice that express the green fluorescent protein under the control of the glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kDa promoter, solasodine treatment increased the number of GABAergic progenitors and neuroblasts generated in the subventricular zone and present in the olfactory migratory tract. Taken together, these results suggest that solasodine offers an interesting approach to stimulate in situ neurogenesis from resident neuronal progenitors as part of neuron replacement therapy.

The Staufen 1 (Stau1) isoform was recently identified as necessary for the protein synthesis-dependent late phase long-term potentiation (late-LTP) and for the maintenance of mature dendritic spines and synaptic activity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, strongly suggesting a role of mRNA regulation by Stau1 in these processes. However, the causal relationship between these impairments in synaptic function (spine shape and basal synaptic activity) and plasticity (late-LTP) remains unclear. Here, we determine that the effects of Stau1 knockdown on spine shape and size are mimicked by blocking NMDA receptors (or elevating extracellular Mg2+) and that Stau1 knockdown in the presence of NMDA receptor blockade (or high Mg2+) has no further effect on spine shape and size. Moreover, the effect of Stau1 knockdown on late-LTP cannot be explained by these effects, since when tested in normal medium, slice cultures that had been treated with high Mg2+ (to impair NMDA receptor function) in combination with a control siRNA still exhibited late-LTP, while siRNA to Stau1 was still effective in blocking late-LTP. Our results indicate that Stau1 involvement in spine morphogenesis is dependent on ongoing NMDA receptor-mediated plasticity, but its effects on late-LTP are independent of these changes. These findings clarify the role of Stau1-dependent mRNA regulation in physiological and morphological changes underlying long-term synaptic plasticity in pyramidal cells.

In 1995, 2000 and 2006, this study followed fish consumption, Hg levels, and visual and motor functions in 31 villagers. Questionnaires gathered information on socio-demographics and diet. Hair Hg (H-Hg) levels were measured. Visual acuity, colour vision, manual dexterity and grip strength were assessed. Data was analysed using general linear models of repeated measures. Total fish consumption, similar in 1995 and 2000, decreased in 2006. Carnivorous fish consumption initially decreased and then remained stable, whereas non-carnivorous fish consumption first increased and then decreased. H-Hg declined from 17.6 to 7.8 mu g/g. Visual functions showed a significant decrease over time, with those with H-Hg >= 20 mu g/g in 1995 showing greater loss. Motor functions showed initial improvement and then returned to the 1995 performance level. Decrease in Hg exposure is attributed to the intervention and socio-economic changes in the village. While there may be a certain reversibility of motor deficits, visual capacities may decrease progressively with respect to exposure prior to the intervention.

Cortisol levels differed significantly (p<0.01) between the SIB and control group (SIB>control). Within-group analyses showed significant differences (p<0.05) in levels of salivary alpha-amylase between individuals with SIB and those with SIB meeting criteria for stereotyped movement disorder (SMD; SIB+SMD>SIB). Salivary alpha-.amylase was significantly correlated with frequency of stereotypy among the SIB group (r=0.36, p<0.05). These preliminary findings warrant further exploration into the role of the SAM system in the pathophysiology of SIB and related repetitive behaviors among individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders associated with intellectual disability.

While some rare cases may not be treated any other way, in most patients a more conventional, conservative, or validated approach such as coiling, parent vessel occlusion, or surgical clipping exists. Only a randomized clinical trial can answer the question of which treatment option leads to better patient outcomes. We report the design of the FIAT study, a clinical care trial aiming to compare angiographic and clinical outcomes following treatment with a Flow-Diverter or with the best conventional treatment option. The FIAT study will include both a randomized and a registry portion. Patients will be proposed randomization to either FD stenting or best conventional treatment option (observation, coiling, stenting, or clipping) as determined by the treating physician. FIAT will recruit a total of 338 patients, to show that i) FD stoning can be performed with an 'acceptable' immediate complication rate of less than 15% morbidity and mortality (defined as mRS > 2); ii) FD stenting can increase from 75 to 90% the proportion of patients with a "good outcome", defined as complete or near-complete occlusion of the aneurysm AND a good clinical outcome (mRS <= 2) at one year, as compared to the best conventional option. The FIAT study provides a scientific and ethical context to care for patients eligible for flow-diversion therapy.

Canadian Glioblastoma	Canadian recommendations for the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Glioblastoma multiforme; guidelines; pseudoprogression; re-irradiation; re-operation; chemotherapy; recurrence; progression	HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS; PHASE-II TRIAL; DI-NEURO-ONCOLOGIA; O-6-METHYLGUANINE DNA-METHYLTRANSFERASE; TEMOZOLOMIDE-REFRACTORY GLIOBLASTOMA; INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIOTHERAPY; SUPRATENTORIAL MALIGNANT GLIOMA; DOSE METRONOMIC CHEMOTHERAPY; NEWLY-DIAGNOSED GLIOBLASTOMA; BEVACIZUMAB PLUS IRINOTECAN	Recommendation 1: Multidisciplinary Approach To optimize treatment outcomes, the management of patients with recurrent glioblastoma should be individualized and should involve a multidisciplinary team approach, including neurosurgery, neuropathology, radiation oncology, neuro-oncology, and allied health professions. Recommendation 2: Imaging The standard imaging modality for assessment of recurrent glioblastoma is Gd-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Tumour recurrence should be assessed according to the criteria set out by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group. The optimal timing and frequency of MRI after chemoradiation and adjunctive therapy have not been established. Recommendation 3: Pseudo-progression Progression observed by MRI after chemoradiation can be pseudo-progression. Accordingly, treated patients should not be classified as having progressive disease by Gd-enhancing MRI within the first 12 weeks after the end of radiotherapy unless new enhancement is observed outside the radiotherapy field or viable tumour is confirmed by pathology at the time of a required re-operation. Adjuvant temozolomide should be continued and follow-up imaging obtained. Recommendation 4: Repeat Surgery Surgery can play a role in providing symptom relief and confirming tumour recurrence, pseudo-progression, or radiation necrosis. However, before surgical intervention, it is essential to clearly define treatment goals and the expected impact on prognosis and the patient's quality of life. In the absence of level 1 evidence, the decision to re-operate should be made according to individual circumstances, in consultation with the multidisciplinary team and the patient. Recommendation 5: Re-irradiation Re-irradiation is seldom recommended, but can be considered in carefully selected cases of recurrent glioblastoma. Recommendation 6: Systemic Therapy Clinical trials, when available, should be offered to all eligible patients. In the absence of a trial, systemic therapy, including temozolomide rechallenge or antiangiogenic therapy, may be considered. Combination therapy is still experimental; optimal drug combinations and sequencing have not been established.	[Easaw, J. C.] Tom Baker Canc Clin, Dept Oncol, Calgary, AB T2N 4N2, Canada; [Easaw, J.

A multicentre open-label safety and efficacy study of tetrodotoxin for cancer pain	CURRENT ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Clinical trial; cancer pain; analgesic; tetrodotoxin; long-term; safety; efficacy; open-label	SODIUM-CHANNELS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MANAGEMENT; LIDOCAINE; NEUROMAS	Background Cancer pain is highly prevalent, and existing treatments are often insufficient to provide adequate relief. Objectives We assessed the long-term safety and efficacy of subcutaneous tetrodotoxin treatment in reducing the intensity of chronic cancer-related pain. Methods In this multicentre open-label longitudinal trial, 30 mu g tetrodotoxin was administered subcutaneously twice daily for 4 days in a heterogeneous cohort of patients with persistent pain despite opioids and other analgesics. "Responder" was defined as a mean reduction of 30% or more in pain intensity from baseline; and "clinical responder" as some pain reduction, but less than 30%, plus agreement on the part of both the patient and the physician that a meaningful analgesic response to treatment had occurred. Results Of 45 patients who entered the longitudinal trial, 41 had sufficient data for analysis. Of all 45 patients, 21 (47%) met the criteria for "responder" [16 patients (36%)] or "clinical responder" [5 patients (11%)]. Onset of pain relief was typically cumulative over days, and after administration ended, the analgesic effect subsided over the course of a few weeks. No evidence of loss of analgesic effect was observed during subsequent treatments (2526 patient days in total and a maximum of 400 days in 1 patient). One patient withdrew from the study because of adverse events. Toxicity was usually mild (82%) or moderate (13%), and remained so through subsequent treatment cycles, with no evidence of cumulative toxicity or tolerance. Conclusions Long-term treatment with tetrodotoxin is associated with acceptable toxicity and, in a substantial minority of patients, resulted in a sustained analgesic effect. Further study of tetrodotoxin for moderate-to-severe cancer pain is warranted.	[Hagen, N. A.] Tom Baker Canc Clin, Calgary, AB T2N 4N2, Canada; [Hagen, N.

Multivariate dependencies between difficult childhood, temperament and antisocial personality disorder in a population of French male prisoners	REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article						Biostatistics; Personality disorder; Temperament and character inventory; Risk factors; Prison	INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; AGE 3 YEARS; DSM-IV; AGGRESSION; PREVALENCE; VALIDATION; BEHAVIOR; PROPOSAL; CHILDREN; MINI	Background. - The aim of this study was to contribute to clarification of the relations between antisocial personality disorder (APD) and its potential risk factors in a population of 560 French male prisoners. Methods. - Adverse childhood was assessed as a latent variable determined by several traumatic events. APD (MINI), character and temperament (Cloninger's model), WAIS (R)-III similarities subtest and psychosocial characteristics were assessed by two clinicians. The WAIS (R)-III subtest accounts for verbal and cognitive performance. We used a structural model to determine the weight of the different pathways between adverse childhood and APD. Results. - Study confirmed the major and direct role of adverse childhood (standardized coefficient = 0.48). An intermediate effect mediated by character (considered as a global variable) and novelty-seeking was also shown, confirming previous results from the literature. Conclusion. - This study emphasizes the role of adverse childhood in APD, suggesting the potential benefit of early intervention in the prevention of antisocial behaviours.

To characterize the origin of this prespike BOLD signal change, we looked for electrographic changes in stereo-EEG (SEEG) possibly preceding the scalp spike in patients that showed early BOLD response in EEG/fMRI. Methods: We studied four patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent EEG/fMRI, showed a prespike BOLD response, and were then studied with depth electrodes for presurgical localization of the epileptic generator. Early BOLD responses in the region of the spike field were analyzed using models with hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) peaking from -9 to +9 s around the spike. SEEG recordings in the period and location corresponding to the early HRF responses were analyzed to detect if electrographic changes were present in the SEEG before the scalp abnormality. Key Findings: One of the four patients presented a SEEG interictal discharge in the period corresponding to the early BOLD response. In the other three, no electrographic changes were detected in the SEEG in the period corresponding to early BOLD changes. Significance: Although the early BOLD activity may sometimes be explained by a synchronized neural discharge detectable with SEEG but not visible on the scalp EEG, in most cases the early BOLD response reflects a metabolic phenomenon that does not appear to result from a synchronized neuronal discharge. Prespike metabolic responses can result from synchronized or non-synchronized neuronal activity, or from nonneuronal mechanisms including glia.

The development of multisensory speech perception continues into the late childhood years	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						audiovisual; children; crossmodal; intersensory; sensory integration; speech-in-noise	AUDITORY-VISUAL INTEGRATION; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; AUDIOVISUAL SPEECH; INTERMODAL REPRESENTATION; CHILDRENS PERCEPTION; CORTICAL THICKNESS; SEEING VOICES; RECOGNITION; INFANTS; NOISE	Observing a speaker's articulations substantially improves the intelligibility of spoken speech, especially under noisy listening conditions. This multisensory integration of speech inputs is crucial to effective communication. Appropriate development of this ability has major implications for children in classroom and social settings, and deficits in it have been linked to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism. It is clear from structural imaging studies that there is a prolonged maturational course within regions of the perisylvian cortex that persists into late childhood, and these regions have been firmly established as being crucial to speech and language functions. Given this protracted maturational timeframe, we reasoned that multisensory speech processing might well show a similarly protracted developmental course. Previous work in adults has shown that audiovisual enhancement in word recognition is most apparent within a restricted range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Here, we investigated when these properties emerge during childhood by testing multisensory speech recognition abilities in typically developing children aged between 5 and 14 years, and comparing them with those of adults. By parametrically varying SNRs, we found that children benefited significantly less from observing visual articulations, displaying considerably less audiovisual enhancement. The findings suggest that improvement in the ability to recognize speech-in-noise and in audiovisual integration during speech perception continues quite late into the childhood years. The implication is that a considerable amount of multisensory learning remains to be achieved during the later schooling years, and that explicit efforts to accommodate this learning may well be warranted.

The most common location is in the pineal gland; suprasellar germ cell tumors are rare. We present an additional case of a suprasellar choriocarcinoma producing GH, and review the literature. Case: This French Canadian, 17 year-old male presented to the ER with a history of mild weight loss and an episode of syncope while hiking in Mexico, but with no other neurological symptoms. Puberty began at age 13 years (growth spurt: 15-16 years), and he attained an adult height within genetic target by age 16 years. Past medical history was negative except for myopia diagnosed during childhood. System review revealed increased thirst and nocturia. The mother was treated for an oligo-astrocytoma in 2007. Clinical examination showed a euthyroid, well-looking young man with 20 ml testicles. Endocrine evaluation revealed elevated testosterone, mildly elevated PRL, borderline low FT4, and decreased IGF-I, morning cortisol and urine osmolality; tumor markers were positive in serum and CSF (hCG>50 IU/L, AFP>10 ng/mL). A transphenoidal biopsy of a 4.5 cm, homogeneous, non-calcified, suprasellar mass was compatible with the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma and stained intensely for hCG and hGH, presumably the placental variant (GH-V) as previously found in vitro in choriocarcinoma cell lines. Combined chemotherapy and irradiation led to tumor regression and undetectable serum hCG to 36 months of follow-up. He is doing well with no evidence of tumor progression and is on complete hormone replacement therapy. Conclusions: Choriocarcinomas can have a hormonal profile that delays the development of symptoms, due to hCG stimulation of both the gonadal and thyroid axes. This report corroborates previous in vitro evidence that choriocarcinoma cells are able to make GH-V. To what extent the patient's tumor-derived GH contributed to his normal growth is not known. Prognosis for this intracranial neoplasm is very reserved, although combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy has been successful in our patient now 36 months post-diagnosis.

However, alternative techniques, such as conventional MRI may have advantages in terms of radiation exposure and sensitivity to detect brain injury. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), a relatively novel MRI sequence, shows promise in terms of its sensitivity in detecting hemorrhagic lesions; however, its clinical potential remains uncertain. In this observational study of children (5-16 years of age) with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at a tertiary pediatric emergency department (ED) we compared the ability of detecting traumatic brain lesions on acute CT and MRI/SWI similar to 5 weeks post-injury based on detecting the presence or absence, extent, and type of traumatic brain lesions. We analyzed the results of 76 patients (53 male) after TBI (mean age 10.24 +/- 2.50 years, range 5.75-14.67 years). Glasgow Coma Score was 13-15 in 54 patients (71%), 9-12 in 13 patients (17%) and <8 in 9 patients (12%). CTs were completed in the ED; MRI and SWI were completed at a mean of 36.11 +/- 15.75 days post-injury. Detection of any lesions occurred on CT scan in 68%, on MRI in 54%, and on SWI in 86% of cases, and SWI detected additional lesions 30% of the time compared to CT and MRI. SWI may be more sensitive in detecting traumatic lesions than CT or MRI. This may be important for the ongoing management of TBIs and their prognosis.

It relies on several cognitive control operations that are mediated by different regions of the prefrontal cortex. While much of our knowledge about the functional subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex comes from the systematic assessment of patients with brain damage, animal models have served as the predominant tool for investigating specific structure function relationships within the prefrontal cortex, especially as they relate to complex executive behaviors. These studies generally involve the targeted disruption of neural circuits combined with behavioral testing using carefully designed cognitive paradigms. In this review, I will describe a broad range of such experiments conducted in rats and monkeys that together reveal the distinct contributions of dorsal, medial, and ventral prefrontal cortex to different aspects of executive function. The effects of lesions and local pharmacological manipulations have provided valuable insights into the neural underpinnings of executive function and its neurochemical modulation. Despite the challenges associated with establishing a precise homology between animal models of prefrontal function and the human brain, such models currently offer the best means to systematically investigate the cognitive building blocks of executive function. This helps define the neural circuits that lead to a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders and facilitate the development of effective therapeutic strategies to ameliorate the associated cognitive impairments.

It has been used not only with aphasia but also with any condition that results in language impairment (Alzheimer's, autism, cerebellar lesions, developmental language disorders, mild cognitive impairment, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, vascular dementia, etc.). It has also been used for research purposes on non-brain-damaged unilingual and bilingual populations. By means of its 32 tasks, it assesses comprehension and production of implicit linguistic competence and metalinguistic knowledge (which provide indications for apposite rehabilitation strategies).

In bilingual aphasia, damage to the fronto-subcortical loop may lead to pathological language switching and mixing and the attrition of the more automatic language (usually L1). We present the case of JZ, a bilingual Basque-Spanish 53-year-old man who, after haematoma in the left basal ganglia, presented with executive deficits and aphasia, characterised by more impaired language processing in Basque, his L1. Assessment with the Bilingual Aphasia Test revealed impaired spontaneous and automatic speech production and speech rate in L1, as well as impaired L2-to-L1 sentence translation. Later observation led to the assessment of verbal and non-verbal executive control, which allowed JZ's impaired performance on language tasks to be related to executive dysfunction. In line with previous research, we report the significant attrition of L1 following damage to the left basal ganglia, reported for the first time in a Basque-Spanish bilingual. Implications for models of declarative and procedural memory are discussed.

J	Achim, A; Marquis, A				Achim, Andre; Marquis, Alexandra			An automated version of the BAT Syntactic Comprehension task for assessing auditory L2 proficiency in healthy adults	CLINICAL LINGUISTICS & PHONETICS			English	Article						multilingualism; Bilingual Aphasia Test; L2 assessment		Studies of bilingualism sometimes require healthy subjects to be assessed for proficiency at auditory sentence processing in their second language (L2). The Syntactic Comprehension task of the Bilingual Aphasia Test could satisfy this need. For ease and uniformity of application, we automated its English (Paradis, M., Libben, G., and Hummel, K. (1987). The Bilingual Aphasia Test. English version. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates) and French (Paradis, M., & Goldblum, M. C. (1987). The Bilingual Aphasia Test, French version. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates) versions. Although the Bilingual Aphasia Test is meant to assess neurological disorders affecting language, we hypothesised that ceiling performance in L2 would be rare and L2 errors should be consistent with lack of processing automaticity. Initial data from 13 French-English and 4 English-French bilinguals confirm these expectations. Thus, the automated Syntactic Comprehension task (available online for PC and Mac platforms) is indeed suited to test bilingual English and French proficiency levels in healthy adults.

We explored the brain processes involved in these inferences to test whether they are similar to those found when judging full-blown emotions. We recorded the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by faces of unknown persons who, when they were photographed, were not asked to adopt any particular expression. During the ERP recording, participants had to decide whether each face appeared to be that of a positively, negatively, ambiguously, or neutrally intentioned person. The early posterior negativity, the EPN, was found smaller for neutrally categorized faces than for the other faces, suggesting that the automatic processes it indexes are similar to those evoked by full-blown expressions and thus that these processes might be involved in the decoding of intentions. In contrast, in the same 200-400 ms time window, ERPs were not more negative at anterior sites for neutrally intentioned faces. Second, the peaks of the late positive potentials (LPPs) maximal at parietal sites around 700 ms postonset were not significantly smaller for neutrally intentioned faces. Third, the slow positive waves that followed the LPP were larger for faces that took more time to categorize, that is, for ambiguously intentioned faces. These three series of unexpected results may indicate processes similar to those triggered by full-blown emotions studies, but they question the characteristics of these processes.	[Debruille, J.

First published March 30, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00975.2010.-There is considerable debate on the extent to which biomechanical properties of movements are taken into account before and during voluntary movements. For example, while several models have described reach planning as primarily kinematic, some studies have suggested that implicit knowledge about biomechanics may also exert some influence on the planning of reaching movements. Here, we investigated whether decisions about reaching movements are influenced by biomechanical factors and whether these factors are taken into account before movement onset. To this end, we designed an experimental paradigm in which humans made free choices between two potential reaching movements where the options varied in path distance as well as biomechanical factors related to movement energy and stability. Our results suggest that the biomechanical properties of potential actions strongly influence the selection between them. In particular, in our task, subjects preferred movements whose final trajectory was better aligned with the major axis of the arm's mobility ellipse, even when the launching properties were very similar. This reveals that the nervous system can predict biomechanical properties of potential actions before movement onset and that these predictions, in addition to purely abstract criteria, may influence the decision-making process.

An Event-Related Brain Potential Study of Age Differences in Audiovisual Speech Perception	PSYCHOLOGY AND AGING			English	Article						ERPs; audiovisual speech; multisensory processing; auditory evoked potentials; aging	VISUAL SPEECH; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; VISIBLE SPEECH; ADULTS; ATTENTION; HEARING; MEMORY; YOUNG; COMPREHENSION; NOISE	The current study addressed the question whether audiovisual (AV) speech can improve speech perception in older and younger adults in a noisy environment. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to investigate age-related differences in the processes underlying AV speech perception. Participants performed an object categorization task in three conditions, namely auditory-only (A), visual-only (V), and AV(speech). Both age groups revealed an equivalent behavioral AV(speech) benefit over unisensory trials. ERP analyses revealed an amplitude reduction of the auditory P1 and N1 on AV(speech) trials relative to the summed unisensory (A + V) response in both age groups. These amplitude reductions are interpreted as an indication of multisensory efficiency as fewer neural resources were recruited to achieve better performance. Of interest, the observed P1 amplitude reduction was larger in older adults. Younger and older adults also showed an earlier auditory NI in AV(speech) relative to A and A + V trials, an effect that was again greater in the older adults. The degree of multisensory latency shift was predicted by basic auditory functioning (i.e., higher hearing thresholds were associated with larger latency shifts) in both age groups. Together, the results show that AV speech processing is not only intact in older adults, but that the facilitation of neural responses occurs earlier in and to a greater extent than in younger adults. Thus, older adults appear to benefit more from additional visual speech cues than younger adults, possibly to compensate for more impoverished unisensory inputs because of sensory aging.

Muscle Study Grp	Observational Study of Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2 and 3 Functional Outcomes Over 1 Year	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL MOTOR SCALE; SMN2 COPY NUMBER; NATURAL-HISTORY; GENE-FREQUENCY; SMA; CHILDHOOD; DIFFERENTIATION; CLASSIFICATION; POPULATION; PREDICTION	Objective: To characterize the short-term course of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in a genetically and clinically well-defined cohort of patients with SMA. Design: A comprehensive multicenter, longitudinal, observational study. Setting: The Pediatric Neuromuscular Clinical Research Network for SMA, a consortium of clinical investigators at 3 clinical sites. Participants: Sixty-five participants with SMA types 2 and 3, aged 20 months to 45 years, were prospectively evaluated. Intervention: We collected demographic and medical history information and determined the SMN2 copy number. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical outcomes included measures of motor function (Gross Motor Function Measure and expanded Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale), pulmonary function (forced vital capacity), and muscle strength (myometry). Participants were evaluated every 2 months for the initial 6 months and every 3 months for the subsequent 6 months. We evaluated change over 12 months for all clinical outcomes and examined potential correlates of change over time including age, sex, SMA type, ambulatory status, SMN2 copy number, medication use, and baseline function. Results: There were no significant changes over 12 months in motor function, pulmonary function, and muscle strength measures. There was evidence of motor function gain in ambulatory patients, especially in those children younger than 5 years. Scoliosis surgery during the observation period led to a subsequent decline in motor function. Conclusions: Our results confirm previous clinical reports suggesting that SMA types 2 and 3 represent chronic phenotypes that have relatively stable clinical courses. We did not detect any measurable clinical disease progression in SMA types 2 and 3 over 12 months, suggesting that clinical trials will have to be designed to measure improvement rather than stabilization of disease progression.

In southern Africa, two techno-traditions, the Still Bay and the Howiesons Poort, have raised interest because of their relatively early cultural complexity. What might have driven the development of the innovative practices and ideas between ca. 77,000 and 59,000 years ago? Explanations for the ascent and demise of these two entities must focus on analyses of recovered materials and in situ features such as hearths and spatial patterning. They must also consider whether these innovations are likely to have ensued from cognitive evolution in Homo sapiens and trace the changes in brain organization and cognitive functions that best explain them. This article presents an updated review of the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort industries and argues that innovations during the Late Pleistocene must be related to a previous expansion of the higher association areas of the temporal and parietal cortices underlying higher theory of mind, perspective taking, and attentional flexibility.

The neural control of fast vs. slow vergence eye movements	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						binocular; burst neuron; conjugate; extraocular; monocular; saccade	OCULOMOTOR BURST GENERATOR; SACCADIC BURST; FACILITATED VERGENCE; DISJUNCTIVE SACCADES; ON-DIRECTIONS; NEURONS; DYNAMICS; NUCLEUS; CONJUGATE; ABDUCENS	When looking between targets located in three-dimensional space, information about relative depth is sent from the visual cortex to the motor control centers in the brainstem, which are responsible for generating appropriate motor commands to move the eyes. Surprisingly, how the neurons in the brainstem use the depth information supplied by the visual cortex to precisely aim each eye on a visual target remains highly controversial. This review will consider the results of recent studies that have focused on determining how individual neurons contribute to realigning gaze when we look between objects located at different depths. In particular, the results of new experiments provide compelling evidence that the majority of saccadic neurons dynamically encode the movement of an individual eye, and show that the time-varying discharge of the saccadic neuron population encodes the drive required to account for vergence facilitation during disconjugate saccades. Notably, these results suggest that an additional input (i.e. from a separate vergence subsystem) is not required to shape the activity of motoneurons during disconjugate saccades. Furthermore, whereas motoneurons drive both fast and slow vergence movements, saccadic neurons discharge only during fast vergence movements, emphasizing the existence of distinct premotor pathways for controlling fast vs. slow vergence. Taken together, these recent findings contradict the traditional view that the brain is circuited with independent pathways for conjugate and vergence control, and thus provide an important new insight into how the brain controls three-dimensional gaze shifts.

A Game Platform for Treatment of Amblyopia	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biology; biomedical engineering; brain stimulation; cognition; cognitive informatics; cybernetics; medical diagnosis; medical treatment; neural engineering; physiology; psychology; psychometric testing; sensitivity and specificity	STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; CHILDREN; THERAPY; ADULTS; EYE	We have developed a prototype device for take-home use that can be used in the treatment of amblyopia. The therapeutic scenario we envision involves patients first visiting a clinic, where their vision parameters are assessed and suitable parameters are determined for therapy. Patients then proceed with the actual therapeutic treatment on their own, using our device, which consists of an Apple iPod Touch running a specially modified game application. Our rationale for choosing to develop the prototype around a game stems from multiple requirements that such an application satisfies. First, system operation must be sufficiently straightforward that ease-of-use is not an obstacle. Second, the application itself should be compelling and motivate use more so than a traditional therapeutic task if it is to be used regularly outside of the clinic. This is particularly relevant for children, as compliance is a major issue for current treatments of childhood amblyopia. However, despite the traditional opinion that treatment of amblyopia is only effective in children, our initial results add to the growing body of evidence that improvements in visual function can be achieved in adults with amblyopia.

The proposed tactile probe is made of a small metallic rod with a single-axis accelerometer attached near its tip. Surface identification is based on analyzing acceleration patterns induced at the tip of this mechanically robust tactile probe, while it is passively dragged along a surface. A training dataset was collected over ten different indoor and outdoor surfaces. Classification results for an artificial neural network were positive, with an 89.9% and 94.6% success rate for 1- and 4-s time windows of data, respectively. We also demonstrated that the same tactile probe can be used for unsupervised learning of terrains. For 1-s time windows of data, the classification success rate was only reduced to 74.1%. Finally, a blind mobile robot, performing real-time classification of surfaces, demonstrated the feasibility of this tactile probe as a guidance mechanism.

Its primary function is to cleave a wide range of small oligopeptides, including neuroactive peptides. We have used force biased molecular dynamics simulation to study the binding mechanism of POP. We examined three possible binding pathways using Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) and Umbrella Sampling (US) on a crystal structure of porcine POP with bound Z-pro-prolinal (ZPP). Using SMD, an exit pathway between the first and seventh blade of the beta-propeller domain of POP was found to be a nonviable route. US on binding pathways through the beta-propeller tunnel and the TYR190-GLN208 flexible loop at the interface between both POP domains allowed us to isolate the flexible loop pathway as the most probable. Further analysis of that pathway suggests a long-range covariation of the interdomain H-bond network, which indicates the possibility of large-scale domain reorientation observed in bacterial homologues and hypothesized to also occur in human POP.

Whether non-frontal brain regions are important for insight remains to be investigated. We used a multi-method approach to examine the neural morphometry of all cortical regions for insight in first-episode psychosis. Insight was rated in 79 people with a first-episode psychosis with the awareness of illness and awareness of treatment need and efficacy items of the Scale for assessment of Unawareness of Mental Disorder. Participants were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical thickness analysis and voxel-based morphometry were utilized to identify the possible neuroanatomical basis of insight. Cortical thickness technique revealed that poorer awareness of illness was associated with regional thinning in left middle frontal and inferior temporal gyri. Poorer awareness of treatment need and efficacy was associated with cortical thinning in left medial frontal gyrus, precuneus and temporal gyri. No significant associations emerged between any insight measure and gray matter density using voxel-based morphometry. The results confirm predictions derived from the anosognosia/neuropsychology account and assert that. regional thickness in frontal cortex is associated with awareness of illness in the early phase of psychosis. The fact that prominent thickness reductions emerged in non-frontal regions of the brain in parietal and temporal cortices for both awareness of illness and awareness of treatment need and efficacy suggests that the neural signature of insight involves a network of brain structures, and not only the frontal lobes as previously suggested.

How and when clinicians interpret defenses, however, has received little empirical examination. In an effort to facilitate the empirical study of defense interpretation, we reviewed 15 works by noted authors who gave a prominent role to interpreting defenses in discussing clinical work in general patient populations. Our goal was to identify and systematize distinct themes from these authors that might be testable hypotheses. We identified 74 themes related to the interpretation of defenses in psychotherapy for-example, "interpreting too frequently diminishes the emotional impact of interpretation"-which we organized into 17 distinct categories (e.g., factors associated with positive outcome). We subsequently selected 19 themes that were readily operationalizable as hypotheses and examination of which would advance clinical practice. These hypotheses address issues such as when, in what order, and how to interpret defensive material and what successful outcomes would be. We then describe prototypes of research designs, employing naturalistic observation, randomized controlled trials, or experimental laboratory studies, which could investigate these important hypotheses. Overall, this report codifies current clinical maxims and then provides future research directions for determining how clinicians can most effectively address defenses in psychotherapy.

However, the roles played here by the left and right amygdala individually remain unknown. Here we investigated this question by applying the 'Bubbles' method, which asks viewers to discriminate facial emotions from randomly sampled small regions of a face, to 23 neurological participants with focal, unilateral amygdala damage (10 to the right amygdala). We found a statistically significant asymmetry in the use of eye information when comparing those with unilateral left lesions to those with unilateral right lesions, specifically during emotion judgments. The findings have implications for the amygdala's role in emotion recognition and gaze direction during face processing.

In contrast, SST via activation of five different receptor subtypes inhibits cell proliferation and has been potential target in tumor treatment. To gain further insight for the effect of SSTRs on EGFR activated signaling, we determine the role of SSTR1 and SSTR1/5 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. We here demonstrate that cells transfected with SSTR1 or SSTR1/5 negatively regulates EGF mediated effects attributed to the inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, MAPKs as well as the cell survival signaling. Furthermore, SSTR effects were significantly enhanced in cells when EGFR was knock down using siRNA or treated with selective antagonist (AG1478). Most importantly, the presence of SSTR in addition to modulating signaling pathways leads to the dissociation of the constitutive and EGF induced heteromeric complex of EGFR/ErbB2. Furthermore, cells cotransfected with SSTR1/5 display pronounced effect of SST on the signaling and dissociation of the EGFR/ErbB2 heteromeric complex than the cells expressing SSTR1 alone. Taken together this study provides the first evidence that the presence of SSTR controls EGF mediated cell survival pathway via dissociation of ErbB heteromeric complex. We propose that the activation of SSTR and blockade of EGFR might serve novel therapeutic approach in inhibition of tumor proliferation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the effect of memory training on brain activation in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and to assess whether it can reverse the brain changes associated with mild cognitive impairment. Brain activation associated with verbal encoding and retrieval was recorded twice prior to training and once after training. In subjects with mild cognitive impairment, increased activation was found after training within a large network that included the frontal, temporal and parietal areas. Healthy controls showed mostly areas of decreased activation following training. Comparison with pre-training indicated that subjects with mild cognitive impairment used a combination of specialized areas; that is, areas activated prior to training and new alternative areas activated following training. However, only activation of the right inferior parietal lobule, a new area of activation, correlated with performance. Furthermore, the differences between the brain activation patterns of subjects with mild cognitive impairment and those of healthy controls were attenuated by training in a number of brain regions. These results indicate that memory training can result in significant neural changes that are measurable with brain imaging. They also show that the brains of people with mild cognitive impairment remain highly plastic.

We utilized a 6 months multi-wave, longitudinal design, and results of idiographic, multilevel modeling indicated that higher levels of anxiety sensitivity predicted higher levels of anxious, but not depressive, symptoms. Further, results suggested that higher levels of anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between higher levels of neuroticism and anxious, but not depressive, symptoms. In contrast to past research, the present findings suggested that anxiety sensitivity differentially predicted anxious as opposed to depressive symptomology indicating model specificity.

J	Capinha, C; Leung, B; Anastacio, P				Capinha, Cesar; Leung, Brian; Anastacio, Pedro			Predicting worldwide invasiveness for four major problematic decapods: an evaluation of using different calibration sets	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							CRAYFISH PROCAMBARUS-CLARKII; FUTURE BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS; PSEUDO-ABSENCE DATA; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; HABITAT-SUITABILITY; PLANT INVASIONS; INVADED RANGES; NATIVE-RANGE	Recently, there has been much debate whether niche based models (NBM) can predict biological invasions into new areas. These studies have chiefly focused on the type of occurrence data to use for model calibration. Additionally, pseudo-absences are also known to cause uncertainty in NBM, but are rarely tested for predicting invasiveness. Here we test the implications of using different calibration sets for building worldwide invasiveness models for four major problematic decapods: Cherax destructor, Eriocheir sinensis, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. Using Artificial Neural Networks models we compared predictions containing either native range occurrences (NRO), native and invasive occurrences (NIO) and invasive only (IRO) coupled with three types of pseudo-absences - based on sampling only 1) the native range (NRA), 2) native and invasive ranges (NIA), and 3) worldwide random (WRA). We further analysed the potential gains in accuracy obtained through averaging across multiple models. Our results showed that NRO and IRO provided the best predictions for native and invaded ranges, respectively. Still, NIO provided the best balance in predicting both ranges. Pseudo-absences had a large influence on the predictive performance of the models, and were more important for predictiveness than types of occurrences. Specifically, WRA performed the best and NRA and NIA performed poorly. We also found little benefit in combining predictions since best performing single-models showed consistently higher accuracies. We conclude that NBM can provide useful information in forecasting invasiveness but are largely dependent on the type of initial information used and more efforts should be placed on recognizing its implications. Our results also show extensive areas which are highly suitable for the studied species worldwide. In total these areas reach from three to nine times the species current ranges and large portions of them are contiguous with currently invasive populations.

Since perfusion deficits may hasten clinical deterioration and have been correlated with negative treatment outcome, strategies to improve the cerebral circulation should form an integral element of AD therapeutic efforts. These efforts have yielded several experimental models, some of which constitute AD models proper, others which specifically recapture the AD cerebrovascular pathology, characterized by anatomical alterations in brain vessel structure, as well as molecular changes within vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier. The following paper will present the elements of AD neurovascular dysfunction and review the in vitro and in vivo model systems that have served to deepen our understanding of it. It will also critically evaluate selected groups of compounds, the FDA-approved cholinesterase inhibitors and thiazolidinediones, for their ability to correct neurovascular dysfunction in AD patients and models. These and several others are emerging as compounds with pleiotropic actions that may positively impact dysfunctional cerebrovascular, glial, and neuronal networks in AD.

Following pulses of rhythmic stimuli, neurons of the retina and cortex produce activity that closely approximates the timing of an omitted pulse. This omitted stimulus response (OSR) is generally interpreted as a transient response to rhythmic input and is thought to form a basis of short-term perceptual memories. Despite its ubiquity across species and experimental protocols, the mechanisms underlying OSRs remain poorly understood. In particular, the highly transient nature of OSRs, typically limited to a single cycle after stimulation, cannot be explained by a simple mechanism that would remain locked to the frequency of stimulation. Here, we describe a set of realistic simulations that capture OSRs over a range of stimulation frequencies matching experimental work. The model does not require an explicit mechanism for learning temporal sequences. Instead, it relies on spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a form of synaptic modification that is sensitive to the timing of pre- and post-synaptic action potentials. In the model, the transient nature of OSRs is attributed to the heterogeneous nature of neural properties and connections, creating intricate forms of activity that are continuously changing over time. Combined with STDP, neural heterogeneity enabled OSRs to complex rhythmic patterns as well as OSRs following a delay period. These results link the response of neurons to rhythmic patterns with the capacity of heterogeneous circuits to produce transient and highly flexible forms of neural activity.

Here we examined signal detection in situations that promote either the fusion of tonal elements into a single sound object or the segregation of a mistuned element (i.e., harmonic) that "popped out" as a separate individuated auditory object and yielded the perception of concurrent sound objects. On each trial, participants indicated whether the incoming complex sound contained a brief gap or not. The gap (i.e., signal) was always inserted in the middle of one of the tonal elements. Our findings were consistent with an object-based account in which perception of two simultaneous auditory objects interfered with signal detection. This effect was observed for a wide range of gap durations and was greater when the mistuned harmonic was perceived as a separate object. These results suggest that attention may be initially shared among concurrent sound objects thereby reducing listeners' ability to process acoustic details belonging to a particular sound object. These findings provide new theoretical insight for our understanding of auditory attention and auditory scene analysis.	[Leung, Ada W.

In piano performance, timing and amplitude are the principal parameters the performer can vary. We examined the way in which such variation serves to communicate emotion by manipulating timing and amplitude in performances of classical piano pieces. Over three experiments, listeners rated the emotional expressivity of performances and their manipulated versions. In Experiments 1 and 2, timing and amplitude information were covaried; judgments were monotonically decreasing with performance variability, demonstrating that the rank ordering of acoustical manipulations was captured by participants' responses. Further, participants' judgments formed an S-shaped (sigmoidal) function in which greater sensitivity was seen for musical manipulations in the middle of the range than at the extremes. In Experiment 3, timing and amplitude were manipulated independently; timing variation was found to provide more expressive information than did amplitude. Across all three experiments, listeners demonstrated sensitivity to the expressive cues we manipulated, with sensitivity increasing as a function of musical experience.

Materials and Methods: Four MS patients were scanned using a new dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol based on an uninterrupted two-part acquisition consisting of an initial part at high temporal and low spatial resolutions and a second part at low temporal and high spatial resolutions. The method preserves both the high spatial resolution needed for the often small size of lesions and the high temporal resolution required during the first minute after injection to sufficiently sample the first-pass bolus. Simulations compared the performance of this new protocol with the conventional one at low temporal and high spatial resolutions throughout. Results: The BBB permeability estimates changed by up to 33% between the two protocols. The new protocol led to simulated error on K-trans of 7%-10%, versus 7%-30% with the conventional protocol, and was more robust with respect to offsets between acquisition and injection start times, differences in shape of the first-pass peak, and permeability values. Conclusion: The dual-temporal resolution protocol produces improved BBB permeability estimates and provides a more complete view of active inflammatory MS lesion pathology.	[Jelescu, I.

However, the processes triggered by this up-regulation have not been explored. We present here a study of the effect of ApoD on the early transcriptional changes upon OS in the mouse cerebellum using microarray profiling. ApoD-KO and transgenic mice over-expressing ApoD in neurons are compared to wild-type controls. In control conditions, ApoD affects the transcriptional profile of neuron and oligodendrocyte-specific genes involved in neuronal excitability, synaptic function, and myelin homeostasis. When challenged with paraquat, the absence of ApoD modifies the response of genes mainly related to OS management and myelination. Interestingly, the over-expression of ApoD in neurons almost completely abolishes the early transcriptional response to OS. We independently evaluate the expression of protein kinase C delta, a gene up-regulated by OS only in the ApoD-KO cerebellum, and find it over-expressed in cultured ApoD-KO primary astrocytes, which points to a role for ApoD in astrocyte-microglia signaling. Our results support the hypothesis that ApoD is necessary for a proper response of the nervous system against physiological and pathological OS.

Both phenomena have been studied extensively on a cellular level, but their role in sensory processing in vivo has remained elusive, due to inherent difficulties to selectively interfere with presynaptic receptors. Here, we address the contribution of a major subpopulation of GABA(A) receptors (those containing the alpha 2 subunit) to spinal pain control in mice lacking alpha 2-GABA(A) receptors specifically in primary nociceptors (sns-alpha 2(-/-) mice). sns-alpha 2(-/-) mice exhibited GABA(A) receptor currents and dorsal root potentials of normal amplitude in vitro, and normal response thresholds to thermal and mechanical stimulation in vivo, and developed normal inflammatory and neuropathic pain sensitization. However, the positive allosteric GABA(A) receptor modulator diazepam (DZP) had almost completely lost its potentiating effect on PAD and presynaptic inhibition in vitro and a major part of its spinal antihyperalgesic action against inflammatory hyperalgesia in vivo. Our results thus show that part of the antihyperalgesic action of spinally applied DZP occurs through facilitated activation of GABA(A) receptors residing on primary nociceptors.

Three-dimensional somatotopic organization and probabilistic mapping of motor responses from the human internal capsule	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						corticospinal tract; motor; brain atlas; human; electrophysiology	FUNCTIONAL NEUROSURGERY; REGISTRATION; ATLAS	Object. The somatotopic organization of the motor fibers within the posterior limb of the internal capsule (IC) in humans remains unclear. Several electrophysiological atlases created from stimulation during stereotactic neurosurgery have suggested that there is considerable overlap between representations of body parts. Overlap reported in these studies may have been due to linear sealing methods applied to the data that were unable to account for individual anatomical variability. In the current work, the authors attempted to overcome these limitations by using a nonlinear registration technique to better understand the spatial location and extent of the body-part representations in the IC. Methods. Data were acquired during 30 cases of deep brain neurosurgery in which the IC was electrically stimulated to localize the ventrolateral nucleus for a subsequent thalamotomy or implantation of a thalamic deep brain stimulator. Motor responses from the tongue, face, arm, or leg were evoked in the IC and coded in the patient's native MR imaging space. The tagged MR images were then nonlinearly registered to a high-resolution template MR image. This work resulted in a functional electrophysiological atlas demonstrating the locations of body-part representations in the posterior limb of the IC that takes individual anatomical variability into account. To further understand the spatial location and extent of the motor responses, the electrophysiological data points were transformed into 3D probability maps that describe the likelihood of obtaining motor responses in the posterior limb of the IC. Results. The analyses suggest a reliable face-anterior, arm-intermediate, and leg-posterior somatotopic organization in the posterior limb of the IC with little overlap between the body-part representations. Conclusions. This probabilistic atlas of functional responses evoked by stimulating the posterior limb of the IC provides better understanding of the anatomical organization of descending motor fibers, can be used for indirect intraoperative confirmation of the location of the ventrolateral thalamus. and is applicable to clinical and research MR imaging studies requiring information on spatial organization of motor fibers at the thalamic level in the human brain.

The qk(v) mice exhibit sterility in males and develop acquired mild hydrocephalus due to the lack of PACRG expression. To identify genetic interactors of the pacrg-parkin-qkl locus, we crossbred the qk(v) mice with various mouse strains including the patched1 (ptch1)-deficient mice. The ptch1 heterozygous mice exhibit increased Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling and are prone to several malignancies including tumorigenesis. In the present study, we show that the qk(v/v); ptch1(+/-) mice are distinguished by a dome-shaped skull at 4 to 6 weeks of age and exhibit dilation of the lateral and third ventricles leading to fatal acquired hydrocephalus by -5 months of age, unlike their littermate controls that did not develop the condition. The qk(v/v); ptch1(+/-) mice contained normal ciliated ependymal cells lining the ventricles of the brain, but these cells were functionally compromised with a severe cilial mediated flow defect. Our findings suggest that the ptch1 and the pacrg-parkin-qkl loci genetically interact to regulate cilia function of the ependymal cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the present study, the effect of acute (10 mg/kg; i.p. injection) and chronic (10 mg/kg/day; delivered by subcutaneous mini-pump) desipramine treatments on regional 5-HT synthesis were evaluated in the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL; "depressed" rats), as well as the control Flinders Resistant Line (FRL), of rats, using alpha-[(14)C]methyl-L-tryptophan autoradiography. The control rats in each of the strains received the same volume (volume in which drug was dissolved) of saline (whether through an injection or, in the case of the chronic experiments, via an osmotic mini-pump), while the treated rats received desipramine (DMI) dissolved in saline (again, as an i.p. injection or by osmotic mini-pump). The rats were randomly assigned to different groups. The results indicate that acute treatment produces a reduction in regional 5-HT synthesis in both the FSL and FRL rats, while chronic treatment produces an elevation of regional 5-HT synthesis in both strains, but the effect was somewhat greater in the FRL rats. When comparing these results to those of normal Sprague-Dawley rats, our results suggest that it is more informative to study 5-HT synthesis in an animal model of depression. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pivac, N; Diksic, M				Pivac, Nela; Diksic, Mirko			The lumped constant of alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan is not influenced by drugs acting through serotonergic system	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Lumped constant; Serotonin synthesis; Fluoxetine; D,L-Fenfluramine; Saline; Rat brain; (14)C-tryptophan; Autoradiography	RAT-BRAIN; 5-HT SYNTHESIS; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE SYNTHESIS; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION; REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; RECEPTOR-BINDING; SYNTHESIS INVIVO; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; METABOLITES; MECHANISM	Lumped constant (LC) is a constant used to convert brain trapping constant of alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan (using alpha-(14)C-methyl-L-tryptophan) into the constant for conversion of tryptophan into serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), which can be then used with certain assumptions in the calculation of the brain regional 5-HT synthesis rate. The aim of the present study was to investigate the acute effects of two drugs on the regional stability of the LC and possible effect on its value. Drugs used were a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, and a drug that releases 5-HT and inhibits 5-HT uptake, D,L-fenfluramine. The values of the LC from those experiments were compared with the value of LC obtained in the saline treated rats. KT is the constant for tryptophan conversion into 5-HT, which was measured by an autoradiographic method in more than twenty brain regions, using labelled tryptophan ((14)C-Trp) as tracer, after the fraction incorporated into proteins was removed. The trapping constant K(alpha), for alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan was also measured autoradiographically in a separate group of rats. All measurements were done in drug and saline (control) treated rats. The regional LC constants were calculated as the ratios between KT and K(alpha). Statistical evaluation showed that the regional values in each of these three sets were normally distributed, and that the three sets of LC values calculated as the mean of logarithmic differences (saline 0.450 +/- 0.055; fluoxetine 0.429 +/- 0.091; D,L-fenfluramine 0.48 +/- 0.09) did not differ significantly. The overall weighted mean value of the LC from all three sets of measurements was 0.452 +/- 0.041, and this value was not significantly different from the LC value of 0.42 +/- 0.07, i.e. value obtained in our previous studies. These results showed the unaltered LC value in discrete rat brain regions after treatment with fluoxetine or D,L-fenfluramine, and confirmed that the numerical value of the LC used in our previous studies was not altered by treatment with drugs affecting 5-HT transmission and 5-HT synthesis rate.

We conducted a PubMed search of all English-language articles with the following search terms: obesity, inflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, insulin, cognition, CNS, and neurotransmitters, cross-referenced with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. The frequent co-occurrence of mood disorders and obesity may be characterized by interconnected pathophysiology. Both conditions are marked by structural and functional abnormalities in multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions that subserve cognitive and/or affective processing. Abnormalities in several interacting biological networks (e.g. immuno-inflammatory, insulin signaling, and counterregulatory hormones) contribute to the co-occurence of mood disorders and obesity. Unequivocal evidence now indicates that obesity and mood disorders are chronic low-grade pro-inflammatory states that result in a gradual accumulation of allostatic load. Abnormalities in key effector proteins of the pro-inflammatory cascade include, but are not limited to, cytokines/adipokines such as adiponectin, leptin, and resistin as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. Taken together, the bidirectional relationship between obesity and mood disorders may represent an exophenotypic manifestation of aberrant neural and inflammatory networks. The clinical implications of these observations are that, practitioners should screen individuals with obesity for the presence of clinically significant depressive symptoms (and vice versa). This clinical recommendation is amplified in individuals presenting with biochemical indicators of insulin resistance and other concurrent conditions associated with abnormal inflammatory signaling (e.g. cardiovascular disease).

The power of Pasteur's quadrant: cardiovascular disease at the turn of the century	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Review						cardiology history; atherosclerosis; heart failure-regenerative medicine; methods of science	CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; HEART-FAILURE; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; MORTALITY; RISK; RNAS; HAEMOGLOBIN; DEVICE; DNA	During the life span of The FASEB Journal, the decline in cardiovascular mortality was astonishing as the fundamental bases of the complex syndromes of cardiovascular disease were illuminated. In this Silver Anniversary Review, we highlight a few pivotal advances in the field and relate them to research in Pasteur's quadrant, the region of investigation driven by both a desire for fundamental understanding and the consideration of its use. In the second half of the 20th century, we advanced from little pathophysiologic understanding to a near-complete understanding and effective, evidence-based therapeutics for vascular disorders and a similar development of pharmacotherapy to address heart failure, primarily through agents that antagonize the excessive concentration of circulating neurohumoral agents. In the current era, we have witnessed "the rise of the machines," from stents to cardiac resynchronization therapy. The next wave of treatments will build on an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the molecular determinants of cardiovascular disorders. We briefly consider the promise of regenerative medicine and are intrigued by the possibility for the direct reprogramming of resident cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. As for the future, genomic profiling should help physicians recommend individualized risk factor modification targeted to prevent specific manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Transcriptional and biomarker analyses will almost surely be used individually to tailor therapy for those at risk of or experiencing cardiovascular disease. Given the ongoing exponential expansion of scientific knowledge, all of human ingenuity will be needed to fully utilize the power of Pasteur's quadrant and to unleash another quarter century in cardiology as scientifically fruitful and effective on human health as the last.-Levin, R.

Trk-dependent ADAM17 activation facilitates neurotrophin survival signaling	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						p75NTR; NGF; BDNF; alpha-secretase; gamma-secretase; TrkA	NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; INTRACELLULAR DOMAIN; SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION; CONVERTING ENZYME; RECEPTOR P75(NTR); POTENTIAL ROLE; P75 RECEPTOR; PC12 CELLS	Signaling by TrkA and TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase is required for peripheral neuron survival. TrkA and TrkB signaling is facilitated by the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily, through mechanisms that remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that TrkA and TrkB induces MEK-dependent phosphorylation of the transmembrane cysteine protease ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17) at the intracellular residue threonine 735. Phosphorylation at this site activates ADAM17 and causes cleavage of p75NTR and production of the receptors' intracellular domain (p75NTR(ICD)) in PC12 cells and in primary cerebellar granule neurons. We show that Trk-induced ADAM17 phosphorylation and generation of the p75NTRICD is required for neurotrophin-induced Erk and Akt activation and for neurotrophin-dependent survival signaling. Survival of PC12 cells maintained in 10 ng/ml nerve growth factor drops by 47% in cells depleted of ADAM17; this survival deficit is resolved if the p75NTRICD is overexpressed in the ADAM17 depleted cells. These studies identify a novel signaling circuit in which Trk activates ADAM17-dependent p75NTRICD production to feedback to sustain Trk signaling and Trk-dependent survival.-Kommaddi, R.

It is important to understand the timing, progression, and extent of these abnormalities to better elucidate their potential impact on neurodevelopment, and their implications for early screening and intervention. This review synthesizes the recent literature describing neurological and neurobehavioral abnormalities observed in fetuses and newborns before cardiac surgery. A considerable proportion of newborns with complex congenital heart defects exhibit neurobehavioral and electrophysiological abnormalities preoperatively. Likewise, conventional neuroimaging studies reported that a high percentage of this population experienced brain injury. Advanced neuroimaging modalities indicated that fetuses showed delayed third trimester brain growth, and newborns showed impaired white matter maturation, reduced N-acetylaspartate, and increased lactate. These findings suggest a fetal or early postnatal onset of impaired brain growth and development. Consequently, reliable methods for early screening and subsequent developmental intervention must be implemented.

Topiramate for the Treatment of Neonatal Seizures	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article							REFRACTORY STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; INFANTILE SPASMS; TERM; CHILDREN; EFFICACY; EPILEPSY; BRAIN; TOLERABILITY; THERAPY	Therapeutic options for treating neonatal seizures, such as phenobarbital and phenytoin, lack efficacy and are potentially harmful to the developing brain. Topiramate appears effective as both an antiseizure and neuroprotective agent in animal models of newborn brain injury. Although topiramate is a common add-on agent in newborns, its use in this population has not yet been reported. We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical topiramate use in newborns with acute symptomatic seizures that were refractory to standard agents. In four of six newborns, apparent reduction or no further seizures occurred. None of the children experienced side effects resulting in discontinuation of the drug, either during the hospital admission or after discharge. Prospective studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of topiramate for both seizures and neuroprotection will be important in determining whether it deserves widespread use in clinical practice.

Incidental detection of bowel herniation with ultrasonography and fluoroscopy during a caudal block	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article							COCCYGEAL HERNIA; PERINEAL HERNIA; ULTRASOUND; REPAIR; ANATOMY	In contrast to fluoroscopy, ultrasonography allows visualization of structures such as muscles, tendons, vessels, and nerves. We describe a case where ultrasonography in conjunction with fluoroscopy led to the incidental diagnosis of bowel herniation in a patient undergoing a caudal block. A 71-yr-old woman presented to our chronic pain clinic with a long-standing history of coccydynia for which she had undergone a partial coccygectomy. A trial caudal block was planned. Fluoroscopy of the lower sacral area revealed the presence of a gas bubble inferoposteriorly to the coccygeal remnant. A confirmatory ultrasound scan revealed a hollow structure compatible with bowel. The procedure was abandoned. Subsequently, a non-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the pelvis confirmed the diagnosis of large bowel herniation. The patient was referred to a colorectal surgeon, and she subsequently underwent successful laparoscopic repair of the coccygeal hernia. Ultrasonography can be a valuable adjunct in identifying non-neural pathologies in patients undergoing interventional procedures in chronic pain management. This case report highlights the importance of being vigilant for unanticipated pathologies during ultrasound examinations while performing chronic pain block procedures.	[Dugani, Shubada; Tran, De Q.

Severity of hyperacusis predicts individual differences in speech perception in Williams Syndrome	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH			English	Article						hyperacusis; language; speech perception in noise; Williams Syndrome	METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES; DISORDERS; PHENOTYPE; TODDLERS; CHILDREN; AUTISM; MEMORY; NOISE	Background Williams Syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder of genetic origin, characterised by relative proficiency in language in the face of serious impairment in several other domains. Individuals with WS display an unusual sensitivity to noise, known as hyperacusis. Methods In this study, we examined the extent to which hyperacusis interferes with the perception of speech in children and adults with WS. Participants were required to discriminate words which differed in one consonant of a cluster when these contrasts were embedded in a background of noise. Results Although the introduction of noise interfered with performance on a consonant cluster discrimination task equally in the WS and control groups, the severity of hyperacusis significantly predicted individual variability in speech perception within the WS group. Conclusions These results suggest that alterations in sensitivity to input mediate atypical pathways for language development in WS, where hyperacusis exerts an important influence together with other non-auditory factors.

The present hypothesis was that neuroticism predicts subjective status and does so via the influence of neuroticism on objective status (i.e., education, occupation, and income), self-perceived illness, and greater negative affect. In turn, lower subjective status would be associated with more severe self-perceived illness. Older adults (N=341) shortly after retirement completed measures of neuroticism, attainment in education, occupation, and salary, and over 2 subsequent years, they completed measures of current subjective status, self-reported illness, and current negative affect. As hypothesized, greater neuroticism was associated with lower subjective status via lower objective status and more severe self-reported illness. However, current negative affect was not associated with subjective status, and subjective status did not predict future poorer subjective health.

Distribution of collateral fibers in the monkey cervical spinal cord detected with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						DTI; PAS; Spinal cord; Collaterals; Crossing fibers	C3-C4 PROPRIOSPINAL SYSTEM; MOTOR CONTROL; Q-SPACE; TENSOR; MRI; TRACKING; TISSUE; BRAIN; TRACTOGRAPHY; STRATEGIES	Diffusion anisotropy monitored with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) is a sensitive marker to monitor developmental or pathological microstructural changes in spinal cord. The white matter is often treated as a unidirectional axonal bundle but collateral fibers branching off the main spinal pathways contradicts this assumption and affects the diffusion anisotropy. It is the aim of this study to investigate to what extent collateral fibers are apparent in diffusion tensor data and if collaterals can be detected as individual fiber directions using crossing fiber detection techniques. We calculate the diffusion tensor and the persistent angular structure (PAS), a multi-fiber reconstruction technique, from high quality post mortem data of a perfusion-fixed vervet monkey cervical spinal cord sample and simulated crossing fiber data. Our results show that (i) cylindrical geometry in the white matter of the spinal cord is an invalid assumption due to collateral fibers. We also demonstrate that (ii) collateral fibers can be resolved as distinct peaks in the water diffusion propagator in white matter using multi-fiber models. Finally, we show that (iii) crossing fibers are mainly located laterally and increase towards the cervical enlargement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

When comparing SCT to histological cortical thickness maps, a good correspondence can be found for many but not all human brain areas. Discrepancies especially arise in the sensory motor cortex, where histological cortical thickness is high, but SCT is very low. The aim of this study was to determine whether the relationship between cortical thickness and neuronal density is the same for different cytoarchitectonic areas throughout homo- and heterotypical isocortex. We assessed this relationship using high-resolution [F-18]-labelled flumazenil (FMZ) PET and SCT-mapping. FMZ binds to the benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor complex which is localized on axo-dendritic synapses, with a cortical distribution closely following the local density of neurons. SCT and voxelwise FMZ binding potential (BPND) were assessed in ten healthy subjects. After partial volume correction, two subsets with a differential relationship between SCT and BPND were identified: a fronto-parietal homotypical subset where neuronal density is relatively constant and mainly independent of SCT, and a subset comprising heterotypical and mainly temporal and occipital homotypical regions where neuronal density is negatively correlated with SCT. This is the first in-vivo study demonstrating a differential relationship between SCT. neuronal density and cytoarchitectonics in humans. These findings are of direct relevance for the correct interpretation of SCT-based morphometry studies, in that there is no simple relationship between apparent cortical thickness and neuronal density, here attributed to FMZ binding, holding for all cortical regions.

The left fusiform gyrus hosts trisensory representations of manipulable objects	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multisensory processing; Object recognition; Auditory perception; Touch perception; Visual perception; fMRI	SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; NEURAL SYSTEMS; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTEX; FMRI; CONVERGENCE; ACTIVATION; RECOGNITION	During object manipulation the brain integrates the visual, auditory, and haptic experience of an object into a unified percept. Previous brain imaging studies have implicated for instance the dorsal part of the lateral occipital complex ill visuo-tactile and the posterior superior temporal sulcus in audio-visual integration of object-related inputs (Amedi et al., 2005). Yet it is still unclear which brain regions represent object-specific information of all three sensory modalities. To address this question, we performed two complementary functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments. In the first experiment, we identified brain regions which were consistently activated by unimodal visual, auditory, and haptic processing of manipulable objects relative to non-object control stimuli presented in the same modality. In the second experiment, we assessed regional brain activations when participants had to match object-related information that was presented simultaneously in two or all three modalities. Only a well-defined region in left fusiform gyrus (FG) showed an object-specific activation during unisensory processing in the visual, auditory, and tactile modalities. The same region was also consistently activated during multisensory matching of object-related information across all three senses. Taken together, our results suggest that this region is central to the recognition of manipulable objects. A putative role of this K.; region is to unify object-specific information provided by the visual, auditory, and tactile modalities into trisensory object representations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Using a 60-channel perforated multi-electrode array (pMEA) on corticohippocampal slices from 2 to 3 week old mice we recorded interictal- and ictal-like events. When glutamatergic transmission was blocked, interictal-like events no longer initiated in the hilus or CA3/CA1 pyramidal layers but originated from the dentate gyrus granule and molecular layers. Furthermore, frequencies of interictal-like events were reduced and durations were increased in these regions while cortical discharges were completely blocked. Following GABA(A) receptor blockade interictal-like events no longer propagated to the dentate gyrus while their frequency in CA3 increased; in addition, ictal-like cortical events became shorter while increasing in frequency. Lastly, drugs that affect tonic and synaptic GABAergic conductance modulated the frequency, duration, initiation and propagation of interictal-like events. These findings confirm and expand on previous studies indicating that multiple synaptic mechanisms contribute to synchronize neuronal network activity in forebrain structures.

J	Becker, S; Kleinbohl, D; Baus, D; Holzl, R				Becker, Susanne; Kleinboehl, Dieter; Baus, Dagmar; Hoelzl, Rupert			Operant learning of perceptual sensitization and habituation is impaired in fibromyalgia patients with and without irritable bowel syndrome	PAIN			English	Article						Operant learning; Sensitization; Chronic pain; Fibromyalgia; Irritable bowel syndrome; Behavioral psychology	CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS; FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS; NOXIOUS HEAT STIMULI; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; DECISION-MAKING; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HEALTHY CONTROLS; MUSCLE TENSION; HYPERALGESIA; MONKEY	The important role of operant learning in the development and maintenance of chronic pain is widely recognized. A specific type of reinforcement based on the reduction of painful stimulation when a person's perception changes in the desired direction has been termed intrinsic reinforcement of pain. In the present study, the role of intrinsic operant learning in chronic pain was tested in fibromyalgia (FM) patients with and without comorbid irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared with healthy persons. A previously established operant learning task was used to enhance perceptual sensitization or habituation through intrinsic reinforcement. In addition to subjective pain ratings, pain sensitivity was implicitly measured by a behavioral discrimination task. In accordance with the operant learning task, healthy participants learned enhanced perceptual sensitization and habituation, depending on the experimental condition. Whereas healthy persons learned perceptual changes according the experimental protocol, both patient groups failed to show normal operant perceptual learning: FM patients without IBS demonstrated sensitization learning comparable to that in healthy persons, but unexpectedly these patients learned even more pronounced sensitization in the habituation learning condition, contradicting the experimental protocol; FM patients with IBS demonstrated neither learning of enhanced sensitization nor enhanced habituation; no signs of differential operant learning were observable. Thus, operant perceptual learning was impaired in FM patients; whether learning of both enhanced perceptual sensitization and habituation was impaired depended on the presence of comorbid IBS and could not be explained by other clinical characteristics of the patients such as pain threshold, duration of pain, depressive symptoms, or anxiety.

Repetition-induced activity-related summation of pain in patients with fibromyalgia	PAIN			English	Article						Fibromyalgia; Low back pain; Summation of pain; Disability; Fear of pain	LOW-BACK-PAIN; TEMPORAL SUMMATION; 2ND PAIN; DISABILITY INDEX; THERMAL PAIN; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; TAMPA SCALE; MUSCLE PAIN; EXERCISE; FEAR	This study compared individuals with fibromyalgia (FM) and individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP) on repetition-induced summation of activity-related pain (RISP). Fear of movement, pain catastrophizing and depression were examined as potential mediators of group differences. The sample consisted of 50 women with FM and 50 women with CLBP who were matched on age, pain severity and pain duration. Participants were asked to lift a series of 18 weighted canisters. In one trial, participants were asked to rate their pain after each lift. In a second trial, participants estimated the weight of each of the canisters. An index of repetition-induced summation of pain was derived as the change in pain ratings across repeated lifts. Analyses revealed that women with FM obtained higher scores on the index of RISP than women with CLBP. The heightened sensitivity to RISP in individuals with FM was not due to generalized hyperalgesia or a greater work output. Consistent with previous research, fear of movement was positively correlated with RISP. Pain disability was also associated with greater RISP, but not pain catastrophizing or depression. Discussion addresses the processes by which individuals with FM might have increased RISP responses. The findings of this study point to possible neurophysiological mechanisms that could help explain the high levels of pain-related disability seen in individuals with FM.

Genome-Wide Association Studies of Cerebral White Matter Lesion Burden: The CHARGE Consortium	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HYPERINTENSITY VOLUME; HYPERTENSIVE SIBSHIPS; GENE-EXPRESSION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; LEUKOARAIOSIS; DISEASE; PROTEIN; LOCI; HEART; SCANS	Objective: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) detectable by magnetic resonance imaging are part of the spectrum of vascular injury associated with aging of the brain and are thought to reflect ischemic damage to the small deep cerebral vessels. WMHs are associated with an increased risk of cognitive and motor dysfunction, dementia, depression, and stroke. Despite a significant heritability, few genetic loci influencing WMH burden have been identified. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for WMH burden in 9,361 stroke-free individuals of European descent from 7 community-based cohorts. Significant findings were tested for replication in 3,024 individuals from 2 additional cohorts. Results: We identified 6 novel risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1 locus on chromosome 17q25 encompassing 6 known genes including WBP2, TRIM65, TRIM47, MRPL38, FBF1, and ACOX1. The most significant association was for rs3744028 (p(discovery) = 4.0 x 10(-9); p(replication) = 1.3 x 10(-7); p(combined) = 4.0 x 10(-15)). Other SNPs in this region also reaching genome-wide significance were rs9894383 (p = 5.3 x 10(-9)), rs11869977 (p = 5.7 x 10(-9)), rs936393 (p = 6.8 x 10(-9)), rs3744017 (p = 7.3 x 10(-9)), and rs1055129 (p = 4.1 x 10(-8)). Variant alleles at these loci conferred a small increase in WMH burden (4-8% of the overall mean WMH burden in the sample). Interpretation: This large GWAS of WMH burden in community-based cohorts of individuals of European descent identifies a novel locus on chromosome 17. Further characterization of this locus may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cerebral WMH.

In a rat model of optic nerve transection, in which 80% of RGCs are eliminated within 14 days, caspase-2 was found to be expressed and cleaved (activated) predominantly in RGC. Inhibition of caspase-2 expression by a chemically modified synthetic short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) delivered by intravitreal administration significantly enhanced RGC survival over a period of at least 30 days. This exogenously delivered siRNA could be found in RGC and other types of retinal cells, persisted inside the retina for at least 1 month and mediated sequence-specific RNA interference without inducing an interferon response. Our results indicate that RGC apoptosis induced by optic nerve injury involves activation of caspase-2, and that synthetic siRNAs designed to inhibit expression of caspase-2 represent potential neuroprotective agents for intervention in human diseases involving RGC loss.

Background: Recognition of familiar music depends on several levels of processing. There are few studies about how patients with dementia recognize familiar music. Methods: Subjects were administered tasks that assess pitch and melody discrimination, detection of pitch errors in familiar melodies, and naming of familiar melodies. Results: There were no group differences on pitch and melody discrimination tasks. However, patients with semantic dementia had considerable difficulty naming familiar melodies and also scored the lowest when asked to identify pitch errors in the same melodies. Naming familiar melodies, but not other music tasks, was strongly related to measures of semantic memory. Voxel-based morphometry analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging showed that difficulty in naming songs was associated with the bilateral temporal lobes and inferior frontal gyrus, whereas difficulty in identifying pitch errors in familiar melodies correlated with primarily the right temporal lobe. Conclusions: The results support a view that the anterior temporal lobes play a role in familiar melody recognition, and that musical functions are affected differentially across forms of dementia.

Previous studies have shown that similar changes in astrocytic proteins can signal changes in local synapses and dendritic spines. Thus, here we used the Golgi-Cox impregnation technique to compare spine density in layer 2 and 3 pyramidal cells of Cg2, the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the parietal cortex (ParCx) among metestrus, late pregnant (LP), 3-hour postpartum (3H PP) and 16-day postpartum rats (016 PP). Rats in the 3H PP group had higher numbers of dendritic spines/10 mu m on the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in both Cg2 and CA1 than the other groups, which did not differ. A similar pattern was observed in basilar dendrites but this failed to reach significance. In Cg2, Sholl analysis revealed that rats in the D16 PP group had a significantly greater extent of dendritic arborization in the basilar region than any other group. These data suggest that the changes in astrocytic proteins that occur in Cg2 in the postpartum period are associated with neuronal plasticity in pyramidal layers 2 and 3. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

At a neural level, it is associated with abnormalities of the areas of the neural system that process threatening information, including the amygdala and medial-prefrontal cortex, as well as of that involved in episodic memory, including the hippocampus. However, little is known about how the function of these regions may change as one recovers from the disorder. In this investigation. PTSD patients underwent two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, 6-9 months apart, while viewing fearful and neutral faces in preparation for a memory test (administered outside the scanner). At Time 2,65% of patients were in remission. Current symptom levels correlated positively with memory-related fMRI activity in the amygdala and ventral-medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). In addition, the change in activity within the hippocampus and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) was associated with the degree of symptom improvement (n = 18). These results suggest differential involvement of structures within the fear network in symptom manifestation and in recovery from PTSD: whereas activity within the amygdala and vmPFC appeared to be a marker of current symptom severity, functional changes in the hippocampus and sgACC reflected recovery. These results underscore the importance of longitudinal investigations for the identification of the differential neural structures associated with the expression and remission of anxiety disorders.

Two anterior patients could not correct their errors in a unilateral version of a visuomotor learning task for which they previously exhibited callosal disconnection, whereas, they corrected most of their errors in two visual matching tasks (comparing abstract shapes or faces) that they could transfer between the hemispheres. An opposite pattern emerged in a posterior patient. He could not correct his errors in unilateral versions of the same visual matching tasks, for which he previously exhibited callosal disconnection. However, he corrected most of his errors in the visuomotor learning task he was able to transfer between the hemispheres. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the origin of hemispheric specialization remains controversial. Some authors posit that language lateralization is genetically determined, while others have suggested that hemispheric specialization develops with age. Tenants of the latter view have further suggested that the adult pattern of left hemispheric specialization is achieved by means of callosal inhibition of homologous speech areas in the right hemisphere during ontogeny. According to this hypothesis, one would expect language to develop bilaterally in the acallosal brain. A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in one patient with agenesis of the corpus callosum suggests that this might indeed be the case (Riecker et al., 2007). However, given the large anatomic and functional variability in the population of subjects with agenesis of the corpus callosum, this finding needs to be more extensively replicated. In the present study, we explored language lateralization in six individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum using an fMRI protocol which included a syntactic decision task and a sub-vocal verbal fluency task. Two neurologically intact control groups, one comparable to the acallosals in terms of IQ age and education (n = 6) and one group with a high IQ (n = 5), performed the same tasks. No differences were found between language lateralization of the subjects with agenesis of the corpus callosum and the control groups in the receptive speech task. However, for expressive speech, the groups differed with respect to frontal activations, with the acallosal participants showing a more bilateral pattern of activation than the high-IQ participants only. No differences were found for temporal regions. Overall, these results indicate that the corpus callosum is not essential for the establishment of lateralized language functions.

Neural correlates of olfactory processing in congenital blindness	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Blindness; Olfaction; Cross-modal plasticity; Behavior; fMRI	ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; ODOR IDENTIFICATION; STIMULATION; FMRI; PERCEPTION; PLASTICITY; MEMORY; REPRESENTATIONS; CONNECTIONS; RESPONSES	Adaptive neuroplastic changes have been well documented in congenitally blind individuals for the processing of tactile and auditory information. By contrast, very few studies have investigated olfactory processing in the absence of vision. There is ample evidence that the olfactory system is highly plastic and that blind individuals rely more on their sense of smell than the sighted do. The olfactory system in the blind is therefore likely to be susceptible to cross-modal changes similar to those observed for the tactile and auditory modalities. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure changes in the blood-oxygenation level-dependent signal in congenitally blind and blindfolded sighted control subjects during a simple odor detection task. We found several group differences in task-related activations. Compared to sighted controls, congenitally blind subjects more strongly activated primary (right amygdala) and secondary (right orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral hippocampus) olfactory areas. In addition, widespread task-related activations were found throughout the whole extent of the occipital cortex in blind but not in sighted participants. The stronger recruitment of the occipital cortex during odor detection demonstrates a preferential access of olfactory stimuli to this area when vision is lacking from birth. This finding expands current knowledge about the supramodal function of the visually deprived occipital cortex in congenital blindness, linking it also to olfactory processing in addition to tactile and auditory processing.

The processing capacity and throughput of information at individual brain regions remains an open question and one that could potentially bridge these two aspects of neural organization. The rate at which information is emitted from different nodes in the network and how this output process changes under different external conditions are general questions that are not unique to neuroscience, but are of interest in multiple classes of telecommunication networks. In the present study we show how some of these questions may be addressed using tools from telecommunications research. An important system statistic for modeling and performance evaluation of distributed communication systems is the time between successive departures of units of information at each node in the network. We describe a method to extract and fully characterize the distribution of such inter-departure times from the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG). We show that inter-departure times are well fitted by the two-parameter Gamma distribution. Moreover, they are not spatially or neurophysiologically trivial and instead are regionally specific and sensitive to the presence of sensory input. In both the eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions, inter-departure time distributions were more dispersed over posterior parietal channels, close to regions which are known to have the most dense structural connectivity. The biggest differences between the two conditions were observed at occipital sites, where inter-departure times were significantly more variable in the eyes-open condition. Together, these results suggest that message departure times are indicative of network traffic and capture a novel facet of neural activity.

However, many patients with advanced dementia sustain aggressive interventions that do not improve their survival and might hinder their comfort and quality of life. This is likely explained by a lack of research on this population; a lack of knowledge from health care providers, patients, and family members; and lack of communication between those caring for these patients. There is therefore an urgent need for research and education on this topic, as well as palliative care services devoted to this population.

To identify potential biomarkers of response, we investigated peripheral gene expression patterns of response to antidepressant treatment in MDD. We did this using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus2 microarrays in blood samples, from untreated individuals with MDD (N=63) ascertained at a community outpatient clinic, pre and post 8-week treatment with citalopram, and used a regression model to assess the impact of gene expression differences on antidepressant response. We carried out technical validation of significant probesets by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and conducted central nervous system follow-up of the most significant result in post-mortem brain samples from 15 subjects who died during a current MDD episode and 11 sudden-death controls. A total of 32 probesets were differentially expressed according to response to citalopram treatment following false discovery rate correction. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) was the most significant differentially expressed gene and its expression was upregulated by citalopram treatment in individuals who responded to treatment. We found these results to be concordant with our observation of decreased expression of IRF7 in the prefrontal cortex of MDDs with negative toxicological evidence for antidepressant treatment at the time of death. These findings point to IRF7 as a gene of interest in studies investigating genomic factors associated with antidepressant response.

Stimuli were abstract meaningless figures that were either complete or fragmented to various extents but still recoverable. Stimuli were first encoded as part of a symmetry discrimination task. In a subsequent recognition phase, encoded stimuli were presented complete along with never presented stimuli and participants performed an old/new discrimination task. Fragmentation stimuli elicited more negative ERPs than complete figures over the frontal, central and parietal areas between 180 and 260 ms, and over the occipito-temporal areas between 220 and 340 ms. Only this latter effect was modulated as a function of whether stimuli were recognized or not during the recognition phase of the memory test. More specifically, the effect occurred for stimuli that were later forgotten and was absent for stimuli that were later recognized. This ERP to fragmentation, the occipito-temporal N-frag, possibly reflects the brain response to encoding difficulty, and is thus predictive of recognition performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Subsequent findings have demonstrated that netrins can influence the formation of multiple tissues, including the vasculature, lung, pancreas, muscle and mammary gland, by mediating cell migration, cell-cell interactions and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. Recent evidence also implicates the ongoing expression of netrins and netrin receptors in the maintenance of cell-cell organisation in mature tissues. Here, we review the mechanisms involved in netrin signalling in vertebrate and invertebrate systems and discuss the functions of netrin signalling during the development of neural and non-neural tissues.

Targeting the anaphase promoting complex: common pathways for viral infection and cancer therapy	EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC TARGETS			English	Review						anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C); anti-mitotic therapy; apoptosis; Cdc20; Cdh1; mitotic slippage; viral proteins	HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS-INFECTION; SPINDLE ASSEMBLY CHECKPOINT; CELL-CYCLE REGULATOR; S-PHASE ENTRY; UBIQUITIN LIGASE; POSTMITOTIC NEURONS; MITOTIC CHECKPOINT; COHESIN CLEAVAGE; DESTRUCTION BOX; PROTEIN APOPTIN	Introduction: The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a ubiquitin ligase involved in regulation of the cell cycle through ubiquitination-dependent substrate proteolysis. Many viral proteins have been shown to interact with the APC/C, derailing cell cycle progression in order to facilitate their own replication. Induction of G(2)/M arrest by viral APC/C inhibition can lead to apoptotic cell death. Some viral proteins cause cytotoxicity specifically in tumour cells, providing evidence that targeting the APC/C could be exploited to selectively eliminate cancer cells. Areas covered: In this review, we provide a summary of studies from viral APC/C interactions over the last decade, as well as recent discoveries identifying the APC/C as a promising target in the context of cancer therapy. Expert opinion: Current therapeutic strategies inducing mitotic arrest rely on activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) for their function. Many cancer cells have a weakened SAC and escape apoptosis through mitotic slippage. Recent evidence has demonstrated that targeting the APC/C, particularly the co-activator Cdc20, might be a better alternative. Tumour cells display greater dependency on APC/C function than normal cells and oncogenic transformation can lead to increased mitotic stress, rendering cancer cells more vulnerable to APC/C inhibition.

Constrained Principal Component Analysis Reveals Functionally Connected Load-Dependent Networks Involved in Multiple Stages of Working Memory	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						working memory; fMRI; principal component analysis	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN; MAINTENANCE; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION; CAPACITY	Constrained principal component analysis (CPCA) with a finite impulse response (FIR) basis set was used to reveal functionally connected networks and their temporal progression over a multi-stage verbal working memory trial in which memory load was varied. Four components were extracted, and all showed statistically significant sensitivity to the memory load manipulation. Additionally, two of the four components sustained this peak activity, both for approximately 3 s (Components 1 and 4). The functional networks that showed sustained activity were characterized by increased activations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left supramarginal gyrus, and decreased activations in the primary auditory cortex and "default network" regions. The functional networks that did not show sustained activity were instead dominated by increased activation in occipital cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, sensori-motor cortical regions, and superior parietal cortex. The response shapes suggest that although all four components appear to be invoked at encoding, the two sustained-peak components are likely to be additionally involved in the delay period. Our investigation provides a unique view of the contributions made by a network of brain regions over the course of a multiple-stage working memory trial. Hum Brain Mapp 32:856-871, 2011.

Systemic Lupus Int Collaborating C	SF-36 summary and subscale scores are reliable outcomes of neuropsychiatric events in systemic lupus erythematosus	ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES			English	Article							QUALITY-OF-LIFE; INTERNATIONAL INCEPTION COHORT; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; INTRAVENOUS CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE; PREVALENCE; INDEX; CORTICOSTEROIDS; MANIFESTATIONS; VALIDATION; DIAGNOSIS	Objective To examine change in health-related quality of life in association with clinical outcomes of neuropsychiatric events in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods An international study evaluated newly diagnosed SLE patients for neuropsychiatric events attributed to SLE and non-SLE causes. The outcome of events was determined by a physician-completed seven-point scale and compared with patient-completed Short Form 36 (SF-36) health survey questionnaires. Statistical analysis used linear mixed-effects regression models with patient-specific random effects. Results 274 patients (92% female; 68% Caucasian), from a cohort of 1400, had one or more neuropsychiatric event in which the interval between assessments was 12.3+/-2 months. The overall difference in change between visits in mental component summary (MCS) scores of the SF-36 was significant (p<0.0001) following adjustments for gender, ethnicity, centre and previous score. A consistent improvement in neuropsychiatric status (N=295) was associated with an increase in the mean (SD) adjusted MCS score of 3.66 (0.89) in SF-36 scores. Between paired visits when the neuropsychiatric status consistently deteriorated (N=30), the adjusted MCS score decreased by 4.00 (1.96). For the physical component summary scores the corresponding changes were + 1.73 (0.71) and -0.62 (1.58) (p<0.05), respectively. Changes in SF-36 subscales were in the same direction (p<0.05; with the exception of role physical). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. Adjustment for age, education, medications, SLE disease activity, organ damage, disease duration, attribution and characteristics of neuropsychiatric events did not substantially alter the results. Conclusion Changes in SF-36 summary and subscale scores, in particular those related to mental health, are strongly associated with the clinical outcome of neuropsychiatric events in SLE patients.

Methods A population-based cohort study was carried out using administrative health data on 7051 individuals with RA onset between 1997 and 2001 and no exposure to GC before RA onset. Follow-up was until 2006. GC exposure was defined in four ways: current use (yes/no), current dose (mg/day), cumulative dose (grams) and cumulative duration of use (years). All were used as time-dependent variables updated monthly. CVA were ascertained using hospitalisation and vital statistics data. Transient ischaemic attacks were not considered as CVA. Cox regression models adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular drug use, propensity scores and RA characteristics were used. Results The mean age of the cohort was 56 years and 66% were women. Over 6 years' mean follow-up (43 355 person-years), 178 incident CVA cases were identified. GC current use was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of CVA (HR=1.41, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.37). Similarly, the models that accounted for daily dose (HR=1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.21 for each 5 mg increase in the daily dose), cumulative duration of use (HR=1.1, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32 for each year accumulated in the past) and total cumulative dose (HR=1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08 per gram accumulated in the past) were also not significantly associated with CVA. Conclusions This large population-based study indicates that GC use is not associated with an increased risk of CVA in cases with RA.	[Avina-Zubieta, J. Antonio; Choi, Hyon K.; Rahman, M.

Given the extensive regulation of genes involved in polyamine metabolism, as well as their interconnections with the metabolism of other amino acids, we were interested in further investigating the expression of polyamine-related genes across the brain in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of the dysregulation of this system in suicide. To this end, we examined the expression of genes related to polyamine metabolism across 22 brain regions in a sample of 29 mood-disordered suicide completers and 16 controls, and identified 14 genes displaying differential expression. Among these, altered expression of spermidine/spermine N-1-acetyltransferase, spermine oxidase, and spermine synthase, has previously been observed in brains of suicide completers, while the remainder of the genes represent novel findings. In addition to genes with direct involvement in polyamine metabolism, including S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase antizymes 1 and 2, and arginase II, we identified altered expression of several more distally related genes, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family, member A2, brain creatine kinase, mitochondrial creatine kinase 1, glycine amidinotransferase, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1, and arginyl-tRNA synthetase-like. Many of these genes displayed altered expression across several brain regions, strongly implying that dysregulated polyamine metabolism is a widespread phenomenon in the brains of suicide completers. This study provides a broader view of the nature and extent of the dysregulation of the polyamine system in suicide, and highlights the importance of this system in the neurobiology of suicide.

In this study we investigated the hypothesis that placental ischemia in pregnant rat, a model of preeclampsia, stimulates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis via a TNF-alpha-dependent mechanism. Methods Normal pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats and RUPP rats were evaluated on day 19 of gestation. To test the role of TNF-alpha in mediating change in the RUPP rat heart, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, etanercept, was administered on day 18 of gestation at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg, s.c. Results In comparison to normal pregnant rats, RUPP animals display enlarged cardiomyocytes, microvascular rarefaction, fibrosis, apoptosis as well as increased expression of markers of heart hypertrophy and fibrosis. Etanercept (E) treatment prevented enlargement of cardiomyocytes, fibrosis and apoptosis and this was accompanied by significantly lowered blood pressure in RUPP rats. Etanercept treatment lowered expression of mRNA for brain natriuretic peptide, a marker of cardiac hypertrophy. It also heightened expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and its phosphorylation as well as oxytocin receptor identified in cardiac microvessels. TNF-alpha inhibition prevented microvascular rarefaction in the heart as indicated by augmented CD31, a marker of angiogenesis. Conclusions These results suggest that RUPP leads to microvascular rarefaction in the heart, exaggerated cardiomyocyte size, apoptosis, fibrosis, and the alteration of cardiac gene expression that are modulated by the inflammatory cytokine TNF alpha.

LTF requires translational control downstream of target of rapamycin complex 1. Our lab has previously shown that treatment with the facilitating neurotransmitter, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), causes a target of rapamycin complex 1-mediated decrease in phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) within the neurites of sensory neurons involved in LTF. Here, we characterize the Aplysia orthologue of eEF2 kinase (eEF2K). We show that the Aplysia eEF2K orthologue contains an S6 kinase phosphorylation site and that a serine-to-alanine mutation at this site blocks the ability of 5-HT to decrease eEF2 phosphorylation in neurites. We also show that within the soma, 5-HT has the opposite effect, decreasing eEF2K phosphorylation at the S6 kinase site and, concomitantly, increasing eEF2 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, while eEF2K over-expression inhibits translation of a marker for internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation, it stimulates the translation of a marker for cap-dependent translation. This study demonstrates that eEF2 is differentially regulated in separate compartments and contributes to a growing body of evidence that inhibition of elongation can stimulate the translation of certain transcripts.

Materials and Methods: In a prospective, double-blind, multicenter study 57 patients 18 to 75 years old with neurogenic detrusor overactivity secondary to spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis and urinary incontinence (defined as 1 or more occurrences daily) despite current antimuscarinic treatment were randomized to onabotulinumtoxinA 300 U (28) or placebo (29) via cystoscopic injection at 30 intradetrusor sites, sparing the trigone. Patients were offered open label onabotulinumtoxinA 300 U at week 36 and followed a further 6 months while 24 each in the treatment and placebo groups received open label therapy. The primary efficacy parameter was daily urinary incontinence frequency on 3-day voiding diary at week 6. Secondary parameters were changes in the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire and the urinary incontinence quality of life scale at week 6. Diary and quality of life evaluations were also done after open label treatment. Results: The mean daily frequency of urinary incontinence episodes was significantly lower for onabotulinumtoxinA than for placebo at week 6 (1.31 vs 4.76, p <0.0001), and for weeks 24 and 36. Improved urodynamic and quality of life parameters for treatment vs placebo were evident at week 6 and persisted to weeks 24 to 36. The most common adverse event in each group was urinary tract infection. Conclusions: In adults with antimuscarinic refractory neurogenic detrusor overactivity and multiple sclerosis onabotulinumtoxinA is well tolerated and provides clinically beneficial improvement for up to 9 months.

They are clearly identifiable by their unique morphology, having a periventricular cell soma and a long process extending all the way to the opposite pial surface. Due to this striking morphology, RG have long been thought of as a transient substrate for neuron migration in the developing brain. In fact, RG cells, far from exclusively serving as a passive scaffold for cell migration, have a remarkably diverse range of critical functions in CNS development and function. These include serving as progenitors of neurons and glia both during development as well as in response to injury, helping to direct axonal and dendritic process outgrowth, and regulating synaptic development and function. RG also engage in extensive bidirectional signaling both with neurons and one another. This review describes the diversity of RG cell types in the CNS and discusses their many important activities.

Here, we analyzed the temporal and spatial evolution of interictal spikes with and without HFOs in the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Depth electrode recordings from dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 region, subiculum and entorhinal cortex (EC), were obtained from rats between the 4th and 15th day after a status epilepticus (SE) induced by i.p. injection of pilocarpine. The first seizure occurred 6.1 +/- 2.5 days after SE (n = 7 rats). Five of 7 animals exhibited interictal spikes that co-occurred with fast ripples accounting for 4.9 +/- 4.6% of all analyzed interictal spikes (n = 12,886) while all rats showed interictal spikes co-occurring with ripples, accounting for 14.3 +/- 3.4% of all events. Increased rates of interictal spikes without HFOs in the EC predicted upcoming seizures on the following day, while rates of interictal spikes with fast ripples in CA3 reflected periods of high seizure occurrence. Finally, interictal spikes co-occurring with ripples did not show any specific relation to seizure occurrence. Our findings identify different temporal and spatial developmental patterns for the rates of interictal spikes with or without HFOs in relation with seizure occurrence. These distinct categories of interictal spikes point at dynamic processes that should bring neuronal networks close to seizure generation. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial pathology and protein aggregation in a culture model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Mechanistic relationship and differential sensitivity to intervention	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); Calcium; Motor neuron; Mitochondria; Proteasome; SOD1; Aggregation; Inclusions	SKELETAL-MUSCLE; DEATH; SOD1	The combination of Ca(2+) influx during neurotransmission and low cytosolic Ca(2+) buffering contributes to the preferential vulnerability of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This study investigated the relationship among Ca(2+) accumulation in intracellular compartments, mitochondrial abnormalities, and protein aggregation in a model of familial ALS (fALS1). Human SOD1, wild type (SOD1(WT)) or with the ALS-causing mutation G93A (SOD1(G93A)), was expressed in motor neurons of dissociated murine spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures. Elevation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](m)), decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi) and rounding of mitochondria occurred early, followed by increased endoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](ER)), elevated cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](c)), and subsequent appearance of SOD1(G93A) inclusions (a consequence of protein aggregation). [Ca(2+)](c) was elevated to a greater extent in neurons with inclusions than in those with diffusely distributed SOD1(G93A) and promoted aggregation of mutant protein, not vice versa: both [Ca(2+)](c) and the percentage of neurons with SOD1(G93A) inclusions were reduced by co-expressing the cytosolic Ca(2+)-buffering protein, calbindin D-28K; treatment with the heat shock protein inducer, geldanamycin, prevented inclusions but not the increase in [Ca(2+)](c), [Ca(2+)](m), or loss of Delta psi, and inhibiting proteasome activity with epoxomicin, known to promote aggregation of disease-causing mutant proteins including SOD1(G93A), had no effect on Ca(2+) levels. Both expression of SOD1(G93A) and epoxomicin-induced inhibition of proteasome activity caused mitochondrial rounding, independent of Ca(2+) dysregulation and reduced Delta psi. That geldanamycin prevented inclusions and mitochondrial rounding, but not Ca(2+) dysregulation or loss of Delta psi indicates that chaperone-based therapies to prevent protein aggregation may require co-therapy to address these other underlying mechanisms of toxicity.

The P22S mutation of the NEFL gene encoding the light polypeptide neurofilament (NFL) is associated with CMT. To understand more clearly the pathogenesis of sensorimotor dysfunction in CMT, we generated transgenic mice with the NEFLP22S mutation under the tet-off tetracycline regulated system with involvement of the Thy1 neuron-specific promoter. NEFLP22S transgenic mice exhibited extended duration of the hindlimb clasping response and gait anomalies, as well as sensorimotor deficits in stationary beam and suspended bar tests.

T1-weighted (anatomical) magnetic resonance images (MRI) provide excellent contrast between soft tissues. Given its three-dimensional nature, MRI represents an ideal imaging modality for the analysis of craniofacial structure in living individuals. Here we describe how T1-weighted MR images, acquired to examine brain anatomy, can also be used to analyze facial features. Using a sample of typically developing adolescents from the Saguenay Youth Study (N = 597; 292 male, 305 female, ages: 12 to 18 years), we quantified inter-individual variations in craniofacial structure in two ways. First, we adapted existing nonlinear registration-based morphological techniques to generate iteratively a group-wise population average of craniofacial features. The nonlinear transformations were used to map the craniofacial structure of each individual to the population average. Using voxel-wise measures of expansion and contraction, we then examined the effects of sex and age on inter-individual variations in facial features. Second, we employed a landmark-based approach to quantify variations in face surfaces. This approach involves: (a) placing 56 landmarks (forehead, nose, lips, jaw-line, cheekbones, and eyes) on a surface representation of the MRI-based group average; (b) warping the landmarks to the individual faces using the inverse nonlinear transformation estimated for each person; and (3) using a principal components analysis (PCA) of the warped landmarks to identify facial features (i. e. clusters of landmarks) that vary in our sample in a correlated fashion. As with the voxel-wise analysis of the deformation fields, we examined the effects of sex and age on the PCA-derived spatial relationships between facial features. Both methods demonstrated significant sexual dimorphism in craniofacial structure in areas such as the chin, mandible, lips, and nose.	[Chakravarty, M.

It was found to be necessary for cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Specific inhibition of h-eag1 expression leads to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. We report here that h-eag1 expression is controlled by the p53-miR-34-E2F1 pathway through a negative feed-forward mechanism. We first established E2F1 as a transactivator of h-eag1 gene through characterizing its promoter region. We then revealed that miR-34, a known transcriptional target of p53, is an important negative regulator of h-eag1 through dual mechanisms by directly repressing h-eag1 at the post-transcriptional level and indirectly silencing h-eag1 at the transcriptional level via repressing E2F1. There is a strong inverse relationship between the expression levels of miR-34 and h-eag1 protein. H-eag1antisense antagonized the growth-stimulating effects and the upregulation of h-eag1 expression in SHSY5Y cells, induced by knockdown of miR-34, E2F1 overexpression, or inhibition of p53 activity. Therefore, p53 negatively regulates h-eag1 expression by a negative feed-forward mechanism through the p53-miR-34-E2F1 pathway. Inactivation of p53 activity, as is the case in many cancers, can thus cause oncogenic overexpression of h-eag1 by relieving the negative feed-forward regulation. These findings not only help us understand the molecular mechanisms for oncogenic overexpression of h-eag1 in tumorigenesis but also uncover the cell-cycle regulation through the p53-miR-34-E2F1-h-eag1 pathway. Moreover, these findings place h-eag1 in the p53-miR-34-E2F1-h-eag1 pathway with h-eag as a terminal effecter component and with miR-34 (and E2F1) as a linker between p53 and h-eag1. Our study therefore fills the gap between p53 pathway and its cellular function mediated by h-eag1.

J	Martel, P; Leo, D; Fulton, S; Berard, M; Trudeau, LE				Martel, Philippe; Leo, Damiana; Fulton, Stephanie; Berard, Maxime; Trudeau, Louis-Eric			Role of Kv1 Potassium Channels in Regulating Dopamine Release and Presynaptic D2 Receptor Function	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GLUTAMATE-DEPENDENT INHIBITION; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA NEURONS; GATED K+ CHANNELS; IN-VIVO; MEDIATED INHIBITION; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; NERVE-TERMINALS; DEFICIENT MICE; ION CHANNELS; RAT STRIATUM	Dopamine (DA) release in the CNS is critical for motor control and motivated behaviors. Dysfunction of its regulation is thought to be implicated in drug abuse and in diseases such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's. Although various potassium channels located in the somatodendritic compartment of DA neurons such as G-protein-gated inward rectifying potassium channels (GIRK) have been shown to regulate cell firing and DA release, little is presently known about the role of potassium channels localized in the axon terminals of these neurons. Here we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to study electrically-evoked DA release in rat dorsal striatal brain slices. We find that although G-protein-gated inward rectifying (GIRK) and ATP-gated (K(ATP)) potassium channels play only a minor role, voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv1 family play a major role in regulating DA release. The use of Kv subtype-selective blockers confirmed a role for Kv1.2, 1.3 and 1.6, but not Kv1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 4.2. Interestingly, Kv1 blockers also reduced the ability of quinpirole, a D2 receptor agonist, to inhibit evoked DA overflow, thus suggesting that Kv1 channels also regulate presynaptic D2 receptor function. Our work identifies Kv1 potassium channels as key regulators of DA release in the striatum.

The labeling of living cells in these structures is key for the understanding of brain development and function, yet the generation of stable lines expressing reporter genes in specific spatio-temporal patterns remains a limiting step. In this study we present a fast and reliable pipeline to efficiently generate a set of stable lines expressing a reporter gene in multiple neuronal structures in the developing nervous system in medaka. The pipeline combines both the accurate computational genome-wide prediction of neuronal specific cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and a newly developed experimental setup to rapidly obtain transgenic lines in a cost-effective and highly reproducible manner. 95% of the CRMs tested in our experimental setup show enhancer activity in various and numerous neuronal structures belonging to all major brain subdivisions. This pipeline represents a significant step towards the dissection of embryonic neuronal development in vertebrates.

Early diagnosis of peripheral nervous system involvement in Fabry disease and treatment of neuropathic pain: the report of an expert panel	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Diagnosis; Fabry Disease; Neuropathy; Pain; Treatment	ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SMALL-FIBER NEUROPATHY; ROCHESTER DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL; AGALSIDASE-BETA THERAPY; OUTCOME SURVEY; PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT; CLINICAL-MANIFESTATIONS; ALPHA-GALACTOSIDASE	Background: Fabry disease is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by progressive lysosomal accumulation of lipids in a variety of cell types, including neural cells. Small, unmyelinated nerve fibers are particularly affected and small fiber peripheral neuropathy often clinically manifests at young age. Peripheral pain can be chronic and/or occur as provoked attacks of excruciating pain. Manifestations of dysfunction of small autonomic fibers may include, among others, impaired sweating, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and abnormal pain perception. Patients with Fabry disease often remain undiagnosed until severe complications involving the kidney, heart, peripheral nerves and/or brain have arisen. Methods: An international expert panel convened with the goal to provide guidance to clinicians who may encounter unrecognized patients with Fabry disease on how to diagnose these patients early using simple diagnostic tests. A further aim was to offer recommendations to control neuropathic pain. Results: We describe the neuropathy in Fabry disease, focusing on peripheral small fiber dysfunction - the hallmark of early neurologic involvement in this disorder. The clinical course of peripheral pain is summarized, and the importance of medical history-taking, including family history, is highlighted. A thorough physical examination (e. g., angiokeratoma, corneal opacities) and simple non-invasive sensory perception tests could provide clues to the diagnosis of Fabry disease. Reported early clinical benefits of enzyme replacement therapy include reduction of neuropathic pain, and adequate management of residual pain to a tolerable and functional level can substantially improve the quality of life for patients. Conclusions: Our recommendations can assist in diagnosing Fabry small fiber neuropathy early, and offer clinicians guidance in controlling peripheral pain. This is particularly important since management of pain in young patients with Fabry disease appears to be inadequate.

Tactile-Auditory Shape Learning Engages the Lateral Occipital Complex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SENSORY SUBSTITUTION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; CORTICAL REGIONS; AREAS; BLIND; REPRESENTATION; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; VISION	Shape is an object property that inherently exists in vision and touch, and is processed in part by the lateral occipital complex (LOC). Recent studies have shown that shape can be artificially coded by sound using sensory substitution algorithms and learned with behavioral training. This finding offers a unique opportunity to test intermodal generalizability of the LOC beyond the sensory modalities in which shape is naturally perceived. Therefore, we investigated the role of the LOC in processing of shape by examining neural activity associated with learning tactile-shape-coded auditory information. Nine blindfolded sighted people learned the tactile-auditory relationship between raised abstract shapes and their corresponding shape-coded sounds over 5 d of training. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects were scanned before and after training during a task in which they first listened to a shape-coded sound transformation, then touched an embossed shape, and responded whether or not the tactile stimulus matched the auditory stimulus in terms of shape. We found that behavioral scores improved after training and that the LOC was commonly activated during the auditory and tactile conditions both before and after training. However, no significant training-related change was observed in magnitude or size of LOC activity; rather, the auditory cortex and LOC showed strengthened functional connectivity after training. These findings suggest that the LOC is available to different sensory systems for shape processing and that auditory-tactile sensory substitution training leads to neural changes allowing more direct or efficient access to this site by the auditory system.

The formation of complex stereotypic connections between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and second-order neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) is believed to be important for accurate odorant information processing. In mice, ablation of OSNs that innervate the dorsal region of the OB leads to a loss of avoidance behavior in response to aversive and predator odorants (Kobayakawa et al., 2007). It remains to be determined whether the accurate formation of a glomerular map in this region of the OB is required for these innate responses. Here, we have generated mice that lack expression of the axon guidance receptor Robo-2 in OSNs and found that ablation of Robo-2 expression leads to mistargeting of subsets of OSN axons within the dorsal region of the OB. Furthermore, these mice show decreased avoidance behavior toward the predator odorant trimethyl-thiazoline. Our results indicate that the pattern of glomerular innervation in the OB is critical for innate behavioral responses in mice.	[Cho, Jin Hyung; Prince, Janet E.

Bistable Percepts in the Brain: fMRI Contrasts Monocular Pattern Rivalry and Binocular Rivalry	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; HUMAN OCCIPITAL CORTEX; AMBIGUOUS FIGURES; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; DEPTH; ATTENTION; MODEL; V1	The neural correlates of binocular rivalry have been actively debated in recent years, and are of considerable interest as they may shed light on mechanisms of conscious awareness. In a related phenomenon, monocular rivalry, a composite image is shown to both eyes. The subject experiences perceptual alternations in which the two stimulus components alternate in clarity or salience. The experience is similar to perceptual alternations in binocular rivalry, although the reduction in visibility of the suppressed component is greater for binocular rivalry, especially at higher stimulus contrasts. We used fMRI at 3T to image activity in visual cortex while subjects perceived either monocular or binocular rivalry, or a matched non-rivalrous control condition. The stimulus patterns were left/right oblique gratings with the luminance contrast set at 9%, 18% or 36%. Compared to a blank screen, both binocular and monocular rivalry showed a U-shaped function of activation as a function of stimulus contrast, i.e. higher activity for most areas at 9% and 36%. The sites of cortical activation for monocular rivalry included occipital pole (V1, V2, V3), ventral temporal, and superior parietal cortex. The additional areas for binocular rivalry included lateral occipital regions, as well as inferior parietal cortex close to the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). In particular, higher-tier areas MT+ and V3A were more active for binocular than monocular rivalry for all contrasts. In comparison, activation in V2 and V3 was reduced for binocular compared to monocular rivalry at the higher contrasts that evoked stronger binocular perceptual suppression, indicating that the effects of suppression are not limited to interocular suppression in V1.

Neural control of heart rate: The role of neuronal networking	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Neurocardiology; Sympathetic control; Neural networking; Heart rate oscillations; Mayer waves	WAVES; PRESSURE	Neural control of heart rate, particularly its sympathetic component, is generally thought to reside primarily in the central nervous system, though accumulating evidence suggests that intrathoracic extracardiac and intrinsic cardiac ganglia are also involved. We propose an integrated model in which the control of heart rate is achieved via three neuronal "levels" representing three control centers instead of the conventional one. Most importantly, in this model control is effected through networking between neuronal populations within and among these layers. The results obtained indicate that networking serves to process demands for systemic blood flow before transducing them to cardiac motor neurons. This provides the heart with a measure of protection against the possibility of "overdrive" implied by the currently held centrally driven system. The results also show that localized networking instabilities can lead to sporadic low frequency oscillations that have the characteristics of the well-known Mayer waves. The sporadic nature of Mayer waves has been unexplained so far and is of particular interest in clinical diagnosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

How the local cellular environment contributes to the initial sprouting of these branches in specific points of an axonal shaft remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: The principal mammillary tract (pm) is a landmark axonal bundle connecting ventral diencephalon to brainstem (through the mammillotegmental tract, mtg). Late in development, the axons of the principal mammillary tract sprout collateral branches at a very specific point forming a large bundle whose target is the thalamus. Inspection of this model showed a number of distinct, identified cell populations originated in the dorsal and the ventral diencephalon and migrating during development to arrange themselves into several discrete groups around the branching point. Further analysis of this system in several mouse lines carrying mutant alleles of genes expressed in defined subpopulations (including Pax6, Foxb1, Lrp6 and Gbx2) together with the use of an unambiguous genetic marker of mammillary axons revealed: 1) a specific group of Pax6-expressing cells in close apposition with the prospective branching point is indispensable to elicit axonal branching in this system; and 2) cooperation of transcription factors Foxb1 and Pax6 to differentially regulate navigation and fasciculation of distinct branches of the principal mammillary tract. Conclusions/Significance: Our results define for the first time a model system where interaction of the axonal shaft with a specific group of surrounding cells is essential to promote branching. Additionally, we provide insight on the cooperative transcriptional regulation necessary to promote and organize an intricate axonal tree.

We investigated the relationship between CC size and intelligence quotient (IQ) in the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development sample, a large cohort of healthy children and adolescents (aged six to 18, n = 198) recruited to be representative of the US population. CC midsagittal area was measured using an automated system that partitioned the CC into 25 subregions. IQ was measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). After correcting for total brain volume and age, a significant negative correlation was found between total CC midsagittal area and IQ (r=-0.147; p=0.040). Post hoc analyses revealed a significant negative correlation in children (age < 12) (r=-0.279; p=0.004) but not in adolescents (age >= 12) (r=-0.005; p=0.962). Partitioning the subjects by gender revealed a negative correlation in males (r=-0.231; p=0.034) but not in females (r=0.083; p=0.389). Results suggest that the association between CC and intelligence is mostly driven by male children. In children, a significant gender difference was observed for FSIQ and PIQ, and in males, a significant age-group difference was observed for FSIQ and PIQ. These findings suggest that the correlation between CC midsagittal area and IQ may be related to age and gender.

Ventromedial Frontal Lobe Damage Disrupts Value Maximization in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; REWARD VALUE; PREFERENCE JUDGMENTS; SUBJECTIVE VALUE; HUMAN BRAIN; CHOICE; REPRESENTATIONS; BEHAVIOR	Recent work in neuroeconomics has shown that regions in orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortex encode the subjective value of different options during choice. However, these electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies cannot demonstrate whether such signals are necessary for value-maximizing choices. Here we used a paradigm developed in experimental economics to empirically measure and quantify violations of utility theory in humans with damage to the ventromedial frontal lobe (VMF). We show that people with such damage are more likely to make choices that violate the generalized axiom of revealed preference, which is the one necessary and sufficient condition for choices to be consistent with value maximization. These results demonstrate that the VMF plays a critical role in value-maximizing choice.

Effective Treatment of Chronic Low Back Pain in Humans Reverses Abnormal Brain Anatomy and Function	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; GRAY-MATTER DECREASE; CORTICAL THICKNESS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; FIBROMYALGIA PATIENTS; PERSISTENT PAIN; MRI DATA	Chronic pain is associated with reduced brain gray matter and impaired cognitive ability. In this longitudinal study, we assessed whether neuroanatomical and functional abnormalities were reversible and dependent on treatment outcomes. We acquired MRI scans from chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients before (n = 18) and 6 months after (spine surgery or facet joint injections; n = 14) treatment. In addition, we scanned 16 healthy controls, 10 of which returned 6 months after the first visit. We performed cortical thickness analysis on structural MRI scans, and subjects performed a cognitive task during the functional MRI. We compared patients and controls, as well as patients before versus after treatment. After treatment, patients had increased cortical thickness in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was thinner before treatment compared with controls. Increased DLPFC thickness correlated with the reduction of both pain and physical disability. Additionally, increased thickness in primary motor cortex was associated specifically with reduced physical disability, and right anterior insula was associated specifically with reduced pain. Left DLPFC activity during an attention-demanding cognitive task was abnormal before treatment, but normalized following treatment. These data indicate that functional and structural brain abnormalities-specifically in the left DLPFC-are reversible, suggesting that treating chronic pain can restore normal brain function in humans.

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C promotes cell survival and tumor growth under conditions of metabolic stress	GENES & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						CPT1C; fatty acid homeostasis; metabolic stress; rapamycin resistance; xenograft tumors	BREAST-TUMORS; KINASE AMPK; MOUSE MODEL; CANCER; GENE; PHOSPHORYLATION; GLYCOLYSIS; CHECKPOINT; RECEPTOR; DISEASE	Tumor cells gain a survival/growth advantage by adapting their metabolism to respond to environmental stress, a process known as metabolic transformation. The best-known aspect of metabolic transformation is the Warburg effect, whereby cancer cells up-regulate glycolysis under aerobic conditions. However, other mechanisms mediating metabolic transformation remain undefined. Here we report that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C), a brain-specific metabolic enzyme, may participate in metabolic transformation. CPT1C expression correlates inversely with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation, contributes to rapamycin resistance in murine primary tumors, and is frequently up-regulated in human lung tumors. Tumor cells constitutively expressing CPT1C show increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation, ATP production, and resistance to glucose deprivation or hypoxia. Conversely, cancer cells lacking CPT1C produce less ATP and are more sensitive to metabolic stress. CPT1C depletion via siRNA suppresses xenograft tumor growth and metformin responsiveness in vivo. CPT1C can be induced by hypoxia or glucose deprivation and is regulated by AMPK alpha. Cpt1c-deficient murine embryonic stem (ES) cells show sensitivity to hypoxia and glucose deprivation and altered FA homeostasis. Our results indicate that cells can use a novel mechanism involving CPT1C and FA metabolism to protect against metabolic stress. CPT1C may thus be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of hypoxic tumors.

Defects in this maturation process can result in malpositioned ureters and hydronephrosis, a common cause of renal disease in children. Here, we report that insertion of the ND into the cloaca is an unrecognized but crucial step that is required for proper positioning of the ureter and that depends on Ret signaling. Analysis of Ret mutant mice at birth reveals hydronephrosis and defective ureter maturation, abnormalities that our results suggest are caused, at least in part, by delayed insertion of the ND. We find a similar set of malformations in mutants lacking either Gata3 or Raldh2. We show that these factors act in parallel to regulate ND insertion via Ret. Morphological analysis of ND extension in wild-type embryos reveals elaborate cellular protrusions at ND tips that are not detected in Ret, Gata3 or Raldh2 mutant embryos, suggesting that these protrusions may normally be important for fusion with the cloaca. Together, our studies reveal a novel Ret-dependent event, ND insertion, that, when abnormal, can cause obstruction and hydronephrosis at birth; whether ND defects underlie similar types of urinary tract abnormalities in humans is an interesting possibility.

Using the MS2-GFP system, which tethers fluorescent proteins to a specific mRNA, we followed the dynamics of single CUG-repeat transcripts and RNA aggregation in living cells. Single transcripts with 145 CUG repeats from the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene had reduced diffusion kinetics compared with transcripts containing only five CUG repeats. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments showed that CUG-repeat RNAs display a stochastic aggregation behaviour, because individual RNA foci formed at different rates and displayed different recoveries. Spontaneous clustering of CUG-repeat RNAs was also observed, confirming the stochastic aggregation revealed by FRAP. The splicing factor Mbnl1 colocalized with individual CUG-repeat transcripts and its aggregation with RNA foci displayed the same stochastic behaviour as CUG-repeat mRNAs. Moreover, depletion of Mbnl1 by RNAi resulted in decreased aggregation of CUG-repeat transcripts after FRAP, supporting a direct role for Mbnl1 in CUG-rich RNA foci formation. Our data reveal that nuclear CUG-repeat RNA aggregates are labile, constantly forming and disaggregating structures, and that the Mbnl1 splicing factor is directly involved in the aggregation process.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie decoding of stimulus orientation or the stimulated eye. These include: (I) aliasing of high spatial-frequency components, including the main frequency component of the columnar organization, (II) contributions from local irregularities in the columnar organization, (III) contributions from large-scale non-columnar organizations, (IV) functionally selective veins with biased draining regions, and (V) complex spatio-temporal filtering of neuronal activity by fMRI voxels. Here we sought to assess the plausibility of two of the suggested mechanisms: (I) aliasing and (II) local irregularities, using a naive model of BOLD as blurring and MRI voxel sampling. To this end, we formulated a mathematical model that encompasses both the processes of imaging ocular dominance (OD) columns and the subsequent linear classification analysis. Through numerical simulations of the model, we evaluated the distribution of functional differential contrasts that can be expected when considering the pattern of cortical columns, the hemodynamic point spread function, the voxel size, and the noise. We found that with data acquisition parameters used at 3 Tesla, sub-voxel supra-Nyquist frequencies, including frequencies near the main frequency of the OD organization (0.5 cycles per mm), cannot contribute to the differential contrast. The differential functional contrast of local origin is dominated by low-amplitude contributions from low frequencies, associated with irregularities of the cortical pattern. Realizations of the model with parameters that reflected best-case scenario and the reported BOLD point-spread at 3 Tesla (3.5 mm) predicted decoding performances lower than those that have been previously obtained at this magnetic field strength. We conclude that low frequency components that underlie local irregularities in the columnar organization are likely to play a role in decoding. We further expect that fMRI-based decoding relies, in part, on signal contributions from large-scale, non-columnar functional organizations, and from complex spatio-temporal filtering of neuronal activity by fMRI voxels, involving biased venous responses. Our model can potentially be used for evaluating and optimizing data-acquisition parameters for decoding information conveyed by cortical columns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Increased BBB breakdown and brain injury are associated with neuroinflammation and are thought to trigger mechanisms involving matrix metalloproteinase upregulation. Emerging evidence also indicates that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition limits BBB disruption, but the mechanisms linking metalloproteinase to COX remain unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway, a common pathway in both the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and COX-2 expression, and the inhibitory properties of several chemopreventive flavonoids. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells were treated with a combination of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a carcinogen documented to increase MMP-9 and COX-2 through NF-kappa B, and several naturally occurring flavonoids. Among the molecules tested, we found that fisetin, apigenin, and luteolin specifically and dose-dependently antagonized PMA-induced COX-2 and MMP-9 gene and protein expressions as assessed by qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and zymography respectively. We further demonstrate that flavonoids impact on I kappa K-mediated phosphorylation activity as demonstrated by the inhibition of PMA-induced I kappa B phosphorylation levels. Our results suggest that BBB disruption during neuroinflammation could be pharmacologically reduced by a specific class of flavonoids acting as NF-kappa B signal transduction inhibitors.

Kufs Disease, the Major Adult Form of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Caused by Mutations in CLN6	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							MEMBRANE-PROTEIN CLN6; INBREEDING COEFFICIENT; TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN; GENE; DEFICIENCY; THIOESTERASE-1; DEGRADATION; CHILDHOOD; JUVENILE; TOOL	The molecular basis of Kufs disease is unknown, whereas a series of genes accounting for most of the childhood-onset forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) have been identified. Diagnosis of Kufs disease is difficult because the characteristic lipopigment is largely confined to neurons and can require a brain biopsy or aufopsy for final diagnosis. We mapped four families with Kufs disease for whom there was good evidence of autosomal-recessive inheritance and found two peaks on chromosome 15. Three of the families were affected by Kufs type A disease and presented with progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and one was affected by type B (presenting with dementia and motor system dysfunction). Sequencing of a candidate gene in one peak shared by all four families identified no mutations, but sequencing of CLN6, found in the second peak and shared by only the three families affected by Kufs type A disease, revealed pathogenic mutations in all three families. We subsequently sequenced CLN6 in eight other families, three of which were affected by recessive Kufs type A disease. Mutations in both CLN6 alleles were found in the three type A cases and in one family affected by unclassified Kufs disease. Mutations in CLN6 are the major cause Of recessive Kufs type A disease. The phenotypic differences between variant late-infantile NCL, previously found to be caused by CLN6, and Kufs type A disease are striking; there is a much later age at onset and lack of visual involvement in the latter. Sequencing of CLN6 will provide a simple diagnostic strategy in this disorder, in which definitive identification usually requires invasive biopsy.

Following conditioning, the ability to induce direction selectivity in tectal neurons, as well as both retinotectal long-term potentiation and depression, thought to underlie this phenomenon, was strongly facilitated. This facilitation was blocked by knockdown of BDNF expression in tectal neurons. Animals that had been exposed to visual conditioning and subsequently received normal visual input for 7-11 hr exhibited higher spatial frequency thresholds of tectal cell responses to counterphasing gratings than non-conditioned control animals. An improvement in visual acuity was confirmed by enhanced sensitivity to counterphasing gratings in a behavioral test. These results indicate that brief sensory stimulation, by initiating nuclear transcription and de novo protein synthesis of BDNF, can facilitate the refinement of response properties in the developing visual system.

We tested this hypothesis by recording single-unit activity in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) while a monkey performed two delayed center-out reaching tasks. In the one-target task, a single target was presented and its border style indicated its reward value. The two-target task was the same except two targets were presented and the value of each was varied. During the delay period of the one-target task, directionally tuned PMd activity showed no modulation with value. In contrast, during the two-target task, the same neurons showed strong effects of the value associated with their preferred target, always in relation to the value of the other target. Furthermore, the competition between action choices was strongest when targets were furthest apart. This angular distance effect appeared in neural activity as soon as cells became tuned, while modulation by relative value appeared much later. All of these findings can be reproduced by a computational model which suggests that decisions between actions are made through a biased competition taking place within a sensorimotor map of potential actions.

The compensatory mechanisms involved in maintaining these functions in blind people using their remaining intact senses are poorly understood. We investigated the ability of congenitally blind participants to detect and avoid obstacles using the tongue display unit, a sensory substitution device that uses the tongue as a portal to the brain. We found that congenitally blind were better than sighted control participants in detecting and avoiding obstacles using the tongue display unit. Obstacles size and avoidance strategy had a significant effect on performance: large obstacles were better detected than small ones and step-around obstacles were better avoided than step-over ones. These data extend our earlier findings that when using a sensory substitution device, blind participants outperform sighted controls not only in a virtual navigation task but also during effective navigation within a human-sized obstacle course.

J	Walczak, JS; Cervero, F				Walczak, Jean-Sebastien; Cervero, Fernando			Local activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the urinary bladder reduces the inflammation-induced sensitization of bladder afferents	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article							GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE-INDUCED CYSTITIS; RAT BLADDER; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; CHRONIC MODEL; WIN 55,212-2; MOUSE; EXPRESSION; MICE; NEURONS	Background: Systemic administration of cannabinoid agonists is known to reduce pain induced by bladder inflammation and to modulate cystometric parameters in vivo. We have previously reported that intravesical administration of a cannabinoid agonist reduces the electrical activity of bladder afferents under normal conditions. However, the effects of local activation of bladder cannabinoid receptors on afferent activity during inflammation are unknown. This study was aimed to assess the effects of intravesical administration of a cannabinoid agonist on the discharges of afferent fibers in inflamed bladders ex vivo. We also characterized the expression of CB1 receptors in the bladder and their localization and co-expression with TRPV1, a marker of nociceptive afferents. Results: Compared to untreated animals, afferent fiber activity in inflamed bladders was increased for intravesical pressures between 10 and 40 mmHg. Local treatment with a non selective cannabinoid agonist (AZ12646915) significantly reduced the afferent activity at intravesical pressures above 20 mmHg. This effect was blocked by AM251 but not by AM630 (selective for CB1 and CB2 respectively). Finally, CB1 was co-expressed with TRPV1 in control and inflamed bladders. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that sensitization of bladder afferents induced by inflammation is partly suppressed by intravesical activation of cannabinoid receptors, an effect that appears to be mediated by CB1 receptors. Also, TRPV1 positive fibers were found to co-express CB1, supporting the hypothesis of a direct action of the cannabinoid agonist on nociceptive afferents. Taken together, these results indicate a peripheral modulation by the cannabinoid system of bladder hypersensitivity during inflammation.

However, little is known about the spinal neuronal networks responsible for oxytocin effects. The aim of this study was to localize and characterize spinal neurons expressing oxytocin receptors. We used an oxytocin receptor-reporter mouse in which the fluorescent protein Venus is expressed under the control of the oxytocin receptor gene promoter. At all segmental levels. Venus-expressing neurons were most numerous in the substantia gelatinosa, mingled with protein kinase C gamma interneurons in the innermost layer of the inner lamina II, which, in contrast to the outer two thirds of this layer, does not receive nociceptive input. Venus-expressing neurons were also observed in the intermediolateral and sacral parasympathetic nuclei, where they represented about 5% of presumed preganglionic neurons identified by choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity. Finally. Venus immunoreactivity was detected in lumbar and sacral dorsal gray commissures as well as in isolated neurons scattered in different regions of the dorsal horn. Altogether, our results establish the location of neurons putatively involved in oxytocin modulation of spinal functions, in particular of sexual functioning and nociception.

Community structure has also been revealed in human brain structural and functional networks in previous studies. However, communities overlap and share many edges and nodes. Uncovering the overlapping community structure of complex networks remains largely unknown in human brain networks. Here, using regional gray matter volume, we investigated the structural brain network among 90 brain regions (according to a predefined anatomical atlas) in 462 young, healthy individuals. Overlapped nodes between communities were defined by assuming that nodes (brain regions) can belong to more than one community. We demonstrated that 90 brain regions were organized into 5 overlapping communities associated with several well-known brain systems, such as the auditory/language, visuospatial, emotion, decision-making, social, control of action, memory/learning, and visual systems. The overlapped nodes were mostly involved in an inferior-posterior pattern and were primarily related to auditory and visual perception. The overlapped nodes were mainly attributed to brain regions with higher node degrees and nodal efficiency and played a pivotal role in the flow of informa- tion through the structural brain network. Our results revealed fuzzy boundaries between communities by identifying overlapped nodes and provided new insights into the understanding of the relationship between the structure and function of the human brain. This study provides the first report of the overlapping community structure of the structural network of the human brain.

It can have a neurotoxic or neuroprotective effect. Here, we have studied the expression of IL-1 beta in vivo and the effect of the IL-1 receptor antagonist on choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and retinal degeneration (RD). IL-1 beta expression significantly increased after laser injury (real time PCR) in C57BL/6 mice, in the C57BL/6 Cx3cr1(-/-) model of age-related macular degeneration (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay), and in albino Wistar rats and albino BALB Cx3cr1(+/+) and Cx3cr1(-/-) mice (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay) after light injury. IL-1 beta was localized to Ly6G-positive, Iba1-negative infiltrating neutrophils in laser-induced CNV as determined by IHC. IL-1 receptor antagonist treatment significantly inhibited CNV but did not affect Iba1-positive macrophage recruitment to the injury site. IL-1 beta significantly increased endothelial cell outgrowth in aortic ring assay independently of vascular endothelial growth factor, suggesting a direct effect of IL-1 beta on choroidal endothelial cell proliferation. Inhibition of IL-1 beta in light- and laser-induced RD models did not alter photoreceptor degeneration in Wistar rats, C57BL/6 mice, or RD-prone Cx3cr1(-/-) mice. Our results suggest that IL-1 beta inhibition might represent a valuable and safe alternative to Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor in the control of CNV in the context of concomitant photoreceptor degeneration as observed in age-related macular degeneration.

J	Feldman, AG				Feldman, Anatol G.			Space and time in the context of equilibrium-point theory	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Review							THRESHOLD POSITION CONTROL; MOTOR CONTROL; STRETCH REFLEX; ARM MOVEMENTS; REACHING MOVEMENTS; DECEREBRATE CAT; LAMBDA-MODEL; HYPOTHESIS; MUSCLES; COORDINATION	Advances to the equilibrium-point (EP) theory and solutions to several classical problems of action and perception are suggested and discussed. Among them are (1) the posture-movement problem of how movements away from a stable posture can be made without evoking resistance of posture-stabilizing mechanisms resulting from intrinsic muscle and reflex properties; (2) the problem of kinesthesia or why our sense of limb position is fairly accurate despite ambiguous positional information delivered by proprioceptive and cutaneous signals; (3) the redundancy problems in the control of multiple muscles and degrees of freedom. Central to the EP hypothesis is the notion that there are specific neural structures that represent spatial frames of reference (FRs) selected by the brain in a task-specific way from a set of available FRs. The brain is also able to translate or/and rotate the selected FRs bymodifying their major attributes-the origin, metrics, and orientation-and thus substantially influence, in a feed-forward manner, action and perception. The brain does not directly solve redundancy problems: it only limits the amount of redundancy by predetermining where, in spatial coordinates, a task-specific action should emerge and allows all motor elements, including the environment, to interact to deliver a unique action, thus solving the redundancy problem (natural selection of action). The EP theory predicts the existence of specific neurons associated with the control of different attributes of FRs and explains the role of mirror neurons in the inferior frontal gyrus and place cells in the hippocampus.

Olfaction and Color Vision Identify Impending Neurodegeneration in Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							IDIOPATHIC PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; REM-SLEEP; DIAGNOSTIC-PROCEDURES; LEWY BODY; DYSFUNCTION; DEMENTIA; ATONIA; MARKER; SMELL	Objective: For development of neuroprotective therapy, neurodegenerative disease must be identified as early as possible. However, current means of identifying "preclinical" neurodegeneration are limited. Patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are at >50% risk of synuclein-mediated neurodegenerative disease-this provides a unique opportunity to directly observe preclinical synucleinopathy and to test potential markers of preclinical disease. Methods: Patients with RBD without neurodegenerative disease were enrolled in a prospective cohort starting in 2004. Olfaction and color vision were tested at baseline, then annually for 5 years. Test results were compared between patients who developed neurodegenerative disease and those who remained disease-free. Results: Out of 64 patients, 62 (97%) participated in annual follow-up. During follow-up, 21 developed disease, and 41 remained disease-free. Out of 21, 16 developed a combination of parkinsonism and dementia, 4 developed isolated parkinsonism (all with tremor), and 1 developed isolated dementia. Compared to those remaining disease-free, patients destined to develop disease had worse baseline olfaction (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT] = 58.3 +/- 27.0% age/sex-adjusted normal vs 80.2 +/- 26.3%; p = 0.003) and color vision (Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue color test [FM-100] errors 153.0 +/- 82.2% normal vs 120.2 +/- 26.5%; p = 0.022). Kaplan-Meier 5-year-disease-free survival in those with normal olfaction was 86.0%, vs 35.4% with impaired olfaction (p = 0.029). Disease-free survival with normal color vision was 70.3%, vs 26.0% with impaired vision (p = 0.009). Both olfaction and color vision were reduced as much as 5 years before disease diagnosis, with only slight decline in preclinical stages. Interpretation: Olfaction and color vision identify early-stage synuclein-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, abnormalities are measurable at least 5 years before disease onset, and progress slowly in the preclinical stages.

Development of a compliant and cytocompatible micro-fibrous polyethylene terephthalate vascular scaffold	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS			English	Article						nonwoven PET scaffolds; melt-blowing; vascular cells; compliance; shear stress	ENDOTHELIAL-CELL GROWTH; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; SHEAR-STRESS; IN-VITRO; BYPASS GRAFTS; BLOOD-VESSEL; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ASTROGLIAL CELLS; ELASTIC FIBERS; ARTERIES	Bioengineering approaches have been intensively applied to create small diameter vascular grafts using artificial materials. However, a fully successful, high performing and anti-thrombogenic structure has not been achieved yet. In this study, we have designed and fabricated a novel non-woven fibrous vascular graft with biomechanical properties closely resembling those of native vessels. Vascular cell growth, preservation of cell phenotype, retention of vasoactive properties, as well as the effect of gelatin coating on the cellular interaction with the scaffolds under static and shear stress conditions were investigated. The non-woven fibrous scaffolds were made from melt blown polyethylene terephthalate fiber webs stacked by means of a consolidation technique. The scaffold variables were fiber diameter distribution and the number of consolidated web stacks. SEM analysis confirmed various fiber diameter and pore size ranges corresponding to the different conditions. The scaffolds showed burst pressure values of similar to 1500 mmHg and compliance (8.4 +/- 1.0 x 10(-2)% mmHg(-1)) very similar to those of native arteries (similar to 8 x 10(-2)% mmHg(-1)). The structure with the smallest fiber diameter range (1-5 mu m) and pore size range (1-20 mu m) was the most suitable for the growth of human brain endothelial cells and aortic smooth muscle cells. The cells maintained their specific cell phenotype, expressed collagen and elastin and produced cAMP in response to a-calcitonin gene-related peptide. However, under shear stress conditions (0.9 dyne cm(-2)), only 30% of the cells were retained in both uncoated and gelatin-coated scaffolds indicating the need for improving the cell retention capacity of these structures, which is our future research direction. This study indicates that the biomechanical and biocompatible properties of this novel vascular scaffold are promising for the development of a vascular graft with similar characteristics to those of native vessels.

The existing CBM methods for wind power generation systems deal with wind turbine components separately, that is, maintenance decisions are made on individual components, rather than the whole system. However, a wind farm generally consists of multiple wind turbines, and each wind turbine has multiple components including main bearing, gearbox, generator, etc. There are economic dependencies among wind turbines and their components. That is, once a maintenance team is sent to the wind farm, it may be more economical to take the opportunity to maintain multiple turbines, and when a turbine is stopped for maintenance, it may be more cost-effective to simultaneously replace multiple components which show relatively high risks. In this paper, we develop an optimal CBM solution to the above-mentioned issues. The proposed maintenance policy is defined by two failure probability threshold values at the wind turbine level. Based on the condition monitoring and prognostics information, the failure probability values at the component and the turbine levels can be calculated, and the optimal CBM decisions can be made accordingly. A simulation method is developed to evaluate the cost of the CBM policy. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed CBM approach. A comparative study based on commonly used constant-interval maintenance policy demonstrates the advantage of the proposed CBM approach in reducing the maintenance cost. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

New and Emerging Drugs and Device Therapies for Chronic Heart Failure in Patients With Systolic Ventricular Dysfunction	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Review							ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; BLOOD-PRESSURE; BETA-BLOCKER; MORTALITY; SURVIVAL; OUTCOMES; MORBIDITY; SPIRONOLACTONE	Chronic heart failure remains a common end product of cardiovascular diseases and, despite significant advances in therapy, continues to be accompanied by significant morbidity and mortality. Attenuation of neurohumoral overactivation with blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and beta-blockers has improved outcome and helped reverse or halt disease progression in many patients; however, despite this, morbidity and mortality have remained elevated, and only marginal advances have occurred over the last few years. How best to combine these various agents continue to be tested but, apart from the addition of aldosterone receptor blockers and reduction of heart rate with ivabradine, advances have been few. Implantable defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization devices have proved to be very beneficial, and the limits of their use are presently still being tested. How best to handle atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure remains unanswered, but for now, rate control appears to be appropriate in many patients. Surgical ventricular restoration of the left ventricle has not proved to generally be useful, and although the role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is well established in some patients, its use in others is being reevaluated. The use of bio-markers in patients with heart failure has stimulated great interest; however, much work remains before its full potential can be realized.

Objectives: We aimed to describe the changes in diagnostic testing for dystrophinopathy and to determine the frequency of dystrophin mutations from 2000 to 2009. Methods: De-identified data containing the clinical phenotypes, diagnostic methods, and mutational reports from dystrophinopathy patients followed by CPNG centres from January 2000 to December 2009 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: 773 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of clystrophinopathy based on genetic testing (97%), muscle biopsy (2%), or family history (1%). 573 (74%) had complete deletion/duplication analysis of all 79 exons or whole gene sequencing, resulting in 366 (64%) deletions, 64 (11%) duplications, and 143 (25%) point mutations. The percentage of patients who were diagnosed using currently accepted genetic testing methods varied across Canada, with a mean of 63% (SD 23). 246 (43%) mutations involved exons 45 to 53. The top ten deletions (n=147, 26%) were exons 45-47, 45-48, 45, 45-50, 45-55, 51, 45-49, 45-52, 49-50, and 46-47. 169 (29%) mutations involved exons 2 to 20. The most common duplications (n=29, 5.1%) were exons 2, 2-7, 2-17, 3-7, 8-11, 10, 10-11, and 12. Conclusion: This is the most comprehensive report of dystrophin mutations in Canada. Consensus guidelines regarding the diagnostic approach to dystrophinopathy will hopefully reduce the geographical variation in mutation detection rates in the coming decade.

J	Khatamian, YB; Fahoum, F; Gotman, J				Khatamian, Yasha Borna; Fahoum, Firas; Gotman, Jean			Limits of 2D-TCA in detecting BOLD responses to epileptic activity	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Functional MRI; Cluster analysis; EEG-fMRI; Epilepsy; Brain mapping	TEMPORAL CLUSTERING ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EEG; FMRI; DISCHARGES; BRAIN; 2DTCA	Two-dimensional temporal clustering analysis (2D-TCA) is a relatively new functional MRI (fMRI) based technique that breaks blood oxygen level dependent activity into separate components based on timing and has shown potential for localizing epileptic activity independently of electroencephalography (EEG). 2D-TCA has only been applied to detect epileptic activity in a few studies and its limits in detecting activity of various forms (i.e. activation size, amplitude, and frequency) have not been investigated. This study evaluated 2D-TCA's ability to detect various forms of both simulated epileptic activity and EEG-fMRI activity detected in patients. When applied to simulated data, 20-TCA consistently detected activity in 6 min runs containing 5 spikes/run, 10 spikes/run, and one 5s long event with hemodynamic response function amplitudes of at least 1.5%, 1.25%, and 1% above baseline respectively. When applied to patient data, while detection of interictal spikes was inconsistent, 2D-TCA consistently produced results similar to those obtained by EEG-fMRI when at least 2 prolonged interictal events (a few seconds each) occurred during the run. However, even for such cases it was determined that 2D-TCA can only be used to validate localization by other means or to create hypotheses as to where activity may occur, as it also detects changes not caused by epileptic activity.

Using a standard change-detection task, fMRI studies have shown that maintenance of bilaterally encoded objects elicited bilateral increases of hemodynamic activation in the intra-parietal and intra-occipital sulci (IPS-IOS) proportional to the number of objects retained in visual short-term memory. We used a spatially cued variant of the change-detection task to record hemodynamic responses to unilaterally encoded objects using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Electrophysiological studies that employed this task have shown that maintenance of unilaterally encoded objects elicited posterior unilateral (contralateral) increase in event-related negativity proportional to the number of objects retained in visual short-term memory. We therefore examined whether contralateral increases in oxy-hemoglobin concentration correlated with the number of retained objects. Contrary to the idea that bilateral increases in BOLD responses and unilateral increases in event-related negativity may be different reflections of the same underlying neural/functional processing, memory-related increases in oxy-hemoglobin concentration were found bilaterally even when objects had to be encoded unilaterally. The present findings suggest that EEG and fMRI/fNIRS techniques reveal distinct neural signatures of the mechanisms supporting visual short-term memory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Identification of a non-linear F/A-18 model by the use of fuzzy logic and neural network methods	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART G-JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						fuzzy logic; neural network; model identification; flight tests		The aim of this article is to determine the mathematical model between control deflections and structural deflections in an F/A-18 modified aircraft in the active aeroelastic wing programme. One future application would be the design of a flutter suppression model based on flight flutter tests. Five excited sources were provided by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center from flight flutter tests. These excitations, given by aircraft control surfaces, are: differential and collective ailerons, collective and differential stabilizers, and rudders. The neural network and fuzzy logic algorithms were chosen in order to identify the multi-input multi-output system for the F/A-18 aircraft. One main contribution of this article is the mapping of fuzzy logic algorithm results into neural network data. Then, these methods were applied for the F/A-18 model identification and validation for sixteen flight conditions expressed in terms of Mach numbers variations between 0.85 and 1.30 and altitudes varying between 5000 and 25 000 ft. Accurate results were obtained, expressed in terms of fit coefficients between estimated and measured signals greater than 99 per cent, which allows one to conclude that these new methodologies are very efficient for an aircraft identification and validation.

New helicopter model identification method based on flight test data	AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION	A helicopter model has been identified and validated for flight conditions defined by altitudes, speeds, loadings and centre of gravity positions. To identify the helicopter models, 2-3-1-1 multistep control inputs were performed by the pilot to excite all helicopter modes. Then, each estimated signal has to remain in tolerance margins defined by the Federal Aviation Administration. Three methods were used to observe the system outputs from its states: a fuzzy logic method, a linear method optimised with a neural network algorithm and a classical method. Because of random effects when gathering data, classical method did not give good enough results. The fuzzy logic method was not robust enough so that output plots showed peaks that could be felt by the pilot. Then, because the model could be implemented in a simulator for the pilot training, the pilot feedback is very useful in order to compare the reality with the results of the mathematical model. When the outputs are obtained from the measured state variables, the linear method gave the best results.	[Mota, S. De Jesus; Botez, R.

We present criteria for all-cause dementia and for AD dementia. We retained the general framework of probable AD dementia from the 1984 criteria. On the basis of the past 27 years of experience, we made several changes in the clinical criteria for the diagnosis. We also retained the term possible AD dementia, but redefined it in a manner more focused than before. Biomarker evidence was also integrated into the diagnostic formulations for probable and possible AD dementia for use in research settings. The core clinical criteria for AD dementia will continue to be the cornerstone of the diagnosis in clinical practice, but biomarker evidence is expected to enhance the pathophysiological specificity of the diagnosis of AD dementia. Much work lies ahead for validating the biomarker diagnosis of AD dementia. (C) 2011 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.

Assessing Prognosis from Nonrandomized Studies: An Example from Brain Arteriovenous Malformations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							MODEL; DATABASES; TRIALS	Two recent publications from Helsinki and Toronto that investigated the natural history of brain AVMs are the background topic for reviewing some principles and pitfalls of prognostic studies. Multivariable prognostic research involves 3 steps: developing the prognostic model, validating its performance in other individuals, and assessing its clinical impact on patients' outcomes. Unfortunately, the predictive ability of the model can be poor when it is applied to a new population, and clinical impact studies are rarely performed. Models that have not been validated should not be used to inform clinical decisions. Unfortunately, for rare outcomes in rare diseases, clinical data are limited. Although the 2 studies on brain AVMs may represent the best data currently available, they still included few patients with events and there are several methodologic concerns undermining the reliability of results. The estimates of risk of rupture per year are uncertain. Multiplying those uncertain numbers by the life expectancy of individuals can inflate error beyond control. Hence relying on these estimates to make clinical decisions may be dangerous.

Gene expression profiling of human angiotropic primary melanoma: Selection of 15 differentially expressed genes potentially involved in extravascular migratory metastasis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						Melanoma; Angiotropism; Extravascular migratory metastasis (EVMM); Gene expression; Neural crest migration	PRIMARY CUTANEOUS MELANOMA; CHORIOALLANTOIC MEMBRANE; CELLS; TRANSIT; CANCER; MODEL; AHNAK	Background and aim: Angiotropism and extravascular migratory metastasis (EVMM) are an important alternative means of melanoma spread. In EVMM, melanoma cells migrate along the external surfaces of vascular channels to distant sites and demonstrate microscopic angiotropism, i.e. melanoma cells arrayed along the external surfaces of vascular endothelium. Pertinent to EVMM are the origin of melanocytes from the neural crest (NC) and strong analogies of EVMM with NC cell migration. Our aim is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying angiotropism and EVMM. Methods: Frozen primary melanomas, previously utilised for gene expression profiling, were analysed for angiotropism as a differential marker. From the results of this new microarray analysis, we sought to identify genes which were directly relevant to the basic mechanisms underlying EVMM. Results: Among 66 melanomas from patients who developed metastases or remained disease-free at 4 years of follow-up, 26 melanomas were angiotropic while 35 were not, and five were equivocal. The new microarray analysis identified 128 genes differentially expressed in angiotropic versus non-angiotropic melanomas. Among these 128 genes, 15 genes were potentially directly involved in EVMM, based their respective expressions in the NC (seven genes), in other malignant tumours of NC origin (three genes), in cell motility and/or migration (four genes) and in neurotropism (one gene). Conclusion: The detection of these 15 genes provides additional support for the importance of angiotropism and the mechanism of EVMM in melanoma. Ongoing studies on this new profile of 15 genes may potentially identify new targets for controlling melanoma metastasis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective: To assess whether these concussion-related alterations of motor system function are still evident in collegiate football players who sustained concussions but returned to competition more than 9 months before testing. Design: Case-control study. Setting: University laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A group of 21 active, university-level football players who had experienced concussions was compared with 15 university football players who had not sustained concussions. Intervention(s): A force platform was used to assess center-of-pressure (COP) displacement and COP oscillation regularity (approximate entropy) as measures of postural stability in the upright position. A rapid alternating-movement task was also used to assess motor execution speed. Transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex was used to measure long-interval intracortical inhibition and the cortical silent period, presumably reflecting gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype B receptor mediated intracortical inhibition. Main Outcome Measure(S): COP displacement and oscillation regularity, motor execution speed, long-interval intracortical inhibition, cortical silent period. Results: Relative to controls, previously concussed athletes showed persistently lower COP oscillation randomness, normal performance on a rapid alternating-movement task, and more M1 intracortical inhibition that was related to the number of previous concussions. Conclusions: Sport concussions were associated with pervasive changes in postural control and more M1 intracortical inhibition, providing neurophysiologic and behavioral evidence of lasting, subclinical changes in motor system integrity in concussed athletes.

Therefore, there is an ongoing effort to develop influenza vaccines that also elicit strong and sustained cytotoxic responses against highly conserved determinants such as the matrix (M1) protein and nucleoprotein (NP). However, their antigenic presentation properties in humans are less defined. Accordingly, we analysed MHC class I and class II presentation of endogenously processed M1 and NP in human antigen presenting cells and observed expansion of both CD8(+)- and CD4(+)-specific effector T lymphocytes secreting gamma interferon and tumour necrosis factor. Further enhancement of basal MHC-II antigenic presentation did not improve CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-cell quality based on cytokine production upon challenge, suggesting that endogenous M1 and NP MHC-II presentation is sufficient. These new insights about T-lymphocyte expansion following endogenous M1 and NP MHC-I and -II presentation will be important to design complementary heterosubtypic vaccination strategies.

Here, we determined the high-resolution NMR structure of a stem-loop VI fragment containing the A730 internal loop, which forms part of the active site. In the presence of magnesium ions, the A730 loop adopts a structure that is consistent with existing biochemical data and most likely reflects its conformation in the VS ribozyme prior to docking with the cleavage site internal loop. Interestingly, the A730 loop adopts an S-turn motif that is also present in loop B within the hairpin ribozyme active site. The S-turn appears necessary to expose the Watson-Crick edge of a catalytically important residue (A756) so that it can fulfill its role in catalysis. The A730 loop and the cleavage site loop of the VS ribozyme display structural similarities to internal loops found in the active site of the hairpin ribozyme. These similarities provided a rationale to build a model of the VS ribozyme active site based on the crystal structure of the hairpin ribozyme.

Atomic-resolution characterization of the mechanisms responsible for the aggregation process and the resulting structures is thus a necessary step to improve our understanding of the determinants of these pathologies. To address this issue, we combine the accelerated sampling properties of replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations based on the OPEP coarse-grained potential with the atomic resolution description of interactions provided by all-atom MD simulations, and investigate the oligomerization process of the GNNQQNY for three system sizes: 3-mers, 12-mers and 20-mers. Results for our integrated simulations show a rich variety of structural arrangements for aggregates of all sizes. Elongated fibril-like structures can form transiently in the 20-mer case, but they are not stable and easily interconvert in more globular and disordered forms. Our extensive characterization of the intermediate structures and their physicochemical determinants points to a high degree of polymorphism for the GNNQQNY sequence that can be reflected at the macroscopic scale. Detailed mechanisms and structures that underlie amyloid aggregation are also provided.

We proposed that the ventral striatum underlies general learning of stimulus associations, whereas the dorsal striatum promotes integration of various influences on selecting. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine depletion is substantially less notable in the ventral relative to the dorsal striatum, and therefore greater improvements are expected for dorsal striatum-mediated functions with dopamine replacement. Using a simple selection task, we found that dopamine replacement impaired encoding and facilitation of consistent stimulus-stimulus relations across trials. This finding was in line with our contention that ventral striatum mediates learning stimulus associations, even when explicit feedback or reward is not provided. In contrast, dopamine replacement enhanced interference related to assimilating conflicting influences on selection across trials, consistent with our hypothesis that the dorsal striatum supports deciding in ambiguous contexts. We further confirmed these separable roles for the ventral and dorsal striatum in our selection task with healthy young volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In summary, we present a within-subject, double dissociation of the effects of dopamine replacement in patients with Parkinson's disease for ventral striatum-mediated facilitation and dorsal striatum-mediated interference, confirmed in a separate functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Defining the distinct functions of the ventral and dorsal striatum will have direct clinical implications. Titration of therapy in Parkinson's disease is generally geared towards optimizing dorsal striatum-mediated motor symptoms, possibly at the expense of ventral striatum operations, a consequence that is only beginning to be recognized. Enhanced awareness of these different processes will translate into medication strategies that take into account those symptoms that dopamine replacement might hinder, as well as improve. Here, we show impairments in learning new stimulus associations compared with improvements in integrating varied influences related to selection. Ultimately, this knowledge will lead clinicians to survey a broader range of symptoms in determining optimal therapy based on individual patient priorities.

Prognostic factors and development of a scoring system for outcome of neonatal seizures in term infants	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Newborn; Convulsions; Outcomes	QUALITY-STANDARDS-SUBCOMMITTEE; CHILD-NEUROLOGY-SOCIETY; ACADEMY-OF-NEUROLOGY; CEREBRAL-PALSY; PRACTICE-COMMITTEE; PRACTICE PARAMETER; NEWBORN-INFANTS; BRAIN-INJURY; ENCEPHALOPATHY; POPULATION	Objective: To identify independent prognostic indicators and design a predictive scoring system for neurodevelopmental outcome for term infants who experienced clinical neonatal seizures. Study Design: Retrospective analysis of 120 term infants who experienced clinical neonatal seizures between July 1991 and June 2007 in a single academic pediatric neurology practice. Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the independent prognostic indicators of an adverse outcome, which was defined as death, cerebral palsy, global developmental delay, and/or epilepsy. These indicators were then used to develop a scoring system. Results: A total of 53 infants had a normal outcome, 56 survived with one or more neurodevelopmental impairments (31 had cerebral palsy, 41 had global developmental delay, and 29 had epilepsy), and 11 died. Eleven variables were associated with adverse outcome on univariate analysis, but only method of delivery, time of seizure onset, seizure type, EEG background findings, and etiology were independent predictors on logistic regression analysis. A five-point scoring system was devised using these independent predictors with a sensitivity of 81.1% and a specificity of 84.0%. Conclusions: In term infants, delivery via cesarean section, experiencing a seizure during the first 24 h of life, presenting with a seizure other than focal clonic, showing a moderately or severely abnormal EEG background, and having certain specific etiologies were the apparent major determinants for an adverse outcome.

Postural adjustments for online corrections of arm movements in standing humans. J Neurophysiol 105: 2375-2388, 2011. First published February 23, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00944.2010.-The aim of this study was to investigate how humans correct ongoing arm movements while standing. Specifically, we sought to understand whether the postural adjustments in the legs required for online corrections of arm movements are predictive or rely on feedback from the moving limb. To answer this question we measured online corrections in arm and leg muscles during pointing movements while standing. Nine healthy right-handed subjects reached with their dominant arm to a visual target in front of them and aligned with their midline. In some trials, the position of the target would switch from the central target to one of the other targets located 15, 30, or 45 to the right of the central (midline) target. For each target correction, we measured the time at which arm kinematics, ground reaction forces, and arm and leg muscle electromyogram significantly changed in response to the target displacement. Results show that postural adjustments in the left leg preceded kinematic corrections in the limb. The corrective postural muscle activity in the left leg consistently preceded the corrective reaching muscle activity in the right arm. Our results demonstrate that corrections of arm movements in response to target displacement during stance are preceded by postural adjustments in the leg contralateral to the direction of target shift. Furthermore, postural adjustments preceded both the hand trajectory correction and the arm-muscle activity responsible for it, which suggests that the central nervous system does not depend on feedback from the moving arm to modify body posture during voluntary movement. Instead, postural adjustments lead the online correction in the arm the same way they lead the initiation of voluntary arm movements. This suggests that forward models for voluntary movements executed during stance incorporate commands for posture that are produced on the basis of the required task demands.

Contribution of cells in the posterior parietal cortex to the planning of visually guided locomotion in the cat: effects of temporary visual interruption. J Neurophysiol 105: 2457-2470, 2011. First published March 16, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00992.2010.-In the present study, we determined whether cells in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) may contribute to the planning of voluntary gait modifications in the absence of visual input. In two cats we recorded the responses of 41 neurons in layer V of the PPC that discharged in advance of the gait modification to a 900-ms interruption of visual information (visual occlusion). The cats continued to walk without interruption during the occlusion, which produced only minimal changes in step cycle duration and paw placement. Visual occlusion applied during the period of cell discharge was without significant effect on discharge frequency in 57% of cells. In the other cells, the visual occlusion produced either significant decreases (18%) or increases (21%) of discharge activity (in 1 cell there was both an increase and a decrease). The mean latency of the changes was 356 ms for decreases and 252 ms for increases. In most neurons, discharge frequency, when modified, returned to the same levels as during unoccluded locomotion when vision was restored. In some cells, there were significant changes in discharge activity after the restoration of vision; these were associated with corrections of gait. These results suggest that the PPC is more involved in the visuomotor transformations necessary to plan gait modifications than in continual sensory processing of visual information. We further propose that cells in the PPC contribute both to the planning of gait modifications on the basis of only intermittent visual sampling and to visually guided online corrections of gait.

MRI Correlates of Cognitive Impairment in Childhood-Onset Multiple Sclerosis	NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						MRI; multiple sclerosis; pediatric onset; neuropsychological assessment	CLINICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROMES; PERFORMANCE-TEST PERFORMANCE; BRAIN ATROPHY; LESION LOAD; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; CHILDREN; DYSFUNCTION; ROBUST; REGISTRATION; ACCURATE	Brain MRI measures were correlated with neuropsychological function in 35 pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 33 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Method: Mean age of MS patients was 16.3 +/- 2.3 years with average disease duration of 4.3 +/- 3.1 years. Cortical gray matter, thalamic, and global brain volumes were calculated for all participants using a scaling factor computed using normalization of atrophy method to normalize total and regional brain volumes for head size. T1- and T2-weighted lesion volumes were calculated for MS patients. Results: Cognitive impairment (CI) was identified in 29% of the MS cohort. Cognitive deficits predominantly involved attention and processing speed, expressive language, and visuomotor integration. Relative to controls, the MS group showed significantly lower thalamic volume (p < .001). total brain volume (p < .008), and gray matter volume (p < .015). Corpus callosum area and thalamic volume differentiated patients identified as having CI from those without CI (p < .05). Regression models controlling for disease duration and age indicated that thalamic volume accounted for significant incremental variance in predicting global IQ, processing speed, and expressive vocabulary (Delta R2 ranging from .43 to .60) and was the most robust MRI predictor of cognition relative to other MRI metrics. Conclusions: The robust association between cognitive function and reduced size of thalamus and global brain volume in pediatric-onset MS patients implicate neurodegenerative processes early in the disease course, and suggest that plasticity of an immature central nervous system is not sufficient to protect patients from the deleterious consequences of MS on cognitive neural networks.

Resequencing of 29 Candidate Genes in Patients With Familial and Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HEAVY NEUROFILAMENT SUBUNIT; MUTATIONS; MODEL	Objective: To identify novel disease-causing genes for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Design, Setting, and Patients: We carried out a systematic mutation screening of the entire coding regions of 29 candidate genes encoding critically important proteins for proper differentiation and development of corticospinal motor neurons in 190 patients with familial and sporadic ALS. Main Outcome Measures: We focused our analysis on coding variants and evaluated the distribution of nonsynonymous and synonymous variants in our cohort of patients with ALS. Results: We identified 40 novel nonsynonymous variants and showed a significant excess of unique nonsynonymous variants in our cohort of patients with ALS, which suggests the presence of ALS-predisposing mutations. Conclusions: Using a multifaceted approach based on the functional prediction of missense variants, the conservation of the altered amino acid, and the cosegregation of the variants identified in familial cases, we identified several promising novel genes for ALS such as LUM and CRYM. We have also highlighted the analytical challenges of large-scale sequencing screens to detect disease-causing variants.

Saxitoxin contamination has also been shown to be a threat to human health in several reported cases, even resulting in death. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of animal (Neuro-2A) and algal (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) bioassays to saxitoxin effect. Neuro-2A cells were found to be sensitive to saxitoxin, as shown by a 24 h EC50 value of 1.5 nM, which was obtained using a cell viability assay. Conversely, no saxitoxin effect was found in any of the algal biomarkers evaluated, for the concentration range tested (2-128 nM). These results indicate that saxitoxin may induce toxic effects in animal and human populations at concentrations where phytoplankton communities are not affected. Therefore, when evaluating STX risk of toxicity, algal bioassays do not appear to be reliable indicators and should always be conducted in combination with animal bioassays. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The LH may be specialized for increasing sexual tension, whereas the RH may be specialized for release of this tension (orgasm), the former being catabolic and the latter anabolic. Several other interpretations of the findings are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Suffren, Sabrina; Braun, Claude M.

Abolishing this LTP interferes with drug-seeking behavior. Endocannabinoids (ECs) can be released by DA neurons in response to repetitive activation, which can inhibit glutamate release. Therefore, we hypothesized that ECs may act as negative regulators of LTP. Here we tested the induction of LTP in DA neurons of the VTA in mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. Immunohistochemistry showed colocalization of CB1 receptors with vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT)1 in terminals near DA neuron dendrites, with less extensive colocalization with VGLUT2. In addition, a CB1 receptor agonist, as well as trains of stimulation leading to EC production, decreased glutamate release onto DA neurons. We found that blocking CB1 receptors or synthesis of the EC 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) was without effect on basal excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude; however, it facilitated the induction of LTP. As previously reported, antagonizing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) transmission also facilitated LTP induction. Combining GABA(A) and CB1 receptor antagonists did not lead to larger LTP. LTP induced in the presence of CB1 receptor blockade was prevented by an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist. Our observations argue in favor of the hypothesis that 2-AG acts as a negative regulator of LTP in the VTA. Understanding the factors that regulate long-term synaptic plasticity in this circuit is critical to aid our comprehension of drug addiction in humans.

In view of recent findings concerning the cognitive effects of serotonin manipulations, we used AID in fourteen depressed patients to investigate whether cognitive effects following AID predict symptom changes. We found that symptom improvement 24 h after ATD was associated with an improved recall of positive words and with less attentional bias and recall of negative words, 5 h after ATD. These results indicate that serotonergic alterations affect emotional processing which may subsequently lead to symptom changes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

A drug called BA-210 (trademarked as Cethrin (R)) blocks activation of Rho and has shown promise in pre-clinical animal studies in being used to treat spinal cord injury (SCI). This is a report of a Phase I/IIa clinical study designed to test the safety and tolerability of the drug, and the neurological status of patients following the administration of a single dose of BA-210 applied during surgery following acute SCI. Patients with thoracic (T2-T12) or cervical (C4-T1) SCI were sequentially recruited for this dose-ranging (0.3 mg to 9 mg Cethrin), multi-center study of 48 patients with complete American Spinal Injury Association assessment (ASIA) A. Vital signs; clinical laboratory tests; computed tomography (CT) scans of the spine, head, and abdomen; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, and ASIA assessment were performed in the pre-study period and in follow-up periods out to 1 year after treatment. The treatment-emergent adverse events that were reported were typical for a population of acute SCI patients, and no serious adverse events were attributed to the drug. The pharmacokinetic analysis showed low levels of systemic exposure to the drug, and there was high inter-patient variability. Changes in ASIA motor scores from baseline were low across all dose groups in thoracic patients (1.8 +/- 5.1) and larger in cervical patients (18.6 +/- 19.3). The largest change in motor score was observed in the cervical patients treated with 3 mg of Cethrin in whom a 27.3 +/- 13.3 point improvement in ASIA motor score at 12 months was observed. Approximately 6% of thoracic patients converted from ASIA A to ASIA C or D compared to 31% of cervical patients and 66% for the 3-mg cervical cohort. Although the patient numbers are small, the observed motor recovery in this open-label trial suggests that BA-210 may increase neurological recovery after complete SCI. Further clinical trials with Cethrin in SCI patients are planned, to establish evidence of efficacy.

In a low-dose model of paclitaxel-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy in the rat, we have shown that the drug causes degeneration of intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENFs), i.e. the fibers which give rise to the sensory afferent's terminal receptor arbor. However, we did not find any evidence for axonal degeneration in samples taken at the mid-nerve level. Here we aimed to determine whether the absence of degenerating peripheral nerve axons was due to sampling a level that was too proximal. We used electron microscopy to study the distal-most branches of the nerves innervating the hind paw glabrous skin of normal and paclitaxel-treated rats. We confirmed that we sampled at a time when IENF degeneration was prominent. Because degeneration might be easier to detect with higher paclitaxel doses, we examined a four-fold cumulative dose range (8-32 mg/kg). We found no evidence of degeneration in the superficial subepidermal axon bundles (sSAB) that are located just a few microns below the epidermal basal lamina. Specifically, for all three dose groups there was no change in the number of sSAB per millimeter of epidermal border, no change in the number of axons per sSAB and no change in the diameter of sSAB axons. We conclude that paclitaxel produces a novel type of lesion that is restricted to the afferent axon's terminal arbor; we name this lesion 'terminal arbor degeneration'.

We aimed to assess the contributions of these risk factors and the effect of established precursors of multiple sclerosis, such as brain lesions on MRI and oligoclonal bands in CSF at the time of incident demyelination, on development of multiple sclerosis in children. Methods In our prospective national cohort study, we assessed children who presented with incident CNS demyelination to any of the 16 paediatric health-care facilities or seven regional health-care facilities in Canada. We did univariate and multivariable analyses to assess contributions of HLA-DRB1*15, Epstein-Barr virus, vitamin D status, Mill evidence of brain lesions, and CSF oligoclonal bands as determinants of multiple sclerosis. We used classification and regression tree analyses to generate a risk stratification algorithm for clinical use. Findings Between Sept 1, 2004, and June 30, 2010, we screened 332 children of whom 302 (91%) were eligible and followed-up for a median of 3.14 years (IQR 1.61-4.51). 63 (21%) children were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis after a median of 127 days (99-222). Although the risk of multiple sclerosis was increased with presence of one or more HLA-DRB1*15 alleles (hazard ratio [FIR] 2.32, 95% CI 1.25-4.30), reduced serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration (HR per 10 nmol/L decrease 1.11, 1.00-1.25), and previous Epstein-Barr-virus infection (FIR 2.04, 0.99-4.20), no interactions between these variables were detected on multivariate analysis. Multiple sclerosis was strongly associated with baseline MRI evidence of one or more brain lesion (HR 37.9, 5.26-273.85) or C SF oligoclonal bands (6.33, 3.35-11.96), suggesting established disease. One patient diagnosed with multiple sclerosis had a normal Mill scan, and therefore sensitivity of an abnormal MRI scan for multiple sclerosis diagnosis was 98.4%. Interpretation Risk of multiple sclerosis in children can be stratified by presence of HLA-DRB1*15 alleles, remote Epstein-Barr virus infection, and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Similar to previous studies in adults, brain lesions detected on Mill and CSF oligoclonal bands in children are probable precursors to the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis. Children with a normal MRI are very likely to have a monophasic illness.

Canadian Critical Care Translati	Severe traumatic brain injury in children elevates glial fibrillary acidic protein in cerebrospinal fluid and serum	PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; glial fibrillary acidic protein; biomarker; cerebrospinal fluid; serum; therapeutic hypothermia	PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE-CARE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; SENSITIVE ELISA; HEAD-INJURY; S100B; CSF; DAMAGE; GFAP; BIOMARKER	Objectives: 1) To determine the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in both cerebrospinal fluid and serum; 2) to determine whether serum GFAP levels correlate with functional outcome; and 3) to determine whether therapeutic hypothermia, as compared with normothermia, alters serum GFAP levels in children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: Laboratory-based analyses; postrandomized, controlled trial. Setting: Four Canadian pediatric intensive care units and a university-affiliated laboratory. Patients: Twenty-seven children, aged 2-17 yrs, with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score of <= 8). Interventions: Hypothermia therapy (32.5 degrees C) for 24 hrs with cooling started within 8 hrs of injury and rewarming at a rate of 0.5 degrees C every 2 hrs or normothermia (37.0 degrees C). Measurements and Main Results: GFAP was measured in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of GFAP were maximal on day 1 post-TBI, with cerebrospinal fluid GFAP (15.5 +/- 6.1 ng/mL) 25-fold higher than serum GFAP (0.6 +/- 0.2 ng/mL). Cerebro-spinal fluid GFAP normalized by day 7, whereas serum GFAP decreased gradually to reach a steady state by day 10. Serum GFAP measured on day 1 correlated with Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores determined at 6 months post-TBI rho = 0.527; p = .008) but failed to correlate with the injury scoring on admission, physiologic variables, or indices of injury measured on computerized tomography imaging. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for pediatric intensive care unit day 1 serum GFAP in determining good outcome were 0.80 (pediatric cerebral performance category, 1-2; normal-mild disability) and 0.91 (pediatric cerebral performance category, 1-3; normal-moderate disability). For a serum GFAP cutoff level of 0.6 ng/mL, sensitivity and specificity were 88% to 90% and 43% to 71%, respectively. Serum GFAP levels were similar among children randomized to either therapeutic hypothermia or normothermia. Conclusions: GFAP was markedly elevated in cerebrospinal fluid and serum in children after severe TBI and serum GFAP measured on pediatric intensive care unit day 1 correlated with functional outcome at 6 months. Hypothermia therapy did not alter serum GFAP levels compared with normothermia after severe TBI in children. Serum GFAP concentration, together with other biomarkers, may have prognostic value after TBI in children.

With the exception of song learning in birds, the hypothesis that cognitive traits are under sexual selection has received attention only recently. Here, we evaluate the evidence for this hypothesis in nonhuman vertebrates. We first briefly review the literature on brain development, which shows that cognition may be a sensitive indicator of early developmental conditions. We then consider the empirical evidence that females choose mates with better cognitive skills, which may be reflected in males' courtship displays, foraging performance, courtship feeding, or diet-dependent morphological traits. There is very little research that assesses whether females discriminate between males through direct observation of cognitively demanding behavior. Instead, several studies support female choice on the basis of morphological traits correlated with cognitive abilities. We conclude by highlighting key questions for future research: 1) To what extent do cognitive skills determine foraging success, courtship feeding, and the expression of diet-dependent morphological traits? 2) Do behavioral courtship displays depend on motor development and physiological maturation or learning through practice and experience? 3) How do cognitive abilities affect survival and mating success? Studies on a range of vertebrate taxa, with their diverse mating systems and cognitive ecologies, offer great potential to tackle these questions and deepen our understanding of sexual selection on cognition.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of S1P receptors in a non-T-cell model of demyelination, the cuprizone (cupr) model in C57BL/6 mice. Treatment with FTY720 (1 mg/kg) led to attenuated injury to OLGs, myelin, and axons in the corpus callosum (percentage of myelinated fibers was 44.7% in cupr-water and 63% in cupr-FTY720). Reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis were ameliorated when FTY720 was given from d 1, but astrogliosis was augmented when FTY720 was given from wk 4-9. FTY720 did not promote remyelination in this model. The protective effect of FTY720 was associated with decreased interleukin-1 beta and CCL2 transcripts in the corpus callosum, as well as altered S1P1 expression. Targeted deletion of S1P1 in OLG lineage cells did not lead to obvious clinical phenotype, but resulted in subtle abnormalities in myelin and an increased susceptibility to cupr-induced demyelination. We conclude that S1P receptors expressed by neuroglia are involved in regulating the response to injury, and CNS effects of FTY720 could contribute to its favorable therapeutic response in multiple sclerosis.-Kim, H.

The presence of the apolipoprotein E (apoE) epsilon 4 allele is a well-established genetic modifier (risk factor) of sporadic AD. In this review, we provide an update on the implications of apoE for the neurobiology and epidemiology of AD. Moreover, recent evidence is adduced indicating that (i) many AD risk factors are potentially modifiable by adaptive lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy and (ii) the potency of these modifiable AD determinants and responsiveness to intervention are often significantly impacted by the presence or absence of the epsilon 4 allele. Delineation of the influences of the APOE genotype on modifiable AD risk factors and prevention may spur consideration of APOE testing for presymptomatic individuals seeking to define their personal risk.

We measured caudate, putamen, thalamus, and amygdala GM volume using probabilistic a-priori regions of interest (ROIs) in 53 early FTLD patients (38 behavioral variant FTD [bvFTD], 9 Semantic Dementia [SD], 6 Progressive Non-Fluent Aphasia [PNFA]), and 25 age-matched healthy controls (HC). ANOVA showed significant (P<0.001) main effect of diagnosis, and significant interactions for diagnosis and region, and diagnosis and hemisphere. Post-hoc comparisons with HC showed bilateral GM atrophy in the caudate, putamen and thalamus, in bvFTD; a left-confined GM reduction in the amygdala in SD; and bilateral GM atrophy in the caudate and thalamus, and left-sided GM reduction in the putamen and amygdala in PNFA. Correlation analyses suggested an association between GM volumes and language, psychomotor speed and behavioral disturbances. This study showed a widespread involvement of subcortical and deep cortical GM in early FTLD with patterns specific for clinical entity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Neurophysiologic and neurobehavioral evidence of beneficial effects of prenatal omega-3 fatty acid intake on memory function at school age	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article							POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; PRETERM INFANTS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; DOUBLE-BLIND; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS; METHYLMERCURY EXPOSURE	Background: The beneficial effects of prenatal and early postnatal intakes of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on cognitive development during infancy are well recognized. However, few studies have examined the extent to which these benefits continue to be evident in childhood. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the relation of n-3 PUFAs and seafood-contaminant intake with memory function in school-age children from a fish-eating community. Design: In a prospective, longitudinal study in Arctic Quebec, we assessed Inuit children (n = 154; mean age: 11.3 y) by using a continuous visual recognition task to measure 2 event-related potential components related to recognition memory processing: the FN400 and the late positive component (LPC). Children were also examined by using 2 well-established neurobehavioral assessments of memory: the Digit span forward from Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children, 4th edition, and the California Verbal Learning TestChildren's Version. Results: Repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed that children with higher cord plasma concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is an important n-3 PUFA, had a shorter FN400 latency and a larger LPC amplitude; and higher plasma DHA concentrations at the time of testing were associated with increased FN400 amplitude. Cord DHA-related effects were observed regardless of seafood-contaminant amounts. Multiple regression analyses also showed positive associations between cord DHA concentrations and performance on neurobehavioral assessments of memory. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study provides the first neurophysiologic and neurobehavioral evidence of long-term beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA intake in utero on memory function in school-age children.

The present study examined whether this fronto-striatal contribution to the planning and execution of set-shifts is similar in a modified sorting task in which lexical rules are applied to word stimuli. Young healthy adults were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing the newly developed lexical version of the WCST: the Wisconsin Word Sorting Task. Significant activation was found in a cortico-striatal loop that includes area 47/12 of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the caudate nucleus during the planning of a set-shift, and in another that includes the posterior PFC and the putamen during the execution of a set-shift. However, in the present lexical task, additional activation peaks were observed in area 45 of the ventrolateral PFC area during both matching periods. These results provide evidence that the functional contributions of the various fronto-striatal loops are not dependent on the modality of the information to be manipulated but rather on the specific executive processes required.

Targeted temperature management in critical care: A report and recommendations from five professional societies	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						temperature; consensus; cardiac arrest; targeted temperature management; hypothermia	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST; MILD HYPOTHERMIA THERAPY; FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; WHOLE-BODY HYPOTHERMIA; SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; EXPERIMENTAL STROKE; NEONATAL ENCEPHALOPATHY; CLINICAL-TRIAL	Objective: Representatives of five international critical care societies convened topic specialists and a nonexpert jury to review, assess, and report on studies of targeted temperature management and to provide clinical recommendations. Data Sources: Questions were allocated to experts who reviewed their areas, made formal presentations, and responded to questions. Jurors also performed independent searches. Sources used for consensus derived exclusively from peer-reviewed reports of human and animal studies. Study Selection: Question-specific studies were selected from literature searches; jurors independently determined the relevance of each study included in the synthesis. Conclusions and Recommendations: 1) The jury opines that the term "targeted temperature management" replace "therapeutic hypothermia." 2) The jury opines that descriptors (e. g., "mild") be replaced with explicit targeted temperature management profiles. 3) The jury opines that each report of a targeted temperature management trial enumerate the physiologic effects anticipated by the investigators and actually observed and/or measured in subjects in each arm of the trial as a strategy for increasing knowledge of the dose/duration/response characteristics of temperature management. This enumeration should be kept separate from the body of the report, be organized by body systems, and be made without assertions about the impact of any specific effect on the clinical outcome. 4) The jury STRONGLY RECOMMENDS targeted temperature management to a target of 32 degrees C-34 degrees C as the preferred treatment (vs. unstructured temperature management) of out-of-hospital adult cardiac arrest victims with a first registered electrocardiography rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia and still unconscious after restoration of spontaneous circulation (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). 5) The jury WEAKLY RECOMMENDS the use of targeted temperature management to 33 degrees C-35.5 degrees C (vs. less structured management) in the treatment of term newborns who sustained asphyxia and exhibit acidosis and/or encephalopathy (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

Intellectual disability without epilepsy associated with STXBP1 disruption	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						STXBP1; epilepsy; intellectual deficiency; mental retardation	MENTAL-RETARDATION; MUTATIONS; FUSION	STXBP1 (Munc18-1) is a component of the machinery involved in the fusion of secretory vesicles to the presynaptic membrane for the release of neurotransmitters. De novo missense mutations in STXBP1 were recently reported in patients with Ohtahara syndrome, a form of encephalopathy with severe early-onset epilepsy. In addition, sequencing of the coding region of STXBP1 in 95 patients with non-syndromic intellectual disability (NSID) revealed de novo truncating mutations in two patients who also showed severe non-specific epilepsy, suggesting that STXBP1 disruption has the potential of causing a wide spectrum of epileptic disorders in association with intellectual disability. Here, we report on the mutational screening of STXBP1 in a different series of 50 patients with NSID and the identification of a novel de novo truncating mutation (c.1206delT/p.Y402X) in a male with NSID, but surprisingly with no history of epilepsy. This is the first report of a patient with a truncating mutation in STXBP1 that does not show epilepsy, thus, expanding the clinical spectrum associated with STXBP1 disruption.

Neurotrophins appear to play important roles in preantral follicles. Data on ovarian NT3 and its receptor TrkC are sparse in humans. Design: Immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction study of the expression of the NT3 system in human ovaries. Setting: Major tertiary-care academic center. Patient(s): Fifteen patients who underwent pregnancy terminations and 36 girls and women who underwent laparoscopies for ovarian surgery. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measure(s): Laboratory analysis of human ovaries. Result(s): NT3 protein staining was identified in oocytes and granulosa cells (GCs) of all samples tested. TrkC protein staining was present in oocytes and GCs of the majority of the fetal samples and in oocytes and GCs of all samples from girls and women. The messenger RNA transcripts for the full-length TrkC isoform were identified in oocytes of the majority of the fetal samples, in all the samples from the girls and women, and in GCs from the girls and women. The two NT3 isoforms and the three TrkC isoforms were identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in all ovarian extracts. Conclusion(s): The presence of NT3 and its TrkC receptor in human preantral follicles, and specifically in GCs, suggests that NT3 may be involved in early folliculogenesis, particularly in the activation of primordial follicles.

It is thus of interest to assess precisely MeHg exposure. The objective of this study was to estimate MeHg daily intake in exposed individuals using two different approaches, a food questionnaire and toxicokinetic modeling, and compare the complementary and use of each method. For this purpose, a group of 23 fishermen from northern Quebec provided blood and hair samples and answered a standard food questionnaire focusing on seafood consumption. A published and validated toxicokinetic model was then used to reconstruct MeHg daily intakes from mercury (Hg) measurements in biological samples. These intakes were compared to those estimated using a standard food questionnaire on seafood consumption. Daily intakes of MeHg from seafood (mean/median (range)) estimated from hair concentrations with the toxicokinetic-based approach were 6.1/5.2 (0.0-19) mu g/day. These intake values were on average six times lower than those estimated using a food questionnaire, that is, 49/32 (7.2-163) mu g/day. No correlation was found between the toxicokinetic-based and the questionnaire estimates of MeHg daily intakes. Most of the MeHg intakes estimated with the food questionnaire (21/23) exceeded the US EPA RfD of 0.1 mu g/kg bw/day, whereas only a small proportion (6/23) of modeled estimates exceeded the RfD. This study shows that human health risk estimates strongly depend on the chosen approach.

Stau1 is required for protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in hippocampal pyramidal cells. However, the role of Stau2 in synaptic plasticity remains unexplored. We found that unlike Stau1, Stau2 is not required for L-LTP. In contrast, Stau2, but not Stau1, is necessary for DHPG-induced protein synthesis-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). While Stau2 is involved in early development of spines, its down-regulation does not alter spine morphology or spontaneous miniature synaptic activity in older cultures where LTD occurs. In addition, Stau2, but not Stau1, knockdown reduces the dendritic localization of Map1b mRNA, a specific transcript involved in mGluR-LTD. Moreover, mGluR stimulation with DHPG induces Map1b, but not Map2, mRNA dissociation from mRNA granules containing Stau2 and the ribosomal protein P0. This dissociation was not observed in cells in which Stau2 was depleted. Finally, Stau2 knockdown reduces basal Map1b protein expression in den-drites and prevents DHPG-induced increases in dendritic Map1b protein level. We suggest a role for Stau2 in the generation and regulation of Map1b mRNA containing granules that are required for mGluR-LTD.

Most predictors have a minor influence on the long-term prognosis, and efforts are currently shifting toward finding relevant paraclinical predictors. By contrast, the study of prognostic factors has given some insights into the pathogenesis of MS, notably regarding the relation between relapses and long-term disability, and has emphasized the need to elucidate the exact mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration for the development of new therapeutic targets.

Conventional rehabilitation provides modest and sometimes delayed effects. Virtual reality (VR) technology is a novel adjunctive therapy that could be applied in neurorehabilitation. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the added benefit of VR technology on arm motor recovery after stroke. Methods-We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane literature from 1966 to July 2010 with the terms "stroke," " virtual reality," and " upper arm/extremity." We evaluated the effect of VR on motor function improvement after stroke. Results-From the 35 studies identified, 12 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria totaling 195 participants. Among them, there were 5 randomized clinical trials and 7 observational studies with a pre-/postintervention design. Interventions were delivered within 4 to 6 weeks in 9 of the studies and within 2 to 3 weeks in the remaining 3. Eleven of 12 studies showed a significant benefit toward VR for the selected outcomes. In the pooled analysis of all 5 randomized controlled trials, the effect of VR on motor impairment (Fugl-Meyer) was OR = 4.89 (95% CI, 1.31 to 18.3). No significant difference was observed for Box and Block Test or motor function. Among observational studies, there was a 14.7% (95% CI, 8.7%-23.6%) improvement in motor impairment and a 20.1% (95% CI, 11.0%-33.8%) improvement in motor function after VR.

Improving our understanding of the neuroscience underlying SBs, both attempts and completions, at all developmental stages is crucial for more effective preventive treatments and for better identification of vulnerable individuals. Recent studies have characterized SB using an endophenotype strategy, which aims to identify quantitative measures that reflect genetically influenced stable changes in brain function. In addition to aiding in the functional characterization of susceptibility genes, endophenotypic research strategies may have a wider impact in determining vulnerability to SB, as well as the translation of human findings to animal models, and vice versa. Endophenotypes associated with vulnerability to SB include impulsive/aggressive personality traits and disadvantageous decision making. Deficits in realistic risk evaluation represent key processes in vulnerability to SB. Serotonin dysfunction, indicated by neuroendocrine responses and neuroimaging, is also strongly implicated as a potential endophenotype and is linked with impulsive aggression and disadvantageous decision making. Specific endophenotypes may represent heritable markers for the identification of vulnerable patients and may be relevant targets for successful suicide prevention and treatments.

As a result, this has necessitated a greater understanding of the neurodevelopmental consequences of CBMs on child development. The aim of this study was to delineate the impact of CBMs on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. METHOD We conducted a cross-sectional study and systematically identified children with CBMs born between December 2000 and December 2006. We then performed follow-up magnetic resonance imaging studies, neurologic examination, and standardized neurodevelopmental outcome testing (Mullen Scales of Early Learning, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Child Behavior Checklist, Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). RESULTS Our sample comprised 49 children (29 males, 20 females; mean age, 28.4mo, SD 16.4) with a CBM. Infants with evidence of acquired fetal or neonatal brain injury, intracranial birth trauma, inherited metabolic disease, or major pre- or postnatal cerebral ischemia were excluded. Our findings highlight that children with CBMs experience a high prevalence of neurologic, developmental, and functional disabilities including motor, cognitive, language, and social-behavioral deficits, as well as poor quality of life. The associated supratentorial anomalies, chromosomal findings, and malformations affecting the cerebellar vermis were significant independent predictors of neurodevelopmental disabilities in young children with CBMs. The associated supratentorial anomalies and chromosomal findings were also predictive of global developmental delay (p = 0.01), cognitive impairment (p = 0.03), gross and fine motor delay (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01 respectively), and positive screening for autism spectrum disorder (p = 0.01). Additionally, malformations affecting the cerebellar vermis were significant independent predictors of expressive language (p = 0.04) and gross motor delays (p = 0.02). INTERPRETATION Developmental surveillance and early intervention programs should be an integral part of the long-term follow-up of survivors of CBM.

Vestibular control of the head: possible functions of the vestibulocollic reflex	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Vestibulocollic reflex; Head stabilization; Damping; Control systems; Efference copy	FREQUENCY-RESPONSE ANALYSIS; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; ORIENTING GAZE SHIFTS; INDUCED NECK REFLEX; MOTOR-TRACT AXONS; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; RETICULOSPINAL NEURONS; SEMICIRCULAR CANALS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; ALERT CATS	Here, we review the angular vestibulocollic reflex (VCR) focusing on its function during unexpected and voluntary head movements. Theoretically, the VCR could (1) stabilize the head in space during body movements and/or (2) dampen head oscillations that could occur as a result of the head's underdamped mechanics. The reflex appears unaffected when the simplest, trisynaptic VCR pathways are severed. The VCR's efficacy varies across species; in humans and monkeys, head stabilization is ineffective during low-frequency body movements in the yaw plan. While the appearance of head oscillations after the attenuation of semicircular canal function suggests a role in damping, this interpretation is complicated by defects in the vestibular input to other descending motor pathways such as gaze premotor circuits. Since the VCR should oppose head movements, it has been proposed that the reflex is suppressed during voluntary head motion. Consistent with this idea, vestibular-only (VO) neurons, which are possible vestibulocollic neurons, respond vigorously to passive, but not active, head rotations. Although VO neurons project to the spinal cord, their contribution to the VCR remains to be established. VCR cancelation during active head movements could be accomplished by an efference copy signal negating afferent activity related to active motion. Oscillations occurring during active motion could be eliminated by some combination of reflex actions and voluntary motor commands that take into account the head's biomechanics. A direct demonstration of the status of the VCR during active head movements is required to clarify the function of the reflex.

Nonrenewal spike train statistics: causes and functional consequences on neural coding	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Neural code; Information theory; Interspike interval correlations; Nonrenewal; Weakly electric fish; Model; Noise shaping	NEURONS IN-VIVO; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; INTERSPIKE INTERVAL CORRELATIONS; STOCHASTIC POINT PROCESSES; P-TYPE ELECTRORECEPTORS; WEAK SENSORY SIGNALS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; FREQUENCY ADAPTATION; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION	Many neurons display significant patterning in their spike trains (e.g. oscillations, bursting), and there is accumulating evidence that information is contained in these patterns. In many cases, this patterning is caused by intrinsic mechanisms rather than external signals. In this review, we focus on spiking activity that displays nonrenewal statistics (i.e. memory that persists from one firing to the next). Such statistics are seen in both peripheral and central neurons and appear to be ubiquitous in the CNS. We review the principal mechanisms that can give rise to nonrenewal spike train statistics. These are separated into intrinsic mechanisms such as relative refractoriness and network mechanisms such as coupling with delayed inhibitory feedback. Next, we focus on the functional roles for nonrenewal spike train statistics. These can either increase or decrease information transmission. We also focus on how such statistics can give rise to an optimal integration timescale at which spike train variability is minimal and how this might be exploited by sensory systems to maximize the detection of weak signals. We finish by pointing out some interesting future directions for research in this area. In particular, we explore the interesting possibility that synaptic dynamics might be matched with the nonrenewal spiking statistics of presynaptic spike trains in order to further improve information transmission.

The ability to distinguish inputs that are a consequence of our own actions (i.e., active motion) from those that result from changes in the external world (i.e., passive or unexpected motion) is essential for perceptual stability and accurate motor control. Recent work has made progress toward understanding how the brain distinguishes between these two kinds of sensory inputs. We have performed a series of experiments in which single-unit recordings were made from vestibular afferents and central neurons in alert macaque monkeys during rotation and translation. Vestibular afferents showed no differences in firing variability or sensitivity during active movements when compared to passive movements. In contrast, the analyses of neuronal firing rates revealed that neurons at the first central stage of vestibular processing (i.e., in the vestibular nuclei) were effectively less sensitive to active motion. Notably, however, this ability to distinguish between active and passive motion was not a general feature of early central processing, but rather was a characteristic of a distinct group of neurons known to contribute to postural control and spatial orientation. Our most recent studies have addressed how vestibular and proprioceptive inputs are integrated in the vestibular cerebellum, a region likely to be involved in generating an internal model of self-motion. We propose that this multimodal integration within the vestibular cerebellum is required for eliminating self-generated vestibular information from the subsequent computation of orientation and posture control at the first central stage of processing.

Cross-axis adaptation improves 3D vestibulo-ocular reflex alignment during chronic stimulation via a head-mounted multichannel vestibular prosthesis	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Vestibular nerve; Vestibular prosthesis; Vestibular implant; Vestibulo-ocular reflex, VOR, labyrinth; Bilateral vestibular deficiency; Areflexia; Adaptation; Electrical stimulation	SEMICIRCULAR CANAL PROSTHESIS; ROTATED VISUAL-FIELD; EYE-MOVEMENTS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; NERVE-STIMULATION; HIGH-ACCELERATION; DIRECTIONAL PLASTICITY; SACCULAR STIMULATION; OCULOMOTOR REACTIONS; UTRICULAR NERVE	By sensing three-dimensional (3D) head rotation and electrically stimulating the three ampullary branches of a vestibular nerve to encode head angular velocity, a multichannel vestibular prosthesis (MVP) can restore vestibular sensation to individuals disabled by loss of vestibular hair cell function. However, current spread to afferent fibers innervating non-targeted canals and otolith end organs can distort the vestibular nerve activation pattern, causing misalignment between the perceived and actual axis of head rotation. We hypothesized that over time, central neural mechanisms can adapt to correct this misalignment. To test this, we rendered five chinchillas vestibular deficient via bilateral gentamicin treatment and unilaterally implanted them with a head-mounted MVP. Comparison of 3D angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) responses during 2 Hz, 50A degrees/s peak horizontal sinusoidal head rotations in darkness on the first, third, and seventh days of continual MVP use revealed that eye responses about the intended axis remained stable (at about 70% of the normal gain) while misalignment improved significantly by the end of 1 week of prosthetic stimulation. A comparable time course of improvement was also observed for head rotations about the other two semicircular canal axes and at every stimulus frequency examined (0.2-5 Hz). In addition, the extent of disconjugacy between the two eyes progressively improved during the same time window. These results indicate that the central nervous system rapidly adapts to multichannel prosthetic vestibular stimulation to markedly improve 3D aVOR alignment within the first week after activation. Similar adaptive improvements are likely to occur in other species, including humans.

The rodent retina represents an interesting and valuable model for studying CNS development, because it contains well-identified cell types with clearly established and distinct developmental timelines. Very little is known about the distribution or function of CB1R in the developing retina. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of CB1R in the rat retina during all stages of postnatal development. Western blots were performed on retinal tissue at different time points between P1 and adulthood. In order to identify the cells expressing the receptor and the age at which this expression started, immunohistochemical co-staining was carried out for CB1R and markers of the different cell types comprising the retina. CB1R was already present at P1 in various cell types, i.e., ganglion, amacrine, horizontal, and mitotic cells. In the course of development, it appeared in cone photoreceptors and bipolar cells. For some cell types (bipolar, Muller, and some amacrine cells), CB1R was transiently expressed, suggesting a potential role of this receptor in developmental processes, such as migration, morphological changes, sub-identity acquisition, and patterned retinal spontaneous activity. Our results also indicated that CB1R is largely expressed in the adult retina (cone photoreceptors and horizontal, most amacrine, and retinal ganglion cells), and may therefore contribute to retinal functions. Overall these results indicate that, as shown in other structures of the brain, CB1R could play an instrumental role in the development and function of the retina. J. Comp.

Thus, females reared by low licking and grooming (LG) mothers are sexually more receptive to males, showing higher lordosis ratings, and are more motivated to mate compared to female offspring of high LG mothers. In the present study, we investigated the effect of natural variations in maternal care on the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) cell population and on the reproductive success of the female rat. Immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated oestrogen-receptor (pER) alpha and progesterone receptor (PR) were used to study the VMHvl of female offspring of high and low LG mothers at pro-oestrus and dioestrus. A second experiment investigated sexual behaviour and the effect of mating on c-Fos expression in the VMHvl of pro-oestrus and ovariectomised high and how female offspring. Lastly, we investigated the maternal effect on the establishment of the progestational state. A greater number of VMHvl pER alpha immunoreactive cells was found in the pro-oestrous female offspring of low LG mothers and PR was most abundant at pro-oestrus compared to dioestrus in both high and low LG females. Interestingly it is the less receptive high females that show the greater c-Fos expression in the VMH after mating in the pro-oestrous group. The difference in c-Fos expression after mating disappeared when the two groups were ovariectomised and received steroid replacement. Finally, low LG female offspring reached pseudopregnancy more often when receiving only seven intromissions at a 5-min interval compared to high LG females. Lower levels of maternal care may favour the reproductive success of low LG offspring by increasing pER alpha and oestrogen-dependent lordosis behaviour and lowering c-Fos after mating, resulting in inhibition of termination of oestrus.

Age-related alterations in the modular organization of structural cortical network by using cortical thickness from MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							BRAIN FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OLDER-ADULTS; DEFAULT MODE; HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION; TOPOLOGICAL PATTERNS; LIFE-SPAN	Normal aging is accompanied by various cognitive functional declines. Recent studies have revealed disruptions in the coordination of large-scale functional brain networks such as the default mode network in advanced aging. However, organizational alterations of the structural brain network at the system level in aging are still poorly understood. Here, using cortical thickness, we investigated the modular organization of the cortical structural networks in 102 young and 97 normal aging adults. Brain networks for both cohorts displayed a modular organization overlapping with functional domains such as executive and auditory/language processing. However, compared with the modular organisation of young adults, the aging group demonstrated a significantly reduced modularity that might be indicative of reduced functional segregation in the aging brain. More importantly, the aging brain network exhibited reduced intra-/inter-module connectivity in modules corresponding to the executive function and the default mode network of young adults, which might be associated with the decline of cognitive functions in aging. Finally, we observed age-associated alterations in the regional characterization in terms of their intra/inter-module connectivity. Our results indicate that aging is associated with an altered modular organization in the structural brain networks and provide new evidence for disrupted integrity in the large-scale brain networks that underlie cognition.

Most studies on the functional significance of these neural changes have focused on motor behavior and few have addressed how long-term antipsychotic treatment might influence dopamine-mediated reward function. We asked, therefore, whether a clinically relevant antipsychotic treatment regimen would alter the incentive motivational properties of a reward cue. We assessed the ability of a Pavlovian-conditioned stimulus to function as a conditioned reward, as well as to elicit approach behavior in rats treated with haloperidol, either continuously (achieved via subcutaneous osmotic minipump) or intermittently (achieved via daily subcutaneous injections). Continuous, but not intermittent, treatment enhanced the ability of amphetamine to potentiate the conditioned reinforcing effects of a cue associated with water. This effect was not related to differences in the ability to attribute predictive value to a conditioned stimulus (as measured by conditioned approach behavior), but was potentially linked to the development of behavioral supersensitivity to amphetamine and to augmented amphetamine-induced immediate early-gene expression (c-fos and Nur77) in dorsal striatopallidal and striatonigral cells. By enhancing the ability of reward cues to control behavior and by intensifying dopamine-mediated striatopallidal and striatonigral cell activity, standard (ie, continuous) antipsychotic treatment regimens might exacerbate drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior in schizophrenia. Achieving regular but transiently high antipsychotic levels in the brain (as modeled in the intermittent condition) might be a viable option to prevent these changes. This possibility should be explored in the clinic.

They are widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and for the prevention of coronary heart disease. Recent studies suggest that statins have anti-inflammatory effects beyond their lipid-lowering properties. We sought to investigate whether statins could affect neuropathic pain by mediating nerve injury-associated inflammatory responses. The effects of hydrophilic rosuvastatin and lipophilic simvastatin were examined in the mouse partial sciatic nerve ligation model. Systemic daily administration of either statin from days 0 to 14 completely prevented the development of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. When administered from days 8 to 14 after injury, both statins dose-dependently reduced established hypersensitivity. After treatment, the effects of the statins were washed out within 2 to 7 days, depending on dose. Effects of both statins in alleviating mechanical allodynia were further confirmed in a different injury-associated neuropathic pain model, mental nerve chronic constriction, in rats. Both statins were able to abolish interleukin-1 beta expression in sciatic nerve triggered by nerve ligation. Additionally, quantitative analysis with Iba-1 and glial fibrillary acid protein immunoreactivity demonstrated that rosuvastatin and simvastatin significantly reduced the spinal microglial and astrocyte activation produced by sciatic nerve injury. The increase of interleukin-1 beta mRNA in the ipsilateral side of spinal cords was also reduced by the treatment of either statin. We identified a potential new application of statins in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The pain-alleviating effects of statins are likely attributable to their immunomodulatory effects.

RUNX1T1: A Novel Predictor of Liver Metastasis in Primary Pancreatic Endocrine Neoplasms	PANCREAS			English	Article						RUNX1T1; immunohistochemistry; predictor of metastasis; progression marker; pancreas; endocrine neoplasm	GASTROENTEROPANCREATIC NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; GENE-EXPRESSION; THERAPEUTIC TARGETS; BREAST-CANCER; CELLS; DIFFERENTIATION; PROTEIN; AML; IDENTIFICATION	Objectives: Using gene expression profiling on frozen primary pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs), we discovered RUNX1T1 as a leading candidate progression gene. This study was designed (1) to validate the differential expression of RUNX1T1 protein on independent test sets of metastatic and nonmetastatic PETs and (2) to determine if RUNX1T1 underexpression in primary tumors was predictive of liver metastases. Methods: Immunohistochemical expression of RUNX1T1 protein was quantified using Allred scores on archival metastatic (n = 13) and nonmetastatic (n = 24) primary adult PET tissues using custom-designed tissue microarrays. Wilcoxon rank sum/Fisher exact tests and receiver operating characteristic curves were used in the data analysis. Results: Median RUNX1T1 scores were 2 (2-7) and 6 (3-8) in metastatic versus nonmetastatic primaries (P < 0.0001). Eleven of 13 metastatic and 1 of 24 nonmetastatic primaries exhibited RUNX1T1-scores of 4 or less (P < 0.0001). Low RUNX1T1 expression was highly associated with hepatic metastases (P < 0.0001), whereas conventional histological criteria (Ki-67 index, mitotic rate, necrosis) were weakly associated with metastases (P = 0.08-0.15). Considering RUNX1T1 expression (Allred) score of 4 or less to be predictive, the sensitivity to predict hepatic metastases was 85%, with a specificity of 96%. Conclusions: RUNX1T1 protein is underexpressed in well-differentiated metastatic primary PETs relative to nonmetastatic primaries and emerges as a promising novel biomarker for prediction of liver metastases.

Parental anxiety following the birth of a very low birthweight (VLBW, < 1500 g) infant may impede their capacity to be sensitive to the infant's cues and adversely affect infant developmental outcomes. Methods: A sample of 88 mothers and their VLBW infants were recruited in the NICU; 57 were followed at 24 months corrected age. During the infant's hospitalization, mothers completed a self-report measure of trait anxiety. When the infants were 24 months corrected age, mother-child interaction was videotaped during free play at home. These videotaped observations were coded using Emotional Availability Scales. Child cognitive and behavioural outcomes were evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (II) and the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5-5. Results: Maternal anxiety in the NICU was found to be a significant and independent predictor of child cognitive development and internalizing behaviour problems, controlling for maternal education and neonatal morbidity. Conclusion: These results suggest that early intervention programmes targeting anxious mothers of VLBW infants are indicated, to promote optimal developmental outcomes.

We performed 3 case-control studies (1/symptom with asymptomatic plaques as control). On logistic regression, AmF was independently associated with severity of stenosis, percentage of pixels with gray levels 0 to 10 (PPCS1; measure of echolucency), and spatial gray level dependence matrices (SGLDM) information measure of correlation (IMC-1; texture); TIAs with PPCS1 (echolucency), SGLDM correlation, and skewness (both texture); and stroke with PPCS1, SGLDM correlation, and percentage of pixels with gray levels 11 to 20 (PPCS2; echolucency). The area under the curve of the regression-derived predicted probability for AmF, TIA, and stroke was 0.92, 0.82, and 0.85, respectively (all P < .001). Texture analysis can identify carotid plaques associated with a neurological event, improving the diagnostic value of echolucency measures.

The goal of this study was to compare changes in older adults' participation over time following a stroke as a function of the presence of deficits inmemory, visual perception, executive functions, visual attention or language. A total of 197 persons with stroke were assessed 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after discharge from an acute care hospital, rehabilitation unit or geriatric day hospital. The Assessment of Life Habits (ALH) was used to measure participation. Neuropsychological measures were used to assess the presence of a cognitive deficit in the domains of memory, visual perception, executive functions (inhibition), visual attention and language. Overall, results indicate that participation after a stroke improves over time after hospital discharge in spite of cognitive deficits. Changes in participation over time differed between unimpaired and impaired participants only for language and executive deficits in three domains: interpersonal relationships, community life and responsibilities. These results indicate that when returning to the community after a stroke, positive changes in participation over time are possible even with cognitive deficits.

Engagement of programmed death-1 (PD-1), expressed on activated T cells, by its ligands (PD-L1 or PD-L2) suppresses T-cell responses. Enhanced CNS PD-1 and PD-L1 expression has been documented in inflammatory murine models; however, human CNS data are still incomplete. We determined that human primary cultures of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, or neurons expressed low or undetectable PD-L1 under basal conditions, but inflammatory cytokines significantly induced such expression, especially on astrocytes and microglia. Blocking PD-L1 expression in astrocytes using specific siRNA led to significantly increased CD8 T-cell responses (proliferation, cytokines, lytic enzyme). Thus, our results establish that inflamed human glial cells can express sufficient and functional PD-L1 to inhibit CD8 T cell responses. Extensive immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem brain tissues demonstrated a significantly greater PD-L1 expression in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions compared with control tissues, which colocalized with astrocyte or microglia/macrophage cell markers. However, more than half of infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes in MS lesions did not express PD-1, the cognate receptor. Thus, our results demonstrate that inflamed human CNS cells such as in MS lesions express significantly elevated PD-L1, providing a means to reduce CD8 T cell responses, but most of these infiltrating immune cells are devoid of PD-1 and thus insensitive to PD-L1/L2. Strategies aimed at inducing PD-1 on deleterious activated human CD8 T cells that are devoid of this receptor could provide therapeutic benefits since PD-L1 is already increased in the target organ.

The normal anatomy of the MCN was evaluated on three cadaveric limbs and correlated with the US images obtained in 15 healthy subjects. Seven consecutive patients with MCN neuropathy were then evaluated with sonography using 17.5 and 12.5-MHz broadband linear array transducers. All patients had abnormal nerve conduction studies and underwent correlative MR imaging on a 1.5-T system. One-to-one comparison between cadaveric specimens and sonographic images showed that the MCN can be reliably identified from the axilla through the elbow, including the lateral antebrachial cutaneous (LAbC) nerve. In the patients group with MCN neuropathy, sonography allowed detection of a wide spectrum of abnormalities. In 5/7 cases, a spindle neuroma was depicted in continuity with the nerve. In one case, US identified focal swelling of the nerve and in another case US was negative. The neuroma was hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences in 75% of cases. In one patient, the nerve showed Gd-enhancement on fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequences. The nerve was never detected on unenhanced T1-scans. Owing to its small-size and out-of-plane course, the MCN may be more reliably depicted with sonography rather than with MR imaging. US is promising for evaluating traumatic injuries of the MCN. By providing unique information on the entire course of the nerve, US can be used as a valuable complement of clinical and electrophysiologic findings.

These cells were recruited to infarct site following ischemic injury and differentiated to a vascular lineage leading to de novo blood vessel formation. Here, we show that a sub-population of cardiac resident nestin((+)) cells can further differentiate to a neuronal-like fate in vivo following myocardial infarction. In the ischemically damaged rat heart, neurofilament-M(+) fibres were detected innervating the peri-infarct/infarct region and the preponderance of these fibres were physically associated with processes emanating from nestin((+)) cells. One week after isogenic heterotopic cardiac transplantation, the beating transplanted rat heart was devoid of neurofilament-M(+) fibre staining. The superimposition of an ischemic insult to the transplanted heart led to the de novo synthesis of neurofilament-M(+) fibres by cardiac resident nestin((+)) cells. Nerve growth factor infusion and the exposure of normal rats to intermittent hypoxia significantly increased the density of neurofilament-M(+) fibres in the heart. However, these newly formed neurofilament-M(+) fibres were not physically associated with nestin((+)) processes. These data highlight a novel paradigm of reparative fibrosis as a subpopulation of cardiac resident nestin((+)) cells directly contributed to neural remodelling of the peri-infarct/infarct region of the ischemically damaged rat heart via the de novo synthesis of neurofilament-M fibres.

J	Lee, YA; Goto, Y				Lee, Young-A; Goto, Yukiori			Neurodevelopmental Disruption of Cortico-Striatal Function Caused by Degeneration of Habenula Neurons	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; LATERAL HABENULA; FASCICULUS RETROFLEXUS; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; INHIBITORY INFLUENCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; DECISION-MAKING; RAT	Background: The habenula plays an important role on cognitive and affective functions by regulating monoamines transmission such as the dopamine and serotonin, such that its dysfunction is thought to underlie a number of psychiatric conditions. Given that the monoamine systems are highly vulnerable to neurodevelopmental insults, damages in the habenula during early neurodevelopment may cause devastating effects on the wide-spread brain areas targeted by monoamine innervations. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a battery of behavioral, anatomical, and biochemical assays, we examined the impacts of neonatal damage in the habenula on neurodevelopmental sequelae of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and associated behavioral deficits in rodents. Neonatal lesion of the medial and lateral habenula by ibotenic acid produced an assortment of behavioral manifestations consisting of hyper-locomotion, impulsivity, and attention deficit, with hyper-locomotion and impulsivity being observed only in the juvenile period, whereas attention deficit was sustained up until adulthood. Moreover, these behavioral alterations were also improved by amphetamine. Our study further revealed that impulsivity and attention deficit were associated with disruption of PFC volume and dopamine (DA) receptor expression, respectively. In contrast, hyper-locomotion was associated with decreased DA transporter expression in the NAcc. We also found that neonatal administration of nicotine into the habenula of neonatal brains produced selective lesion of the medial habenula. Behavioral deficits with neonatal nicotine administration were similar to those caused by ibotenic acid lesion of both medial and lateral habenula during the juvenile period, whereas they were different in adulthood. Conclusions/Significance: Because of similarity between behavioral and brain alterations caused by neonatal insults in the habenula and the symptoms and suggested neuropathology in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), these results suggest that neurodevelopmental deficits in the habenula and the consequent cortico-striatal dysfunctions may be involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of ADHD.

Variability of Brain Signals Processed Locally Transforms into Higher Connectivity with Brain Development	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; IN-VIVO; EEG; COMPLEXITY; CONSCIOUSNESS; INTEGRATION; MEG	A number of studies have characterized the changes in variability of brain signals with brain maturation from the perspective of considering the human brain as a complex system. Specifically, it has been shown that complexity of brain signals increases in development. On one hand, such an increase in complexity can be attributed to more specialized and differentiated brain regions able to express a higher repertoire of mental microstates. On the other hand, it can be explained by increased integration between widely distributed neuronal populations and establishment of new connections. The goal of this study was to see which of these two mechanisms is dominant, accounting for the previously observed increase in signal complexity. Using information-theoretic tools based on scalp-recorded EEG measurements, we examined the trade-off between local and distributed variability of brain signals in infants and children separated into age groups of 1-2, 2-8, 9 -24, and 24 -66 months old. We found that developmental changes were characterized by a decrease in the amount of information processed locally, with a peak in alpha frequency range. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the variability of brain signals processed as a distributed network. Complementary analysis of phase locking revealed an age-related pattern of increased synchronization in the lower part of the spectrum, up to the alpha rhythms. At the same time, we observed the desynchronization effects associated with brain development in the higher beta to lower gamma range.

Since ablation of neural elements is proposed as an adjunct to circumferential pulmonary vein ablation for AF, we investigated the short and long-term effects of mediastinal nerve ablation on AF inducibility. Under general anesthesia, in 11 dogs several mediastinal nerve sites were identified on the superior vena cava that, when stimulated electrically during the atrial refractory period, reproducibly initiated AF. Cryoablation of one nerve site was then performed and inducibility retested early (1-2 months post Cryo; n = 7) or late (4 months post Cryo; n = 4). Four additional dogs that underwent a sham procedure were retested 1 to 2 months post-surgery. Stimulation induced AF at 91% of nerve sites tested in control versus 21% nerve sites early and 54% late post-ablation (both P<0.05). Fewer stimuli were required to induce AF in controls versus the Early Cryo group; this capacity returned to normal values in the Late Cryo group. AF episodes were longer in control versus the Early or Late Cryo groups. Heart rate responses to vagal or stellate ganglion stimulation, as well as to local nicotine infusion into the right coronary artery, were similar in all groups. In conclusion, focal damage to intrinsic cardiac neuronal inputs causes short-term stunning of neuronal inducibility of AF without major loss of overall adrenergic or cholinergic efferent neuronal control. That recovery of AF inducibility occurs rapidly post-surgery indicates the plasticity of intrathoracic neuronal elements to focal injury. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The risk factors and implications of neurological side effects are not known. METHODS: Acute and late >= grade 3 neurological toxicities (NTs) were analysed among 2761 patients from 14 RTOG trials accrued from 1983 to 2003. The association between acute and late toxicity was analysed using a stepwise logistic regression model. The association between the occurrence of acute NT and survival was analysed as an independent variable. RESULTS: There were 2610 analysable patients (86% glioblastoma, 10% anaplastic astrocytoma). All received a systemic agent during radiation (83% chemotherapy, 17% biological agents). Median radiation dose was 60 Gy. There were 182 acute and 83 late NT events. On univariate analysis, older age, poor performance status, aggressive surgery, pre-existing neurological dysfunction, poor mental status and twice-daily radiation were associated with increased acute NT. In a stepwise logistic regression model the occurrence of acute NT was significantly associated with late NT (OR = 2.40; 95% CI = 1.2-4.8; P = 0.014). The occurrence of acute NT predicted poorer overall survival, independent of recursive partitioning analysis class (median 7.8 vs 11.8 months). INTERPRETATION: Acute NT is significantly associated with both late NT and overall survival.

Spatial intensity distribution analysis (SpIDA) is an image analysis method that can directly measure oligomerization and trafficking of endogenous proteins in single cells. Here, we show the use of SpIDA to quantify dimerization/activation and surface transport of receptor protein kinases-EGF receptor and TrkB-at early stages of their transactivation by several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Transactivation occurred on the same timescale and was directly limited by GPCR activation but independent of G-protein coupling types. Early receptor protein kinase transactivation and internalization were not interdependent for all receptor pairs tested, revealing heterogeneity between groups of GPCRs. SpIDA also detected transactivation of TrkB by dopamine receptors in intact neurons. By allowing for time and space resolved quantification of protein populations with heterogeneous oligomeric states, SpIDA provides a unique approach to undertake single cell multivariate quantification of signaling processes involving changes in protein interactions, trafficking, and activity.

The underlying mechanisms involve cocaine-mediated upregulation of adhesion molecules with subsequent disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recently, a novel activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) has been implicated in leukocyte transmigration across the endothelium. We now show that upregulation of ALCAM in the brain endothelium seen in HIV(+)/cocaine drug abusers paralleled increased CD68 immunostaining compared with HIV(+)/no cocaine or uninfected controls, suggesting the important role of ALCAM in promoting leukocyte infiltration across the BBB. Furthermore, ALCAM expression was increased in cocaine-treated mice with concomitant increase in monocyte adhesion and transmigration in vivo, which was ameliorated by pretreating with the neutralizing antibody to ALCAM, lending additional support to the role of ALCAM. This new concept was further confirmed by in vitro experiments. Cocaine-mediated induction of ALCAM in human brain microvascular endothelial cells through the translocation of sigma receptor to the plasma membrane, followed by phosphorylation of PDGF-beta (platelet-derived growth factor-beta) receptor. Downstream activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, Akt, and NF-kappa B (nuclear factor-kappa B) pathways resulted in induced expression of ALCAM. Functional implication of upregulated ALCAM was confirmed using cell adhesion and transmigration assays. Neutralizing antibody to ALCAM ameliorated this effect. Together, these findings implicate cocaine-mediated induction of ALCAM as a mediator of increased monocyte adhesion/transmigration into the CNS.

In the somatosensory, visual, and auditory modalities, SS-EPs are considered to constitute an electrophysiological correlate of cortical sensory networks resonating at the frequency of stimulation. In the present study, we describe and characterize, for the first time, SS-EPs elicited by the selective activation of skin nociceptors in humans. The stimulation consisted of 2.3-s-long trains of 16 identical infrared laser pulses (frequency, 7 Hz), applied to the dorsum of the left and right hand and foot. Two different stimulation energies were used. The low energy activated only C-nociceptors, whereas the high energy activated both A delta- and C-nociceptors. Innocuous electrical stimulation of large-diameter A beta-fibers involved in the perception of touch and vibration was used as control. The high-energy nociceptive stimulus elicited a consistent SS-EP, related to the activation of A delta-nociceptors. Regardless of stimulus location, the scalp topography of this response was maximal at the vertex. This was noticeably different from the scalp topography of the SS-EPs elicited by innocuous vibrotactile stimulation, which displayed a clear maximum over the parietal region contralateral to the stimulated side. Therefore, we hypothesize that the SS-EPs elicited by the rapid periodic thermal activation of nociceptors may reflect the activation of a network that is preferentially involved in processing nociceptive input and may thus provide some important insight into the cortical processes generating painful percepts.

Robo1 Regulates Semaphorin Signaling to Guide the Migration of Cortical Interneurons through the Ventral Forebrain	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; SENSORY NEURON AXONS; STRIATAL INTERNEURONS; DIRECT REPRESSION; BASAL FOREBRAIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; HORMONE NEURONS; MOUSE FOREBRAIN; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OLFACTORY-BULB	Cortical interneurons, generated predominantly in the medial ganglionic eminence, migrate around and avoid the developing striatum in the subpallium en route to the cortex. This is attributable to the chemorepulsive cues of class 3 semaphorins expressed in the striatal mantle and acting through neuropilin (Nrp1 and Nrp2) receptors expressed in these cells. Cortical interneurons also express Robo receptors, and we show here that in mice lacking Robo1, but not Robo2, these cells migrate aberrantly through the striatum. In vitro experiments demonstrated that interneurons lacking Robo1 function are significantly less responsive to the effects of semaphorins. Failure to respond to semaphorin appears to be attributable to a reduction in Nrp1 and PlexinA1 receptors within these cells. Biochemical studies further demonstrated that Robo1 binds directly to Nrp1, but not to semaphorins, and this interaction is mediated by a region contained within its first two Ig domains. Thus, we show for the first time that Robo1 interacts with Nrp1 to modulate semaphorin signaling in the developing forebrain and direct the migration of interneurons through the subpallium and into the cortex.

J	Radovanovic, I; Mullick, A; Gros, P				Radovanovic, Irena; Mullick, Alaka; Gros, Philippe			Genetic Control of Susceptibility to Infection with Candida albicans in Mice	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHRONIC MUCOCUTANEOUS CANDIDIASIS; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; INTERFERON-GAMMA; FUNGAL-INFECTIONS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; TH17-ASSOCIATED CYTOKINES; SYSTEMIC CANDIDIASIS; TISSUE-DAMAGE; RESISTANCE; TRANSCRIPTION	Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that causes acute disseminated infections in immunocompromised hosts, representing an important cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. To study the genetic control of susceptibility to disseminated C. albicans in mice, we phenotyped a group of 23 phylogenetically distant inbred strains for susceptibility to infection as measured by extent of fungal replication in the kidney 48 hours following infection. Susceptibility was strongly associated with the loss-of-function mutant complement component 5 (C5/Hc) allele, which is known to be inherited by approximately 40% of inbred strains. Our survey identified 2 discordant strains, AKR/J (C5-deficient, resistant) and SM/J (C5-sufficient, susceptible), suggesting that additional genetic effects may control response to systemic candidiasis in these strains. Haplotype association mapping in the 23 strains using high density SNP maps revealed several putative loci regulating the extent of C. albicans replication, amongst which the most significant were C5 (P value = 2.43x10(-11)) and a novel effect on distal chromosome 11 (P value = 7.63x10(-9)). Compared to other C5-deficient strains, infected AKR/J strain displays a reduced fungal burden in the brain, heart and kidney, and increased survival, concomitant with uniquely high levels of serum IFN gamma. C5-independent genetic effects were further investigated by linkage analysis in an [A/JxAKR/J] F2 cross (n = 158) where the mutant Hc allele is fixed. These studies identified a chromosome 11 locus (Carg4, Candida albicans resistance gene 4; LOD = 4.59), and a chromosome 8 locus (Carg3; LOD = 3.95), both initially detected by haplotype association mapping. Alleles at both loci were inherited in a co-dominant manner. Our results verify the important effect of C5-deficiency in inbred mouse strains, and further identify two novel loci, Carg3 and Carg4, which regulate resistance to C. albicans infection in a C5-independent manner.

Here we present a standard macaque monkey brain MRI template that offers a common stereotaxic reference frame to localize anatomical and functional information in an organized and reliable way for comparison across individual monkeys and studies. We have used MRI volumes from a group of 25 normal adult macaque monkeys (18 cynomolgus and 7 rhesus) to create a common standard macaque monkey brain as well as atlases for each of these species separately. In addition, the digital macaque monkey volume was subjected to 3D volumetric analysis and comparison of brain structures between the individual brains and the average atlas. Furthermore, we provide a means of transforming any macaque MRI volume into MNI monkey space coordinates in 3D using simple web based tools. Coordinates in MNI monkey space can also be transformed into the coordinate system of a detailed neuroanatomical paper atlas (Paxinos et al., 2008), enabling researchers to identify and delineate cortical and subcortical structures in their individual macaque monkey brains.

Cortical thickness has been previously associated with g. In the present study, we systematically analyzed associations between cortical thickness and cognitive performance with and without adjusting for the effects of g in a representative sample of children and adolescents (N = 207, Mean age = 11.8; SD = 3.5; Range = 6 to 18.3 years). Seven cognitive tests were included in a measurement model that identified three first-order factors (representing cognitive ability domains) and one second-order factor representing g. Residuals of the cognitive ability domain scores were computed to represent g-independent variance for the three domains and seven tests. Cognitive domain and individual test scores as well as residualized scores were regressed against cortical thickness, adjusting for age, gender and a proxy measure of brain volume. g and cognitive domain scores were positively correlated with cortical thickness in very similar areas across the brain. Adjusting for the effects of g eliminated associations of domain and test scores with cortical thickness. Within a psychometric framework, cortical thickness correlates of cognitive performance on complex tasks are well captured by g in this demographically representative sample. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Wavelet coherence is a popular method to construct a time-frequency map that can be used to analyze the time-frequency correlations between two time series. Coherence is a normalized measure of dependence, for which it is possible to construct confidence intervals, and that is commonly considered as being more interpretable than the wavelet cross-spectrum (WCS). In this paper, we provide empirical and theoretical arguments to show that a significant level of wavelet coherence does not necessarily correspond to a significant level of dependence between random signals, especially when the number of trials is small. In such cases, we demonstrate that the WCS is a much better measure of statistical dependence, and a new statistical test to detect significant values of the cross-spectrum is proposed. This test clearly outperforms the limitations of coherence analysis while still allowing a consistent estimation of the time-frequency correlations between two non-stationary stochastic processes. Simulated data are used to investigate the advantages of this new approach over coherence analysis.

In contrast to CMB, DMB display high levels of the low- affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75(NTR). Given the reports of a better clinical course of DMB, we hypothesized that p75(NTR) might act as a tumor suppressor in medulloblastomas. In a large set of medulloblastomas, p75(NTR) was screened for mutations, and its mRNA expression and the DNA methylation status of its 50- region were assessed. p75(NTR) immunostainings were performed in wild- type murine cerebella and medulloblastomas arising in patched heterozygous mice, and murine cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCP) were analyzed in vitro. Medulloblastoma cells engineered to express p75(NTR) were characterized flow cytometrically and morphologically. One CMB displayed a mutation of the p75(NTR) coding sequence. p75(NTR) mRNA levels clearly delineated DMB and CMB; however, CpG island hypermethylation was excluded as the cause of low p75(NTR) expression in CMB. Sonic Hedgehog- treated GCP showed elevated p75(NTR) expression, and strong expression of p75(NTR) was detected in the external granule cell layer of wild- type mice and in murine ptc 6 medulloblastomas. CMB cells overexpressing p75(NTR) displayed a significant increase in apoptosis. In summary, our data link activated Hedgehog signaling in DMB with p75(NTR) expression and characterize p75 NTR as a biologically relevant inductor of apoptosis in MB.

The extent to which this ability correlates with the organism's performance, and the neural processes underlying it, remain unclear. We trained monkeys to attend to a visual target that differed in rank along a color-ordinal scale from that of a distracter. The animals' performance at focusing attention on the target and filtering out the distracter improved as ordinal distance between the stimuli increased. Importantly, dIPFC neurons also improved their filtering performance with increasing ordinal target-distracter distance; they built up their response rate in anticipation of the target-distracter onset, and then units encoding target representations increased their firing rate by similar amounts, whereas units encoding distracter representations gradually suppressed their rates as the interstimulus ordinal distance increased. These results suggest that attentional-filtering performance in primates relies upon dIPFC neurons' ability to suppress distracter representations.

The most active NK1 antagonist of the series, 20 [Ac-Aba-Gly-NMe-3',5'-(CF(3))(2)-Bn], was then used in the design of a novel, potent chimeric opioid agonist-NK1 receptor antagonist, 35 [Dmt-D-Arg-Aba-Gly-NMe-3',5'-(CF(3))(2)-Bn], which combines the N terminus of the established Dmt(1)-DALDA agonist opioid pharmacophore (H-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH(2)) and 20, the NK1R ligand. The opioid component of the chimeric compound 35, that is, Dmt-D-Arg-Aba-Gly-NH(2) (36), also proved to be an extremely potent and balanced mu and delta opioid receptor agonist with subnanomolar binding and in vitro functional activity.

FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPRESSION OF DISTINCT MOVEMENT KINEMATICS IN MOTOR SEQUENCE LEARNING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fMRI; humans; motor control; sequence learning; putamen; cerebellum	BASAL GANGLIA; MULTIPLE MOVEMENTS; ACTION REPERTOIRES; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; BEAT PERCEPTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; FMRI; CONSOLIDATION; ORGANIZATION; REPRESENTATION	A broad range of motor skills, such as speech and writing, evolves with the ability to articulate elementary motor movements into novel sequences that come to be performed smoothly through practice. Neuroimaging studies in humans have demonstrated the involvement of the cerebello-cortical and striato-cortical motor loops in the course of motor sequence learning. Nonetheless, the nature of the improvement and brain mechanisms underlying different parameters of movement kinematics are not yet fully ascertained. We aimed at dissociating the cerebral substrates related to the increase in performance on two kinematic indices: velocity, that is the speed with which each single movement in the sequence is produced, and transitions, that is the duration of the gap between these individual movements. In this event-related fMRI experiment, participants practiced an eight-element sequence of finger presses on a keypad which allowed to record those kinematic movement parameters. Velocity was associated with activations in the ipsilateral spinocerebellum (lobules 4-5, 8 and medial lobule 6) and in the contralateral primary motor cortex. Transitions were associated with increased activity in the neocerebellum (lobules 6 bilaterally and lobule 4-5 ipsilaterally), as well as with activations within the right and left putamen and a broader bilateral network of motor cortical areas. These findings indicate that, rather than being the product of a single mechanism, the general improvement in motor performance associated with early motor sequence learning arises from at least two distinct kinematic processes, whose behavioral expressions are supported by partially overlapping and segregated brain networks.

J	Kingdom, FAA				Kingdom, Frederick A. A.			Lightness, brightness and transparency: A quarter century of new ideas, captivating demonstrations and unrelenting controversy	VISION RESEARCH			English	Review						Lightness; Brightness; Transparency; Illumination; Layer decomposition; Intrinsic images	DOUBLE-ANCHORING THEORY; ACHROMATIC COLOR-PERCEPTION; PERCEIVED SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; FILLING-IN; GRATING-INDUCTION; HUMAN-VISION; EDGE INTEGRATION; SIMULTANEOUS CONTRAST; FILTERING ACCOUNT	The past quarter century has witnessed considerable advances in our understanding of Lightness (perceived reflectance), Brightness (perceived luminance) and perceived Transparency (LBT). This review poses eight major conceptual questions that have engaged researchers during this period, and considers to what extent they have been answered. The questions concern 1. the relationship between lightness, brightness and perceived non-uniform illumination, 2. the brain site for lightness and brightness perception, 3 the effects of context on lightness and brightness, 4. the relationship between brightness and contrast for simple patch-background stimuli, 5. brightness "filling-in", 6. lightness anchoring, 7. the conditions for perceptual transparency, and 8. the perceptual representation of transparency. The discussion of progress on major conceptual questions inevitably requires an evaluation of which approaches to LBT are likely and which are unlikely to bear fruit in the long term, and which issues remain unresolved. It is concluded that the most promising developments in LBT are (a) models of brightness coding based on multi-scale filtering combined with contrast normalization, (b) the idea that the visual system decomposes the image into "layers" of reflectance, illumination and transparency, (c) that an understanding of image statistics is important to an understanding of lightness errors, (d) Whittle's log W metric for contrast-brightness, (e) the idea that "filling-in" is mediated by low spatial frequencies rather than neural spreading, and (f) that there exist multiple cues for identifying non-uniform illumination and transparency. Unresolved issues include how relative lightness values are anchored to produce absolute lightness values, and the perceptual representation of transparency. Bridging the gap between multi-scale filtering and layer decomposition approaches to LBT is a major task for future research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Natural Restoration of Critical Period Plasticity in the Juvenile and Adult Primary Auditory Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							OCULAR DOMINANCE PLASTICITY; VISUAL CORTICAL PLASTICITY; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; MONOCULAR DEPRIVATION; BALANCED INHIBITION; SENSITIVE PERIODS; RECOVERY; RAT; REPRESENTATIONS; REACTIVATION	Since its first description >40 years ago, the neurological "critical period" has been predominantly described as an early, plastic postnatal brain development stage that rather abruptly advances to an aplastic or less plastic "adult" stage. Here, we show that chronic exposure of juvenile or adult rats to moderate-level acoustic noise results in a broad reversal of maturational changes that mark the infant-to-adult progression in the primary auditory cortex. In time, noise exposure reinstates critical period plasticity. Cortical changes resulting from noise exposure are again reversed to reestablish a physically and functionally normal adult cortex, by returning animals to natural acoustic environments. These studies show that at least some of neurological changes believed to mark the transition from the infantile to the mature (adult) stage are, by their nature, reversible.

J	Marrelec, G; Fransson, P				Marrelec, Guillaume; Fransson, Peter			Assessing the Influence of Different ROI Selection Strategies on Functional Connectivity Analyses of fMRI Data Acquired During Steady-State Conditions	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRINCIPAL-COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BOLD SIGNAL FLUCTUATIONS; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; BRAIN-FUNCTION; CINGULATE CORTEX; DATA SETS; MRI DATA; INTERACTIVITY; ARCHITECTURE; INTEGRATION	In blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), assessing functional connectivity between and within brain networks from datasets acquired during steady-state conditions has become increasingly common. However, in contrast to connectivity analyses based on task-evoked signal changes, selecting the optimal spatial location of the regions of interest (ROIs) whose timecourses will be extracted and used in subsequent analyses is not straightforward. Moreover, it is also unknown how different choices of the precise anatomical locations within given brain regions influence the estimates of functional connectivity under steady-state conditions. The objective of the present study was to assess the variability in estimates of functional connectivity induced by different anatomical choices of ROI locations for a given brain network. We here targeted the default mode network (DMN) sampled during both resting-state and a continuous verbal 2-back working memory task to compare four different methods to extract ROIs in terms of ROI features (spatial overlap, spatial functional heterogeneity), signal features (signal distribution, mean, variance, correlation) as well as strength of functional connectivity as a function of condition. We show that, while different ROI selection methods produced quantitatively different results, all tested ROI selection methods agreed on the final conclusion that functional connectivity within the DMN decreased during the continuous working memory task compared to rest.

Opposing roles of PlexinA and PlexinB in axonal branch and varicosity formation	MOLECULAR BRAIN			English	Article							ACTIVE RAC; SEMAPHORIN RECEPTOR; STRUCTURAL BASIS; SENSORY NEURONS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DROSOPHILA; GUIDANCE; MECHANISMS; CONNECTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPUS	Establishing precise synaptic connectivity during development is crucial for neural circuit function. However, very few molecules have been identified that are involved in determining where and how many synapses form. The Plexin cell-surface molecules are a conserved family of axon guidance receptors that mediate axon fasciculation and repulsion during neural development, and later in development PlexinA receptors are involved in eliminating axonal branches and synapse numbers. Here we investigate the roles of PlexinA and PlexinB receptors in axonal branch and varicosity formation in Drosophila. We knocked down PlexinA or PlexinB expression using RNAi in identified mechanosensory neurons and analyzed axonal branching patterns and varicosity formations. Reducing PlexinA expression increased the axonal arbor complexity by increasing the number of branches and varicosities along the axon. In contrast, knocking down PlexinB expression decreased morphological complexity by decreasing the number of branches and the overall size of the axonal arbor, but did not reduce the number of varicosities. Our results demonstrate opposing roles for PlexinA and PlexinB in local wiring within a target region, where PlexinA functions to suppress excessive axonal branches and synapses and PlexinB facilitates axonal growth.

Genetic and environmental influences on structural variability of the brain in pediatric twin: Deformation based morphometry	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; Pediatric twin; Jacobian determinant; Genetic effect; Environmental effect; Structural equation modeling	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MONOZYGOTIC TWINS; SURFACE-AREA; MRI DATA; MORPHOLOGY; HERITABILITY; SEGMENTATION; REGISTRATION; ADOLESCENCE; CHILDHOOD	Twin studies are one of the most powerful study designs for estimating the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences on phenotypic variation inhuman brain morphology. In this study, we applied deformation based morphometry, a technique that provides a voxel-wise index of local tissue growth or atrophy relative to a template brain, combined with univariate ACE model, to investigate the genetic and environmental effects on the human brain structural variations in a cohort of homogeneously aged healthy pediatric twins. In addition, anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in order to explore global and regional genetic effects. ROI results showed that the influence of genetic factors on cerebrum (h(2) = 0.70), total gray matter (0.67), and total white matter (0.73) volumes were significant. In particular, structural variability of left-side lobar volumes showed a significant heritability. Several subcortical structures such as putamen (h(ROI)(2) = 0.79/0.77(L/R), h(MAX)(2) = 0.82/0.79) and globus pallidus (0.81/0.76, 0.88/0.82) were also significantly heritable in both voxel-wise and ROI-based results. In the voxel-wise results, lateral parts of right cerebellum (c(2) = 0.68) and the posterior portion of the corpus callosum (0.63) were rather environmentally determined, but it failed to reach statistical significance. Pediatric twin studies are important because they can discriminate several influences on developmental brain trajectories and identify relationships between gene and behavior. Several brain structures showed significant genetic effects and might therefore serve as biological markers for inherited traits, or as targets for genetic linkage and association studies.

However, the reported effects of CB1 blockade on performance for rewarding electrical brain stimulation stand out as an exception. By applying a novel method for conceptualizing and measuring reward seeking, we show that AM-251, a CB1 receptor antagonist, does indeed decrease performance for rewarding electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle in rats. Reward seeking depends on multiple sets of variables, including the intensity of the reward, its cost, and the value of competing rewards. In turn, reward intensity depends both on the sensitivity and gain of brain reward circuitry. We show that drug-induced changes in sensitivity cannot account for the suppressive effect of AM-251 on reward seeking. Therefore, the role of CB1 receptors must be sought among the remaining determinants of performance. Our analysis provides an explanation of the inconsistencies between prior reports, which likely arose from the following: (1) the averaging of data across subjects showing heterogeneous effects and (2) the use of methods that cannot distinguish between the different determinants of reward pursuit. By means of microdialysis, we demonstrate that blockade of CB1 receptors attenuates nucleus accumbens dopamine release in response to rewarding medial forebrain bundle stimulation, and we propose that this action is responsible for the ability of the drug to decrease performance for the electrical reward.

We find that, in several areas, these reports provide population-level arguments both for and against the use of cognitive enhancers. In discussing these arguments, we look at how these reports are indicative of potentially innovative frameworks-epidemiological, risk/benefit and socio-historical-by which to explore the public health impact of cognitive enhancement. Finally, we argue that these reports are suggestive of both tensions between the bioethical and public health approaches and are also indicative of how these two frameworks can, in part, be seen as complementary.

Bobath practitioners use hands-on approaches to elicit and reestablish typical movement patterns through therapist-controlled sensorimotor experiences within the context of task accomplishment. One aspect of Bobath practice, the recovery of sensorimotor function, is reviewed within the framework of current motor control theories. We focus on the role of sensory information in movement production, the relationship between posture and movement and concepts related to motor recovery and compensation with respect to this therapeutic approach. We suggest that a major barrier to the evaluation of the therapeutic effectiveness of the Bobath concept is the lack of a unified framework for both experimental identification and treatment of neurological motor deficits. More conclusive analysis of therapeutic effectiveness requires the development of specific outcomes that measure movement quality.

Enhanced mental image mapping in autism	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Mental rotation; Visual imagery; Discrimination; Perception; Enhanced perceptual functioning model; Autism	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; VISUAL-SEARCH; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; ROTATION; PERCEPTION; INDIVIDUALS; IMITATION; PATTERNS; CHILDREN	The formation and manipulation of mental images represents a key ability for successfully solving visuospatial tasks like Wechsler's Block Design or visual reasoning problems, tasks where autistics perform at higher levels than predicted by their Wechsler IQ. Visual imagery can be used to compare two mental images, allowing judgment of their relative properties. To examine higher visual processes in autism, and their possible role in explaining autistic visuospatial peaks, we carried out two mental imagery experiments in 23 autistic and 14 age and IQ matched, non-autistic adolescents and adults. Among autistics, 11 had significantly higher Block Design scores than predicted by their IQ. Experiment 1 involved imagining a letter inside a circle, followed by a decision concerning which of two highlighted portions of the circle would contain the greater proportion of the letter. Experiment 2 involved four classic mental rotation tasks utilizing two- and three-dimensional geometric figures, hands and letters. Autistics were more accurate in the formation and comparison of mental images than non-autistics. Autistics with a Block Design peak outperformed other participants in both speed and accuracy of mental rotation. Also, Performance IQ and Block Design scores were better predictors of mental rotation accuracy in autistic compared to non-autistic participants. The ability to form, access and manipulate visual mental representations may be more developed in autistics. We propose two complementary mechanisms to explain these processing advantages: (1) a global advantage in perceptual processing, discussed in the framework of the enhanced perceptual functioning model, and (2) particular strengths in veridical mapping, the ability to efficiently detect isomorphisms among entities and then to use these mappings to process stimulus characteristics, thereby facilitating judgments about their differences.

A role for the right superior temporal sulcus in categorical perception of musical chords	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Categorical perception; fMRI; Superior temporal sulcus; Music perception; Hemispheric lateralization; Intraparietal sulcus	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; AUDITORY-CORTEX; SPEECH SOUNDS; DISCRIMINATION; BRAIN; COMPREHENSION; SENSITIVITY; MECHANISMS; INTERVALS; STREAMS	Categorical perception (CP) is a mechanism whereby non-identical stimuli that have the same underlying meaning become invariantly represented in the brain. Through behavioral identification and discrimination tasks, CP has been demonstrated to occur broadly across the auditory modality, including in perception of speech (e.g. phonemes) and music (e.g. chords) stimuli. Several functional imaging studies have linked CP of speech with activity in multiple regions of the left superior temporal sulcus (STS). As language processing is generally left-hemisphere dominant and, conversely, fine-grained spectral processing shows a right hemispheric bias, we hypothesized that CP of musical stimuli would be associated with right STS activity. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test healthy, musically-trained volunteers as they (a) underwent a musical chord adaptation/habituation paradigm and (b) performed an active discrimination task on within- and between-category chord pairs, as well as an acoustically-matched, more continuously-perceived orthogonal sound set. As predicted, greater right STS activity was linked to categorical processing in both experimental paradigms. The results suggest that the left and right STS are functionally specialized and that the right STS may take on a key role in CP of spectrally complex sounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the ubiquity and early emergence of this response, some individuals report being unable to feel the beat in music. We report a sample of people without special training, all of whom were proficient at perceiving and producing the musical beat with the exception of one case ("Mathieu"). Motion capture and psychophysical tests revealed that people synchronized full-body motion to music and detected when a model dancer was not in time with the music. In contrast, Mathieu failed to period- and phase-lock his movement to the beat of most music pieces, and failed to detect most asynchronies of the model dancer. Mathieu's near-normal synchronization with a metronome suggests that the deficit concerns beat finding in the context of music. These results point to time as having a distinct neurobiological origin from pitch in music processing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Following a brief description of Doyon and colleagues' model (2002, 2005, 2009) of motor skill learning that has guided this work, we then describe the functional changes that occur at the different (rapid, slow, automatization) acquisition phases, and propose specific roles that the putamen, the cerebellum and their motor-related cortical areas, play in this form of motor behavior. Finally, we put forward evidence that post-training, non-REM sleep (and spindles in Stage 2 sleep, in particular) contributes to the consolidation of a motor sequence memory trace, and that increased activity within the striatum and/or the hippocampus mediates this mnemonic process.

Signaling cell death from the endoplasmic reticulum stress response	CURRENT OPINION IN CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article							UNFOLDED-PROTEIN RESPONSE; ER STRESS; PROAPOPTOTIC BAX; INDUCED APOPTOSIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; MESSENGER-RNA; ACTIVATION; IRE1; CHOP; KINASE	Inability to meet protein folding demands within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a signaling pathway with both adaptive and apoptotic outputs. While some secretory cell types have a remarkable ability to increase protein folding capacity, their upper limits can be reached when pathological conditions overwhelm the fidelity and/or output of the secretory pathway. Irremediable 'ER stress' induces apoptosis and contributes to cell loss in several common human diseases, including type 2 diabetes and neurodegeneration. Researchers have begun to elucidate the molecular switches that determine when ER stress is too great to repair and the signals that are then sent from the UPR to execute the cell.

A reliable analytical method was developed for the quantification of trace amounts of antidepressants in small tissue homogenate extracts. Levels of six antidepressants and four of their N-desmethyl metabolites were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant amounts of the SSRIs were found in fish tissue-in decreasing order: liver > brain > muscle. Sertraline and its metabolite desmethylsertraline were the predominant substances observed in most tissues (0.04-10.3 ng g(-1)). However, less SSRIs (0.08-1.17 ng g(-1)) were bioaccumulated in the ozonated effluent. The early molecular effects of these SSRIs on the Na/K-dependent ATPase pump activity in brain synaptosomes where also investigated in vitro and in fish exposed to the municipal effluents. With respect to their potential biological effects, in vitro exposure to selected SSRIs induced a reduction of the brain Na/K-ATPase activity in synaptosomes in a dose-dependent manner. Results showed that Na/K-ATPase activity was readily inhibited by exposure to municipal effluent before and, to a lesser extent, after ozone treatment. Moreover, the Na/K-ATPase activity was significantly and negatively correlated with brain tissue concentrations of fluoxetine (r = -0.57; p < 0.03), desmethylsertraline (r = -0.84; p < 0.001), and sertraline (r = -0.82; p < 0.001). The present study reveals that SSRIs are readily available in fish, biologically active and corroborates previous findings on the serotonergic properties of municipal effluents to aquatic organisms.

Several cases have been described in the literature, but the pathophysiological processes vary widely and remain unclear. We describe a 42-year-old male patient with reading epilepsy evaluated using clinical assessments and continuous video/EEG recordings. We administered verbal, nonverbal, and reading tasks to determine factors precipitating seizures. Linguistic characteristics of the words were manipulated. Results indicated that reading-induced seizures were significantly more numerous than those observed during verbal and nonverbal tasks. In reading tasks, spike frequency significantly increased with involvement of the phonological reading route. Spikes were recorded predominantly in left parasagittal regions. Future cerebral imaging studies will enable us to visualize the spatial localization and temporal course of reading-induced seizures and brain activity involved in reading. A better understanding of reading epilepsy is crucial for reading rehabilitation in these patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Context alters the ability of clitoral stimulation to induce a sexually-conditioned partner preference in the rat	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Genitosensory stimulation; Female rat; Sexual reward	FEMALE RATS; PLACE PREFERENCE; VAGINOCERVICAL STIMULATION; SENSORY INNERVATION; NEUROCHEMICAL BASIS; ESTRUS TERMINATION; BILEVEL CHAMBERS; STEROID-HORMONES; ESTROUS FEMALE; BEHAVIOR	We have shown previously that clitoral stimulation (CLS) of female rats induces significant conditioned place preference (CPP), indicating that it is rewarding. The present study asked whether CLS could induce a conditioned partner preference. In the first experiment, sexually naive females received 10 alternating trials of CLS and No-CLS in the presence of a male rat behind a wire-mesh screen. For one group. CLS was made in the presence of the male scented with almond extract. On alternating trials, those females received sham CLS in the presence of an unscented male behind the screen. The order was reversed for the other group. After 5 trials in each condition, females were placed into an open field with two sexually vigorous males, one scented and the other unscented. Contrary to expectation, females displayed a preference for the male associated with sham CLS. The second experiment examined whether a partner preference could be conditioned by associating CLS with the almond odor alone. A new group of sexually naive females received the same CLS-odor, No-CLS-No Odor pairings as above, but with the odor presented on cotton gauze in the chamber. During the final open field test, those females selectively solicited the scented male. We conclude that CLS that induces CPP also induces conditioned partner preference. However, we propose that CLS in the presence of an inaccessible male created a sexual inhibitory state for female rats. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The authors completed a retrospective analysis of 62 term infants with clinical neonatal seizures subsequent to intrapartum asphyxia. Logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the independent prognostic indicators of an adverse outcome. A total of 23 (37%) infants had a normal outcome, 34 (55%) survived with 1 or more neurodevelopmental impairments (23 cerebral palsy, 28 global developmental delay, 15 epilepsy, with 18 combination of two, and 9 all three), and 5 (8%) died. Six variables were associated with an adverse outcome, but only the presence of meconium aspiration, a low (<= 3) 1-minute Apgar score, seizure type other than focal clonic, and moderately severely abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) background findings were independently associated with an adverse outcome. Signs of acute distress are predictors of adverse outcome, alongside seizure semiology and moderate to severe EEG background abnormalities.

Initially, the variation of modal flexibility and load-deflection differential equation of plate in conjunction with the invariant expression for the sum of transverse load are employed to formulate the damage indicator. Then an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques and genetic algorithm are implemented to determine the corresponding damage severity. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to automate the parameter selection process in artificial neural networks and eliminate the context dependent notion of the ANNs. The feasibility of the present Modal Flexibility Variation method (MFV) is verified through some numerical simulation and experimental tests on a steel plate. The results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is quite encouraging and the maximum differences are less than three percent. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we examine the role of beta-catenin in neural stem cell (NSC) regulation in mouse embryos lacking beta-catenin specifically in the brain germinal zone. An in vitro clonal neurosphere assay was performed in order to ascertain the status of the NSC population. Intact neurospheres did not form from beta-catenin-null cells due to a loss of cell adhesion and the number of expanded cells was reduced. Rescue of beta-catenin expression restored adhesion and revealed that the number of NSCs increased in the knockout population. Using a clonal colony-forming assay, which confines precursor cells within a solid collagen matrix, we show that the number of NSCs in the hippocampus is unchanged although the beta-catenin knockout striatum actually contains a larger proportion of NSCs. However, these colonies were smaller than those of control cells, due to increased apoptosis in the progenitor population. Furthermore, beta-catenin knockout NSCs also retained multipotentiality as shown by their ability to clonally differentiate into neurons and glia. The effects on neural precursor cells were not due to loss of downstream T-cell factor signaling, as this pathway is not active in vivo in regions of the embryonic brain where NSCs and progenitor cells reside, nor is it active in vitro in NSC colonies. These data reveal that beta-catenin is not required for the maintenance or differentiation of NSCs, but is required for the adhesion and survival of neural progenitor cells.

These tumours present a challenge because of their risk of malignant transformation and their high probability of operative facial nerve compromise. Design: A description of one case of intraparotid neurofibroma. A systematic MEDLINE review was performed to document all reported cases. Setting: Pediatric tertiary care centre. Methods: An 14-month-old boy was referred with a nontender right-sided 4 x 2.5 cm preauricular mass, which was slowly increasing in size for 8 months. No facial nerve compromise was present. Main Outcome Measures: During superficial parotidectomy, the mass was found to involve the facial nerve and complete resection was performed, on which a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak originating from the stylomastoid foramen occurred. Mastoidectomy revealed an intramastoid division of the facial nerve. The leak coming from the facial nerve was successfully controlled with anastomosis of the major division with the distal nerves. Results: Histopathologic analysis revealed a diffuse neurofibroma. Twenty-two previous cases of intraparotid neurofibroma have been described, although this is the first reported case of the diffuse subtype. Preoperative fine-needle aspiration was inconclusive, and incisional biopsy was dangerous. Conclusion: It seems prudent to delay surgery for asymptomatic pediatric patients with facial neurofibroma. Surgery with primary facial nerve grafting is an effective option for patients with facial function of grade III or worse or when the tumour is large, disfiguring, and aggressive. Potential complications of treatment vary depending on the location of the tumour. These include disease recurrence, facial nerve compromise, and CSF leak.

GIPR expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus (HIP) and neocortex (Cx) of rats undergoing pilocarpine induced status epilepticus (Pilo-SE), and in three young male patients with left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy related to hippocampal sclerosis (MTI.E-HS) treated surgically. A combined Gin immunohistochemistry and Fluoro-Jade staining was carried out to investigate the association between the GIPR expression and neuronal degeneration induced by Pilo-SE. GIPR was expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons from the HIP CA subfields, dentate gyrus (DG) and Cx of animals and human samples. The GIPR expression after the Pilo-SE induction increases significantly in the HIP after 1 h and 5 days, but not after 12 h or 50 days. In the Cx, the GIPR expression increases after 1 h, 12 h and 5 days, but not 50 days after the Pilo-SE. The expression of GIPR 12 h after Pilo-SE was inversely proportional to the Fluoro-Jade staining intensity. In the human tissue, GIPR expression patterns were similar to those observed in chronic Pilo-SE animals. No Fluoro-Jade stained cells were observed in the human sample. GIPR is expressed in human HIP and Cx. There was a time and region dependent increase of GIPR expression in the HIP and Cx after Pilo-SE that was inversely associated to neuronal degeneration.

Developmental Toxicity of Glyceryl Trinitrate in Quail Embryos	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH PART A-CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR TERATOLOGY			English	Article						organic nitrate; quail embryo; microphthalmia; reactive nitrogen species; redox status	EARLY EYE DEVELOPMENT; NEURAL CREST; RAT EMBRYOS; CHICK-EMBRYO; COTURNIX QUAIL; OPTIC VESICLE; TERATOGENICITY; NITRITE; NIRIDAZOLE; MECHANISMS	BACKGROUND: Although glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is used extensively to treat angina and heart failure, little is known about its effects on the conceptus during organogenesis. The goal of these studies was to investigate the effects of GTN in a model organism, the quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) embryo. METHODS: To identify the effects of GTN on quail embryo development, fertilized quail eggs (n = 10-12 eggs/group) were injected with GTN (0, 4.4, 44, or 440 mu M) at Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 0, 9, or 19 and examined 7 days later. Next, HH 9 embryos were injected with GTN (0, 0.88, 4.4, 8.8, 44, 88, and 440 mu M, in 20 mu L per egg) and examined 24-hours, 48-hours, or 72-hours postinjection. Finally, the developing eye on one side was exposed to GTN (44 mu M) ex ovo and the tissue was probed for the presence of nitrated proteins. RESULTS: In ovo GTN exposure induced a dose-dependent increase in the number of malformed viable quail embryos with a maximal effect in HH 9 embryos. Microphthalmia, craniofacial, heart, and neural tube defects were elevated in GTN-exposed embryos. An increase in nitrated proteins was observed in the developing eye region of embryos exposed ex ovo to GTN. CONCLUSIONS: GTN treatment induced a variety of malformations in quail embryos. The presence of nitrated proteins suggests that organic nitrates, such as GTN, generate reactive nitrogen species. We hypothesize that GTN perturbations in the redox status of the embryo may underlie its developmental toxicity. Birth Defects Research (Part A) 91:230-240, 2011.

Recognition of Facial Expressions of Emotions by 3-Year-Olds	EMOTION			English	Article						emotions; development; facial expression recognition (FER); children	AMYGDALA RESPONSE; CHILDRENS IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNIZING EMOTION; NEURAL RESPONSES; SURPRISED FACES; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ADOLESCENTS; PERCEPTION; METAANALYSIS; MODULATION	Very few large-scale studies have focused on emotional facial expression recognition (FER) in 3-year-olds, an age of rapid social and language development. We studied FER in 808 healthy 3-year-olds using verbal and nonverbal computerized tasks for four basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, and fear). Three-year-olds showed differential performance on the verbal and nonverbal FER tasks, especially with respect to fear. That is to say, fear was one of the most accurately recognized facial expressions as matched nonverbally and the least accurately recognized facial expression as labeled verbally. Sex did not influence emotion-matching nor emotion-labeling performance after adjusting for basic matching or labeling ability. Three-year-olds made systematic errors in emotion-labeling. Namely, happy expressions wen:. often confused with fearful expressions, whereas negative expressions were often confused with other negative expressions. Together, these findings suggest that 3-year-olds' FER skills strongly depend on task specifications. Importantly, fear was the most sensitive facial expression in this regard. Finally, in line with previous studies, we found that recognized emotion categories are initially broad, including emotions of the same valence, as reflected in the nonrandom errors of 3-year-olds.

HEPATOLOGY			English	Review							ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; IBUPROFEN RESTORES; MILD HYPOTHERMIA; BRAIN EDEMA; IN-VIVO; RATS; INFLAMMATION; CONTRIBUTES	Encephalopathy and brain edema are serious central nervous system complications of liver failure. Recent studies using molecular probes and antibodies to cell-specific marker proteins have demonstrated the activation of microglial cells in the brain during liver failure and confirmed a central neuroinflammatory response. In animal models of ischemic or toxic liver injury, microglial activation and concomitantly increased expression of genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines in the brain occur early in the progression of encephalopathy and brain edema. Moreover, the prevention of these complications with mild hypothermia or N-acetylcysteine (two treatments known to manifest both peripheral and central cytoprotective properties) averts central neuroinflammation due to liver failure. Recent studies using anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen and indomethacin have shown promise for the treatment of mild encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis, whereas treatment with minocycline, a potent inhibitor of microglial activation, attenuates the encephalopathy grade and prevents brain edema in experimental acute liver failure. The precise nature of the signaling mechanisms between the failing liver and central neuroinflammation has yet to be fully elucidated; mechanisms involving blood-brain cytokine transfer and receptor-mediated cytokine signal transduction as well as a role for liver-related toxic metabolites such as ammonia have been proposed. The prevention of central proinflammatory processes will undoubtedly herald a new chapter in the development of agents for the prevention and treatment of the central nervous system complications of liver failure.

Nonsynaptic plateau potentials induced by acetylcholine account for persistent firing in many cortical and subcortical structures. The expression of these intrinsic properties in cortical neurons involves the recruitment of a non-selective cation conductance. Despite its functional importance, the identity of the cation channels remains unknown. Here we show that, in layer V of rat medial entorhinal cortex, muscarinic receptor-evoked plateau potentials and persistent firing induced by carbachol require phospholipase C activation, decrease of PIP(2) levels, and permissive intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. Plateau potentials and persistent activity were suppressed by the generic nonselective cation channel blockers FFA (100 mu M) and 2-APB (100 mu M), as well as by the TRPC channel blocker SKF-96365 (50 mu M). However, plateau potentials were not affected by the TRPV channel blocker ruthenium red (40 mu M). The TRPC3/6/7 activator OAG did not induce or enhance persistent firing evoked by carbachol. Voltage clamp recordings revealed a carbachol-activated, nonselective cationic current with a heteromeric TRPC-like phenotype. Moreover, plateau potentials and persistent firing were inhibited by intracellular application of the peptide EQVTTRL that disrupts interactions between the C-terminal domain of TRPC4/5 subunits and associated PDZ proteins. Altogether, our data suggest that TRPC cation channels mediating persistent muscarinic currents significantly contribute to the firing and mnemonic properties of projection neurons in the entorhinal cortex.

Characterization of the performance losses due to environmental factors could provide useful information for the future development of NIRS-based brain-computer interfaces that can be taken beyond controlled laboratory settings and into everyday environments. Experiments with a hidden Markov model-based classifier showed that while significant performance could be attained in silent conditions, only chance levels of sensitivity and specificity were obtained in noisy environments. In order to achieve robustness against environment noise, two strategies were proposed and evaluated. First, physiological responses harnessed from the autonomic nervous system were used as complementary information to NIRS signals. More specifically, four physiological signals (electrodermal activity, skin temperature, blood volume pulse, and respiration effort) were collected in synchrony with the NIRS signals as the user sat at rest and/or performed music imagery tasks. Second, an acoustic monitoring technique was proposed and used to detect startle noise events, as both the prefrontal cortex and ANS are known to involuntarily respond to auditory startle stimuli. Experiments with eight participants showed that with a startle noise compensation strategy in place, performance comparable to that observed in silent conditions could be recovered with the hybrid ANS-NIRS system.

VgN-induced sinus cycle length prolongation was potentiated during SCS among the animals with intact neural connections or bilateral vagotomy proximal to the stimulation site, whereas such prolongation was unaffected by SCS among animals with bilateral decentralization of stellate ganglia. Likewise, the atrial surface area in which VgN-induced repolarization wave form changes were identified was significantly augmented during SCS among the former but not among the latter. AT facilitation occurred during SCS in the majority of animals with intact neural connections, particularly among those displaying relatively greater potentiation of vagally mediated sinus cycle length prolongation. Conclusion: The data indicate that SCS may cause potentiation of parasympathetic influences on the atria in response to cervical VgN stimulation. Such SCS effects appear to be mediated via decreased tonic inhibitory sympathetic influences in the presence of intact stellate ganglion connections to central neurons.

Information transmission and detection thresholds in the vestibular nuclei: single neurons vs. population encoding. J Neurophysiol 105: 1798-1814, 2011. First published February 9, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00910.2010.-Understanding how sensory neurons transmit information about relevant stimuli remains a major goal in neuroscience. Of particular relevance are the roles of neural variability and spike timing in neural coding. Peripheral vestibular afferents display differential variability that is correlated with the importance of spike timing; regular afferents display little variability and use a timing code to transmit information about sensory input. Irregular afferents, conversely, display greater variability and instead use a rate code. We studied how central neurons within the vestibular nuclei integrate information from both afferent classes by recording from a group of neurons termed vestibular only (VO) that are known to make contributions to vestibulospinal reflexes and project to higher-order centers. We found that, although individual central neurons had sensitivities that were greater than or equal to those of individual afferents, they transmitted less information. In addition, their velocity detection thresholds were significantly greater than those of individual afferents. This is because VO neurons display greater variability, which is detrimental to information transmission and signal detection. Combining activities from multiple VO neurons increased information transmission. However, the information rates were still much lower than those of equivalent afferent populations. Furthermore, combining responses from multiple VO neurons led to lower velocity detection threshold values approaching those measured from behavior (degrees 2.5 vs. 0.5-1 degrees/s). Our results suggest that the detailed time course of vestibular stimuli encoded by afferents is not transmitted by VO neurons. Instead, they suggest that higher vestibular pathways must integrate information from central vestibular neuron populations to give rise to behaviorally observed detection thresholds.

Articulatory and acoustic adaptation to palatal perturbation	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							SPEECH PRODUCTION; SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; ARTIFICIAL PALATE; NEURAL PLASTICITY; PERCEPTUAL DATA; REHABILITATION; COMPENSATION; PRINCIPLES; RESPONSES; SYSTEM	Previous work has established that speakers have difficulty making rapid compensatory adjustments in consonant production (especially in fricatives) for structural perturbations of the vocal tract induced by artificial palates with thicker-than-normal alveolar regions. The present study used electromagnetic articulography and simultaneous acoustic recordings to estimate tongue configurations during production of [s (sic) t k] in the presence of a thin and a thick palate, before and after a practice period. Ten native speakers of English participated in the study. In keeping with previous acoustic studies, fricatives were more affected by the palate than were the stops. The thick palate lowered the center of gravity and the jaw was lower and the tongue moved further backwards and downwards. Center of gravity measures revealed complete adaptation after training, and with practice, subjects' decreased interlabial distance. The fact that adaptation effects were found for [k], which are produced with an articulatory gesture not directly impeded by the palatal perturbation, suggests a more global sensorimotor recalibration that extends beyond the specific articulatory target.

Loss of the glutamate transporter splice-variant GLT-1b in inferior colliculus and its prevention by ceftriaxone in thiamine deficiency	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Vitamin B1; Excitotoxicity; Wernicke encephalopathy; Inferior colliculus; Astrocyte; Glutamate transporter	AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTER; RAT-BRAIN; EXTRACELLULAR GLUTAMATE; CULTURED ASTROCYTES; DOWN-REGULATION; IN-VITRO; EXPRESSION; INDUCTION; CLONING; NEUROPROTECTION	Downregulation of astrocytic glutamate transporters is a feature of thiamine deficiency (TD), the underlying cause of Wernicke's encephalopathy, and plays a major role in its pathophysiology. Recent investigations suggest that ceftriaxone, a beta-lactam antibiotic, stimulates GLT-1 expression and confers neuroprotection against ischemic and motor neuron degeneration. Thus, ceftriaxone treatment may be a protective strategy against excitotoxic conditions. In the present study, we examined the effects of ceftriaxone on the glutamate transporter splice-variant GLT-lb in rats with TD and in cultured astrocytes under TD conditions. Our results indicate that ceftriaxone protects against loss of GLT-lb levels in the inferior colliculus during TD, but with no significant effect in the thalamus and frontal cortex by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Ceftriaxone also normalized the loss of GLT-1b in astrocyte cultures under conditions of TD. These results suggest that ceftriaxone has the ability to increase CLT-1b levels in astrocytes during TD, and may be an important pharmacological strategy for the treatment of excitotoxicity in this disorder.

However, there are no large pediatric case series. We, therefore, wanted to review the clinical features of NHs in our population. Methods: Hospital records of 31 patients with pathology or imaging-confirmed NHs were reviewed. Two-sided Fisher's exact t-test was used to assess associations between distribution of NHs and specific clinical features. Key Findings: NHs were distributed as follows: 8 (26%) unilateral focal subependymal, 3 (10%) unilateral diffuse subependymal, 5 (16%) bilateral focal subependymal, 12 (39%) bilateral diffuse subependymal, and 3 (10%) isolated subcortical. The phenotypic spectrum in our population differs from that described in adults. Significant morbidity and mortality are associated with presentation in childhood. Twenty-two of 31 patients (71%) died in the neonatal period or in childhood. Additional cerebral malformations were found in 80% and systemic malformations in 74%. The majority of patients had developmental delay, intellectual deficit, and intractable epilepsy. Patients with unilateral focal NHs were more likely to have ventriculomegaly (p = 0.027), and those with bilateral diffuse NHs more likely to have cerebellar abnormalities (p = 0.007). Isolated subcortical NHs were associated with multiple malformations (p = 0.049) and cardiac abnormalities (p = 0.027). Underlying etiology was heterogeneous and determined in only six cases (19%): del chr 1p36, del chr 15q11, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, sialic acidosis type 1, Aicardi syndrome, and FLNA mutation. Significance: NHs are present in childhood as part of multiple cerebral and systemic malformations; developmental delay and refractory seizures are the rule rather than the exception. Milder forms go unrecognized until seizure onset in adulthood.

Still, little is known about the long-term and cumulative effects of concussions on brain neurophysiology. The principal objective of this study was to investigate the long-lasting effects of multiple sports concussions on sensorimotor integration and somatosensory processing in a sample of 12 concussed athletes and 14 non-concussed athletes of similar age (mean, 23 years) and education (mean, 16 years). Right median nerve stimulation was paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left primary motor cortex to investigate sensorimotor integration with short latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and long latency afferent inhibition (LAI) at five interstimulus intervals (18, 20, 22, 100, 200 msec). Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were recorded from the left centro-parietal region. We also investigated primary motor cortex inhibitory mechanisms with three TMS protocols: cortical silent period, long interval intracortical inhibition, and short interval intracortical inhibition. Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. No differences were observed between groups for SAI, LAI, and SEP. However, cortical silent period duration was prolonged and long interval intracortical inhibition was enhanced in the concussed group. These findings suggest that multiple sports concussions lead to specific, long-term neurophysiological dysfunctions of intracortical inhibitory mechanisms in primary motor cortex while somatosensory processing and sensorimotor integration are spared. This study provides additional evidence for the presence of specific and stable alterations of GABA(B) receptor activity in primary motor cortex that may be of clinical value for prognosis and diagnosis.

This construct is associated with the assumption that mental processes can be reduced to activity at a neuronal level. The approach has had a strong influence on the conceptual basis of proposals for DSM-5, but could be consistent either with categorical or dimensional diagnosis. However, application of endophenotypes to personality disorders is unlikely for the foreseeable future, given an insufficient knowledge of etiology and pathogenesis.

Seizure onset in bMTLE tends to be in adolescence or adulthood, and patients frequently have a family history of febrile seizures and epilepsy. Long-term seizure freedom is observed with or without antiepileptic medication. On brain MRI, nearly 40% of patients with long-standing bMTLE show evidence of hippocampal sclerosis, a feature usually associated with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. Prospective studies are needed to determine the features that allow prediction of a benign course, and to clarify the significance of hippocampal MRI changes.

In children with PACNS, small-vessel (SV) involvement is characterized clinically by progressive neurologic symptoms, multifocal lesions on brain imaging, occasional pseudo-tumor presentation, and normal angiogram results in most patients. Small case series of patients with SV PACNS with short follow-up usually reveal favorable outcomes in children treated with immunosuppressive therapy. We report here the cases of 3 children with biopsy-confirmed SV PACNS and long-term follow-up who developed different patterns of neurologic deterioration despite immunosuppressive therapy. One patient had transient ischemic attacks shortly after initiation of corticosteroid treatment. Early ischemic events probably result from residual thrombogenicity or residual inflammation of recently affected vessels, which supports the use of antiplatelet agents and suggests potential benefits of stronger immunosuppressive therapy. In contrast, the other 2 patients had later neurologic deterioration after corticosteroid withdrawal, which suggests failure of initial immunosuppressant treatment and the need for stronger agents, longer treatment duration, or both. All patients responded to long-term treatment with corticosteroids combined with cytotoxic agents. This particular combination is probably indicated in many cases of SV PACNS, including those with neurologic deterioration that occurs during maintenance corticotherapy or after corticosteroid withdrawal. In 1 case, SV PACNS recurred several years after discontinuation of combination therapy. Long-term relapses may reflect intrinsic predispositions to SV PACNS rather than treatment failure. These cases highlight different chronological patterns of neurologic deterioration despite immunosuppressive therapy, which supports the relevance of monitoring clinical, laboratory, and radiologic responses to treatment and of long-term follow-up of patients with SV PACNS.

Activity in this circuit may be modulated by internal factors, such as hunger, and cognitive factors. Anticipation to eat is one such factor, which likely impacts consummatory behavior. Here, the neural substrates of food expectancy were identified in 10 healthy male participants who underwent two whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans on separate days. Fasted subjects viewed images of food and scenery, in two counterbalanced states. During one condition, subjects were 'expecting' to eat right after the scan and during the other they were 'not expecting' to eat for 1 h after the scan. Food pictures compared with scenery yielded bilateral activation in visual areas as well as in the left insula and amygdala in both conditions. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and putamen were additionally activated in the 'not expecting' condition while right orbitofrontal cortex activity was enhanced in the 'expecting' condition. These data suggest that cognitive manipulations affect the response to food cues in the prefrontal cortex, in areas involved in the planning and control of motivated behaviors, while the amygdala and insula responded equally in both conditions, consistent with a more basic role in homeostatically driven appetitive behavior.

Circadian Clock Gene Expression in Brain Regions of Alzheimer's Disease Patients and Control Subjects	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS			English	Article						circadian clock gene; human; pineal gland; cingulate cortex; bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST); Alzheimer's disease	BLOOD MONONUCLEAR-CELLS; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; PERIPHERAL-TISSUES; SENILE-DEMENTIA; MESSENGER-RNA; RHYTHMS; SLEEP; PATTERNS; BMAL1; MOUSE	Circadian oscillators have been observed throughout the rodent brain. In the human brain, rhythmic expression of clock genes has been reported only in the pineal gland, and little is known about their expression in other regions. The investigators sought to determine whether clock gene expression could be detected and whether it varies as a function of time of day in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and cingulate cortex, areas known to be involved in decision making and motivated behaviors, as well as in the pineal gland, in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and aged controls. Relative expression levels of PERIOD1 (PER1), PERIOD2 (PER2), and Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) were detected by quantitative PCR in all 3 brain regions. A harmonic regression model revealed significant 24-h rhythms of PER1 in the BNST of AD subjects. A significant rhythm of PER2 was found in the cingulate cortex and BNST of control subjects and in all 3 regions of AD patients. In controls, BMAL1 did not show a diurnal rhythm in the cingulate cortex but significantly varied with time of death in the pineal and BNST and in all 3 regions for AD patients. Notable differences in the phase of clock gene rhythms and phase relationships between genes and regions were observed in the brains of AD compared to those of controls. These results indicate the presence of multiple circadian oscillators in the human brain and suggest altered synchronization among these oscillators in the brain of AD patients.

Interferon beta-1b and glatiramer acetate effects on permanent black hole evolution	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							RELAPSING MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; T1-WEIGHTED SPIN-ECHO; HYPOINTENSE LESIONS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; DISEASE-ACTIVITY; MRI; EFFICACY; TRIALS; CELLS; MS	Objective: To compare interferon beta-1b (IFN beta-1b) and glatiramer acetate (GA) on new lesion (NL) (gadolinium-enhancing, new T2) evolution into permanent black holes (PBH)-a marker of irreversible tissue damage-in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods: BEYOND was a large, phase III, clinical trial comparing IFN beta-1b 250 mu g, IFN beta-1b 500 mu g, and GA (2: 2: 1). Patient scans were reexamined post hoc for PBH in a rater-blinded manner. Two predefined coprimary endpoints compared IFN beta-1b 250 mu g with GA: first, number of PBH per patient at year 2 evolving from year 1 NL, then proportion of year 1 NL evolving into PBH at year 2. IFN beta-1b 500 mu g and GA were compared in an exploratory fashion. Results: Approximately 90% (1,957/2,244) of patients had NL at year 1 with follow-up at year 2. Mean numbers of PBH per patient at year 2 evolving from year 1 NL were lower for IFN beta-1b 250 mu g than GA (0.30 vs 0.43; p = 0.0451). The proportion of NL evolving into PBH was similar (IFN beta-1b 250 mu g vs GA: 21.6% vs 23.5%; p > 0.20). For IFN beta-1b 500 mu g, both the mean PBH number per patient at year 2 evolving from year 1 NL (0.26 vs 0.43; p = 0.0037) and proportion of NL evolving into PBH (16.3% vs 23.5%; p = 0.0409) were lower relative to GA. Conclusion: IFN beta-1b affected PBH development to a similar or better extent than GA. IFN beta-1b favorably influences an MRI outcome indicative of permanent tissue destruction in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that IFN beta-1b is associated with a reduction in MRI PBH formation and evolution compared with GA between years 1 and 2 of treatment.

Outcome of severe arteriovenous malformation-related intracranial hemorrhage: the importance of cisternal subarachnoid hemorrhage and early seizures	ACTA NEUROCHIRURGICA			English	Article						Arteriovenous malformation; Intracranial hemorrhage; Outcome; Seizure; Subarachnoid hemorrhage	INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; BRAIN; MANAGEMENT; EMBOLIZATION	Although arteriovenous malformations (AVM)-related intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is infrequently devastating, there is a subgroup of patients that present comatose requiring immediate surgical treatment. We sought to determine the outcome and prognostic factors in those patients with severe AVM-ICH. Between 2003 and 2009, medical records of 16 consecutive patients presented with severe AVM-ICH were retrospectively reviewed. Outcome was determined using 30-day survival and Glasgow outcome scale and modified Rankin scale scores at last follow-up. There were seven males and nine females with a mean age of 32 years (range 6-66). All had Glasgow coma score 8 or less and most exhibited motor posturing and/or dilated pupils. Fifteen patients had intraprenchymal, ten had intraventricular, and four had subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Twelve patients underwent hematoma evacuation with concomitant decompressive craniectomy in 11 and external ventricular drainage (EVD) in six. EVD was the only treatment offered to four patients. AVM excision was not routinely attempted in the acute phase. Three patients died from extensive bihemispheric infarction and refractory intracranial pressure. All 13 survivors improved neurologically and 12 had an acceptable functional outcome (modified Rankin scale a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 4) after a mean follow-up of 10 months (range 1-49). Among all clinical, radiological, and operative variables, only cisternal SAH (P = 0.007) and early seizures (P = 0.018) were significantly associated with death. Despite their poor initial clinical condition, most survivors of severe AVM-ICH achieve an acceptable functional outcome. Therefore, patients with severe AVM-ICH, particularly those without aneurysmal-like SAH, should be managed aggressively given their remarkable potential for neurological recovery.

Critical involvement of the thalamus and precuneus during restoration of consciousness with physostigmine in humans during propofol anaesthesia: a positron emission tomography study	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						brain imaging; cerebral blood flow; cerebral cortex; consciousness; general anaesthetics; thalamus	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; INDUCED UNCONSCIOUSNESS; HUMAN VOLUNTEERS; HUMAN BRAIN; SEVOFLURANE; PET; STIMULATION; METABOLISM; MIDAZOLAM; REGIONS	Background. Functional brain imaging offers a way to investigate how general anaesthetics impair consciousness. However, functional imaging changes may result from drug effects unrelated to hypnosis. Establishing a causal link with loss of consciousness is thus difficult. Methods. To identify changes of neuronal activity functionally linked to the level of consciousness, physostigmine was used to restore consciousness without changing the anaesthetic concentration in 11 subjects anaesthetized with propofol. Eight subjects (responders) regained consciousness after physostigmine and three did not (non-responders). Positron emission tomography was used to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF); during baseline (awake), after anaesthesia-induced loss of consciousness, after physostigmine administration, and recovery. In addition to subtraction analyses, we used conjunction analysis in the responders to identify changes common to the baseline-anaesthesia and physostigmine-anaesthesia contrasts. Results. Complete data were available for seven subjects (four responders and three non-responders). The analyses revealed that unconsciousness was associated with rCBF decreases in the thalamus and precuneus. Restoration of consciousness by physostigmine was associated with rCBF increases in these same structures, with the strongest effect in the thalamus. Conclusions. The results provide strong evidence that reductions in rCBF in the thalamus and precuneus are functionally related to propofol-induced unconsciousness independently of any non-specific effects of propofol. These observations confirm that the thalamus and precuneus are key elements to understand how general anaesthetics cause unconsciousness and how patients wake up from anaesthesia. Furthermore, they are consistent with the notion that anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness is associated with reduced cholinergic activation.	[Xie, G.; Deschamps, A.; Backman, S.

Lidocaine has been associated with a high incidence of transient neurological symptoms, and bupivacaine produces sensory and motor blocks of long duration. Preservative-free 2-chloroprocaine (2-CP) seems to be a promising alternative, being a short-acting agent of increasing popularity in recent years. This study was designed to compare 2-CP with bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia in an elective ambulatory setting. A total of 106 patients were enrolled in this randomized double-blind study. Spinal anesthesia was achieved with 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine 7.5 mg (n = 53) or 2% preservative-free 2-CP 40 mg (n = 53). The primary endpoint for the study was the time until reaching eligibility for discharge. Secondary outcomes included the duration of the sensory and motor blocks, the length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit, the time until ambulation, and the time until micturition. The average time to discharge readiness was 277 min in the 2-CP group and 353 min in the bupivacaine group, a difference of 76 min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 40 to 112 min; P < 0.001). The average time for complete regression of the sensory block was 146 min in the 2-CP group and 329 min in the bupivacaine group, a difference of 185 min (95% CI: 159 to 212 min; P < 0.001). Times to ambulation and micturition were also significantly lower in the 2-CP group. Spinal 2-chloroprocaine provides adequate duration and depth of surgical anesthesia for short procedures with the advantages of faster block resolution and earlier hospital discharge compared with spinal bupivacaine.

This study examined the neuronal changes that could underlie this behavioral observation. Single neurons were recorded in the frontal eye field (FEF) of 2 monkeys as they executed a visually guided saccade task, while holding their hand at given locations on a touch screen. The task was performed with the hand either visible or invisible, in order to assess the relative contribution of visual and proprioceptive information on hand position. Among the 224 neurons tested, the visual, saccadic and/or preparatory activity of more than half of them was modulated by hand position, whether the hand was visible or invisible. Comparison of lower (hand's workspace) and upper (out of reach) visual targets showed that hand modulation was predominant in the hand's workspace. Finally, some cells preferred congruency of hand and target in space, others preferred incongruency. Interestingly, hand modulation of saccadic activity correlated with hand position effects on saccade reaction times. We conclude that visual and proprioceptive signals derived from the hand are integrated by FEF neurons. These signals can modulate target selection through attention and allow the oculomotor system to use hand-related somatosensory signals for the initiation of visually guided saccades.

Despite the important role of this enzyme in peptide synthesis, how PC1/3 activity is regulated is still poorly understood. Using ion exchange chromatography and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis we found that natural PC1/3 present in AtT-20 cells and bovine chromaffin granules, as well as recombinant PC1/3 secreted from overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, exists as multiple ionic forms. Gel filtration and cross-linking studies revealed that protein oligomerization and aggregation contribute greatly to variability in surface charge. The mostacidic forms of PC1/3 contained both inactive aggregates as well as oligomerized 87-kDa PC1/3 that exhibited stable activity which was partially latent and could be revealed by dilution. No such latency was observed for the more basic, 66/74-kDa forms of PC1/3. Fractions containing these species were stabilized by preincubation with micromolar concentrations of either fluorogenic substrate or peptides containing pairs of basic residues. In addition, the most active form of 87-kDa PC1/3, a probable homodimer, was activated by preincubation with these same peptides. Cleavage by PC1/3 is often the initiating step in the biosynthetic pathway for peptide hormones, implying that this is a natural step for regulation. Our data suggest that enzyme oligomerization and peptide stabilization represent important contributing factors for the control of PC1/3 activity within secretory granules.

Changes in the referent body location and configuration may underlie human gait, as confirmed by findings of multi-muscle activity minimizations and phase resetting	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Locomotion; Feed-forward control; Posture and gait; Multi-muscle coordination; Redundancy problems; Equilibrium-point-hypothesis; Spatial frames of reference	EQUILIBRIUM-POINT HYPOTHESIS; DIFFERENT DESCENDING SYSTEMS; FICTIVE LOCOMOTOR CYCLE; PATTERN GENERATION; HUMAN WALKING; MOTOR CONTROL; RHYTHMICAL MOVEMENTS; BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS; MUSCLE COORDINATION; POSTURAL STABILITY	Locomotion is presumably guided by feed-forward shifts in the referent body location in the desired direction in the environment. We propose that the difference between the actual and the referent body locations is transmitted to neurons that virtually diminish this difference by appropriately changing the referent body configuration, i.e. the body posture at which muscles reach their recruitment thresholds. Muscles are activated depending on the gap between the actual and the referent body configurations resulting in a step being made to minimize this gap. This hypothesis implies that the actual and the referent leg configurations can match each other at certain phases of the gait cycle, resulting in minimization of leg muscle activity. We found several leg configurations at which EMG minima occurred, both during forward and backward gait. It was also found that the set of limb configurations associated with EMG minima can be changed by modifying the pattern of forward and backward gait. Our hypothesis predicts that, in response to perturbations of gait, the rate of shifts in the referent body location can temporarily be changed to avoid falling. The rate influences the phase of rhythmic limb movements during gait. Therefore, following the change in the rate of the referent body location, the whole gait pattern, for all four limbs, will irreversibly be shifted in time (long-lasting and global phase resetting) with only transient changes in the gait speed, swing and stance timing and cycle duration. Aside from transient changes in the duration of the swing and/or stance phase in response to perturbation, few previous studies have documented long-lasting and global phase resetting of human gait in response to perturbation. Such resetting was a robust finding in our study. By confirming the notion that feed-forward changes in the referent body location and configuration underlie human locomotion, this study solves the classical problem in the relationship between stability of posture and gait and advances the understanding of how human locomotion involves the whole body and is accomplished in a spatial frame of reference associated with the environment.

However, GC secretion in response to immune activation and other stressors is attenuated at term of pregnancy. GCs are important modulators of the immune response, and both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects are described. Here, we examined whether GC secretion in response to LPS is maintained in earlier pregnancy before term, and investigated the role of endogenous GCs in modulating LPS-induced circulating cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), in pregnant compared to non-pregnant female rats. Plasma corticosterone (Cort) and ACTH responses to LPS were well maintained in pregnant rats at embryonic days 15/16 (E15/16) and E18/19 compared to non-pregnant rats. At E19, maternal LPS administration increased fetal plasma Cort and decreased testosterone in male fetuses. In non-pregnant animals, pretreatment with the GC synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone, inhibited the LPS-induced increase in IL-6, and the IL-6 response was restored by Cort replacement, indicating that LPS induction of IL-6 is Cort-dependent. In E15 pregnant animals, metyrapone had no effect on LPS-induced IL-6 levels, indicating that LPS-induction of IL-6 is not dependent on Cort. These contrasting patterns of IL-6 induction in nonpregnant and pregnant animals were reflected in levels of hypothalamic Socs3 mRNA, an indicator of IL-6 signaling pathway activation. In both non-pregnant and pregnant rats, LPS-induced plasma TNF-alpha responses were inhibited by metyrapone but not re-instated by Cort replacement. It is suggested that altered GC regulation of IL-6 may be required to sustain specialized functions of IL-6 during pregnancy.

Method: This is a retrospective cohort study. The predictive testing protocol consisted of a telephone interview to give information about predictive testing and collect demographic data; a psychological assessment and counseling session; a session focused on medical and family history of HD; a session reserved for genetic counseling; a session where results were given to participants; and a follow-up telephone interview. Results: A total of 181 applicants requested presymptomatic testing. 135 applicants (77 women and 58 men) completed the protocol and received test results while 40 withdrew. Of the latter, 3 manifested symptoms of the disease and were referred to a neurologist or psychiatrist, and 3 had previously been tested by linkage analysis. Participants usually mentioned more than one reason for requesting predictive testing but the most frequent was to put an end to uncertainty concerning their risk of illness. The proportion of positive and negatives test results was 40% and 54.1% respectively, significantly different from the expected 50% (p<0.01). Prenatal testing was not frequently requested. Conclusion: All the participants expressed satisfaction regarding their decision to be tested. None to our knowledge had a catastrophic reaction (major depressive disorder or psychiatric hospitalization, declared suicide attempt or suicide). Our study highlights that preparation for receiving test results is a psychologically complex process for which appropriate support in a timely fashion is critical. We feel that a cautious and ethical case by case approach remains essential and that high standards of testing should be maintained because of the far reaching impact of test results.

We sought to determine whether continuous electroencephalography (CEEG) aids the prediction of the clinical course and response to treatment of DCI. Patients deemed high-risk for DCI based on the modified Fisher scale were prospectively monitored. A novel CEEG parameter measuring relative alpha power and variability in the anterior brain quadrants termed composite alpha index (CAI) was graphically displayed. Predictions of the status of patients for the ensuing day were made by an independent reviewer, first using clinical data then repeated following the addition of CAI trends. These were compared to the actual clinical state. The reviewer was blinded to the presence and treatment of DCI. Patients with DCI were further studied by trending the daily mean alpha power against the modulation of treatment and clinical evolution. Fifty-nine predictions were made in 12 patients (mean age 54.3 years, range 35-70; nine females) with Hunt-Hess grades ranging I-V. Sensitivity of predicting clinical deterioration with CEEG improved from 40 to 67% and clinical improvement from 8 to 50%. In three patients, CEEG was predictive greater than 24 h prior to clinical change. Tracking the daily mean alpha power accurately identified DCI recurrence and poor responders to first-line therapy at pre-clinical stages. CEEG is a useful non-invasive tool to supplement routine clinical parameters in the prediction of DCI. It can dynamically monitor the response to treatment and might aid pre-clinical management decisions.

Neuropathic pain- and glial derived neurotrophic factor-associated regulation of cadherins in spinal circuits of the dorsal horn	PAIN			English	Article						N-cadherin; E-cadherin; Spinal nerve ligation; Rat; Synaptic plasticity; Nerve regeneration	PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; KINASE-C-GAMMA; ROOT GANGLION-CELLS; ACTIVATING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-3; PRIMARY SENSORY AFFERENTS; RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE; N-CADHERIN; CORD-INJURY; ADHESION MOLECULE; TACTILE ALLODYNIA	Neuropathic pain is associated with reorganization of spinal synaptic circuits, implying that adhesion proteins that normally build and modify synapses must be involved. The adhesion proteins E-and N-cadherin delineate different synapses furnished by nociceptive primary afferents, but dynamic aspects of cadherin localization in relationship to onset, maintenance or reversibility of neuropathic pain are uncharacterized. Here, we find very different responses of these cadherins to L5 spinal nerve transection (SNT)-induced mechanical allodynia and to intrathecal glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which has potent analgesic effects in this pain model. In L5, E-cadherin is rapidly eliminated in patches within lamina IIi contemporaneously with the onset of mechanical allodynia. Intrathecal GDNF in conjunction with, or at 7 days after, L5 SNT prevents or reverses both the loss of E-cadherin and abnormal pain sensation. In contrast, N-cadherin undergoes a delayed and transient increase uniformly across lamina I-II that is insensitive to GDNF. Some N-cadherin-labeled profiles codistribute with GAP-43, suggesting a role in axon sprouting. Patterns of immunolabeling for GDNF receptor components GFR alpha 1, NCAM, and RET after L5 SNT suggest that GFRa1 and NCAM are the principal receptors operative in this model. In addition, GFRa1 codistributes with E-cadherin, but not N-cadherin, profiles. Together, these data indicate strikingly divergent patterns of temporal and molecular regulation of different cadherins at distinct nociceptive circuits in response to spinal nerve injury, suggesting that the two cadherins and the circuits with which they are affiliated participate in different aspects of synaptic and circuit reorganization associated with neuropathic pain.

The Quality of Life of Young Children and Infants with Chronic Medical Problems: Review of the Literature	CURRENT PROBLEMS IN PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH CARE			English	Article							LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; LEFT-HEART SYNDROME; NEONATAL INTENSIVE-CARE; AGE 8 YEARS; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; PREMATURE-INFANTS; HEALTH-STATUS; SPINA-BIFIDA; DOWN-SYNDROME; ADULTS BORN	The question "what makes a good quality of life?" is a philosophical one which could be thought immune to scientific investigations. However, over the last few decades there has been great progress in developing tools to quantify quality of life (QoL) to make comparisons between different health states, evaluate the effectiveness of medical interventions, and describe the life trajectories of individuals or groups. Using a series of vignettes, we explore and review the biomedical literature to demonstrate how QoL is affected by chronic health conditions in childhood, and how it evolves as individuals pass into adulthood. Individuals experiencing serious chronic illnesses generally have reduced health-related QoL: their health status has significant repercussions of their everyday life, but scores are usually much better than healthy individuals expect, and better than physicians predict. Global QoL is more than a health status concept. QoL is a complex relationship between objectivity and subjectivity; it requires substantial and valid facts, and it defines itself by an interpretation of health within different schemes of values: societal, medical, and those of the subject themselves. QoL is dynamic; purely physical influences diminish as individuals age, and psychosocial factors become much more important. Resilience frequently allows adaptation to adverse health states, leading to acceptable QoL for most children with disabilities.

Two previously described alleles, Lp and Lp(m1Jus), segregate in a semi-dominant fashion, with heterozygotes displaying the looped-tail appearance, while homozygotes show the neural tube defect called craniorachischisis. Here, we report a novel experimentally induced allele, Lp(m2Jus), that carries a missense mutation, R259L, in Vangl2. This mutation was specific to the Lp phenotype and absent from both parental strains and 28 other inbred strains. Notably, this mutation segregates in a recessive manner with all heterozygotes appearing normal and 47% of homozygotes showing a looped-tail. Homozygous Lp(m2Jus) embryos showed spina bifida in 12%. Lp(m2Jus) genetically interacts with Lp with 77% of compound heterozygotes displaying craniorachischisis. Vangl2(R259L) behaved like the wild-type allele in overexpression and morpholino knockdown/rescue assays in zebrafish embryos. These data suggest that Lp(m2Jus) represents a new hypomorphic allele of Lp. Developmental Dynamics 240:839-849, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Hippocampus, amygdala and global brain changes 10 years after childhood traumatic brain injury	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain injury; MRI; Hippocampus; Amygdala; Morphometry; Children	CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; DIFFUSION-TENSOR; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; LONGITUDINAL CHANGES; MAJOR DEPRESSION; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; MEMORY FUNCTION; CHILDREN; ATROPHY; MRI	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children results in damage to the developing brain, particularly in severely injured individuals. Little is known, however, of the long-term structural aspects of the brain following childhood TBI. This study investigated the integrity of the brain 10 years post-TBI using magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics in a sample of 49 participants with mild, moderate and severe TB!, evaluated against a normative sample of 20 individuals from a pediatric database with comparable age and gender distribution. Structural integrity was investigated in gray and white matter, and by manually segmenting two regions of interest (hippocampus, amygdala), potentially vulnerable to the effects of childhood TBI. The results indicate that more severe injuries caused a reduction in gray and white brain matter, while all TBI severity levels resulted in increased volumes of cerebrospinal fluid and smaller hippocampal volumes. In addition, enlarged amygdala volumes were detected in severely injured patients compared to their mild and moderate counterparts, suggesting that childhood TBI may disrupt the development of certain brain regions through diffuse pathological changes. The findings highlight the lasting impact of childhood TBI on the brain and the importance of monitoring brain structure in the long-term after early injury. (C) 2010 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Live-imaging of PKC Translocation in Sf9 Cells and in Aplysia Sensory Neurons	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 50; PKC; translocation; live-imaging; confocal microscopy; Sf9 cells; Aplysia; microinjection of plasmid DNA; neurons		Protein kinase Cs ( PKCs) are serine threonine kinases that play a central role in regulating a wide variety of cellular processes such as cell growth and learning and memory. There are four known families of PKC isoforms in vertebrates: classical PKCs ( a, aI, aII and.), novel type I PKCs ( e and.), novel type II PKCs ( d and.), and atypical PKCs (. and.). The classical PKCs are activated by Ca2+ and diacylclycerol ( DAG), while the novel PKCs are activated by DAG, but are Ca2+- independent. The atypical PKCs are activated by neither Ca2+ nor DAG. In Aplysia californica, our model system to study memory formation, there are three nervous system specific PKC isoforms one from each major class, namely the conventional PKC Apl I, the novel type I PKC Apl II and the atypical PKC Apl III. PKCs are lipid- activated kinases and thus activation of classical and novel PKCs in response to extracellular signals has been frequently correlated with PKC translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Therefore, visualizing PKC translocation in real time in live cells has become an invaluable tool for elucidating the signal transduction pathways that lead to PKC activation. For instance, this technique has allowed for us to establish that different isoforms of PKC translocate under different conditions to mediate distinct types of synaptic plasticity and that serotonin ( 5HT) activation of PKC Apl II requires production of both DAG and phosphatidic acid ( PA) for translocation 1- 2. Importantly, the ability to visualize the same neuron repeatedly has allowed us, for example, to measure desensitization of the PKC response in exquisite detail 3. In this video, we demonstrate each step of preparing Sf9 cell cultures, cultures of Aplysia sensory neurons have been described in another video article 4, expressing fluorescently tagged PKCs in Sf9 cells and in Aplysia sensory neurons and live- imaging of PKC translocation in response to different activators using laser- scanning microscopy.

This notion has been strengthened by the demonstration that three vesicular glutamate transporters (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), VGLUT2 and VGLUT3) are present in central monoamine, acetylcholine and GABA neurons, as well as in primarily glutamatergic neurons. Thus, intriguing questions are raised about the morphological and functional organization of neuronal systems endowed with such a dual signalling capacity. In addition to glutamate co-release, vesicular synergy - a process leading to enhanced packaging of the 'primary' transmitter - is increasingly recognized as a major property of the glutamatergic co-phenotype. The behavioural relevance of this co-phenotype is presently the focus of considerable interest.

Demyelination and degeneration in the injured human spinal cord detected with diffusion and magnetization transfer MRI	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Spinal cord injury; Diffusion-weighted MRI; Magnetization transfer; Atrophy; ASIA	MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS BRAIN; INDUCED B-0 FLUCTUATIONS; WHITE-MATTER PATHOLOGY; ANGULAR RESOLUTION; AXONAL INJURY; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; MULTIEXPONENTIAL T-2; TENSOR TRACTOGRAPHY; FIBER ORIENTATIONS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM	Characterizing demyelination/degeneration of spinal pathways in traumatic spinal cord injured (SCI) patients is crucial for assessing the prognosis of functional rehabilitation. Novel techniques based on diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetization transfer (MT) imaging provide sensitive and specific markers of white matter pathology. In this paper we combined for the first time high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI), MT imaging and atrophy measurements to evaluate the cervical spinal cord of fourteen SCI patients and age-matched controls. We used high in-plane resolution to delineate dorsal and ventrolateral pathways. Significant differences were detected between patients and controls in the normal-appearing white matter for fractional anisotropy (FA, p < 0.0001), axial diffusivity (p < 0.05), radial diffusivity (p < 0.05), generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA, p < 0.0001), magnetization transfer ratio (MTR, p < 0.0001) and cord area (p < 0.05). No significant difference was detected in mean diffusivity (p = 0.41), T1-weighted (p = 0.76) and 12-weighted (p = 0.09) signals. MRI metrics were remarkably well correlated with clinical disability (Pearson's correlations, FA: p < 0.01, GFA: p < 0.01, radial diffusivity: p = 0.01, MTR: p = 0.04 and atrophy: p < 0.01). Stepwise linear regressions showed that measures of MTR in the dorsal spinal cord predicted the sensory disability whereas measures of MTR in the ventrolateral spinal cord predicted the motor disability (ASIA score). However, diffusion metrics were not specific to the sensorimotor scores. Due to the specificity of axial and radial diffusivity and MT measurements, results suggest the detection of demyelination and degeneration in SCI patients. Combining HARDI with MT imaging is a promising approach to gain specificity in characterizing spinal cord pathways in traumatic injury. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

They occur during seizures and interictally and seem important in seizure genesis. We investigated whether interictal and ictal HFOs occur in the same regions and how they relate to epileptiform spikes. Methods: In 25 patients, spikes, ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (FR: 250-500 Hz) and their co-occurrences were marked during interictal slow wave sleep (5-10 min), during 10 pre-ictal seconds and 5 s following seizure onset. We compared occurrence and spatial distribution between these periods. Results: HFOs and spikes increased from interictal to ictal periods: the percentage of time occupied by ripples increased from 2.3% to 6.5%, FR from 0.2% to 0.8%, spikes from 1.1% to 4.8%. HFOs increased from interictal to pre-ictal periods in contrast to spikes. Spikes were in different channels in the interictal, pre-ictal and ictal periods whereas HFOs largely remained in the same channels. Conclusions: HFOs remain confined to the same, possibly epileptogenic, area, during interictal and ictal periods, while spikes are more widespread during seizures than interictally. Significance: Ictal and interictal HFOs represent the same (epileptogenic) area and are probably similar phenomena. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

As most parametric supervised automatic image segmentation and classification methods base their assumptions regarding the intensity distributions on a standardized intensity range, intensity normalization takes on a very significant role. One of the fast and accurate approaches proposed for intensity normalization is that of Nyul and colleagues. In this work, we present, for the first time, an extensive validation of this approach in real clinical domain where even after intensity inhomogeneity correction that accounts for scanner-specific artifacts, the MRI volumes can be affected from variations such as data heterogeneity resulting from multi-site multi-scanner acquisitions. the presence of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and the stage of disease progression in the brain. Using the distributional divergence criteria, we evaluate the effectiveness of the normalization in rendering, under the distributional assumptions of segmentation approaches, intensities that are more homogenous for the same tissue type while simultaneously resulting in better tissue type separation. We also demonstrate the advantage of the decile based piece-wise linear approach on the task of MS lesion segmentation against a linear normalization approach over three image segmentation algorithms: a standard Bayesian classifier, an outlier detection based approach and a Bayesian classifier with Markov Random Field (MRF) based post-processing. Finally, to demonstrate the independence of the effectiveness of normalization from the complexity of segmentation algorithm, we evaluate the Nyul method against the linear normalization on Bayesian algorithms of increasing complexity including a standard Bayesian classifier with Maximum Likelihood parameter estimation and a Bayesian classifier with integrated data priors, in addition to the above Bayesian classifier with MRF based post-processing to smooth the posteriors. In all relevant cases, the observed results are verified for statistical relevance using significance tests. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has recently been shown that THRPPMWSPVWP binds to the TfR and is subsequently internalized into TfR-expressing cells. Here, we evaluated the ability of THRPPMWSPVWP to become internalized into human TfR-expressing cells via endocytosis to determine its potential to act as a carrier system for the transport of small molecules across the BBB. To validate the underlying concept of a conjugate consisting of a small brain imaging tracer and a large peptidic carrier molecule, a conjugate of the high affinity D2 receptor ligand fallypride and the TfR targeting peptide THRPPMWSPVWP has been synthesized. Furthermore, two derivatives of THRPPMWSPVWP were labeled with Ga-68 in high radiochemical yields (> 96%) and a radiochemical purity of 96-98% and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The fallypride-THRPPMWSPVWP conjugate still displayed a K (i) of 27 nM. The uptake of the Ga-68-labeled peptides into TfR-bearing cells was investigated using U87MG and HT-29 cells to assess the capability of the peptide to act as a carrier molecule targeting the TfR. The in vitro binding studies revealed negligible uptake of the tested Ga-68-labeled conjugates ranging from 0.08% to 0.66% after 60 min incubation at 37A degrees C. Initial in vivo experiments with Ga-68-DOTA-S-maleimido-THRPPMWSPVWP in two healthy rats showed a mean brain uptake of 0.037% injected dose per gram, confirming the results obtained in vitro. These results suggest that the accumulation of the Ga-68-radiolabeled conjugates of the TfR-binding peptide THRPPMWSPVWP into TFR expressing human cell lines is nonspecific and too low to render this peptide suitable as a possible carrier molecule for a receptor-mediated transport of compounds across the BBB.

Review article: the design of clinical trials in hepatic encephalopathy - an International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism (ISHEN) consensus statement	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Review							ACQUIRED HEPATOCEREBRAL DEGENERATION; INHIBITORY CONTROL TEST; LIVER-TRANSPLANTATION; SCORING ALGORITHM; WORKING PARTY; FINAL REPORT; CIRRHOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; LACTULOSE; QUANTIFICATION	P>Background The clinical classification of hepatic encephalopathy is largely subjective, which has led to difficulties in designing trials in this field. Aims To review the current classification of hepatic encephalopathy and to develop consensus guidelines on the design and conduct of future clinical trials. Methods A round table was convened at the 14th International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism (ISHEN) meeting. Key discussion points were the nomenclature of hepatic encephalopathy and the selection of patients, standards of care and end-points for assessing the treatment and secondary prevention of hepatic encephalopathy. Results It was generally agreed that severity assessment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis, whether made clinically or more objectively, should be continuous rather than categorical, and a system for assessing the SONIC (Spectrum of Neuro-cognitive Impairment in Cirrhosis) was proposed. Within this system, patients currently classified as having minimal hepatic encephalopathy and Grade I hepatic encephalopathy would be classified as having Covert hepatic encephalopathy, whereas those with apparent clinical abnormalities would continue to be classified as overt hepatic encephalopathy. Some aspects of the terminology require further debate. Consensus was also reached on the patient populations, standards of care and endpoints to assess clinical trial outcomes. However, some compromises had to be made as there is considerable inter- and intravariability in the availability of some of the more objective surrogate performance markers. Conclusions The objectives of the round table were met. Robust, defendable guidelines for the conduct of future studies into hepatic encephalopathy have been provided. Outstanding issues are few and will continue to be discussed.	[Bajaj, J. S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Richmond, VA 23249 USA; [Bajaj, J.

N-WASp is required for Schwann cell cytoskeletal dynamics, normal myelin gene expression and peripheral nerve myelination	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Myelination; Schwann cells; N-WASp (Wasl); Mouse	ENTEROPATHOGENIC ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ACTIN PEDESTAL FORMATION; AXON ENSHEATHMENT; GROWTH CONES; MOUSE; DIFFERENTIATION; BETA-1-INTEGRIN; TRANSCRIPTION; EXTENSION; PROTEIN	Schwann cells elaborate myelin sheaths around axons by spirally wrapping and compacting their plasma membranes. Although actin remodeling plays a crucial role in this process, the effectors that modulate the Schwann cell cytoskeleton are poorly defined. Here, we show that the actin cytoskeletal regulator, neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASp), is upregulated in myelinating Schwann cells coincident with myelin elaboration. When N-WASp is conditionally deleted in Schwann cells at the onset of myelination, the cells continue to ensheath axons but fail to extend processes circumferentially to elaborate myelin. Myelin-related gene expression is also severely reduced in the N-WASp-deficient cells and in vitro process and lamellipodia formation are disrupted. Although affected mice demonstrate obvious motor deficits these do not appear to progress, the mutant animals achieving normal body weights and living to advanced age. Our observations demonstrate that N-WASp plays an essential role in Schwann cell maturation and myelin formation.

Its role in the central nervous system has not been fully elucidated. Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with an acute inflammatory response, which contributes to secondary tissue damage that worsens functional loss. We show here, with the use of hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS) deficient mice and a HPGDS selective inhibitor (HQL-79), that PGD(2) plays a detrimental role after SCI. We also show that HPGDS is expressed in macrophages in the injured mouse spinal cord and contributes to the increase in PGD(2) in the contused spinal cord. HPGDS(-/-) mice also show reduced secondary tissue damage and reduced expression of the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL10 as well as an increase in IL-6 and TGF beta-1 expression in the injured spinal cord. This was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of the microglia/macrophage activation marker Mac-2 and an increase in the antioxidant metallothionein III. Importantly, HPGDS deficient mice exhibit significantly better locomotor recovery after spinal cord contusion injury than wild-type (Wt) mice. In addition, systemically administered HPGDS inhibitor (HQL-79) also enhanced locomotor recovery after SCI in Wt mice. These data suggest that PGD(2) generated via HPGDS has detrimental effects after SCI and that blocking the activity of this enzyme can be beneficial. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Renoult, L; Debruille, JB				Renoult, Louis; Debruille, J. Bruno			N400-like Potentials and Reaction Times Index Semantic Relations between Highly Repeated Individual Words	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; TEMPORAL-LOBE POTENTIALS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; BLIND SEPARATION; MEMORY-SYSTEMS; FUNCTIONAL MRI	The N400 ERP is an electrophysiological index of semantic processing. Its amplitude varies with the semantic category of words, their concreteness, or whether their meaning matches that of a preceding context. The results of a number of studies suggest that these effects could be markedly reduced or suppressed for stimuli that are repeated. Nevertheless, we have recently shown that significant effects of semantic matching and category could be obtained on N400-like potentials elicited by massively repeated target words in a prime-target semantic categorization task. If such effects could be obtained when primes also are repeated, it would then be possible to study the semantic associations between individual words. The present study thus aimed to test this hypothesis while (1) controlling for a potential contribution of physical matching to the processing of repeated targets and (2) testing if the N400-like effects obtained in these conditions are modulated by task instruction, as are classic N400 effects. Two category words were used as primes and two exemplars as targets. In one block of trials, subjects had to respond according to the semantic relation between prime and target (semantic instruction) and, in another block, they had to report changes in letter case (physical instruction). Results showed that the amplitude of the N400-like ERP obtained was modulated by semantic matching and category but not by letter case. The effect of semantic matching was observed only in the semantic instruction block. Interestingly, the effect of category was not modulated by task instruction. An independent component analysis showed that the component that made the greatest contribution to the effect of semantic matching in the time window of the N400-like potential had a scalp distribution similar to that reported for the N400 and was best fit as a bilateral generator in the superior temporal gyrus. The use of repetition could thus allow, at least in explicit semantic tasks, a drastic simplification of N400 protocols. Highly repeated individual words could be used to study semantic relations between individual concepts.	[Debruille, J.

Cholinergic depletion in the nucleus accumbens: Effects on amphetamine response and sensorimotor gating	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Acetylcholine; Immunotoxin; Schizophrenia; Ventral striatum	MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPAL-LESIONS; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; PREPULSE INHIBITION; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANIMAL-MODEL; ACOUSTIC STARTLE; RAT-BRAIN; ADULT-RAT	A delicate balance between dopaminergic and cholinergic activity in the ventral striatum or nucleus accumbens (N.Acc) appears to be important for optimal performance of a wide range of behaviours. While functional interactions between these systems are complex, some data suggest that acetylcholine in the N.Acc. may dampen the effects of excessive dopamine (DA) release. We proposed that a reduction in the density of cholinergic interneurons in the N.Acc would result in behavioural alterations suggestive of a hyper-responsiveness of the N.Acc DA system. The present study aimed to produce a sustainable depletion of cholinergic neurons in the N.Acc in the rat and study the effects of such lesions on DA-dependent behaviour. A novel saporin immunotoxin targeting choline acetyltransferase was microinjected bilaterally into the N.Acc of adult rats. We confirmed histologically that two weeks post-injection, animals show a local, selective depletion of cholinergic interneurons (mean cell loss of 44%). Cholinergic-depleted rats showed a marked increase in the locomotor activating effects of amphetamine. In addition, such lesions induced a disruption of sensorimotor gating processes, reflected in a reduction in the prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, which was reversed by haloperidol. These data are suggestive of pronounced hyper-responsiveness of the meso-accumbens DA system which may be of relevance to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a condition where selective reduction in the number of ventral striatal cholinergic neurons has been demonstrated.

J	Iliescu, A; Gravel, M; Horth, C; Apuzzo, S; Gros, P				Iliescu, Alexandra; Gravel, Michel; Horth, Cynthia; Apuzzo, Sergio; Gros, Philippe			Transmembrane Topology of Mammalian Planar Cell Polarity Protein Vangl1	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; INNER-EAR; LOOP-TAIL; ASYMMETRIC LOCALIZATION; GENETIC-BASIS; PDZ DOMAINS; HAIR-CELLS; MOUSE; MUTATIONS; MECHANISMS	Vangl1 and Vangl2 are membrane proteins that play an important role in neurogenesis, and Vangl1/Vangl2 mutations cause neural tube defects in mice and humans. At the cellular level, Vangl proteins regulate the establishment of planar cell polarity (PCP), a process requiring membrane assembly of asymmetrically distributed multiprotein complexes that transmit polarity information to neighboring cells. The membrane topology of Vangl proteins and the protein segments required for structural and functional aspects of multiprotein membrane PCP complexes is unknown. We have used epitope tagging and immunofluorescence to establish the secondary structure of Vangl proteins, including the number, position, and polarity of transmembrane domains. Antigenic hemagglutinin A (HA) peptides (YYDVPDYS) were inserted in predicted intra- or extracellular loops of Vangl1 at positions 18, 64, 139, 178, 213, and 314, and individual mutant variants were stably expressed at the membrane of MDCK polarized cells. The membrane topology of the exofacial HA tag was determined by a combination of immunofluorescence in intact (extracellular epitopes) and permeabilized (intracellular epitopes) cells and by surface labeling. Results indicate that Vangl proteins have a four-transmembrane domain structure with the N-terminal portion (HA18 and HA64) and the large C-terminal portion (HA314) of the protein being intracellular. Topology mapping and hydropathy profiling show that the loop delineated by TMD1-2 (HA139) and TMD3-4 (HA213) is extracellular while the segment separating predicted TMD2-3 (HA178) is intracellular. This secondary structure reveals a compact membrane-associated portion with very short predicted extra- and intracellular loops, while the protein harbors a large intracellular domain.

Vibration Influences Haptic Perception of Surface Compliance During Walking	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN BALANCE CONTROL; CUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTIVE AFFERENTS; PLANTAR SOLE; DISCRIMINATION; ADAPTATION; LOCOMOTION; SOFTNESS; TEXTURE; NEUROPATHY; FOOTSTEPS	Background: The haptic perception of ground compliance is used for stable regulation of dynamic posture and the control of locomotion in diverse natural environments. Although rarely investigated in relation to walking, vibrotactile sensory channels are known to be active in the discrimination of material properties of objects and surfaces through touch. This study investigated how the perception of ground surface compliance is altered by plantar vibration feedback. Methodology/Principal Findings: Subjects walked in shoes over a rigid floor plate that provided plantar vibration feedback, and responded indicating how compliant it felt, either in subjective magnitude or via pairwise comparisons. In one experiment, the compliance of the floor plate was also varied. Results showed that perceived compliance of the plate increased monotonically with vibration feedback intensity, and depended to a lesser extent on the temporal or frequency distribution of the feedback. When both plate stiffness ( inverse compliance) and vibration amplitude were manipulated, the effect persisted, with both factors contributing to compliance perception. A significant influence of vibration was observed even for amplitudes close to psychophysical detection thresholds. Conclusions/Significance: These findings reveal that vibrotactile sensory channels are highly salient to the perception of surface compliance, and suggest that correlations between vibrotactile sensory information and motor activity may be of broader significance for the control of human locomotion than has been previously acknowledged.

S. suis is also recognized as a zoonotic agent and expresses several virulence factors. The recently identified subtilisin-like protease (SspA) of S. suis plays an important role in the pathogenicity of this bacterium in animal models. The objective of the present study was to clone, purify, and characterize the SspA of serotype 2 S. suis P1/7. The SSU0757 gene encoding SspA was amplified and a 4798-bp DNA fragment was obtained. It was cloned into the expression plasmid pBAD/HisB and then inserted into Escherichia coli to overproduce the protein. The recombinant protease was purified by chromatography procedures and showed a molecular weight of 170 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Its activity was optimal at pH 7 and at temperatures ranging from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C. It had a high specificity for the chromogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNa while specific inhibitors of serine proteases inhibited its activity. In addition to degrading gelatin, the protease hydrolyzed the A alpha chain of fibrinogen, which prevented fibrin formation by thrombin. The recombinant subtilisin-like protease also showed toxicity towards brain microvascular endothelial cells. Lastly, sera from pigs infected with S. suis reacted with the recombinant SspA, indicating that it is produced during infections. In conclusion, the SspA of S. suis shared similarities with subtilisin-like proteases produced by other pathogenic streptococci and may contribute to the pathogenic process of S. suis infections.

This regulation is dependent on activation of PKC, a well known effector of the type 1 NT receptor (NTR1). Because PKC phosphorylation of the D2R has recently been shown to induce its internalization, we hypothesized that NT acts to reduce D2R function through heterologous desensitization of the D2R. In the present study, we first used HEK-293 cells to demonstrate that NT induces PKC-dependent D2R internalization. Furthermore, internalization displayed faster kinetics in cells expressing the D2R short isoform, known to act as an autoreceptor in DA neurons, than in cells expressing the long isoform, known to act as a postsynaptic D2R. In patch clamp experiments on cultured DA neurons, overexpression of a mutant D2S lacking three key PKC phosphorylation sites abrogated the ability of NT to reduce D2R-mediated cell firing inhibition. Short interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of beta-arrestin1 and dynamin2, proteins important for receptor desensitization, reduced agonist-induced desensitization of D2R function, but only the inhibition of beta-arrestin1 reduced the effect of NT on D2R function. Taken together, our data suggest that NT acutely regulates D2 autoreceptor function and DA neuron excitability through PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the D2R, leading to heterologous receptor desensitization.

The D2 dopamine autoreceptor (D2-AR) exerts tight regulatory control of axonal dopamine (DA) release through a mechanism suggested to involve K(+) channels. To evaluate the contribution of Kv1 voltage-gated potassium channels of the Shaker gene family to the regulation of axonal DA release by the D2-AR, the present study employed expression analyses, real time measurements of striatal DA overflow, K(+) current measurements and immunoprecipitation assays. Kv1.1, -1.2, -1.3, and -1.6 mRNA and protein were detected in midbrain DA neurons purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and in primary DA neuron cultures. In addition, Kv1.1, -1.2, and -1.6 were localized to DA axonal processes in the dorsal striatum. By means of fast scan cyclic voltammetry in striatal slice preparations, we found that the inhibition of stimulation-evoked DA overflow by a D2 agonist was attenuated by Kv1.1, -1.2, and -1.6 toxin blockers. A particular role for the Kv1.2 subunit in the process whereby axonal D2-AR inhibits DA overflow was established with the use of a selective Kv1.2 blocker and Kv1.2 knock-out mice. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of D2-AR activation to increase Kv1.2 currents in co-transfected cells and its reliance on G beta gamma subunit signaling along with the physical coupling of D2-AR and Kv1.2-containing channels in striatal tissue. These findings underline the contribution of Kv1.2 in the regulation of nigrostriatal DA release by the D2-AR and thereby offer a novel mechanism by which DA release is regulated.

Astrocytes Control Glutamate Receptor Levels at Developing Synapses through SPARC-beta-Integrin Interactions	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; AMPA RECEPTOR; SILENT SYNAPSES; D-SERINE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; CNS SYNAPTOGENESIS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IN-VITRO; GLIA	Neurons recruit numerous mechanisms to facilitate the development of synaptic connections. However, little is known about activity-dependent mechanisms that control the timing and fidelity of this process. Here we describe a novel pathway used by neurons to regulate glutamate receptors at maturing central synapses. This pathway relies on communication between neurons and astrocytes and the ability of astrocytes to release the factor SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine). SPARC expression is dynamically regulated and plays a critical role in determining the level of synaptic AMPARs. SPARC ablation in mice increases excitatory synapse function, causes an abnormal accumulation of surface AMPARs at synapses, and impairs synaptic plasticity during development. We further demonstrate that SPARC inhibits the properties of neuronal beta 3-integrin complexes, which are intimately coupled to AMPAR stabilization at synapses. Thus neuron-glial signals control glutamate receptor levels at developing synapses to enable activity-driven modifications of synaptic strength.

Evaluation of a flexible force sensor for measurement of helmet foam impact performance	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Impact biomechanics; Head injury; Helmets; Concussion; Material testing	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; HEAD-INJURY; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; ACCELERATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; BIOMECHANICS; CONCUSSION; FOOTBALL; CRITERIA	The association between translational head acceleration and concussion remains unclear and provides a weak predictive measure for this type of injury; thus, alternative methods of helmet evaluation are warranted. Recent finite element analysis studies suggest that better estimates of concussion risk can be obtained when regional parameters of the cranium, brain and surrounding tissues are included. Lacking, however, are empirical data at the head-helmet interface with regards to contact area and force. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate a system to capture the impact force distribution of helmet foams. Thirteen Flexiforce (R) sensors were arranged in a 5 x 5 cm array, secured to a load cell. Three densities of foam were repeatedly impacted with 5J of energy during ambient (20 degrees C) and cold (-25 degrees C) conditions. RMS error, calculated relative to the global force registered by the load cell, was < 1.5% of the measurement range during individual calibration of the Flexiforce (R) sensors. RMS error was 5% of the measured range for the global force estimated by the sensor array. Load distribution measurement revealed significant differences between repeated impacts of cold temperature foams for which acceleration results were non-significant. The sensor array, covering only 36% of the total area, possessed sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to capture dynamic load distribution patterns. Implementation of this force mapping system is not limited to helmet testing. Indeed it may be adopted to assess other body regions vulnerable to contact injuries (e.g., chest, hip and shin protectors). (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sleep disorders and fatigue in multiple sclerosis: Evidence for association and interaction	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; Sleep disorders; Sleep-disordered breathing; Fatigue; Restless legs syndrome; Periodic leg movements	RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; AIRWAY-RESISTANCE SYNDROME; APNEA SYNDROME; TNF-ALPHA; INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA; BEHAVIOR DISORDER; CANCER-PATIENTS; BRAIN ATROPHY; BASAL GANGLIA	Fatig ue is highly prevalent in multiple sclerosis (MS). It appears to be multifactorial, with "primary" or disease-related factors involved, as well as "secondary" factors, including comorbidities. Sleep disturbances are frequent in MS as well, and often result from disease-related factors. Subjective sleep disturbances in MS have been extensively studied and have been associated with fatigue. Sleep disorders in the general population have been associated with fatigue as well. However, data on objectively diagnosed sleep disorders in MS are less conclusive. Studies of sleep in MS have often suffered from low numbers of study subjects and suboptimal methodology. We review the current knowledge on sleep disturbances in MS and the relationship to fatigue. Data from neuroimaging studies and studies of molecular consequences of sleep disorders in the general population, with particular attention to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), are briefly reviewed. Potential biologic interactions with MS are discussed in this context. We conclude that further studies of sleep disorders in MS are needed, to objectively establish their significance in this disease, and also to document any impact of treatment of sleep disorders on biologic and clinical outcomes such as fatigue.

Although several studies have shown occipital regions of CB to be involved in nonvisual processing, whether the functional organization of the visual cortex observed in sighted individuals (SI) is maintained in the rewired occipital regions of the blind has only been recently investigated. In the present functional MRI study, we compared the brain activity of CB and SI processing either the spatial or the pitch properties of sounds carrying information in both domains (i.e., the same sounds were used in both tasks), using an adaptive procedure specifically designed to adjust for performance level. In addition to showing a substantial recruitment of the occipital cortex for sound processing in CB, we also demonstrate that auditory-spatial processing mainly recruits the right cuneus and the right middle occipital gyrus, two regions of the dorsal occipital stream known to be involved in visuospatial/motion processing in SI. Moreover, functional connectivity analyses revealed that these reorganized occipital regions are part of an extensive brain network including regions known to underlie audiovisual spatial abilities (i.e., intraparietal sulcus, superior frontal gyrus). We conclude that some regions of the right dorsal occipital stream do not require visual experience to develop a specialization for the processing of spatial information and to be functionally integrated in a preexisting brain network dedicated to this ability.

Methods: DNA sequencing and cloning were used to identify a mutation in TrkB, and four different cell lines were used to assess functionality. Clinical samples were from a 22-year longitudinal cohort representative of the Quebec general population (n = 640 subjects), randomly selected when they were in kindergarten. Anxiety-related traits were measured with the Social Behaviour Questionnaire, the Diagnostic Assessment of Personality Pathology-Brief Questionnaire, and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IIIR. Results: An 11 base pair deletion in TrkB is significantly associated with increases in anxiety traits during childhood and the development of anxiety disorders in adulthood. We found that this deletion impaired transcription in some human cell lines. Conclusions: The identification of this deletion provides additional support for the role of TrkB in modulating anxiety-related traits in human.

Though PD is known to initially affect subcortical regions, the cortex also exhibits neuronal loss in the course of the disease as post mortem studies have shown. So far, PD-related pattern of cortical damage remains unclear, because of disease-caused heterogeneity, and also in part because of methodological issues such as the limitations of Voxel Based Morphometry. Here corticometry was used, a technique that decouples local surface from thickness, to obtain a better picture of PD corticomorphometric patterns. We acquired MRI volumes for 33 healthy controls (HC) and 49 PD patients, extracted local cortical thickness and surface area and modeled both of them as a function of group and age for each participant. Cortical thickness averaged on the whole cortex did not differ between the two groups while mean surface area was significantly larger in the PD group. The bilateral parietal lobule, the right superior frontal gyrus, the left cingulate cortex and the left insular cortex exhibited larger local surface area in the PD group. The right precuneus exhibited cortical thinning associated with age in the PD group and not in the HC group. Furthermore, cortical thinning was observed in the PD group compared with the control group in the left medial supplementary motor area (SMA) and in the right dorsal pre-SMA. Finally, we found the left temporal pole thickness to correlate with disease duration, as well as the bilateral occipital cortex and Broca's area. These results suggest that PD etiology is associated with specific cortical alterations, which could account for cognitive deficits that arise as the disease evolves. Finally, our results observed in the occipital cortex as a function of disease duration may indicate the increase in PD-related visuo-spatial deficits, which can sometimes result in hallucinations later on in the disease. In the future, MRI-generated corticometry, combined with additional behavioral markers, may prove to be a useful diagnosis tool to characterize the evolution of motor and cognitive deficits in PD.

S2D Grp	Excess of De Novo Deleterious Mutations in Genes Associated with Glutamatergic Systems in Nonsyndromic Intellectual Disability	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							SCAFFOLDING PROTEIN SHANK3; SWISS-MODEL WORKSPACE; KINESIN MOTOR KIF1A; MENTAL-RETARDATION; NMDA RECEPTORS; AMPA RECEPTORS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; CULTURED NEURONS; CELL-DEATH; PLASTICITY	Little is known about the genetics of nonsyndromic intellectual disability (NSID). We hypothesized that de novo mutations (DNMs) in synaptic genes explain an important fraction of sporadic NSID cases. In order to investigate this possibility, we sequenced 197 genes encoding glutamate receptors and a large subset of their known interacting proteins in 95 sporadic cases of NSID. We found 11 DNMs, including ten potentially deleterious mutations (three nonsense, two splicing, one frameshift, four missense) and one neutral mutation (silent) in eight different genes. Calculation of point-substitution DNM rates per functional and neutral site showed significant excess of functional DNMs compared to neutral ones. De novo truncating and/or splicing mutations in SYNGAP1, STXBP1, and SHANK3 were found in six patients and are likely to be pathogenic. De novo missense mutations were found in KIF1A, GRIN1, CACNG2, and EPB41L1. Functional studies showed that all these missense mutations affect protein function in cell culture systems, suggesting that they may be pathogenic. Sequencing these four genes in 50 additional sporadic cases of NSID identified a second DNM in GRIN1 (c.1679_1681dup/p.Ser560dup). This mutation also affects protein function, consistent with structural predictions. None of these mutations or any other DNMs were identified in these genes in 285 healthy controls. This study highlights the importance of the glutamate receptor complexes in NSID and further supports the role of DNMs in this disorder.

KChIP1 MODULATION OF Kv4.3-MEDIATED A-TYPE K+ CURRENTS AND REPETITIVE FIRING IN HIPPOCAMPAL INTERNEURONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						CA1 hippocampus; inhibitory neurons; excitability; K+ channels; accessory proteins	CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; STRATUM LACUNOSUM-MOLECULARE; POTASSIUM CHANNEL SUBUNIT; CEREBELLAR GRANULE CELLS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; FUNCTIONAL INTERACTION; I-TO; EXPRESSION; KV4.2; BRAIN	Neuronal A-type K+ channels regulate action potential waveform, back-propagation and firing frequency. In hippocampal CA1 interneurons located at the stratum lacunosum-moleculare/radiatum junction (LM/RAD), Kv4.3 mediates A-type K+ currents and a Kv4 beta-subunit of the Kv channel interacting protein (KChIP) family, KChIP1, appears specifically expressed in these cells. However, the functional role of this accessory subunit in A-type K+ currents and interneuron excitability remains largely unknown. Thus, first we studied KChIP1 and Kv4.3 channel interactions in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and determined that KChIP1 coexpression modulated the biophysical properties of Kv4.3 A-type currents (faster recovery from inactivation, leftward shift of activation curve, faster rise time and slower decay) and this modulation was selectively prevented by KChIP1 short interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown. Next, we evaluated the effects of KChIP1 down-regulation by siRNA on A-type K+ currents in LM/RAD interneurons in slice cultures. Recovery from inactivation of A-type K+ currents was slower after KChIP1 down-regulation but other properties were unchanged. In addition, down-regulation of KChIP1 levels did not affect action potential waveform and firing, but increased firing frequency during suprathreshold depolarizations, indicating that KChIP1 regulates interneuron excitability. The effects of KChIP1 down-regulation were cell-specific since CA1 pyramidal cells that do not express KChIP1 were unaffected. Overall, our findings suggest that KChIP1 interacts with Kv4.3 in LM/RAD interneurons, enabling faster recovery from inactivation of A-type currents and thus promoting stronger inhibitory control of firing during sustained activity.

MATERNAL HIGH-FAT INTAKE ALTERS PRESYNAPTIC REGULATION OF DOPAMINE IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS AND INCREASES MOTIVATION FOR FAT REWARDS IN THE OFFSPRING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						maternal diet; high-fat; development; dopamine; behavior	TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE ACTIVITY; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y SYSTEM; SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; HYPOTHALAMIC NEURONS; TRANSPORTER FUNCTION; ENERGY HOMEOSTASIS; AGONIST QUINPIROLE; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	High caloric intake during early postnatal development can have long term consequences for the offspring. We previously reported that the adult offspring of dams fed a high-fat diet during the last week of gestation and throughout lactation display blunted locomotor response to amphetamine (AMP) and reduced sensitization to the drug compared to offspring of control diet dams. Here, we report that the subsensitivity of high-fat offspring to AMP's locomotor stimulant action reflects, at least in part, altered regulation of nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine (DA) transmission. When compared to controls, the DA response of high-fat animals to AMP, as measured with microdialysis, was attenuated in the NAc, but unaffected in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). A relatively higher activity of NAc synaptosomal DA transporter sites without changes in vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) uptake capacity was also observed in high-fat offspring. Moreover, ventral tegmental area (VTA) D(2) receptor mRNA levels were decreased in high-fat offspring, suggesting a reduction in DA release-regulating D(2) autoreceptors in terminal regions such as the NAc. The magnitude of locomotor response to D(2/3) receptor activation (with quinpirole) was greater in high-fat than in control animals despite having comparable postsynaptic D(2) mRNA levels in the NAc. Finally, while operant responding for a sugar-enriched food reward did not differ between diet groups, high-fat offspring displayed increased operant responding for a fat-enriched reward compared to controls. These findings add to mounting evidence that early life exposure to elevated dietary maternal fat can lead to long lasting changes in DA-mediated behavioral responses to stimulant drugs and fat-enriched foods.

THE RESPONSE OF SPINAL MICROGLIA TO CHEMOTHERAPY-EVOKED PAINFUL PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES IS DISTINCT FROM THAT EVOKED BY TRAUMATIC NERVE INJURIES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						2 ' 3 '-dideoxycytidine; microglial hypertrophy; neuropathic pain; oxaliplatin; paclitaxel; vincristine	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; INDUCED MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; DORSAL-ROOT GANGLIA; ACETYL-L-CARNITINE; GLIAL ACTIVATION; SENSORY NEURONS; CYTOKINE EXPRESSION; LANGERHANS CELLS; SUPPORTING CELLS; SCIATIC-NERVE	Painful peripheral neuropathies produced by nerve trauma are accompanied by substantial axonal degeneration and by a response in spinal cord microglia that is characterized by hypertrophy and increased expression of several intracellular and cell-surface markers, including ionizing calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) and Cd11b (a complement receptor 3 antigen recognized by the OX42 antibody). The microglia response has been hypothesized to be essential for the pathogenesis of the neuropathic pain state. In contrast, the painful peripheral neuropathies produced by low doses of cancer chemotherapeutics do not produce degeneration of axons in the peripheral nerve, although they do cause partial degeneration of the sensory axons' distal-most tips, that is the intraepidermal nerve fibers that form the axons' terminal receptor arbors. The question thus arises as to whether the relatively minor and distal axonal injury characterizing the chemotherapy-evoked neuropathies is sufficient to evoke the microglial response that is seen after traumatic nerve injury. We examined the lumbar spinal cord of rats with painful peripheral neuropathies due to the antineoplastic agents, paclitaxel, vincristine, and oxaliplatin, and the anti-retroviral agent, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), and compared them to rats with a complete sciatic nerve transection and the partial sciatic nerve injury produced in the chronic constriction injury model (CCI). As expected, microglia hypertrophy and increased expression of Iba1 were pronounced in the nerve transection and CCI animals. However, there was no microglia hypertrophy or increased Iba1 staining in the animals treated with paclitaxel, vincristine, oxaliplatin, or ddC. These results suggest that the mechanisms that produce neuropathic pain after exposure to chemotherapeutics may be fundamentally different than those operating after nerve trauma. (C) 2011 IBRO.

Contributions of Indirect Pathways to Visual Response Properties in Macaque Middle Temporal Area MT	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; STRIATE CORTICAL-NEURONS; ALERT MACAQUE; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY; SMOOTH-PURSUIT; V1 NEURONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; SPATIAL SUMMATION	The primate visual cortex exhibits a remarkable degree of interconnectivity. Each visual area receives an average of 10 to 15 inputs, many of them from cortical areas with overlapping, but not identical, functional properties. In this study, we assessed the functional significance of this anatomical parallelism to the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque visual cortex. MT receives major feedforward inputs from areas V1, V2, and V3, but little is known about the properties of each of these pathways. We previously demonstrated that reversible inactivation of V2 and V3 causes a disproportionate degradation of tuning for binocular disparity of MT neurons, relative to direction tuning (Ponce et al., 2008). Here we show that MT neurons continued to encode speed and size information during V2/3 inactivation; however, many became significantly less responsive to fast speeds and others showed a modest decrease in surround suppression. These changes resemble previously reported effects of reducing stimulus contrast (Pack et al., 2005; Krekelberg et al., 2006), but we show here that they differ in their temporal dynamics. We find no evidence that the indirect pathways selectively target different functional regions within MT. Overall, our findings suggest that the indirect pathways to MT primarily convey modality-specific information on binocular disparity, but that they also contribute to the processing of stimuli moving at fast speeds.

However, a consistent, replicable pattern of relationships between alexithymia and different dreaming components has not yet been identified. Groups of sleep-disordered outpatients (N = 580; 46.0 +/- 13.2 years) and nonclinical controls (N = 145; 22.9 +/- 4.2 years) were administered the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and a 14-item Dreaming Questionnaire. Sleep diagnoses were assessed from polysomnography and clinical histories following the American Academy of Sleep Medicine classification system. The Dreaming Questionnaire was reduced by principal-components analysis to a 3-factor solution that distinguishes nightmare distress, dream recall, and dream meaning items. Factor coefficients were correlated with TAS total score and TAS subscales while age was controlled as a covariate. TAS total score was found to correlate positively with nightmare distress and negatively with dream recall for both clinical and nonclinical groups and for both men and women considered separately. TAS total score also correlated negatively with dream meaning for nonclinical participants. TAS subscales were differentially correlated with the 3 dream factors: difficulty identifying feelings (DIF) with increased nightmare distress, difficulty describing feelings (DDF) with decreased dream recall and externally oriented thinking (EOT) with decreased dream meaning. With some exceptions, these patterns were obtained independently for clinical and nonclinical groups and for men and women within these groups. Findings suggest a consistent and replicable pattern of relationships between alexithymia and dreaming components that implicates processes regulating emotion during both wakefulness and dreaming, for example, affect distress, expressive anxiety, and openness to experience.

Minimum Effective Volume of Lidocaine for Ultrasound-Guided Infraclavicular Block	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							BRACHIAL-PLEXUS BLOCK; EFFECTIVE ANESTHETIC VOLUME; DOUBLE-INJECTION; NERVE BLOCK; SINGLE; NEUROSTIMULATION; GUIDANCE; DESIGN	Background: The aim of this study was to determine the minimum effective volume of lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL in 90% of patients (MEV90) for single-injection ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block (ICB). Methods: Using an in-plane technique, a single-injection ultrasound-guided ICB was performed: a 17-gauge, 8-cm Tuohy needle was advanced until the tip was located dorsal to the axillary artery. Volume assignment was carried out using a biased coin design up-and-down sequential method, where the volume of local anesthetic administered to each patient depended on the response of the previous one. In case of failure, the next subject received a higher volume (defined as the previous volume with an increment of 2.5 mL). If the previous patient had a successful block, the next subject was randomized to a lower volume (defined as the previous volume with a decrement of 2.5 mL), with a probability of b = 0.11, or the same volume, with a probability of 1 - b = 0.89. Lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL was used in all subjects. Success was defined, at 30 mins, as a minimal score of 14 of 16 points using a composite scale encompassing sensory and motor block. Patients undergoing surgery of the elbow, forearm, wrist, or hand were prospectively enrolled until 45 successful blocks were obtained. Results: Fifty-five patients were included in the study. Using isotonic regression and bootstrap confidence interval (CI), the MEV90 for single-injection ultrasound-guided ICB was estimated to be 35 mL (95% CI, 30-37.5 mL). The probability of a successful response at 35 mL was estimated to be 0.91 (95% CI, 0.8-1.0). All patients with a minimal composite score of 14 points at 30 mins achieved surgical anesthesia intraoperatively. Conclusions: For single-injection ultrasound-guided ICB, the MEV90 of lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL is 35 mL. Further dose-finding studies are required for other concentrations of lidocaine, other local anesthetic agents as well as techniques involving multiple injections, a more medial approach to ICB, or precise location of all 3 cords of the brachial plexus.

We describe a pragmatic, evidence-based framework for engaging in empiric ethics inquiry for a large consortium of researchers in neurodevelopmental disorders and provide relevant case studies of pragmatic neuroethics. The 3 neurodevelopmental disorders that are at the focus of our research, cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), bring unique and intersecting challenges of translating ethically research into clinical care for children and neonates. We identify and discuss challenges related to health care delivery in CP; neonatal neurological decision making; alternative therapies; and identity, integrity, and personhood.

This article describes the results of an environmental scan of NeuroDevNet members using a survey of their existing practices and needs completed by 30% of NeuroDevNet's members (n = 36/120) and key informant interviews with 14 members. Results suggest that most members are somewhat engaged in a number of knowledge translation activities although they tend to be traditional ones, such as attending conferences and giving presentations to other researchers. There is very little in the way of public engagement or consumer-focused activities. It also describes activities underway at the Cerebral Palsy Demonstration Project.

As a heterogeneous disorder in all its disparate aspects it defies a simplistic research approach that seeks to further our understanding of its mechanisms, outcomes and treatments. Within NeuroDevNet, with its focus on abnormal brain development, cerebral palsy was selected as one of the three neurodevelopmental disabilities to be the focus of a dedicated demonstration project. The Cerebral Palsy Demonstration Project will feature a multidimensional approach utilizing epidemiologic, imaging, genetics, animal models and stem cell modalities that will at all times emphasize clinical relevance, translation into practice, and potential synergies between investigators now segregated by both academic disciplines and geographic distance.

Our interdisciplinary team aims to improve understanding of genetic factors underlying vulnerability to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) to develop better diagnostic strategies and, ultimately, to pinpoint molecular pathways relevant to developing biologically based treatments. Linking our existing longitudinal ASD cohorts with both genetics and neuroimaging studies will provide, for the first time, integrated data on how the genetic variation influences brain and behavioral development in ASD. Importantly, as our science progresses and we translate this information to the health care system, we will also educate policy makers, media, and business, so an informed society is prepared to capitalize on new genomic advances and effectively integrate these into health services for the broader community. We believe that this research has the potential to transform assessment and care for individuals with ASD. Semin Pediatr Neurol 18:40-48 (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite extensive research, a unique neurobehavioral profile for children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure remains elusive. A fundamental question that must be addressed is how genetic and environmental factors interact with gestational alcohol exposure to produce neurobehavioral and neurobiological deficits in children. The core objectives of the NeuroDevNet team in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is to create an integrated research program of basic and clinical investigations that will (1) identify genetic and epigenetic modifications that may be predictive of the neurobehavioral and neurobiological dysfunctions in offspring induced by gestational alcohol exposure and (2) determine the relationship between structural alterations in the brain induced by gestational alcohol exposure and functional outcomes in offspring. The overarching hypothesis to be tested is that neurobehavioral and neurobiological dysfunctions induced by gestational alcohol exposure are correlated with the genetic background of the affected child and/or epigenetic modifications in gene expression. The identification of genetic and/or epigenetic markers that are predictive of the severity of behavioral and cognitive deficits in children affected by gestational alcohol exposure will have a profound impact on our ability to identify children at risk.

We addressed the possibility that unilateral temporal lobe damage might be sufficient to impair fear recognition in voices. For this purpose, we tested patients after left (n = 10) or right (n = 8) medial temporal lobe resection for the relief of intractable epilepsy using a set of nonverbal vocalizations (Belin, Fillion-Bilodeau, & Gosselin, 2008). To focus more narrowly on the role of amygdala subparts, we differentiated patients with complete amygdala damage vs. damage limited to the basolateral complex of the amygdala. The results confirmed for the first time that unilateral amygdala lesion including the basolateral complex can selectively impair recognition of fear and surprise expressed by voices, supporting the notion that the amygdala is a multimodal structure. Interestingly, this impairment was observed in patients with incomplete resection of the amygdala that spared the central nucleus and the corticomedial complex, suggesting that a resection of the basolateral complex is sufficient to affect fear recognition. Given that fear has often been considered as a precursor of anxiety, we also investigated the effect of such lesions on self-reported anxiety. The same patients appeared to be less anxious than control participants in their mood questionnaires. The association of impaired fear perception and decreased anxiety level is considered in the light of recent human and animal data, providing support for a neurobiological basis of mood changes in patients with unilateral temporal lobe damage.

Various treatments have been administered with limited success to patients with GTS. For more than 40 years, the medication of choice has generally been neuroleptic medication. However, unwanted side effects often occur. For those patients, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies (CBT) have shown some success. CBT is considered an effective adjunct to medication, but the cognitive and cerebral effect of CBT has not so far been explored within a GTS population. The current research focuses on the hypothesis that significant symptom improvements in GTS, following CBT, will relate to cerebral activity changes. The aim of our research program was to compare motor Event-Related Potentials (ERP) recorded pre- and post-CBT in a population of GTS. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) and derived the ERPs of 10 GTS patients, matched with 14 controls on the basis of laterality, age and intelligence. A traffic light task was administered to extract ERPs related to response processing. Results revealed that GTS had reduced cortical activation related to the inhibition of responses, which normalized following CBT. The treatment may induce cerebral changes that significantly improve both motor performances and brain activity.

SVM based prediction of RNA-binding proteins using binding residues and evolutionary information	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR RECOGNITION			English	Article						evolutionary information; hybrid prediction method; RNA interacting residues; RNA binding proteins; SVM	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; PSI-BLAST; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; NEURAL-NETWORK; DIPEPTIDE COMPOSITION; ALIGNMENT; SEQUENCE; SEARCH; TURNS	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial role in transcription and gene-regulation. This paper describes a support vector machine (SVM) based method for discriminating and classifying RNA-binding and non-binding proteins using sequence features. With the threshold of 30% interacting residues, RNA-binding amino acid prediction method PPRINT achieved the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.32. BLAST and PSI-BLAST identified RBPs with the coverage of 32.63 and 33.16%, respectively, at the e-value of 1e-4. The SVM models developed with amino acid, dipeptide and four-part amino acid compositions showed the MCC of 0.60, 0.46, and 0.53, respectively. This is the first study in which evolutionary information in form of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profile has been successfully used for predicting RBPs. We achieved the maximum MCC of 0.62 using SVM model based on PSSM called PSSM-400. Finally, we developed different hybrid approaches and achieved maximum MCC of 0.66. We also developed a method for predicting three subclasses of RNA binding proteins (e. g., rRNA, tRNA, mRNA binding proteins). The performance of the method was also evaluated on an independent dataset of 69 RBPs and 100 non-RBPs (NBPs). An additional benchmarking was also performed using gene ontology (GO) based annotation. Based on the hybrid approach a web-server RNApred has been developed for predicting RNA binding proteins from amino acid sequences (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/rnapred/).

Misperceptions of speed are accounted for by the responses of neurons in macaque cortical area MT. J Neurophysiol 105: 1199-1211, 2011. First published December 29, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00213.2010.-In humans, the perceived speed of random dot patterns (RDP) moving within small apertures is faster than that of RDPs moving within larger apertures at the same physical speed. To investigate the neural basis of this illusion, we recorded the responses of direction-and speed-selective neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of macaque monkeys to stimuli varying in size and speed. Our results show that the preferred speed of MT neurons is slower for smaller stimuli. This effect was larger for neurons preferring faster speeds, matching our psychophysical observation in human subjects that the magnitude of the misperception is larger at higher stimulus speeds. Our physiological data indicate that, across a population of speed-tuned neurons in MT, decreasing the size of a stimulus would shift the activity profile to neurons tuned for higher speeds. Modeling a labeled-line readout of this shifted profile, we show an increased apparent speed, in line with the psychophysical observations. This link strengthens the evidence for a causal role of area MT in speed perception. The systematic shift in tuning curves of single neurons with stimulus size might reflect a general mechanism for feature-mismatch illusions in visual perception.

State of the art. - Analysis of the intracranial EEG by mathematical methods shows changes of the brain dynamics several minutes before the occurrence of partial seizures. These modifications can be widespread and not restricted to the epileptogenic focus, which would explain why they can also be detected from scalp EEG. Several scenarios could underlie the preictal state: a progressive recruitment of neurons or a facilitating state with a high probability of seizure occurrence. Because of the high rate of false predictions, no satisfactory method for seizure prediction has been currently proposed. Perspectives. - A European multicenter study (Evolving platform for improving living expectation of patients suffering from IctAl events [EPILEPSIAE]) is currently evaluating a combination of 44 methods applied for EEG and ECG analysis on long-term recordings obtained from a large multicenter database (www.epilepsiae.eu). Conclusion. - Combining analyses of multi-level signals including intracranial EEG and microelectrodes, scalp EEG and in vitro electrophysiological studies of post-operative tissues should help clarify brain dynamics during the pre-ictal state.

Since insoluble plaques are present in AD patients from early preclinical stages of the pathology, the point at which neuroinflammation first occurs in the progression of the AD pathology is still unknown. In this review we discuss the clinical and experimental evidence for the occurrence of inflammation in preclinical, asymptomatic phases of the progression of the AD pathology. In particular, we discuss the evidence from different transgenic models suggesting that a pro-inflammatory process might even be initiated prior to plaque deposition. The factors responsible for the early, pre-plaque inflammation are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the role of soluble A beta-oligomers. Furthermore, we analyze the consequences of the microglial activation and the deregulation of NGF metabolism, in the context of the earliest amyloid pathology. Finally, we propose MMP-9 as a promising biomarker for signalling early stages of an ongoing CNS inflammation.	[Ferretti, M. T.; Cuello, A.

However, findings from existing story memory tests have been mixed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We developed a test, the Story Learning and Memory (SLAM) test, in which a story is presented repeatedly until a performance criterion is reached, and verbatim recall is obtained only once, after a delay. In Study 1 we demonstrated a significant learning deficit in patients with left, but not right, TLE, and they were further impaired in retention of the story despite having learned it to the same criterion as subjects with right TLE and healthy subjects. These deficits remained confined to patients with left TLE after surgery. For clinical use we developed the SIAM in three versions in two languages; in studies 2 and 3 we tested and proved their equivalence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

White matter alterations exist prior to psychosis onset but its association with clinical outcome in the very early phase of psychosis is currently unknown. In the present study, white matter was assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) and healthy controls. Forty-four FEP patients and 30 matched healthy controls completed a DTI scan. The patient group was split in poor (n = 24) and good (n = 20) outcome subgroups based on 6-month clinical data. DTI tractography was used to estimate fractional anisotropy (FA) in the three main tracts connecting frontal and temporal regions (i.e. the cingulum, the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the uncinate fasciculus). The analyses showed selective FA reductions in both the uncinate and the superior longitudinal fasciculi, but not in the cingulum, when comparing FEP patients to healthy controls. FEP subgroup analyses revealed greater white matter changes in these tracts in patients with poor outcome as compared to patients with good outcome. These findings confirm that abnormal fronto-temporal connectivity contributes to the physiopathology of FEP and constitutes an early marker of clinical short-term outcome. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Although many strategies and technologies have been applied to siRNA design, a key issue lies in the selection of efficient design predictors. Furthermore, the development of systemic siRNA delivery strategies, which would enhance the therapeutic effect, remains a central issue. Areas covered: The review discusses the basic principles of the sequence-specific design criteria of functional siRNAs and possible chemical modifications. Some of the most recent advances in the development of siRNA design algorithms and delivery strategies are also presented. Emphasis is given to the important design rule sets and predictors which determine the functionality of an efficient siRNA. Expert opinion: The potential and limitations of efficient design predictors obtained from computational algorithms play a crucial role in the development of target-specific siRNAs. Furthermore, the future success of RNA interference therapeutics will depend on their ability to efficiently cross the physiological barriers, selectively target cells-of-interest and finally silence the gene-of-interest without any side effects.

Identification of a FUS splicing mutation in a large family with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article						amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; FUS/motor neuron disease; neurodegeneration; RNA-binding protein; splicing mutation	SOD1; ALS; TDP-43; GENE	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Genetic studies have led, thus far, to the identification of 12 loci and 9 genes for familial ALS (FALS). Although the distribution and impact of superoxide dismutase 1 mutations has been extensively examined for over a decade, the recently identified FALS-associated FUS gene has been less studied. Therefore, we set out to screen our collection of FALS cases for FUS mutations. All 15 exons of FUS were amplified and sequenced in 154 unrelated FALS cases and 475 ethnically matched healthy individuals. One substitution located in the acceptor splice site of intron 14 was identified in all affected members of a large family, causing the skipping of the last 13 amino acids of the protein and the translation of 7 novel amino acids, resulting from the new translation of a part of the 3' untranslated region. Our study identified a new splicing mutation in the highly conserved C-terminal of the FUS protein. Thus far most FUS mutations are missenses, and our findings, combined with those of others, confirm the importance of the C-terminal portion of the protein, adding additional support for FUS mutations having a critical role in ALS.

In AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), immunoreactive HO-1 protein is over-expressed in astrocytes and neurons of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and co-localizes to neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques and corpora amylacea. Astroglial induction of the Hmox1 gene by beta-amyloid, pro-inflammatory cytokines and hydrogen peroxide promotes mitochondrial sequestration of non-transferrin iron and macroautophagy and may thereby contribute to the pathological iron deposition and bioenergy failure amply documented in AD-affected neural tissues. Glial HO-1 expression may also impact cell survival and neuroplasticity in AD by modulating brain sterol/oxysterol metabolism and the degradation of tau by the proteasome. Suppression of glial HO-1 activity by pharmacological or other means may confer neuroprotection in AD by curtailing iron-mediated neurotoxicity.

Genetic and environmental influences on cancellation and restraint, response latency, and variability measured in a novel variant of the stop signal task were studied in 139 eight-year-old twin pairs from a birth cohort. Cancellation (50%), restraint (27%), and response latency (41%) showed significant heritability, the balance being non-shared environmental influences and/or error. Response variability was not heritable, with 23% of the variance attributable to shared environmental influences and 77% to non-shared environmental risk or error. The phenotypic correlation between response cancellation and restraint was -.44 and between response latency and restraint was .21. These phenotypic correlations were entirely genetic in origin. The phenotypic correlation between response variability and % successful inhibition was .27, but was not genetic. Cancellation and restraint were heritable and shared genetic influences, indicating that they may be influenced by a common gene or genes. Response latency was moderately heritable and shared genetic influences with restraint, but was not correlated with cancellation. Response variability was not heritable. These results support the potential of response inhibition and latency as endophenotypes in genetic research.

Establishment of Goat Embryonic Stem Cells From In Vivo Produced Blastocyst-Stage Embryos	MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							PREIMPLANTATION EMBRYOS; LINES; DERIVATION; GENERATION; EXPRESSION; CALVES	Embryonic stem (ES) cells with the capacity for germ line transmission have only been verified in mouse and rat. Methods for derivation, propagation, and differentiation of ES cells from domestic animals have not been fully established. Here, we describe derivation of ES cells from goat embryos. In vivo-derived embryos were cultured on goat fetal fibroblast feeders. Embryos either attached to the feeder layer or remained floating and expanded in culture. Embryos that attached showed a prominent inner cell mass (ICM) and those that remained floating formed structures resembling ICM disks surrounded by trophectodermal cells. ICM cells and embryonic disks were isolated mechanically, cultured on feeder cells in the presence of hLIF, and outgrown into ES-like colonies. Two cell lines were cultured for 25 passages and stained positive for alkaline phosphatase, POU5F1, NANOG, SOX2, SSEA-1, and SSEA-4. Embryoid bodies formed in suspension culture without hLIF. One cell line was cultured for 2 years (over 120 passages). This cell line differentiated in vitro into epithelia and neuronal cells, and could be stably transfected and selected for expression of a fluorescent marker. When cells were injected into SCID mice, teratomas were identified 5-6 weeks after transplantation. Expression of known ES cell markers, maintenance in vitro for 2 years in an undifferentiated state, differentiation in vitro, and formation of teratomas in immunodeficient mice provide evidence that the established cell line represents goat ES cells. This also is the first report of teratoma formation from large animal ES cells.

Arachidonic acid (AA) is a second messenger released from the neuronal membrane phospholipids following the stimulation of the receptors coupled with G-proteins to the cytosolic phospholipase A (cPLA(2)) signalling pathway. The signalling of several neurotransmitter systems which are deregulated in OBX rats (serotonergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic) converges on the cPLA(2) signalling pathway. The aim of the present study was to assess the incorporation coefficient k* [ml/g/s] of AA in a large number of brain regions in the OBX rat, as a parameter reflecting AA turnover. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (160-200 g) were randomly assigned into an intact Sprague-Dawley (SPD) group, a Sham-operated (SHAM) group or an olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) group (n = 5 per group). Two weeks following the surgeries (SHAM and OBX rats) or without any prior intervention (SPD rats), the k* was measured using [1-(14)C] AA autoradiography. Two-way ANOVA followed by the Newman-Keuls test revealed the following: (1) significantly increased AA turnover in the OBX rats, relative to the SHAM rats, in 17 out of 27 assessed brain regions; and (2) no significant differences in AA turnover between the SHAM and the SPD rats. The results suggest the upregulation of one or more neurotransmitter systems or receptors acting through the PLA(2) signalling pathway, or the components of the cPLA(2) signalling system itself. Taken together with the previous measurements, one can conclude that this elevation is likely related to upregulation in the brain serotonergic system because of the elevated 5-HT synthesis of the OBX rats.

False recognition in Lewy-body disease and frontotemporal dementia	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Frontotemporal dementia; Lewy-body disease; False recognition; DRM; Memory	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; FUZZY-TRACE THEORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MEMORY; BODIES; RECALL; GIST	The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the false recognition phenomenon in persons with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and those with Lewy-body disease (LBD). Patients with LBD (n = 10) or FTD (n = 15) and their corresponding controls (n = 30) were subjected to the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm to induce false recognition. Patients were first presented with items semantically related to a nonpresented critical target. The critical target was later included in a word list shown to patients to assess level of recognition. Both groups of patients showed a reduced level of false recognition of the critical target when controlling for their overall level of false alarms. This reduction was greater in persons with LBD than in those with FTD. Correlational analyses of performance on neuropsychological tests and the DRM variables indicated that the reduced DRM effect was associated with inhibition deficits in patients with LBD and with inhibition deficits and verbal memory in those with FTD. Our results support current models suggesting that these cognitive components contribute to the false recognition effect. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Trempe, M; Sabourin, M; Rohbanfard, H; Proteau, L				Trempe, Maxime; Sabourin, Maxime; Rohbanfard, Hassan; Proteau, Luc			Observation learning versus physical practice leads to different consolidation outcomes in a movement timing task	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Motor learning; Consolidation; Observation; Off-line learning; Stabilization	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; MIRROR-NEURON SYSTEM; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; TIME-COURSE; SLEEP; SKILL; PLASTICITY; INTERFERENCE; MECHANISMS; RECONSOLIDATION	Motor learning is a process that extends beyond training sessions. Specifically, physical practice triggers a series of physiological changes in the CNS that are regrouped under the term "consolidation'' (Stickgold and Walker 2007). These changes can result in between-session improvement or performance stabilization (Walker 2005). In a series of three experiments, we tested whether consolidation also occurs following observation. In Experiment 1, participants observed an expert model perform a sequence of arm movements. Although we found evidence of observation learning, no significant difference was revealed between participants asked to reproduce the observed sequence either 5 min or 24 h later (no between-session improvement). In Experiment 2, two groups of participants observed an expert model perform two distinct movement sequences (A and B) either 10 min or 8 h apart; participants then physically performed both sequences after a 24-h break. Participants in the 8-h group performed Sequence B less accurately compared to participants in the 5-min group, suggesting that the memory representation of the first sequence had been stabilized and that it interfered with the learning of the second sequence. Finally, in Experiment 3, the initial observation phase was replaced by a physical practice phase. In contrast with the results of Experiment 2, participants in the 8-h group performed Sequence B significantly more accurately compared to participants in the 5-min group. Together, our results suggest that the memory representation of a skill learned through observation undergoes consolidation. However, consolidation of an observed motor skill leads to distinct behavioural outcomes in comparison with physical practice.

Some investigators evoke dysfunctional cerebral mechanisms, while others ascribe them to the psychological consequences of the injury. We address this controversy by exploring possible cerebral dysfunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERP) in a group of patients during the post-acute phase. Fourteen MTBI symptomatic patients (5.7 +/- 2.9 months post-injury) were tested with fMRI and ERP using a visual externally ordered working memory task, and were compared with 23 control subjects. Attenuated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the left and right mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (mid-DLPFC), the putamen, the body of the caudate nucleus, and the right thalamus were found in the MTBI group compared with the control group. Moreover, symptom severity and BOLD signal changes were correlated: patients with more severe symptoms had lower BOLD signal changes in the right mid-DLPFC. For ERP, a group x task interaction was observed for N350 amplitude. A larger amplitude for the working memory task than for the control task was found in control subjects, but not in MTBI subjects, who had weak amplitudes for both tasks. This study confirms that persistent symptoms after MTBI cannot be uniquely explained by psychological factors, such as depression and/or malingering, and indicates that they can be associated with cerebral dysfunction. ERP reveals decreased amplitude of the N350 component, while fMRI demonstrates that the more severe the symptoms, the lower the BOLD signal changes in the mid-DLPFC.

For this purpose, an ANN model utilizing the feed-forward back-propagation algorithm as a learning rule is developed. The inputs to the neural network are the flight operational time and the number of landings as independent variables and the output is the failure rate of the tires. Two years of data are used for failure rate prediction model and validation. Model validation, which reflects the suitability of the model for future predictions, is performed by comparing the predictions of the model with that of Weibull regression model. The results show that the failure rate predicted by the ANN is closer in agreement with the actual data than the failure rate predicted by the Weibull model. The present work also identifies some of the common tire failures and presents representative results based on the established model for the most frequently occurring tire failure.

Methods: Retrospective study of all intracranial EEG studies that included insular electrodes from 2004-2010. Patients were divided according to the implantation scheme. The first method (type 1) consisted of a craniotomy, insertion of insular electrodes after microdissection of the sylvian fissure, orthogonal implantation of mesiotemporal structures with neuronavigation, and coverage of the adjacent lobes with subdural electrodes. The second method (type 2) consisted of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-stereotactic frame-guided depth electrode implantation into insula and hippocampus using sagittal axes, and insertion of subdural electrodes through burr holes to cover the adjacent lobes. The combined implantations were developed and performed by one neurosurgeon (AB). Key Findings: Nineteen patients had an intracranial study that sampled the insula, among other regions. Sixteen patients were implanted using the first method, which allowed a mean of 4, 5, 20, 15, and 42 contacts per patient to be positioned into/over the insular, mesial temporal, neocortical temporal, parietal, and frontal areas, respectively. The second method (three patients) allowed a mean of 8, 7, 16, 6, and 9 contacts per patient to sample the same areas, respectively. The four patients in whom transient neurologic deficits occurred were investigated with use of type 1 implantation. Significance: Combined depth and subdural electrodes can be used safely to investigate complex insular/perisylvian refractory epilepsy. Choice of implantation scheme should be individualized according to presurgical data and the need for functional localization.

Methods: Ninety-three women aged 18-29 participated in the study and were categorized by SCL-90-R depression score into low-mood (n=21) and normal-mood (n=72) groups. All subjects were below the threshold for possible clinical depression. Results: Low mood was associated with decreased tactile sensitivity, reduced response to topical capsaicin, and increased complaints of back, joint, muscle, and visceral pain, but not headache, when compared to normal mood controls. Low mood was also associated with reported poorer health and physical functioning, increased psychopathology, and family history of mood problems. Conclusion: These data show that even subclinical low mood is associated with marked alterations in health and psychophysiological function. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Temperature-dependent Hoffman degradation of cisatracurium may allow reduction in infusion rate (IR) during hypothermia. The effect of hypothermic CPB on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of cisatracurium has not been described in children. Methods and materials: Using neuromuscular monitoring with a Datex Relaxograph, cisatracurium IR was adjusted to obtain a pseudo-steady state during each phase of surgery (pre-CPB, CPB, post-CPB). Paired samples were taken at each phase. Cisatracurium plasma concentrations (Cpss) were determined by HPLC. Core and skin temperatures were recorded. Results: Data from ten infants were analyzed: Group 1: mean 33.6 degrees C; Group 2: mean 21.9 degrees C. To maintain T1% between 5% and 10% in Group 2, the IR was decreased by a mean of 89% (P < 0.001). IR was not significantly different in Group 1. Post-CPB IR approximated pre-CPB rates in both groups. During CPB, Cpss fell by 27% in Group 1 and by 50% in Group 2 (P - 0.039). Post-CPB Cpss was not significantly different to pre-CPB in either group. Clearance did not change significantly in Group 1 but fell significantly in Group 2 during CPB (P = 0.002). Clearance post-CPB was unchanged from pre-CPB. Conclusions: Cisatracurium IR may be decreased by around 60% during CPB with moderate hypothermia but can be maintained at baseline during mild hypothermia.

The results show that dissonance induces more unpleasant feelings and stronger physiological responses in HE than in LE participants, suggesting that musical education reinforces aversion to dissonance. Skin conductance (SCR) and electromyographic (EMG) signals were analyzed according to a defense cascade model, which takes into account two successive time windows corresponding to orienting and defense responses. These analyses suggest that musical experience can influence the defense response to dissonance and demonstrate a powerful role of musical experience not only in autonomic but also in expressive responses to music.

One possible underlying mechanism linking the vagus nerve and disorders is the HPA axis. Thirty-three healthy male subjects participated in a stress task, while heart rate (HR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), salivary cortisol, and mood were assessed. Vagal function was determined using baseline, stress-induced inhibition, and Cold Face Test (CFT)-induced stimulation. The stress task induced a significant increase in cortisol and HR, a decrease in RSA, and a worsening of mood. A linear regression model with the time from CFT onset until maximum bradycardia as the independent variable explained 17.9% of the total variance in cortisol in response to the stressor (mood: 36.5%). The results indicate that a faster CFT response is associated with reduced cortisol increase and enhanced mood after acute stress. Our data support an inverse relationship between vagal function and the HPA axis.

Although the proponents of the two models maintain largely independent lines of research, operant and neurobiological interpretations of stereotypy are not mutually exclusive. The paper reviews the two models of stereotypy and proposes an integrated model using recent findings on the neurobiology of reinforcement. The dopaminergic system and the basal ganglia are both involved in stereotypy and in reinforcement, which provides a potential link between the models. Implications of the integrated model for future research are discussed in terms of improving the assessment and treatment of stereotypy in individuals with developmental disabilities.

First published December 24, 2010; doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.00410.2010.-Severe dyslipidemia and the associated oxidative stress could accelerate the age-related decline in cerebrovascular endothelial function and cerebral blood flow (CBF), leading to neuronal loss and impaired learning abilities. We hypothesized that a chronic treatment with the polyphenol catechin would prevent endothelial dysfunction, maintain CBF responses, and protect learning abilities in atherosclerotic (ATX) mice. We treated ATX (C57Bl/6-LDLR(-/-) hApoB(+/+); 3 mo old) mice with catechin (30 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1)) for 3 mo, and C57Bl/6 [wild type (WT), 3 and 6 mo old] mice were used as controls. ACh- and flow-mediated dilations (FMD) were recorded in pressurized cerebral arteries. Basal CBF and increases in CBF induced by whisker stimulation were measured by optical coherence tomography and Doppler, respectively. Learning capacities were evaluated with the Morris water maze test. Compared with 6-mo-old WT mice, cerebral arteries from 6-mo-old ATX mice displayed a higher myogenic tone, lower responses to ACh and FMD, and were insensitive to NOS inhibition (P < 0.05), suggesting endothelial dysfunction. Basal and increases in CBF were lower in 6-mo-old ATX than WT mice (P < 0.05). A decline in the learning capabilities was also observed in ATX mice (P < 0.05). Catechin 1) reduced cerebral superoxide staining (P < 0.05) in ATX mice, 2) restored endothelial function by reducing myogenic tone, improving ACh- and FMD and restoring the sensitivity to nitric oxide synthase inhibition (P < 0.05), 3) increased the changes in CBF during stimulation but not basal CBF, and 4) prevented the decline in learning abilities (P < 0.05). In conclusion, catechin treatment of ATX mice prevents cerebrovascular dysfunctions and the associated decline in learning capacities.

They are characterized by differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of DNA that confer parent of origin-specific transcription. We developed a new strategy to identify imprinted gene-associated DMRs. Using genome-wide methylation profiling of sodium bisulfite modified DNA from normal human tissues of biparental origin, candidate DMRs were identified by selecting CpGs with methylation levels consistent with putative allelic differential methylation. In parallel, the methylation profiles of tissues of uniparental origin, i.e., paternally-derived androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles (AnCHMs), and maternally-derived mature cystic ovarian teratoma (MCT), were examined and then used to identify CpGs with parent of origin-specific DNA methylation. With this approach, we found known DMRs associated with imprinted genomic regions as well as new DMRs for known imprinted genes, NAP1L5 and ZNF597, and novel candidate imprinted genes. The paternally methylated DMR for one candidate, AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase, was also validated in experiments with mouse embryos that demonstrated Axl was expressed preferentially from the maternal allele in a DNA methylation-dependent manner.

J	Patten, SA; Moldovan, F				Patten, Shunmoogum A.; Moldovan, Florina			Could genetic determinants of inner ear anomalies be a factor for the development of idiopathic scoliosis?	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							CANDIDATE REGIONS; LOCUS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; IDENTIFICATION; ASSIGNMENT; MELATONIN	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a condition characterized by a three-dimensional structural deformity of the spine. It is the most common type of spine deformity occurring in children aged 10 to maturity. Although the etiology of AIS still remains unknown, the role of genetic factors in the development of idiopathic scoliosis is widely accepted. However, to date no causative genes of AIS have been identified. Recently, the semicircular canals, which are part of the inner ear, were found to be morphologically abnormal in idiopathic scoliosis patients. Here we hypothesized that genetic predisposition to inner ear anomalies in AIS patients may be a strong factor in the generation of idiopathic scoliosis. The proposed idea is that gene defects could impair the development of the semicircular canals. A malformation of semicircular canals might affect the transmission of sensory signal about rotational movement of the body to the central nervous system; leading to an alteration in the neuronal circuit of balance. This will in turn affect body posture and results in the initiation of the curvature of the spine. This hypothesis may provide new insights in the understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of idiopathic scoliosis. It can also offer hopes for potential early prediction of scoliosis.

However, physiological research has revealed that even V1 simple cells have surprising complexity. Our computational simulations explore the effect of this complexity on the visual system's ability to solve simple tasks, such as the categorization of shapes and digits, after learning from a limited number of examples. We use recently proposed high-throughput methodology to explore what axes of modeling complexity are useful in these categorization tasks. We find that complex cell rate models learn to categorize objects better than simple cell models, and without incurring extra computational expense. We find that the squaring of linear filter responses leads to better performance. We find that several other components of physiologically derived models do not yield better performance.

Canadian Pediat Demyelinating Dis	HLA-DRB1 confers increased risk of pediatric-onset MS in children with acquired demyelination	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; CLINICAL-FEATURES; ASSOCIATION; LINKAGE	Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) in the pediatric age group is being increasingly recognized. In adults, complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors contribute to risk and the major genetic component of MS susceptibility localizes to the major histocompatibility complex (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]). Whether HLA alleles predict MS in at-risk children presenting with acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) of the CNS is unknown. Methods: HLA-DRB1 alleles were typed using an allele-specific PCR amplification method on samples from 266 children presenting with ADS enrolled in the prospective Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study and from 196 healthy controls. Results: Sixty-four of 266 children with ADS met established criteria for a diagnosis of MS during a mean follow-up of 3.2 +/- 1.5 years. Children harboring DRB1*15 alleles were more likely to be diagnosed with MS (chi(2) = 12.2, p < 0.001; OR = 2.7), an observation strengthened by children of European ancestry (chi(2) = 10.5, p = 0.001; OR = 3.3). DRB1*15 allele frequencies in children with ADS of European ancestry subsequently diagnosed with MS were greater than in children with monophasic ADS (chi(2) = 10.7, p = 0.001) or healthy controls (chi(2) = 12.5, p < 0.001). The proportion of children with non-European ancestry diagnosed with MS was not influenced by DRB1*15 status. Conclusion: DRB1*15 alleles confer increased susceptibility to pediatric-onset MS, supporting a fundamental similarity in genetic contribution to MS risk in both pediatric-and adult-onset disease. The specificity of the DRB1*15 risk allele for children with subsequent MS diagnosis, but not for all children with ADS, indicates that the risk conveyed by DRB1*15 relates to chronic CNS disease (MS), rather than acquired demyelination in general.

Executive and Memory Function in Adolescents Born Very Preterm	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						very low birth weight; prematurity; executive function; memory	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; LOW-DOSE INDOMETHACIN; 29 WEEKS GESTATION; HEALTH-CARE NEEDS; CHILDREN BORN; INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGE; FOLLOW-UP; OUTCOMES; SCHOOL	BACKGROUND: Many preterm children display school difficulties, which may be mediated by impairment in executive function and memory. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate executive and memory function among adolescents born preterm compared with term controls at 16 years. METHODS: A total of 337 of 437 (77%) adolescents born in 1989 to 1992 with a birth weight < 1250 g and 102 term controls were assessed with a battery of executive function and memory tasks. Multiple regression analyses were used to compare groups and to identify associations between selected factors and outcomes among preterm subjects. RESULTS: Adolescents born preterm, compared with term controls, showed deficits in executive function in the order of 0.4 to 0.6 SD on tasks of verbal fluency, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, planning/organization, and working memory as well as verbal and visuospatial memory. After exclusion of adolescents with neurosensory disabilities and full-scale IQ < 70, significant group differences persisted on most tests. Preterm subjects, compared with term controls, were at increased risk of exhibiting problems related to executive dysfunction, as measured with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, on the Metacognition Index (odds ratio [OR]: 2.5 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-5.1]) and the Global Executive Composite (OR: 4.2 [95% CI: 1.6-10.9]), but not on the Behavioral Regulation index (OR: 1.5 [95% CI: 0.7-3.5]). Among adolescents born preterm, severe brain injury on neonatal ultrasound and lower maternal education were the most consistent factors associated with poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Even after exclusion of preterm subjects with significant disabilities, adolescents born preterm in the early 1990s were at increased risk of deficits in executive function and memory.

Mourlon, L Naudon, B. Giros, M. Crumeyrolle-Arias and V. Dauge. Early stress leads to effects on estrous cycle and differential responses to stress. Physiol Behav-Women are more susceptible than men to stress-related mental disorders. However, few animal studies have been conducted on females. Given the interactions between gonadic hormones and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, we hypothesized that the effects of early stress may be different between males and females depending on the state of their estrous cycle. Using adult Long-Evans rats of both genders, the effects of maternal deprivation were investigated on the estrous cycle length. corticosterone levels after food deprivation or restraint stress procedures, and the negative feedback efficiency of dexamethasone on the HPA axis. The individual length of the estrous cycle was evaluated using vaginal smears. Non-deprived (AFR) females mainly exhibited regular 5-day cycles (40% of the population) and 4-5-day cycles (26%), with fewer 4-day cycles (18%) and irregular cycles (16%). Comparatively, deprived (D) females displayed a significant decrease of 5-day cycles (24%) and a significant increase of irregular cycles (28%). After the restraint stress procedure, D females exhibited higher corticosterone level than AFR females during proestrous. After the food deprivation procedure. D and AFR females maintained dose-response sensitivity to the negative feedback induced by dexamethasone but only during proestrous. No differences were observed between D and AFR males under these experimental conditions. These data highlight the importance of early environmental factors in regulating the spontaneous pattern of the estrous cycle as well as gender- and stressor-dependent sensitivity of the HPA axis according to steroid levels.

Design: Following 6 nights of actigraphic monitoring of sleep to determine baseline sleep duration, children were asked to restrict sleep duration by 1 hour for 6 consecutive nights. NBF was assessed at baseline (Day 6) and following sleep manipulation (Day 12). Setting: A quiet location within their home environments. Participants: Forty-three children (11 ADHD, 32 Controls, mean age = 8.7 years, SD = 1.3) between the ages of 7 and 11 years. Interventions: NA Measurements: Sleep was monitored using actigraphy. In addition, parents were asked to complete nightly sleep logs. Sleepiness was evaluated using a questionnaire. The Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) was used to assess NBF. Results: Restricted sleep led to poorer CPT scores on two-thirds of CPT outcome measures in both healthy controls and children with ADHD. The performance of children with ADHD following sleep restriction deteriorated from subclinical levels to the clinical range of inattention on two-thirds of CPT outcome measures. Conclusions: Moderate sleep restriction leads to a detectable negative impact on the NBF of children with ADHD and healthy controls, leading to a clinical level of impairment in children with ADHD.

Statin therapy prior to coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) has been shown to prevent perioperative events such as myocardial infarction and perioperative death. The effect of statin therapy as a preventive treatment to decrease the stroke risk unrelated to cardiac surgery is also documented. In the setting of CABG, we have found no studies reporting a preventive effect of statin therapy on neurologic outcome. Methods. We analyzed 6,813 patients treated by CABG surgery at our institution between 1995 and 2005 for which complete medication history including all drugs taken before and after surgery was available. We analyzed the risk factors for postoperative stroke using a multiple logistic regression analysis, more specifically looking at the effect of preoperative treatment with statin, aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alone or in combination. Results. At 30 days postoperative, 94 patients suffered a new documented stroke (1.4%). Hypertension, carotid disease, diabetes, and age were all associated with a greater risk of postoperative stroke. When analyzing the four groups of drug therapy, none of the medications alone affected the stroke rate. However, upon multivariable analysis the combination of statin and beta-blockers gave an odds ratio of 0.377, suggesting a strong protective effect. Conclusions. Beta-blockers combined with statin confer a protective effect for stroke after CABG.

Also we present technical considerations for those wishing to study their own genes of interest by taking advantage of this easily manipulated and clinically relevant model organism. Zebrafish permit mutational analyses of genetic function (gain or loss of function) and the rapid validation of human variants as pathological mutations. In particular, neural degeneration can be characterized at genetic, cellular, functional, and behavioral levels. Zebrafish have been used to knock down or express mutations in zebrafish homologs of human genes and to directly express human genes bearing mutations related to neurodegenerative disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy, ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, fronto-temporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. More recently, we have been using zebrafish to validate mutations of synaptic genes discovered by large-scale genomic approaches in developmental disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and non-syndromic mental retardation. Advances in zebrafish genetics such as multigenic analyses and chemical genetics now offer a unique potential for disease research. Thus, zebrafish hold much promise for advancing the functional genomics of human diseases, the understanding of the genetics and cell biology of degenerative and developmental disorders, and the discovery of therapeutics.

At the cellular level, such functions involve EGFR overactivation and phosphorylation. In the present study, we describe that human embryonic kidney-293 cells transfected with somatostatin (SST) receptor 5 (SSTR5) exhibit inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation and modulate MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3-protein kinase/AKT cell survival signaling. Furthermore, suppression of EGFR by using small interference RNA and an antagonist (AG1478) potentiates the SST effect via activation of SSTR5 on signaling molecules. In wild-type human embryonic kidney-293 cells, EGFR/ErbB2 exists as constitutive heterodimers. The presence of SSTR5 leads to the dissociation of the heteromeric complex of EGFR/ErbB2 and display preferential heterodimerization between SSTR5 and EGFR in an agonist-dependent manner. These findings highlight a new undiscovered mechanism and potential role of SSTR5 to attenuate the EGFR mediated signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis. Our data indicate that the activation and/or overexpression of SST receptors along with the inhibition of EGFR will serve as an important therapeutic approach in the treatment of ErbB-positive tumors.

An ongoing controversy does exist, however, concerning the receptor organ through which these chemicals are processed. There is a widespread belief that the vomeronasal organ (VNO) is responsible for processing social chemosignals in humans. Here we demonstrate that functional occlusion of the VNO does not change the percept of, sensitivity toward, or functional neuronal processing of a putative human pheromone. Perithreshold and suprathreshold perception of the endogenous chemical androstadienone (AND) were compared, as were positron emission tomography brain activations evoked by AND when the VNO was either occluded or left open. In addition, we compared sensitivity to AND in subjects with an identifiable VNO to those in whom no VNO could be detected. Thus we could examine the effects of the VNO at several different levels of processing. Occlusion or absence of the VNO did not affect either the perceptual measurements or the functional processing of the putative human pheromone, AND. These results provide strong evidence that the human VNO has no obvious function. Pheromonal communication in humans may be conveyed via the main olfactory system. Hum Brain Mapp 32:450-460, 2011.

Normotension in Lewis and Dahl salt-resistant rats is governed by different genes	JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION			English	Article						genetics of hypertension and normotension; Nxph4; Rdh2; Tac2	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; BLOOD-PRESSURE QTL; POSITIONAL CLONING; HUMAN HYPERTENSION; CONGENIC STRAINS; CHROMOSOME-7; ALDOSTERONE; MUTATIONS; BIOLOGY	Objectives Inbred rodent models simulating essential hypertension and normotension are useful tools in discovering genes controlling blood pressure (BP) homeostasis. An analysis of a F(2) population made from crosses of hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) and normotensive Lewis rats did not detect a BP quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 (Chr 7). However, false negativity could not be excluded. If a BPQTL could be proven to exist, what gene(s) may be responsible for this QTL. Methods We first constructed reciprocal congenic strains for a Chr 7 segment and determined functional domains of prominent candidate genes. Results A congenic strain made in the DSS rat background exhibited a BP effect, indicating that a BP QTL, C7QTL, inhabits Chr 7. Contrarily, a congenic strain constructed in the Lewis rat background did not change BP, demonstrating a dependence of C7QTL on the DSS rats environment. Among the candidate genes, tachykinin 2 (Tac2), neurexophilin 4 (Nxph4) and retinol dehydrogenase 2 (Rdh2) bear nonsynonymous changes comparing DSS and Lewis rats, but are the same comparing DSS and Dahl salt-resistant (DSR) rats. In contrast, the Lewis alleles of 11-beta-hydroxylase (Cyp11b1), aldosterone synthase (Cyp11b2) and Cytochrome P-450 11B3 (Cyp11b3) are identical to those of DSS rats, but different from those of DSR rats. Conclusion Thus, the failure to detect a linkage between a Chr 7 segment and BP in F(2)(DSS x Lewis) can be attributed to false negativity. Tac2, Nxph4 and Rdh2 are priority candidate genes for C7QTL. Lewis and DSR rats are both normotensive, but their underlying genetic determinants are different.

The effect of different doses of the mGLUR5 antagonist, MPEP (0, 1, 3 and 9mg/kg, i.p.), was assessed on reward induced by electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus, and on the enhancement of reward by amphetamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) in adult male Long Evans rats. The effect of a single dose of MPEP (0 and 9mg/kg) on amphetamine-induced increase in locomotor activity was also assessed. Systemic injection of MPEP alone did not alter reward threshold and maximum rate of responding. Amphetamine produced a 25-30% decrease in reward threshold, an effect not altered by the highest dose of MPEP. At this dose, MPEP produced a weak inhibition of spontaneous locomotion and a significant attenuation of the enhanced locomotor activity induced by amphetamine. These findings show that mGLUR5 glutamate receptors are unlikely to constitute important elements of the reward-relevant pathway, and do not intervene in the enhancement effect of amphetamine. They also show, however, that these glutamate receptors play a key role in amphetamine-induced increased locomotor activity, providing additional evidence for a dissociation between the substrates that mediate these two behaviours.

Back muscle surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded in healthy males during anteriorly-directed sudden loading perturbations applied to the trunk. Measures of EMG reflex latency and amplitude were obtained. The generalizability theory was used as a framework to estimate the magnitude of the different variance components and the reliability of the measures corresponding to various simulations of different measurement strategies. Reliability of the different variables was poor to moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient range 0-0.62). Averaging scores across homologous muscles and several trials were strategies to achieve more acceptable reliability. The reflex response of back muscles is inherently variable, and a large measurement effort is necessary to obtain reliable and, consequently, valid and responsive estimations of this neuromuscular function.

While moderate-to-high levels of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have repeatedly been associated with long-term neurodevelopmental deficits, no consensus has yet been reached on the detrimental effects of low-to-moderate PAE on the children's functioning, including the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The study aims to examine the association between low PAE and cortisol response to unfamiliar situations in 19-month-old children and to determine whether this association was moderated by sex and testosterone levels. Information regarding PAE, cortisol response to unfamiliar situations, and testosterone activity was available in a total of 130 children participating to the Qu,bec Newborn Twin Study (Montr,al, QC, Canada). Mother alcohol consumption during pregnancy was assessed via a semistructured interview conducted when the children were 6 months of age. The contribution of prenatal and postnatal confounds were examined. Disrupted patterns of cortisol activity were observed only in PAE males. Testosterone tended to be negatively associated with the cortisol response, but not for PAE males, suggesting an altered sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of testosterone in these participants. Low levels of PAE were associated with disrupted cortisol activity, and males may be at higher risk. These findings challenge the existence of a "safe level" of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and have public health implications.

This study examined the effects of PV isolation (PVI) vs. peri-PV ganglionic plexus ablation (GPA) in two discrete canine AF models: ventricular tachypacing (240 bpm, 2 weeks)-induced congestive heart failure (CHF), and atrial tachypacing (400 bpm, 1 week)-induced atrial tachycardia remodeling (ATR). Methods and results All PVs were isolated with an epicardial radiofrequency clamp in nine CHF and eight ATR dogs. Peri-PV ganglionic plexi (identified by bradycardic responses to high-frequency stimulation) were ablated in six CHF and five ATR dogs with an epicardial radiofrequency-ablation pen. Electrophysiologic measurements, including 240-electrode AF mapping, were obtained and dominant frequencies (DFs) determined. Atrial growth associated protein-43 (GAP43) and neurofilament-M (NF-M) expression were determined immunohistologically. In CHF, neither PVI nor GPA affected AF duration, DF or the already low AF vulnerability. In ATR, PVI reduced AF vulnerability (75 +/- 6% to 55 +/- 11%, P < 0.05) but did not alter AF duration or DF. In contrast, GPA prolonged atrial refractory period and decreased AF vulnerability (75 +/- 8 to 30 +/- 10%, P, 0.05), AF duration (617 +/- 246 to 39 +/- 23 s, ** P < 0.01), and DF (11.4 +/- 0.6 to 8.6 +/- 0.3** Hz, left atrium) in ATR dogs. Both GAP-43 and NF-M expression were decreased in CHF (by 63.1** and 60.0%**) and increased in ATR (by 65.5** and 92.1%, P < 0.001) compared with control. Conclusions PVs play a minor role in experimental AF due to CHF or ATR, but autonomic ganglia are important in AF related to ATR. Differential neural remodelling may contribute to varying effects of GPA in discrete AF substrates.

This multicenter trial evaluated pregabalin in a broader range of neuropathic pain etiologies. Methods: In this enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial, 256 patients received single blind, flexible dose pregabalin for 4 weeks; stable concomitant analgesics were allowed. One hundred sixty-five (65%) had a >= 30% pain improvement and 157 were randomized and treated, double blind, to either continue pregabalin (n = 80) or to receive placebo (n = 77) for 5 weeks. Results: Of the single blind responders randomized, 81% on placebo and 86% on pregabalin completed the double-blind phase. At the double-blind endpoint, mean (SD) pain scores were 2.9 (1.9) in the pregabalin group and 3.5 (1.7) in the placebo group (P = 0.002). These modest yet significant pregabalin-placebo differences were observed within each of the subgroups of patients with a diagnosis of either DPN or PHN (P = 0.03), and with other, diagnoses (P = 0.02). Significant differences were also observed in sleep interference, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety and Depression subscales, and other secondary measures. In total, 28 out of 80 (35.0%) in the pregabalin group and 28 out of 77 (36.4%) in the placebo group had either a meaningful increase in pain or discontinued the double-blind phase. Adverse events were consistent with the known tolerability profile of pregabalin and led to discontinuation of 9 during the single-blind phase, and 5 and 2 patients from the placebo and pregabalin groups, respectively. Discussion: These results support previous evidence of pregabalin efficacy but further demonstrate efficacy and tolerability in a broader range of peripheral neuropathic pain conditions beyond just DPN and PHN.

However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we used field potential recordings from the lateral entorhinal cortex in horizontal rat brain slices to explore whether two different K(+) currents regulated by muscarinic receptor activation, the inward rectifier (K(IR)) and the M-type (K(M)) currents, have a role in carbachol (CCh)-induced field activity, a prototypical model of cholinergic-dependent epileptiform synchronization. To establish whether K(IR) or K(M) blockade could replicate CCh effects, we exposed slices to blockers of these currents in the absence of CCh. K(IR) channel blockade with micromolar Ba(2+) concentrations induced interictal-like events with duration and frequency that were lower than those observed with CCh; by contrast, the K(M) blocker linopirdine was ineffective. Pre-treatment with Ba(2+) or linopirdine increased the duration of epileptiform discharges induced by subsequent application of CCh. Baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor agonist that activates K(IR), abolished CCh-induced field oscillations, an effect that was abrogated by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP 55845, and prevented by Ba(2+). Finally, when applied after CCh, the K(M) activators flupirtine and retigabine shifted leftward the cumulative distribution of CCh-induced event duration; this effect was opposite to what seen during linopirdine application under similar experimental conditions. Overall, our findings suggest that K(IR) rather than K(M) plays a major regulatory role in controlling CCh-induced epileptiform synchronization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Epidural hemangiomas are rare lesions, and most reported cases are cavernous. We report a case of a capillary hemangioma in the thoracic epidural space. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The 57-year-old male patient initially presented with low thoracic spine pain. A magnetic resonance image of the thoracolumbar spine demonstrated an avidly enhancing epidural mass lesion in the lower thoracic spine with extension into the adjacent foramina at 2 levels on the right side. The patient developed progressive myelopathy over the course of 2.5 years despite minimal radiological changes. Surgical treatment resulted in good recovery. Histopathologically, the lesion corresponded to a vascular tumor composed of vessels of various calibers with fibrous septa between them. CONCLUSION: Early treatment of this type of lesion should be advocated to prevent deterioration and permanent neurological deficits. Appropriate treatment appears to be gross total resection.

J	Major, P				Major, Philippe			Potential of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas in tuberous sclerosis complex	AGING-US			English	Article						Rapamycin; mTOR; tuberous sclerosis complex; subependymal giant cell astrocytoma	RAPAMYCIN; SIROLIMUS	Rapamycin inhibits the mTOR (target of rapamycin) pathway and extends lifespan in multiple species. The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein is a negative regulator of mTOR. In humans, loss of the TSC protein results in a disorder characterized clinically by the growth of benign tumors in multiple organs, due to overactivation of mTOR inhibition. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are benign brain tumors associated with TSC that have traditionally been treated by surgery, but for which mTOR inhibitors have recently been suggested as potential alternative treatments. The duration of mTOR treatment for SEGAs might have to be prolonged, probably lifelong, because SEGAs usually grow back after treatment is stopped. This cohort of patients who will experience prolonged exposure to mTOR inhibitors should be carefully followed longitudinally to better document long term side effects, but also to compare their longevity with the one of similar patients with TSC. These patients represent a unique opportunity to study the potential anti-aging properties of mTOR inhibitors in humans.

Due to the diffusive nature of photon propagation in turbid media and the fact that cerebral tissues are located around 1.5 cm under the adult human scalp, DOI measurements are subject to partial volume errors. DOI measurements are also sensitive to large pial vessels because oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin are the dominant chromophores in the near infrared window. In this study, the effect of the extra-cerebral vasculature in proximity of the sagittal sinus was investigated for its impact on DOI measurements simulated over the human adult visual cortex. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two specific models of the human head derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The first model included the extra-cerebral vasculature in which constant hemoglobin concentrations were assumed while the second did not. The screening effect of the vasculature was quantified by comparing recovered hemoglobin changes from each model for different optical arrays and regions of activation. A correction factor accounting for the difference between the recovered and the simulated hemoglobin changes was computed in each case. The results show that changes in hemoglobin concentration are better estimated when the extra-cerebral vasculature is modeled and the correction factors obtained in this case were at least 1.4-fold lower. The effect of the vasculature was also examined in a high-density diffuse optical tomography configuration. In this case, the difference between changes in hemoglobin concentration recovered with each model was reduced down to 10%.

Refractory dyspnea is a common and difficult symptom to treat in patients with advanced COPD. There are many questions concerning optimal management and, specifically, whether various therapies are effective in this setting. The present document was compiled to address these important clinical issues using an evidence-based systematic review process led by a representative interprofessional panel of experts. The evidence supports the benefits of oral opioids, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, chest wall vibration, walking aids and pursed-lip breathing in the management of dyspnea in the individual patient with advanced COPD. Oxygen is recommended for COPD patients with resting hypoxemia, but its use for the targeted management of dyspnea in this setting should be reserved for patients who receive symptomatic benefit. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of anxiolytic medications, nebulized opioids, acupuncture, acupressure, distractive auditory stimuli (music), relaxation, hand-held fans, counselling programs or psychotherapy. There is also no evidence to support the use of supplemental oxygen to reduce dyspnea in nonhypoxemic patients with advanced COPD. Recognizing the current unfamiliarity with prescribing and dosing of opioid therapy in this setting, a potential approach for their use is illustrated. The role of opioid and other effective therapies in the comprehensive management of refractory dyspnea in patients with advanced COPD is discussed.

The current gold standard for NMO-IgG identification is indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Our aim in this study was to develop a new quantitative cell-based assay (CBA) and to propose a rational strategy for anti-AQP4 Ab identification and quantification. We observed an excellent correlation between the CBA and IIF for NMO-IgG/anti-AQP4 detection. The CBA appeared more sensitive than IIF but on the other hand, IIF allows the simultaneous detection of various auto-Abs, underlining the complementarity between both methods. In conclusion, we propose to use IIF for the screening of patients at diagnosis in order to identify auto-Abs targeting the central nervous system. A highly sensitive, AQP4 specific and quantitative assay such as our CBA could be used thereafter to specifically identify the target of the Ab and to monitor its serum concentration under treatment.

Recently, other imaging tests have emerged in heart failure management: cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT). This article reviews recent developments in heart failure imaging. Recent findings Longitudinal left ventricular systolic strain on ECHO speckle tracking imaging detects subclinical cardiomyopathy and predicts survival in symptomatic heart failure. Late gadolinium enhancement for myocardial scar is an independent predictor of death or transplantation in ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. In contrast to earlier reports, both ECHO and CMR contrast have a negligible risk of adverse outcomes. Stress perfusion imaging (SPECT or PET) and PET flow quantification have prognostic value in ischemic cardiomyopathy. F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET directed management can impact outcome. Abnormal myocardial neuronal activity on I-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging is associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and death. Cardiac CT potentially could assess heart failure etiology through coronary angiography and myocardial tissue characterization but its precise role remains undetermined. Summary There have been several exciting developments in all imaging modalities. Large multicenter trials such as IMAGE heart failure are required to standardize measures and establish benefit before widespread use in heart failure can be recommended.

Although GSWDs are the result of highly synchronized activity in the thalamocortical network, EEG without GSWDs is believed to represent normal brain activity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether thalamocortical interactions are altered even during GSWD-free EEG periods in patients with IGE. Methods: A GSWD-related group analysis was performed in 12 IGE patients to define seeds in areas involved during GSWDs. EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets from 22 IGE patients without GSWDs during the investigation and 30 age-matched healthy controls were then selected to investigate functional connectivity in GSWD-related areas. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes were extracted from seeds defined by the GSWD-related group analysis. The averaged time course within each seed was used to detect brain regions with BOLD signal correlated with the seed. Group differences between patients and controls were estimated. Key Findings: The GSWD-related group analysis showed BOLD activation in the thalamus, the frontomesial cortex, and the cerebellum and BOLD deactivation in default mode areas. For the connectivity analysis, eight seeds were placed bilaterally in the thalamus, mesial frontal cortex, precuneus, and cerebellum. The functional connectivity analysis of these seeds did not show clearly altered functional connectivity for patients versus controls. Significance: The results underscore the paroxysmal nature of GSWDs: Although GSWDs are characterized by highly synchronized activity in the thalamocortical network, the functional connectivity in areas involved during GSWDs does not demonstrate abnormality in GSWD-free periods.

J	Devlin, JW; Skrobik, Y				Devlin, John W.; Skrobik, Yoanna			Antipsychotics for the Prevention and Treatment of Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit: What Is Their Role?	HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						antipsychotics; delirium; critical care; drug therapy; haloperidol; intensive care unit; olanzapine; prevention; quetiapine; treatment; ziprasidone	CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS; ACUTE BRAIN-DYSFUNCTION; ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM; SUBSYNDROMAL DELIRIUM; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; INTRAVENOUS-HALOPERIDOL; RISK-FACTORS; DOUBLE-BLIND	Delirium affects up to 80%% of critically ill patients, worsens outcomes, and is frequently treated with antipsychotics despite uncertainty regarding their efficacy and safety. We identified published, English-language, randomized, controlled studies evaluating antipsychotics in ICU patients either with delirium or at risk for developing delirium. In 105 mechanically ventilated patients, the number of days spent alive without delirium or coma was similar between haloperidol (median, 14.0 days; interquartile range [[IQR]], 6.0--18.0 days) or ziprasidone (median, 15.0 days; IQR, 9.1--18.0 days) prophylaxis, and placebo (median, 12.5 days; IQR, 1.2--17.2 days) groups (p == 0.66). Treating delirium with quetiapine, compared to placebo, in 36 ICU patients was associated with a quicker resolution of delirium (median for quetiapine, 1.0 days; IQR, 0.5--3.0 days/median for placebo, 4.5 days; IQR, 2.0--7.0 days [[p == 0.001]]). In a third study, a similar decrease over time in delirium severity was noted between fixed-dose oral olanzapine and oral haloperidol in patients with delirium. None of the studies identified serious safety concerns with administering the antipsychotics that were studied. Published prospective, randomized clinical trials evaluating antipsychotic therapy for preventing or treating delirium in the ICU are few in number. The conclusions that can be drawn from them are limited by their heterogeneity, inconsistency in incorporating non-antipsychotic strategies known to reduce delirium or in maintaining patients in an arousable state, their size, the lack of ICU and non-ICU clinical outcomes evaluated, and the lack of placebo arms. A research framework for future evaluation of the use of antipsychotic therapy in the critically ill is proposed.</.

Energy storage system scheduling for an isolated microgrid	IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; HEAT-PUMP SYSTEM; RENEWABLE ENERGY; WIND POWER; OPTIMIZATION; OPERATION	A knowledge-based expert system (KBES) is proposed for the scheduling of an energy storage system (ESS) installed in a wind-diesel isolated power system. The program optimises the cost of operation by determining the diesel generation and the charging/discharging cycles of the storage system from the wind and load profiles one hour in advance. The rules created aim to minimise the use of the dump load normally associated with diesel operation. The results are compared to an offline optimisation algorithm applied to the same power system and ESS size that has a 24-h lookahead. The results obtained show that by minimising the energy wasted through the dump load with the use of the ESS and KBES controller, the required diesel generation is reduced, therefore reducing operation costs and emissions.

LRPPRC mutations cause a phenotypically distinct form of Leigh syndrome with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS			English	Article							COX DEFICIENCY; GENE; DISEASE; SURF1; SCO2	Background The natural history of all known patients with French-Canadian Leigh disease (Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, MIM220111, SLSJ-COX), the largest known cohort of patients with a genetically homogeneous, nuclear encoded congenital lactic acidosis, was studied. Results 55 of 56 patients were homozygous for the A354V mutation in LRPPRC. One was a genetic compound (A354V/C1277Xdel8). Clinical features included developmental delay, failure to thrive, characteristic facial appearance and, in 90% of patients, acute crises that have not previously been detailed, either metabolic (fulminant lactic acidosis) and/or neurological (Leigh syndrome and/or stroke-like episodes). Survival ranged from 5 days to >30 years. 46/56 patients (82%) died, at a median age of 1.6 years. Of 73 crises, 38 (52%) were fatal. The immediate causes of death were multiple organ failure and/or Leigh disease. Major predictors of mortality during crises (p<0.005) were hyperglycaemia, hepatic cytolysis, and altered consciousness at admission. Compared to a group of SURF1-deficient Leigh syndrome patients assembled from the literature, SLSJ-COX is distinct by the occurrence of metabolic crises, leading to earlier and higher mortality (p=0.001). Conclusion SLSJ-COX is clinically distinct, with acute fatal acidotic crises on a backdrop of chronic moderate developmental delay and hyperlactataemia. Leigh syndrome is common. Stroke-like episodes can occur. The Leigh syndrome of SLSJ-COX differs from that of SURF1-related COX deficiency. SLSJ-COX has a different spectrum of associated abnormalities, acidotic crises being particularly suggestive of LRPPRC related Leigh syndrome. Even among A354V homozygotes, pronounced differences in survival and severity occur, showing that other genetic and/or environmental factors can influence outcome.

First published January 5, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00792.2010.-Although serotonergic innervation of sensory brain areas is ubiquitous, its effects on sensory information processing remain poorly understood. We investigated these effects in pyramidal neurons within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) of weakly electric fish. Surprisingly, we found that 5-HT is present at different levels across the different ELL maps; the presence of 5-HT fibers was highest in the map that processes intraspecies communication signals. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that 5-HT increased excitability and burst firing through a decreased medium afterhyperpolarization resulting from reduced small-conductance calcium-activated (SK) currents as well as currents mediated by an M-type potassium channel. We next investigated how 5-HT alters responses to sensory input. 5-HT application decreased the rheobase current, increased the gain, and decreased first spike latency. Moreover, it reduced discriminability between different stimuli, as quantified by the mutual information rate. We hypothesized that 5-HT shifts pyramidal neurons into a burst-firing mode where bursts, when considered as events, can detect the presence of particular stimulus features. We verified this hypothesis using signal detection theory. Our results indeed show that serotonin-induced bursts of action potentials, when considered as events, could detect specific stimulus features that were distinct from those detected by isolated spikes. Moreover, we show the novel result that isolated spikes transmit more information after 5-HT application. Our results suggest a novel function for 5-HT in that it enables differential processing by action potential patterns in response to current injection.

PolyQ length determines disease onset and severity, with a longer expansion causing earlier onset. The mechanisms of mutant huntingtin-mediated neurotoxicity remain unclear; however, mitochondrial dysfunction is a key event in Huntington's disease pathogenesis(1,2). Here we tested whether mutant huntingtin impairs the mitochondrial fission-fusion balance and thereby causes neuronal injury. We show that mutant huntingtin triggers mitochondrial fragmentation in rat neurons and fibroblasts of individuals with Huntington's disease in vitro and in a mouse model of Huntington's disease in vivo before the presence of neurological deficits and huntingtin aggregates. Mutant huntingtin abnormally interacts with the mitochondrial fission GTPase dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1) in mice and humans with Huntington's disease, which, in turn, stimulates its enzymatic activity. Mutant huntingtin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation, defects in anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial transport and neuronal cell death are all rescued by reducing DRP1 GTPase activity with the dominant-negative DRP1 K38A mutant. Thus, DRP1 might represent a new therapeutic target to combat neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease.

Canadian Pediat Demyelinating Dis	Mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and mutations in children with acquired central demyelination	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HEREDITARY OPTIC NEUROPATHY; CHILDHOOD MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; COMPLEX-I; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; MTDNA MUTATIONS; POINT MUTATION; DISEASE; GENE; NEURITIS; RISK	Objective: We investigated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants in children with a first episode of acquired demyelinating syndromes (PD-ADS) of the CNS and their relationship to disease phenotype, including subsequent diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: This exploratory analysis included the initial 213 children with PD-ADS in the prospective Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Study and 166 matched healthy sibling controls from the Canadian Autism Genome Project. A total of 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed, including haplogroup-defining SNPs and mtDNA variants previously reported to be associated with MS. Results: Primary Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) mutations and other known pathogenic mtDNA mutations were absent in both patients with pediatric acquired demyelinating syndromes and controls. The 13708A haplogroup J-associated variant, previously linked to adult MS, was more frequent among subjects with PD-ADS (13.0%) compared to controls (6.2%; odds ratio [OR] 2.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 4.83) and haplogroup M was associated with an earlier age at onset of PD-ADS (-1.74 years; 95% CI -3.33 to -0.07). In contrast, the haplogroup cluster UKJT, as well as 3 other SNPs, were each associated with a lower risk of PD-ADS. A total of 33 subjects with PD-ADS were diagnosed with MS during a mean follow-up period of 3.11 +/- 1.14 (SD) years. No single SNP was associated with the risk of subsequent diagnosis of MS. However, haplogroup H was associated with an increased risk of MS (OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.21 to 5.55). Conclusion: These data suggest an association between mtDNA variants and the risk of PD-ADS and of a subsequent MS diagnosis. Replication of these findings in an independent population of subjects with PD-ADS is required. Neurology (R) 2011;76:774-780	[Zheng, K.; Sacchetti, M.; Simon, D.

Mice lacking the faah gene (FAAH(-/-)) show higher anandamide levels. However, their emotional phenotype is still debated and their brain serotonergic tone remained unexplored. In this study, we tested FAAH(-/-) mice in the social interaction and the open field tests performed under different lighting conditions (dim and bright) since variations of the experimental context were proposed to explain opposite findings. Moreover, by microdialysis performed under dim light, we analyzed their serotonergic transmission in frontal cortex (FC) and ventral hippocampus (vHIPP). In both light conditions, FAAH(-/-) mice showed reduced emotionality, compared to wt controls, as suggested by the increased rearing and reduced thigmotaxis displayed in the open field and by the longer time spent in social interaction. Basal serotonergic tone was higher in the FC of mutant mice as compared to control mice, while no difference was observed in the vHIPP. K(+)-induced depolarization produced similar increases of serotonin in both areas of both genotypes. An acute treatment with the CB1 antagonist rimonabant completely abolished the emotional phenotype of FAAH(-/-) mice and prevented the K(+)-stimulated release of serotonin in their FC and vHIPP, without producing any effect in wt mice. Our results support the role of FAAH in the regulation of emotional reactivity and suggest that anandamide-mediated hyperactivation of CB1 is responsible for the emotional phenotype of FAAH(-/-) mice and for their enhanced serotonergic tone.

Options include antithrombotic treatment with warfarin or antiplatelet agents or surgical or endovascular closure of the PFO. The PC-Trial was set up to compare endovascular closure and best medical treatment for prevention of recurrent events. Methods: The PC-Trial is a randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of percutaneous closure of the PFO using the Amplatzer PFO occluder with best medical treatment in patients with cryptogenic embolism, i.e. mostly cryptogenic stroke. Warfarin for 6 months followed by antiplatelet agents is recommended as medical treatment. Randomization is stratified according to patients age (< 45 versus >= 45 years), presence of atrial septal aneurysm (ASA yes or no) and number of embolic events before randomization (one versus more than one event). Primary endpoints are death, nonfatal stroke and peripheral embolism. Discussion: patients were randomized in 29 centers of Europe, Canada, and Australia. Randomization started February 2000. Enrollment of 414 patients was completed in February 2009. All patients will be followed-up longitudinally. Follow-up is maintained until the last enrolled patient is beyond 2.5 years of follow-up (expected in 2011).

We describe an auditory illusion in which a continuous ongoing tone becomes inaudible during a brief, non-masking noise burst more than one octave away, which is unexpected given the frequency resolution of human hearing. Participants strongly susceptible to this illusory discontinuity did not perceive illusory auditory continuity (in which a sound subjectively continues during a burst of masking noise) when the noises were short, yet did so at longer noise durations. Participants who were not prone to illusory discontinuity showed robust early electroencephalographic responses at 40-66 ms after noise burst onset, whereas those prone to the illusion lacked these early responses. These data suggest that short-latency neural responses to auditory scene components reflect subsequent individual differences in the parsing of auditory scenes.

In the rat, these effects are reversed by cross-fostering, demonstrating that they are defined by epigenetic rather than genetic processes. However, epigenetic changes at a single gene promoter are unlikely to account for the range of outcomes and the persistent change in expression of hundreds of additional genes in adult rats in response to differences in maternal care. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examine here using high-density oligonucleotide array the state of DNA methylation, histone acetylation and gene expression in a 7 million base pair region of chromosome 18 containing the NR3C1 gene in the hippocampus of adult rats. Natural variations in maternal care are associated with coordinate epigenetic changes spanning over a hundred kilobase pairs. The adult offspring of high compared to low maternal care mothers show epigenetic changes in promoters, exons, and gene ends associated with higher transcriptional activity across many genes within the locus examined. Other genes in this region remain unchanged, indicating a clustered yet specific and patterned response. Interestingly, the chromosomal region containing the protocadherin-alpha, -beta, and -gamma (Pcdh) gene families implicated in synaptogenesis show the highest differential response to maternal care. Conclusions/Significance: The results suggest for the first time that the epigenetic response to maternal care is coordinated in clusters across broad genomic areas. The data indicate that the epigenetic response to maternal care involves not only single candidate gene promoters but includes transcriptional and intragenic sequences, as well as those residing distantly from transcription start sites. These epigenetic and transcriptional profiles constitute the first tiling microarray data set exploring the relationship between epigenetic modifications and RNA expression in both protein coding and non-coding regions across a chromosomal locus in the mammalian brain.

Parkinsonian Neurotoxin 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and alpha-Synuclein Mutations Promote Tau Protein Phosphorylation at Ser(262) and Destabilize Microtubule Cytoskeleton in Vitro	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FIBRIL FORMATION; TRANSGENIC MICE; LEWY BODIES; KINASE; GENE; MODEL	In Parkinson disease (PD) brain, a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons leads to dopamine depletion in the striatum and reduced motor function. Lewy bodies, the characteristic neuropathological lesions found in the brain of PD patients, are composed mainly of alpha-synuclein protein. Three point mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene are associated with familial PD. In addition, genome-wide association studies indicate that alpha-synuclein and Tau protein synergistically increase disease susceptibility in the human population. To determine the mechanism by which alpha-synuclein and Tau act together, we have used PD-causing neurotoxin MPTP and pathogenic alpha-synuclein mutants A30P, E46K, and A53T as models. We found that exposure of human neuroblastoma M17 cells to MPTP enhances the intracellular alpha-synuclein protein level, stimulates Tau protein phosphorylation at Ser(262), and induces apoptosis. In mouse brain, ablation of alpha-synuclein function significantly suppresses Tau phosphorylation at Ser(262). In vitro, alpha-synuclein binds to phosphorylated Ser(214) of Tau and stimulates PKA-catalyzed Tau phosphorylation at Ser(262). PD-associated alpha-synuclein mutations increase alpha-synuclein binding to Tau and stimulate Tau phosphorylation at Ser(262). In HEK-293 cells, alpha-synuclein and its all PD-associated mutants destabilize the microtubule cytoskeleton in a similar extent. In contrast, when co-expressed with Tau, these PD-associated mutants destabilize microtubules with significantly higher potency than WT. Our results demonstrate that alpha-synuclein is an in vivo regulator of Tau protein phosphorylation at Ser(262) and suggest that PD-associated risk factors such as environmental toxins and alpha-synuclein mutations promote Tau phosphorylation at Ser(262), causing microtubule instability, which leads to loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD brain.

Potassium/Chloride cotransporter 3 (KCC3) mutations are responsible for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC), which is a severe sensory and motor neuropathy. Two major splice variants, KCC3a and KCC3b, were shown to be expressed in adult mouse tissues. Although KCC3a is mainly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), its specific cellular expression patterns have not been determined. Here, we used an approach combining in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques to determine the cellular expression of KCC3 in the mouse CNS and showed that KCC3 is mainly expressed in neurons, including a subpopulation of intemeurons. Finally, we showed that some non-neuronal cells, such as radial glial-like cells in the spinal cord, also express KCC3. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simultaneous Acquisition of Multiple Auditory-Motor Transformations in Speech	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SENSORIMOTOR ADAPTATION; INTERNAL-MODELS; FORCE-FIELDS; MOVEMENT	The brain easily generates the movement that is needed in a given situation. Yet surprisingly, the results of experimental studies suggest that it is difficult to acquire more than one skill at a time. To do so, it has generally been necessary to link the required movement to arbitrary cues. In the present study, we show that speech motor learning provides an informative model for the acquisition of multiple sensorimotor skills. During training, subjects were required to repeat aloud individual words in random order while auditory feedback was altered in real-time in different ways for the different words. We found that subjects can quite readily and simultaneously modify their speech movements to correct for these different auditory transformations. This multiple learning occurs effortlessly without explicit cues and without any apparent awareness of the perturbation. The ability to simultaneously learn several different auditory-motor transformations is consistent with the idea that, in speech motor learning, the brain acquires instance-specific memories. The results support the hypothesis that speech motor learning is fundamentally local.

Adenosylcobalamin is required for activity of mitochondrial methylmalonylCoA mutase and methylcobalamin is required for activity of cytoplasmic methionine synthase. Deficiency in cobalamin, or inability to absorb cobalamin normally, can result in accumulation of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine in blood and urine. Methylmalonic acidemia can result in metabolic acidosis which in severe cases may be fatal. Hyperhomocysteinemia along with hypomethioninemia can result in hematologic (megaloblastic anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and neurologic (subacute combined degeneration of the cord, dementia, psychosis) defects. Inborn errors affecting cobalamin absorption (inherited intrinsic factor deficiency, Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome) and transport (transcobalamin deficiency) have been described. A series of inborn errors of intracellular cobalamin metabolism, designated cbIA-cbIG, have been differentiated by complementation analysis. These can give rise to isolated methylmalonic acidemia (cblA, cbIB, cbID variant 2), isolated hyperhomocysteinemia (cbID variant 1, cbIE, cbIG) or combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia (cbIC, classic cbID, cbIF). All these disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. The genes underlying each of these disorders have been identified. Two other disorders, haptocorrin deficiency and transcobalamin receptor deficiency, have been described, but it is not clear that they have any consistent clinical phenotype.

In the present work, we have furthered our analysis of the role of KLF7 in central nervous system development. By gene expression analysis during brain embryogenesis, we found significant alterations in dopaminergic neurons in Klf7 null mice. In particular, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (Dat) transcripts are strongly decreased in the olfactory bulbs and ventral midbrain at birth, compared to wild-type littermates. Interestingly, Klf7-mutant mice show a dramatic reduction of TH-positive neurons in the olfactory bulbs, but no change in GABAergic or midbrain dopaminergic neurons. These observations raise the possibility that a lack of a KLF family member affects dopaminergic neuron development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As the master circadian pacemaker, the SCN coordinates the timing of diverse cellular oscillators in multiple tissues. Aberrant regulation of clock timing is linked to numerous human conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, various neurological disorders and the hereditary disorder familial advanced sleep phase syndrome. Additionally, mechanisms that underlie clock resetting factor into the sleep and physiological disturbances experienced by night-shift workers and travelers with jet lag. The Ca2+/cAMP response element-binding protein-regulated microRNA, miR-132, is induced by light within the SCN and attenuates its capacity to reset, or entrain, the clock. However, the specific targets that are regulated by miR-132 and underlie its effects on clock entrainment remained elusive until now. Here, we show that genes involved in chromatin remodeling (Mecp2, Ep300, Jarid1a) and translational control (Btg2, Paip2a) are direct targets of miR-132 in the mouse SCN. Coordinated regulation of these targets underlies miR-132-dependent modulation of Period gene expression and clock entrainment: the mPer1 and mPer2 promoters are bound to and transcriptionally activated by MeCP2, whereas PAIP2A and BTG2 suppress the translation of the PERIOD proteins by enhancing mRNA decay. We propose that miR-132 is selectively enriched for chromatin-and translation-associated target genes and is an orchestrator of chromatin remodeling and protein translation within the SCN clock, thereby fine-tuning clock entrainment. These findings will further our understanding of mechanisms governing clock entrainment and its involvement in human diseases.

Speech-induced suppression of evoked auditory fields in children who stutter	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Stuttering; Child development; Speech-motor control; Auditory processing; M50; Magnetic source imaging	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; COMMON STEREOTACTIC SPACE; NONSTUTTERING ADULTS; MOTOR CONTROL; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; ACTIVATION PATTERNS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; VOICE KEY; CORTEX; MEG	Auditory responses to speech sounds that are self-initiated are suppressed compared to responses to the same speech sounds during passive listening. This phenomenon is referred to as speech-induced suppression, a potentially important feedback-mediated speech-motor control process. In an earlier study, we found that both adults who do and do not stutter demonstrated a reduced amplitude of the auditory M50 and M100 responses to speech during active production relative to passive listening. It is unknown if auditory responses to self-initiated speech-motor acts are suppressed in children or if the phenomenon differs between children who do and do not stutter. As stuttering is a developmental speech disorder, examining speech-induced suppression in children may identify possible neural differences underlying stuttering close to its time of onset. We used magnetoencephalography to determine the presence of speech-induced suppression in children and to characterize the properties of speech-induced suppression in children who stutter. We examined the auditory M50 as this was the earliest robust response reproducible across our child participants and the most likely to reflect a motor-to-auditory relation. Both children who do and do not stutter demonstrated speech-induced suppression of the auditory M50. However, children who stutter had a delayed auditory M50 peak latency to vowel sounds compared to children who do not stutter indicating a possible deficiency in their ability to efficiently integrate auditory speech information for the purpose of establishing neural representations of speech sounds.

Identification and Characterization of an Inborn Error of Metabolism Caused by Dihydrofolate Reductase Deficiency	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							FOLATE METABOLISM; DIHYDROPTERIDINE REDUCTASE; ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE; METHOTREXATE; TETRAHYDROBIOPTERIN; RISK; BIOSYNTHESIS; FAMILIES; LEUKEMIA; GENES	Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a critical enzyme in folate metabolism and an important target of antineoplastic, antimicrobial, and antiinflammatory drugs. We describe three individuals from two families with a recessive inborn error of metabolism, characterized by megaloblastic anemia and/or pancytopenia, severe cerebral folate deficiency, and cerebral tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency due to a germline missense mutation in DHFR, resulting in profound enzyme deficiency. We show that cerebral folate levels, anemia, and pancytopenia of DHFR deficiency can be corrected by treatment with folinic acid. The characterization of this disorder provides evidence for the link between DHFR and metabolism of cerebral tetrahydrobiopterin, which is required for the formation of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine and for the hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids. Moreover, this relationship provides insight into the role of folates in neurological conditions, including depression, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease.

Changes in expression of various voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs) have been observed under neuropathic conditions and there is evidence for the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in sensory hyperexcitability. Here we demonstrate the contribution of PKC to P2X-evoked VGSC activation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in neuropathic conditions. Results: Using the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain and whole-cell patch clamp recordings of dissociated DRG neurons, we examined changes in excitability of sensory neurons after nerve injury and observed that P2X3 purinoceptor-mediated currents induced by alpha,beta-meATP triggered activation of TTX-sensitive VGSCs in neuropathic nociceptors only. Treatment of neuropathic DRGs with the PKC blocker staurosporine or calphostin C decreased the alpha,beta-meATP-induced Na+ channels activity and reversed neuronal hypersensitivity. In current clamp mode, alpha,beta-meATP was able to evoke action-potentials more frequently in neuropathic neurons than in controls. Pretreatment with calphostin C significantly decreased the proportion of sensitized neurons that generated action potentials in response to alpha,beta-meATP. Recordings measuring VGSC activity in neuropathic neurons show significant change in amplitude and voltage dependence of sodium currents. In situ hybridization data indicate a dramatic increase in expression of embryonic Na(v)1.3 channels in neuropathic DRG neurons. In a CHO cell line stably expressing the Na(v)1.3 subunit, PKC inhibition caused both a significant shift in voltage-dependence of the channel in the depolarizing direction and a decrease in current amplitude. Conclusion: Neuropathic injury causes primary sensory neurons to become hyperexcitable to ATP-evoked P2X receptor-mediated depolarization, a phenotypic switch sensitive to PKC modulation and mediated by increased activity of TTX-sensitive VGSCs. Upregulation in VGSC activity after injury is likely mediated by increased expression of the Na(v)1.3 subunit, and the function of the Na(v)1.3 channel is regulated by PKC.

Methods: We conducted a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of sunitinib in patients with advanced, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. All patients had Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined disease progression documented within 12 months before baseline. A total of 171 patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive best supportive care with either sunitinib at a dose of 37.5 mg per day or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival; secondary end points included the objective response rate, overall survival, and safety. Results: The study was discontinued early, after the independent data and safety monitoring committee observed more serious adverse events and deaths in the placebo group as well as a difference in progression-free survival favoring sunitinib. Median progression-free survival was 11.4 months in the sunitinib group as compared with 5.5 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.66; P<0.001). A Cox proportional-hazards analysis of progression-free survival according to baseline characteristics favored sunitinib in all subgroups studied. The objective response rate was 9.3% in the sunitinib group versus 0% in the placebo group. At the data cutoff point, 9 deaths were reported in the sunitinib group (10%) versus 21 deaths in the placebo group (25%) (hazard ratio for death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.89; P=0.02). The most frequent adverse events in the sunitinib group were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, and fatigue. Conclusions: Continuous daily administration of sunitinib at a dose of 37.5 mg improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and the objective response rate as compared with placebo among patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

Although it is established that the degree of kainate receptor (KAR) activation is shaped by the chemical nature of the agonist molecule, the possible complementary role of external ions has yet to be examined. Here we show that external cations but not anions regulate the responsiveness to a range of full and partial agonists acting on rat GluK2 receptors. This observation is unexpected as previous work has assumed anions and cations affect KARs in an identical manner through functionally coupled binding sites. However, our data demonstrate that anion- and cation-binding pockets behave discretely. We suggest cations uniquely regulate a pregating or flipping step that impacts the closed-cleft stability of the agonist-binding domain (ABD). This model departs from a previous proposal that KAR agonist efficacy is governed by the degree of closure elicited in the ABD by ligand binding. Our findings are, however, in line with recent studies on Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels suggesting that the "flipping" mechanism has been conserved by structurally diverse ligand-gated ion channel families as a common means of regulating neurotransmitter behavior.

Here we describe that in control condition (CC), i.e. following 2 hours of natural sleep in the morning, the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(2)-AR) agonist, clonidine, had no effect on hcrt/orx neurons, whereas following 2 hours of SD (SDC), it hyperpolarized the neurons by activating G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. Since concentrations of clonidine up to a thousand times (100 mu M) higher than those effective in SDC (100 nM), were completely ineffective in CC, a change in the availability of G-proteins is unlikely to explain the difference between the two conditions. To test whether the absence of effect of clonidine in CC could be due to a down-regulation of GIRK channels, we applied baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist known to also activate GIRK channels, and found that it hyperpolarized hcrt/orx neurons in that condition. Moreover, baclofen occluded the response to clonidine in SDC, indicating that absence of effect of clonidine in CC could not be attributed to down-regulation of GIRK channels. We finally tested whether alpha(2)-ARs were still available at the membrane in CC and found that clonidine could reduce calcium currents, indicating that alpha(2)-ARs associated with calcium channels remain available in that condition. Taken together, these results suggest that a pool of alpha(2)-ARs associated with GIRK channels is normally down-regulated (or desensitized) in hcrt/orx neurons to only become available for their inhibition following sleep deprivation.

In mammals, Vangl1 and Vangl2 code for integral membrane proteins that assemble into asymmetrically distributed membrane complexes that establish planar cell polarity in epithelial cells and that regulate convergent extension movements during embryogenesis. To date, VANGL are the only genes in which mutations cause neural tube defects in humans. Three independently arising Lp alleles have been described for Vangl2: D255E, S464N, and R259L. Here we report a common mechanism for both the naturally occurring Lp (S464N) and a novel ENU-induced mutation Lp(m2Jus)(R259L). We show that the S464N and R259L variants stably expressed in polarized MDCK kidney cells fail to reach the plasma membrane, their site for biological function. The mutant variants are retained intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum, colocalizing with ER chaperone calreticulin. Furthermore, the mutants also show a dramatically reduced half-life of similar to 3 h, compared to similar to 22 h for the wild-type protein, and are rapidly degraded in a proteasome-dependent and MG132-sensitive fashion. Coexpressing individually the three known allelic Lp variants with the wild-type protein does not influence the localization of the WT at the plasma membrane, suggesting that the codominant nature of the Lp trait in vivo is due to haploid insufficiency caused by a partial loss of function in a gene dosage-dependent pathway, as opposed to a dominant negative phenotype. Our study provides a biochemical framework for the study of recently identified mutations in hVANGL1 and hVANGL2 in sporadic or familial cases of neural tube defects.

A 66-year-old patient progressively developed a severe sensory disorder, followed by a motor disorder, which evolved over nine years. Symptoms started in the left hand and slowly involved the four limbs. Investigations were consistent with a mixed sensory and motor neuronopathy. A heterozygous change from an alanine to a proline at amino acid 382 was identified in exon 6 of the TARDPB gene (p. A382P). This case expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in the TARDBP gene and shows that sensory neurons can be severely damaged early in the course of the disease, following a propagating process, with an orderly progression from a focal starting point. A combination of severe sensory and motor neuronopathy is rarely encountered in clinical practice. The possibility of an A382P TDP-43 mutation should be considered in patients with such an association.

SIMPLE/LITAF Expression Induces the Translocation of the Ubiquitin Ligase Itch towards the Lysosomal Compartments	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MARIE-TOOTH-DISEASE; EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; PROLINE-RICH LIGAND; TNF-ALPHA FACTOR; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; PROTEIN LIGASE; IDENTIFICATION; DEGRADATION; NEUROPATHY; DOMAIN	LITAF is a small cellular protein with an unknown function. The C-terminus of LITAF contains a highly conserved domain termed the SIMPLE-like domain (SLD), while the N-terminus contains two PPXY motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions with WW-domain containing proteins. LITAF also harbors two endosome/lysosome targeting sequences at its C-terminus, but there has been conflicting reports regarding its intracellular localization. Here, we demonstrate that LITAF is localized to the late endosome/lysosomal compartment in a variety of cell lines. We also show that Itch, a WW-domain containing protein, and LITAF strongly interact and that this interaction depends on the two PPXY motifs in the N-terminus of LITAF. Interestingly, co-expression of LITAF with Itch induces major changes in Itch intracellular localization, bringing Itch from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes. We show that this re-localization is dependent upon the interaction with the PPXY sequences of LITAF, since disruption of these binding motifs completely abrogates Itch re-localization.

Soft tissue wobbling affects trunk dynamic response in sudden perturbations	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Soft tissue wobbling; Spinal loading; Finite element modeling; Sudden perturbation	SEGMENT ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES; FOREFOOT IMPACT LANDINGS; LOW-BACK-PAIN; MUSCLE-STIFFNESS; SPINAL LOADS; IN-VIVO; STABILITY; FORCES; MODEL; DXA	Soft tissue wobbling reduces the transferred impact of external loads on lower limb joints. The present study investigated whether soft tissue wobbling has similar effects on trunk dynamic response to sudden perturbations. Three healthy males were subjected to a series of anteriorly directed trunk position perturbations at three different velocities while trunk kinematics and kinetics were measured. A nonlinear active-passive finite element model of the human trunk was then used to study the effects of soft tissue wobbling on trunk response. Also investigated were the effects on model predictions of including elements simulating the apparatus (rod-harness assembly) transferring motor-generated perturbations to the trunk. Predicted and measured trunk kinematics and kinetics, when accounting for the dynamic effects of both wobbling mass and rod-harness assembly, were in good agreement for all velocities especially early (< 120 ms) after the perturbations (rho > 0.97). Root mean square errors in model predictions increased considerably when neglecting the aforementioned modeling considerations. The trunk wobbling mass and connecting elements between the trunk and the perturbing device, particularly during faster perturbations, substantially attenuated the transferred impact of external loads on the spine (by 33-90 N across perturbation velocities). Such reductions in the impacts transferred, in turn, reduced the predicted demands on the neuromuscular system for control and maintenance of spinal loads and stability. As such, these features should be considered in future biodynamic models of the human trunk aimed at estimating trunk neuromuscular behaviors during sudden perturbations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Young subjects (n = 12) were trained on both a finger MSL task and a control (CTRL) condition, which were administered one week apart in a counterbalanced order. Subjects were asked to practice the MSL or CTRL task in the evening (approximately 9:00 p.m.) and their performance was retested on the same task 12 h later (approximately 9:00 a.m.). Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings were performed during the night following training on either task, and an automatic algorithm was used to detect fast and slow spindles and to quantify their characteristics (i.e., density, amplitude, and duration). Statistical analyses revealed higher fast (but not slow) spindle density after training on the MSL than after practice of the CTRL task. The increase in fast spindle density on the MSL task correlated positively with overnight performance gains on the MSL task and with difference in performance gain between the MSL and CTRL tasks. Together, these results suggest that fast sleep spindles help activate the cerebral network involved in overnight MSL consolidation, while slow spindles do not appear to play a role in this mnemonic process.

Impaired oxidative metabolism in TD due to decreased activity of thiamine-dependent enzymes leads to a multifactorial cascade of events in the brain that include focal decreases in energy status, oxidative stress, lactic acidosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, astrocyte dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, amyloid deposition, decreased glucose utilization, immediate-early gene induction, and inflammation. This review describes our current understanding of the basis of these abnormal processes in TD, their interrelationships, and why this disorder can be useful for our understanding of how decreased cerebral energy metabolism can give rise to cell death in different neurodegenerative disease states.

Glaucoma is a chronic and progressive degenerative neuropathy of the optic nerve with death of RGCs, and is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. A risk factor for glaucoma is high intraocular pressure (IOP). However, the etiology of glaucoma is unknown and it is likely multifactorial, and upregulation of neurotoxic factors is implicated. Glaucoma can often be independent of high IOP (e.g., normal-tension glaucoma), and disease progression is independent of constant high IOP. Currently, the only pharmacological treatments approved for glaucoma are IOP-lowering drugs, which simply delay disease progression. Optic nerve neuropathy, thinning of the nerve fiber layer, degeneration of the axons, and eventual death of the RGCs continue. In the past decade, experimental therapeutic approaches have evolved to address the complex and multifactorial etiology of this disease. Two approaches are the rescue of RGCs from death by utilizing neuroprotection, and the prevention of RGC death by reducing neurotoxicity. This review draws attention to the potential of neuro protection in glaucoma, specifically focusing on growth factors termed neurotrophins and their receptors.	[Saragovi, H.

J	Woch, A; Plamondon, R; O'Reilly, C				Woch, Anna; Plamondon, Rejean; O'Reilly, Christian			Kinematic characteristics of bidirectional delta-lognormal primitives in young and older subjects	HUMAN MOVEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Aging; Velocity; Motor processes; Motor performance; Neuroscience	RAPID HUMAN MOVEMENTS; NATURAL MOTOR BEHAVIORS; MUSCLE SYNERGIES; REACTION-TIME; COORDINATION; REPRESENTATION; GENERATION; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; AGE	In this paper, 14 healthy subjects in two age groups have produced rapid handwriting strokes with a direction reversal. The delta-lognormal model was used to obtain a detailed description of the velocity of these movements and of the neuromuscular synergy that produces them. This modeling also allowed the derivation of new hypothesis on the nature of the slowing effect due to aging (i.e., a direct effect or a coping strategy) and on its repartition on the different steps of the movement production (i.e., its preparation versus its execution). Our analysis revealed a substantial increase of neuromuscular response delays and a decrease of the command amplitudes with age. For the parameters that show a significant decrease in performance, the agonist and antagonist systems were affected similarly. In addition, we observed that the age has a proportional effect on the various time characteristics of the movements and that even in the case of a significant slowing down of the neuromuscular systems, the elderly can still achieve optimal movement responses, characterized by the use of a single delta-lognormal primitive. This performance might be related to the preservation of some movement timing properties and relationships between the agonist and the antagonist neuromuscular systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: One hundred and twenty-nine individuals with early psychosis were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled trial. The participants were randomized to one of two group treatments or to a wait-list control group. Measures included a personality inventory (NEO Five Factor Inventory) and outcome measures of symptomatology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded) and coping strategies (Cybernetic Coping Scale). Results: Cluster analyses revealed three different personality profiles (based on the Five Factor Model) - none specifically linked to psychotic symptoms. No links were revealed between personality traits and symptom change scores. Personality traits were linked to therapeutic improvements in active coping strategies, with extraversion accounting for 17% of the variance. Neuroticism was linked to increased use of passive coping strategies. Active coping strategies were also predicted by profile 1 (holding the highest openness score) with 26% of the variance explained and by profile 3 (the highest extraversion score), with 14% of the variance explained. Conclusions: Individuals with early psychosis can present with distinct personality profiles as would be expected in a non-clinical population. Personality traits do not appear to influence symptomatic treatment outcomes but are linked to behavioural changes, such as the use of coping strategies.

Atypical processing of auditory temporal complexity in autistics	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Auditory cortex; Enhanced perceptual functioning model; Functional magnetic resonance imaging	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; MACAQUE MONKEYS; DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; ABSOLUTE PITCH; SPEECH SOUNDS; CORTEX; CHILDREN; PERCEPTION; FMRI	Autistics exhibit a contrasting combination of auditory behavior, with enhanced pitch processing abilities often coexisting with reduced orienting towards complex speech sounds. Based on an analogous dissociation observed in vision, we expected that autistics' auditory behavior with respect to complex sound processing may result from atypical activity in non-primary auditory cortex. We employed fMRI to explore the neural basis of complex non-social sound processing in 15 autistic and 13 non-autistics, using a factorial design in which auditory stimuli varied in spectral and temporal complexity. Spectral complexity was modulated by varying the harmonic content, whereas temporal complexity was modulated by varying frequency modulation depth. The detection task was performed similarly by autistics and non-autistics. In both groups, increasing spectral or temporal complexity was associated with activity increases in primary (Heschl's gyrus) and non-primary (anterolateral and posterior superior temporal gyrus) auditory cortex Activity was right-lateralized for spectral and left-lateralized for temporal complexity. Increasing temporal complexity was associated with greater activity in anterolateral superior temporal gyrus in non-autistics and greater effects in Heschl's gyrus in autistics. While we observed similar hierarchical functional organization for auditory processing in both groups, autistics exhibited diminished activity in non-primary auditory cortex and increased activity in primary auditory cortex in response to the presentation of temporally, but not of spectrally complex sounds. Greater temporal complexity effects in regions sensitive to acoustic features and reduced temporal complexity effects in regions sensitive to more abstract sound features could represent a greater focus towards perceptual aspects of speech sounds in autism.

Music to my eyes: Cross-modal interactions in the perception of emotions in musical performance	COGNITION			English	Article						Cross-modal interaction; Multi-sensory integration; Music cognition; Emotion; Performance; Expressivity; Gesture; Non-verbal communication	AUDITORY MIRROR SYSTEM; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; NEGATIVE AFFECT; BASIC EMOTIONS; SEEING MUSIC; EXPERIENCE; LANGUAGE; BRAIN; SPACE; MODEL	We investigate non-verbal communication through expressive body movement and musical sound, to reveal higher cognitive processes involved in the integration of emotion from multiple sensory modalities. Participants heard, saw, or both heard and saw recordings of a Stravinsky solo clarinet piece, performed with three distinct expressive styles: restrained, standard, and exaggerated intention. Participants used a 5-point Likert scale to rate each performance on 19 different emotional qualities. The data analysis revealed that variations in expressive intention had their greatest impact when the performances could be seen; the ratings from participants who could only hear the performances were the same across the three expressive styles. Evidence was also found for an interaction effect leading to an emergent property, intensity of positive emotion, when participants both heard and saw the musical performances. An exploratory factor analysis revealed orthogonal dimensions for positive and negative emotions, which may account for the subjective experience that many listeners report of having multi-valent or complex reactions to music, such as "bittersweet."

In a longitudinal study, 10 mothers who delivered <= 29 wk gestation and planned to breast-feed received DHA (1200 mg/d) until 36 wk after conception. The plasma DHA status was assessed in their 12 infants (including 2 pairs of twins) from birth to d 49. Fatty acid profiles were measured weekly in breast milk, and in plasma of mothers and infants at baseline and at d15 and 49. Plasma and breast milk fatty acid concentrations in the DHA-supplemented group at d 49 were compared with a reference group of very preterm infants (n = 24, including triplets) whose mothers In = 22) did not receive DHA during lactation. The infants' plasma DHA concentration tended to be greater in the DHA group than in the reference group (P = 0.10) and was greater when expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids (P = 0.009). At d 49, maternal milk DHA in the DHA group (1.92 +/- 1.10 mmol/L) was similar to 12 times higher than in the reference group (0.15 +/- 0.27 mmol/L) (P < 0.001). The amount of DHA provided to the infants increased from wk 1 through wk 7 in the DHA group (P < 0.001). Although enteral intake at wk 7 did not differ between the DHA group [119 +/- 51 mL/(kgd)] and the reference group [113 +/- 66 mL/(kg.d)], DHA group infants received 55 +/- 38 mg/(kg.d) of DHA, and the reference group infants received 7 +/- 11 mg/(kg.d) (P < 0.001). Early supplementation with DHA to lactating mothers with low dietary DHA intake successfully increased the plasma DHA status in very preterm infants. J. Nutr. 141: 231-236, 2011.

They show great potential to help patients with severe motor deficits perform everyday tasks without the constant assistance of caregivers. Understanding the neural mechanisms by which subjects use BCI systems could lead to improved designs and provide unique insights into normal motor control and skill acquisition. However, reports vary considerably about how much training is required to use a BCI system, the degree to which performance improves with practice and the underlying neural mechanisms. This review examines these diverse findings, their potential relationship with motor learning during overt arm movements, and other outstanding questions concerning the volitional control of BCI systems.

J	Butterworth, RF				Butterworth, Roger F.			Rifaximin and Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Editorial Material								Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) occurs in up to 70% of patients with cirrhosis and has a clear impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in these patients. Antibiotics leading to reductions in circulating ammonia have been used in the past for the treatment of MHE. However, serious adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy limit their use to relatively short time periods. In this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, an article by Sidhu et al. demonstrates unequivocally that the antibiotic rifaximin, a minimally absorbed antibiotic with broad spectrum activity, improves psychometric test performance scores and concomitantly improves HRQOL in patients with MHE (the RIME Trial). Rifaximin was well tolerated. Results of the RIME Trial represent an important step in the establishment of this antibiotic as an effective and safe treatment for MHE.

We hypothesized that allogeneic response could provide a platform for immunotherapy in neuroblastoma. We therefore undertook a pilot trial of unrelated cord blood transplantation after reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) in children with relapsed neuroblastoma to assess engraftment and tolerability in this heavily pretreated population. The RIC included CY (50 mg/kg, day -6), fludarabine (40 mg/m(2), days -6 to -2), total body irradiation (200 cGy, day -1), and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg, days -3 to -1). Six patients were enrolled: four were in partial responsive relapse, one with a mixed response and one in refractory relapse. All patients tolerated the regimen well and had donor engraftment with full neutrophil and plt recovery (median time 12 and 35 days, respectively). One patient never experienced neutropenia and another did not need plt transfusions. All patients progressed after transplant (median time 55 days, 26-180 days). Natural killer (NK) cell counts were normal within 2 months, whereas T-cell recovery was slower. In conclusion, unrelated cord blood engrafts after RIC in children with refractory neuroblastoma. Future research should be aimed at transplanting patients with minimal residual disease, using less intensive immunosuppression and adding NK-cell based post transplant immunotherapy.

Methods A survey was conducted within the Canadian Paediatric Brain Tumour Consortium (CPBTC), a group of tertiary care centres in pediatric neurooncology (n = 16) in Canada that are involved in the treatment of children with central nervous system tumours. Results In 10 of the 16 participating pediatric oncology centres of the CPBTC, 137 children with brain tumours were treated with TMZ between January 2000 and March 2006. Although 33% of the children were enrolled into a clinical trial, 67% were treated outside open studies. Most patients (72%) received TMZ treatment on recurrence of their brain tumour (first or subsequent). The most commonly administered regimen was single-agent TMZ 150-200 mg/m(2) administered on 5 consecutive days every 28 days. The median duration of TMZ treatment was 141 days (range: 4-11102 days). Response data were provided for 127 of the 1.37 patients, of whom 6 showed a complete response. Sixteen patients experienced a minor or partial response, 53 had stable disease, and 52 had progressive disease. Of 32 patients alive at last follow-up, 19 had a diagnosis of low-grade glioma. Conclusions Temozolomide is used in a variety of pediatric brain tumours, often at the time of recurrence. The lack of insight into clear indications for this agent in pediatric brain tumours used either alone or in combination therapy may be a result of suboptimal design of phase I and II studies and a lack of phase HI trials in the pediatric brain tumour population.

[F-18]FECH is actively transported into mammalian cells, becomes phosphorylated by choline kinase and gets incorporated into the cell membrane after being metabolized to phosphatidylcholine. So far, its synthesis is a two-step procedure involving at least one HPLC purification step. To allow a wider dissemination of this tracer, finding a purification method avoiding HPLC is highly desirable and would result in easier accessibility and more reliable production of [F-18]FECH. Methods: [F-18]FECH was synthesized by reaction of 2-bromo-1-[F-18]fluoroethane ([F-18]BFE) with dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) in DMSO. We applied a novel and very reliable work-up procedure for the synthesis of [F-18]BFE. Based on a combination of three different solid-phase cartridges, the purification of [F-18]BFE from its precursor 2-bromoethyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonate (BENos) could be achieved without using HPLC. Following the subsequent reaction of the purified [F-18]BFE with DMAE, the final product [F-18]FECH was obtained as a sterile solution by passing the crude reaction mixture through a combination of two CM plus cartridges and a sterile filter. The fully automated synthesis was perforated using as well a Raytest SynChrom module (Raytest, Germany) or a Scintomics HotboxIII module (Scintomics, Germany). Results: The radiotracer [F-18]FECH can be synthesized in reliable radiochemical yields (RCY) of 37 +/- 5% (Synchrom module) and 33 +/- 5% (Hotbox III unit) in less than 1 h using these two fully automated commercially available synthesis units without HPLC involvement for purification. Detailed quality control of the final injectable [F-18]FECH solution proved the high radiochemical purity and the absence of Kryptofix2.2.2, DMAE and DMSO used in the course of synthesis. Sterility and bacterial endotoxin testing following standard procedures verified that the described production method for [F-18]FECH is suitable for human applications. Conclusions: The routine production of [F-18]FECH with sufficient RCYs was established by reliable and fast solid-phase extraction purifications of both the secondary labeling precursor [F-18]BFE and the final product [F-18]FECH, avoiding complex and sensitive HPLC equipment. The purity of the product was >95%, rendering the tracer suitable for human application. The newly developed purification procedure for [F-18]BFE significantly reduces the complexity of the automated synthesis unit, hence reducing the cost for routine production in a clinical setup and allowing easy transfer to different synthesis modules.

Here, we present the results from a large-sample resequencing (n = 285 patients) study of candidate genes coupled with population genetics and statistical methods to identify rare variants associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia. Three genes, MAP1A, GRIN2B, and CACNA1F, were consistently identified by different methods as having significant excess of rare missense mutations in either one or both disease cohorts. In a broader context, we also found that the overall site frequency spectrum of variation in these cases is best explained by population models of both selection and complex demography rather than neutral models or models accounting for complex demography alone. Mutations in the three disease-associated genes explained much of the difference in the overall site frequency spectrum among the cases versus controls. This study demonstrates that genes associated with complex disorders can be mapped using resequencing and analytical methods with sample sizes far smaller than those required by genome-wide association studies. Additionally, our findings support the hypothesis that rare mutations account for a proportion of the phenotypic variance of these complex disorders.

We assessed the effects of age, sex and topography on the dynamics of SW characteristics in a large population (n = 87) of healthy young (23.3 +/- 2.4 years) and middle-aged (51.9 +/- 4.6 years) volunteers. Older subjects showed lower SW density and amplitude than young subjects. Age-related lower SW density in men was especially marked in prefrontal/frontal brain areas, where they originate more frequently. Older subjects also showed longer SW positive and negative phase durations. These last results indicate that, in young subjects, cortical neurons would synchronously enter the SW hyperpolarization and depolarization phases, whereas this process would take longer in older subjects, leading to lower slope and longer SW positive and negative phases. Importantly, after controlling for SW amplitude, middle-aged subjects still showed lower slope than young subjects in prefrontal, frontal, parietal and occipital derivations. Age-related effects on SW density, frequency and positive phase duration were more prominent at the beginning of the night, when homeostatic sleep pressure is at its highest. Age-related SW changes may be associated with changes in synaptic density and white matter integrity and may underlie greater sleep fragmentation and difficulty in recuperating and maintaining sleep under challenges in older subjects.

This difficult task is accomplished in this work by using a new method with two original features: (1) each brain tissue class is locally modeled using a local linear region representative, which allows us to account for the INU in an implicit way and to more accurately position the region's boundaries; and (2) the region models are embedded in the level set framework, so that the spatial coherence of the segmentation can be controlled in a natural way. Our new method has been tested on the ground-truthed Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) database and gave promising results, with Tanimoto indexes ranging from 0.61 to 0.79 for the classification of the white matter and from 0.72 to 0.84 for the gray matter. To our knowledge, this is the first time a region-based level set model has been used to perform the segmentation of real-world MRI brain scans with convincing results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Design: A prospective study. Setting: University hospital. Participants:A total of 61 patients (84% male) with a mean age of 70.39 +/- 4.69 on a waiting list for CABG surgery were enrolled in the study. Intervention: A complete neurocognitive evaluation was performed 1 day before surgery as well as 4 to 7 days and 1 month after surgery. During surgery, rSO(2) was monitored continuously. Measurements and Main Results: POCD was defined as a reduction of 1 standard deviation on 2 or more neuropsychologic indices. Forty-six patients (80.7%) developed early POCD, and 23 (38.3%) showed late POCD. Patients whose rSO(2) decreased to less than 50% during the surgery experienced more POCD 4 to 7 days after surgery (p = 0.04). In addition, a decrease of more than 30% from the patient's baseline rSO(2) was associated with POCD 1 month after surgery (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation is associated with early and late POCD in elderly patients. Cerebral oximetry is a promising tool in the prediction of subtle neuropsychologic deficits and further studies are needed. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Compact Clinical Instrument for Quantifying Suppression	OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE			English	Article						suppression; amblyopia; strabismus; binocular vision	STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; BINOCULAR SUMMATION; CORTICAL-NEURONS; CATS	Purpose. We describe a compact and convenient clinical apparatus for the measurement of suppression based on a previously reported laboratory-based approach. In addition, we report and validate a novel, rapid psychophysical method for measuring suppression using this apparatus, which makes the technique more applicable to clinical practice. Methods. By using a Z800 dual pro head-mounted display driven by a MAC laptop, we provide dichoptic stimulation. Global motion stimuli composed of arrays of moving dots are presented to each eye. One set of dots move in a coherent direction (termed signal) whereas another set of dots move in a random direction (termed noise). To quantify performance, we measure the signal/noise ratio corresponding to a direction-discrimination threshold. Suppression is quantified by assessing the extent to which it matters which eye sees the signal and which eye sees the noise. Results. A space-saving, head-mounted display using current video technology offers an ideal solution for clinical practice. In addition, our optimized psychophysical method provided results that were in agreement with those produced using the original technique. We made measures of suppression on a group of nine adult amblyopic participants using this apparatus with both the original and new psychophysical paradigms. All participants had measurable suppression ranging from mild to severe. The two different psychophysical methods gave a strong correlation for the strength of suppression (rho = -0.83, p = 0.006). Conclusion. Combining the new apparatus and new psychophysical method creates a convenient and rapid technique for parametric measurement of interocular suppression. In addition, this apparatus constitutes the ideal platform for suppressors to combine information between their eyes in a similar way to binocularly normal people. This provides a convenient way for clinicians to implement the newly proposed binocular treatment of amblyopia that is based on antisuppression training.

Sexual reward induces Fos in the cerebellum of female rats	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Paced mating; Copulation; Sexual reward; Cerebellum; Granule; Purkinje; Fastigial; Deep nuclei	CONDITIONED PARTNER PREFERENCE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; PLACE PREFERENCE; SPINAL-CORD; C-FOS; VAGINOCERVICAL STIMULATION; NEUROCHEMICAL BASIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; PREOPTIC AREA; BEHAVIOR	The cerebellum is generally considered a neural structure specialized in motor control and recent imaging data suggest its role in sexual behavior. Herein, we analyzed the pattern of Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) in the cerebellum of female rats allowed to pace copulation as a model of sexual reward in rodents. Ovariectomized, hormone-primed, sexually naive females formed three groups: Pacing, Nonpacing and Control. Pacing occurred in arenas bisected by a middle divider that allowed only females to control sexual interaction with stud males. For nonpaced copulation the divider was removed, and control females were allowed to pace in chambers without a male. Fos-IR was analyzed in granule and Purkinje layers of the 10 cerebellar lobules, and in the fastigial deep nucleus (FDN). Results indicated that Pacing females expressed more Fos-IR in the granule layer compared to Nonpacing and Controls, and more Fos-IR in Purkinje compared to Nonpacing. No differences were observed in FDN. Such response cannot be explained with motor activity because Pacing females moved less in general. We discuss the role of the cerebellum and its connections in the sexual reward induced by pacing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The objectives of this study are to: (1) compare all these definitions of asymmetric SNHL; (2) measure the agreement between these definitions in detecting vestibular schwannoma (VS); and (3) determine the strongest association between an asymmetric SNHL definition and positive VS on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study is a retrospective chart review in a tertiary care center. Cases were included if they were evaluated by an audiometric assessment and a posterior fossa MRI. Definitions of asymmetric SNHL reported in literature were applied to request for a further MRI investigation. The likelihood ratio (LR) for a positive test result (LR+) was the highest for the Rule 3,000 (2.91). On comparing all the other definitions with Rule 3,000, seven of the eight existing definitions have a kappa under the clinical usefulness threshold (Kappa < 0.6). When specification tests were applied, the Chi-square test identified Rule 3,000 with a highly significant P value (P < 0.0001). Rule 3,000, defined as asymmetric SNHL of 15 dB or more at the frequency 3,000 Hz, could serve as a universal referral guide for further MRI investigation. Results show that Rule 3,000 is more reliable to detect VS on MRI, a very simple rule that covers all the eight definitions of asymmetric SNHL reported in literature. This would help to reduce the number of negative MRI and to save time and money. If asymmetric SNHL is less than 15 dB, a biannual audiometry testing follow-up could be done.

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns bind TLRs, thereby triggering NF-kappa B signaling and production of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent data suggest that nonpathogenic molecules resulting from trauma can also trigger inflammation via TLRs. We sought to determine whether peripheral nerve injury could induce the expression of TLR2 on the site of injury-damaged nerves and/or in the central nervous system and to investigate whether TLR2 is necessary for the development of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. We observed a significant increase in TLR2, I kappa B-alpha, and TNF-alpha mRNAs in damaged nerves. Increased inflammation-related molecules were found essentially on ED1(+) macrophages. Expression of both I kappa B-alpha and TNF-alpha in peripheral injured nerves was reduced in TLR2 deficient mice where the recruitment of ED1(+) cells is significantly impaired. Although after peripheral nerve injury, spinal microglia became highly activated showing an increase in Iba-1 immunoreactivity and an enlargement of their cell bodies, neither TLR2 mRNA nor I kappa B-alpha mRNA was detected in activated microglia. Nerve injury-evoked spinal microglial activation was not significantly altered in TLR2 KO mice. Paw withdrawal threshold and latency in response to mechanical and heat stimuli, respectively, decreased shortly after nerve lesion in wild type mice. In TLR2 KO mice, nerve injury-induced thermal hyperalgesia was completely abolished contrary to that seen in wild-type mice, whereas mechanical allodynia was partially reduced. We suggest that TLR2 is necessary for the development of neuropathic pain and its contribution is more important in thermal hypersensitivity than that of mechanical allodynia.

Although many adult MB are treated using paediatric MB protocols, the reported outcomes are inferior to those observed in children. It remains unclear whether biologic differences underlie these clinical observations. We investigated the molecular characteristics of 31 adult MB. Twelve and 19 adult MB were respectively examined using Affymetrix-HG-U133-plus-2.0-genechips and immunohistochemical analyses. 26/31 (84%) of adult MB examined by gene expression and/or immunohistochemical analysis showed evidence of sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway activation. A comparison of adult and paediatric MB showed that most adult tumours cluster within the SHH-active subgroup of paediatric MB. The preponderance of SHH activity in adult MB tumours was also shown by positive SFRP1 immunostaining in 16/19 adult paraffin-embedded adult MB tumour blocks. A smaller proportion of adult tumours exhibited evidence of WNT pathway activation, as confirmed by nuclear beta-catenin staining (9.7%; 3/31). Notably, we found PTCH1 gene mutation in 4/8 samples tested. Similar to children, adult MB has abnormalities in developmental signalling pathways including SHH and WNT. Importantly, we found a preponderance of SHH pathway activation amongst MB tumours in adults. This SHH signature does not appear to correlate with a long-term favourable outcome. Differences in molecular profiles exist between adult and paediatric SHH-driven MB and further investigations are needed to better characterize age-related molecular profiles in this subgroup.

Planar cell polarity pathway regulates actin rearrangement, cell shape, motility, and nephrin distribution in podocytes. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 300: F549-F560, 2011. First published June 9, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00566.2009.-Glomerular podocytes are highly polarized cells characterized by dynamic actin-based foot processes (FPs). Neighboring FPs form specialized junctions, slit diaphragms (SDs), which prevent passage of proteins into the ultrafiltrate. The SD protein complex is linked to cytoskeletal actin filaments and mutations in SD proteins lead to a dramatic change in cell morphology; proteinuria is accompanied by FP retraction and loss of SD structure. Thus, organization of the podocyte cytoskeleton is tightly linked to filtration barrier function. In a variety of cell systems, cytoskeleton arrangement is regulated by the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. PCP signals lead to the appearance of highly organized cellular structures that support directional cell movement and oriented cell division. Derangement of the PCP pathway causes neural tube defects and cystic kidney disease in mice. Here, we establish that the PCP pathway regulates the cytoskeleton of podocytes. We identify expression of core PCP proteins in mouse kidney sections and of PCP transcripts in murine and human cultured podocytes. The pathway is functional since Wnt5a causes redistribution of PCP proteins Dishevelled and Daam1. We also show that Wnt5a treatment changes podocyte morphology, alters nephrin distribution, increases the number of stress fibers, and increases cell motility. In reciprocal experiments, siRNA depletion of the core PCP gene Vangl2 reduced the number of cell projections and decreased stress fibers and cell motility. Finally, we demonstrate direct interactions between Vangl2 and the SD protein, MAGI-2. This suggests that the PCP pathway may be directly linked to organization of the SD as well as to regulation of podocyte cytoskeleton. Our observations indicate that PCP signaling may play an important role both in podocyte development and FP cytoskeleton dynamics.

The authors investigated whether cortical brain development in typically developing children with symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity resembles that found in the syndrome of ADHD. Specifically, they examined whether a slower rate of cortical thinning during late childhood and adolescence, which they previously found in ADHD, is also linked to the severity of symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity in typically developing children. Method: In a longitudinal analysis, a total of 193 typically developing children with 389 neuroanatomic magnetic resonance images and varying levels of symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity (measured with the Conners' Parent Rating Scale) were contrasted with 197 children with ADHD with 337 imaging scans. The relationship between the rates of regional cortical thinning and severity of symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity was determined. Results: Youth with higher levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity had a slower rate of cortical thinning, predominantly in prefrontal cortical regions, bilaterally in the middle frontal/premotor gyri, extending down the medial prefrontal wall to the anterior cingulate; the orbitofrontal cortex; and the right inferior frontal gyrus. For each increase of one point in the hyperactivity/impulsivity score, there was a decrease in the rate of regional cortical thinning of 0.0054 mm/year (SE=0.0019 mm/year). Children with ADHD had the slowest rate of cortical thinning. Conclusions: Slower cortical thinning during adolescence characterizes the presence of both the symptoms and syndrome of ADHD, providing neurobiological evidence for dimensionality of the disorder.

Diaphragmatic function is a major determinant of the ability to successfully wean patients from mechanical ventilation (MV). Paradoxically, MV itself results in a rapid loss of diaphragmatic strength in animals. However, very little is known about the time course or mechanistic basis for such a phenomenon in humans. Objectives: To determine in a prospective fashion the time course for development of diaphragmatic weakness during MV; and the relationship between MV duration and diaphragmatic injury or atrophy, and the status of candidate cellular pathways implicated in these phenomena. Methods: Airway occlusion pressure (TwPtr) generated by the diaphragm during phrenic nerve stimulation was measured in short-term (0.5 h; n = 6) and long-term (>5 d; n = 6) MV groups. Diaphragmatic biopsies obtained during thoracic surgery (MV for 2-3 h; n = 10) and from brain-dead organ donors (MV for 24-249 h; n = 15) were analyzed for ultrastructural injury, atrophy, and expression of proteolysis-related proteins (ubiquitin, nuclear factor-kappa B, and calpains). Measurements and Main Results: TwPtr decreased progressively during MV, with a mean reduction of 32 +/- 6% after 6 days. Longer periods of MV were associated with significantly greater ultrastructural fiber injury (26.2 +/- 4.8 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.6% area), decreased cross-sectional area of muscle fibers (1,904 +/- 220 vs. 3,100 +/- 329 mu m(2)), an increase of ubiquitinated proteins (+19%), higher expression of p65 nuclear factor-kappa B (+77%), and greater levels of the calcium-activated proteases calpain-1, -2, and -3 (+104%, +432%, and +266%, respectively) in the diaphragm. Conclusions: Diaphragmatic weakness, injury, and atrophy occur rapidly in critically ill patients during MV, and are significantly correlated with the duration of ventilator support.

Numerous immune mediators are detected within MS lesions, including CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes suggesting that they participate in the related pathogenesis. Although CD4(+) T lymphocytes are traditionally considered the main actors in MS immunopathology, multiple lines of evidence suggest that CD8(+) T lymphocytes are also implicated in the pathogenesis. In this review, we outline the recent literature pertaining to the potential roles of CD8(+) T lymphocytes both in MS and its animal models. The CD8(+) T lymphocytes detected in MS lesions demonstrate characteristics of activated and clonally expanded cells supporting the notion that these cells actively contribute to the observed injury. Moreover, several experimental in vivo models mediated by CD8(+) T lymphocytes recapitulate important features of the human disease. Whether the CD8(+) T cells can induce or aggravate tissue destruction in the CNS needs to be fully explored. Strengthening our understanding of the pathogenic potential of CD8(+) T cells in MS should provide promising new avenues for the treatment of this disabling inflammatory disease.

The oligodendrocyte is the cell type responsible for myelin production within this compartment. The mutual supply of trophic support between oligodendrocytes and the underlying axons may indicate why demyelinated axons undergo degeneration more readily; the latter contributes to the neural decline in multiple sclerosis (MS). Myelin repair, termed remyelination, occurs in acute inflammatory lesions in MS and is associated with functional recovery and clinical remittances. Animal models have demonstrated that remyelination is mediated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) which have responded to chemotactic cues, migrated into the lesion, proliferated, differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes, and ensheathed demyelinated axons. The limited remyelination observed in more chronic MS lesions may reflect intrinsic properties of neural cells or extrinsic deterrents. Therapeutic strategies currently under development include transplantation of exogenous OPCs and promotion of remyelination by endogenous OPCs. All currently approved MS therapies are aimed at dampening the immune response and are not directly targeting neural processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These barriers function in distinct CNS compartments and their anatomical basis lay on the junctional proteins present in endothelial cells for the BBB and in the choroidal epithelium for the BCB. During neuroinflammatory conditions like multiple sclerosis (MS) and its murine model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), activation or damage of the various cellular components of these barriers facilitate leukocyte infiltration leading to oligodendrocyte death, axonal damage, demyelination and lesion development. This manuscript will review in detail the features of these barriers under physiological and pathological conditions, particularly when focal immune activation promotes the loss of the BBB and BCB phenotype, the upregulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and the recruitment of immune cells.

A mutation in the RNF170 gene causes autosomal dominant sensory ataxia	BRAIN			English	Article						ataxia; sensory neuropathy; gene identification; ring-finger protein; RNF170	DEGRADATION; DISEASE	Autosomal dominant sensory ataxia is a rare genetic condition that results in a progressive ataxia that is caused by degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. To date only two families have been clinically ascertained with this condition, both from Maritime Canada. We previously mapped both families to chromosome 8p12-8q12 and have now screened the majority of annotated protein-coding genes in the shared haplotype region by direct DNA sequencing. We have identified a putative pathogenic mutation in the gene encoding ring-finger protein RNF170, a potential ubiquitin ligase. This mutation is a rare non-synonymous change in a well-conserved residue and is predicted to be pathogenic by SIFT, PolyPhen, PANTHER and Align-GVD. Microinjection of wild-type or mutant orthologous messenger RNAs into zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos confirmed that the mutation dominantly disrupts normal embryonic development. Together these results suggest that the mutation in RNF170 is causal for the sensory ataxia in these families.

Although PM is crucial for daily functioning, few sensitive, valid and ecological clinical tests are available. To address these concerns, the authors developed a PM task, the TEMP, using naturalistic stimuli, in which each PM phase and component is evaluated independently in time- and event-based conditions. Main outcomes and results: The results show that moderate and severe TBI patients (n = 30), evaluated after spontaneous neurological recovery, experienced problems in learning the delayed intentions content and retrieving these intentions in the right context (prospective component), especially in the time-based condition. They also recalled fewer associated actions (retrospective component), but only in the time-based condition. Correlations revealed that the retrospective component was mainly supported by episodic retrospective memory processes, while the prospective component was supported by episodic retrospective memory processes, along with attentional and executive functions. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between performance on the TEMP and results on a questionnaire assessing PM functioning in daily living completed by participants' relatives. Conclusions: The TEMP therefore appears to be a sensitive tool for assessing PM problems that combines internal and ecological validity.

It can also be employed to notify patients or healthcare personnel when the bladder should be emptied. An early warning can be triggered either when functional bladder capacity is reached or when an abnormally high postvoiding residual volume remains in the bladder after an unfinished voiding. Currently, neuroprosthetic implants are used in the treatment of refractory patients with overactive bladder, with urgency-frequency or with voiding complications. These implants can further enhance their performance, and also reduce their adverse-effects, by implementing a conditional stimulation based on the ongoing information of bladder volume. In this paper, we review the measurement methods used in past studies, we analyze and assess them, and lastly we pinpoint the one that we consider the optimal one for chronic monitoring of bladder volume.

J	Hyde, KL; Zatorre, RJ; Peretz, I				Hyde, Krista L.; Zatorre, Robert J.; Peretz, Isabelle			Functional MRI Evidence of an Abnormal Neural Network for Pitch Processing in Congenital Amusia	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						brain; connectivity; fMRI; music; tone deafness	AUDITORY-CORTEX; BRAIN RESPONSES; TONE-DEAFNESS; DISORDER; CONNECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; ADULTS; FMRI; TUNE	Congenital amusia (tone deafness) is a lifelong disorder that prevents typically developing individuals from acquiring basic musical skills. Electrophysiological evidence indicates that congenital amusia is related to a musical pitch deficit that does not seem to arise from a dysfunction of the auditory cortex but rather from an anomaly along a frontotemporal auditory pathway. In order to better localize the neural basis of this pitch disorder, here we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Congenital amusic adults and "musically intact" controls were scanned while passively listening to pure-tone melodic-like sequences in which the pitch distance between consecutive tones was varied parametrically. In both amusics and controls, brain activity increased as a function of increasing pitch distance, even for fine pitch changes, in both the left and right auditory cortices. These results support prior electrophysiological work showing that the auditory cortex of amusic individuals responds normally to pitch. In contrast, the right inferior frontal gyrus showed an abnormal deactivation in the amusic group, as well as reduced connectivity with the auditory cortex as compared with controls. These fMRI data are highly consistent with previous gray and white matter anomalies found in amusics in the auditory and inferior frontal cortices, as well as reduced white matter connections between these 2 regions.

However, organizational differences in networks among individuals remain largely unknown. Here, we utilize diffusion tensor imaging tractography and graph-theoretical approaches to investigate the effects of sex and brain size on the topological organization of human cortical anatomical network. Weighted cortical networks were constructed from 72 young healthy participants by measuring anatomical connection densities between 78 cortical regions. As expected, all participants showed a small-world topology (high local clustering and short paths between nodes), which suggests a highly efficient topological organization. Furthermore, we found that females had greater local efficiencies than males. Moreover, smaller brains showed higher local efficiency in females but not in males, suggesting an interaction between sex and brain size. Specifically, we show that several brain regions (e.g., the precuneus, precentral gyrus, and lingual gyrus) had significant associations between nodal centrality and sex or brain size. Our findings suggest that anatomical network organization in the human brain is associated with sex and brain size and provide insights into the understanding of the structural substrates that underlie individual differences in behavior and cognition.

A population-based study on choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) and choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) was carried out to describe the incidence, demographic, and outcome data and to identify potential prognostic factors. The CPT population from the Canadian databank of CNS tumor in children a parts per thousand currency sign36 months diagnosed between 1990 and 2005 was reviewed Out of the 579 reported cases of CNS tumors, 37 were CPT. The annual age-adjusted incidence rate was 0.22 + 0.12 (95% CI 0.16-0.28)/100,000 children < 3 years. There were 21 (56.7%) CPP and 16 (43.3.5%) CPC. Twenty patients (54%) were males. Median age at diagnosis was 7 months(range 0-30). Ten patients(62.5%) with CPC and one with CPP were metastatic at diagnosis. Twenty patients with CPP (95%) had a complete resection, whereas 6/16 CPC (37.5%) achieved a resection > 90%. Fourteen CPC patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. None of the 37 patients received adjuvant radiation. At completion of survey, all CPP and five CPC were alive. Median survival time for CPC patients was 15 months (0-120). One death was related to intraoperative hemorrhage, another to chemotherapy-induced toxicity, and one to secondary AML. Age at diagnosis, degree of resection and metastatic status were not significant prognostic factors for CPC. By contrast to CPC, CPP have an excellent prognosis following surgery alone. Survival of CPC remains poor. However, these data may suggest adjuvant chemotherapy can alter the aggressive natural history of CPC. As with other rare CNS tumors, international collaboration is required to identify optimal therapy.

OTX2 microphthalmia syndrome: four novel mutations and delineation of a phenotype	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						anophthalmia; microphthalmia; OTX2; pituitary	SOX2 ANOPHTHALMIA SYNDROME; DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY; BRAIN MORPHOGENESIS; HORMONE DEFICIENCY; GENE; MALFORMATIONS; HEAD; PAX6	The OTX2 homeobox-containing transcription factor gene was shown to play a key role in the development of head structures in vertebrates. In humans, OTX2 mutations result in anophthalmia/microphthalmia (A/M) often associated with systemic anomalies. We screened 52 unrelated individuals affected with A/M and identified disease-causing variants in four families (8%), a higher frequency than previously reported. All four mutations are predicted to result in truncation of normal OTX2 protein sequence, consistent with previously reported mechanisms; three changes occurred de novo and one mutation was inherited from an affected parent. Four of the five OTX2-positive patients in our study displayed additional systemic findings, including two novel features, Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome and an anteriorly placed anus. Analysis of the phenotypic features of OTX2-positive A/M patients in this study and those previously reported suggests the presence of pituitary anomalies and lack of genitourinary and gastrointestinal manifestations as potential distinguishing characteristics from SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome. Interestingly, pituitary anomalies seem to be more strongly associated with mutations that occur in the second half of OTX2, after the homeodomain and SGQFTP motif. OTX2 patients also show a high rate of inherited mutations (35%), often from mildly or unaffected parents, emphasizing the importance of careful parental examination/testing.	[Semina, E.

Transgenic Mice as a Model of Pre-Clinical Alzheimer's Disease	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article						A beta-oligomers; ADDLs; cholinergic synapse; IDE; neprilysin; pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease	AMYLOID-BETA-PROTEIN; INSULIN-DEGRADING ENZYME; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; INTRANEURONAL A-BETA-42 ACCUMULATION; A-BETA; PRECURSOR PROTEIN; DOWN-SYNDROME; CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; SECRETED OLIGOMERS	At diagnosis, Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains are extensively burdened with plaques and tangles and display a degree of synaptic failure most likely beyond therapeutic treatment. It is therefore crucial to identify early pathological events in the progression of the disease. While it is not currently feasible to identify and study early, pre-clinical stages of AD, transgenic (Tg) models offer a valuable tool in this regard. Here we investigated cognitive, structural and biochemical CNS alterations occurring in our newly developed McGill-Thyl-APP Tg mice (over-expressing the human amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish and Indiana mutations) prior to extracellular plaque deposition. Pre-plaque, 3-month old Tg mice already displayed cognitive deficits concomitant with reorganization of cortical cholinergic pre-synaptic terminals. Conformational specific antibodies revealed the early appearance of intracellular amyloid beta (A beta)-oligomers and fibrillar oligomers in pyramidal neurons of cerebral cortex and hippocampus. At the same age, the cortical levels of insulin degrading enzyme -a well established A beta-peptidase, were found to be significantly down-regulated. Our results suggest that, in the McGill-Thy1-APP Tg model, functional, structural and biochemical alterations are already present in the CNS at early, pre-plaque stages of the pathology. Accumulation of intraneuronal neurotoxic A beta-oligomers (possibly caused by a failure in the clearance machinery) is likely to be the culprit of such early, pre-plaque pathology. Similar neuronal alterations might occur prior to clinical diagnosis in AD, during a yet undefined 'latent' stage. A better understanding of such pre-clinical AD might yield novel therapeutic targets and or diagnostic tools.	[Ferretti, M. T.; Partridge, V.; Leon, W. C.; Canneva, F.; Allard, S.; Arvanitis, D.

The inspiration of nanoparticles as delivery vehicles for drugs or genes arose from the concept of viral mediated delivery. Researchers envied the enhanced transport efficiency of viruses but required a delivery method that did not incorporate the virus-induced pathological, immunological and oncological side-effects. Thus, bio-mimicked nanoparticles were prepared from synthetic polymers for efficient delivery of therapeutic molecules. However, biotherapeutics delivery across blood-brain-barrier is still a challenging task due to the inherent neuroprotective mechanism of the human brain. Recent studies suggest that cationic cell penetrating peptides can be used in designing targeted nanoparticles. This review describes the anatomical and physiological barriers of the brain with their special features and limitations for drug delivery and role of cationic cell penetrating peptides in designing nanoparticles for targeted biotherapeutics delivery to the brain. It emphasises the use of polymeric nanoparticles and their characteristics with respect to size, surface tolerability and multifunctionality. These properties aid them to cross the biological barriers of the brain. The multifunctionality of nanoparticles has been further explored with the application of cell penetrating peptides conjugated with nanoparticles for delivery at specialized location. The utilization of peptides on nanoparticles has encouraged and facilitated the approach of using non-invasive techniques not only to deliver drugs but also genes and proteins with minimal side-effects and toxicity when compared to conventional invasive techniques of therapeutic delivery to the brain. This technology has shown to be promising as a possible treatment method for a number of neurological disorders in both in vitro and in vivo models.

Methods of Study Selection We searched the PubMed and Pub Chem databases by combining the search terms "oxaliplatie or "platinum" or both, with "clinical trials," "pharmacokinetics," and "pharmacodynamics." Data Extraction and Synthesis Oxaliplatin has a complicated pharrnacokinetic profile, with activity against digestive cancers in particular. It has several mechanisms of action, but cancer cells can develop resistance. Real or potential synergism has been observed when oxaliplatin is combined with other cytotoxic agents or molecularly targeted agents. Peripheral neuropathy is a prominent toxic effect. Conclusions Oxaliplatin lends itself to further clinical research in combination with molecularly targeted therapy.

We investigated the contribution of inflammation to the alteration of normal brain circuitries in the context of neuro-excitotoxicity following neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions in rats with ibotenic acid, an NMDA glutamate receptor agonist. Excitotoxic ibotenic acid lesions led to a significant and persistent astrogliosis and microglial activation, associated with the production of inflammatory mediators. This response was accompanied by a significant increase in metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5) expression within two distinct neuroinflammatory cell types; astrocytes and microglia. The participation of inflammation to the neurotoxin-induced lesion was further supported by the prevention of hippocampal neuronal loss, glial mGluR5 expression and some of the behavioral perturbations associated to the excitotoxic lesion by concurrent anti-inflammatory treatment with minocycline. These results indicate that neuroinflammation significantly contributes to long-lasting excitotoxic effects of the neurotoxin and to some behavioral phenotypes associated with this model. Thus, the control of the inflammatory response may prevent the deleterious effects of excitotoxic processes that are triggered during brain development, limiting the risk to develop some of the behavioral manifestations related to these processes in adulthood.

In contrast, independent component analysis (ICA) can extract blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses without imposing constraints on the HRF. ICA might therefore detect responses that vary in time and shape, and that are not detected in the GLM analysis. In this study, we compared the findings of ICA and GLM analyses in 12 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Spatial ICA was used to extract independent components from the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. A deconvolution method identified component time courses significantly related to the generalized EEG discharges, without constraining the shape of the HRF. The results from the ICA analysis were compared to those from the GLM analysis. GLM maps and ICA maps showed significant correlation and revealed BOLD responses in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, and default mode areas. In patients with a low rate of discharges per minute, the GLM analysis detected BOLD signal changes within the thalamus and the caudate nucleus that were not revealed by the ICA. In conclusion, ICA is a viable alternative technique to GLM analyses in EEG-fMRI studies related to generalized discharges. This study demonstrated that the BOLD response largely resembles the standard HRF and that GLM analysis is adequate. However, ICA is more dependent on a sufficient number of events than GLM analysis.

Methods: This was a medical chart review of all children hospitalized in a French Canadian pediatric hospital in Montreal in the spring and fall of 2009 with a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction for novel influenza A (H1N1) and flu-like symptoms. Results: We included 202 children with a median age of 4.9 (range 0.1-18) years. Demographic and clinical features of the children in the two waves were similar. One or more underlying medical conditions were found in 59% of the children. Clinical findings at admission were: fever (98%), cough (88%), congestion/rhinorrhea (58%), gastrointestinal symptoms (47%), oxygen saturation below 95% (33%), sore throat (20%), and neurological symptoms (9%). Admission to the intensive care unit was required for 22 (11%) children, and 14 patients needed respiratory support. During the second wave, the median duration of stay was shorter (3 vs. 4 days, p = 0.003) and oseltamivir was used more often (84% vs. 40%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Children hospitalized during the two successive waves of H1N1 were mainly school-aged and suffered from moderate disease. Although clinical features and severity of disease were similar, oseltamivir was prescribed more frequently and the length of hospital stay was shorter in the second wave.

However, no psychometrically sound multidimensional depression questionnaires specifically designed for the ESM-EMA context are currently available. Aims: The main objective of the present study was to develop and validate a very short visual analog scale of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scales (CES-D-VAS-VS) specifically designed for the ESM-EMA context. To this end, the full French version of the CES-D was adapted for the ESM-EMA context. From this full-length adapted version a very short version was then extracted from this longer instrument and validated. Study design: A sample comprising 163 patients with a major depressive episode (MDE) and 306 participants without mental disorders was involved in this study. Results: The obtained results provided support for the factor validity, strong measurement invariance (invariance of the loadings and intercepts of the measurement model) across sex and clinical status groups, reliability and convergent validity of the CES-D-VAS-VS. This instrument comprises 4 items measuring positive affect, depressive affect, somatic complaints and disturbed interpersonal relationships. Conclusion: The present results provide preliminary evidence regarding the construct validity of the CES-D-VAS-VS among patients and community adults sample but also underline the need to rely on latent variables methods in the use of this instrument to account for the differential levels of measurement errors (uniquenessess) that were observed across groups.

In experimental settings, fibromyalgia is associated with lowered pain thresholds (hyperalgesia) and deficient pain inhibition. Similarly, it has been recently proposed that the proneness of patients with MDD to develop chronic pain results from a deficit in pain inhibition. This cross-sectional study measured experimentally induced pain perception and inhibition in patients with MDD and patients with fibromyalgia. Method: Participants were 29 patients with fibromyalgia (American College of Rheumatology criteria), 26 patients with MDD (DSM-IV criteria), and 40 healthy controls who did not differ in age, sex, or the presence or absence of a menstrual cycle. Data were collected between June 2007 and May 2008. Thermal stimuli were used to measure pain thresholds. Pain inhibition was elicited using a tonic thermal test (Peltier thermode) administered before and after activation of the diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) by means of a cold pressor test. Results: Thermal pain thresholds were higher in healthy controls compared to patients with MDD and patients with fibromyalgia. Pain ratings during the cold pressor test were lower in healthy controls and patients with MDD relative to patients with fibromyalgia. Finally, DNIC efficacy was stronger in healthy controls compared to patients with fibromyalgia, while no significant differences were found between healthy controls and patients with MDD. Conclusions: Our results suggest that (1) fibromyalgia and MDD are both associated with signs of hyperalgesia, (2) hyperalgesia is more pronounced in fibromyalgia, and (3) the deficit of pain inhibition is specific to fibromyalgia. As such, these results suggest that there is an overlap between fibromyalgia and MDD, but that fibromyalgia can be distinguished from MDD in terms of DNIC efficacy.

In healthy participants, rTMS applied over the language-related areas in the left hemisphere, including the left posterior temporal area of Wernicke (LTMP) and inferior frontal area of Broca, have been shown to affect performance on word recognition tasks. To investigate the neural substrate of these behavioral effects, off-line rTMS was combined with fMRI acquired during the performance of a word recognition task. Twenty right-handed healthy men underwent fMRI scans before and after a session of 10-Hz rTMS applied outside the magnetic resonance scanner. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired during the performance of a word recognition task that used English or foreign-language words. rTMS was applied over the LTMP in one group of 10 participants (LTMP group), whereas the homologue region in the right hemisphere was stimulated in another group of 10 participants (RTMP group). Changes in task-related fMRI response (English minus foreign languages) and task performances (response time and accuracy) were measured in both groups and compared between pre-rTMS and post-rTMS. Our results showed that rTMS increased task-related fMRI response in the homologue areas contralateral to the stimulated sites. We also found an effect of rTMS on response time for the LTMP group only. These findings provide insights into changes in neural activity in cortical regions connected to the stimulated site and are consistent with a hypothesis raised in a previous review about the role of the homologue areas in the contralateral hemisphere for preserving behavior after neural interference.

We previously characterized BALB/c Mthfr (-/-)mice as a model for this disorder and have recently backcrossed the disrupted allele onto the C57Bl/6 background to examine the variable phenotypes in MTHFR deficiency. Compared with BALB/c Mthfr (-/-)mice, C57Bl/6 Mthfr (-/-)mice have enhanced survival rates (81% vs 26.5%). Four-day-old BALB/c mutant pups had lower body, brain, and spleen weights relative to their wild-type counterparts compared with C57Bl/6 mutants. Pregnant BALB/c Mthfr (+/-)mice had increased resorptions and embryonic delays compared with wild-type littermates, whereas these outcomes in C57Bl/6 c Mthfr (+/-)mice were similar to those of wild-type C57Bl/6 mice. BALB/c-mutant pups had altered hematological profiles (higher hematocrit, hemoglobin, and white blood cell counts, with lower platelet counts) compared with C57Bl/6 mutants. Mutants of both strains had similar degrees of hepatic steatosis, hepatic activity of betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase, and altered cerebellar histology. Electroretinograms (ERG) in C57Bl/6 Mthfr (-/-)mice revealed decreased amplitude of scotopic and photopic waves in 6-week-old mice, with normalized ERGs at 13 weeks. Plasma homocysteine was modestly higher in C57Bl/6 compared with BALB/c mice. Our results emphasize the variable presentation of MTHFR deficiency in different genetic backgrounds and suggest that plasma homocysteine is not a predictor of severity. In addition, our novel findings of decreased spleen weights, thrombocytopenia, and impaired retinal function warrant investigation in patients with severe MTHFR deficiency or other forms of homocystinuria.

Stress-induced expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor is regulated by O-GlcNAcylation of the Sp1 transcription factor	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						injury; nerve growth factor receptor; neurotrophin; osmolarity; promoter; transcription	GLCNAC INHIBITS INTERACTION; GLOMERULAR MESANGIAL CELLS; SYNTHETASE GENE-EXPRESSION; CALMODULIN GENE; SPINAL-CORD; NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC PROTEINS; HEXOSAMINE PATHWAY; RAT HEPATOCYTES; KAPPA-B; GLYCOSYLATION	P>Injury-induced expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in the CNS induces neuronal apoptosis and prevents neuronal regrowth. The mechanisms regulating injury-induced p75NTR expression are poorly characterized but previous studies have established that reductions in extracellular osmolarity which mimic cytotoxic edema induce p75NTR gene expression through pathways that activate the Sp1 transcription factor. In this report, we examined how extracellular osmolarity converges on Sp1 to regulate p75NTR expression. We report that levels of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), the enzyme that mediates O-linked attachment of GlcNAc, are reduced by extracellular hypo-osmolarity and that global levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation and of Sp1 show a corresponding decline. We demonstrate that chemical and RNAi-based treatments that reduce cellular O-GlcNAcylation facilitate p75NTR induction by hypo-osmolarity, directly linking protein O-GlcNAcylation to p75NTR induction. To determine if Sp1 O-GlcNAc content regulates p75NTR expression, we replaced endogenous Sp1 with a Sp1 mutated at O-GlcNAc target residues. This O-GlcNAc-deficient form of Sp1-enhanced p75NTR expression, demonstrating that O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 negatively regulates p75NTR expression. We conclude that a stress-induced decline in the O-GlcNAc content of Sp1 drives expression of p75NTR.

Multimodal integration after unilateral labyrinthine lesion: single vestibular nuclei neuron responses and implications for postural compensation. J Neurophysiol 105: 661-673, 2011. First published December 8, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00788.2010. Plasticity in neuronal responses is necessary for compensation following brain lesions and adaptation to new conditions and motor learning. In a previous study, we showed that compensatory changes in the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) following unilateral vestibular loss were characterized by dynamic reweighting of inputs from vestibular and extravestibular modalities at the level of single neurons that constitute the first central stage of VOR signal processing. Here, we studied another class of neurons, i.e., the vestibular-only neurons, in the vestibular nuclei that mediate vestibulospinal reflexes and provide information for higher brain areas. We investigated changes in the relative contribution of vestibular, neck proprioceptive, and efference copy signals in the response of these neurons during compensation after contralateral vestibular loss in Macaca mulata monkeys. We show that the time course of recovery of vestibular sensitivity of neurons corresponds with that of lower extremity muscle and tendon reflexes reported in previous studies. More important, we found that information from neck proprioceptors, which did not influence neuronal responses before the lesion, were unmasked after lesion. Such inputs influenced the early stages of the compensation process evidenced by faster and more substantial recovery of the resting discharge in proprioceptive-sensitive neurons. Interestingly, unlike our previous study of VOR interneurons, the improvement in the sensitivity of the two groups of neurons did not show any difference in the early or late stages after lesion. Finally, neuronal responses during active head movements were not different before and after lesion and were attenuated relative to passive movements over the course of recovery, similar to that observed in control conditions. Comparison of compensatory changes observed in the vestibuloocular and vestibulospinal pathways provides evidence for similarities and differences between the two classes of neurons that mediate these pathways at the functional and cellular levels.

To do so, we develop a framework where workers have heterogeneous skills and where in-migration expands the range of available skills in the economy. In the short run, this expansion leads to productivity gains, which may more than offset the negative endowment effects of a larger labor supply so that all workers may be better off. In the long run, in-migration impacts wages further by altering the workers' incentives to acquire skills, thereby affecting the wage structure indirectly by changing the economy's skill composition. Since the short and the long-run effects of in-migration on wages may differ, compositional changes may be an important element to take into consideration. A numerical illustration calibrated on U. S. data suggests that the immigration of skilled workers negatively affects the incentives for domestic skill formation, thereby suggesting that endowment effects dominate externalities. We finally extend the model to cope with the simultaneous impacts that migration and skill formation have on the host and the source region, and we show that more migration increases wage disparities and the skill gap across regions.

This is due to the fact that in many practical applications there are limitations in space, weight, etc. of the smart structures, which make the problem of positioning more complex. In addition, it is required that the actuators/sensors have the best possible performance. The development of smart structures technology in recent years has provided numerous opportunities for vibration control applications. The use of piezoelectric ceramics or polymers has shown great promise in the development of this technology. The employment of piezoelectric material as actuators in vibration control is beneficial because these actuators only excite the elastic modes of the structures without exciting the rigid-body modes. This is important since very often only elastic motions of the structures are needed to be controlled. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel approach developed for optimizing the location of piezoelectric actuators for vibration suppression of flexible structures. A flexible fin with bonded piezoelectric actuators is considered in this study. The frequency response function (FRF) of the system is then recorded and maximization of the FRF peaks is considered as the objective function of the optimization algorithm to find the optimal placement of the piezoelectric actuators on the smart fin. Three multi-layer perceptron neural networks are employed to perform surface fitting to the discrete data generated by the finite element method (FEM). Invasive weed optimization (IWO), a novel numerical stochastic optimization algorithm, is then employed to maximize the weighted summation of FRF peaks. Results indicate an accurate surface fitting for the FRF peak data and an optimal placement of the piezoelectric actuators for vibration suppression is achieved. (C) 2009 The Franklin Institute.

Although gender differences in suicide rates have been partially explained by environmental and behavioral factors, it is possible that genetic factors, through differential expression between genders, may also help explain gender moderation of suicide risk. This study investigated X-linked genes in suicide completers using a two-step strategy. We first took advantage of the genetic structure of the French-Canadian population and genotyped 722 unrelated French-Canadian male subjects, of whom 333 were suicide completers and 389 were non-suicide controls, using a panel of 37 microsatellite markers spanning the entire X chromosome. Nine haplotype windows and several individual markers were associated with suicide. Significant results aggregated primarily in two regions, one in the long arm and another in the short arm of chromosome X, limited by markers DXS8051 and DXS8102, and DXS1001 and DXS8106, respectively. The second stage of the study investigated differential brain expression of genes mapping to associated regions in Brodmann areas 8/9, 11, 44 and 46, in an independent sample of suicide completers and controls. Six genes within these regions, Rho GTPase-activating protein 6, adaptor-related protein complex 1 sigma 2 subunit, glycoprotein M6B, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 90 kDa polypeptide 3, spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase 1 and THO complex 2, were found to be differentially expressed in suicide completers.

Anatomically distinct dopamine release during anticipation and experience of peak emotion to music	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DORSAL STRIATUM; HEALTHY-MEN; REWARD; PET; REGISTRATION; VALIDATION; PREDICTION; SUBSTRATE	Music, an abstract stimulus, can arouse feelings of euphoria and craving, similar to tangible rewards that involve the striatal dopaminergic system. Using the neurochemical specificity of [C-11]raclopride positron emission tomography scanning, combined with psychophysiological measures of autonomic nervous system activity, we found endogenous dopamine release in the striatum at peak emotional arousal during music listening. To examine the time course of dopamine release, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging with the same stimuli and listeners, and found a functional dissociation: the caudate was more involved during the anticipation and the nucleus accumbens was more involved during the experience of peak emotional responses to music. These results indicate that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatal system. Notably, the anticipation of an abstract reward can result in dopamine release in an anatomical pathway distinct from that associated with the peak pleasure itself. Our results help to explain why music is of such high value across all human societies.

Drug-resistant focal epilepsy is, however, potentially curable by surgery. Although lesions associated with the epileptic focus can often be accurately detected by MRI, in many patients conventional imaging based on visual evaluation is unable to pinpoint the surgical target. Patients with so-called cryptogenic epilepsy represent one of the greatest clinical challenges in many tertiary epilepsy centers. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that epilepsies that are considered cryptogenic are not necessarily nonlesional, the primary histopathological substrate being subtle cortical dysplasia. This Review considers the application of new advances in brain imaging, such as MRI morphometry, computational modeling and diffusion tensor imaging. By revealing dysplastic lesions that previously eluded visual assessments, quantitative structural MRI methods such as these have clearly demonstrated an increased diagnostic yield of epileptic lesions, and have provided successful surgical options to an increasing number of patients with 'cryptogenic' epilepsy.

To date, these therapies have been evaluated solely in the context of adult MS. However, onset of MS in children is being increasingly recognized, and recent studies have identified a significant impact of MS onset during childhood on cognitive and physical functioning. Optimization of pediatric MS care requires that promising new therapies be made available to children and adolescents, but also that safety and tolerability and potential influence of therapies on the developing immune and neural networks of pediatric patients be closely considered. We propose care algorithms illustrating models for therapy that detail careful monitoring of pediatric patients with MS, provide definitions for inadequate treatment response and treatment escalation, and foster multinational collaboration in future therapeutic trials.
