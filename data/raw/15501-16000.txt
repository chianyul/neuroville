J	Shah, AP; Baum, SR				Shah, AP; Baum, SR			Perception of lexical stress by brain-damaged individuals: Effects on lexical-semantic activation	APPLIED PSYCHOLINGUISTICS			English	Article							SPOKEN-WORD RECOGNITION; PHONETIC CATEGORIZATION; SPEECH PROSODY; BROCA APHASICS; COMPREHENSION; SEGMENTATION; ACCESS; DISTURBANCES; COMPETITION; LANGUAGE	A semantic priming, lexical-decision study was conducted to examine the ability of left- and right-brain damaged individuals to perceive lexical-stress cues and map them onto lexical-semantic representations. Correctly and incorrectly stressed primes were paired with related and unrelated target words to tap implicit processing of lexical prosody. Results conformed with previous studies involving implicit perception of lexical stress, in that the left-hemisphere damaged individuals showed preserved sensitivity to lexical stress patterns as indicated by priming patterns mirroring those of the normal controls. An increased sensitivity to the varying stress patterns of the primes was demonstrated by the right-hemisphere damaged patient group, however. Results are discussed in relation to current theories of prosodic lateralization, with a particular focus on the nature of task demands in lexical stress perception studies.

Activation of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) leads to a proangiogenic response, but its mechanisms have yet to be specifically described. Here, we investigated the mode of action of PAR2 in retinal angiogenesis. Methods and Results-PAR2-activating peptide, SLIGRL, increased retinal angiogenesis associated with an induction of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin-2 and most notably tie2 in the retina in vivo as well as in cultured neuroretinal endothelial cells. SLIGRL also induced release of the proinflammatory and angiogenic mediator tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) via the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (MEK/ERK) pathway in these endothelial cells. TNF-alpha, in turn, elicited tie2 expression by activating the MEK/ERK pathway. PAR2-evoked tie2 expression, endothelium proliferation (in vitro), and retinal neovascularization (in vivo) were abrogated by selective TNF-alpha blockers (neutralizing antibody infliximab and soluble TNF-alpha receptor-Fc fusion protein etanercept) as well as the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Conclusion-The proangiogenic properties of PAR2 are intertwined with its proinflammatory effects, such that in retinal vasculature, they depend on TNF-alpha and subsequent induction of tie2 via the MEK/ERK pathway.

J	Fellows, LK				Fellows, LK			Deciding how to decide: ventromedial frontal lobe damage affects information acquisition in multi-attribute decision making	BRAIN			English	Article						executive function; problem solving; prefrontal cortex; human; lesion	SOMATIC MARKER HYPOTHESIS; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; IOWA GAMBLING TASK; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; REWARD PREFERENCE; CHOICE; LESIONS; REVERSAL; QUESTIONS; DEFICITS	Ventromedial frontal lobe (VMF) damage is associated with impaired decision making. Recent efforts to understand the functions of this brain region have focused on its role in tracking reward, punishment and risk. However, decision making is complex, and frontal lobe damage might be expected to affect it at other levels. This study used process-tracing techniques to explore the effect of VMF damage on multi-attribute decision making under certainty. Thirteen subjects with focal VMF damage were compared with 11 subjects with frontal damage that spared the VMF and 21 demographically matched healthy control subjects. Participants chose rental apartments in a standard information board task drawn from the literature on normal decision making. VMF subjects performed the decision making task in a way that differed markedly from all other groups, favouring an 'alternative-based' information acquisition strategy (i.e. they organized their information search around individual apartments). In contrast, both healthy control subjects and subjects with damage predominantly involving dorsal and/or lateral prefrontal cortex pursued primarily 'attribute-based' search strategies (in which information was acquired about categories such as rent and noise level across several apartments). This difference in the pattern of information acquisition argues for systematic differences in the underlying decision heuristics and strategies employed by subjects with VMF damage, which in turn may affect the quality of their choices. These findings suggest that the processes supported by ventral and medial prefrontal cortex need to be conceptualized more broadly, to account for changes in decision making under conditions of certainty, as well as uncertainty, following damage to these areas.

J	Pernet, V; Di Polo, A				Pernet, V; Di Polo, A			Synergistic action of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and lens injury promotes retinal ganglion cell survival, but leads to optic nerve dystrophy in vivo	BRAIN			English	Article						brain-derived neurotrophic factor; lens injury; retinal ganglion cells; neuroprotection; axonal regeneration	RECOMBINANT ADENOASSOCIATED VIRUS; SLOW AXONAL-TRANSPORT; GENE-EXPRESSION; NITRIC-OXIDE; ADULT-RATS; CNTF PROMOTES; GROWTH-STATE; REGENERATION; TRANSDUCTION; NEURONS	Trauma or disease in the CNS often leads to neuronal death and consequent loss of functional connections. The idea has been put forward that strategies aimed at repairing the injured CNS involve stimulation of both neuronal survival and axon regeneration. We tested this hypothesis in the adult rat retinocollicular system by combining two strategies: (i) exogenous administration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a potent survival factor for damaged retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and (ii) lens injury, which promotes robust growth of transected RGC axons. Our results demonstrate that BDNF and lens injury interact synergistically to promote neuronal survival: 71% of RGCs were alive at 2 weeks after optic nerve injury, a time when only similar to 10% of these neurons remain without treatment. Intravitreal injection of BDNF, however, led to regeneration failure following lens injury. The effect of BDNF could not be generalized to other growth factors, as ciliary neurotrophic factor did not cause a significant reduction of lens injury-induced regeneration. Growth arrest in optic nerves treated with BDNF and lens injury correlated with the formation of hypertrophic axonal swellings in the proximal optic nerve. These swellings were filled with numerous vesicular bodies, disorganized neurofilaments and degenerating organelles. Our results demonstrate that: (i) increased neuronal survival does not necessarily lead to enhanced axon regeneration and (ii) activation of survival and growth pathways may produce axonal dystrophy similar to that found in neurodegenerative disorders including glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. We propose that loss of axonal integrity may limit neuronal recovery in the injured, adult CNS.

The relationship of serial N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with duration from symptom onset, infarct size and prognosis in ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with primary percutaneous intervention was examined. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-one STEMI patients in the COMplement inhibition in Myocardial infarction treated with Angioplasty (COMMA) trial, which evaluated pexelizumab versus placebo, were studied. NT-proBNP (pg/mL) was measured at randomization, 24 h and 72 h; creatine kinase-MB area under the curve was measured at 72 h; and QRS score was assessed at discharge. Prognosis was ascertained from the 90-day composite clinical outcome of death, shock, stroke and congestive heart failure. Multivariate logistical regression was used to adjust for baseline characteristics for models at randomization, 24 h and 72 h. NT-proBNP was higher in patients with longer time from symptom onset (P < 0.001) and correlated with measures of infarct size, including the area under the curve (P < 0.001) and QRS score (P < 0.001). Patients reaching the primary end point had markedly higher NT-proBNP at each sampling period (P < 0.001). NT-proBNP at all time points was the strongest independent predictor of the primary end point in the multivariate model: in the 24 h model, only age and 24 h NT-proBNP (C-index 0.83); and only age, Killip class and NT-proBNP was in the 72 h model (C-index 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: Higher NT-proBNP at 24 h correlated with larger infarct size and worse clinical outcomes. NT-proBNP at baseline, 24 h and 72 h after presentation with acute STEMI, is an independent predictor of a poor outcome and adds clinically useful prognostic information.

The objective of our prospective study, therefore, was to determine the long-term health-related quality of life of children with congenital cardiac malformations following open-heart surgery, and to describe the persisting level of stress in their families. To this end, 49 parents completed the Child Health Questionnaire, the Parenting Stress Index, and the Child Behaviour Checklist as part of a developmental follow-up protocol when their child was 5 years of age. Mean scores on the Child Health Questionnaire were in the normal range, with physical well-being equal to 53.5, psychosocial wellbeing 50.9, with only 6.4 percent and 8.5 percent of subjects, respectively, falling within the suboptimal range of less than 40. The distribution of scores on the Parenting Stress Index, however, were more variable, with over one-quarter of parents indicating a high level of stress, with almost one-fifth having low levels of stress, and just over half scoring in the normal range, with the group mean being 52.6 plus or minus 32.3. An abnormal neurologic examination before surgery was associated with lower physical health (beta equal to -5.5, p equal to 0.02, r(2) equal to 0.18), whereas lower arterial saturations of oxygen, less than 85 percent preoperatively, was associated with lower psychosocial health (beta equal to -6.6, p equal to 0.01, and r(2) equal to 0.14). The internalizing and externalizing beliaviours of the child were significantly correlated with psychosocial well being, with r ranging from -0.32 to -0.52, and p less than 0.05. Parental stress also correlated with psychosocial health (r equal to -0.48 and p equal to 0.0009). Overall, the perception by the parents of the health-related quality of life of their child is favourable 5 years following open-heart surgery during infancy. Many parents, nonetheless, continue to feel either stressed or defensive about their child, particularly if their child exhibits behavioural difficulties. Our findings suggest that strategies need to be considered to enhance family wellbeing in the planning and delivery of health services to this population at high risk.

Upon stimulation, NTS1 is rapidly internalized and targeted to lysosomes. This process depends on the interaction of the phosphorylated receptor with beta-arrestin. Little is known about other accessory endocytic proteins potentially involved. Here, we investigated the involvement of dynamin, amphiphysin, and intersectin in the internalization of NTS1 receptor-ligand complexes in transfected COS-7 and HEK 293 cells, by using the transferrin receptor as an internal control for the constitutive endocytic pathway. We found that NTS1 endocytosis was not only arrestin-dependent, but also dynamin-dependent in both COS-7 and HEK 293 cells, whereas internalization of the transferrin receptor was independent of arrestin but required dynamin. Overexpression of the SH3 domain of amphiphysin II had no effect on receptor internalization in either cell type. By contrast, overexpression of full-length intersectin or of its SH3 domain (but not of its EH domain) inhibited NTS1 internalization in COS-7 but not in HEK 293 cells. This difference between COS-7 and HEK 293 cells was not attributable to differences in endogenous intersectin levels between the two cell lines. Indeed, the same constructs inhibited transferrin endocytosis equally well in COS-7 and HEK 293 cells. However, immunogold electron microscopy revealed that internalized NTS1 receptors were associated with clathrin-coated pits in COS-7 cells but with smooth vesicles in HEK 293 cells, suggesting that NTS1 internalization proceeds via different endocytic pathways in these two cell types.

Most previous research has utilized estimates of normal distributions to examine variability. Using a nontraditional approach, the present study evaluated RT distributions on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test in children and adolescents from the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD sample compared to a matched sample of normal controls (n = 65 pairs). The ex-Gaussian curve was used to model RT and RT variability. Children with ADHD demonstrated faster RT associated with the normal portion of the curve and a greater proportion of abnormally slow responses associated with the exponential portion of the curve. These results contradict previous interpretation that children with ADHD have slower titan normal responding and demonstrate why slower RT is found when estimates of variability assume normal Gaussian distributions. Further, results of this study suggest that the greater number of abnormally long RTs of children with ADHD reflect attentional lapses on some but not all trials.

CLINICAL AND INVESTIGATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							ONSET GH DEFICIENCY; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; BODY-COMPOSITION; DOUBLE-BLIND; FACTOR-I; IGF-I; THERAPY; HYPOPITUITARISM; PREVALENCE; CLONIDINE	Purpose: To develop guidelines for the management of growth hormone (GH) deficiency in Canadian adults to facilitate rational use of GH in appropriate indications. Methods: The guidelines were developed by group of endocrinologists and an endocrine specialist nurse with an interest in neuroendocrine disorders, representing all regions of Canada and practicing in a variety of settings. A steering committee with broad expertise undertook a systematic review of the evidence relating to adult GHD and GH replacement. This evidence was reviewed by the whole group, and guidelines were developed using a consensus approach. Results: The document addresses the causes and clinical characteristics of GHD in adults and reviews the evidence in support of GH replacement in this group. The authors provide recommendations for the identification of adult GHD, and guidelines for GH replacement in appropriate patients. Also, access to GH therapy across Canada is reviewed. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults has been a subject of increasing interest in the past two decades. Evidence has accumulated of the adverse consequences of adult GHD, as well as of the benefits of long-term growth hormone (GH) replacement. The use of GH in adults in clinical practice is expanding and widespread concern has been raised about ethical and pharmacoeconomic issues relating to its use and misuse in different clinical and non-clinical scenarios. Such concerns are accentuated by the lack of clear-cut national guidelines, and the authors believe that the development of such guidelines will facilitate rational use of GH in appropriate indications. These guidelines were developed by a consensus group of endocrinologists and an endocrine specialist nurse with an interest in neuroenclocrine disorders, representing all regions of Canada and practicing in a variety of settings. A steering committee with broad expertise (the authors of this document) undertook a systematic review of the evidence relating to adult GHD and GH replacement. This evidence was reviewed by the whole group, and guidelines were developed using a consensus approach. The document addresses the causes and clinical characteristics of GHD in adults, and reviews the evidence in support of GH replacement in this group. The authors provide recommendations for the identification of adult GHD, and guidelines for GH replacement in appropriate patients. The paper also reviews access to GH therapy across Canada. Emphasis was placed on newer diagnostic and management strategies with the understanding that adult GHD is a distinct patho-physiological entity not related to the physiological GH decline associated with normal aging. In this context GH is increasingly suggested as a potential treatment for age-related frailty, osteoporosis, morbid obesity, cardiac failure, and various catabolic conditions. The available placebo controlled studies in these contexts have not reported significant beneficial effects. The use of GH for non-GH deficient subjects as part of an anti-aging regiment is strongly discouraged since there are no human studies that indicate efficacy in this regard. Moreover, compelling data from animal studies suggests that lower GH levels are positively correlated with longevity whereas higher GH levels are associated with a shortened life-span.(1).

J	LeVan, P; Urrestarazu, E; Gotman, J				LeVan, P; Urrestarazu, E; Gotman, J			A system for automatic artifact removal in ictal scalp EEG based on independent component analysis and Bayesian classification	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; seizure; artifacts; automatic; independent component analysis; Bayesian classifiers	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; CONSTRAINED ICA; RECORDINGS; ALGORITHM; REJECTION; DYNAMICS; SPIKES; ONSET; EMG	Objective: To devise an automated system to remove artifacts from ictal scalp EEG, using independent component analysis (ICA). Methods: A Bayesian classifier was used to determine the probability that 2 s epochs of seizure segments decomposed by ICA represented EEG activity, as opposed to artifact. The classifier was trained using numerous statistical, spectral, and spatial features. The system's performance was then assessed using separate validation data. Results: The classifier identified epochs representing EEG activity in the validation dataset with a sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 83.3%. An ICA component was considered to represent EEG activity if the sum of the probabilities that its epochs represented EEG exceeded a threshold predetermined using the training data. Otherwise, the component represented artifact. Using this threshold on the validation set, the identification of EEG components was performed with a sensitivity of 87.6% and a specificity of 70.2%. Most misclassified components were a mixture of EEG and artifactual activity. Conclusions: The automated system successfully rejected a good proportion of artifactual components extracted by ICA, while preserving almost all EEG components. The misclassification rate was comparable to the variability observed in human classification. Significance: Current ICA methods of artifact removal require a tedious visual classification of the components. The proposed system automates this process and removes simultaneously multiple types of artifacts. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Design: Two-centre, observer-blinded, stratified, block-randomized controlled trial. Setting: General community. Patients: Ninety-one individuals within one year of a first or recurrent stroke consented to participate between May 2000 and February 2003. Interventions: The experimental intervention involved practice of functional, unilateral and bilateral tasks that were designed to improve gross and fine manual dexterity whereas the control intervention was composed of walking tasks. Members in both groups participated in three sessions a week for six weeks. Main outcome measure( s): The primary test of arm function was the Box and Block Test. Secondary tests included the Nine-Hole Peg Test, maximal grip strength, the Test d'Evaluation des Membres superieurs des Personnes Agees ( TEMPA) and the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement. Results: Results are for the more affected arm. Baseline performance on the Box and Block Test was an average of 26 blocks ( standard deviation ( SD) = 16) in the experimental group ( n = 47) and 26 blocks ( SD = 18) in the control group ( n = 44). These values represent approximately 40% of age-predicted values. Values for the postintervention evaluation were an average of 28 ( SD = 17) and 28 ( SD = 19) blocks for the experimental and control group respectively. No meaningful change on other measures of arm function was observed. Conclusions: A task-oriented intervention did not improve voluntary movement or manual dexterity of the affected arm in people with chronic stroke.

Syntactic knowledge and processing mechanisms that implement syntax in use are mapped onto neural tissue in experiments that harness both syntactic concepts and imaging technologies to the study of brain mechanisms in healthy and impaired populations. In the emerging picture, syntax is neurologically segregated, and its component parts are housed in several distinct cerebral loci that extend beyond the traditional ones Broca's and Wernicke's regions in the left hemisphere. In particular, the new brain map for syntax implicates portions of the right cerebral hemisphere.

However, despite the publication of several position papers, which attempted to define the utility of MR techniques in the management of MS, their application in everyday clinical practice is still suboptimal. This is probably related, not only, to the fact that the majority of published guidelines focused on the optimization of MR technology in clinical trials, but also to the continuing development of modern, quantitative MR-based techniques, that have not as yet entered the clinical arena. The present report summarizes the conclusions of the 'EFNS Expert Panel of Neuroimaging of MS' on the application of conventional and non-conventional MR techniques to the clinical management of patients with MS. These guidelines are intended to assist in the use of conventional MRI for the diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of patients with MS. In addition, they should provide a foundation for the development of more widespread but rational clinical applications of non-conventional MR-based techniques in studies of MS patients.

To test this hypothesis, we measured brain regional serotonin synthesis, as indexed by PET and alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan trapping, in 10 patients who had made a high-lethality suicide attempt and 16 healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, suicide attempters had reduced normalized alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan trapping in orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. alpha-[C-11]Methyl-L-tryptophan trapping in these regions correlated negatively with suicide intent. Low serotonin synthesis in the prefrontal cortex might tower the threshold for suicidal behavior. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

Available treatment options and study data demonstrating the impact of these skeletal-related events (SREs) on the patient's quality of life are highlighted in this review. Methods: Studies were identified and researched through PubMed. Results: Pathologic fractures affect many aspects of a patient's quality of life. Many of these fractures do not heal properly without treatment and require rehabilitation to restore function. In addition, patients may have pain that is refractory to standard therapy. Furthermore, fractures negatively affect survival in patients with prostate cancer. Vertebral metastases may cause patients to have motor impairment, pain, and neurologic complications. Bisphosphonates are able to effectively reduce skeletal complications. Zoledronic acid significantly reduced the proportion of men who experienced at least one SRE over 2 years on study compared with placebo (p = 0.028). Zoledronic acid also demonstrated a significant 5-month delay in the median time to first SRE (p = 0.009). Moreover, men without pain at study entry had a 39% relative reduction in the incidence of skeletal complications. Conclusions: Bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer are associated with skeletal morbidity that may be refractory to treatment and can negatively affect quality of life. Zoledronic acid fulfills the need to reduce skeletal complications and should be considered in this patient population to delay the onset of these complications and improve pain control.

The goal of the present study is to determine how lesions involving the presumed cerebellar and pallidal recipient areas of the "motor" thalamus would alter the tremor and motor behavior of ten patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Tremor amplitude, power dispersion (a measure of sharpness of the power spectrum of tremor), and power distribution were quantified using a laser displacement sensor prior to, and a week after, VL thalamotomy. As well, the impact of surgery on tremor seen during movement was quantified in a manual-tracking (MT) task. Tremor-induced noise (a measure of the amount of tremor present during movement) and ERROR (difference between subject's performance and target) were quantified. Finally, bradykinesia was assessed with a rapid alternating movement (RAM) task. Duration, range, and amplitude irregularity of wrist pronation-supination cycles were computed. Both motor tasks were quantified using a highly sensitive forearm rotational sensor. Healthy age-matched control subjects were also tested. Magnetic resonance images with an integrated atlas of thalamic nuclei were used to confirm lesion location. Results show that the lesions were centered upon the posterior portion of the ventral lateral (VLp) nucleus of the thalamus, included the posterior part of the ventral lateral anterior nucleus (VLa), and extended posteriorly to encroach upon the most rostral sector of the sensory ventral posterior nucleus (VPLa). VL thalamotomy significantly decreased tremor amplitude in all cases. Power dispersion was increased significantly so that it became similar to that of control subjects. Changes in power distribution indicate that thalamotomy selectively targeted PD tremor oscillations. Tremor detected during the MT task was also markedly decreased, becoming similar to that of controls. Patients also showed significant decrease in ERROR during MT. RAM duration and range were not significantly modified by the surgery, and patients' performance remained impaired compared to healthy control subjects. Collectively, these results suggest that lesions involving the presumed "cerebellar" and "pallidal" recipient sectors of the motor thalamus do not worsen bradykinesia, suggesting that neural circuits other than the pallido-thalamo-cortical loop may be involved in slowness of movement in PD. A review of alternate pathways is presented.

In the present paper, we focus on the ability of subjects to transfer acquired stiffness patterns to other parts of the workspace and on the durability of stiffness adaptations. To explore the transfer of stiffness control, subjects were trained at the left of the workspace to resist the effects of a single-axis disturbance that was applied by a robotic device. Following training, they were tested for transfer at the right. One group of subjects experienced similar torques at the left and right of the workspace, whereas the other group of subjects experienced similar forces at the hand. Following the initial training at the left, the observed orientation of the hand-stiffness ellipse rotated in the direction of the disturbance. In tests at the right, transfer was observed only when the direction of disturbance resulted in torques that were similar to those experienced during training. The results thus suggest that under the conditions of this experiment stiffness control is acquired and transfers in a joint- or muscle-based system of coordinates. A second experiment assessed the durability of an acquired stiffness pattern. Subjects were trained on 2 consecutive days to resist a single-axis disturbance. On a third day, the direction of the disturbance was switched by 90 degrees. Substantial interference with the new adaptation was observed. This suggests that stiffness training results in durable changes to the neural signals that underlie stiffness control.

In the central nervous system (CNS), the Rho signaling pathway regulates the neuronal response to growth inhibitory proteins and regeneration of damaged axons, and Rho activation is also correlated with an increased susceptibility to apoptosis. To evaluate whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in changes in Rho activation in vulnerable regions of the brain, GTP-RhoA pull down assays were performed on rat cortical and hippocampal tissue homogenates obtained from 24 h to 3 days following lateral fluid percussion brain injury (FPI). Following FPI, a significantly increased RhoA activation was observed from 24 h to 3 days post-injury in the cortex and by 3 days in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the injury. We also detected activated RhoA in the cortex and hippocampus contralateral to the injury, without concomitant changes in total RhoA levels. To determine if immediate post-traumatic events such as seizures may activate Rho, we examined RhoA activation in the brains of rats with kainic acid-induced seizures. Severe seizures resulted in bilateral RhoA activation in the cortex and hippocampus.

Natriuretic peptides are implicated in normal pressure and volume homeostasis and in the defence against excessive increases in overload-related factors, vasopressive and cardiotoxic factors and their impact on the heart, blood vessels and brain. Genetic manipulation studies confirmed the importance of natriuretic peptides in these functions. Natriuretic peptides are metabolised by NPR-C (clearance receptors) and by enzymatic degradation by neutral endopeptidase. Natriuretic peptide levels (mainly brain natriuretic peptide) correlate with left ventricular hypertrophy and with the severity of heart failure, and are reduced by effective treatment, thus used as diagnostic and prognostic tools. Based on the multiple protective effects of natriuretic peptides, pharmacological therapy has been approved and includes potentiating natriuretic peptide levels by intravenous infusion or by inhibition of endogenous natriuretic peptide degradation. Because each approach has its limitations, the field remains open for improvement.

Glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier is essential to sustain brain energy metabolism and is accomplished by the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT1. To investigate alterations in brain glucose uptake in acute liver failure further, GLUT1 expression and [C-14]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake were measured in the brains of rats with hepatic devascularization. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed significant increases in steady-state levels of GLUT1 mRNA and protein in frontal cortex as early as 6 h following hepatic devascularization, (prior to the onset of brain edema and encephalopathy) which remained elevated at coma stages of encephalopathy. Expression of the astrocytic (45-kDa) and endothelial (55-kDa) forms of GLUT1 was increased as a result of hepatic devascularization. Exposure of cultured astrocytes to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of ammonia resulted in increased GLUT1 expression, suggesting that elevated ammonia levels are responsible for GLUT1 upregulation in ALF. Increased GLUT1 expression in ALF was selective, since expression of the neuronal glucose transporter GLUT3 and other glucose-regulated proteins (GRP-78 and GRP-94) was unaltered. [C-14]-2-deoxy-D-glucose autoradiography revealed increases in cerebral glucose uptake following the induction of GLUT1 in ALF. These results suggest that ammonia-induced increases of GLUT1 expression resulting in increased cerebral glucose uptake occur in ALF and could contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the neurological complications of this condition.

However, little is known about the capacity of controlling these signals. Specifically, it is unclear whether myocontrol, i.e., the control of myoelectric signals, obeys the same laws as motor control. Neurologically intact adult participants performed pointing tasks with EMG signals captured from the forehead or the hand in two modalities (sustained: stabilize the signal amplitude in the target; impulsion: produce an impulse and return to resting level). In the sustained modality, the time to reach the target (reach time) increased logarithmically with target amplitude, which is compatible with the predictions of Fitts' law. The rate of failure was not significantly affected by target amplitude. In the impulsion modality, the reach time and the rate of failure followed a bow-shaped pattern as a function of target amplitude. Stabilization time in the sustained modality followed a convex (bow-shaped) pattern for the forehead and a concave pattern for the hand. This was the only significant effect of electrode placement in this study. These findings suggest that myocontrol obeys laws that are distinct from those determining motor control, and that the muscular and intra-muscular synergies that produce EMG signals are specific of each pointing modality and target amplitude.

This paper introduces ways of creating customized neural models based on a fuzzy clustering of responses. Fuzzy-clustered neural network (FCNN) models are explored, leading to increases in accuracy. The information contained within FCNN models can also be applied to space mapping electromagnetic optimization. This optimization approach strives to combine the accuracy of fine models (such as finite elements) with the low cost of coarse models. These FCNN enhancements are demonstrated through a patch antenna test case.

Physiologically, melatonin is associated with T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokines, and its administration favours Th1 priming. In both normal and leukaemic mice, melatonin administration results in quantitative and functional enhancement of natural killer (NK) cells, whose role is to mediate defenses against virus-infected and cancer cells. Melatonin appears to regulate cell dynamics, including the proliferative and maturational stages of virtually all haemopoietic and immune cells lineages involved in host defense - not only NK cells but also T and B lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes - in both bone marrow and tissues. In particular, melatonin is a powerful antiapoptotic signal promoting the survival of normal granulocytes and B lymphocytes. In mice bearing mid-stage leukaemia, daily administration of melatonin results in a survival index of 30-40% vs. 0% in untreated mice. Thus, melatonin seems to have a fundamental role as a system regulator in haemopoiesis and immuno-enhancement, appears to be closely involved in several fundamental aspects of host defense and has the potential to be useful as an adjuvant tumour immunotherapeutic agent.

Both 5-HT and neurosteroids seem to play an important role in the pathophysiology of major depression. We have previously shown that a 7-d treatment with 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP drastically increases the spontaneous firing activity of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons in female rats. This study was thus undertaken to better characterize this modulation and to assess the effects of ganaxolone, a synthetic analogue of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP. Female rats received 50 mu g/kg.d of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP or ganaxolone for 3 and 7 days. Others received 3 alpha 5 alpha-THP concomitantly with the antiprogestin RU486 (50 mu g/kg.d, each), which was administered alone. Acute experiments were also carried Out with a single injection of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP (1 mu g/kg). Finally, both 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP and ganaxolone (50 mu g/kg.d) were administered along with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSR1) citalopram (10 mg/kg.d). In-vivo extracellular unitary recordings of 5-HT neurons from the DRN, revealed that 3a,5a-THP and ganaxolone increased their firing activity after 3 and 7 d of treatment. A 7-d treatment with RU486 had the same effect. Furthermore, an increase could be seen as soon as after 30-60 min following a single injection with 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP. Interestingly, both 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP and ganaxolone prevented the citalopram-induced reduction in firing activity after 3-d treatments. These data demonstrate the ability of 3 alpha,5 alpha-THP and ganaxolone to positively modulate the firing activity of DRN 5-HT neurons in female rats. Moreover, these results Suggest that these neuroactive steroids might represent interesting adjuvants in the treatment of mood disorders in female patients.

The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of Sotos syndrome in a consecutive series of patients with global developmental delay, which might modify our laboratory evaluation approach to this particular clinical situation. For a 10-year inclusive interval, the case records of all consecutive patients referred for global developmental delay in a single pediatric neurology practice were reviewed. Patients with macrocephaly were defined by an age- and gender-adjusted head circumference greater than or equal to the 98th percentile. Possible clinical factors associated with eventual diagnosis of Sotos syndrome in this group of macrocephalic children were tested with a two-tailed Fisher exact test. Of 261 children with global developmental delay, 18 (7%) had documented macrocephaly. Of these 18 children, 3 (17%) had an advanced bone age and were diagnosed with Sotos syndrome. In patients with global developmental delay and concomitant macrocephaly, Sotos syndrome is not uncommon. Assessment of bone age is a simple screening test for diagnosis of this entity and should be undertaken routinely in children with macrocephaly and global developmental delay even in the absence of other distinctive syndromic clinical features.

We assess treatment complications in the patients diagnosed during this screening program, Patients and Methods A total of 476,603 patients born during the screening period were eligible. Parents of 425,838 children (89%) agreed to participate in the 3-week screening, and 73% agreed to participate in the 6-month screening. Forty-five patients had neuroblastoma. We reviewed the medical and research charts for all patients diagnosed by screening. Follow-up was available from 8 to 13 years after screening. Results Forty-five patients were diagnosed by screening. All patients were treated according to the Pediatric Oncology Group recommendations of the time. All patients had surgery, and 29 patients received chemotherapy. No patient died from neuroblastoma. Eleven patients suffered complications from treatment. Two patients had life-threatening complications. Conclusion In view of the lack of impact of screening programs on neuroblastoma mortality, evidence that many of the tumors detected through screening can be observed without treatment and the serious complications that may arise from therapy, we do not support neuroblastoma screening programs for children.

Aplysia Mnk shares many conserved regions with vertebrate Mnk, including putative eukaryotic initiation factor 4G binding regions, activation loop phosphorylation sites, and a carboxy-terminal anchoring site for MAP kinases. As expected, purified Aplysia Mnk phosphorylated Aplysia eIF4E at a conserved carboxy-terminal serine and over-expression of Aplysia Mnk in sensory neurons led to increased phosphorylation of endogenous eIF4E. Over-expression of Aplysia Mnk led to strong decreases in cap-dependent translation, while generally sparing internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent translation. However, decreases in cap-dependent translation seen after expression of Aplysia Mnk could only be partly explained by increases in eIF4E phosphorylation. In Aplysia sensory neurons, phosphorylation of eIF4E is reduced during intermediate memory formation. However, we found that this physiological regulation of eIF4E phosphorylation was independent of changes in Aplysia Mnk phosphorylation. We propose that changes in eIF4E phosphorylation in Aplysia neurons are a consequence of changes in cap-dependent translation that are independent of regulation of Aplysia Mnk.

J	Benini, R; Avoli, M				Benini, R; Avoli, M			Altered inhibition in lateral amygdala networks in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							HORIZONTAL SLICE PREPARATION; CA1 PYRAMIDAL CELLS; IN-VITRO; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS; IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; RECIPROCAL CONNECTIONS; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS	Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that the amygdala is involved in limbic seizures observed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Here, we used simultaneous field and intracellular recordings from horizontal brain slices obtained from pilocarpine-treated rats and age-matched nonepileptic controls (NECs) to shed light on the electrophysiological changes that occur within the lateral nucleus ( LA) of the amygdala. No significant differences in LA neuronal intrinsic properties were observed between pilocarpine-treated and NEC tissue. However, spontaneous field activity could be recorded in the LA of 21% of pilocarpine- treated slices but never from NECs. At the intracellular level, this network activity was characterized by robust neuronal firing and was abolished by glutamatergic antagonists. In addition, we could identify in all pilocarpine-treated LA neurons: 1) large amplitude depolarizing postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and 2) a lower incidence of spontaneous hyperpolarizing PSPs as compared with NECs. Single-shock stimulation of LA networks in the presence of glutamatergic antagonists revealed a biphasic inhibitory PSP (IPSP) in both NECs and pilocarpine-treated tissue. The reversal potential of the early GABA A receptor - mediated component, but not of the late GABA B receptor mediated component, was significantly more depolarized in pilocarpine-treated slices. Furthermore, the peak conductance of both fast and late IPSP components had significantly lower values in pilocarpine-treated LA cells. Finally, paired-pulse stimulation protocols in the presence of glutamatergic antagonists revealed a less pronounced depression of the second IPSP in pilocarpine- treated slices compared with NECs. Altogether, these findings suggest that alterations in both pre- and postsynaptic inhibitory mechanisms contribute to synaptic hyperexcitability of LA networks in epileptic rats.

Increasing evidence indicates that these T cells are not exclusively detrimental but might also exert protective effects. We report for the first time that myelin-reactive T-cell clones from eight MS patients (6/19) and five healthy controls (4/11) produce leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the neuropoietic family of neurotrophins. In addition, T-cell clones specific for tetanus toxoid, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and monocytes, but not B cells, secreted LIF LIF-producing T lymphocytes and macrophages were also identified immunohistochemically in both active and chronic-active MS lesions. We further demonstrated dose-dependent protective effects of LIF on tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis of oligodendrocytes. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that peripheral and CNS-infiltrating T cells from MS patients produce LIF, a protective factor for oligodendrocytes. This study emphasizes that secretion of LIF may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of auto reactive T cells. (C) 2006 Wiley- Liss, Inc.

Despite the ectopic positions of different neuronal populations, the specificity of synaptic connections is maintained. The metabolic consequences of this form of neuropathology were examined in Reln(rl) mutant mice by quantitative measures of cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity, a mitochondrial enzyme essential for oxidative metabolism in neurons. Despite severe tissue disorganization but in line with the intact synaptic organization, the reeler mutation did not affect global metabolic activity of the laminated structures of the brain. CO activity, however, was altered in specific subregions of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and neocortex, as well as in septum and various brainstem (medial pontine, paramedial reticular, paragigantocellular reticular) regions anatomically related to these structures, attesting to large functional alterations in Reln(rl-orl) brain. Metabolic activity variations were also detected in the ventral tegmental area and ventral neostriatum of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. The results are discussed and compared to the regional CO variations found in other ataxic mice, in regard to the structural defects, the integrity of the connections, and the mutation-specific effects.

The purpose of this paper was to define the general efficacy of and morbidity associated with stereoelectroencephalography using modern methods of imaging and to particularize the risks related to specific lobes of the brain. Methods. All patients admitted to the Montreal Neurological Institute who had undergone either computerized tomography- or magnetic resonance imaging-guided electrode implantation by one surgeon (A.O.) were reviewed. The procedure was considered efficient if the obtained information was sufficient to make a decision either in support of or against surgery. Two hundred seventeen patients underwent 224 implantations with 3022 electrodes. Complications related to each lobe were as follows: temporal lobe, two abscesses (0.54%); frontal lobe, one abscess and three hematomas (1.4%); and occipital lobe, one hypointense lesion found 1 week after electrode explantation (2.6%). Significant risk factors associated with hematomas were implantation in the frontal lobe (p < 0.05) and the use of four or more implanted electrodes (p < 0.025). General complications included the following: 26 patients, psychiatric symptoms during monitoring; one patient, meningitis; four patients, scalp cellulitis; and two patients, hemiparesis during angiography in the early 1980s. One of these latter patients maintained a mild hemiparesis and represents the only case of permanent neurological sequela in the entire series. Data obtained during recordings supported an indication for surgery in 178 patients (79.5%), excluded a surgical option in 37 patients (16.5%), and were unsatisfactory in nine patients (4%). Thus, the overall efficacy as defined previously was 96%. Conclusions. Stereoelectroencephalography is an efficient procedure with low associated morbidity. Bilateral exploration of the temporal lobes has a morbidity rate of approximately 1%. A higher risk of hematomas occurs with the implantation of four or more electrodes in the frontal lobes.

Metabolic regulation of insulin gene expression enables the beta-cell to maintain adequate stores of intracellular insulin to sustain the secretory demand. Glucose is the major physiologic regulator of insulin gene expression; it coordinately controls the recruitment of transcription factors [e.g., pancreatic/duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1), mammalian homologue of avian MafA/L-Maf (MafA), Beta2/Neuro D (B2), the rate of transcription, and the stability of insulin mRNA. However, chronically elevated levels of glucose (glucotoxicity) and lipids (lipotoxicity) also contribute to the worsening of beta-cell function in type 2 diabetes, in part via inhibition of insulin gene expression. The mechanisms of glucotoxicity, which involve decreased binding activities of PDX-1 and MafA and increased activity of C/EBP beta, are mediated by high-glucose-induced generation of oxidative stress. On the other hand, lipotoxicity is mediated by de novo ceramide synthesis and involves inhibition of PDX-1 nuclear translocation and MafA gene expression. Glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity have common targets, which makes their combination particularly harmful to insulin gene expression and beta-cell function in type 2 diabetes.

The present experiment was conducted to examine compensation for one such perturbation-a palatal perturbation in the production of the fricative /s/. Subjects wore a specially designed electropalatographic (EPG) appliance with a buildup of acrylic over the alveolar ridge as well as a normal EPG palate. In this way, compensatory tongue positioning could be assessed during a period of target specific and intense practice and compared to nonperturbed conditions. Electropalatographic, acoustic, and perceptual analyses of productions of /asa/ elicited from nine speakers over the course of a one-hour practice period were conducted. Acoustic and perceptual results confirmed earlier findings, which showed improvement in production with a thick artificial palate in place over the practice period; the EPG data showed overall increased maximum contact as well as increased medial and posterior contact for speakers with the thick palate in place, but little change over time. Negative aftereffects were observed in the productions with the thin palate, indicating recalibration of sensorimotor processes in the face of the oral-articulatory perturbation. Findings are discussed with regard to the nature of adaptive articulatory skills. (c) 2006 Acoustical Society of America.

As part of a 10-year longitudinal study of youths with ADHD, the authors evaluated medication diversion or misuse at the last follow-up period. Method: Structured psychiatric interviews for diagnosis and a self-report questionnaire regarding medication use in medicated subjects with ADHD compared with controls without ADHD receiving psychotropics for non-ADHD treatment were employed. Results: Of 98 subjects receiving psychotropic medications (mean age of 20.8 +/- 5 years), 55 (56%) were ADHD subjects and 43 (44%) were controls receiving medications for other purposes. The authors found that 11% of the ADHD group reported selling their medications compared with no subjects in the control group (z = 0.00, p < .05). An additional 22% of the ADHD group reported misusing their medications compared with 5% of the control subjects (z = 1.7 p = .09) and that those with conduct or substance use disorders accounted for the misuse and diversion. A minority of subjects reported escalating their doses and concomitant use with alcohol and drugs. Conclusions: The data indicate that the majority of ADHD individuals, particularly those without conduct or substance use disorders, use their medications appropriately. The authors' findings also highlight the need to monitor medication use in ADHD individuals with conduct and/or substance use disorders and to carefully select agents with a low likelihood of diversion or misuse in this group.

These pulses afford optimal amplitude modulation, achieving uniform and highly selective profiles at any effective flip angle. In this paper, BASSI pulses are parameterized to obtain low RF energy pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) label pulses with minimal contamination of static spins outside the label region and highly selective PICORE/QUIPSS II saturation pulses allowing for small label gaps. They are compared to frequency off set corrected inversion (FOCI) label pulses and sinc saturation pulses in simulations and a phantom experiment. Drawing on the outstanding selectivity of bandwidth-modulated saturation pulses, a new noninvasive method to measure in vivo the contamination effects due to direct and indirect saturation of static spins by the label pulse is presented. In an in vivo study on four subjects, contamination effects in a QUIPSS II PASL implementation based on BASSI pulses are compared to those present in a state-of-the-art Q2TIPS sequence employing a FOCI label pulse. Residual contamination in the QUIPSS II/BASSI sequence is shown to be reduced by a factor of 3, compared to the Q2TIPS/FOCI sequence. In vivo human perfusion images obtained with a label gap of only 2 mm are presented.

Using a sample of 23 cetacean species we examine the relationship among six different measures of relative brain size, body size, and maximum diving duration. Unlike previous tests we include body size as a covariate and perform independent contrast analyses to control for phylogeny. We show that diving does not limit brain size in cetaceans and therefore provide no support for the dive constraint hypothesis. Instead, body size is the main predictor of maximum diving duration in cetaceans. Furthermore, our findings show that it is important to conduct robust tests Of evolutionary hypotheses by employing a variety of measures of the dependent variable, in this case, relative brain size.

Theories about the causes of DPNP are inextricably linked with the causes of diabetic neuropathies, yet most patients with such neuropathies do not experience pain. The factors that differentiate patients with pain from those without remain unknown and are the subject of much research. When choosing treatment for patients with DPNP, physicians are confronted with a myriad of choices, none of which has been shown to be effective for all patients. This article reviews the evidence for these treatments and attempts to guide physicians in choosing those treatments based on evidence from well-designed clinical trials to support their use. Two agents, duloxetine and pregabalin, are formally approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of DPNP.

Using subcellular fractionation, we isolated a fraction from rat embryonic day 18 brains enriched for structures that resemble amorphous collections of ribosomes. This fraction was enriched for the mRNA encoding beta-actin, an mRNA that is transported in dendrites and axons of developing neurons. Abundant protein components of this fraction, determined by tandem mass spectrometry, include ribosomal proteins, RNA-binding proteins, microtubule-associated proteins (including the motor protein dynein), and several proteins described only as potential open reading frames. The conjunction of RNA-binding proteins, transported mRNA, ribosomal machinery, and transporting motor proteins defines these structures as RNA granules. Expression of a subset of the identified proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons confirmed that proteins identified in the proteomics were present in neurites associated with ribosomes and mRNAs. Moreover many of the expressed proteins co-localized together. Time lapse video microscopy indicated that complexes containing one of these proteins, the DEAD box 3 helicase, migrated in dendrites of hippocampal neurons at the same speed as that reported for RNA granules. Although the speed of the granules was unchanged by activity or the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, but not activity, increased the proportion of moving granules. These studies define the isolation and composition of RNA granules expressed in developing brain.

Many studies of the relationships between brain serotonergic functions and affective disorders have been performed in different animal models. In this study, brain regional 5-HT synthesis was examined using the alpha-[C-14] methyl-(L)-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) autoradiographic method in a genetic rat model of depression, Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, and was compared to both the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats and the control Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The plasma concentration of free tryptophan in the FSL rats was not significantly different (p > 0.05; ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni correction) when compared to that of the FRL and SD rats. The FSL rats had significantly lower 5-HT synthesis (one sample two-tailed t-test on the ratio) than both the FRL and SD rats (the mean ratios were 0.78 +/- 0.12 and 0.73 +/- 0.15, respectively). Overall, the 5-HT synthesis in the FRL rats was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from that in the SD rats (one sample two-tailed t-test on the ratio and the mean ratio was 0.93 +/- 0.13). Studies of individual brain structures, such as the raphe nuclei and their many terminal areas, including the nucleus accumbens, cingulate and frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus revealed significant reductions (typically 25-50%) in 5-HT synthesis in the FSL rats compared to the non-depressive FRL and SD rats. These results suggest that significantly reduced 5-HT synthesis in the raphe nuclei and limbic areas in FSL rats may contribute to their depressive features. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Acute increases in extracellular glutamate levels have been detected in both experimental brain trauma models and in human patients, and can lead to over-stimulation of glutamate receptors, resulting in a cascade of excitotoxic-related mechanisms culminating in neuronal damage. These elevated levels of glutamate can be effectively controlled by the astrocytic glutamate transporters GLAST (EAAT1) and GLT-I (EAAT2). However, evidence indicate these transporters and splice variant are downregulated shortly following the insult, which then precipitates glutamate-mediated excitotoxic conditions. Lack of success with glutamate receptor antagonists as a potential source of clinical intervention treatment following TBI has resulted in the necessity for a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the process of excitotoxicity, including the function and regulation of glutamate transporters. Such new insight should improve the likelihood of development of novel avenues for therapeutic intervention following TBI. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a technique presented for the creation of a brain atlas of the basal ganglia and the thalamus derived from serial histological data. Photographs of coronal histological sections were digitized and anatomical structures were manually segmented. A slice-to-slice nonlinear registration technique was used to correct for spatial distortions introduced into the histological data set at the time of acquisition. Since the histological data were acquired without any anatomical reference (e.g., block-face imaging, post-mortem MR]), this registration technique was optimized to use an error metric which calculates a nonlinear transformation minimizing the mean distance between the segmented contours between adjacent pairs of slices in the data set. A voxel-by-voxel intensity correction field was also estimated for each slice to correct for lighting and staining inhomogencity. The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) histological volume can be viewed in transverse and sagittal directions in addition to the original coronal. Nonlinear transformations used to correct for spatial distortions of the histological data were applied to the segmented structure contours. These contours were then tessellated to create three-dimensional geometric objects representing the different anatomic regions in register with the histological volumes. This yields two alternate representations (one histological and one geometric) of the atlas. To register the atlas to a standard reference MR volume created from the average of 27 T1-weighted MR volumes, a pseudo-MRI was created by setting the intensity of each anatomical region defined in the geometric atlas to match the intensity of the corresponding region of the reference MR volume. This allowed the estimation of a 3D nonlinear transformation using a correlation based registration scheme to fit the atlas to the reference MRI. The result of this procedure is a contiguous 3D histological volume, a set of 3D objects defining the basal ganglia and thalamus, both of which are registered to a standard MRI data set, for use for neurosurgical planning.

Using them in combination has the potential to allow imaging with the spatial resolution of fMRI and the temporal resolution of EEG. However, although considerable data are available concerning their concordance in studies involving event-related potentials (ERPs), less is known about how well they, agree in epilepsy. To this end, 17 patients were selected from a database of 57 who had undergone an EEG-fMRI scanning session followed by a separate EEG session outside of the scanner. Spatiotemporal dipole modelling was compared with the peak and closest EEG-fMRI activations and deactivations. On average, the dipoles were 58.5 mm from the voxel with the highest positive t value and 32.5 mm from the nearest activated voxel. For deactivations, the corresponding values were 60.8 and 34.0 mm. These values are considerably higher than is generally observed with ERPs, probably as a result of the relatively widespread field, which can lead to artificially deep dipoles, and the occurrence of EEG-fMRI responses remote from the presumed focus of the epileptic activity. The results suggest that EEG and MEG inverse solutions for equivalent current dipole approaches should not be strongly constrained by EEG-fMRI results in epilepsy, and that the use of distributed source modelling will be a more appropriate way of combining EEG-FMRI results with source localisation techniques.

Several reports have suggested that wavelet processing of receptor kinetic data in the human brain can improve the SNR of parametric images of binding potential (1111). However, it is difficult to full), assess these reports because objective standards have not been developed to measure the tradeoff between accuracy (e.g. degradation of resolution) and precision. This paper employs a realistic simulation method that includes all major elements affecting image formation. The simulation was used to derive an ensemble of dynamic PET ligand (C-11-raclopride) experiments that was subjected to wavelet processing. A method for optimizing wavelet denoising is presented and used to analyze the simulated experiments. Using optimized wavelet denoising, SNR of the four-dimensional PET data increased by about a factor of two and SNR of three-dimensional BP maps increased by about a factor of 1.5. Analysis of the difference between the processed and unprocessed means for the 4D concentration data showed that more than 80% of voxels in the ensemble mean of the wavelet processed data deviated by less than 3%. These results show that a 1.5x increase in SNR can be achieved with little degradation of resolution. This corresponds to injecting about twice the radioactivity, a maneuver that is not possible in human studies without saturating the PET camera and/or exposing the subject to more than permitted radioactivity.

The objective was to document the test-retest and inter-rater reliability of the Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H), in a sample of individuals with myotonic dystrophy (DM1). Twenty-eight participants with myotonic dystrophy aged between 29 and 75 years (mean: 52.7) were recruited. The LIFE-H questionnaire was administered at three different occasions. The LIFE-H demonstrates high test-retest and inter-rater reliability (ICCs: 0.80-0.92) for the total score and subscores (daily activities and social roles). Moderate to high test-retest reliability (ICCs: 0.76-0.92) was found for most categories (8/10) of the LIFE-H. Similar results were obtained for inter-rater reliability (ICCs: 0.68-0.93). Moderate to high agreement using the Bland and Altman method was obtained for most categories. The LIFE-H, a measure of person-perceived social participation, demonstrates adequate test-retest and inter-rater reliability for clinical and research purposes in myotonic dystrophy.

In mesencephalic dopamine neurons, inhibition of the firing rate through activation of somatodendritic D2 receptors and blockade of neurotransmitter release through stimulation of terminal D2 receptors represent major roles of D2 autoreceptors. Recently, data obtained from D2L-deficient mice suggested that D2S acts as the preferential D2 autoreceptor. In the present study, we investigate whether this D2 isoform-specific autoreceptor function is linked to differences in the subcellular localization and/or signaling properties of the D2S and D2L using mesencephalic neurons transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged receptors. Our results show that EGFP-tagged D2S and D2L are localized to the axonal and somatodendritic compartments of mesencephalic neurons. In addition, we demonstrate that EGFP-tagged D2S and D2L regulate cellular excitability, neurotransmitter release and basal levels of intracellular calcium with similar effectiveness. Overall, our morphological and electrophysiological studies suggest that the major D2 autoreceptor function attributed to D2S is likely explained by the predominant expression of this isoform in dopamine neurons rather than by distinct subcellular localization and signaling properties of D2S and D2L.

More than 70 years ago, Fulton proposed a functional distinction between these two areas, coining the terms primary motor area for cortex in Brodmann area 4 and premotor area for cortex in Brodmann area 6. The parcellation of the cortical motor system has subsequently become more complex. Several nonprimary motor areas have been identified in the brain of the macaque monkey, and associations between anatomy and function in the human brain are being tested continuously using brain mapping techniques. In the present review, the authors discuss the unique properties of the primary motor area (M1), the dorsal portion of the premotor cortex (PMd), and the ventral portion of the premotor cortex (PMv). They end this review by discussing how the premotor areas influence M1.

We investigated distractibility in 14 smokers (7 females) with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and behavioral performance measures extracted from an auditory discrimination task requiring a choice reaction time response to short- and long-duration tones, both with and without embedded deviants. Nicotine gum (4 mg), administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, failed to counter deviant-elicited behavioral distraction (i.e., slower reaction times and increased response errors), and it did not influence the distracter-elicited mismatch negativity, the P300a, or the reorienting negativity ERP components reflecting acoustic change detection, involuntary attentional switching, and attentional reorienting, respectively.

It also acts as an agonist at 5-HT(1A) receptors, but has a lower potency than at the 5-HT(1B) sites. There is very little known about the mechanism by which anpirtoline influences regional 5-HT synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of acutely and chronically administered anpirtoline on 5-HT synthesis in the rat brain using the autoradiographic alpha-[(14)C] methyl-L-tryptophan method. In the acute study, anpirtoline (2.0 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before the tracer injection. The control rats were injected with the same volume of saline. In the chronic study, anpirtoline (2 mg/kg per day) was injected subcutaneously in saline once a day for 10 days. There were no significant differences between the plasma-free and total tryptophan concentrations between the anpirtoline treatment and the respective control groups. In the acute experiment, 5-HT synthesis rates in all of the brain areas investigated were significantly decreased by anpirtoline when compared to the saline-treated group. In the chronic anpirtoline experiment, 5-HT synthesis rates of almost all of the projection areas, as well as the raphe nuclei, were normalized or had a tendency to be normalized. These results suggest that it is likely that the terminal 5-HT(1B) receptors are involved in the regulation of 5-HT synthesis in the projection areas and that 5-HT synthesis, in the raphe, is likely influenced by anpirtoline's 5-HT(1A) and/or 5-HT(1B) agonistic properties.

A key issue is to determine how cognitive-emotional systems modulate the stress response. We sought to determine whether effortful and automatic processing were differentially associated with subsequent mood and cortisol levels during a stressful challenge. We examined this question by having clinically anxious, depressed, and control participants perform a modified spatial cueing task with supraliminal and masked pictorial stimuli during a stressful challenge and control condition. The stressful challenge, relative to the control condition, Lowered mood, but did not influence cortisol levels. In the full sample, disengagement from supraliminal dysphoric pictures was associated with subsequent mood ratings, whereas disengagement from masked pictures depicting threat was associated with subsequent cortisol levels. Effortful and automatic processing appears to regulate different aspects of the stress response. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently it has been introduced in psychiatry for the treatment of bipolar disorders, aggression, impulsivity, and resistant schizophrenia, although the mechanism by which VPA acts on these psychiatric diseases remains still unknown. Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the distinct effects of sodium-(Na-) and magnesium-valproate (Mg-VPA) in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and their interactions with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and excitatory amino acid responses. Materials and methods: In vivo electrophysiology and microiontophoresis techniques were used to attend these goals. Results: Both VPA salts decreased spontaneous neuronal firing activity in greater than 60% of recorded pyramidal neurons as well as potentiated GABA inhibitions. When injected at equal concentrations and currents, Mg-VPA blocked the excitatory responses induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) more frequently than Na-VPA. Both VPA salts equally blocked the excitatory responses of quisqualate and kainate. Conclusions: These data suggest that VPA salts significantly modulate the activity of excitatory amino acid at mPFC pyramidal neurons and this mechanism should explain the therapeutic effects of valproate in psychiatric diseases involving NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors at the mPFC level.

The alpha-[C-14]methyl-L-tryptophan autoradiographic method was used. We compared the synthesis in the buspirone treated OBX rats (administered either 10 mg/(kg day) (OBX-10) or 20mg/(kg day) (OBX-20)) to that of the saline treated OBX rats (OBX-SAL), and the sham operated rats (SHX) treated with saline. In addition, OBX-10 rats were compared to SHX rats treated with 10 mg/(kg day) (SHX-10) of buspirone. All treatments were carried out for 14 days. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Two weeks following the OBX or SHX procedures, the rats were assigned to the OBX-10, OBX-20, OBX-SAL, SHX-10. or SHX-SAL groups, respectively. The 5-HT synthesis rates R (pmol/(g/min)) were calculated from the trapping constant of a-[C-14]MTrp (K*; ml/(g min)) and the plasma concentration of the plasma non-protein-bound tryptophan (Cp; pmol/ml) using the lumped constant (LC) measured previously in the rat brain. There was no significant difference in the plasma free or total tryptophan among these groups. The overall synthesis in the OBX-10 group was not statistically different from the OBX-SAL group, but it was different from the OBX-20 and SHX-SAL groups. The OBX-20 rats had an overall significant reduction in 5-HT synthesis, when compared to the OBX-SAL group, but did not differ from the SHX-SAL group, which did not differ from the SHX-10 group. These results suggest that 10 mg/(kg day) of buspirone for 14 days in the OBX rats did not produce a significant alteration in 5-HT synthesis, but 20 mg/(kg day) for 14 days resulted in an overall significant reduction in brain 5-HT synthesis. The latter treatment brought the synthesis to the level found in the sham operated rats, i.e., a normal level. These results suggest that normalization (reduction to the level found in the SHX-SAL rats) of 5-HT synthesis in the OBX requires a greater dose of buspirone (20 mg/(kg day)) than that needed to produce a desensitization of the 5-HT1A receptors in the sham operated rats (10 mg/(kg day)). This probably indicates that 5-HT1A receptors have different functionality in the OBX rats than that found in the intact or sham operated rats. Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that 5-HT1A receptors mediate the antidepressant-like effect of 5-HT1A agonists, as the chronic 5-HTIA agonist treatment in the depression model known to be sensitive to antidepressants resulted in the normalization of 5-HT synthesis.

Tissue regression analysis correlates brain tissue type to measured metabolite levels, allowing for the extraction of "pure7' estimated grey and white matter compartment metabolite levels. We use this tissue analysis technique on a clinical dataset of first episode schizophrenic patients and matched controls to investigate the effect of brain tissue specificity on altered energy and membrane metabolism. In vivo brain spectra from two regions, (a) the fronto-temporal-striatal region and (b) the frontal-lobes, were analyzed from 12 first episode schizophrenic patients and 11 matched controls from a P-31 chemical shift imaging (CSI) study at 4 Tesla (T) field strength. Tissue regression analyses using voxels from each region were performed relating metabolite levels to tissue content, examining phosphorus metabolite levels in grey and white matter compartments. Compared with controls, the first episode schizophrenic patient group showed significantly increased adenosine triphosphate levels (13-ATP) in white matter and decreased B-ATP levels in grey matter in the fronto-temporal-striatal region. No significant metabolite level differences were found in grey or white matter compartments in the frontal cortex. Tissue regression analysis reveals grey and white matter specific aberrations in high-energy phosphates in first episode schizophrenia. Although past studies report inconsistent regional differences in high-energy phosphate levels in schizophrenia, the present analysissuggests more widespread differences that seem to be strongly related to tissue type. Our data suggest that differences in grey and white matter tissue content between past studies may account for some of the variance in the literature. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Accordingly, we investigated the effects of various dopaminergic receptor antagonists - including atypical antipsychotics that are prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia - in a model of toxicity using cultured hippocampal neurons, the hippocampus being a region of particular relevance to cognition. Results: Hippocampal cell death induced by deprivation of growth medium constituents was strongly blocked by drugs including antipsychotics (10(-10)- 10(-6) M) that display nM affinities for D-2 and/or D-4 receptors ( clozapine, haloperidol, (+/-)- sulpiride, domperidone, clozapine, risperidone, chlorpromazine, (+)- butaclamol and L-741,742). These effects were shared by some caspases inhibitors and were not accompanied by inhibition of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, (-)raclopride and remoxipride, two drugs that preferentially bind D-2 over D-4 receptors were ineffective, as well as the selective D-3 receptor antagonist U 99194. Interestingly, (-)- raclopride (10(-6) M) was able to block the neuroprotective effect of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (10(-6) M). Conclusion: Taken together, these data suggest that D2-like receptors, particularly the D-4 subtype, mediate the neuroprotective effects of antipsychotic drugs possibly through a ROS-independent, caspase-dependent mechanism.

Determining the neuroanatomical correlates of this relatively stable individual trait of general intelligence has proved difficult, particularly in the rapidly developing brains of children and adolescents. Here we demonstrate that the trajectory of change in the thickness of the cerebral cortex, rather than cortical thickness itself, is most closely related to level of intelligence. Using a longitudinal design, we find a marked developmental shift from a predominantly negative correlation between intelligence and cortical thickness in early childhood to a positive correlation in late childhood and beyond. Additionally, level of intelligence is associated with the trajectory of cortical development, primarily in frontal regions implicated in the maturation of intelligent activity(4,5).

We compared patients meeting BPD criteria (17 =24), with and without histories of CSA, with normal controls (it = 12) on the results of challenges with meta-chlorphenylpiperazine (m-CPP), pyridostigmine and clonidine. No differences were found between abused and non-abused patients with BPD. These results do not support the hypothesis that CSA is directly related to neurobiological abnormalities in BPD.

To examine the role of synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation in the structural development of axonal projections during the formation of the topographic retinotectal projection, we coexpressed cytosolic fluorescent protein (FP) and FP-tagged synaptophysin (SYP) in small numbers of retinal ganglion cells in living albino Xenopus laevis tadpoles to reveal the distribution and dynamics of presynaptic sites within labeled retinotectal axons. Two-photon time-lapse observations followed by quantitative analysis of tagged SYP levels at individual synapses demonstrated the time course of synaptogenesis: increases in presynaptic punctum intensity are detectable within minutes of punctum emergence and continue over many hours. Puncta lifetimes correlate with their intensities. Furthermore, we found that axon arbor dynamics are affected by synaptic contacts. Axon branches retract past faintly labeled puncta but are locally stabilized at intensely labeled SYP puncta. Visual stimulation for 4 h enhanced the stability of the arbor at intense presynaptic puncta while concurrently inducing the retraction of exploratory branches with only faintly labeled or no synaptic sites.

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study, the authors examined the safety and efficacy of oral teriflunomide in multiple sclerosis ( MS) with relapses. Methods: Patients (n = 179) with relapsing-remitting MS (n = 157) or secondary progressive MS with relapses (n = 22) were randomized to receive placebo, teriflunomide 7 mg/day, or teriflunomide 14 mg/day for 36 weeks. MRI brain scans were performed every 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was the number of combined unique active lesions per MRI scan. Secondary endpoints included MRI-defined disease burden, relapse frequency, and disability increase. Results: The median number of combined unique active lesions per scan was 0.5, 0.2, and 0.3 in the placebo, teriflunomide 7 mg/day (p < 0.03 vs placebo), and teriflunomide 14 mg/day (p < 0.01 vs placebo) groups during the 36-week double-blind treatment phase. Teriflunomide-treated patients also had significantly fewer T1 enhancing lesions per scan, new or enlarging T2 lesions per scan, and new T2 lesions. Patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg/day had significantly reduced T2 disease burden. Teriflunomide treatment resulted in trends toward a lower annualized relapse rate and fewer relapsing patients ( 14 mg/day only) vs placebo. Significantly fewer patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg/day vs placebo demonstrated disability increase. Treatment was well tolerated; numbers of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in all treatment groups. Conclusion: Oral teriflunomide was effective in reducing MRI lesions and was well tolerated in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis.

Recent studies have shown that some of these abilities also extend to those who have lost their sight later in life. It is not clear, however, what mechanisms underlie these abilities. Here, we examined cortical activation using positron emission tomography in late-onset blind participants during a free-field auditory localization task. Even though no behavioral enhancements were observed in this testing condition relative to sighted controls, the results revealed that the occipital cortex was nonetheless activated during task execution. We conclude that late-onset blind individuals do manifest cerebral reorganization, although its functional relevance to the task is less clear.

The neural correlates of this fear are not well understood. In this experiment, we investigated the relation between serotonin receptor binding and mRNA expression and fearful behavior in amygdala-kindled rats. Rats received either 100 kindling stimulations or sham stimulations, and their fear behavior was subsequently assessed in an unfamiliar open field. Then, the rats were sacrificed and 5-HT transporter binding, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor binding, and 5-HT1A mRNA expression in several brain regions was assessed. The kindled rats were significantly more fearful in the open field than the sham-stimulated rats. They also had significantly more 5-HT1A receptor binding and mRNA expression in the dentate gyrus than the sham-simulated rats, and these increases in 5-HT1A receptor binding and mRNA expression were significantly correlated to the increases in fear. There were no significant differences between the kindled and sham-stimulated rats in 5-HT transporter binding or 5-HT2A receptor binding. These results suggest that alterations in 5-HT1A receptors in the dentate gyrus may play a role-in the expression of kindled fear. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

While performing paired intracellular and field potential recordings from rat neocortical slices superfused with medium containing 4-aminopyridine + GABA receptor antagonists, we identified: (i) epileptiform discharges characterized by concomitant field oscillations (amplitude = 2.6-6.4 mV) and intracellular depolarizations as well as (ii) smaller amplitude (0.3-1.3 mV) field epileptiform events that were not associated with any intracellular activity. By placing an additional extracellular recording electrode into adjacent slices, we discovered that large amplitude, epileptiform discharges were generated concomitant to those seen in the first slice at the field potential level only. In addition, We found in these slices small amplitude, field discharges that were synchronous with those recorded intracellularly in the original slice. Analysis of the changes in field potential amplitude over space demonstrated that this parameter was reduced by approximately 60% when the recording electrode was moved from the slice generating the epileptiform activity to the bathing medium and further decreased in a quasi-linear mode when recordings were obtained from an adjacent slice. fit conclusion, these observations indicate that brain slices can, under appropriate conditions. produce field potentials that are of amplitude sufficient for being recorded from other slices in the tissue chamber. These findings suggest that caution should be taken in assuming that field potential activity seen in an in vitro brain slice is generated within the recorded tissue. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Src family kinases (SFKs) are one of the most studied groups of tyrosine kinases and can mediate a variety of signalling pathways. However, little is known about the expression of SFKs in human term placenta and their implication in trophoblast differentiation. Therefore, we examined the expression profile of SFK members over time in culture and their implication in differentiation. In vitro, freshly isolated cytotrophoblast cells, cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), spontaneously aggregate and fuse to form multinucleated cells that resemble phenotypically mature syncytiotrophoblasts, that concomitantly produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human placental lactogen (hPL). In this study, we showed that trophoblasts expressed all SFK members and some of them are expressed as different splice variants. Moreover, using real-time PCR, this study showed two different expression profiles of SFKs in human trophoblasts during culture. In addition, the protein level and phosphorylation status of Src were evaluated using specific antibodies. Src was rapidly phosphorylated at Tyr-416 and dephosphorylated at Tyr-527 after FBS addition. Surprisingly, inhibition of SFKs by 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP2) or herbimycin A had different effects on trophoblast differentiation. While herbimycin A inhibited morphological and hormonal differentiation, PP2 stimulated hormonal differentiation and inhibited cell adhesion and spreading with no effect on cell fusion. In summary, this study showed that SFKs play different roles in trophoblast differentiation, probably depending on SFK members activated. Thus, this study increases our knowledge and understanding of pathology related to impaired trophoblast differentiation such as pre-eclampsia and trophoblast neoplasm.

Retrospective analysis of a prospectively followed cohort. Objective. Long-term evaluation of patients with anterior stabilization for dislocations of the cervical spine. Setting. Level 1 trauma center. Summary of Background Data. Anterior stabilization of unstable cervical spine injuries is gaining popularity. However, the method of open reduction is controversial. Methods. Forty-one consecutive patients with unstable dislocations/subluxations of the subaxial cervical spine were included. Closed reduction was attempted in all patients using Gardner-Wells traction. If this failed, an anterior open reduction was performed. Tricortical iliac crest autograft and anterior plating was used. Patients were assessed for: 1) rate of successful reduction and stabilization using only the anterior surgical approach; and 2) complications and long-term clinical and radiologic outcome. Results. Two of eight (25%) anterior open reductions failed requiring posterior surgery. One of these patients had associated pedicle fractures with horizontal rotation of the lateral masses. All grafts had healed successfully at the most recent follow-up visit. Moderate neck discomfort was found in 5 of 41 patients. Significant neurologic improvement was observed. Conclusions. Most subluxations/dislocations of the subaxial cervical spine can be reduced using Gardner-Wells traction and successfully stabilized with anterior surgery alone. If closed reduction fails, anterior open reduction is successful in the majority of cases.

However, the binding properties of DA receptors and transporters in pig brain have not been characterized in vitro. Therefore, the saturation binding parameters of [H-3]SCH 23390 for DA D-1 receptors and [H-3]raclopride for DA D-2/3 receptors were measured by quantitative autoradiography in cryostat sections from brain of groups of 8 week old and adult female Gottingen minipigs. The magnitudes of B-max and K-d for these ligands were similar in young and old pigs, and were close to those reported for rat and human brain. Furthermore, gradients in the concentrations of D-1 and D-2/3 sites in striatum measured in vitro agreed with earlier findings in PET studies. However, the dopamine transporter (DAT) ligand [H-3]GBR12935 did not bind in pig brain cryostat sections. Whereas the tropane derivative [I-125]RTI-55 labeled serotonin transporters (serotonin transporter (SERT)) in pig brain, use of the same ligand under conditions specific for DAT, revealed a pattern of binding similar to that observed for SERT conditions. Parallel studies revealed the presence of DAT in rat and ferret brain. The distribution volume (V-d) of the selective DAT ligand [C-11]NS2214 ([C-11]Brasofensine) was mapped in groups of normal and MPTP-lesioned Gottingen miniature pigs. The in vivo pattern of V-d matched the distribution of SERT in vitro, and did not differ between the normal pigs and the lesioned animals with documented 60% DA depletions. However, the pattern of specific binding of the selective noradrenaline transporter ligand (S,S)-[C-11]MeNER in a single Landrace pig showed that, of the three monoamine transporters, only DAT could not be detected in pig brain. We conclude that the pig is a suitable model for PET studies of DA D-1 and D-2/3 binding sites, which are fully developed on the eighth postnatal week. However, well-characterized piperazine and tropane radioligands failed to recognize DAT in pig brain; the two tropane radioligands lacked pharmacological specificity for DAT and SERT in pig brain in vitro and in vivo.

J	Li, T; Paudel, HK				Li, T; Paudel, HK			Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta phosphorylates Alzheimer's disease-specific Ser(396) of microtubule-associated protein tau by a sequential mechanism	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; TRANSGENIC MICE; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; BETA-CATENIN; IN-VIVO; KINASE; SITES; CDK5; SUBSTRATE; ACTIVATOR	Phosphorylation of tau on S-396 was suggested to be a key step in the development of neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease brain [Bramblett, G. T., Goedert, M., Jacks, R., Merrick, S. E., Trojanowski, J. Q., and Lee, V. M.-Y. (1993) Neuron 10, 1089-1099]. GSK3 beta phosphorylates Ser(396) of tau in the brain by a mechanism which is not clear. In this study, when HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with tau and GSK3 beta, GSK3 beta co-immunoprecipitated with tau and phosphorylated tau on S-202. T-231, S-396, and S-400 but not on S-262, S-235, and S-404. Blocking phosphorylation on T-231, S-235, S-396, S-400, or S-404 did not prevent the subsequent phosphorylation on S-202 by GSK3 beta. These data suggest that GSK3 beta directly phosphorylates tau on S202 (without requiring prephosphorylation). However, preventing phosphorylation on S-235, S-400, and S-404 prevented GSK3 beta-dependent phosphorylation of T-231, S-396, and S-400, respectively. This indicates that phosphorylation of T-231, S-396, and S-400 by GSK3 beta depends on a previous phosphorylation of S-235, S-400, and S-404, respectively. To examine S-396 phosphorylation, we analyzed phosphorylation of S-396, S-400, and S-404. Blocking phosphorylation of S-404 prevented the subsequent GSK3 beta-dependent phosphorylation of both S-400 and S-396. When phosphorylation of S-404 was allowed but S-400 blocked, GSK3 beta failed to phosphorylate S-396. Thus, GSK3 beta phosphorylates S-396 by a two-step mechanism. In the first step, GSK3 beta phosphorylates S-400 of previously S-404-phosphorylated tau. This event primes tau for second-step phosphorylation of S-396 by GSK3 beta. We conclude that GSK3 beta phosphorylates tau directly at S-202 but requires the previous phosphorylation on S-235 to phosphorylate T-231. Phosphorylation of S-396, on the other hand, occurs sequentially. Once a priming kinase phosphorylates S-404, GSK3 beta sequentially phosphorylates S-400 and then S-396.

Phosphorylation of S-202 occurs without priming. Phosphorylation of T-231, on the other hand, requires priming phosphorylation of S-235. Similarly, priming phosphorylation of S-404 is essential for the sequential phosphorylation of S-400 and S-396 by GSK3 beta. The priming kinase that phosphorylates tau at S-235 and S-404 in the brain is not known. In this study, we find that in HEK-293 cells cotransfected with tau, GSK3 beta, and Cdk5, Cdk5 phosphorylates tau at S-202, S-235, and S-404. S-235 phosphorylation enhances GSK3 beta-catalyzed T-231 phosphorylation. Similarly, Cdk5 by phosphorylating S-404 stimulates phosphorylation of S-400 and S-396 by GSK3 beta. These data indicate that Cdk5 primes tau for GSK3 beta in intact cells. To evaluate if Cdk5 primes tau for GSK3 beta in mammalian brain, we examined localizations of Cdk5, tau, and GSK3 beta in rat brain. We also analyzed the interaction of Cdk5 with tau and GSK3 beta in brain microtubules. We found that Cdk5, GSK3 beta, and tau are virtually colocalized in rat brain cortex. When bovine brain microtubules are analyzed by FPLC gel filtration, Cdk5, GSK3 beta, and tau coelute within an similar to 450 kDa complex. From the fractions containing the similar to 450 kDa complex, tau, Cdk5, and GSK3 beta co-immunoprecipitate with each other. In HEK-293 cells transfected with tau, Cdk5, and GSK3 beta in different combinations, tau binds to Cdk5 in a manner independent of GSK3 beta and to GSK3 beta in a manner independent of Cdk5. However, Cdk5 and GSK3 beta bind to each other only in the presence of tau, suggesting that tau connects Cdk5 and GSK3 beta. Our results suggest that in the brain, tau, Cdk5, and GSK3 beta are components of an similar to 450 kDa complex. Within the complex, Cdk5 phosphorylates tau at S-235 and primes it for phosphorylation of T-231 by GSK3 beta. Similarly, Cdk5 by phosphorylating tau at S-404 primes tau for a sequential phosphorylation of S-400 and S-396 by GSK3 beta.

The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined visuomotor hand conditional activity and the locus of the frontal eye field as defined by a standard task, on a subject-by-subject basis, to clarify their location and reveal relationships between the pattern of local morphology and functional activity. The results demonstrate that visuomotor hand conditional activity and the frontal eye field lie within distinct parts of the superior precentral sulcus, revealing an organization of the human premotor cortex consistent with that observed in experimental studies in the monkey.

Our goal was to determine whether treatment with metoprolol reduces the risk of syncope in patients with vasovagal syncope. Methods and Results - The multicenter Prevention of Syncope Trial (POST) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double- blind, trial designed to assess the effects of metoprolol in vasovagal syncope over a 1-year treatment period. Two prespecified analyses included the relationships of age and initial tilt-test results to any benefit from metoprolol. All patients had > 2 syncopal spells and a positive tilt test. Randomization was stratified according to ages < 42 and >= 42 years. Patients received either metoprolol or matching placebo at highest-tolerated doses from 25 to 200 mg daily. The main outcome measure was the first recurrence of syncope. A total of 208 patients (mean age 42 +/- 18 years) with a median of 9 syncopal spells over a median of 11 years were randomized, 108 to receive metoprolol and 100 to the placebo group. There were 75 patients with >= 1 recurrence of syncope. The likelihood of recurrent syncope was not significantly different between groups. Neither the age of the patient nor the need for isoproterenol to produce a positive tilt test predicted subsequent significant benefit from metoprolol. Conclusions - Metoprolol was not effective in preventing vasovagal syncope in the study population.

The mesocortical dopamine (DA) system is an important afferent modulator of this region, is highly stress sensitive and frequently shows functional hemispheric asymmetry. Postnatal handling stimulation facilitates development of cortical asymmetry and is also associated with optimal HPA axis regulation. The present study examines the poorly understood role of the mesocortical DA system in regulating HPA axis function in adult rats which were handled (H) or nonhandled (NH) postnatally. in the first experiment, unilateral intra-IL cortex injection of the DA (D1/D2) antagonist alpha-flupenthixol into either hemisphere significantly exaggerated the restraint stress-induced increases in plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone and corticosterone in NH rats. in H rats, the same effect was lateralized to the right IL cortex. In a second experiment, post mortem neurochemical analysis of DAergic measures in the IL cortex was conducted in H and NH animals following either acute or repeated (5 times) restraint stress. DAergic measures in the right IL cortex were significantly correlated with reduced stress hormone activation in both H and NH rats, especially in repeatedly restrained rats. However, while H rats showed a significant rightward shift in DA metabolism with repeated stress experience, NH rats shifted DA metabolism to the left. It is suggested that, during stress, mesocortical DA release normally acts in an adaptive, negative feedback capacity preventing excessive HPA activation and, with repeated stress, the right IL cortex is particularly important in this capacity. As well, the selective enhancement of DA metabolism in the right IL cortex of H rats may underlie, in part, their typically superior ability to adapt to stress and constrain HPA activity.

Recent data show that principal neurons of the entorhinal cortex display persistent firing at graded firing rates that can be shifted up or down in response to brief excitatory or inhibitory stimuli. Here, we present a model of a potential mechanism for graded firing. Our multicompartmental model provides stable plateau firing generated by a nonspecific calcium-sensitive cationic (CAN) current. Sustained firing is insensitive to small variations in Ca2+ concentration in a neutral zone. However, both high and low Ca2+ levels alter firing rates. Specifically, increases in persistent firing rate are triggered only during high levels of calcium, while decreases in rate occur in the presence of low levels of calcium. The model is consistent with detailed experimental observations and provides a mechanism for maintenance of memory-related activity in individual neurons.

The Cochrane Collaboration and bicycle helmets. Accid. Anal. Prevent. 37(3), 569-573]. He begins by criticizing the scientific evidence that helmets protect against head and brain injuries. The crux of his argument is that in theory helmets should not protect all mechanisms of brain injury and, therefore, all epidemiological research showing they are beneficial in a variety of circumstances is invalid. This short communication identifies some of the questionable elements in Curnow's assertions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because of the diversity of conceptual and methodological approaches, the extent of their independent contribution has been difficult to establish. Here, we review conceptual background and empirical evidence investigating roles of traits in suicidal behaviors. We selected original studies published in English in MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases, focusing on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or suicide completions, and using standardized personality measures. Most studies focused on investigating risk for suicide attempts. Hopelessness, neuroticism, and extroversion hold the most promise in relation to risk screening across all three suicidal behaviors. More research is needed regarding aggression, impulsivity, anger, irritability, hostility, and anxiety. Selected personality traits may be useful markers of suicide risk. Future research needs to establish their contributions in relation to environmental and genetic variation in different gender, age, and ethnocultural groups.

J	Imbeault, K; Withington, DE; Varin, F				Imbeault, K; Withington, DE; Varin, F			Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a 0.1 mg/kg dose of cisatracurium besylate in children during N2O/O-2/propofol anesthesia	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							INFORMATION CRITERION; OPIOID ANESTHESIA; ATRACURIUM; INFANTS; HALOTHANE; INFUSION; 51W89; PHARMACOLOGY; ELIMINATION; PROPOFOL	We studied the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cisatracurium in 9 children (mean weight, 17.1 kg) aged 1-6 yr (mean, 3.75 yr) during propofol-nitrous oxide anesthesia. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed. Venous samples were taken before injection of a 0.1 mg/kg dose of cisatracurium and then at 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Cisatracurium plasma concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Onset time was 2.5 +/- 0.8 min, recovery to 25% of baseline twitch height was 37.6 +/- 10.2 min, and the 25%-75% recovery index was 10.9 +/- 3.7 min. Distribution and elimination half-lives were 3.5 +/- 0.9 min and 22.9 +/- 4.5 min, respectively. Steady-state volume of distribution (0.207 +/- 0.031 L/kg) and total body clearance (6.8 +/- 0.7 mL/min/kg) were significantly larger than those published for adults. Pharmacodynamic results were comparable to those obtained in pediatric studies during halothane or opioid anesthesia with the exception of a longer recovery to 25% baseline. Although the plasma-effect compartment equilibration rate constant was twofold faster (0.115 +/- 0.025 min(-1)) than that published for cisatracurium in adults, the effect compartment concentration corresponding to 50% block was similar (129 +/- 27 ng/mL).

The authors used blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the processing words (10 per period; compared with scrambled words) and nonspeech human vocal sounds (10 per period; compared with environmental sounds) during propofol anesthesia. Methods: Seven healthy subjects were tested. Propofol was given by a computer-controlled pump to obtain stable plasma concentrations. Data were acquired during awake baseline, sedation (propofol concentration in arterial plasma: 0.64 +/- 0.13 mu g/ml; mean +/- SD), general anesthesia (4.62 +/- 0.57 mu g/ml), and recovery. Subjects were asked to memorize the words. Results: During all periods including anesthesia, the sounds conditions combined elicited significantly greater activations than silence bilaterally in primary auditory cortices (Heschl gyrus) and adjacent regions within the planum temporale. During sedation and anesthesia, however, the magnitude of the activations was reduced by 40-50% (P < 0.05). Furthermore, anesthesia abolished voice-specific activations seen bilaterally in the superior temporal sulcus during the other periods as well as word-specific activations bilaterally in the Heschl gyrus, planum temporale, and superior temporal gyrus. However, scrambled words paradoxically elicited significantly more activation than normal words bilaterally in planum temporale during anesthesia. Recognition the next day occurred only for words presented during baseline plus recovery and was correlated (P < 0.01) with activity in right and left planum temporale. Conclusions: The authors conclude that during anesthesia, the primary and association auditory cortices remain responsive to complex auditory stimuli, but in a nonspecific way such that the ability for higher-level analysis is lost.

Twenty unmedicated AD/HD children participated to these experiments. Fifteen children were randomly assigned to the Experimental (EXP) group whereas the other five children were randomly assigned to the Control (CON) group. Only subjects in the EXP group underwent NFT. EXP subjects were trained to enhance the amplitude of the SMR (12-15 Hz) and beta 1 activity (15-18 Hz), and decrease the amplitude of theta activity (4-7 Hz). Subjects from both groups were scanned one week before the beginning of NFT (Time 1) and 1 week after the end of NFT (Time 2), while they performed a "Counting Stroop" task (Experiment 1) and a Go/No-Go task (Experiment 2). At Time 1, in both groups, the Counting Stroop task was associated with significant activation in the left superior parietal lobule. For the Go/No-Go task, no significant activity was detected in the EXP and CON groups. At Time 2, in both groups, the Counting Stroop task was associated with significant activation of the left superior parietal lobule. This time, however, there were significant loci of activation, in the EXP group, in the right ACC, left caudate nucleus, and left substantia nigra. No such activation loci were seen in CON subjects. For the Go/No-Go task, significant loci of activation were noted, in the EXP group, in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, right ACcd, left thalamus, left caudate nucleus, and left substantia nigra. No significant activation of these brain regions was measured in CON subjects. These results suggest that NFT has the capacity to functionally normalize the brain systems mediating selective attention and response inhibition in AD/HD children.

However, it is only recently that one has identified two subtypes of G-protein-coupled receptors, namely CB1 and CB2-receptors, which mediate the numerous effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and other cannabinoids. Logically, the existence of cannabinoid-receptors implies that endogenous ligands for these receptors (endocannabinoids) exist and exert a physiological role. Hence, arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) and sn-2 arachidonoylglycerol, the first two endocannabinoids identified, are formed from plasma membrane phospholipids and act as CB1 and/or CB2 agonists. The presence of both CB1 and CB2-receptors in the rat heart is noteworthy. This endogenous cardiac cannabinoid system is involved in several phenomena associated with cardioprotective effects. The reduction in infarct size following myocardial ischemia, observed in rats exposed to either LPS or heat stress 24 hours before, is abolished in the presence of a CB1-receptor antagonist. Endocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids, the latter through either CB1 or CB2-receptors, exert direct cardioprotective effects in rat isolated hearts. The ability of cannabinoids to reduce infarct size has been confirmed in vivo in anesthetized mice and rats. This latter effect appears to be mediated through CB2-receptors. Thus, the endogenous cardiac cannabinoid system, through activation of CB2-receptors. appears to be an important mechanism of protection against myocardial ischemia.

Apoptosis is commonly observed in the reperfused myocardial infarcted heart, and recent findings suggest the existence of apoptosis in MDD. Cytokines, which are released by ischemic myocardium and which may induce apoptosis, have been proposed as a possible cause for MDD. Myocardial infarction was produced in anesthetized rats by a 40-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 72 hours of reperfusion. Determination of apoptosis was done in the amygdala, hippocampus and vermis of MI and Sham rats treated or not with pentoxyfilline (PTX), a cytokine synthesis inhibitor (10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal). Compared to Sham rats, the amygdala of MI rats showed significantly reduced PI3K activity, increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-3 activity, and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling)-positive cells. The effect of MI on apoptosis was completely reversed in presence of PTX. No statistical difference was observed in the hippocampus and the vermis in the different groups for any of the biochemical measurements. These results indicated that MI induce apoptosis in amygdala by a cytokine-sensitive mechanism and may explain the MDD observed following myocardial infarction.

The mechanism of action of these lipids is thought to be primarily dependent on their specific plasma membrane receptors belonging to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Increasing evidence suggests the existence of a functional intracellular GPCR population. It has been proposed that immediate effects are mediated via cell surface receptors whereas long-term responses are dependent upon intracellular receptor effects. Indeed. receptors for PAF. LPA. and PGE, (specifically EP1, EP3, and EP4) localize at the cell nucleus of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells of new born pigs. rat hepatocytes, and cells overexpressing each receptor. Stimulation of isolated nuclei with these lipids reveals biological functions including transcriptional regulation of major genes, namely c-fos, cylooxygenase-2, and endothelial as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase. In the present review. we shall focus on the nuclear localization and signaling of GPCRs recognizing PGE(2), PAF, and LPA phospholipids as ligands. Mechanisms on how nuclear PGE(2). PAF and LPA receptors activate gene transcription and nuclear localization pathways are presented.

In daily life, such abilities are frequently of the non-literal type, which require more cognitive resources to be processed. Since these resources tend to diminish with age, this study seeks to identify a possible effect of age on non-literal language abilities. Forty young and 40 older adults of two different education levels were compared on their non-literal and literal language abilities. Results suggest that age does not affect the processing of non-literal language but could affect some preliminary components of the task, thought to require more cognitive resources. This study does not provide direct evidence to suggest that elderly participants experience specific difficulties in processing non-literal language.

By using successive dilutions presented in a staircase protocol, we determined olfactory thresholds for PEA in 36 healthy participants (18 women) in both an upright and a supine position. Participants had a significantly greater olfactory sensitivity when tested in an upright than a supine position, with no significant differences between the sexes. This preliminary study sets the stage for further work on the interaction between olfactory functions and our biology. The implications for olfactory neuroimaging studies are discussed.

(EOCZ) contains anethole (42%) and estragole (46%), two isomers that share some chemical structural similarities with capsaicin. The present study investigated the cardiovascular effects of EOCZ and the role of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerve fibres in the mediation of these effects in anaesthetized rats. Intravenous bolus injection of EOCZ (1-20 mg/kg) elicited dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia that were immediate and transient. Similar responses were also observed with anethole and estragole (both at 10 mg/kg). After cervical bivagotomy or perineural treatment of both cervical vagus nerves with capsaicin (250 mg/mL) to selectively block the conduction of sensory C-fibres, both cardiovascular responses to EOCZ (10 mg/kg) were abolished. Like capsaicin, an epigastric retrograde intra-arterial injection of EOCZ (10 mg/kg, i.a.) into the femoral artery elicited a monophasic hypotensive response. This reflex response was blocked by either neonatal pretreatment with capsaicin (50 mg/kg, s.c.) or intrathecal injection of the substance P receptor antagonist RP 67580 (7.8 nmol, at the spinal level L5-L6), suggesting that it is mediated exclusively by substance P-containing primary afferent fibres. The cardiovascular responses to EOCZ (10 mg/kg, i.v.) were also significantly reduced by the selective vallinoid TPRV1 receptor antagonist capsazepine (1 mg/kg, i.v.). It is concluded that i.v. administration of EOCZ in anaesthetized rats elicits a capsaicin-like bradycardic and depressor reflex, which appears to be mediated by the activation of vallinoid TPRV1 receptors located on vagal sensory nerves. Like capsaicin, i.a. injection of EOCZ induces a spinally mediated sensory reflex.

Constituents of both the innate and adaptive immune systems are potential contributors to this process. Endogenous (microglia) and infiltrating (macrophages, dendritic cells) constituents of the innate immune system serve as sensors of events occurring within the CNS; their response to such events underlies the extent of their interaction (chemoattraction, antigen presentation) with the components of the adaptive immune system (alpha beta T cells, B cells) and ultimately the extent of the resultant inflammatory response. Constituents of both the innate and adaptive immune system can serve as effectors of tissue injury. The susceptibility of specific types of neural cells to injury further reflects the extent to which immune mediators modulate expression of crucial molecules (adhesion molecules, receptors) involved in effector-target interactions. Ongoing interactions between the constituents of the immune system themselves and between these constituents and neural cells are important determinants of disease recurrence and/or progression. Conversely, these interactions also impact on the mechanisms involved in target protection and repair. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Seizures from 20 patients with bitemporal implantation were classified as unilateral or bilateral and analyzed with ICA. During the period preceding bilateral activity, correlation coefficients were calculated between ICA components having ictal activity during the unilateral seizure phase (early ICA components) and every channel of the original EEG. ICA components were classified as unilateral if the correlation was > 0.2 exclusively with channels in one hemisphere; and bilateral if both hemispheres were involved. Results: One hundred twenty-three seizures were analyzed. Thirty-two percent of visually classified unilateral seizures and 64% of bilateral seizures (during the unilateral phase) had bilateral ICA components. The proportion of early ICA components that were bilateral and the proportion of channels contralateral to the visually identified seizure with correlation higher than 0.2 with at least one early ICA component were significantly lower in seizures that stayed unilateral than in seizures that later became bilateral by visual inspection (11 and 10%, respectively, in unilateral seizures; 33 and 28% in bilateral seizures; P=0.001). Conclusions: In patients with bitemporal epilepsy, approximately 20% of the components extracted using ICA have a bitemporal distribution even at the time when the seizures are apparently unilateral. The presence of early contralateral ictal activity is more frequent and extensive in Seizures that later become evidently bilateral. Significance: Minimal contralateral seizure activity is present even when the discharge appears unilateral and this is more frequent in seizures which later spread to the contralateral temporal lobe.

Methods: Sway was measured during stance in 13 patients before and after 5 min of isometric dorsal neck muscle contractions and after recovery, pre- and post-physiotherapy, using a force platform. Amplitude and median frequency of neck muscle EMG were calculated during the contracting period. After each stance trial, patients gave a subjective score of sway. Results: Pre-treatment, seven patients showed EMG signs of fatigue (increases in amplitude, decreases in median frequency) and increases in sway (eyes closed) after contractions. The other patients showed neither fatigue nor increased sway. Post-treatment, no signs of fatigue or imbalance were recorded in all patients, for the same levels of muscle contraction. Conclusions: As in normal human subjects, increases in sway are associated with signs of neck muscle fatigue in some whiplash injury patients. Physiotherapy decreases the susceptibility to fatigue of neck muscles and is an effective choice of treatment of subjective instability and sway. Significance: This study demonstrates a pathophysiological link between neck muscle fatigue and impaired postural control, and also that physiotherapy can relieve symptoms and signs of impaired neck muscle function by reducing muscle fatigability.

Using data from a prospective, 3-year study of a clinical sample (N = 96), hierarchical regression analyses indicated that perfectionism, assessed by the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (Weissman AN, Beek AT. Development and validation of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale: a preliminary investigation. Paper presented at the 86th annual convention of the American Psychological Association, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; 1978), is distinguished from major depression and neuroticism for its relations to depressive symptoms and interpersonal maladjustment 3 years later. Drawing from the model of Dunkley et al (J Couns Psychol 2000;47:437-53), path analysis indicated that Dysfunctional Attitude Scale perfectionism was related to depressive symptoms 3 years later through a number of persistent maladaptive tendencies, including negative social interactions, avoidant coping, and negative perceptions of social support.

A randomised trial investigated the efficacy and tolerability of rivastigmine, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase ( AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE), and donepezil, an AChE- selective inhibitor, in patients with AD over a 2- year period. This retrospective analysis investigated whether younger and older patients showed differential tolerability and efficacy responses to cholinesterase inhibitor treatment. Methods: For the current analysis, patients were divided according to age at baseline: those aged < 75 years and those aged >= 75 years. Efficacy measures were the Severe Impairment Battery ( SIB), Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI), Global Deterioration Scale ( GDS), Mini- Mental State Examination ( MMSE) and the AD Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living scale ( ADCS- ADL). Changes in efficacy parameters and adverse event frequencies were calculated for rivastigmine and donepeziltreated patients in both age groups. Exploratory analyses were also conducted on SIB, ADCS- ADL and NPI in patients who consented to pharmacogenetic testing at baseline. Genotyping sof the apolipoprotein E ( APOE) epsilon 4 allele and the BuChE K- variant was conducted using the TaqMan assay. Main efficacy analyses were based on an intent- to- treat last observation carried forward ( ITT- LOCF) population. Results: Of the 994 patients who received the study drug, 362 ( 36.4%) were younger than 75 years and 632 ( 63.6%) were aged 75 years or over. Rivastigmine provided significant benefits in younger patients compared with donepezil on the NPI- 10, NPI- 12, NPI- D, GDS and ADCS- ADL ( all p < 0.05, ITT- LOCF). With the exception of the NPI- D in favour of donepezil ( p < 0.05, ITT- LOCF), no significant treatment differences were observed in older patients. Younger patients with two wild- type BuChE alleles had a significantly greater response to rivastigmine than donepezil on the ADCS- ADL ( p < 0.01, ITT- LOCF) and SIB ( p < 0.05, ITT- LOCF). The most common adverse events were nausea and vomiting and these were more frequent in rivastigmine- treated patients. Conclusion: In this sub group analysis, patients younger than 75 years of age showed greater treatment responses to rivastigmine than donepezil. Analysis of response by BuChE genotype suggests that this differential effect may be due to the inhibition of BuChE, in addition to AChE, by rivastigmine.

Recent studies have shown that several small, non-neural peptides possess neurotrophic activity and exert beneficial effects on nervous system function in experimental and clinical diabetes. Two of these, C-peptide and islet neogenesis-associated protein peptide, are derived from pancreatic proteins and use related signal transduction mechanisms. Derivatives of erythropoietin possess similar properties in the nervous system. As a group, these peptides are of increasing interest as leads to potential new approaches in the treatment of diabetes-associated neuropathies and other neurodegenerative conditions. This review addresses the recent advances made with these peptides in the context of diabetic neuropathy, and highlights similarities and differences in their mechanisms of action from the perspective of combination therapy.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis whether seizure outcome after removal of cavernous malformations may be related to the extent of resection of surrounding hemosiderin-stained brain tissue. Methods: In this retrospective study, 31 consecutive patients with pharmacotherapy-refractory epilepsy due to a cavernous malformation were included. In all patients, cavernomas were resected, and all patients underwent pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We grouped patients according to MRI findings (hemosiderin completely removed versus not/partially removed) and compared seizure outcome (as assessed by the Engel Outcome Classification score) between the two groups. Results: Three years after resection of cavernomas, patients in whom hemosiderin-stained brain tissue had been removed completely had a better chance for a favorable long-term seizure outcome compared with those with detectable postoperative hemosiderin (p = 0.037). Conclusions: Our study suggests that complete removal of cavernoma-surrounding hemosiderin-stained brain tissue may improve epileptic outcome after resection of cavernous malformations.

To assess the involvement of excitatory drive onto inhibitory interneurons in this epileptiform activity, we examined changes in spontaneous and minimally evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs and eEPSCs) in CA1 interneurons in stratum oriens/alveus (O/A) and stratum radiatum (RAD) in rat hippocampal slices after KA treatment. The frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs and the amplitude of eEPSCs were unchanged in O/A interneurons, but the EPSC kinetics were significantly slower. These changes appear to be due to altered kinetics and voltage-dependent properties of the NMDA component of EPSCs in O/A interneurons. In contrast, sEPSCs and eEPSCs in RAD interneurons did not change after KA treatment. The distinct changes in excitatory synaptic activity in interneurons differentially involved in feedback (O/A) versus feedforward (RAD) inhibition suggest a cell type-specific reorganization of excitatory synapses after KA treatment. These modifications in excitatory input to interneurons could contribute to the maintenance of inhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells after KA treatment, or may also create network conditions favourable to epileptiform activity.

Impairment of oxidative metabolism is a pathogenetic mechanism underlying neuronal death in many chronic neurodegenerative diseases as well as in Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE), a disorder induced by thiamine deficiency (TD). To identify functional pathways that lead to neuronal damage in this disorder, we have examined gene expression changes in the vulnerable thalamus and inferior colliculus of TD rats using Affymetrix Rat Genome GeneChip analysis in combination with gene ontology and functional categorization assessment utilizing the NetAffx GO Mining Tool. Of the 15 927 transcripts analysed, 125 in thalamus and 141 in inferior colliculus were more abundantly expressed in TD rats compared with control animals. In both regions, the major functional categories of transcripts that were increased in abundance after TD were those associated with inflammation (similar to 33%), stress (similar to 20%), cell death and repair (similar to 26%), and metabolic perturbation (similar to 19%), together constituting similar to 98% of all transcripts up-regulated. These changes occurred against a background of neuronal cell loss and reactive astro- and microgliosis in both structures. Our results indicate that (i) TD produces changes in gene expression that are consistent with the observed dysfunction and pathology, and (ii) similar alterations in expression occur in thalamus and inferior colliculus, brain regions previously considered to differ in pathology. These findings provide important new insight into processes responsible for lesion development in TD, and possibly WE.

We therefore examined whether the stretch-inhibited cation (SIC) channels of MNCs can mediate calcium influx. Whole-cell recordings were made in MNCs isolated from the supraoptic nuclei of adult rats. Measurements of reversal potentials in different solutions revealed that the current induced by a suction-evoked decrease in cell volume (I-SIC) displays a selectivity sequence for monovalent cations of K+ > Cs+ > Na+ > NMDG(+). The permeability of SIC channels to Ca2+, relative to Na+, was similar to 5. In the presence of physiological concentrations of external Na+ and K+, the amplitude of inward I-SIC was reduced dose-dependently by external Ca2+ with an IC50 of 4.9 mm. This was not due to reduced suction-evoked volume changes or to an accumulation of [Ca2+](i). Confocal imaging of cytoplasmic Calcium Green-1 fluorescence revealed that activation of I-SIC significantly increases [Ca2+](i) in physiological solutions. This effect is absent in Ca2+-free solution, or when Gd3+ (300 mu m) is added to Ca2+-containing solution. Part of this effect is inhibited in the presence of dantrolene (10 mu m) and heparin (4 mg/mL), suggesting that release from intracellular Ca2+ stores participates in suction-evoked Ca2+ signalling. These observations indicate that SIC channels are highly permeable to Ca2+, mediate significant Ca2+ entry and release of Ca2+ from internal stores under conditions when the volume of MNCs is decreased.

Currently available drugs are effective for treatment of the disease or latent infection, but may cause serious adverse effects. Methods: The authors reviewed the literature for side effects of five first-line antituberculous medications (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin). Incidence of the major side effects were compiled with particular attention to the incidence of isoniazid hepatotoxicity. Results: Hepatotoxicity to isoniazid is a serious problem. Although overall incidence may be decreasing, incidence averaged 9.2 per 1000 patients who were compliant, in multiple studies, with a case fatality rate of 4.7%. The incidence is higher with increasing age. Other serious adverse effects include dermatological, gastrointestinal, hypersensitivity, neurological, haematological and renal reactions. They can lead to drug discontinuation (in up to 10% of patients) or even more serious morbidity or mortality. Conclusions: Side effects to antituberculosis drugs are common, and include hepatitis, cutaneous reactions, gastrointestinal intolerance, haematological reactions and renal failure. These adverse effects must be recognised early, to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

Little is known about the etiology of this heterogeneous group of diseases despite the fact they constitute the major cause of death by disease among this population. Because of its relatively high prevalence, most of the work done in pediatric oncogenetics has been focused on leukemias, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although it is now well accepted that genetic variation plays a significant role in determining individual's cancer susceptibility, few studies have explored genetic susceptibility to childhood leukemia with respect to common polymorphisms. The biochemical and genetic mechanisms contributing to cancer susceptibility are numerous and can be grouped into broad categories: (1) cellular growth and differentiation, (2) DNA replication and repair, (3) metabolism of carcinogens (4) apoptosis, (5) oxidative stress response and (6) cell cycle. To evaluate whether candidate genes in these pathways are involved in childhood leukemogenesis, we conducted case-control studies. We showed that leukemogenesis in children may be associated with DNA variants in some of these genes and that the combination of genotypes seems to be more predictive of risk than either of them independently. We also observed that, at least at some loci, the parental genetics might be important in predicting the risk of cancer in this pediatric model of a complex disease. Taken together, these results indicate that the investigation of a single enzyme and/or a single genotype might not be sufficient to explain the etiology of childhood leukemia because of the complexity of the environment and that of the inter-individual variability in cancer susceptibility.

J	Long, H; Cameron, S; Yu, L; Rao, Y				Long, H; Cameron, S; Yu, L; Rao, Y			De novo GMP synthesis is required for axon guidance in Drosophila	GENETICS			English	Article							VISUAL-SYSTEM; GLIAL-CELLS; NEURONAL MORPHOGENESIS; MYCOPHENOLIC-ACID; RETINAL AXONS; RHO GTPASES; GENE; MELANOGASTER; SYNTHETASE; PURINE	Guanine nucleotides are key players in mediating growth-cone signaling (hiring neural development. The supply of cellular guanine nucleotides in animals can be achieved via the de novo Synthesis and salvage pathways. The de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides is required for lymphocyte proliferation in animals. Whether the de novo synthesis pathway is essential for air), other cellular processes, however, remains unknown. In a search for genes required for the establishment of neuronal connectivity in the fly visual system, we identify the burgundy (bur) gene its an essential player in photoreceptor axon guidance. The bur gene encodes the only GMP synthetase in Drosophila that. catalyzes the final reaction of A novo GMP synthesis. Loss of bur causes severe defects in axonal fasciculation, retinotopy, and growth-cone morphology, but does not affect photoreceptor differentiation or retinal patterning. Similar defects were observed when the raspberry (ras) gene, encoding for inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase catalyzing the IMP-to-XMP conversion in GMP de novo synthesis, was mutated. Our study thus provides the first in vivo evidence to support an essential and specific role for de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides in axon guidance.

Two main different and complementary source models have emerged: equivalent current dipoles (ECD) and distributed linear (DL) models. While ECD models remain highly popular since they provide an easy way to interpret the solutions, DL models (also referred to as imaging techniques) are known to be more realistic and flexible. In this paper, we show how those two representations of the brain electromagnetic activity can be cast into a common general framework yielding an optimal description and estimation of the EEG sources. From this extended source mixing model, we derive a hybrid approach whose key aspect is the separation between temporal and spatial characteristics of brain activity, which allows to dramatically reduce the number of DL model parameters. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the sources, as a temporal invariant map, is estimated using the entire time window data, allowing to significantly enhance the information available about the spatial aspect of the EEG inverse problem. A Bayesian framework is introduced to incorporate distinct temporal and spatial constraints on the solution and to estimate both parameters and hyperparameters of the model. Using simulated EEG data, the proposed inverse approach is evaluated and compared with standard distributed methods using both classical criteria and ROC curves.

Recent work on BAM has improved network performance in relation to noisy recall and the number of spurious attractors, but at the cost of an increase in BAM complexity. In all cases, the networks can only recall bipolar stimuli and, thus, are of limited use for grey-level pattern recall. In this paper, we introduce a new bidirectional heteroassociative memory model that uses a simple self-convergent iterative learning rule and a new nonlinear output function. As a result, the model can learn online without being subject to overlearning. Our simulation results show that this new model causes fewer spurious attractors when compared to others popular BAM networks, for a comparable performance in terms of tolerance to noise and storage capacity. In addition, the novel output function enables it to learn and recall grey-level patterns in a bidirectional way.

J	Nerguizian, C; Despins, C; Affes, S				Nerguizian, C; Despins, C; Affes, S			Geolocation in mines with an impulse response fingerprinting technique and neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						indoor geolocation; underground mine; fingerprinting technique; radio propagation parameters; artificial neural network	SYSTEMS	The location of people, mobile terminals and equipment is highly desirable for operational enhancements in the mining industry. In an indoor environment such as a mine, the multipath caused by reflection, diffraction and diffusion on the rough sidewall surfaces, and the non-line of sight (NLOS) due to the blockage of the shortest direct path between transmitter and receiver are the main sources of range measurement errors. Unreliable measurements of location metrics such as received signal strengths (RSS), angles of arrival (AOA) and times of arrival (TOA) or time differences of arrival (TDOA), result in the deterioration of the positioning performance. Hence, alternatives to the traditional parametric geolocation techniques have to be considered. In this paper, we present a novel method for mobile station location using wideband channel measurement results applied to an artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed system, the Wide Band Neural Network-Locate (WBNN-Locate), learns off-line the location 'signatures' from the extracted location-dependent features of the measured channel impulse responses for line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) situations. It then matches on-line the observation received from a mobile station against the learned set of 'signatures' to accurately locate its position. The location accuracy of the proposed system, applied in an underground mine, has been found to be 2 meters for 90% and 80% of trained and untrained data, respectively. Moreover, the proposed system may also be applicable to any other indoor situation and particularly in confined environments with characteristics similar to those of a mine (e.g. rough sidewalls surface).

The stimulatory effects of EPO are mediated through the activation of its receptors, EPO receptors (EPORs). The objective of this study is to determine whether EPORs are expressed in biopsy specimens of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Eighteen biopsy specimens were studied after obtaining Institutional Review Board-approved consent. Standard immunohistochemistry techniques were utilized. Expression of EPORs was present in 16 out of 18 (88.9%) specimens. The intensity (qualitative) and the frequency (semiquantitative) of EPORs expression showed a statistically significant correlation (P= 0.00379). Statistical analysis was performed to determine whether EPORs expression is related to other parameters such as age, FIGO stage, histologic grade, and hemoglobin levels. Only age showed a statistically significant correlation with EPORs frequency of expression (P= 0.00878). Currently, work is in progress in our laboratory to study the radiobiologic effects of EPO on the radiation response of cultured cancer cell lines in vitro.

Cerebral blood vessels at the surface and within the brain are surrounded by nerve fibers that originate, respectively, from peripheral nerve ganglia and intrinsic brain neurons. Although of different origin and targeting distinct vascular beds, these "perivascular nerves" fulfill similar roles related to cerebrovascular functions, a major one being to regulate their tone and, therein, brain perfusion. This utmost function, which underlies the signals used in functional neuroimaging techniques and which can be jeopardized in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and migraine headache, is thus regulated at several levels. Recently, new insights into our understanding of how neural input regulate cerebrovascular tone resulted in the rediscovery of the functional "neurovascular unit." These remarkable advances suggest that neuron-driven changes in vascular tone result from interactions that involve all components of the neurovascular unit, transducing neuronal signals into vasomotor responses not only through direct interaction between neurons and vessels but also indirectly via the perivascular astrocytes. Neurovascular coupling is thus determined by chemical signals released from activated perivascular nerves and astrocytes that alter vascular tone to locally adjust perfusion to the spatial and temporal changes in brain activity.

Up-regulation of HO-1 in rat astroglia has been shown to facilitate iron sequestration by the mitochondrial compartment. To determine whether HO-1 induction promotes mitochondrial oxidative stress, assays for 8-epiPGF(2 alpha) (ELISA), protein carbonyls (ELISA) and 8-OHdG (HPLC-EC) were used to quantify oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, respectively, in mitochondrial fractions and whole-cell compartments derived from cultured rat astroglia engineered to overexpress human (h) HO-1 by transient transfection. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and the MTT assay, and cell proliferation was determined by [H-3] thymidine incorporation and total cell counts. In rat astrocytes, hHO-1 over-expression (x3 days) resulted in significant oxidative damage to mitochondrial lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, partial growth arrest, and increased cell death. These effects were attenuated by incubation with 1 mu M tin mesoporphyrin, a competitive HO inhibitor, or the iron chelator, deferoxamine. Up-regulation of HO-1 engenders oxidative mitochondrial injury in cultured rat astroglia. Heme-derived ferrous iron and carbon monoxide (CO) may mediate the oxidative modification of mitochondrial lipids, proteins and nucleic acids in these cells. Glial HO-1 hyperactivity may contribute to cellular oxidative stress, pathological iron deposition, and bioenergetic failure characteristic of degenerating and inflamed neural tissues and may constitute a rational target for therapeutic intervention in these conditions.

However, the new target may be part of a bigger family, for which we have more screening data. Collaborative filtering or, more generally, multi-task learning, is a machine learning approach that improves the generalization performance of an algorithm by using information from related tasks as an inductive bias. We use collaborative filtering techniques for building predictive models that link multiple targets to multiple examples. The more commonalities between the targets, the better the multi-target model that can be built. We show an example of a multi-target neural network that can use family information to produce a predictive model of an undersampled target. We evaluate JRank, a kernel-based method designed for collaborative filtering. We show their performance on compound prioritization for an HTS campaign and the underlying shared representation between targets. JRank outperformed the neural network both in the single- and multi-target models.

Methods: A search of the American National Library of Medicine's PubMed up to November 12, 2004, was performed. Twenty-four studies could be kept for analysis. Results: Regional anesthesia reduced the number of transfused patients for total hip replacement (P = 0.0009) and spinal fusion (P = 0.04). A reduction of measured blood loss that did not lead to a reduction in the number of transfused patients was also found for fractured hip surgery (P < 0.0001), lumbar disk surgery (P = 0.01), peripheral vascular surgery (P = 0.03), retropubic prostatectomy (P = 0.02), cesarean section (P < 0.0001), and bowel surgery (P = 0.0008). In summary neuraxial blocks have a clear and definite effect on surgical blood loss, but this effect do not usually lead to a reduction in the number of transfused patients except for patients undergoing total hip replacement and spinal fusion.

The negative consequences of substance abuse in schizophrenia are well documented, but the etiology of this comorbid condition remains unknown. According to the affect regulation model, schizophrenia patients abuse drugs in order to cope with their negative affects. Supporting the model, clinical Studies have shown that dual-diagnosis patients have less blunting of affect and that they experience more negative affect. We hypothesized that patients with a history of substance use would have increased cerebral activations in response to aversive stimuli when compared to abstinent patients. Method: Schizophrenia patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with (SCZ-SU group; N = 12) and without (SCZ group; N = 11) a current or past substance use disorder (alcohol, cannabis, and/or LSD). Diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV criteria. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), patients were scanned during passive viewing of emotionally negative pictures (International Affective Picture System). Data were gathered from September 2001 to December 2003. Results: Subjectively, the emotional experience induced by viewing the negative pictures was rated significantly higher in the SCZ-SU group than in the SCZ group (p = .008). Neurally, in the SCZ-SU group, significant loci of activation were identified in the right medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area [BA] 10), left medial prefrontal cortex (BA 10), right orbitofrontal cortex (BA 47), and left amygdala. No significant loci of activation were observed in the SCZ group. Conclusions: These results suggest that the functioning of the medial prefrontal cortex, thought to be impaired in patients with prominent negative symptoms, is more preserved in dual-diagnosis schizophrenia. This relative preservation could be primary or secondary to substance use.

Myelin-associated inhibitory proteins activate rho GTPase in responsive neurons. Rho kinase (ROCK) has been implicated as a critical rho effector in this pathway due to the ability of the pharmacological inhibitor Y-27632 to circumvent myelin-dependent inhibition. Y-27632, however, inhibits the activity of additional kinases. Using three independent approaches, we provide direct evidence that ROCKII is activated in response to the myelin-associated inhibitor Nogo. We demonstrate that Nogo treatment enhances ROCKII translocation to the cellular membrane in PC12 cells and enhances ROCKII kinase activity towards an in vitro substrate. In addition, Nogo treatment enhances phosphorylation of myosin light chain II, a known ROCK substrate. Further, we demonstrate that primary dorsal root ganglia neurons can be rendered insensitive to the inhibitory effects of myelin via infection with dominant negative ROCK. Together these data provide direct evidence for a rho-ROCK-myosin light chain-II signaling cascade in response to myelin-associated inhibitors.

The actual mechanism of somatodendritic dopamine release has remained controversial. Here we established for the first time a rat primary neuron culture model to investigate this phenomenon and use it to study the mechanism under conditions of non-stimulated spontaneous firing (1-2 Hz). We found that we can selectively measure somatodendritic dopamine release by lowering extracellular calcium to 0.5 mM, thus confirming the previously established differential calcium sensitivity of somatodendritic and terminal release. Dopamine release measured under these conditions was dependent on firing activity and independent of reverse transport through the plasma membrane. We found that treatment with botulinum neurotoxins A and B strongly reduced somatodendritic dopamine release, thus demonstrating the requirement for SNARE proteins SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin. Our work is the first to provide such direct and unambiguous evidence for the involvement of an exocytotic mechanism in basal spontaneous somatodendritic dopamine release.

Methods: A total of 122 consecutive patients with MRI diagnosis of MCD (53 males, age range 1-58 years) were included in the study. Hippocampal measurements were made on 1-3 mm coronal T1-weighted MRIs and compared with MRIs of normal controls. Results: A total of 39 patients had focal cortical dysplasia, 5 had hemimegalencephaly, 5 had lissencephaly-agyria-pachygyria, 11 had SLH, 11 had PNH, 12 had bilateral contiguous PNH, 5 had schizencephaly, and 34 had polymicrogyria. The frequency of hippocampal abnormalities in these patients with MCD was 29.5%. A small hippocampus was present in all types of MCD. Only patients with lissencephaly and SLH had an enlarged hippocampus. Abnormalities in hippocampal rotation and shape were present in all types of MCD; however, these predominated in PNH. None of the patients with lissencephaly-agyria-pachygyria or SLH had hyperintense signal on T2 or FLAIR images or abnormal hippocampal internal architecture. Conclusion: A small hippocampus was present in all types of MCD; however, the classic MRI characteristics of hippocampal sclerosis were often lacking. Abnormal enlargement of the hippocampus was associated with only diffuse MCD due to abnormal neuronal migration (lissencephaly-agyriapachygyria and SLH).

J	Moore, SW; Kennedy, TE				Moore, SW; Kennedy, TE			Protein kinase A regulates the sensitivity of spinal commissural axon turning to netrin-1 but does not switch between chemoattraction and chemorepulsion	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						gradient; motility; chemotropism; cAMP; axon guidance; spinal cord	ADENOSINE A2B RECEPTOR; GROWTH-CONE ATTRACTION; GUIDANCE; DCC; EXPRESSION; REPULSION; MECHANISM; UNC-5; ACTIVATION; INHIBITORS	Bifunctional axon guidance cues have been grouped into two classes depending on whether changes in intracellular cAMP or cGMP switch the response of the growth cone between attraction and repulsion. According to this model, axons respond to netrin-1, a group I guidance cue, as a chemoattractant when cAMP levels are high in the growth cone but switch and are repelled when the intraneuronal concentration of cAMP is low. The model is complicated by the proposal that cAMP-dependent kinase, protein kinase A ( PKA), functions as a downstream effector for several guidance cues, including netrin-1, suggesting a close inter-relationship between guidance cue signal transduction and mechanisms regulating the switch between attraction and repulsion. Here, we examine possible interactions between netrin-1-mediated axon guidance and cAMP signaling in embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons. We report that netrin-1 does not alter the concentration of cAMP or PKA activity in these neurons across a wide range of netrin-1 concentrations and time points after application, leading us to conclude that netrin-1 does not regulate PKA in these cells. In contrast to the cyclic nucleotide switch model, we report that, despite inhibiting PKA, embryonic spinal commissural axons were always attracted to netrin-1 and never repelled. Instead, manipulating PKA regulated the sensitivity of chemoattraction to netrin-1: PKA inhibition reduced, and PKA activation increased, the distance over which axons turn toward a source of netrin-1. These findings indicate that the mechanisms underlying cyclic nucleotide-regulated switching are separable from the signal transduction mechanisms required for chemoattraction to netrin-1.

Recently, however, an increasing number of studies have implicated a third element in plasticity; the perisynaptic glial cell. originally glial cells were thought to be important for metabolic maintenance and support of the nervous system. However, work in the past decade has clearly demonstrated active involvement of glia in stability and overall nervous system function as well as synaptic plasticity. Through specific modulation of glial cell function, a wide variety of roles for glia in synaptic plasticity have been uncovered. Furthermore, interesting circumstantial evidence Suggests a glial involvement in Multiple other types of plasticity. We will discuss recent advances in neuron-glial interactions that take place during synaptic plasticity and explore different plasticity phenomena in which glial cells may be involved.

BRAIN; PET	The discovery of the Law of Conservation of Energy in the 1840s had consequences for psychological theory. Does the process of thinking involve a novel form of energy that is not recognized by physical science? E. L. Youmans ( 1821 - 1887) argued that "mental operations are dependent upon material changes in the nervous system." Kurd Lasswitz ( 1848 - 1910) introduced the term "psychophysical energy," based upon the electrical activity of the brain. At the beginning of the twentieth century Alfred Lehmann ( 1858 - 1921) claimed that intense mental effort leads to a net increase in oxygen utilization and regarded this as evidence of a specific psychic energy. His views were adopted and extended by Hans Berger ( 1873 - 1941). F. G. Benedict ( 1870 - 1957), drawing upon extensive experience with balance experiments conducted on humans in large-scale respiration calorimeters, concluded that mental effort probably had no effect upon the brain's metabolism. Modern approaches to the problem make use of PET imaging, which detects local changes in glucose utilization by the brain during cognitive activity.

Materials and Methods: After baseline history, physical examination and urodynamic assessment BTA was injected (5 IU/kg body weight, maximum 300 IU) at 10 to 30 sites. Clinical and urodynamic assessment was performed at 3 months after each injection. Re-treatment was offered when clinical symptoms returned. Results: A total of 20 patients (average age 13 years) received BTA injections. Of the patients 13 became continent. MBC increased from 215.6 +/- 58.8 cc to 338.3 +/- 98.4 cc (p < 0.01), MDP decreased from 43 +/- 13.7 cm H2O to 21.6 +/- 10.5 cm. H2O (p < 0.01) and compliance increased from 5.2 +/- 2.6 ml/cm H2O to 13 +/- 6.9 ml/cm. H2O (p < 0.01). At an average of 8.1 months after the first injection all 13 patients received a second injection, which led to similar improvement, ie MBC increased from 200.5 +/- 41.6 cc to 404.2 +/- 57.8 cc (p < 0.001), MDP decreased from 48.18 +/- 6.1 cm H2O to 27.8 +/- 3.7 cm H2O (p < 0.01) and compliance increased from 6.0 +/- 3.1 ml/cm. H2O to 15.1 +/- 5.2 ml/cm H2O (p < 0.01). Among the responders 3 received 3 injections and 1 received 4 injections, all of whom exhibited improvement similar to that seen initially. Among our initial cohort of 20 patients 7 failed to improve initially and 6 failed to improve after a second injection. Conclusions: BTA seems to be a simple and safe way to postpone or avoid invasive procedures in two thirds of children with myelomeningocele not responding to usual medical treatment.

Previous research showed that a functional dorsal hippocampus is not required for latent learning. The present experiments show that it is required for learning about food availability, and during retrieval of both types of information.

CNP2 differs from CNP1 by a 20 amino acid N-terminal extension and is also expressed at much lower levels in non-myelinating tissues. The functional role of CNP2, apart from CNP1, and the significance for CNP2 expression in nonmyelinating tissues are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CNP2 is translocated to mitochondria by virtue of a mitochondrial targeting signal at the N-terminus. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the targeting signal inhibits CNP2 translocation to mitochondria, thus retaining it in the cytoplasm. CNP2 is imported into mitochondria and the targeting signal cleaved, yielding a mature, truncated form similar in size to CNP1. CNP2 is entirely processed in adult liver and embryonic brain, indicating that it is localized specifically to mitochondria in non-myelinating cells. Our results point to a broader biological role for CNP2 in mitochondria that is likely to be different from its specific role in the cytoplasm, along with CNP1, during myelination.

Dialysis centre effect has been suggested to influence survival in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Few studies over the past decade have commented on the existence of the centre effect using logistic regression models. Methods. We used high quality prospectively collected data from the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) and created an artificial neural network model to predict mortality within 1 year in this cohort. We used a multitude of demographic variables including co-morbodities as well as relevant laboratory data to create a prognostic model. Results. A highly efficient model for predicting 1 year mortality was created after restricting the model to use demographic and case-enriched data [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.974]. The addition of the dialysis centre code and centre size as input variables did not add to the efficiency of the model (AUROC = 0.962). Moreover, dialysis centre code or size alone was not predictive of mortality when applied to an artificial neuronal network architecture (AUROC = 0.649 and 0.628). Conclusion. Residual effects in previous studies may have been due to the non-linear nature of the data and complex intervariable relationships. Centre size and other centre-related factors have no impact on survival on ESRD.

In order to understand the relationship between the structures of gallic acid derivatives, their antioxidant activities, and neuroprotective effects, we examined their free radical scavenging effects in liposome and anti-apoptotic activities in human SH-SY5Y cell induced by 6-hydrodopamine autooxidation. It was found that these polyphenol antioxidants exhibited different hydrophobicity and could cross through the liposome membrane to react with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical in a time and dose-dependent manner. At the same time, the structure-antioxidant activity relationship of gallic acid derivatives on scavenging DPPH free radical in the liposome was also analyzed based on theoretical investigations. Analysis of cell apoptosis, intracellular GSH levels, production of ROS and the influx of Ca2+ indicated that the protective effects of gallic acid derivatives in cell systems under oxidative stress depend on both their antioxidant capacities and hydrophobicity. However, the neuroprotective effects of gallic acid derivatives seem to depend more on their molecular polarities rather than antioxidant activities in the human SH-SY5Y cell line. In conclusion, these results reveal that compounds with high antioxidant activity and appropriate hydrophobicity are generally more effective in preventing the injury of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases.

It is known that this process is not very robust and requires frequent tuning to achieve acceptable yields. The research reported in this paper is motivated by the possibility of designing control techniques to significantly improve the performance of the RIE process. The research is broadly focused on the application of a real-time neural network based control technique. In this paper, we develop multivariable real-time intelligent control strategies to improve plasma characteristics in the RIE process. The objective is to demonstrate that by controlling appropriate key plasma parameters namely the fluorine concentration ions [F] and their energy [V-bias] through neurocontrol strategies, it is feasible to improve the etch performance of the reactive ion etchers characterized by their selectivity, uniformity, anisotropy and etch depth. We propose robust neurocontrollers for this problem and examine their effectiveness in attenuating the effects of exogenous disturbances on etch characteristics. The nonlinear nature and robustness of the proposed intelligent control algorithm enables it to provide greater accuracy and better performance when compared to standard algorithms from the RIE literature such as the conventional PI controller.

[Amblard, C., Lapalme, E., Lina, J.M. 2004. Biomagnetic source detection by maximum entropy and graphical models. IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 55 (3) 427-442], the authors introduced the maximum entropy on the mean (MEM) as a methodological framework for solving the magnetoencephalography (MEG) inverse problem. The main component of the MEM is a reference probability density that enables one to include all kind of prior information on the source intensity distribution to be estimated. This reference law also encompasses the definition of a model. We consider a distributed source model together with a clustering hypothesis that assumes functionally coherent dipoles. The reference probability distribution is defined as a prior parceling of the cortical surface. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for parceling out the cortex into regions that are functionally coherent. Based on the recently developed multivariate source prelocalization (MSP) principle [Mattout, J., Pelegrini-Issac, M., Garnero, L., Benali, H. 2005. Multivariate source prelocalization (MSP): Use of functionally informed basis functions for better conditioning the MEG inverse problem. NeuroImage 26 (2) 356373], the data-driven clustering (DDC) of the dipoles provides an efficient parceling of the sources as well as an estimate of parameters of the initial reference probability distribution. On MEG simulated data, the DDC is shown to further improve the MEM inverse approach, as evaluated considering two different iterative algorithms and using classical error metrics as well as ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis. The MEM solution is also compared to a LORETA-like inverse approach. The data-driven clustering allows to take most advantage of the MEM formalism. Its main trumps lie in the flexible probabilistic way of introducing priors and in the notion of spatial coherent regions of activation. The latter reduces the dimensionality of the problem. In so doing, it narrows down the gap between the two types of inverse methods, the popular dipolar approaches and the distributed ones. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have been limited by small samples, narrow age ranges and few behavioral measures. This multi-center project conducted epidemiologically based recruitment of a large, demographically balanced sample across a wide age range, using strict exclusion factors and comprehensive clinical/behavioral measures. A mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal design was used to create a MRI/clinical/behavioral database from approximately 500 children aged 7 days to 18 years to be shared with researchers and the clinical medicine community. Using a uniform acquisition protocol, data were collected at six Pediatric Study Centers and consolidated at a Data Coordinating Center. All data were transferred via a web-network into a MYSQL database that allowed (i) secure data transfer, (ii) automated MRI segmentation, (iii) correlation of neuroanatomical and clinical/ behavioral variables as 3D statistical maps and (iv) remote interrogation and 3D viewing of database content. A population-based epidemiologic sampling strategy minimizes bias and enhances generalizability of the results. Target accrual tables reflect the demographics of the U.S. population (2000 Census data). Enrolled subjects underwent a standardized protocol to characterize neurobehavioral and pubertal status. All subjects underwent multispectral structural MRI. In a subset, we acquired T1/T2 relaxometry, diffusion tensor imaging, single-voxel proton spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging. In the first of three cycles, successful structural MRI data were acquired in 392 subjects aged 4:6-18:3 years and in 72 subjects aged 7 days to 4:6 years. We describe the methodologies of MRI data acquisition and analysis, using illustrative results. This database will provide a basis for characterizing healthy brain maturation in relationship to behavior and serve as a source of control data for studies of childhood disorders.

J	Lee, AM; Miksys, S; Palmour, R; Tyndale, RF				Lee, AM; Miksys, S; Palmour, R; Tyndale, RF			CYP2B6 is expressed in African Green monkey brain and is induced by chronic nicotine treatment	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						CYP2B6; nicotine; brain; smoking; monkey; induction; bopropion	HUMAN CYTOCHROME P4502B6; HUMAN LIVER-MICROSOMES; RAT-BRAIN; BUPROPION HYDROXYLATION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS; CATALYTIC-ACTIVITY; METABOLISM; SMOKING; PHARMACOKINETICS	CYP2B6 is a drug-metabolizing enzyme expressed in human tissues that can activate bupropion (a smoking cessation drug) and tobacco smoke nitrosamines and can inactivate drugs such as nicotine. Smokers have higher brain CYP2B6 protein levels compared to non-smokers but the cause of this elevation is unknown. We investigated the basal expression and the effect of chronic nicotine treatment on CYP2B6 protein in African Green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) brain. Basal expression of brain CYP2B6 was strong in specific cells such as the frontal cortical pyramidal cells, the cerebellar Purkinje cells and the neurons in the substantia nigra. Basal CYP2B6 protein levels varied 2.7-fold (non-significant) among 12 brain regions. All monkeys were given a subcutaneous 0.1 mg/kg nicotine test dose prior to treatment and the maximum plasma concentration achieved was 87 +/- 69 ng/ml and the half-life was 2.6 +/- 1.5 h. Monkeys were treated subcutaneously twice daily with nicotine at 0.05 mg/kg for 2 days, 0.15 mg/kg for 2 days followed by 0.3 mg/kg for 18 days (n = 6) or saline (n = 6). Chronic nicotine treatment induced CYP2B6 expression in specific cells such as astrocytes and neurons in the frontal cortex, caudate. thalamus and hippocampus. CYP2B6 protein levels were induced 1.5-fold in the frontal cortex (p < 0.01). Hepatic CYP2B6 expression was not altered by nicotine. In conclusion, CYP2B6 protein is expressed in specific cells in monkey brain and is induced by chronic nicotine treatment which may impact central metabolism of CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion and nicotine.

The present work was designed to study the peripheral interactions between anandamide and ibuprofen (a non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor) in the rat formalin test. We first determined the ED50 for anandamide (0.018 mu g +/- 0.009), ibuprofen (0.18 mu g +/- 0.09), and their combination (0.006 mu g +/- 0.002). Drugs were given 15 min before a 2.5% formalin injection into the dorsal surface of the right hind paw. Results were analyzed using isobolographic analysis. The antinociceptive interaction between anandamide and ibuprofen was synergistic. To further investigate the mechanisms by which the combination of anandamide with ibuprofen produced their antinociceptive effects, we used specific antagonists for the cannabinoid CB1 (AM251; 80 mu g) and CB2 (AM630; 25 mu g) receptors. We demonstrated that the antinociceptive effects of ibuprofen were not antagonized by either AM251 or AM630 and that those of anandamide were antagonized by AM251 but not by AM630. The synergistic antinociceptive effects of the combination of anandamide with ibuprofen were completely antagonized by AM251 but only partially inhibited by AM630. In conclusion, locally (hind paw) injected anandamide, ibuprofen or combination thereof decreased pain behavior in the formalin test. The combination of anandamide with ibuprofen produced synergistic antinociceptive effects involving both cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. Comprehension of the mechanisms involved needs further investigation. (c) 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They respond to such noxious stimuli by a series of complex biochemical, physiologic, and behavioral alterations. Studies have concluded that controlling pain experience is beneficial with respect to short-term and perhaps long-term outcomes. Yet, pain-control measures are adopted infrequently because of unresolved scientific issues and lack of appreciation for the need for control of pain and its long-term sequelae during the critical phases of neurologic maturation in the preterm and term newborn. The neonatal pain-control group, as part of the Newborn Drug Development Initiative (NDDI) Workshop I, addressed these concerns. The specific issues addressed were (1) management of pain associated with invasive procedures, (2) provision of sedation and analgesia during mechanical ventilation, and (3) mitigation of pain and stress responses during and after surgery in the newborn infant. The cross-cutting themes addressed within each category included (1) clinical-trial designs, (2) drug prioritization, (3) ethical constraints, (4) gaps in our knowledge, and (5) future research needs. This article provides a summary of the discussions and deliberations. Full-length articles on procedural pain, sedation and analgesia for ventilated infants, perioperative pain, and study designs for neonatal pain research were published in Clinical Therapeutics (June 2005).

Similar to what occurs in numerous complex diseases, both unknown environmental factors and genetic predisposition are required to generate MS. We ascertained a set of 63 Finnish MS families, originating from a high-risk region of the country, to identify a susceptibility gene within the previously established 3.4-Mb region on 17q24. Initial single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based association implicated PRKCA (protein kinase C alpha) gene, and this association was replicated in an independent set of 148 Finnish MS families (p=0.0004; remaining significant after correction for multiple testing). Further, a dense set of 211 SNPs evenly covering the PRKCA gene and the flanking regions was selected from the dbSNP database and analyzed in two large, independent MS cohorts: in 211 Finnish and 554 Canadian MS families. A multipoint SNP analysis indicated linkage to PRKCA and its telomeric flanking region in both populations, and SNP haplotype and genotype combination analyses revealed an allelic variant of PRKCA, which covers the region between introns 3 and 8, to be over-represented in Finnish MS cases (odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.68). A second allelic variant, covering the same region of the PRKCA gene, showed somewhat stronger evidence for association in the Canadian families (odds ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.39-1.94). Initial functional relevance for disease predisposition was suggested by the expression analysis: The transcript levels of PRKCA showed correlation with the copy number of the Finnish and Canadian "risk'' haplotypes in CD4-negative mononuclear cells of five Finnish multiplex families and in lymphoblast cell lines of 11 Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) individuals of European origin.

Results of this experiment support the idea that the auditory system processes information differently within a unit, and that this processing does not occur unless the perceptual system detects unit boundaries. In this experiment, silences were inserted into a continuously changing sound to cause the formation of short units. Listeners noticed the change earlier in conditions with silences inserted than in to conditions where the transition was either unbroken or broken by loud noise bursts. Results are discussed in terms of two processes, one that accentuates stimulus properties present at moments of onset and offset, and a second that uses onsets and offsets to signal the beginnings and ends of units and reduces the change perceived within units.

J	Young, A				Young, A			Remembering the evolutionary Freud	SCIENCE IN CONTEXT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Forgetting Freud for a New Historiography of Psychoanalysis Conference	DEC, 2004	Vienna, AUSTRIA	Sigmund Freud Fdn, Univ Cambridge, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci			DEPRESSION; PSYCHIATRY	Throughout his career as a writer, Sigmund Freud maintained an interest in the evolutionary origins of the human mind and its neurotic and psychotic disorders. In common with many writers then and now, he believed that the evolutionary past is conserved in the mind and the brain. Today the "evolutionary Freud" is nearly forgotten. Even among Freudians, he is regarded to be a red herring, relevant only to the extent that lie diverts attention from the enduring achievements of the authentic Freud. There are three ways to explain these attitudes. First, the evolutionary Freud's key work is the "Overview of the Transference Neurosis" (1915). But it was published at in inopportune moment, forty years after the author's death, during the so-called "Freud wars." Second, Freud eventually lost interest in the "Overview" and the prospect of a comprehensive evolutionary theory of psychopathology. The publication of The Ego and the Id (1923), introducing Freud's structural theory of the psyche, marked the point of no return. Finally, Freud's evolutionary theory is simply not credible. It is based oil just-so stories and a thoroughly discredited evolutionary mechanism, Lamarckian use-inheritance. Explanations one and two are probably correct but also uninteresting. Explanation number three assumes that there is a fundamental difference between Freud's evolutionary narratives (not credible) and the evolutionary accounts of psychopathology that currently circulate in psychiatry and mainstream journals (credible). The assumption is mistaken but worth investigating.

With that in mind the attention of clinicians and researchers is focused ever more intently on prevention of dementia. To this end, being able to distinguish between << normal >> aging and pre-symptomatic signs of dementia is considered essential, and increasingly research is designed to detect << intermediate phenotypes >> (biomarkers) that may be evident decades before outward signs of dementia become manifest. This paper will focus on the << discovery >> of mild cognitive impairment in the early 1990s, and how it is currently undergoing revision as a result of evolving theories about epigenetics and investigation of biomarkers. Discussion will include a critical review of how this shift affects concepts of geneticization, the prudential public, and the somatized self.

J	Young, A				Young, A			Psychiatry's search for a post-genomic mind	SCIENCES SOCIALES ET SANTE			English	Article							HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; NORMAL SEX-DIFFERENCES; MIRROR NEURONS; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; PREMOTOR CORTEX; NEURAL BASIS; REPRESENTATION; EVOLUTION; DELUSIONS; LANGUAGE	The publication of DSM-III (Diagnostic Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, third edition, 1980) promoted a revolution in American psychiatry. Its most visible target was psychodynamic psychiatry and the concept of psychoneurosis. The revolution shifted the clinical gaze away from mental etiology, mechanism and process onto manifest symptoms, and redefined these symptoms as signifiers of classification rather than polymorphous adaptations. The revolution was fed by the successes of biological psychiatry, the increasing popularity of explanatory reductionism, and access to technologies that could track behavioural symptoms and self-reported mental states to their biological sources. This paper focuses on a second revolution, initiated by developments in molecular genetics and the accessibility of functional neuroimaging technology. At first glance, these developments seem to complete the earlier trend by moving explanatory reductionism to the most basic biological level, the molecular << blueprints of life >>, further undermining the usefulness of << mind >> as a construct for understanding and explaining psychiatric disorders. In reality, the second revolution is an occasion for re-inventing the mind along evolutionary lines.

Method: Using Cochrane Collaboration methods, the Ottawa Methods Group identified and synthesized evidence from comparative controlled trials. The group then formed an expert panel, which developed a set of criteria for grading the strength of the evidence and the recommendation. Patient-important outcomes were determined through consensus, provided that these outcomes were assessed with a validated and reliable scale. Results: The Ottawa Panel developed 147 positive recommendations of clinical benefit concerning the use of different types of physical rehabilitation interventions involved in post-stroke rehabilitation. Discussion and Conclusion: The Ottawa Panel recommends the use of therapeutic exercise, task-oriented training, biofeedback, gait training, balance training, constraint-induced movement therapy, treatment of shoulder subluxation, electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound, acupuncture, and intensity and organization of rehabilitation in the management of post stroke.

The combustion of MMT results in the emission of fine Mn particulates mainly in the form of manganese sulfate and manganese phosphate. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of subchronic exposure to Mn sulfate in different tissues, on locomotor activity, on neuropathology, and on blood serum biochemical parameters. A control group and three groups of 30 male SpragueDawley rats were exposed 6-h/day, 5 days/week for 13 consecutive weeks at 30, 300. or 3000 mu g/m(3) Mn Sulfate. Locomotor activity was measured during 36 h using an Auto-Track System. Blood and the following tissues were collected and analyzed for manganese content by neutron activation analysis: olfactory bulb, globus pallidus, caudate/putamen, cerebellum, frontal cortex, liver, lung, testis, and kidney. Neuronal cell counts were obtained for the caudate/putamen and the globus pallidus and clinical biochemistry was assessed. Manganese concentrations were increased in blood, kidney, lung, and testis and in all brain regions in the 3000 mu g/m(3) exposure group. Significant differences were also noted in the 300 mu g/m(3) exposure group, Neuronal cell counts for the globus pallidus were significantly different between the two highest exposed groups and the controls. Locomotor activity for all exposure concentrations and resting time for the middle and highest concentrations for the two night resting periods were significantly increased. Total ambulatory count was decreased significantly for all exposure concentrations. Biochemical profiles also presented significant differences. No body weight loss was observed between all groups. These results suggest that neurotoxicity could occur at low exposure levels of Mn sulfate, one of the main combustion products of MMT. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, it has been more difficult to address the question of how early in the processing stream this sensitivity to the information relevant to the categorization task emerges. The current study uses scalp event-related potentials recorded in humans to examine how and when information diagnostic to a particular task is processed during that task versus during a task for which it is not diagnostic. Subjects were shown diagnostic and anti-diagnostic face images for both expression and gender decisions (created using Gosselin and Schyns' Bubbles technique), and asked to perform both tasks on all stimuli. Behaviorally, there was a larger advantage of diagnostic over anti-diagnostic facial images when images designed to be diagnostic for a particular task were shown when performing that task, as compared to performing the other task. Most importantly, this interaction was seen in the amplitude of the occipito-temporal N170, a visual component reflecting a perceptual stage of processing associated with the categorization of faces. When participants performed the gender categorization task, the N170 amplitude was larger when they were presented with gender diagnostic images than with expression-diagnostic images, relative to their respective non-diagnostic stimuli. However, categorizing faces according to their facial expression was not significantly associated with a larger N170 when subjects categorized expression diagnostic cues relative to gender-diagnostic cues. These results show that the influence of higher-level task-oriented processing may take place at the level of visual categorization stages for faces, at least for processes relying on shared diagnostic features with facial identity judgments, such as gender cues.

J	Song, YN; Baker, CL				Song, YN; Baker, CL			Neural mechanisms mediating responses to abutting gratings: Luminance edges vs. illusory contours	VISUAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						illusory contours; texture segregation; figure-ground segregation; visual perception; receptive field	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; TEXTURE SEGREGATION; SUBJECTIVE CONTOURS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; 2ND-ORDER MOTION; SIMPLE CELLS; FORM VISION; ORIENTATION; PERCEPTION	The discontinuities of phase-shifted abutting line gratings give rise to perception of in '' illusory contour '' (IC) along the line terminations. Neuronal responses to such ICs have been interpreted as evidence for a specialized visual mechanism, since such responses cannot be predicted from conventional linear receptive fields. However, when the spatial scale of the component gratings (carriers) is large compared to the neuron's luminance passband, these IC responses might be evoked simply by the luminance edges at the line terminations. Thus by presenting abutting gratings at a series of carrier spatial scales to cat A18 neurons, we were able to distinguish genuine nonlinear responses from those due to luminance edges. Around half of the neurons (both simple and complex types) showed a bimodal response pattern to abutting gratings: one peak at a low carrier spatial frequency range that overlapped with the luminance passband, and a second distinct peak at much higher frequencies beyond the neuron's grating resolution. For those bimodally responding neurons. the low-frequency responses were sensitive to carrier phase, but the high-frequency responses were phase-invariant. Thus the responses at low carrier spatial frequencies could be understood via a linear model, while the higher frequency responses represented genuine nonlinear IC processing, IC responsive neurons also demonstrated somewhat lower spatial preference to the periodic contours (envelopes) compared to gratings, but the optimal orientation and motion direction for both were quite similar. The nonlinear responses to ICS could be explained by the same energy mechanism underlying responses to second-order stimuli such as contrast-modulated,ratings. Similar neuronal preferences for ICs and for gratings may contribute to the form-cue invariant perception of moving contours.

Methods: A Canadian Cohort Study of Cognitive Impairment and Related Dementias (ACCORD) is a longitudinal investigation of individuals referred to eight Canadian dementia centers for evaluation of cognitive impairment and neurobehavioral symptoms. Of the inception cohort of 804 subjects for whom the informant-based Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was completed at study entry, 35 were classified as NCI, 193 as CIND, and 576 as dementia. The three diagnostic groups were compared on each of the 12 NPI items. Within each diagnostic group, comparisons were also made between symptomatic (NPS+; total score > 1) and asymptomatic (NPS-; total score = 0) subjects on measures of general cognitive status and functional disability. A subset of the NCI and CIND individuals were also compared on a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Results: There was at least one NPI item reported in 60% of subjects with NCI, 74% with CIND, and 89% with dementia. The item scores for delusions, hallucinations, agitation, apathy, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, and problems with appetite were greater in dementia subjects than in NCI or CIND. There were no significant differences between subjects with NCI and CIND on any NPI item. For each diagnostic group, NPS+ subjects were more impaired on functional but not neuropsychological measures. Conclusions: Across all levels of cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are an important feature in individuals referred to dementia clinics. The current data suggest that NPS may precede cognitive deficits in individuals classified as not cognitively impaired and cognitively impaired - not demented.

Traditionally, consolidation has been viewed as an event that occurs once in the life of a memory. However, considerable evidence now indicates that consolidated memories, when reactivated through retrieval, become labile (susceptible to disruption) again and undergo reconsolidation. Because memories are often interrelated in complex associative networks rather than stored in isolation, a key question is whether reactivation of one memory makes associated memories labile in a way that requires reconsolidation. We tested this in rats by creating interlinked associative memories using a second-order fear-conditioning task. We found that directly reactivated memories become labile, but indirectly reactivated (i.e., associated) memories do not. This suggests that memory reactivation produces content-limited rather than wholesale changes in a memory and its associations and explains why each time a memory is retrieved and updated, the entire associative structure of the memory is not grossly altered.

We previously proposed that early-life experience results in stable epigenetic programming of glucocorticoid receptor gene expression in the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to examine the global effect of early-life experience on the hippocampal transcriptome and the development of stress-mediated behaviors in the offspring and whether such effects were reversible in adulthood. Adult offspring were centrally infused with saline vehicle, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), or the essential amino acid L-methionine. The animals were assessed in an unfamiliar open-field arena, and the hippocampal transcriptome of each animal was evaluated by microarray analysis. Here we report that TSA and methionine treatment reversed the effect of maternal care on open-field behavior. We identified > 900 genes stably regulated by maternal care. A fraction of these differences in gene expression is reversible by either the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA or the methyl donor L-methionine. These results suggest that early-life experience has a stable and broad effect on the hippocampal transcriptome and anxiety-mediated behavior, which is potentially reversible in adulthood.

Using the whole-cell clamp technique, we looked for acute effects of MANF on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta of 6 to 15-day-old rats. In slices, MANF increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs and decreased the paired pulse ratio. In mechanically dissociated cells, MANF increased the frequency of spontaneous and miniature IPSCs, without changing their mean amplitudes; and in enzymatically dissociated neurons, MANF had no effect on currents induced by exogenous GABA. The presynaptic enhancement of GABAergic inhibition may contribute to MANF's protective action on dopamine cells.

J	Delsuc, F; Brinkmann, H; Chourrout, D; Philippe, H				Delsuc, F; Brinkmann, H; Chourrout, D; Philippe, H			Tunicates and not cephalochordates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates	NATURE			English	Article							PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; OIKOPLEURA-DIOICA; NEURAL CREST; DEUTEROSTOME; TREE; AMPHIOXUS; EVOLUTION; ANIMALS	Tunicates or urochordates (appendicularians, salps and sea squirts), cephalochordates (lancelets) and vertebrates (including lamprey and hagfish) constitute the three extant groups of chordate animals. Traditionally, cephalochordates are considered as the closest living relatives of vertebrates, with tunicates representing the earliest chordate lineage(1,2). This view is mainly justified by overall morphological similarities and an apparently increased complexity in cephalochordates and vertebrates relative to tunicates(2). Despite their critical importance for understanding the origins of vertebrates(3), phylogenetic studies of chordate relationships have provided equivocal results(4-7). Taking advantage of the genome sequencing of the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica, we assembled a phylogenomic data set of 146 nuclear genes (33,800 unambiguously aligned amino acids) from 14 deuterostomes and 24 other slowly evolving species as an outgroup. Here we show that phylogenetic analyses of this data set provide compelling evidence that tunicates, and not cephalochordates, represent the closest living relatives of vertebrates. Chordate monophyly remains uncertain because cephalochordates, albeit with a non-significant statistical support, surprisingly grouped with echinoderms, a hypothesis that needs to be tested with additional data. This new phylogenetic scheme prompts a reappraisal of both morphological and palaeontological data and has important implications for the interpretation of developmental and genomic studies in which tunicates and cephalochordates are used as model animals.

J	Levesque, J; Beauregard, M; Mensour, B				Levesque, J; Beauregard, M; Mensour, B			Effect of neurofeedback training on the neural substrates of selective attention in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						attention; AD/HD children; neurofeedback; fMRI; anterior cingulate cortex	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; LEARNING-DISABILITIES; COUNTING STROOP; EEG BIOFEEDBACK; INTERFERENCE; ADHD; METHYLPHENIDATE; PERFORMANCE; MODULATION	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder mainly characterized by impairments in cognitive functions. Functional neuroimaging studies carried out in individuals with AD/HD have shown abnormal functioning of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during tasks involving selective attention. In other respects, there is mounting evidence that neurofeedback training (NFT) can significantly improve cognitive functioning in AD/HD children. In this context, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted to measure the effect of NFT on the neural substrates of selective attention in children with AD/HD. Twenty AD/HD children-not taking any psychostimulant and without co-morbidity-participated to the study. Fifteen children were randomly assigned to the Experimental (EXP) group (NFT), whereas the other five children were assigned to the Control (CON) group (no NFT). Subjects from both groups were scanned I week before the beginning of the NFT (Time 1) and I week after the end of this training (Time 2), while they performed a Counting Stroop task. At Time 1, for both groups, the Counting Stroop task was associated with significant loci of activation in the left superior parietal lobule. No activation was noted in the ACC. At Time 2, for both groups, the Counting Stroop task was still associated with significant activation of the left superior parietal lobule. This time, however, for the EXP group only there was a significant activation of the right ACC. These results suggest that in AD/HD children, NFT has the capacity to normalize the functioning of the ACC, the key neural substrate of selective attention. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

How these modifications are coordinated in vivo is an important issue that is poorly understood but is relevant to many biological processes. We recently showed that human MEF2D (myocyte enhancer factor 2D) is sumoylated on Lys-439. Adjacent to the sumoylation motif is Ser-444, which like Lys-439 is highly conserved among MEF2 proteins from diverse species. Here we presented several lines of evidence to demonstrate that Ser-444 of MEF2D is required for sumoylation of Lys-439. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) stimulated this modification by acting through Ser-444. In addition, phosphorylation of Ser-444 by Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent kinase known to inhibit MEF2 transcriptional activity, stimulated sumoylation. Opposing the actions of HDAC4 and Cdk5, calcineurin (also known as protein phosphatase 2B) dephosphorylated Ser-444 and inhibited sumoylation of Lys-439. This phosphatase, however, exerted minimal effects on the phosphorylation catalyzed by ERK5, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase known to activate MEF2D. These results identified an essential role for Ser-444 in MEF2D sumoylation and revealed a novel mechanism by which calcineurin selectively "edits" phosphorylation at different sites, thereby reiterating that interplay between different modifications represents a general mechanism for coordinated regulation of eukaryotic protein functions in vivo.

Here, we propose a method to identify these large-scale networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Regions belonging to such networks are defined as sets of strongly interacting regions, each of which showing a homogeneous temporal activity. Our method of large-scale network identification (LSNI) proceeds by first detecting functionally homogeneous regions. The networks of functional interconnections are then found by comparing the correlations among these regions against a model of the correlations in the noise. To test the LSNI method, we first evaluated its specificity and sensitivity on synthetic data sets. Then, the method was applied to four real data sets with a block-designed motor task. The LSNI method correctly recovered the regions whose temporal activity was locked to the stimulus. In addition, it detected two other main networks highly reproducible across subjects, whose activity was dominated by slow fluctuations (0-0.1 Hz). One was located in medial and dorsal regions, and mostly overlapped the "default" network of the brain at rest [Greicius, M.D., Krasnow, B., Reiss, A.L., Menon, V., 2003. Functional connectivity in the resting brain: a network analysis of the default mode hypothesis. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A. 100, 253-258]; the other was composed of lateral frontal and posterior parietal regions. The LSNI method we propose allows to detect in an exploratory and systematic way all the regions and large-scale networks activated in the working brain. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The model for such a network is a system of nonlinear delay differential equations. After some consideration of the absolute synchronization of the system and the global attractivity of the zero solution, we present a detailed discussion about the boundaries of the stability region of the trivial solution. This allows us to determine the possible codimension one bifurcations which occur in the system. In particular, we show the existence of standard Hopf bifurcations giving rise to synchronized periodic solutions and of D-3 equivariant Hopf bifurcations giving rise to three types of periodic solutions: phase-locked, mirror-reflecting, and standing waves. Hopf-Hopf and Hopf-steady state bifurcations interactions are shown to exist and give rise to coexistence of stable synchronized and desynchronized solutions. Perturbation techniques coupled with the Floquet theory are used to determine the stability of the phase-locked oscillations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(Hinek, A., Keeley, F. W., and Callahan, J. W. (1995) Exp. Cell Res. 220, 312-324). We now demonstrate that EBP also forms a cell surface-targeted molecular complex with protective protein/cathepsin A and sialidase (neuraminidase-1), and provide evidence that this sialidase activity is a prerequisite for the subsequent release of tropoelastin. We found that treatment with sialidase inhibitors repressed assembly of elastic fibers in cultures of human skin fibroblasts, aortic smooth muscle cells, and ear cartilage chondrocytes and caused impaired elastogenesis in developing chick embryos. Fibroblasts derived from patients with congenital sialidosis (primary deficiency of neuraminidase-1) and galactosialidosis (secondary deficiency of neuraminidase-1) demonstrated impaired elastogenesis, which could be reversed after their transduction with neuraminidase-1 cDNA or after treatment with bacterial sialidase, which has a similar substrate specificity to human neuraminidase-1. We postulate that neuraminidase-1 catalyzes removal of the terminal sialic acids from carbohydrate chains of microfibrillar glycoproteins and other adjacent matrix glycoconjugates, unmasking their penultimate galactosugars. In turn, the exposed galactosugars interact with the galectin domain of EBP, thereby inducing the release of transported tropoelastin molecules and facilitating their subsequent assembly into elastic fibers.

Accordingly, the NI potential indexes mechanisms connecting the separate parts of the illusory form, whereas a subsequent negative potential indexes compensatory processes triggered by perceptual difficulty. Here, perceptual difficulty was induced by bistability; that is, by equating the probability of perceiving the illusory form to that of perceiving the independent separate parts. We compared the brain potentials evoked by a strongly connected illusory square, with almost no bistability, with those evoked by a weakly connected illusory square presenting strong bistability. Consistent with our hypotheses, the latter figure evoked the smallest NI and a larger negative component peaking at 360ms (N360). These results strengthen the link between NI and connection and between negativity to perceptual difficulty and perceptual difficulty.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action by which INGAP peptide promotes neurite outgrowth in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. Treatment of dorsal root ganglia primary dispersed cultures with INGAP peptide led to the displacement of fluorescently labeled forskolin from adenylate cyclase, the cyclic AMP-generating enzyme that has been implicated in neuritogenesis. The addition of forskolin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP enhanced the effects of INGAP peptide on neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglia explant cultures. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of adenylate cyclase with SQ22,536 or of protein kinase A with H89 or KT5720 significantly reduced the neurite-promoting effects of INGAP peptide. These results suggest that INGAP peptide-induced neurite outgrowth in the dorsal root ganglia partially involves cyclic AMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A.

The combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy has been envisioned as a therapeutic approach for GBM. The goal of this study is to determine if epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg), a green tea-derived anti-cancer molecule, can modulate GBMs' response to ionizing radiation (IR) and whether this involves mediators of intracellular signaling and inhibitors of apoptosis proteins. Material and methods: U-87 human GBM cells were cultured and transfected with cDNAs encoding for Survivin, RhoA or Caveolin-1. Mock and transfected cells were irradiated at sublethal single doses. Cell proliferation was analyzed by nuclear cell counting. Apoptosis was detected using a fluorometric caspase-3 assay. Analysis of protein expression was accomplished by Western immunoblotting. Results: IR (10 Gy) reduced control U-87 cell proliferation by 40% through a caspase-independent mechanism. The overexpression of Survivin induced a cytoprotective effect against IR, while the overexpression of RhoA conferred a cytosensitizing effect upon IR. Control U-87 cells pretreated with EGCg exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in their proliferation rate. The growth inhibitory effect of EGCg was not antagonized by overexpressed Survivin. However, Survivin -transfected cells pretreated with EGCg became sensitive to IR, and their RhoA expression was downregulated. A potential therapeutic effect of EGCg targeting the prosurvival intracellular pathways of cancer cells is suggested to act synergistically with IR. Conclusion: The radioresistance of GBM is possibly mediated by a mechanism dependent on Survivin in conjunction with RhoA. The combination of natural anti-cancerous molecules such as EGCg with radiotherapy could improve the efficacy of IR treatments. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite its place as one of the most important organisms for commercial applications, the lack of available information about its genetic makeup limits research with this filamentous fungus. Results: We present here the analysis of 12,820 expressed sequence tags ( ESTs) generated from A. niger cultured under seven different growth conditions. These ESTs identify about 5,108 genes of which 44.5% code for proteins sharing similarity ( E <= 1e(-5)) with GenBank entries of known function, 38% code for proteins that only share similarity with GenBank entries of unknown function and 17.5% encode proteins that do not have a GenBank homolog. Using the Gene Ontology hierarchy, we present a first classification of the A. niger proteins encoded by these genes and compare its protein repertoire with other well-studied fungal species. We have established a searchable web-based database that includes the EST and derived contig sequences and their annotation. Details about this project and access to the annotated A. niger database are available. Conclusion: This EST collection and its annotation provide a significant resource for fundamental and applied research with A. niger. The gene set identified in this manuscript will be highly useful in the annotation of the genome sequence of A. niger, the genes described in the manuscript, especially those encoding hydrolytic enzymes will provide a valuable source for researchers interested in enzyme properties and applications.

As predicted from the known histology of the corpus callosum (massive preponderance of homotopic fibers), homotopic presentations yielded significantly faster reaction times than heterotopic stimulations. Bilateral pairs of stimuli were also advantaged in comparison with unilateral trials, replicating Sereno and Kosslyn [Sereno, A. B., & Kosslyn, S. M. (1991). Discrimination within and between hemifields: a new constraint on theories of attention. Neuropsychologia, 29, 659-675]. Moreover, certain attentional processes have never been investigated in the Dimond paradigm and this study provides evidence to the effect that discriminative reaction times to stimulus pairs are strongly influenced by their proximity to the fixation point. In similar previous experiments, the homotopy/heterotopy observation and the bilateral field advantage may have been distorted by that particular confound, as well as several others.

We show that during early postnatal life, from P0 to P10, Cux-1 and Cux-2 mRNA are coexpressed in all primary sensory cortices. Antisera to Cux-1 and Cux-2 immunoreactivities preferentially label neurons in the barrel walls of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Subsequently, Cux-1 remains enriched in sensory cortices, whereas Cux-2 expression enlarges to comprise the frontal and insular areas. The laminar distribution of Cux-1 and Cux-2 differs: Cux-1 follows a layer IV to layer II decreasing gradient of expression, whereas Cux-2 expression is homogeneous across layers IV-II. No colocalization was found with GABA and birth dating experiments showed that Cux-1-positive neurons in layer IV are born during a restricted period, E13.5-E14.5, suggesting that Cux-1 is a useful molecular marker of the glutamatergic neurons of layer IV. We examined Cux-1 and Cux-2 in barrel-defective mouse strains, the VMAT2 KO, the MAOA KO, and the Adcyl 1(brl) strain. A normal expression level of Cux-1 and Cux-2 was found in layer IV, despite the lack of segregation of the neurons as barrels. Conversely, in Reeler mice, Cux-1 and Cux-2 had a distinct laminar distribution: the Cux-1-positive neurons had an inverted deep localization, whereas the Cux-2-positive neurons were distributed throughout the cortical thickness, suggesting that Cux-2 expression is more widely expressed in the inverted cortex of reeler mutants. Our results indicate that Cux-1 is a useful marker of the layer IV neurons in S1, and that Cux-1 and Cux-2 are differently regulated in the upper layers of the cerebral cortex.

However, the specific contributions of the striatum in those processes remain unknown. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the caudate nucleus is primarily involved in the preparation of a novel action and not in set-shifting per se. Methods: In the present event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, a new task was developed that permitted, for the first time, to distinguish between shifts in classification when the rule is implicitly given by the task from shifts that require cognitive comparison and planning. Results: Significantly increased activity in the caudate nucleus and the putamen was observed only in conditions in which cognitive planning was required to perform a set-shift, whereas significant activation was seen in the subthalamic nucleus (another region of the basal ganglia) in all shifting conditions whether or not planning was required. Interpretation: We suggest that the caudate nucleus and the putamen are particularly important, respectively, in the planning and the execution of a self-generated novel action, whereas the subthalamic nucleus may be required when a new motor program is solicited independently of the choice of strategy.

Depth electrodes recordings have shown that epileptiform activity can be generated within these lesions, and also at a distance in the neocortex. Heterotopia seem to be part of a more complex circuitry involving also the surrounding and distant cerebral cortex. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) changes to interictal spikes using continuous EEG and functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) can help to understand non-invasively the mechanisms of epileptogenicity in these patients. We studied 14 patients with epilepsy and heterotopia using simultaneous recording of EEG-fMRI. EEG was continuously acquired from inside the scanner during 2 h sessions. Epileptic spikes were visually identified in the filtered EEG and each type of spike determined one EEG-fMRI study. We looked at positive (activation) and negative (deactivation) changes in the BOLD signal. Eleven patients had nodular heterotopia and three band heterotopia. Four patients had more than one type of spikes, with a total of 26 EEG-fMRI studies. We excluded three with less than three spikes, and therefore a total of 23 studies (12 with nodular and 11 with band heterotopia) were analysed. Nodular heterotopia: Activation was present in nine studies, with involvement of the heterotopia or surrounding cortex in six, three of which had concomitant distant activation. Deactivation was also observed in nine studies, with involvement of the heterotopia and surrounding cortex in four, three of which had concomitant distant deactivation. Band heterotopia: Activation was present in all 11 studies, and always involved the heterotopia and surrounding cortex, 9 of which had concomitant distant activation. Deactivation was also observed in all 11 studies, with involvement of both the heterotopia and surrounding cortex, in addition to distant deactivation in 5 studies. EEG-fMRI studies reveal, non-invasively, metabolic responses in the heterotopia despite the fact that spikes are generated in the neocortex. The responses, activation or deactivation, had different correlation with the lesion and surrounding or distant cortex, activation reflecting intense neuronal activity, or excitation, and deactivation a possible distant (extra-lesional) inhibition. EEG-fMRI may become a useful tool to understand the epileptogenicity of such malformations.

The kinematic analysis of AC's grasping movements in direct and perturbed conditions was compared to that of five control subjects. A novel effect in prehension was revealed-a hemispace effect-in healthy controls only. Movements to the left hemispace were faster, longer, and with a smaller grasp aperture; perturbation of both object position and distance resulted in the attenuation of the direction effect on movement time and the time to velocity peak, with a reverse pattern in the time to maximum grip aperture. Nevertheless, the correlation between transport velocity amplitude and grasp-aperture remained stable in both perturbed and non-perturbed movements, reflecting the coordination between reaching and grasping in control subjects. In contrast, transport and grasp, as well as their coordination in both direct and perturbed conditions, were negatively affected by the PPC and splenium lesion in AC, suggesting that transport and grasp rely on two functionally identifiable subsystems.

More generally, this putative variability has cast serious doubts on the feasibility of localizing linguistic operations in cortex. We present a new approach to the quantitative analysis of deficient linguistic performance, and apply it to a large data set, constructed from the published literature: Comprehension data of 69 carefully selected Broca's aphasic patients, tested on nearly 6000 stimulus sentences, were partitioned in different ways, and subjected to a series of analyses. While a certain amount of variability is indeed evident in the data, our quantitative analyses reveal a highly robust selective impairment pattern for the group: the patients' ability to analyze syntactic movement is severely compromised, in line with the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis. Further analyses suggest that patients' performance on no-movement sentence types exhibits less variation than on sentences that contain movement. We discuss the clinical and theoretical implications of our results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Reproducing a clinical pattern in normal subjects by using a dual-task treatment might be a way of evaluating the role of cognitive resources in the right hemisphere's contribution to verbal communication. This study suggests that the RH's presumed specific contribution to the processing of the alternative metaphorical meanings of words is, at least to some extent, the expression of the RH's complementary, and necessary, contribution to the pool of attentional resources needed for the most effortful processing.

Participants listened to semantically anomalous utterances in three conditions (discrimination, identification, and rating) which assessed their recognition of five prosodic emotions under the influence of different task- and response-selection demands. Findings revealed that right- and left-hemispheric lesions were associated with impaired comprehension of prosody, although possibly for distinct reasons: right-hemisphere compromise produced a more pervasive insensitivity to emotive features of prosodic stimuli, whereas left-hemisphere damage yielded greater difficulties interpreting prosodic representations as a code embedded with language content.

J	Williamson, IJS; Goodman, D				Williamson, IJS; Goodman, D			Converging evidence for the under-reporting of concussions in youth ice hockey	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article							MILD HEAD-INJURY; PLAYERS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; COLLEGIATE; RECOVERY; SEASON; BRAIN	Background: Concussions are potentially serious injuries. The few investigations of prevalence or incidence in youth ice hockey have typically relied on prospective reports from physicians or trainers and did not survey players, despite the knowledge that many athletes do not report probable concussions. Objective: This study sought to compare concussion rates in youth ice hockey that were estimated from a variety of reporting strategies. Methods: Rates were calculated from British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association ( BCAHA) official injury reports, from direct game observation by minor hockey volunteers ( such as coaches and managers), as well as from retrospective surveys of both elite and non-elite youth players. All research was conducted within the BCAHA. Results: Estimates from official injury reports for male players were between 0.25 and 0.61 concussions per 1000 player game hours (PGH). Concussion estimates from volunteer reports were between 4.44 and 7.94 per 1000 PGH. Player survey estimates were between 6.65 and 8.32 per 1000 PGH, and 9.72 and 24.30 per 1000 PGH for elite and non-elite male youth hockey, respectively. Conclusion: It was found that concussions are considerably under-reported to the BCAHA by youth hockey players and team personnel.

Phonomyography (PMG) and kinemyography (KMG) are new methods of neuromuscular monitoring. In this study, all three methods were compared to determine neuromuscular blockade at the adductor pollicis muscle. Methods: In 14 patients, phonomyography was recorded via a microphone taped to the thenar region. A standard mechanomyographic device was applied to the same thumb, and attached to the force transducer. On the contralateral side, a NMT-Mechanosensor(R) probe was attached to the thumb and forefinger (KMG). After induction of general anaesthesia, the ulnar nerves were stimulated supramaximally using superficial electrodes at the wrists using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation every 12 sec. Onset and recovery indices measured by the three methods after mivacurium 0.2 mg.kg(-1) iv were compared using ANOVA-multiple group comparisons. Agreement between methods was determined using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. Results: Onset time and peak effect measured via MMG and PMG were similar. Recovery times from neuromuscular blockade (NMB) as measured via the three methods were not different. Agreement between PMG and MMG was excellent for onset and offset of NMB but unsatisfactory for peak effect. Agreement between MMG and KMG was satisfactory for TOF 0.25 and 0.50, and excellent for TOF 0.75 and 0.90 (onset and peak effect not determined for KMG). Agreement between PMG and KMG was satisfactory for TOF 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75, and excellent for TOF 0.90. Conclusion: Mechanomyography, PMG and KMG show satisfactory agreement for determination of recovery of NMB for clinical purposes.

Perhaps the single most important problem is the increasing incidence of dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 50-60% of the dementias in later life within a spectrum of other contributing dementias. Regulatory approval has been given to Acetyleholinesterase inhibitors for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate AD, and conditional approval to memantine for the symptoms of moderate to severe AD. There has been no regulatory approval for the treatment of the degenerative dementias beyond AD. The very rapid progress in the past decade in biotechnology and in the molecular biology of the dementias is supporting a new generation of innovative treatment strategies that will more directly target the underlying disease pathogenic mechanisms. Such treatments will foreseeably include immunotherapies, anti-aggregants that may prevent misfolding and deposition of proteins, and neuroregenerative interventions.

The patient presented with a history of unilateral painless red eye and displayed on examination a nodule in the superior orbital rim, proptosis, and neurotrophic keratitis. Clinical and radiographic examinations were followed by biopsy of the orbital mass. Computed tomography displayed an extraconal mass adjacent to the left superior orbital rim extending to the soft tissues. Light microscopy findings suggested the diagnosis of orbital metastatic breast carcinoma that was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The histopathologic diagnosis was metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast to the left orbit. Comments: This study emphasizes that orbital metastasis must be considered in patients with ocular complaints and neoplastic disease thought to be stable.

Here, we have developed and optimized a purification strategy to isolate and identify natural inhibitors of glioma cell invasion in a three-dimensional collagen type I matrix. Inter alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 2 (ITI 112) was identified from the most inhibitory fractions and its presence was confirmed both as a single protein and in a bikunin-bound form. Stable overexpression in U251 glioma cells validated ITI H2's strong inhibition of human glioma cell invasion together with significant inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion of cell-cell adhesion. Analysis of primary human brain tumors showed significantly higher levels of ITI H2 in normal brain and low-grade tumors compared with high-grade gliomas, indicating an inverse correlation with malignancy. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade seemed to be one of the pathways involved in the effect of ITI H2 on U251 cells. These findings suggest that reduction of ITI H2 expression correlates with brain tumor progression and that targeting factors responsible for its loss or restoring the ITI supply exogenously may serve as potential therapeutic strategies for a variety of CNS tumors.

However, the mode of Csp-6 activation is not known. Here, we show that the Csp-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-fmk specifically prevents activation of Csp-6 and cell death in human neurons. A transient increase in Csp-1-like activity and an increase in the p23Csp-1 subunit occur early after serum deprivation. Recombinant active Csp-1 (R-Csp-1) cleaves recombinant and neuronal pro-Csp-6 in vitro resulting in Csp-6 activity. However, R-Csp-1 does not induce cell death when microinjected in human neurons despite the inhibition of serum-deprivation induced cell death with a Csp-1 dominant negative construct. These results show that Csp-1 is an upstream positive regulator of Csp-6-mediated cell death in primary human neurons. Furthermore, these results suggest that the activation of Csp-1 must be accompanied by an apoptotic insult to induce Csp-6-mediated cell death.

AEG3482, the parental compound, was identified in a screening effort designed to detect compounds that reduce apoptosis of neonatal sympathetic neurons after NGF withdrawal. We show that AEG3482 blocks apoptosis induced by the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) or its cytosolic interactor, NRAGE, and demonstrate that AEG3482 blocks proapoptotic JNK activity. We show that AEG3482 induces production of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), an endogenous inhibitor of JNK, and establish that HSP70 accumulation is required for the AEG3482-induced JNK blockade. We show that AEG3482 binds HSP90 and induces HSF1-dependent HSP70 mRNA expression and find that AEG3482 facilitates HSP70 production while retaining HSP90 chaperone activity. These studies establish that AEG3482 inhibits JNK activation and apoptosis by a mechanism involving induced expression of HSP proteins.

It occurs in up to 1% of the general population and is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections and renal failure. Despite treatment of affected children for the past 40 years, the incidence of end-stage renal disease secondary to VUR has not decreased. Twin and family studies reveal that VUR has a genetic basis. Some of the gene candidates that have been identified regulate the position of ureteric budding, a critical step in both kidney and urinary tract development. Analysis of data from humans and mice suggests that some of the renal damage associated with VUR is congenital and is due to a kidney malformation. Therefore, in these cases, the association of VUR and renal failure may be caused by a genetic defect affecting the formation of the kidney and the urinary tract.

Methods: Polysomnographic recordings were made of the sleep of 9 healthy human subjects, including electromyograms of the suprahyoid, temporalis and masseter cranial muscles and the anterior tibialis limb muscle. Quantitative assessments of EMG activity were carried out with root mean square (RMS) and frequency-spectral analysis (FSA) methods. Results: From wakefulness to sleep, a significant reduction (-25.2 to -71.2%; P < 0.01) was observed in EMG activity (for both RMS and FSA) of the 3 cranial muscles Using both methods of analysis. The EMG activity of suprahyoid muscle further decreased from non-REM to REM sleep (-17.8 to -43.0%; P < 0.01). In contrast, the EMG activity of the anterior tibialis muscle was only slightly reduced across sleep stages and did not further reduce during REM sleep. During REM sleep, all the 4 muscles maintained minimal activity. Conclusions: The maintenance of muscle activity during REM sleep suggests that a minimal level of activity is required to preserve physiological functions (e.g. airway patency, posture) related to homeostasis and bodily protection. Significance: This study suggests that quantitative sleep EMG analysis is important for understanding the mechanisms of sleep-related movement disorders or when objective assessment of changes in EMG activity are needed for diagnostic purposes or for the assessment of drug efficiency.

Methods: EEG was recorded during the rest and under 5, 7.5, 10 and 12.5 Hz IPS in 41 children between 3 and 16 years and 10 adults. We distinguished between the spontaneous resting EEG spectra, SSVEPs (1 st harmonic) and undriven (ongoing) EEG spectra recorded during the IPS. Results: We show that IPS influences spontaneous EEG activity by specifically suppressing or desynchronizing individual posterior dominant resting EEG frequencies (DF) in both children and adults. Further, this highly significant and consistent suppressing effect positively correlates with the SSVEPs amplitude. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the desynchronization of the spontaneous EEG activity under IPS and the SSVEPs are related to each other. Significance: These relationships could be interesting to study in pathological conditions where the neural synchronization and the responses to IPS have been shown to be affected, such as epilepsy and schizophrenia.

Physicians face a multitude of challenges related to progression of the primary condition, the presence of a diversity of other related and unrelated symptoms, the safety, efficacy and tolerability issues associated with multiple therapies being required and the changing need for collaboration with other specialities. Scope: Current guidelines produced by the urological communities, as well as the disease-focused organizations, aim to standardize care in their specific group of patients. A passive approach to implementation, however, means that guidelines produced are all too frequently not readily available to, read by or followed by the wider audience. In addition, each speciality has its own guidelines and a different view of the primary focus of care in neurological patients, which may lead to variations in recommendations and, subsequently, in clinical practice. A review of current urological and disease specific guidelines was made to evaluate differences between the published guidance between the specialities and within urology itself. Conclusions: Although availability of effective therapies remains a cornerstone of neurogenic bladder treatment, consideration must also be given to the non-pharmacological and surgical issues related to the global management of this population. Improved cross-speciality interactions and development of patient-specific treatment and follow-up plans, which are in keeping with the current guidelines of each speciality involved, may serve to enhance physicians' understanding of the importance of effective urinary incontinence treatment as well as the overall management of the patient.

Previously, we have shown that activation of T cells through the TCR leads to the upregulation of caspase-3 levels. These findings highlight the importance of regulating the expression of caspase-3 in order to prevent premature cell death. To better understand the regulation of the caspase-3 gene, a portion of the 5'-untranslated region was cloned, sequenced, and characterized. The segment of the 5'-flanking region of the caspase-3 gene was also cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene, demonstrating that this fragment contains promoter activity. Higher luciferase expression was found with several of the promoter deletion constructs in Jurkat T cells but not the mouse Neuro-2A neuroblastoma cell line, suggesting the presence of a T-cell-specific regulated region. The importance of these sequences is further supported by the genomic organization of the human and mouse caspase-3 promoter regions. These findings demonstrated that the -2245/+14 region of the caspase-3 promoter shows constitutive levels of expression, and that several regions of the promoter play a role in basal regulation.

Our objective was to investigate blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to temporal lobe (TL) spikes by using EEG-fMRI recording. Methods: We studied 35 patients who had a diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and active TL spiking on routine scalp EEG recording. Two-hour sessions of continuous EEG-fMRI were recorded, and spikes were identified after offline artifact removal and used as events in the fMRI analysis. Each type of spike was analyzed separately, as one EEG-fMRI study. We determined significant (p < 0.05) positive (activation) and negative (deactivation) BOLD responses for each study. Results: Twenty-seven patients had spikes during scanning (19 unilateral and eight bilateral). From a total of 35 fMRI studies, 29 (83%) showed BOLD responses: 14 had both activations and deactivations; 12, activations only; and three, deactivations only. Six (17%) showed no responses. Nineteen studies had mainly neocortical TL activation: Sixteen (84%) of 19 concordant with spikes, 12 of 16 with concomitant activation of the contralateral TL, and 16 of 19 with additional extratemporal activation; few showed exclusively mesial TL activation. Seventeen studies showed deactivation, either extratemporal plus temporal (n = 8) or exclusively extratemporal (n = 9). Conclusions: BOLD responses to TL spikes occurred in 83% of studies, predominated in the spiking temporal lobe, and manifested as activation or deactivation. Responses often involved the contralateral homologous cortex at the time of unilateral spikes and were frequently observed in extratemporal regions, suggesting that TL epileptic spikes can affect neuronal activity at a distance through synaptic connections.

Although the drug is generally well tolerated, behavioral side effects have been reported in variable frequency. Most behavioral problems are mild in nature (agitation, hostility, anxiety, emotional lability, apathy, depression) and quickly resolve with discontinuation of medication. However, serious psychiatric adverse events may also occur with rare cases of psychosis and suicidal behavior. We report here the case of a 43-year-old woman who developed symptoms compatible with catatonia after being exposed to levetiracetam for the treatment of epilepsy. To our knowledge, it is the first reported case of catatonia induced by levetiracetam. We review the difficulties that may be encountered in the differential diagnosis of medical catatonia.

In vivo studies suggest that AMPH sensitization requires enhanced expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the nucleus of midbrain astrocytes. One idea is that the AMPH-induced increase in bFGF expression in astrocytes leads to enhanced secretion of this peptide and to long-term plasticity in DA neurons. To study directly the effects of astrocytic expression of bFGF on DA neurons, we established a cell-culture model of mesencephalic astrocytes and DA neurons. Immunolabelling showed that even in the absence of a pharmacological stimulus, the majority of mesencephalic astrocytes in culture express bFGF at a nuclear level. Arguing against the idea that bFGF was secreted, bFGF was undetectable in the extracellular medium (below 10 pg/mL). However, supplementing culture medium with exogenous bFGF at standard concentrations (20 ng/mL) led to a dramatic change in the morphology of astrocytes, increased spontaneous DA release, and inhibited synapse formation by individual DA neurons. RNA interference (siRNA) against bFGF mRNA, caused a reduction in DA release but produced no change in synaptic development. Together these data demonstrate that under basal conditions (in the absence of a pharmacological stimulus such as amphetamine) bFGF is not secreted even though there is abundant nuclear expression in astrocytes. The effects of bFGF seen here on DA neurons are thus likely to be mediated through more indirect glial-neuronal interactions, leading to enhanced DA release without a necessary change in synapse number.

However, the mechanisms regulating excitability in this area remain unknown. By employing field potential and sharp-electrode intracellular recordings in horizontal rat brain slices comprising the IC and the perirhinal cortex, we studied here the intrinsic and network characteristics of neurons in the agranular IC. These cells generated regular action potential firing with weak adaptation during intracellular injection of depolarizing current pulses, and were pyramidal in shape when neurobiotin filled. Spontaneous, field events (duration = 2.3 +/- 0.25 s; intervals of occurrence = 44.9 +/- 6.3 s) were identified in 22/52 slices and corresponded in IC neurons to intracellular depolarizations with action potential firing. Similar field and intracellular discharges were elicited in all slices by electrical stimuli. Antagonizing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors blocked the spontaneous activity and reduced or abolished the stimulus-induced discharges. In the latter cases, stimuli elicited depolarizing events that became hyperpolarizing at about -64 mV, suggesting the contribution of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor-mediated conductances. Our findings identify for the first time some functional properties of agranular IC neurons and point at a powerful NMDA receptor-mediated mechanism implementing network hyperexcitability. This feature may contribute to the role of IC in neurological disorders.

Impaired performance may be related to deficits in bimanual temporal coordination due to stroke-related damage of specific brain motor structures as well as changed biomechanics of the paretic arm. To determine the extent of the deficit in bilateral temporal coordination after the stroke, we investigated how bilateral reciprocal coordination was regained after external perturbations of the arm in individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke. We used a bilateral task that would be minimally affected by the unilateral arm motor deficit. Nine non-disabled control subjects and 12 individuals with chronic hemiparesis performed reciprocal (anti-phase) arm swinging in the standing position for 15 s per trial. In each trial, movement of one arm was unexpectedly and transiently (similar to 150-350 ms) arrested at the level of the wrist once in the forward and once in the backward phase of swinging. Perturbation was applied to the left and right arms in control subjects and to the paretic and non-paretic arms of individuals with hemiparesis. Kinematic data from endpoint markers on both hands and electromyographic activity of anterior and posterior deltoid muscles from both arms were recorded. The oscillatory period, the phase differences between arms and the mean EMG activity before, during and after perturbation were analyzed. In both groups the perturbation altered the period of the perturbed cycle in both the arrested and non-arrested arms and resulted in a change from anti-phase to in-phase coordination, following which anti-phase coordination was regained. Recovery of anti-phase swinging took significantly longer in patients with hemiparesis compared to control subjects. Stable pre-perturbed (anti-phase) reciprocal coordination was regained within one cycle following perturbation for the control subjects and within two cycles following perturbation for the patients with hemiparesis. Analysis of EMG activation levels showed that, compared to control subjects, there was significantly less activation of the shoulder muscles in response to perturbation in the patient group and the pattern of muscle activation in the paretic arm was opposite to that in the non-paretic and control arms. The finding that patients had a reduced capacity for maintaining and restoring the required reciprocal coordination when perturbation occurred suggests that stroke-related brain damage in our patients led to instability of bilateral temporal coordination for this rhythmical task.

J	Danilovich, N; Sairam, MR				Danilovich, N; Sairam, MR			Recent female mouse models displaying advanced reproductive aging	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY			English	Review							ARYL-HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR; HAPLOINSUFFICIENT MICE; OVARIAN RESERVE; MENOPAUSE; WOMEN; 4-VINYLCYCLOHEXENE; REPERCUSSIONS; FOLLICLES; PATHOLOGY; DYNAMICS	Reproductive senescence occurs in all female mammals with resultant changes in numerous body functional systems and several important features may be species-specific. Those features that appear to parallel human menopause and aging include general similarity of hormone profiles across the menopausal transition, progression to cycle termination through irregular cycles, declining fertility with age, disturbances in thermogenesis, age-related gains in body weight, fat distribution and disposition towards metabolic syndrome. Structural and hormonal changes in the brain and ovary play a critical role in determining the onset of reproductive senescence. The short life span of rodents such as mice (compared to humans) and the ability to generate specific and timed gene deletions, provide powerful experimental paradigms to understand the molecular and functional changes that precede and follow the loss of reproductive capacity. In theory, any manipulation that compromises ovarian function either partly or totally would impact reproductive events at various levels followed by other dysfunctions. In this article, we provide an overview of three mouse models for the study of female reproductive aging. They are derived from different strategies and their age related phenotypes have been characterized to varying degrees. The follitropin receptor knockout (FORKO) Mouse, in its null and haploinsufficient state as well as the dioxin/aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) knockout mouse, serve as two examples of single gene deletions. A third model, using administration of a chemical toxicant such as 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) in the adult state, produces ovarian deficiencies accompanied by aging changes. These will serve as useful alternatives to previously used radical ovariectomy in young adults. It is anticipated that these new models and more that will be forthcoming will extend opportunities to understand reproductive aging and resolve controversies that abound on issues related to benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy or other modalities for improving quality of life.

Yet, despite the production of angiogenic factors within ischemic tissues, compensatory growth of new vessels fails to provide adequate vascularization. Thus, we hypothesized that local factors counter efficient revascularization. Whereas ischemia is often considered to be synonymous with an oxygen deficit, it is also associated with a concomitant local elevation of carbon dioxide (CO2). Although studies suggest that hypercapnia impacts tissue neovascularization, its significance relative to the abundantly described effects of hypoxia and its underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of hypercapnia on blood vessel growth in models of developmental and ischemic neovascularization. Acute and prolonged CO2 exposure inhibited developmental neovascularization of the rodent retina, as well as revascularization of the ischemic retina. Hypercapnia induced early increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase and nitrative stress, associated with astrocyte impairment and endothelial cell death, as well as downregulation of the proangiogenic prostaglandin E-2 receptor EP3. These results establish a previously unexplored means by which hypercapnia hinders efficient neovascularization, a mechanism that may contribute to ischemic tissue injury. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk rats represent a genetic model of absence seizures associated with generalized spike and wave (SW) discharges in vivo. When filled with neurobiotin, these neurons had a typical pyramidal shape with extensive apical and basal dendritic trees; moreover, WAG/Rij and NEC cells had similar fundamental electrophysiological and repetitive firing properties. Sequences of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) were induced in both the strains by electrical stimuli delivered to the underlying white matter or within the neocortex; however, in 24 of 55 regularly firing WAG/Rij cells but only in 2 of 25 NEC neurons, we identified a late EPSP that (1) led to action potential discharge and (2) was abolished by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 3,3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonate (20 mu M; n = 8/8 WAG/Rij cells). Finally, we found that the fast and slow components of the stimulus-induced IPSPs recorded during the application of glutamatergic receptor antagonists had similar reversal potentials in the two strains, while the peak conductance of the fast IPSP was significantly reduced in WAG/Rij cells. These findings document an increase in synaptic excitability that is mediated by NMDA receptors, in epileptic WAG/Rij rat neurons located in neocortical deep layers. We propose that this mechanism may be instrumental for initiating and maintaining generalized SW discharges in vivo.

This hypothesis led us to study brain activation patterns using positron emission tomography (PET), in which we compared word and nonword repetition in 10 right-handed native English-speakers (L1) who were proficient in their second language, French (L2), which was learned after the age of 5 years. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by the H(2)(15)O intravenous bolus method with intersubject averaging and coregistration of magnetic resonance and PET images. A comparison of CBF changes when repeating words in L2 with those seen when repeating words in (L1) demonstrated that the pattern of CBF was similar across the two conditions, with several significant CBF differences in the vicinity of the left insular cortex, ventral premotor region, and in the striatum. We hypothesize that these regions are activated when subjects are required to repeat known words, showing increased activity when there are increased articulatory demands imposed by speaking L2. Comparisons of nonword repetition in L1 and L2 revealed increased activity for L2 in the left ventral premotor region and in the cerebellum; rCBF increases were also observed in these regions in both L1 and L2 with increased number of syllables and increased articulatory complexity, suggesting a role for these regions in the complex motor control needed for the production of novel sequences.

J	Mathieu, JB; Beaudoin, G; Martel, S				Mathieu, JB; Beaudoin, G; Martel, S			Method of propulsion of a ferromagnetic core in the cardiovascular system through magnetic gradients generated by an MRI system	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						blood vessels; ferromagnetic; magnetic gradients; magnetic resonance imaging system; microdevice; propulsion	REYNOLDS-NUMBER; STEREOTAXIS; BRAIN; HYPERTHERMIA; MANIPULATION; SPHERES	This paper reports the use of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system to propel a ferromagnetic core. The concept was studied for future development of microdevices designed to perform minimally invasive interventions in remote sites accessible through the human cardiovascular system. A mathematical model is described taking into account various parameters such as the size of blood vessels, the velocities and viscous properties of blood, the magnetic properties of the materials, the characteristics of MRI gradient coils, as well as the ratio between the diameter of a spherical core and the diameter of the blood vessels. The concept of magnetic propulsion by MRI is validated experimentally by measuring the flow velocities that magnetized spheres (carbon steel 1010/1020) can withstand inside cylindrical tubes under the different magnetic forces created with a Siemens Magnetom Vision 1.5 T MRI system. The differences between the velocities predicted by the theoretical model and the experiments are approximately 10%. The results indicate that with the technology available today for gradient coils used in clinical MRI systems, it is possible to generate sufficient gradients to propel a ferromagnetic sphere in the larger sections of the arterial system. In other words, the results show that in the larger blood vessels where the diameter of the microdevices could be as large as a couple a millimeters, the few tens of mT/m of gradients required for displacement against the relatively high blood flow rate is well within the limits of clinical RI systems. On the other hand, although propulsion of a ferromagnetic core with diameter of similar to 600 mu m may be possible with existing clinical MRI systems, gradient amplitudes of several T/m would be required to propel a much smaller ferromagnetic core in small vessels such as capillaries and additional gradient coils would be required to upgrade existing MRI systems for operations at such a scale.

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively studied the clinical course and outcomes of children aged 10-20 years with medulloblastoma, treated at centers throughout Canada between 1986 and 2003. To better assess time to relapse, a cohort of patients aged 3-20 years at diagnosis was generated. Results: A total of 72 adolescents were analyzed. Five-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 78.3% +/- 5.4% and 68.0% +/- 6.2%, respectively. Late relapses occurred at a median of 3.0 years (range, 0.3-6.8 years). In univariate analysis, conventional risk stratification and the addition of chemotherapy to craniospinal radiation did not have prognostic significance. Female patients had improved overall survival (p = 0.007). Time to relapse increased with age in a linear fashion. After relapse, patients faired poorly regardless of treatment modality. Patients who did not receive chemotherapy initially had improved progression-free survival at relapse (p = 0.05). Conclusions: Our study suggests that adolescents with medulloblastoma might have a unique prognosis and pattern of relapse, dissimilar to those in younger children. They might benefit from different risk stratifications and prolonged follow-up. These issues should be addressed in future prospective trials. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY			English	Article						shoulder dystocia; neonatal injury; brachial plexus injury; macrosomia	BRACHIAL-PLEXUS INJURY; RISK-FACTORS; PREDICTOR; OBESITY; PALSY; WOMEN	Objective: To identify factors associated with the development of neonatal injury in the setting of shoulder dystocia. Study design: Medical record ICD-9 codes and a computerized perinatal database were reviewed to identify cases of shoulder dystocia from January 1996 to January 2001 in a tertiary care center. For confirmation of the diagnosis and collection of data, both maternal and neonatal charts were then reviewed and neonatal injuries categorized as either neurological ( brachial plexus injury) or skeletal ( clavicular fracture, humeral fracture). Shoulder dystocia cases were divided into groups based on the presence of neonatal injury at delivery or at discharge ( with or without Erb's palsy). The group with neonatal injury was compared for demographic and obstetrical factors to the group without injury ( control). chi(2) test, Mann Whitney test and logistic regression were used as appropriate. Results: During this 5-year period, there were 25 995 deliveries and 206 (0.8%) confirmed cases of shoulder dystocia. Of these cases, 36 (17.5%) had neonatal injury diagnosed at delivery and 25 (12%) remained with significant residual injury at discharge. Of these there were 19 cases of Erb's palsy and six cases of clavicular fracture. No association was found between neonatal injury and maternal age, ethnicity, diabetes, operative vaginal delivery or number of obstetrical maneuvers. However, maternal body mass index > 30 kg/m(2), a second stage of labor > 20 min and a birth weight > 4500 g were all associated with an increased risk of neonatal injury at delivery and at discharge, including Erb's palsy. After logistic regression analysis, only a second stage of delivery > 20 min remained significantly associated with neonatal injury at discharge. Conclusion: In our population, maternal obesity was associated with an increased risk of neonatal injury after shoulder dystocia. In addition, a short second stage of labor (< 20 min) was associated with a lower rate of neonatal injury.

This autacoid was recently shown to partake in this injury process by directly inducing endothelial cytotoxicity. We explored the mechanisms for this TXA(2)-evoked neural microvascular endothelial cell death. Stable TXA(2) mimetics 5-heptenoic acid, 7[6-(3-hydroxy-1-octenyl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-yl]-[1R-[1 alpha,4 alpha,5 beta(Z),6 alpha,(1E,3S)]]-9,11-dedioxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-methanolpoxy (U-46619) [ as well as [1S-[1 alpha,2 alpha(Z),3 beta(1E,3S*),4 alpha]]-7-[3-[3-hydroxy-4-(4-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]-hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid; I-BOP] induced a retinal microvascular degeneration in rat pups in vivo and in porcine retinal explants ex vivo and death of porcine brain endothelial cells (in culture). TXA(2) dependence of these effects was corroborated by antagonism using the selective TXA(2) receptor blocker (-)-6,8-difluoro-9-p-methyl-sulfonylbenzyl-1,2,3,4- tetrahydrocarbazol-1-yl-acetic acid (L670596). In all cases, neurovascular endothelial cell death was prevented by pan-calpain and specific m-calpain inhibitors but not by caspase-3 or pan-caspase inhibitors. Correspondingly, TXA(2) ( mimetics) augmented generation of known active m-calpain (but not mu-calpain) form and increased the activity of m-calpain (cleavage of fluorogenic substrate N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; and of alpha-spectrin into specific fragments) but not of pan-caspase or specific caspase-3 (respectively, using sulforhodamine-Val-Arg-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone and detecting its active 17- and 12-kDa fragments). Interestingly, these effects were phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent [associated with increase in inositol triphosphate and inhibited by PLC blocker 1-[6-[[17 beta-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122)] and required calcium but were not associated with increased intracellular calcium. U-46619-induced calpain activation resulted in translocation of Bax to the mitochondria, loss of polarization of the latter (using potentiometric probe 5,5', 6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1', 3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide; JC-1) and in turn release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and depletion of cellular ATP; these effects were all blocked by calpain inhibitors. Overall, this work identifies (specifically) m-calpain as a dominant protease in TXA(2)-induced neurovascular endothelial cell death.

Besides participating ill the process of endocytosis this receptor functions in the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Glogi network (TGN) or the cell surface to lysosomes. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, marked overexpression of certain lysosomal enzymes in vulnerable neuronal populations and their association to beta-amyloid (A beta) containing neuritic plaques has been correlated to altered metabolic functions. Ill the present Study, we measured the levels of IGF-II/M6P receptor and characterized its distribution profile in selected regions of AD and age-matched normal postmortem brains. Western blot analysis revealed no significant alteration in the levels of IGF-II/M6P receptor either in the hippocampus, frontal cortex or cerebellum between AD and age-matched control brains. However, a significant gene close effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele on TGF-II/M6P receptor levels was evident in the hippocampus of the AD brain. At the cellular level, immunoreactive IGF-II/M6P receptors were localized in the neurons of the frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of control brains. In AD brains, the labeling of the neurons was less intense in the frontal cortex and hippocampus than in the age-matched control brains. Additionally, IGF-II/M6P receptor immunoreactivity was observed in association with a subpopulation of A beta-containing neuritic plaques as well as tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles both in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. Reactive glial cells localized adjacent to the plaques also occasionally exhibited IGF-II/M6P receptor immunoreactivity. These results, when analyzed in context of the established role of the IGF-II/M6P receptor in the regulation of the intracellular trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, Suggest that alterations in IGF-II/M6P receptor levels/distribution are possibly associated with altered functioning of the lysosomal enzymes and/or loss of neurons observed in AD brains, especially in patients carrying APOE epsilon 4 alleles.

Oxidative stress was Measured as the percentage of: astrocytes expressing heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in post mortem temporal cortex and hippocampus after dual HO-1/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry. Glial HO-1 expression in the MCI temporal cortex and hippocampus was significantly greater than in the non-demented group and did not differ from AD values. Astroglial HO-I expression in the temporal cortex was associated with decreased scores for global cognition, episodic memory, semantic memory and working memory. Hippocampal astroglial HO-1 expression was associated with lower scores for global cognition, semantic memory and perceptual speed. Glial HO-1 immunoreactivity in the temporal cortex, but not hippocampus, correlated with the burden of neurofibrillary pathology. Cortical and hippocampal oxidative stress is a very early event in the pathogenesis of sporadic AD and correlates with the development of specific cognitive deficits in this condition.

Receptors were immunolabeled using an antibody directed against an antigenic sequence in the N-terminus of the receptor. Immunopositive neuronal cell bodies and dendrites were observed throughout the mediobasal hypothalamus, including the medial preoptic area, paraventricular, periventricular, and arcuate nuclei. Immunoreactive axons and axon terminals were also observed in the median eminence, suggesting that sst1 is also located pre-synaptically. Electron microscopic examination of the arcuate nucleus revealed a predominant association of immunoreactive sst1 with perikarya and dendrites. Most immunoreactive receptors were intracellular and localized to tubulovesicular compartments and organelles such as the Golgi apparatus, but 14% were associated with the plasma membrane. Of the latter, 47% were apposed to abbuting afferent axon terminals and 20% localized immediately adjacent to an active synaptic zone. These results demonstrate a widespread distribution of sst1 receptors in rat hypothalamus. They also show that somatodendritic sst1 receptors in the arcuate nucleus are ideally poised to mediate SRIF's modulation of afferent synaptic inputs, including central SRIF effects on growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons documented in this area.

The purpose of this paper is to study the ability of six distributed source localization methods to recover extended sources of activated cortex. Due to the frequent lack of a gold standard to evaluate source localization methods, our evaluation was performed in a controlled environment using realistic simulations of EEG interictal spikes, involving several anatomical locations with several spatial extents. Simulated data were corrupted by physiological EEG noise. Simulations involving pairs of sources with the same amplitude were also studied. In addition to standard validation criteria (e.g., geodesic distance or mean square error), we proposed an original criterion dedicated to assess detection accuracy, based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Six source localization methods were evaluated: the minimum norm, the minimum norm weighted by multivariate source prelocalization (MSP), cortical LORETA with or without additional minimum norm regularization, and two derivations of the maximum entropy on the mean (MEM) approach. Results showed that LORETA-based and MEM-based methods were able to accurately recover sources of different spatial extents, with the exception of sources in temporomesial and fronto-mesial regions. Several spurious sources were generated by those methods, however, whereas methods using the MSP always located very accurately the maximum of activity but not its spatial extent. These findings suggest that one should always take into account the results from different localization methods when analyzing real interictal spikes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Early postnatal diagnosis may prevent hypoglycemic seizures, Addisonian crises, and death. There are also occasional reports of prenatal diagnosis of IAD by findings on the maternal triple-marker screen (TMST), a combined serum analyte test that measures levels of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol for the detection of Down syndrome and open neural-tube defects. An isolated low estriol level is usually correlated with compromised uteroplacental perfusion and frequently associated with fetal death. A low estriol level in the context of normal fetal sonography and growth, after exclusion of placental sulfatase deficiency and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, should raise the suspicion of deficient fetal steroidogenesis, which leads to decreased production of adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. We describe 2 brothers with adrenal insufficiency resulting from IAD. The parents are first cousins whose first son is healthy. During the pregnancy of the second son, who died at the age of 7 weeks as a result of presumed cardiomyopathy, a low estriol level on the TMST was ignored because of a normal fetal ultrasound. In the third pregnancy, a low level was found again, and the mother was referred to our tertiary center. Ultrasonography revealed no abnormalities, and karyotype was normal. Normal levels of steroid sulfatase activity and 7-dehydrocholesterol ruled out X-linked ichthyosis and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, respectively. Postnatally, basal and stimulated cortisol and ACTH levels were low. Other pituitary functions were normal, suggesting the diagnosis of IAD. The patient was treated with a stress dose of hydrocortisone on day 2 of life, which was tapered to a maintenance dose. At the time of this writing, he was 7 months old, with normal growth and development. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in the human TPIT gene were detected in autosomal recessive IAD. TPIT is a cell-restricted T-box transcription factor that is important for the terminal differentiation of pituitary corticotrophs.

Factor analysis of subscales from the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire, Revised Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale, and Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale revealed maladaptive (Self-Critical) and relatively more adaptive (Personal Standards) perfectionism factors. In relation to the revised NEO Personality Inventory, Self-Critical Perfectionism reflected negative perceptions of the self and a defensive interpersonal orientation, whereas Personal Standards Perfectionism reflected active striving for high standards and achievement. Self-Critical Perfectionism was distinguished from neuroticism, in terms of its relations with negative interpersonal traits and current depressive symptoms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study examined whether glutamate or selective ionotrophic glutamate receptor agonists can disrupt appetitive and consummatory sexual behaviors following bilateral infusions to the VMH of females during copulation with male rats. Ovariectomized, sexually experienced female rats were implanted bilaterally with guide cannulae aimed at the ventrolateral VMH. After recovery from surgery, females were primed with estradiol benzoate and progesterone and infused with different doses of glutamate, AMPA, NMDA or kainate (n=9-10 in each dose group) 3 min prior to a test with sexually vigorous males in bilevel chambers. Glutamate infusions decreased the display of hops and darts and produced a trend toward decreased lordosis. AMPA infusions decreased the display of solicitations, hops and darts, and lordosis. NMDA infusions decreased lordosis and increased defensive behaviors and pacing. Kainate infusions decreased solicitations, hops and darts, and lordosis, and increased defensive behaviors and pacing. These data indicate that the activation of glutamate receptors in the VMH is inhibitory for both appetitive and consummatory aspects of sexual behavior in the female rat. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

J	Benton, R; Sachse, S; Michnick, SW; Vosshall, LB				Benton, R; Sachse, S; Michnick, SW; Vosshall, LB			Atypical membrane topology and heteromeric function of Drosophila odorant receptors in vivo	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							OLFACTORY SENSORY NEURONS; SILKMOTH BOMBYX-MORI; TREHALOSE SENSITIVITY; ANTENNAL LOBE; 7-TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEINS; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; MAMMALIAN SWEET; GENE-EXPRESSION; MOLECULAR-BASIS; FLY BRAIN	Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) each express two odorant receptors (ORs): a divergent member of the OR family and the highly conserved, broadly expressed receptor OR83b. OR83b is essential for olfaction in vivo and enhances OR function in vitro, but the molecular mechanism by which it acts is unknown. Here we demonstrate that OR83b heterodimerizes with conventional ORs early in the endomembrane system in OSNs, couples these complexes to the conserved ciliary trafficking pathway, and is essential to maintain the OR/OR83b complex within the sensory cilia, where odor signal transduction occurs. The OR/OR83b complex is necessary and sufficient to promote functional reconstitution of odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons that normally respond only to carbon dioxide. Unexpectedly, unlike all known vertebrate and nematode chemosensory receptors, we find that Drosophila ORs and OR83b adopt a novel membrane topology with their N- termini and the most conserved loops in the cytoplasm. These loops mediate direct association of ORs with OR83b. Our results reveal that OR83b is a universal and integral part of the functional OR in Drosophila. This atypical heteromeric and topological design appears to be an insect-specific solution for odor recognition, making the OR/OR83b complex an attractive target for the development of highly selective insect repellents to disrupt olfactory-mediated host-seeking behaviors of insect disease vectors.

J	Parker, WA; Freeman, CR				Parker, WA; Freeman, CR			A simple technique for craniospinal radiotherapy in the supine position	RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY			English	Article						craniospinal irradiation; supine position; medulloblastoma; radiotherapy	MEDULLOBLASTOMA; IRRADIATION; FIELDS; AXIS	Purpose: Craniospinal irradiation poses technical difficulties that may be addressed with the use of the newer technologies that have become available over the past decade. The use of CT simulation allows improved target localisation and beam geometry definition while significantly reducing the treatment simulation time. We have developed a CT-based technique for whole CNS irradiation in the supine position that uses fixed field parameters, asymmetric jaws for field matching and drastically reduces simulation and treatment times. Methods: The patient is CT scanned and treated in the supine position. The clinical target volume and relevant critical structures are outlined on a planning CT scan. Half beam blocked lateral fields with a collimator rotation are used to match the beam divergence from the superior border of the spinal field at the C2 vertebral body. The shielding for the cranial fields is generated automatically, and the dose distribution is calculated using a 3D treatment planning system. Fixed field parameters are used for the planning and treatment. The position of the isocenter of the spine field is always a fixed longitudinal distance from the isocenter of the brain fields. If multiple posterior fields are required, the isocenter of the second spine field is always a fixed longitudinal distance from that of the first and the gap between the fields is determined using virtual simulation and feathered during treatment using the asymmetric jaws of the linear accelerator. All treatment portals are filmed daily during the first week of treatment, and after each junction change thereafter. Results and conclusion: The supine position provides numerous advantages. Patients are more comfortable, the treatment position is more reproducible, and access to the airway is possible, if necessary, for patient sedation. The use of CT simulation decreases the simulation time, allows for increased planning accuracy, and enables the use of multimodality image registration, and 3D treatment planning. The use of asymmetric jaws allows for junction feathering without changing the patient setup or using a couch angle. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since the late 1800s, amphibians have been employed to understand vertebrate development and since [lie 1950s. the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis has been the amphibian of choice. In the past two decades, Xenopus has led the way forward in, among other things, identifying transcription factors, gene regulatory networks and inter- and intracellular signaling pathways that control early development (from fertilization through gastrulation and neurulation). Perhaps the best measure of how successful Xenopus has been as a model for early mammalian development is the observation that Much of the knowledge gleaned from Xenopus studies has subsequently directly translated to discoveries of similar mechanisms operating in mouse development. Despite this great success in early development, research on organogenesis in Xenopus has lagged behind the mouse. However, recent technical advances now make Xenopus amenable for studies oil later development, including organogenesis. Here, we discuss why Xenopus is well Suited for Such research and, we believe, permits addressing questions that have been difficult to approach using other model systems. We also highlight how Xenopus researchers have already begun studying a number of major organs, pancreas, liver, kidney and heart, and suggest how Xenopus might contribute more to these areas in the near future.

Fractionated stereotactic irradiation of these targets has the theoretical benefit of increased normal tissue sparing beyond that provided by the physical characteristics of stereotactic radiosurgery. From July 1987 to November 1992, 21 patients were treated for low-grade glioma at our institution using a hypofractionated regimen of stereotactic radiotherapy. All patients had well-circumscribed, < 40 mm tumors. No patient had had prior radiotherapy. All lesions were histologically proven WHO grade I or II glial tumors. Lesions involved sensitive brain structures and were deemed unresectable. A typical dose of 42 Gy was delivered in 6 fractions over a two-week period using rigid immobilization and a linac-based dynamic stereotactic radiosurgical technique. Patients had a median age of 23 years (9-74) and were predominantly female (60%). Median tumor diameter was 20 mm. With a median follow-up for living patients of 13.3 years, the actuarial 5, 10, and 15-year overall survival rates are 76%, 71%, and 63%, respectively. Treatment was acutely well tolerated although three patients experienced late post-therapy complications. Our results and those of 241 patients treated in nine other institutional series are reviewed. Despite some examples of favorable short-term outcomes, all reported series are highly selected and thus likely biased. The data regarding the use of SRS is limited and, in our opinion, insufficient to claim a clear therapeutic advantage to SRS in the initial management of low-grade glioma. Our own results with hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy are similar to those expected with standard therapy.

These vasopressin neurons receive random synaptic input but fire action potentials in alternating periods of activity and silence that each lasts tens of seconds. Recent work demonstrates that vasopressin cell rhythmicity depends on feedback modulation of intrinsic membrane properties and synaptic inputs by peptides released from the dendrites of these neurons. Many other neurons across the CNS release neurotransmitters from their dendrites; therefore, vasopressin cells provide an insight into the potential mechanisms that support neuronal activity patterning across the CNS.

To investigate possible reasons for this molecular switch, we genetically engineered mice to express P-0 instead of PLP in CNS myelin. In the absence of PLP, the ancestral P-0 provided a periodicity to mouse compact CNS myelin that was identical to mouse PNS myelin, where P-0 is the major structural protein today. The PLP-P-0 shift resulted in reduced myelin internode length, degeneration of myelinated axons, severe neurological disability, and a 50% reduction in lifespan. Mice with equal amounts of P-0 and PLP in CNS myelin had a normal lifespan and no axonal degeneration. These data support the hypothesis that the P-0-PLP shift during vertebrate evolution provided a vital neuroprotective function to myelin-forming CNS glia.

This study tested whether differential maternal care mediates central nervous system alterations in this model. Maternal care of mixed litters of pups born vaginally, by cesarean section or by cesarean section with anoxia, was assessed. Frequency and duration of licking and grooming by dams were similar for all birth groups. No group differences were observed in order of retrieval, when pups were displaced from the nest.

We used Cre recombinase (Cre)-loxP technology to study CNS restricted knock-out of the ilk gene by either Nestin-driven or gfap-driven Cre-mediated recombination. Developmental changes in ilk-excised brain regions are similar to those observed in mice lacking the integrin beta 1 subunit in the CNS, including defective laminin deposition, abnormal glial morphology, and alterations in granule cell migration. Decreases in 6-bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU) pulse labeling and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression in the external granule cell layer of the cerebellum demonstrated that proliferation is disrupted in granule cells lacking ILK. Previous studies have shown that laminin-sonic hedgehog (Shh)-induced granule cell precursor (GCP) proliferation is dependent on beta 1 integrins, several of which bind laminin and interact with ILK through the beta 1 cytoplasmic domain. Both ex vivo deletion of ilk and a small molecule inhibitor of ILK kinase activity decreased laminin-Shh-induced BrdU labeling in cultured GCPs. Together, these results implicate ILK as a critical effector in a signaling pathway necessary for granule cell proliferation and cerebellar development.

Selectivity for motion is first found in individual neurons in the primate visual cortex (V1), in which many simple cells respond selectively to the direction and speed of moving stimuli. Beyond simple cells, most studies of direction selectivity have focused on either V1 complex cells or neurons in the middle temporal area (MT/V5). To understand how visual information is transferred along this pathway, we have studied all three types of neurons, using a reverse correlation procedure to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution maps of activity for different motion stimuli. Most complex and MT cells showed strong second-order interactions, indicating that they were tuned for particular displacements of an apparent motion stimulus. The spatiotemporal structure of these interactions showed a high degree of similarity between the populations of V1 complex cells and MT cells, in terms of the spatiotemporal limits and preferences for motion and their two-dimensional spatial structure. Much of the structure in the V1 and MT second-order kernels could be accounted for on the basis of the first-order responses of V1 simple cells, under the assumption of a Reichardt or motion-energy type of computation.

Using confocal and electron microscopy, we found that prolonged morphine treatment increased the cell surface density of these perikaryal delta ORs and, by way of consequence, receptor-mediated internalization of the fluorescent deltorphin (DLT) analog omega-Bodipy 576/589 deltorphin-I 5-aminopentylamide (Fluo-DLT) in all three types of DRG neurons ( small, medium, and large). In contrast, chronic inflammatory pain induced by the injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into one hindpaw selectively increased Fluo-DLT internalization in small and medium-sized DRG neurons ipsilateral to the inflammation. Based on our previous studies in the spinal cord of mu-opioid receptor (mu OR) knock-out mice, it may be assumed that the enhanced membrane recruitment of delta ORs observed after sustained morphine is attributable to stimulation of mu ORs. However, the selectivity of the effect induced by inflammatory pain suggests that it involves a different mechanism, namely a modality-specific and pain-related activation of C and A delta fibers. Indeed, stimulation by capsaicin of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptors, which are selectively expressed by small diameter ( < 600 mu m(2)) DRG neurons, increased Fluo-DLT internalization exclusively in this cell population. The present results, therefore, demonstrate that DRG neurons express perikaryal delta ORs accessible to CSF-circulating ligands and that the density and, hence, presumably also the responsiveness, of these receptors may be modulated by both pain-related stimuli and sustained exposure to mu OR agonists.

Inhibitory influences ultimately converge on the cytoskeleton to mediate growth cone collapse and neurite outgrowth inhibition. Rho GTPase and its downstream effector Rho kinase are key signaling intermediates in response to MAIs; however, the links between Rho and the actin cytoskeleton have not been fully defined. We found that Nogo-66, a potent inhibitory fragment of Nogo-A, signals through LIM ( LIM is an acronym of the three gene products Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3) kinase and Slingshot (SSH) phosphatase to regulate the phosphorylation profile of the actin depolymerization factor cofilin. Blockade of LIMK1 activation and subsequent cofilin phosphorylation circumvents myelin-dependent inhibition in chick dorsal root ganglion neurons, suggesting that phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin is critical for neuronal inhibitory responses. Subsequent activation of SSH1 phosphatase mediates cofilin dephosphorylation and reactivation. Overexpression of SSH1 does not mimic the neurite outgrowth inhibitory effects of myelin, suggesting an alternative role in MAI inhibition. We speculate that SSH-mediated persistent cofilin activation may be responsible for maintaining an inhibited neuronal phenotype in response to myelin inhibitors.

In this paper, we report the predictive validity of a subtype classification scheme based on clinical and radiographic features. Methods: Nine Canadian memory clinics participated in the Consortium to Investigate Vascular Impairment of Cognition. This cohort consisted of 1347 patients, of whom 324 had VCI, and was followed for up to 30 months. Results: Clinical and neuroimaging features defined three subtypes: vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia, (n =97), vascular dementia (n=101) and mixed neurodegenerative/vascular dementia (n=126). Any ischemic lesion on neuroimaging increased the odds (odds ratio=9.31; 95% confidence interval 6.46, 13.39) of a VCI diagnosis. No VCI Subtype, however, was associated with a specific neuroimaging abnormality. Compared to those with no cognitive imipairment, patients with each VCI subtype had higher rates of death and I P institutionalization (hazard ratio for combined adverse events = 6.08, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Both clinical features and radiographic features help establish a diagnosis of VCI. The outcomes of VCI subtypes, however, are more strongly associated with clinical features than with radiographic ones. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The hypothesis for the novel methodology presented in this work is that pathologies will impact large tissue areas with detectable variations of T1-weighted MR signal intensity and registration metrics. The technique is applied to lateralization of seizure focus in 127 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), in which the site of seizure onset was determined by comprehensive evaluation (69 with left MTL seizure focus (SF) (group "L") and 58 with right SF (group "R")). The method analyses large, non-specific Volumes of Interest (VOI) centered on the left and right medial temporal lobes (MTL) (55 x 82 x 80 voxels) in pre-processed scans aligned in stereotaxic space. Extracted VOIs are linearly and nonlinearly registered to a reference target image. Principal Components Analyses of (i) the normalized intensity and (ii) the trace, a measure of local volume change, are used to generate a multidimensional reference space from a set of 152 neurologically healthy subjects. VOIs from TLE patients, processed in a similar fashion, are projected in this space, and leave-one-out, forward stepwise linear discriminant analysis of the eigencoordinate distributions is used for classification. Following manual MRI volumetric analysis, 80 patients had HC atrophy (group "HA") ipsilateral to the SF (42 with left SF or "LHA", and 38 with right or "RHA"), and the remaining 47 had normal HC volumes (group "HNV") (27 with left SF or "LNV", and 20 with right SF or "RNV"). The automated method was 100% accurate at separating "HA" vs. "HNV", "LHA" vs. "RHA", and "LNV" vs "RNV". It was also 96% accurate at separating "L" vs. "R". Our results indicate that MR data projected in multidimensional feature domains can lateralize SF in epilepsy patients with a high accuracy, irrespective of HC volumes. This single-scan, practical and objective method holds promise for the pre-surgical evaluation of TLE patients. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Resonance intensities of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) relative to creatine (Cr) were measured in a large central brain volume. NAA/Cr in NAWM was estimated by regression of the NAA/Cr in each voxel against white matter fraction and extrapolation to a white matter fraction of 1. The fractional size of the semi-solid pool (F) was obtained from the binary spin bath model of NIT by computing the model parameters from multiple NIT-weighted and relaxometry acquisitions. F in NAWM was significantly smaller in the patients [0.109 (0.009)] relative to controls [0.123 (0.007), P = 0.011], but did not differ between RR [0.1085] and SP [0.1087] patients [P > 0.99]. NAA]Cr and F in the NAWM were not correlated (r = 0.16, P > 0.7), mainly due to a lack of variation in F among patients. This may indicate a floor to the extent of myelin pathology that can occur in NAWM before a lesion appears, or that axonal damage is not strictly related to demyelination. The correlation between NAWM NAA/Cr and T2w lesion volume was not significant (P > 0.1). However, dividing the lesion volumes by the mean F in T2w lesions resulted in a quantity that correlated well with NAWM NAA/Cr (r = -0.78, P = 0.038), possibly reflecting the association of Wallerian degeneration in the NAWM with axonal transection associated with demyelination within lesions.

It is qualified as amodal when the form is placed behind an obstacle and modal when the form is at the foreground and closed by illusory contours. The N1, and sometimes the N2, deflections of the visual evoked potentials are known to be larger for modal figures, such as the Kanizsa triangle, than for control figures. This result is generally linked to completion or illusory contours, but it could also be related to a third process: the interpolation of the form by connecting its separate parts. To test the influence of interpolation, a modal triangle, an amodal triangle, a figure with outlined inducers, and a no-triangle figure were randomly presented to 26 subjects. The N1 evoked by the three triangle figures were all larger than the N1 to the no-triangle figure. These results suggest that the N1 amplitude is largely determined by the possibility of interpolating a form in the figure. The greatest NI to the modal figure further suggests that interpolation may be increased by modal completion and decreased by the features that diminish the saliency of triangle in the amodal figure and the figure with outlined inducers. On the other hand, the largest N2 was evoked by the amodal figure. This effect may index processes activated in response to the great difficulty in perceiving the triangle in the amodal figure, a difficulty that is initially caused by a conflict of perceptions characterizing this figure.

It has been shown recently that stimulation of the smooth-pursuit area of the FEF [ frontal pursuit area (FPA)] in monkey increases the pursuit response to unexpected changes in target motion during pursuit. In the current study, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the FPA and SEF in humans during sinusoidal pursuit to assess its effects on the pursuit response to predictable, rather than unexpected, changes in target motion. For the FPA, we found that TMS applied immediately before the target reversed direction increased eye velocity in the new direction, whereas TMS applied in mid-cycle, immediately before the target began to slow, decreased eye velocity. For the SEF, TMS applied at target reversal increased eye velocity in the new direction but had no effect on eye velocity when applied at mid-cycle. TMS of the control region ( leg region of the somatosensory cortex) did not affect eye velocity at either point. Previous stimulation studies of FPA during pursuit have suggested that this region is involved in controlling the gain of the transformation of visual signals into pursuit motor commands. The current results suggest that the gain of the transformation of predictive signals into motor commands is also controlled by the FPA.

However, its role in signal transduction after IGF-II binding remains unclear. In the present study, we report that IGF-II/M6P receptor in the rat brain is coupled to a G-protein and that its activation by Leu(27)IGF-II, an analog that binds rather selectively to the IGF-II/M6P receptor, potentiates endogenous acetylcholine release from the rat hippocampal formation. This effect is mediated by a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive GTP-binding protein and is dependent on protein kinase C alpha(PKC alpha)-induced phosphorylation of downstream substrates, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, and growth associated protein-43. Additionally, treatment with Leu(27)IGF-II causes a reduction in whole-cell currents and depolarization of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. This effect, which is blocked by an antibody against the IGF-II/M6P receptor, is also sensitive to PTX and is mediated via activation of a PKC-dependent pathway. These results together revealed for the first time that the single transmembrane domain IGF-II/M6P receptor expressed in the brain is G-protein coupled and is involved in the regulation of central cholinergic function via the activation of specific intracellular signaling cascades.

Monkeys performed a contour-grouping task in which they had to select a target curve and ignore a distractor curve. Some trials required a shift of attention, because the target and distractor curves were switched during the course of the trial. We monitored the dynamics of this attention shift in area VI, in which neuronal responses evoked by the target curve are stronger than those evoked by the distractor. The reallocation of attention was associated with a rapid and strong enhancement of responses to the newly attended curve, followed, after similar to 60 ms, by a weaker suppression of responses to the curve from which attention was removed. We conclude that attention can be rapidly allocated to a new object before it disengages from the previously attended one.

Spatial variability in intensities of multimodal MR images over the brain is explicitly modeled by building region-specific multivariate likelihood distributions. Local smoothness is ensured by incorporating neighboring voxel tissue information using Markov Random fields. A probabilistic measure of confidence for the classification is then presented, which can also be used to assess disease burden. The method was tested on 10 patients with MS by comparing automatically classified lesions, with and without regional information, to manual classifications by five expert raters using volume count and overlap. Results improve with the incorporation of spatial information, and are comparable to manual classifications. This method also enables a more accurate classification in the posterior fossa, where no other method reports success.

A new Direct Matrix Mapping Encoding (DMME) method is proposed to efficiently and effectively represent the architecture of a neural network. A modified Back propagation (BP) algorithm is utilized to tune the weights and other parameters of RANNs. The RANN optimized by this algorithm has been applied to the identification of nonlinear dynamic systems with unknown nonlinearities. Three types of RANN-based nonlinear models are proposed to describe the behavior of nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of these models and identification algorithms are extensively verified in the identification of several complex nonlinear systems such as "smart" actuator preceded by hysteresis, and friction plague harmonic drive.

New technique for the estimation of jitter and shimmer of voiced speech signal	2006 CANADIAN CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-5	Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	19th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	MAY 07-10, 2006	Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE		voiced speech; circular autocorrelation function; pitch-period; jitter; shimmer	SUSTAINED PHONATION	This paper presents a new technique for the estimation of jitter and shimmer exploiting the detected value of the pitch-period and amplitude of voiced speech signal degraded by white noise. Perturbations of the glottis cycle duration (jitter) and intonation (shimmer) are, respectively, the irregularities of pitch-period and energy. We propose a modified circular autocorrelation function (MCACF) of the normalized hamming-windowed pre-filtered speech. A weighted and pitch-harmonic MCACF is utilized to effectively extract pitch-period for jitter computation. To carry out shimmer analysis, peak-to-peak amplitude of signal around the estimated pitch-period is optimally obtained by matching the windowed pre-filtered speech frame with a shifted impulse train. For performance evaluation vowels, such as /a, e, i, o, u/, are used from the TIMIT database. The conventional algorithms manifest not only the distortion of pitch contours but also provides elevated values of the jitter and shimmer that can be interpreted as the presence of anomalies of the vocal tract, the glottis or the neuro-mechanism. On the contrary, for both clean and noisy speech, the proposed method results in a comparatively smooth pitch contour as well as small values of the jitter and shimmer confirming the presence of a normal voice with good stability and periodicity.

However, due to the scattering of the emitted photons, inherent to this imaging process, brain 3D SPECT images exhibit poor spatial and inter-slice resolution. More precisely, SPECT images are blurred, leading to substantial errors in measurement of regional brain activity and making difficult and subjective, a reliable and accurate diagnosis by the nuclear physician. In order to improve the resolution of these images and then to facilitate their interpretation, we herein propose an original extension of the NAS-RIF deconvolution technique of Kundur and Hatzinakos [1]. The proposed extension has two interesting properties; it allows to exploit or fuse anatomical and geometrical information extracted from a high resolution anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) image and also to efficiently incorporate, into the NAS-RIF method, a regularization term to stabilize the inverse solution. In our application, this anatomical-based regularization term exploits the result of an unsupervised Markovian segmentation obtained after a preliminary registration step between the MR and SPECT data volume coming from a same patient. This method has been successfully tested on numerous pairs of brain MR and SPECT images of different patients, yielding very promising restoration results.

The zigzag collarette area is selected as a personal identification pattern which captures only the most important areas of iris complex pattern and better recognition accuracy is achieved. The idea to use the zigzag collarette area is that it is insensitive to the pupil dilation and usually not affected by eyelids or eyelashes. The deterministic feature sequence is extracted from iris images using Gabor wavelet technique and used to train SVM as iris classifiers. The traditional SVM is modified as asymmetrical SVM to treat False Accept and False Reject differently to satisfy several security requirements. The parameters of SVM are tuned to improve overall system performance. Our experimental results also indicate that the performance of SVM as a classifier is far better than the performance of backpropagation neural network (BPNN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Hamming and Mahalanobis distance. The proposed innovative technique is computationally effective as well as reliable in term of recognition rate of 99.56%.

Through a comprehensive set simulations, it has been shown that this training strategy allows fuzzy ARTMAP to achieve a significantly lower generalization error than when it uses typical training strategies. Furthermore, the PSO strategy eliminates degradation of generalization error due to overtraining resulting from the training set size, number of training epochs, and data set structure. Overall results obtained with the PSO strategy reveal the importance of optimizing parameters and weights using a consistent objective function. In fact, the parameters found using this strategy vary significantly according to, e.g., training set size and data set structure, and always differ considerably from the popular choice of parameters that allows to minimize resources.

A new facial expression recognition technique using 2-D DCT and neural networks based decision tree	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE				Human facial expression recognition (FER) has attracted much attention in recent years because of its importance in realizing highly intelligent human-machine interfaces. In this paper, we propose a new FER technique that utilizes the 2-D DCT of full size facial images and a decision tree with feedforward neural network (NN) based nodes. The first NN-based node of the decision tree is designated to separate one group of facial expressions with members "smile" and "surprise" from another group that contains "anger" and "sadness". This node can reduce the confusion between the category members of the two groups. Two NN-based nodes that follow the first node are established for each group to separate their two members. As a result, the original recognition problem with four categories is divided into three subproblems, each having only two members to distinguish. This work is the first trial to use NN, decision tree and 2-D DCT simultaneously within a single recognition task. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed recognition technique, we use two databases, including a recently constructed one, which contain 2-D front face images of 60 men and 60 women, respectively. Experimental results reveal that the new technique outperforms, on the whole, the simple vector matching and K-means based vector matching techniques and two recently developed methods using fixed-size and constructive neural networks.

Solution over-fit occurs when the optimized classifier memorizes the training data sets instead of producing a general model. This paper compares two validation strategies used to control the over-fit phenomenon in classifier optimization problems. Both strategies are implemented within the multi-objective NSGA-H and MOMA algorithms to optimize a Projection Distance classifier and a Multiple Layer Perceptron neural network classifier, in both single and ensemble of classifier configurations. Results indicated that the use of a validation stage during the optimization process is superior to validation performed after the optimization process.	[Radtke, Paulo V.

Neural network-based actuator fault diagnosis for attitude control subsystem of an unmanned space vehicle	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			SYSTEMS	The main objective of this paper is to develop a neural network-based fault detection and isolation scheme (FDI) for the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of a satellite. Towards this end, two neural network architectures are considered. First, a dynamic neural network residual generator is constructed based on the Dynamic Multilayer Perceptron (DMLP) network to perform the detection task. A generalized embedded structure for the dynamic neuron model is considered in the DMLP network. Second, a static neural classifier is developed based on Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) network to be utilized for the isolation task. Based on a given set of input-output data collected from a 3-axis ACS of a satellite, the network parameters are adjusted to minimize a performance index specified by the output estimation error. The proposed neural FDI structure is applied to detect and isolate various faults in a high-fidelity nonlinear model of a satellite reaction wheel (RW), which is often used as an actuator in the ACS. The performance and capabilities of the proposed techniques are investigated and compared to a model-based observer residual generator that is used to detect various fault scenarios.

Specifically, the goal is to decide whether a bus voltage fault, a current loss fault or a temperature fault has occurred in one of the three reaction wheels and further to localize which wheel is faulty. In order to achieve these objectives, three dynamic neural networks are introduced to model the dynamics of the wheels on all three axes independently. Due to the dynamic property of the wheel, the architecture utilized is the Elman recurrent network with backpropagation learning algorithm. The effectiveness of this neural network-based FDI scheme is investigated and a comparative study is conducted with the performance of a generalized observer-based scheme. The simulation results have demonstrated the advantages of the neural network-based method proposed.	[Li, Z.

For example, in the development of the vertebrate visual system, molecular guidance cues that are largely activity-independent provide a rough topography of early projections, while activity-dependent refinement of termination zones occurs later on through correlated retinal activity. A key question concerns the nature of the interaction between these processes. Recent knockout experiments involving the beta 2 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) suggest that these two processes make genuinely separate contributions - but leave open the precise nature of their interaction. In this article we show how a novel, computational framework (dubbed INTEGRATE) can illuminate the scope and limits of the AI-AD interaction, including facts about critical periods and timing.

The proposed approach is based on decomposing the neural network into two subsystems. The first subsystem (Subsystem 1) consists of the estimation error and output-layer weight error and the second subsystem (Subsystem 2) consists of the hidden-layer weight error. The key to this decomposition is that the hidden-layer weights appear in Subsystem 1, only as an argument of a sigmoidal function and its derivative which are both known to be bounded. This allows us to regard the Subsystem 1 as a linear-in-parameter neural network (LPNN) whose stability proof is more straightforward. Having shown the stability of the first subsystem, the stability of the second subsystem is also shown subsequently without the requirement of having the limiting assumptions of previous work. The bound on estimation error can be made arbitrarily small by proper selection of design parameters. The estimation scheme is then employed to estimate the state of flexible joint manipulators.

Data compression is being efficiently used to process multichannel recordings. This paper explores Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) processor architectures suited to compress ENGs and so, increase the number of channels. Low power consumption, low silicon area and specificity of multichannel neural recording systems are considered for this investigation. Six architectures were implemented and compared. All of them implement a 3 level Daubechies-4 wavelet decomposition. This comparative study allows to conclude that an excellent trade-off between power consumption and silicon area is obtained through a DWT polyphase structure using a careful balance of parallelism and folding. Also, it arises that multiplexing several channels toward a shared DWT processor provides the best savings for both, power and area.

This amplifier achieves reduced size and lower power consumption, compared to previous designs, by means of a novel DC rejection scheme. DC rejection is achieved by an active integrator located in the feedback loop of the bioamplifier. It places; a highpass cutoff frequency within the transfer function, which is set by a small capacitor and a MOS-Bipolar equivalent resistor. This configuration rejects large DC offset and drift that exist at the electrode-electrolyte interface without the need for input RC networks or area consuming capacitors feedback networks, thus preserving the bioamplifier's high input impedance and small size. The proposed bioamplifier, designed in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process, provides a midband gain of 53 dB, passes the neural signal from 105 Hz; to 9.2 kHz and achieves an input-referred noise of 5 mu Vrms. It occupies less than 0.064 mm(2) and dissipates 8.4 mu W.

In order to succeed the compensation it's necessary to assure current control in the AC side of the APF and voltage or current control in the DC side of the APF. In real practice PI controllers are the most common, as a novel and intelligent control technique neural network controllers are under study and investigation in such application.

However, this relationship is still unable to be modeled. Here, artificial neural networks are the best to be used in such cases where input-output mappings are unknown or difficult to be modeled. The basic strategy for this paper is to use artificial neural networks for mapping power system signal energies into the power system transfer limits; i.e. to extract the relationship between power system transfer limits and the system signal energy. Primary results show that the neural network, after being trained, is able to accurately predict the power system transfer limit by looking to the signal energy measured at different buses in the system.

In general, for forecasting with a lead time of up to a few days ahead, load history (for the last few days) is not available, and therefore, estimated values of this load are used instead. However, a small error in these estimated values may grow up dramatically and lead to a serious problem in load forecasting since this error is fed back as an input to the forecasting procedure. In this paper, we demonstrate ANN capabilities in load forecasting without the use of load history as an input. In addition, only temperature (from weather variables) is used, in this application, where results show that other variables like sky condition (cloud cover) and wind velocity have no serious effect and may not be considered in the load forecasting procedure.

Virtual reality environments for rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke	2006 INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON VIRTUAL REHABILITATION			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Workshop on Virtual Rehabilitation (IWVR 2006)	AUG 29-30, 2006	New York, NY				EXPLICIT INFORMATION; LEARNING-PROCESSES; TRUNK RESTRAINT; MOTOR DEFICIT; IMPLICIT; ARM; HEMIPARESIS; RECOVERY; TASK; IMPAIRMENTS	We describe an immersive and interactive experimental protocol developed in a virtual reality environment using the CAREN system. The environment allows the user to receive enhanced feedback about the quality and outcome of varied pointing movements made in a virtual elevator. Features of the virtual environment (representation of the user's body movement; collision detection) as well as details about the feedback provided to the user (knowledge of, results and knowledge of performance) are outlined. The described training environment will be used in the rehabilitation of the upper limb for patients who have motor disorders due to stroke and other neurological conditions. The advantage of training upper limb pointing movements in this environment is that the task difficulty can be manipulated according to the user's level of motor impairment and the feedback can be manipulated to provide a more motivating and task-relevant training experience.

Twelve individuals with stroke and 12 healthy controls walked on a self-paced treadmill viewing a virtual corridor in a helmetmounted display. In experiment 1, the speed of an expanding OF was varied sinusoidally at 0.01711z, from 0 to 2 times the individual's comfortable walking speed. In experiment 2, individuals were instructed to walk through a virtual hallway of 10m at their comfortable pace (control trials). During the test trials that followed the control trials, expanding optic -flows ranging from 0.25 to 1.75 of the initial comfortable speed were randomly presented. Subjects were instructed to walk the test trial distance within the same time as during the preceding control trial. Results from experiment 1 showed that gait speed was modulated out-of-phase with respect to OF speed in the healthy controls, but it varied from out-of-phase to in-phase patterns in the individuals with stroke. A negative linear relationship was observed between gait speed and OF speed in healthy and stroke individuals in experiment 2. These results indicate that individuals with stroke, although able to modulate the gait speed by changing the perception of movement through different OF speeds, present with altered modulation response patterns as compared to healthy subjects.

Method: Patients with schizophrenia or a related disorder were consecutively enrolled from all regions of Canada. Both academic and community psychiatric clinics were included and patients were followed up for 2 years. Clinical and functional status, quality of life, medication and economic costs were assessed at enrollment and monitored throughout the follow-up period. Results: Patients attending an academic clinic tended to be younger and more severely ill than those from community clinics. Both types of sites prescribed atypical neuroleptics to more than three-quarters of the patients. The majority of those enrolled were unemployed and living in poverty. Poor clinical status was associated with poverty. Conclusion: The CNOMSS provides demographic, clinical and treatment-related information about a large Canada-wide sample of psychiatric patients. The following three articles in this issue of Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica explore issues related to medication, quality of life and resource utilization.

Bayesian framework is a consistent learning paradigm for a feed-forward neural network to infer knowledge from experimental data. Bayesian regularization automates the process of learning by pruning the unnecessary weights of a feed-forward neural network, a technique of which has been shown in this paper and applied to detect the glycosylation sites in epidermal growth factor-like repeat proteins involving in cancer as a case study. After applying the Bayesian framework, the number of network parameters decreased by 47.62%. The model performance comparing to One Step Secant method increased more than 34.92%. Bayesian learning produced more consistent outcomes than one step secant method did; however, it is computationally complex and slow, and the role of prior knowledge and its correlation with model selection should be further studied.

Canny's edge detection and the Hough transform are used to find the iris/pupil boundary and a simple thresholding method is employed for eyelash detection. The Gabor wavelet technique is deployed in order to extract the deterministic features in the transformed iris of a person in the form of template, The extracted iris features are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Our results indicate that the performance of SVM as a classifier is far better than the performance of a classifier based on the artificial neural network.

J	Ditto, B; Seguin, JR; Tremblay, RE				Ditto, B; Seguin, JR; Tremblay, RE			Neuropsychological characteristics of adolescent boys differing in risk for high blood pressure	ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE			English	Article							COGNITIVE FUNCTION; HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS; ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICATIONS; BARORECEPTOR STIMULATION; ADRENOCORTICAL RESPONSES; SPATIAL LOCATION; FRONTAL LOBES; PERFORMANCE; MEMORY; MEN	Background: Individuals with established hypertension have been found to display deficits in a number of neuropsychological abilities. In general, these are probably due to structural changes in the brain produced by sustained high blood pressure. However a potentially important line of research suggests that some of these deficits may extend to younger individuals with less severe elevations of blood pressure, perhaps even children, and thus be related more to risk for hypertension than hypertension per se. Purpose: The objective was to examine the relationships between neuropsychological function and risk for hypertension in children. Methods: Measurements of blood pressure and parental history of hypertension were obtained in 88 French-Canadian 14-year-old boys and used to predict performance on a neuropsychological battery. Results: Boys at greater risk of hypertension by virtue of having a parental history of high blood pressure and normatively elevated systolic blood pressure had significantly lower scores on a verbal learning factor score compared to boys at lower risk. Boys with normatively elevated systolic blood pressure also had significantly lower scores on a spatial learning and memory factor score compared to boys with lower blood pressure. The results could not be attributed to differences in family socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Using a younger sample than typically employed in the area, the results support previous suggestions that some of the neuropsychological characteristics displayed by hypertensive individuals may predate the development of clinically elevated blood pressure and could be associated with risk for the disorder.

J	Dempsey, EM; Barrington, K				Dempsey, EM; Barrington, K			Short and long term outcomes following partial exchange transfusion in the polycythaemic newborn: a systematic review	ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD-FETAL AND NEONATAL EDITION			English	Article							NEONATAL HYPERVISCOSITY; INFANTS	Background: Severe polycythaemia in the neonate may produce symptoms due to hyperviscosity and may be associated with serious complications. Partial exchange transfusion will reduce the packed cell volume. Objective: To determine whether partial exchange transfusion in term infants with polycythaemia (symptomatic and asymptomatic) is associated with improved short and long term outcomes. Search strategy: Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register of the Cochrane Library were searched. The following keywords were used: polycythaemia, partial exchange transfusion, hyperviscosity, and limited to the newborn. This covered years 1966-2004. Abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies and personal files were also searched. Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials in term infants with polycythaemia and/or documented hyperviscosity were considered. Clinically relevant outcomes included were short term (resolution of symptoms, neurobehavioural scores, major complications) and long term neurodevelopmental outcome. Data collection and analysis: All data for each study were extracted, assessed, and coded separately. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion. Main results: Six studies were identified; five had data that could be evaluated for analysis. There is no evidence of an improvement in long term neurological outcome (mental developmental index, incidence of mental delay, and incidence of neurological diagnoses) after partial exchange transfusion in symptomatic or asymptomatic infants. There is no evidence of improvement in early neurobehavioural assessment scores (Brazelton neonatal behavioural assessment scale). Partial exchange transfusion may be associated with an earlier improvement in symptoms, but there are insufficient data to calculate the size of the effect. Necrotising enterocolitis is probably increased by partial exchange transfusion (relative risk 8.68, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 71.1). Conclusion: There is no evidence of long term benefit from partial exchange in polycythaemic infants, and the incidence of gastrointestinal injury is increased. The long term outcome is more likely to be related to the underlying cause of polycythaemia.

The interhemispheric rivalry model of heminglect is well suited for such investigations, as simple predictions derived from clinical data can be tested without the caveats normally associated with lesion studies. One of these predictions is that release from contralateral inhibition should lead to increased parietal responsiveness, which, in turn, would enhance spatial attention. Here, we detail studies showing TMS-induced paradoxical functional facilitation of attention in healthy individuals and highlight their contribution to the understanding and treatment of neglect syndromes.

Although Stau1 is mostly described in association with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes in the cytoplasm, recent studies suggest that it may transit through the nucleus/nucleolus. Using a sensitive yeast import assay, we show that Stau1 is actively imported into the nucleus through a newly identified bipartite nuclear localization signal. As in yeast, the bipartite nuclear localization signal is necessary for Stau1 nuclear import in mammalian cells. It is also required for Stau1 nucleolar trafficking. However, Stau1 nuclear transit seems to be regulated by mechanisms that involve cytoplasmic retention and/or facilitated nuclear export. Cytoplasmic retention is mainly achieved through the action of dsRBD3, with dsRBD2 playing a supporting role in this function. Similarly, dsRBD3, but not its RNA-binding activity, is critical for Stau1 nucleolar trafficking. The function of dsRBD3 is strengthened or stabilized by the presence of dsRBD4 but prevented by the interdomain between dsRBD2 and dsRBD3. Altogether, these results suggest that Stau1 nuclear trafficking is a highly regulated process involving several determinants. The presence of Stau1 in the nucleus/nucleolus suggests that it may be involved in ribonucleoprotein formation in the nucleus and/or in other nuclear functions not necessarily related to mRNA transport.

Effect of body warming on regional blood flow distribution in conscious hypoxic one-month-old rabbits	BIOLOGY OF THE NEONATE			English	Article						anoxia; cardiovascular regulation; temperature; animal models; microspheres	UNANESTHETIZED NEWBORN LAMBS; CARDIAC-OUTPUT; NITRIC-OXIDE; HOT ENVIRONMENTS; OXYGEN-TRANSPORT; BRAIN-INJURY; RATS; HYPERTHERMIA; SHEEP; HYPEROXIA	Background: Previous experiments have shown that warming hypoxic infants reduces total peripheral vascular resistance. This suggests that the usual vasoconstriction of less essential vascular beds during hypoxia may be reduced and that the normal redistribution of blood flow to more vital organs may be compromised. Objective: Evaluate the effect of body warming during hypoxia on the distribution of blood flow. Methods: The fluorescent microsphere technique was used to compare regional blood flow in 1-month-old rabbits during systemic hypoxia (10% inspired O-2) with (n = 9) and without (n = 10) body warming. Blood flow was measured in brain, stomach, small intestine, hindlimb muscle, skin, and kidneys. Arterial blood pressure, whole-body O-2 consumption, arterial blood O-2 saturation and blood gases were also measured. Measurements and Main Results: In hypoxia all animals decreased body temperature (-2 degrees C). With hypoxia blood flow increased to brain and hindlimb muscle; decreased to stomach, small intestine, and kidneys, and was unchanged in skin. The increase in brain-blood flow maintained O-2 delivery at normoxic levels. Rewarming to the normoxic body temperature significantly changed blood flow in hypoxia. Brain blood flow increased by 102 +/- 30% (mean +/- SEM) thereby increasing O-2 delivery by 50 +/- 23% above normoxic values. Blood flow also increased to skin, stomach, and small intestine. However, O-2 delivery to these tissues remained below normoxic levels. Conclusions: Warming during hypoxia may impose an additional cardiovascular demand. The changes in the pattern of blood flow distribution with mild warming during hypoxia support the hypothesis that warming represents a significant heat stress.

Folate supplementation prevents the majority of NTDs, and a polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) has become recognized as a genetic risk factor. The mechanisms by which folate affects NTD development are unclear. The Splotch (Sp) mouse is a well-characterized mouse model for studying spontaneous NTDs. To assess the potential interaction between folate metabolism and the Sp mutant in NTD development, we studied mice with both Sp and Mthfr mutations, as well as the interaction between Sp and low dietary folate. METHODS: Wild-type, single Mthfr +/- mutant, single Sp/+ mutant, and double mutant (Mthfr +/-, Sp/+) female mice were mated with males of the same genotype. Embryos were examined for NTDs on gestational day (GD) 13.5. To investigate the effects of folate deficiency on Sp mice, Sp/+ female mice were fed a control diet (CD), a moderately folic acid-deficient diet (MFADD), or a severely folic acid-deficient diet (SFADD). They were mated with Sp/+ males and the embryos were examined. RESULTS: There were no differences in the incidence or severity of NTDs in embryos from double-mutant mating pairs compared to those from single Sp mutants. Embryos from Mthfr +/- dams did not exhibit NTDs. Diets deficient in folate did not influence the incidence or severity of NTDs in embryos from Sp/+ mice. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe an interaction between Sp and Mthfr mutations, or between the Sp mutation and low dietary folate, in NTD development in Splotch mice.

A production experiment was conducted to examine the ability of left- (LHD) and right- (RHD) hemisphere-damaged patients and normal controls to use temporal and fundamental frequency cues to disambiguate sentences which include one or more Intonational Phrase level prosodic boundaries. Acoustic analyses of subjects' productions of three sentence types-parentheticals, appositives, and tags-showed that LHD speakers, compared to RHD and normal controls, exhibited impairments in the control of temporal parameters signalling phrase boundaries, including inconsistent patterns of pre-boundary lengthening and longer-than-normal pause durations in non-boundary positions. Somewhat surprisingly, a perception test presented to a group of normal native listeners showed listeners experienced greatest difficulty in identifying the presence or absence of boundaries in the productions of the RHD speakers. The findings support a cue lateralization hypothesis in which prosodic domain plays an important role. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In contrast, Trks (Tropomyosin-related kinases) and related receptors in the Trk superfamily, Rors (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptors), Musks (muscle specific kinases) and Ddrs (discoidin domain receptor family), appear to be ancient, but their function has been lost in multiple lineages and the roles for the receptors have been modified over time. We will trace the evolution of the Trk superfamily and discuss possible conserved functional roles, including a unifying theme of target recognition by growing axons. We present an analogy between the evolution of G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), proposing that an important driving force for the divergence of receptors is the ease of divergence of their ligands.

However, longevity is often extended in large-brained species, possibly compensating for delayed maturation. We examined the relationship between brain size and life history periods in cetaceans, a large-brained mammalian order that has been largely ignored. We looked at males and females of twenty-five species of Odontocetes, using independent contrasts and multiple regressions to disentangle possible phylogenetic effects and inter-correlations among life history traits. We corrected all variables for body size allometry and separated life span into adult and juvenile periods. For females and both sexes combined, gestation, time to sexual maturity, time as an adult and life span were all positively associated with residual brain size in simple regressions; in multiple regressions, maximum life span and time as an adult were the best predictors of brain size. Males showed few significant trends. Our results suggest that brain size has co-evolved with extended life history periods in Odontocetes, as it has in primates and birds, and that a lengthened adult period could have been an important component of encephalization in cetaceans.

Thirty subjects with moderate or severe TBI were compared to 30 normal controls on the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB-R), a dimensional measure of borderline traits, the Go-no go inhibition task, the Complexity of Representations of People and Affect-Tone Relationships Paradigms, two scales from the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (SCORS) evaluating the quality of object relations, an estimation of pre-morbid borderline severity, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and various neuropsychological measures. Results indicate that TBIs present more borderline symptoms and traits than controls. However, the severity of borderline symptomatology remains comparatively low for the vast majority. As expected, the TBI group showed a poorer performance on the Go-no go task, a characteristic neuropsychological inhibition deficit. Yet, both samples present similar profiles on the SCORS. Finally, the DIB-R was correlated with the Affect-Tone scale, the BDI and with the pre-morbid severity estimation. Results suggest that post-TBI borderline traits remain rare and relate more to the affective quality of object relations, negative affects and pre-morbid borderline pathology than inhibition deficits.

Adrenal insufficiency impacts on the haemodynamic management of patients in intensive care. Very little is known about the incidence of adrenal insufficiency in the first 10 days after traumatic brain injury. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 113 traumatic brain injury patients within 10 days of their injury. They all had a high-dose corticotropin stimulation test performed because of haemodynamic instability. Blood cortisol concentrations were measured at baseline, 30 and 60 min after the administration of high-dose corticotropin. The incidence of adrenal insufficiency was determined according to various definitions used in the literature. Results. The baseline cortisol concentration was < 414 nmol litre(-1) (15 mu g dl(-1)) in 78% of patients and < 690 nmol litre(-1) (25 mu g dl(-1)) in all patients. The cortisol concentration did not rise above 500 nmol litre(-1) (18 mu g dl(-1)) at 30 and 60 min in 49 and 22% of patients, respectively. The cortisol concentration did not rise by 250 nmol litre(-1) (9 mu g dl(-1)) at 30 and 60 min in 48 and 25% of patients respectively. Primary adrenal insufficiency defined by an abnormal baseline cortisol concentration and an abnormal response to the high-dose corticotropin stimulation test was present in 13-28% of patients according to the cut-off values used. Conclusions. The incidence of adrenal insufficiency varies from 25 to 100% in the first 10 days after traumatic brain injury. The range of incidences reported illustrates the need for standardization of the definition of adrenal insufficiency. This has a direct impact on treatment. Sampling at 60 min after the high-dose corticotropin stimulation test seems to correlate better with the maximum secreting capacity of the adrenal glands.

It is not known, however, whether any G6PT functions are involved in tumorigenesis. We investigated the effects of CHL and the potential role of G6PT in regulating the invasive phenotype of brain tumor-derived glioma cells. Results: RT-PCR was used to show that, among the adult and pediatric brain tumor-derived cells tested, U-87 glioma cells expressed the highest levels of G6PT mRNA. U-87 cells lacked the microsomal catalytic subunit glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)-alpha but expressed G6Pase-beta which, when coupled to G6PT, allows G6P hydrolysis into glucose to occur in non-glyconeogenic tissues such as brain. CHL inhibited U-87 cell migration and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 secretion, two prerequisites for tumor cell invasion. Moreover, CHL also inhibited cell migration induced by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a potent mitogen for glioblastoma multiform cells, as well as the rapid, S1P-induced extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase phosphorylation potentially mediated through intracellular calcium mobilization, suggesting that G6PT may also perform crucial functions in regulating intracellular signalling. Overexpression of the recombinant G6PT protein induced U-87 glioma cell migration that was, in turn, antagonized by CHL. MMP-2 secretion was also inhibited by the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-depleting agents 2-deoxyglucose and 5-thioglucose, a mechanism that may inhibit ATP-mediated calcium sequestration by G6PT. Conclusion: We illustrate a new G6PT function in glioma cells that could regulate the intracellular signalling and invasive phenotype of brain tumor cells, and that can be targeted by the anticancer properties of CHL.

The introduction of connexin genes into tumor cells reverses the proliferative characteristics of such cells. However, there is very little comparative information on the effects of different connexins on cancer cell growth. We hypothesized that Cx26, Cx32, or Cx43 would display differential growth suppression of C6 glioma cells and uniquely modulate the bystander effect following transduction of C6 cells with HSVtk followed by suicide gene therapy. The bystander phenomenon is the death of a greater number of tumor cells than are expressing the HSVtk gene, presumably due to the passage of toxic molecules through gap junction channels. To test this hypothesis, we used retroviral vectors to infect C6 glioma cells producing connexin-expressing and HSVtk-expressing cell lines. All three connexin-expressing cell lines grew significantly slower than GFP-infected or native C6 cells. Cx32 and Cx26 were significantly more effective at mediating the bystander effect in cocultures of C6-connexin cells with C6-HSVtk cells. These studies indicate that connexins have unique properties that contribute to their tumor suppressive function.

One of the great challenges is to discover the interdependency of these two factors and the mechanisms which sculpt dendrites' fine morphological details. We found a novel form of neurite growth behavior in neuronal cultures of the hippocampus and cortex, when axons and dendrites grew directly toward neurite-neurite contact sites and crossed them, forming multi-neurite intersections (MNIs). MNIs were found at a frequency higher than obtained by computer simulations of randomly distributed dendrites, involved many of the dendrites and were stable for days. They were formed specifically by neurites originating from different neurons and were extremely rare among neurites of individual neurons or among astrocytic processes. Axonal terminals were clustered at MNIs and exhibited higher synaptophysin content and release capability than in those located elsewhere. MNI formation, as well as enhancement of axonal terminal clustering and secretion at MNIs, was disrupted by inhibitors of synaptic activity. Thus, convergence of axons and dendrites to form MNIs is a non-random activity-regulated wiring behavior which shapes dendritic trees and affects the location, clustering level and strength of their presynaptic inputs.

J	Poyhia, R; Vainio, A				Poyhia, R; Vainio, A			Topically administered ketamine reduces capsaicin-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						ketamine gel; capsaicin; hyperalgesia; allodynia; volunteer	SECONDARY HYPERALGESIA; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; INTRAVENOUS ALFENTANIL; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; HUMAN VOLUNTEERS; ORAL KETAMINE; RAT; AMITRIPTYLINE; ALLODYNIA	Background: The n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists such as ketamine relieve chronic pain but their oral and parenteral use is limited by the adverse effects. Experimental studies indicate that the peripheral n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors are involved in nociception. Recent clinical findings suggest that ketamine gel alleviates neuropathic pain, but no placebo-controlled randomized studies are available on the neurosensory effects of ketamine gel in experimental neurogenic pain. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of topically applied ketamine using the intradermal capsaicin model in healthy volunteers. Methods: Nine healthy subjects received ketamine and placebo gel on 3 occasions in a randomized, double-blind, and crossover manner. The concentration of ketamine was 50 mg/mL. One milliliter of gel was rubbed into the skin of both forearms 10 minutes before the intra-dermal injection of capsaicin (250 mu g). Thereafter, the intensity and unpleasantness of spontaneous and evoked pain and dysesthesia was assessed up to 60 minutes using a 10-cm visual analog scale. Pain and dysesthesia were evoked using cotton gauze, a von Frey microfilament, and 38 degrees C, 42 degrees C, and 47 degrees C heat. Side effects were recorded, and individuals' subjective experiences were assessed with a standard questionnaire. Results: Ketamine gel had no effect on immediate burning pain followed by the capsaicin injection. Both the intensity and unpleasantness of mechanical hyperalgesia was statistically significantly reduced by ketamine gel applied both on the left and right side. Neither tactile allodynia evoked by a brush nor thermal hyperalgesia were observed in any volunteer. No local or systemic side effects were observed. No patient reported any drug effects. Discussion: A significant reduction of mechanical hyperalgesia was produced by topically and pre-emptively applied ketamine in healthy patients. We propose that the mechanism of action would be the reduction of central sensitization caused by the absorption of ketamine in circulation.

Methods: Multimodal psychophysical examination of the patient's affected and nonaffected foot included thermal sensibility, dynamic touch, and directional sensibility. In addition, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study cortical representation of brush-evoked allodynia. Results: Detailed psychophysical examination revealed substantial deficits in warm, cool, and tactile perception on the injured foot. These findings indicated severe dysfunction of perceptual processes mediated by A beta, A delta, and C fibers. Despite reduced tactile perception, light touch evoked a deep burning pain in the foot. Functional magnetic resonance imaging during brushing of the patient's injured foot showed that tactile allodynia led to activation of several cortical regions including secondary somatosensory cortex, anterior and posterior insular cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Brushing of the patient's nonaffected foot led to fewer activated regions. Discussion: The profound sensory disturbances suggest a possible deafferentation type of tactile allodynia mediated by changes within the central nervous system, such as a disruption of normal tactile or thermal inhibition of nociception. The functional magnetic resonance imaging data suggest that tactile allodynia is represented in similar brain regions as experimental pain.

Several clozapine augmentation strategies have come into clinical practice although often without evidence-based support. Among these strategies, the combined use of clozapine with another antipsychotic has been reported for up to 35% of patients receiving clozapine. Objective: The purposes of the present work were to (1) review the available literature on the efficacy and safety of the clozapine augmentation with another antipsychotic using a MEDLINE search of the literature from 1978 to December 2005 and (2) to propose an operational definition of schizophrenia refractory to clozapine ('' ultraresistant schizophrenia '') for the implementation and homogenization of future therapeutic trials. Conclusion: Case controls and open clinical trials largely dominate the literature, and there are only 4 double-blind studies of clozapine augmentation with antipsychotics. The results of these studies are somewhat discrepant. Moreover, the heterogeneity of definitions of resistance to clozapine, of outcome measures and of dose and duration of pharmacological trials is a major limitation for drawing conclusions.

Methods: Among 64 tested patients, 40 had EEG spikes during scanning and were divided in two groups: unilateral or bilateral independent spikes (29 patients) and bilaterally synchronous spikes (I I patients). Each spike topography was analyzed separately, yielding 40 studies in the first group and 17 in the second. Results: Forty-five percent of focal spike studies showed significant BOLD responses. Cortical activation (positive BOLD) represented the dominant response and had a better correlation with spike location than cortical deactivation (negative BOLD). In the second group, all patients had significant BOLD responses; they were more widespread compared to the first group, and deactivated areas were as important as activated regions. A thalamic response was seen in 12.5% of studies in the first group and 55% in the second. Conclusions: The thalamus is involved in partial epilepsy during interictal discharges. This involvement and also cortical deactivation are more commonly seen with bilateral spikes than focal discharges. Significance: These findings show evidence for a role for the thalamus and a more important role for inhibition in secondary bilateral synchrony.

J	Barrington, KJ; Finer, NN				Barrington, KJ; Finer, NN			Inhaled nitric oxide for respiratory failure in preterm infants	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PREMATURE-INFANTS; DISTRESS-SYNDROME; PULMONARY CIRCULATION; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; PLATELET-AGGREGATION; BIRTH; INHALATION; DISEASE; NEWBORN	Background Inhaled nitric oxide has been proven effective in term infants with hypoxic respiratory failure. The pathophysiology of respiratory failure, and the potential risks, differ substantially in preterm infants. Analysis of the efficacy and toxicities of inhaled nitric oxide in infants born before 35 weeks is therefore necessary. Objectives To determine whether, in preterm newborn infants (< 35 weeks gestation) who have hypoxic respiratory failure, treatment with inhaled nitric oxide improves oxygenation within 2 hours and reduces the rates of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, or neurodevelopmental disability Search strategy Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), using the following keywords: nitric oxide, clinical trial, newborn, and covering years from 1985 to 2005. In addition, we searched the abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasi randomised studies in preterm infants with hypoxic respiratory failure. Administration of inhaled nitric oxide compared to control with or without placebo. Clinically relevant outcomes that were analysed included death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postconceptional age), intraventricular haemorrhage, long term neurodevelopmental outcome and short term effects on oxygenation. Data collection and analysis Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. Two investigators extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Main results Seven randomised controlled trials of inhaled nitric oxide therapy in preterm infants were found. One study consisted of infants determined to have a high risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Subhedar 1997). One study studied routine use of inhaled NO in all ventilated preterm infants (Schreiber 2003). The remaining studies consisted of infants with high predicted mortality based on poor oxygenation (Kinsella 1999; Hascoet 2005; INNOVO 2005; Van Meurs 2005; Mercier 1999). No significant effect of inhaled nitric oxide on mortality or bronchopulmonary dysplasia was demonstrated. There was no evidence of effect on the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage. There may be short term improvements in oxygenation. Two studies (Schreiber 2003; INNOVO 2005) have so far presented data on long term neurodevelopmental outcome, one of which demonstrated improved outcome at two years corrected age. Authors' conclusions The currently published evidence from randomised trials does not support the use of inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants with hypoxic respiratory failure. Further studies may need to be performed to evaluate the potential benefit of routine use of this therapy in infants with milder forms of respiratory failure, and these trials will need to be designed to evaluate not only neonatal survival, and the occurrence of neonatal morbidities, but should be powered to evaluate neurodevelopmental outcome at a minimum of two years of age.

QNGM reported to the Minister of Social Affairs and operated under an umbrella of universal health insurance in the province. The Network's programs have been run by members of the four university medical schools of the province under the direction of a central committee. A global annual budget was awarded to QNGM from its inception. Among its many programs, QNGM supported: (1) two newborn screening programs (using blood and urine samples) for early diagnosis, treatment and research in phenylketonuria, hereditary tyrosinemia, congenital hypothyroidism, and in a large number of other hereditary metabolic diseases; (2) follow-up of confirmatory diagnostic tests at regional centers, followed by supervision of ambulatory treatment modalities; (3) carrier screening and reproductive counseling for Tay-Sachs and beta-thalassemia diseases; (4) a spectrum of feasibility (research) studies (e.g., screening for biotinidase deficiency, neuroblastoma, hemoglobinopathies, and cystic fibrosis) to inform policy decisions. QNGM performed economic analyses of its major programs and followed prevailing ethical guidelines. Its global budget and integrated structure terminated in 1994, although some of its programs continue independently. Copyright (C) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Traditional forestry objectives aimed at sustainable yield are being replaced with those of sustainable ecosystem management. Such a shift in forest management requires an effective transfer of results from forest researchers to managers. In order to predict the potential impacts of changes in environment (such as climate, land-use, fire disturbance and forest harvesting) on the sustainability of forest ecosystems, forest resource managers will require forest simulation models. Forest simulation models have a long history in forestry and have proven to be useful tools for forest management. There have been two basic approaches to modeling forest growth and dynamics: empirical and mechanistic forest simulation models. This chapter reviews and compares four major types of forest simulation models: (1) growth and yield models (empirical approach), (2) succession models (empirical-mechanistic hybrid approach), (3) process models (mechanistic approach), and (4) hybrid models. Their applications are described in four case studies. The advantages and disadvantages of the different modeling approaches are discussed. Case studies deal with predicting future forest conditions under different management options, simulating the potential effects of climate change, and effects of fire disturbance on structure and function of forest ecosystems in Canada. There is still a gal) between foresters and ecologists in developing and using forest simulation models. There will not be a single, super model that will satisfy all of the diverse demands and purposes simultaneously. Diversified modeling approaches integrated into a decision-support system, an important tool for evaluating the sustainability of forest ecosystem in a changing environment, are emphasized.

This study investigates the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and evaluates the therapeutic effect of albumin dialysis in ALF with use of the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System without hemofiltration/dialysis (modified, M-MARS). Methods: Pigs were randomized into three groups: sham, ALF, and ALF + M-MARS. ALF was induced by hepatic devascularization (time = 0). M-MARS began at time = 2 and ended with the experiment at time = 6. ICP, arterial ammonia, brain water, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and plasma inflammatory markers were measured. Results: ICP and arterial ammonia increased significantly over 6 hrs in the ALF group, in comparison with the sham group. M-MARS attenuated (did not normalize) the increased ICP in the ALF group, whereas arterial ammonia was unaltered by M-MARS. Brain water in the frontal cortex (grey matter) and in the subcortical white matter at 6 hrs was significantly higher in the ALF group than in the sham group. M-MARS prevented a rise in water content, but only in white matter. CBF and inflammatory mediators remained unchanged in all groups. Conclusion: The initial development of cerebral edema and increased ICP occurs independently of CBF changes in this noninflammatory model of ALF. Factor(s) other than or in addition to hyperammonemia are important, however, and may be more amenable to alteration by albumin dialysis.

Baseline data indicated that some patients had symptoms suggestive of concomitant Lewy body disease. This retrospective analysis investigated whether AD patients with and without symptoms suggesting concomitant Lewy body pathology demonstrated different responses to therapy. Methods: AD patients were divided by the presence/absence of symptoms suggestive of concomitant Lewy body disease. These were identified by a concomitant diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies and/or use of anti-parkinsonian medication at baseline. Baseline characteristics, demographics, changes on efficacy parameters and adverse event (AE) frequencies were calculated for rivastigmine- and donepezil-treated patients. Efficacy parameters were the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and AD Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL). Main efficacy analyses were based on an intent-to-treat last observation carried forward (ITT-LOCF) population. Results: Both populations reached mean doses of rivastigmine and donepezil that were within therapeutic ranges. Nine hundred and ninety-four AD patients received study drug, of whom 49 (4.9%) had symptoms suggestive of concomitant Lewy body disease (25 rivastigmine, 24 donepezil). In this subpopulation, changes from baseline after 2 years of treatment with rivastigmine were significantly better than those seen with donepezil on the SIB, MMSE and ADCS-ADL (ANCOVA or Wilcoxon analyses, p < 0.05, ITT-LOCF). Statistical significance was not maintained in non-ITT-LOCF analyses, except for EP analyses on the SIB and ADCS-ADL (both p < 0.05). Rivastigmine also provided significantly better functioning than donepezil in patients without Lewy body pathology, as shown by a significant treatment difference at endpoint on the ADCS-ADL (p < 0.05, ITT-LOCF; not maintained in non-ITT-LOCF analyses). NPI changes from baseline did not differ significantly between treatment groups. AD patients with symptoms suggestive of concomitant Lewy body disease receiving rivastigmine or donepezil experienced fewer gastrointestinal side effects, leading to fewer discontinuations due to AEs, compared with patients without Lewy body pathology. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis, AD patients who had symptoms suggestive of concomitant Lewy body disease appeared to show greater treatment responses to rivastigmine than to donepezil, and experienced fewer adverse events under either drug, compared with patients without Lewy body pathology.

Mechanisms of immune mediated demyelination in the CNS	CURRENT TOPICS IN NEUROIMMUNOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference of Neuroimmunology	OCT 15-19, 2006	Nagoya, JAPAN				CD8(+) T-CELLS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; THERAPY; INJURY; NKG2D	Immune mediated demyelination in the CNS reflects the properties of the effectors and cellular targets of the injury process. Adaptive immune constituents (alpha beta CD8 T cells, antibody) can selectively recognize target antigens. Under inflammatory conditions, alpha beta T cells can acquire expression of surface molecules usually associated with innate immune effectors, permitting antigen/MHC unrestricted interaction with neural cells that up-regulate expression of the requisite ligands. Soluble factor mediated injury can also depend on interaction with receptors on target cells and the resultant signaling responses. Recurrent or persistent injury combined with failure of repair or replacement mechanisms may underlie progressive demyelination.

Outcomes of cognitively impaired not demented at 2 years in the Canadian Cohort Study of Cognitive Impairment and Related Dementias	DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						dementia; cognitively impaired not demented; mild cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's disease; longitudinal cohort; ApoE	ILLNESS RATING-SCALE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; DIAGNOSIS; HEALTH; CONSORTIUM; CRITERIA	Background: People who are cognitively impaired not demented (CIND) can be at an increased risk for developing dementia, but little is known about the natural history of CIND in clinical settings. Method: We examined the 2-year outcome of CIND subjects in the Canadian Cohort Study of Cognitive Impairment and Related Dementias. CIND was diagnosed when at least one positive item was endorsed on the DSM-III-R dementia criteria, but not all criteria were met. CIND was further subclassified as: pre-Alzheimer's disease (pre-AD), vascular cognitive impairment (VCI-ND), non-AD degenerative, psychiatric, other neurologic, other medical conditions, mixed disorders and no etiology identified ( not otherwise specified [ NOS]). Result: Of 146 CIND patients with 2-year follow-up data available, 49 (34%) progressed to dementia, while 20 (14%) recovered to not cognitively impaired (NCI). Progressors were significantly older than stable CIND and reverters ( p < 0.0001; mean age = 71.1, 64.3, and 59.1, respectively), and there were significantly ( p = 0.001) more ApoE epsilon 4 carriers among progressors (67%) than stable CIND (29%) and reverters (12%). Pre-AD CIND and VCI-ND had the highest rate of conversion to dementia (41.0 and 40.0%, respectively), while psychiatric CIND and CIND NOS had highest rate of recovery to NCI (20.0 and 30.0%, respectively). All conversions in pre-AD CIND were to 'probable AD'. Conclusion: CIND consists of a heterogeneous group of disorders that can be classified syndromically. Many subclassess - not just those with pre-AD CIND - are at high risk of progression to dementia, usually to Alzheimer's disease. Copyright (C) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Topographical patterns of lobar atrophy in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease	DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th Annual Meeting of the American-Neuropsychiatric-Association	FEB 21-24, 2004	Bal Harbour, FL	Amer Neuropsychiat Assoc		fronto-temporal dementia; lobar atrophy topography; volumetry	PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE APHASIA; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; CARD SORTING TEST; SEMANTIC DEMENTIA; BRAIN ATROPHY; SUNNYBROOK DEMENTIA; PICK COMPLEX; WORK GROUP; MRI	Background/Aims: Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) designates a group of relatively common neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this study was to characterize the patterns of brain atrophy in FTD compared to Alzheimer's disease ( AD). Methods: A novel semiautomatic volumetric MRI analysis method was applied to measure regional brain volumes in FTD ( n = 15; behavioural variant n = 9, language variant n = 6) in contrast with AD patients ( n = 15) and age-matched controls (NC) ( n = 15). FTD and AD patients were matched on demographic measures and Mini Mental State Examination scores. Results: Significant atrophy was present in the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of subjects with FTD compared to AD ( p = 0.02; effect size = 1.11) and compared to NC (p < 0.001; effect size = 1.86). Severe atrophy of the left anterior temporal region distinguished the language variant. AD patients, by contrast, did not differ from NC for frontal lobe volume but had smaller anterior temporal lobes ( p = 0.03). Both dementia groups had medial temporal lobe atrophy of similar magnitude. A logistic regression model including 4 regional measures correctly classified 100% of subjects. Conclusion: FTD can be reliably differentiated from AD by virtue of a topographical pattern of atrophy involving the frontal lobes and anterior temporal regions. Medial temporal lobe volumes do not distinguish FTD from AD. Copyright (C) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Recently, a number of homeodomain transcription factors have been identified as critical regulators of this process. Here, we show that the homeoprotein engrailed 1 (EN1) is expressed during embryonic and perinatal craniofacial bone development, where it localizes to the skeletogenic mesenchyme, and, subsequently, to calvarial osteoblasts and osteoprogenitors. Mice lacking En1 exhibit generalized calvarial bone hypoplasia and persistent widening of the sutural joints. A reduction in calvarial membranous bone deposition and mineralization (osteopenia) is coupled to enhanced osteolytic resorption in En1 mutants. Consistent with these observations, expression of established osteoblast differentiation markers reveals that Enl function is required for both early and late phases of calvarial osteogenesis. Further analysis shows that EN1 regulates FGF signaling in calvarial osteoblasts. Moreover, EN1 indirectly influences calvarial osteoclast recruitment and bone resorption by regulating the expression of receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts. Thus, during intramembranous bone formation, EN1 acts both cell autonomously and non-cell autonomously. In summary, this study identifies EN1 as a novel modulator of calvarial osteoblast differentiation and proliferation, processes that must be exquisitely balanced to ensure proper skull vault formation.

Methods: The primary objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the ability of investigators to adhere to the clinical protocols of care including the cooling and rewarming procedures as well as management guidelines in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale <= 8) treated with 24 h of hypothermia therapy. A secondary objective was to evaluate the ability of study research assistants to complete the study case report form using a procedures manual. The study was conducted at 18 sites in Canada, the United Kingdom and France prior to proceeding to a randomized controlled trial (RCT). After 2 patients were enrolled at each center, an independent clinical evaluation committee examined the process of care and the completeness of data collection. Centers were permitted to enroll patients in the RCT once they met pre-established adherence criteria. Results: Seventeen of the 18 centers completed the pretrial clinical evaluation phase demonstrating compliance with study procedures and proceeded to an RCT of hypothermia therapy. One center enrolled only 1 patient in the pretrial clinical evaluation phase due to small numbers of patients with traumatic brain injury, and therefore, did not proceed to the RCT. Three centers were required to enroll more than 2 patients in the pretrial clinical evaluation phase prior to proceeding to the RCT because of problems with adherence to the clinical protocols at two centers and the training of new study personnel at another center. Of the 39 patients enrolled during the pretrial clinical evaluation phase, 8 (20.5%) died and 22 (62.9%) had a good outcome defined as normal, mild or moderate disability assessed using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score at 6 months following injury. Discussion: The pretrial clinical evaluation phase was useful to ensure compliance with complex hypothermia therapy and consensus-based clinical management guidelines of care successfully implemented across 17 of 18 centers. This study maneuver allowed us to complete a subsequent RCT in 225 children following severe traumatic brain injury. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Despite immense importance of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in the phenomenology of schizophrenia, the neurocognitive and neurophysiological bases of AVHs remain obscure. On the neurocognitive level, it has been proposed that AVHs arise from the disordered monitoring manifested by patients' inability to recognize their inner speech as being their own. On the neurophysiological level, the AVHs have been attributed to the aberrant activity in the primary auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus). Although interesting, these models cannot account for the very specific and restricted content of AVHs in individual patients. The specific content of AVHs persists across different psychotic episodes even after extended periods of remission. Furthermore, the AVHs are usually triggered by emotionally charged and stressful situations. Design. We hypothesized that even during absence of AVHs, when patients are in remission, the verbal content remains present in the latent, pre-clinical form. In order to elucidate potential cerebral substrates of the dormant AVHs content, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 6 schizophrenia patients in total remission of AVHs for at least 12 months, during listening to the words hallucinated by them in the past. Specifically, we created the list of previously hallucinated words for each patient and matched the words in terms of length, structure, emotional valence, semantic category and frequency of usage with the non-hallucinated words. Moreover, each patient was paired demographically with the control participant who was presented with the same words. We predicted that exposure to the hallucinated versus non-hallucinated words would result in increased activation in cerebral areas associated with cognitive and emotional content of previously experienced AVHs in patients, whereas the same comparison will not produce any significant changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in control participants. In addition, based on existing neuroimaging data obtained during experience of AVHs, we hypothesized that previously hallucinated words may elicit greater activation in the primary auditory cortex than the non-hallucinated words in patients. Each pair of participants was analyzed separately. Results. The most consistent finding in patients, absent in all control participants, was significant activation in the orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) during listening to previously hallucinated versus nonhallucinated words. The orbitofrontal and medial PFC are both part of corticolimbic system and play an important role in cognitive control of emotion processing. Discussion. Thus, present results imply that previously hallucinated words, even in remission, are associated with inappropriate emotional response on neurophysiological level in schizophrenia patients. The relative hyperactivation of orbitofrontal and medial PFC inpatients may stem from and/or may contribute to anomalous neural plasticity and disordered connectivity in the corticolimbic circuitry. This in turn could lead to attribution of excessive emotional salience to normally neutral stimuli and over time via process of sensitization could result in hallucinations. Potential normalization of this dysfunction could reduce patients' susceptibility to experience AVHs in stressful situations. In addition to observed hyperactivations in the PFC, some schizophrenia patients exhibited anomalous BOLD signal in other regions of the corticolimbic system such as anterior cingulate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. Thee additional anomalies could be related to greater affective sensitivity to the hallucinated versus non-hallucinated words in some patients. Conclusion. Finally, in contrast to our initial hypothesis we did not observe any significant differences between processing of the hallucinated versus non-hallucinated words in the primary auditory cortex. In retrospect, this result is not surprising because patients did not experience internally generated AVHs while in the scanner, but instead were exposed exclusively to externally generated stimuli.

The aim of the evaluation is to determine disease-related and treatment-related effects on cognition and behavior in order to orient therapeutic interventions, by taking into account the compensatory mechanisms that are available to the patient. Examples of the tests best illustrating the classical neuropsychological protocol are presented. Neuropsychology also plays an important role in the assessment of language lateralization in patients slated for epilepsy surgery. Traditionally, this has been achieved by means of the rather invasive Wada procedure. However, with the advent of new neuroimaging techniques, this procedure is gradually being replaced by minimally invasive or noninvasive methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and optical imaging. In the present paper, we discuss some of the newer techniques that are available to the neuropsychologist for the study of the impact of epilepsy on cerebral functioning.

OVA protein was detected in a tissue- and cell-specific manner in these "ODC-OVA" mice. Without immunization, CD4 T cells and B cells remained ignorant of the neo-self antigen expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), as indicated by unimpaired development and lack of activation of OVA/IA(b)-specific TCR transgenic T cells in these mice, and the ability to mount normal OVA-specific recall and antibody responses. Upon immunization with OVA in complete Freund's adjuvant, about half of the transgenic mice developed neurological symptoms characteristic of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mononuclear infiltrates in the brain and spinal cord contained both macrophages and T cells, similar to classical models of EAE induced by immunization with CNS antigens in adjuvant. The wealth of immunological reagents available to study and manipulate the OVA-specific response should make this new model useful for the investigation of components and mechanisms involved in CNS-specific autoimmunity.

In the present study, we have undertaken experiments to identify which calcium-independent isoform of PLA(2) is involved in synaptic plasticity and to determine whether calcium-independent PLA(2) (iPLA(2)) contributes to post-synaptic processes of LTP. Using field recordings from rat CA1 hippocampal slices, we found that theta-burst stimulation (TBS)-induced LTP of field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) was abolished by the iPLA(2) inhibitor bromoenol lactone (BEL) but not by the Ca2+-dependent PLA(2) inhibitor arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF(3)). The ionic currents generated during TBS were not affected during iPLA(2) inhibition as BEL by itself had no effect on the magnitude of facilitation during burst responses. In addition, (R)-BEL, an enantioselective inhibitor of iPLA(2)gamma, precluded TBS-induced LTP, an action that was not replicated by the iPLA(2)beta inhibitors (S)-BEL and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate. (R)-BEL was, however, ineffective on pre-established LTP. Finally, BEL also prevented the potentiation of fEPSPs elicited by brief exposure to 50 mu M N-methyl-D-aspartate, as well as the associated up-regulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptor GluR1 subunit levels and the increase of H-3-AMPA binding in crude synaptic fractions. Collectively, these results unravel a new role for iPLA(2)gamma in LTP, which appears to favor the insertion of AMPA receptors at post-synaptic membranes.

Here, we provide a systematic analysis of the patterns of activity in cMRF neurons during head unrestrained gaze shifts. Two types of cMRF neurons were found: presaccadic neurons began to discharge before the onset of gaze movements, while postsaccadic neurons began to discharge after gaze shift onset and typically after the end of the gaze shift. Presaccadic neuronal responses were well correlated with gaze movements, while the discharge of postsaccadic neurons was more closely associated with head movements. The activity of presaccadic neurons was organized into gaze movement fields, while the activity of postsaccadic neurons was better organized into movement fields associated with head displacement. We found that cMRF neurons displayed both open and closed movement field responses. Neurons with closed movement fields discharged before a specific set of gaze (presaccadic) or head (postsaccadic) movement amplitudes and directions and had a clear distal boundary. Neurons with open movement fields discharged for gaze or head movements of a specific direction and also for movement amplitudes up to the limit of measurement (70 degrees). A subset of open movement field neurons displayed an increased discharge with increased gaze shift amplitudes, similar to pontine burst neurons, and were called monotonically increasing open movement field neurons. In contrast, neurons with non-monotonically open movement fields demonstrated activity for all gaze shift amplitudes, but their activity reached a plateau or declined gradually for gaze shifts beyond specific amplitudes. We suggest that presaccadic neurons with open movement fields participate in a descending pathway providing gaze signals to medium-lead burst neurons in the paramedian pontine reticular formation, while presaccadic closed movement field neurons may participate in feedback to the superior colliculus. The previously unrecognized group of postsaccadic cMRF neurons may provide signals of head position or velocity to the thalamus, cerebellum, or spinal cord.

The movement fields of pre-saccadic neurons were most closely associated with gaze displacement. The movement fields of post-saccadic neurons were most closely associated with head displacement. Here we examine the relationships of the discharge patterns of these cMRF neurons with the temporal aspects of gaze or head movement. For pre-saccadic cMRF neurons with monotonically open movement fields, we demonstrate that burst duration correlated closely with gaze duration. In addition, the peak discharge of the majority of pre-saccadic neurons was closely correlated with peak gaze velocity. In contrast, discharge parameters of post-saccadic neurons were best correlated with the time of peak head velocity. However, the duration and peak discharge of post-saccadic discharge was only weakly related to the duration and peak velocity of head movement. As a result, for the majority of post-saccadic neurons the discharge waveform poorly correlated with the dynamics of head movement. We suggest that the discharge characteristics of pre-saccadic cMRF neurons with monotonically open movement fields are similar to that of direction long-lead burst neurons found previously in the paramedian portion of the pontine reticular formation (PPRF; Hepp and Henn 1983). In light of their anatomic connections with the PPRF, these pre-saccadic neurons could form a parallel pathway that participates in the transformation from the spatial coding of gaze in the superior colliculus (SC) to the temporal coding displayed by excitatory burst neurons of the PPRF. In contrast, closed and non-monotonically open movement field pre-saccadic neurons could play a critical role in feedback to the SC. The current data do not support a role for post-saccadic cMRF neurons in the direct control of head movements, but suggest that they may serve a feedback or reafference function, providing a signal of current head amplitude to upstream regions involved in head control.

In addition to its key function as an extracellular space-filling scaffold, the ECM is also implicated in the formation of important cell-cell and cell-ECM (i. e. juxtacrine) interactions that subsequently provide key regulatory signals that influence cellular proliferation and viability, differentiation, specialization and gene expression. Regulated turnover of the ECM, a process largely mediated by the tightly controlled matrix metalloprotease (MMP) enzyme family, is critical to a number of physiological processes involved in growth and development while aberrant turnover of matrix components is associated with congenital and metabolic diseases. The following review will focus on the transcriptional aspects of MMP gene expression, particularly in diseased states.

Several proteins associated with this degenerating myelin are inhibitory to axon growth and therefore prevent severed axons from regenerating. Inflammatory agents such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can stimulate both the migration and phagocytic activity of macrophages. Using in situ hybridization, we found that the expression of the LPS membrane receptor, CD14, was enhanced in the mouse dorsal column following a dorsal hemisection. Double labeling studies showed that microglia and macrophages are the two major cell types expressing CD14 mRNA following spinal cord injury (SCI). We therefore tested whether systemic injections of LPS would increase the number and phagocytic activity of macrophages/microglia in the ascending sensory tract (AST) of the mouse dorsal column following a dorsal hemisection. Mice were treated daily via intraperitoneal injections of either LPS or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At 7 days post-SCI, greater numbers of activated mononuclear phagocytes were present in the AST undergoing Wallerian degeneration (WD) in LPS-treated animals compared with controls. Animals treated with LPS also exhibited greater Oil Red O staining, which is specific for degenerating myelin and macrophages phagocytosing myelin debris. Myelin clearance was confirmed at 7 days using Luxol Fast Blue staining and on toluidine blue-stained semi-thin sections. These results indicate that it is possible to manipulate the innate immune response to accelerate myelin clearance during WD in the injured mouse spinal cord. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Rats either received sham or neurotoxic lesions of the HPC 1 or 14 days after learning that contacting a wire-wrapped probe (i.e., object) elicits a shock. After recovery from the surgery, rats were re-exposed to the wire-wrapped probe and burying and avoidance of the probe were assessed and used as memory and fear indices. Regardless of the learning-to-surgery interval, the rats with hippocampal lesions buried and avoided the probe significantly less than sham rats and no more than rats that never experienced shock from the probe. These findings suggest that the lesions caused severe retrograde amnesia and that the HPC has a long-lasting role in memory of a discrete stimulus associated with a fear-eliciting event.

Cooperation and competition between the dorsal hippocampus and lateral amygdala in spatial discrimination learning	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						radial maze; discrimination; inactivation; muscimol; conditioned-cue-preference; neural systems; hippocampus; amygdala	MULTIPLE MEMORY-SYSTEMS; CONFIGURAL DISCRIMINATIONS; DORSOLATERAL STRIATUM; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; HABIT FORMATION; PLACE CELLS; HUMAN BRAIN; WATER-MAZE; RATS	The conditioned cue preference (CCP) was used to study how rats discriminate between adjacent arms on a radial maze. Chai and White (Behav Neurosci 2004, 118:770-784) showed that an intact dorsal hippocampus is required to learn this discrimination and that an amygdala-based conditioned approach response that produces an equal tendency to enter both arms is simultaneously acquired. In the present experiments, rats were preexposed to the maze with no food and trained by alternately confining them at the ends of two adjacent arms, one that contained food and one that did not. When given a choice between these arms with no food present, the rats spent more time on their food-paired arms, suggesting they had learned to discriminate their locations. Temporary inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus with muscimol during confinement on the food-paired arm had no effect on the discrimination, but inactivation while on the no-food arm impaired it. This pattern of effects was reversed in rats with amygdala lesions (inactivation on the food-paired arm impaired, but inactivation on the no-food arm had no effect on the discrimination), showing that hippocampus-based and amygdala-based learning interact to influence the behavior of normal rats in this situation. The dorsal hippocampus learns about locations that contain food and about locations that do not contain food. The amygdala-based tendency to enter the food-paired arm cooperates with hippocampus-based foraging for food on the food-paired, but the amygdala-based tendency to enter the no-food arm competes with hippocampus-based learning about the absence of food on that arm.

Comparative data were obtained from age-matched nonepileptic controls (NEC). Subicular neurons in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (EC) slices of epileptic rats were: (i) hyperexcitable when activated by CA1 or EC inputs; and (ii) generated spontaneous postsynaptic potentials at higher frequencies than NEC cells. Analysis of pharmacologically isolated, GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials revealed more positive reversal potentials in epileptic tissue (-67.8 +/- 6.3 mV, n = 16 vs. -74.8 +/- 3.6 mV in NEC, n = 13; P < 0.001) combined with a reduction in peak conductance (17.6 +/- 11.3 nS vs. 41.1 +/- 26.7 nS in NEC; P < 0.003). These electrophysiological data correlated in the epileptic subiculum with (i) reduced levels of mRNA expression and immunoreactivity of the neuron-specific potassium-chloride cotransporter 2; (ii) decreased number of parvalbumin-positive cells; and (iii) increased synaptophysin (a putative marker of sprouting) immunoreactivity. These findings identify an increase in network excitability within the subiculum of pilocarpine-treated, epileptic rats and point at a reduction in inhibition as an underlying mechanism.

Effects of early high-dose levothyroxine treatment on auditory brain event-related potentials at school entry in children with congenital hypothyroidism	HORMONE RESEARCH			English	Article						congenital hypothyroidism; event-related potential; brain development	THYROID-HORMONE REPLACEMENT; L-THYROXINE; CORTEX; ATTENTION; BEHAVIOR; INFANTS; PERCEPTION; LATERALITY; ADVANTAGE; LEVEL	Aims: We tested whether brain event-related potentials (ERPs) are normal in children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH) after early high-dose levothyroxine treatment. Methods: Auditory ERPs were recorded in 33 normal controls and in 15 children with CH at 5 years 9/12. Based on bone maturation at diagnosis, the CH group was divided into severe (n = 8) and moderate (n = 7) subgroups. CH patients were treated at a median age of 14 days with a mean initial dose of levothyroxine of 11.6 mu g/kg(.)day. Two ERP components (N100 and N200)were measured and clinical follow-up variables collected. Results: The functional anatomical and cognitive organisation of the auditory system, as revealed by the analyses of ERP measures, did not differ between CH and controls, or between severe and moderate CH subjects. However, N200 latency was globally longer in the CH than in the control group (p = 0.01) and was positively correlated with the over-treatment index (r = 0.61; p < 0.05) and verbal IQ. N200 amplitude was negatively correlated with initial dose (r = -0.74; p < 0.005). Conclusion: These data suggest that sensitive tools such as ERPs can reveal differences between CH and controls and relate these differences to the adequacy of treatment of CH. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

J	Liu, ZL; Svoboda, J				Liu, ZL; Svoboda, J			A new control scheme for nonlinear systems with disturbances	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						disturbance observer (DO); fuzzy neural network; learning control systems; nonlinear systems; time-varying systems; wing rock phenomenon	OBSERVER; DESIGN	A new learning control scheme, based on a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) coupled with a sliding-mode fuzzy neural network (SFNN) with a feedback-error-learning (FEL) strategy, is proposed for a class of time-varying nonlinear systems with unknown disturbances. The proposed controller, referred to as NDOFEL, involves two steps for obtaining an estimate of the time-varying lumped disturbance d(t) for improving the precision of the tracking control. The NDO is initially applied to estimate d(t), but an observer error does not converge to zero since (d) over dot(t) not equal 0. The SFNN is then presented to estimate the observer error such that the output of systems follows a desired trajectory. The proposed NDOFEL has stable on-line learning ability, maintains high control performance in the presence of disturbance, and guarantees the stability of closed-loop systems on the basis of the Lyapunov, theorem. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed NDOFEL is demonstrated through simulation results obtained for the tracking control during wing rock phenomena. The results suggest that the proposed controller can significantly enhance the tracking performance of aircraft.

However, few research efforts have addressed the issue of multistep vector pattern recognition. We propose a model that can perform multi step pattern recognition without the need for a special learning algorithm, and with the capacity to learn more than two pattern series in the training set. The model can also learn pattern series of different lengths and, contrarily to previous models, the stimuli can be composed of gray-level images. The paper also shows that by adding an extra autoassociative layer, the model can accomplish one-to-many association, a task that was exclusive to feedforward networks with context units and error backpropagation learning.

Unlike most previous neural network observers, the proposed observer uses a nonlinear-in-parameters neural network (NLPNN). Therefore, it can be applied to systems with higher degrees of nonlinearity without any a priori knowledge about system dynamics. The learning rule for the neural network is a novel approach based on the modified backpropagation (BP) algorithm. An e-modification term is added to guarantee robustness of the observer. No strictly positive real (SPR) or any other strong assumption is imposed on the proposed approach. The stability of the recurrent neural network observer is shown by Lyapunov's direct method.. Simulation results for a flexible-joint manipulator are presented to demonstrate the enhanced performance achieved by utilizing the proposed neural network observer.

The syncytiotrophoblast represents the specialized unit in the placenta that is directly involved in fetal nutrition, mainly involving essential nutrients, such as lipids, amino acids, and calcium. This ion is of particular interest since it is actively transported by the placenta throughout pregnancy and is associated with many roles during intrauterine life. At term, the human fetus has accumulated about 25-30 g of calcium. This transfer allows adequate fetal growth and development, since calcium is vital for fetal skeleton mineralization and many cellular functions, such as signal transduction, neurotransmitter release, and cellular growth. Thus, there are many proteins involved in calcium homeostasis in the human placenta.

Chaos theory has been reported to simulate partial functions (i.e., neuronal activity in brain) of the Human Visual System. In this work, we propose a chaotic synchronization-based method to identify semantic entities in surveillance scenes. MPEG-7 visual Descriptors(Ds) are used to extract low-level features of video objects. These objects are generated per video frame by segmentation and tracking. The chaotic synchronization is used to perform feature binding (i.e., group semantically relevant feature elements)from these Ds. The objective is to search for unique numeric descriptions (based on low-level features) to identify semantic entities. The idea of a semantic space is introduced to explain feature binding from multiple features spaces. Subjective result evaluation of our results show the existence of such numeric description for related semantic entities (e.g., male, female, enter deposit, take object, two person meet).

The idea stems from human beings functional architecture that gives them the ability to do more as they age and gain more experience. With the knowledge that classical controllers lack sufficient generality to cope with nonlinear as well as uncertain phenomenon such as turbulent air, the focuse is on different types of intelligent controllers due to their learning and nonlinear generalization capabilities as candidates for the landing flight phase. It is shown that the latter class of controllers could be used to enable the aircraft to learn and gain experience as they land more and more in gusty conditions. This capability enables the aircraft to land in conditions slightly more severe than previous experiences, and hence, as far as the landing phase is concerned, the flight envelop is expanded as the aircraft ages. In this regard, five controllers including a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) plus three intelligent controllers, in addition to an adaptive one, are presented and compared, based on neural networks and fuzzy logic concepts. The robustness and performance of the controllers are evaluated by applying two different strong wind patterns for two levels of performance.

The present study examined the relationships among measures of worry, intolerance of uncertainty, intolerance of ambiguity, perfectionism, and perceived control in a sample of 197 university students. The findings indicated that intolerance of uncertainty moderately overlaps with earlier conceptualizations of intolerance of ambiguity; however, worry was more highly related to intolerance of uncertainty than to intolerance of ambiguity. Intolerance of uncertainty also emerged as the most salient predictor of worry compared to other cognitive processes such as perfectionism and perceived control. Worry and intolerance of uncertainty continued to be significantly related after controlling for intolerance of ambiguity, perfectionism, and perceived control, which implies that intolerance of uncertainty shares a unique association with worry that is not accounted for by these other cognitive factors. Overall, the findings provide evidence of construct validity and underscore the role of intolerance of uncertainty in the conceptualization of worry. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Increased perceptual expertise may be implicated in the choice of special ability in savant autistics, and in the variability of apparent presentations within PDD (autism with and without typical speech, Asperger syndrome) in non-savant autistics. The overfunctioning of brain regions typically involved in primary perceptual functions may explain the autistic perceptual endophenotype.

Central to our review is how characteristic perceptual abilities, referred to as perceptual signatures, can be used to suggest a neural etiology that is specific to autism. We review evidence from studies assessing both motion and form perception and how the resulting perceptual signatures are interpreted within the context of two main hypotheses regarding information processing in autism: the pathway- and complexity-specific hypotheses. We present evidence suggesting that an autism-specific neural etiology based on perceptual abilities can only be made when particular experimental paradigms are used, and that such an etiology is most congruent with the complexity-specific hypothesis.

Tasks involving simple material (pure tones) and/or low-level operations (detection, labelling, chord disembedding, detection of pitch changes) show a superior level of performance and shorter ERP latencies. In contrast, tasks involving spectrally- and temporally-dynamic material and/or complex operations (evaluation, attention) are poorly performed by autistics, or generate inferior ERP activity or brain activation. Neural complexity required to perform auditory tasks may therefore explain pattern of performance and activation of autistic individuals during auditory tasks.

Observably atypical social behaviors early in the development of children with autism have led to the contention that autism is a condition where the processing of social information, particularly faces, is impaired. While several empirical sources of evidence lend support to this hypothesis, others suggest that there are conditions under which autistic individuals do not differ from typically developing persons. The present paper reviews this bulk of empirical evidence, and concludes that the versatility and abilities of face processing in persons with autism have been underestimated.

Patients and Methods Patients with brain metastases from solid tumors and a Karnofsky performance score of >= 70 were randomly assigned to receive WBRT with supplemental oxygen and either efaproxiral at 75 or 100 mg/kg efaproxiral arm) or no efaproxiral (control arm). The primary end point was survival. Results The study consisted of 515 eligible patients (efaproxiral arm, n = 265; control arm, n = 250), The median survival time (MST) was 5.4 months for the efaproxiral arm versus 4.4 months for the control arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87; P = 16), For the subgroup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer, the MST was 6.0 and 4.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.82; P =.07). Cox multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the efaproxiral arm in both primary populations, Further analysis indicated that the benefit may be restricted to the subgroup of patients with breast cancer, Response rates (radiographic complete response plus partial response) improved by 7% (P = 10) and 13% (P = 01) for all patients and for NSCLC and breast cancer patients in the efaproxiral arm, respectively, The most common severe adverse event in patients treated with efaproxiral was hypoxemia, which was reversible and effectively managed with supplemental oxygen in most patients. Conclusion The addition of efaproxiral, a noncytotoxic radiation sensitizer, to WBRT may improve response rates and survival in patients with brain metastases, particularly metastases from breast cancer, A confirmatory trial for breast cancer patients has been initiated.

We intensified a five-drug therapy (ifosfamide, etoposide alternated with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) using filgrastim but not stem-cell support, We studied topotecan alone and combined with cyclophosphamide in therapeutic windows before the five-drug therapy, A randomly assigned proportion of patients received amifostine as a cytoprotective agent. Patients and Methods Eligible patients were <= 30 years old and had histologically proven Ewing sarcoma or primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and metastasis at diagnosis, Chemotherapeutlic cycles began every 21 days, after recovery from toxicities. Results One hundred ten of the 117 patients enrolled were eligible. Thirty-six patients received initial topotecan. Three had partial responses (PRs), and 17 had progressive disease (PD), Thirty-seven patients were administered topotecan and cyclophosphamide; 21 of these patients achieved PR, and one patient had PD. In a randomly assigned group of 69 patients, amifostine did not provide myeloprotection, which was measured by absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, or cycle intervals. The best responses to the overall therapy included 45 complete responses, 41 PRs, stable disease in 14 patients, and PD in five patients, For all patients, the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 24% ( +/- 4%), and the overall survival rate was 46% ( +/- 5%). For the 39 patients with isolated pulmonary metastases, the 2-year EFS rate was 31% ( +/- 7%) compared with 20% ( +/- 5%) for patients with more widespread disease. Conclusion Topotecan had limited activity in patients with Ewing sarcoma or PNET metastatic at diagnosis. The topotecan-cyclophosphamide combination was active. Arnifostine was not myeloprotective, Overall results showed no improvement compared with previous Studies.

Applying brain emotional learning algorithm for multivariable control of HVAC systems	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; IDENTIFICATION	In this paper, we apply a modified version of Brain Emotional Learning (BEL) controller for Heating, Ventilating and AirConditioning (HVAC) control system whose multivariable, nonlinear and non-minimum phase nature makes the task difficult. The proposed biologically-motivated algorithm achieves robust and satisfactory performance even though there are more than one control inputs to the plant, which may be used to get the desired performance. The response time is also very fast despite the fact that the control strategy is based on satisfying decision making. The proposed strategy is very flexible and alternative performance specifications can easily be enforced via defining proper emotional cues.

To identify components of Staufen2-containing granules, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. A mouse fetal cDNA library was screened with the N-terminal fragment of Staufen2 as bait. ZFR, a three zinc finger protein, was identified as an interacting protein. Confocal microscopy showed that ZFR, although mainly nuclear, was also found in the somatodendritic compartment of primary hippocampal neurons where it localized as granule-like structures. Co-localization with Staufen2 was observed in several granules. Biochemical analyses (immunoprecipitation, cell fractionation) further confirmed the ZFR/Staufen2 association. ZFR was shown to interact with at least the Staufen2(62) isoform, but not with Staufen1. ZFR also co-fractionated with ribosomes and Staufen2(59) and Staufen2(52) in a sucrose gradient. Interestingly, knockdown expression of ZFR through RNA interference in neurons relocated specifically the Staufen2(62), but not the Staufen2(59), isoform to the nucleus. Our results demonstrate that ZFR is a native component of Staufen2-containing granules and likely plays its role during early steps of RNA transport and localization. They also suggest that one of these roles may be linked to Staufen2(62)-containing RNA granule formation in the nucleus and/or to their nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling.

The homeobox transcription factor Pitx3 is similarly and selectively expressed in the same neurons. Pitx3 deficiency in a natural mouse mutant, the aphakia mouse, was correlated with the loss of these neurons and with a deficit in locomotor activity. We now report that the locomotor deficit of aphakia mice is established by 40 days of age and that it can be rescued by injection of L-dopa. We further show that downstream striatal correlates of the midbrain neuronal losses in aphakia mice, as assessed by dopamine transporter binding and expression of dopamine receptors, enkephalin, dynorphin and neurotensin, are highly similar to neuroadaptive responses observed following rapid neurodegeneration induced by neurotoxin administration in adult animals or following the progressive neurodegenerative processes as seen in Parkinson patients. Taken collectively, these data support the idea that the aphakia mice represent a selective model of dopaminergic deficiency that closely resembles the midbrain and striatal neuropathology associated with Parkinson's disease, and this suggests that these mice are a good model to assess therapies for Parkinson's disease as well as to understand the susceptibility of these neurons to neurodegeneration.

In this paper, we report the characterization of the first Aplysia D-1-like dopamine receptor (Ap(dop1)) mainly expressed in the CNS, heart and buccal mass. Following expression of the Ap(dop1) receptor in HEK293 cells, a higher level of cAMP was observed in the absence of the receptor ligand, showing that Ap(dop1) is constitutively active. This activity was blocked by the inverse agonist flupentixol. Application of dopamine (EC50 of 35 nM) or serotonin (EC50 of 36 mu M) to Ap(dop1)-transfected HEK293 cells further increased the level of cAMP, suggesting that the receptor is linked to the stimulatory G(s) protein pathway. When expressed in cultured sensory neurons, Ap(dop1) immunoreactivity was observed in the cell body and neurites. Control sensory neurons responded to dopamine with a decrease in excitability mediated by a pertusis toxin-sensitive G protein. Expression of Ap(dop1) produced an increase in hyperpolarization in the absence of agonist and an increase in membrane excitability following stimulation by dopamine. In the presence of pertussis toxin to inhibit the G(i) protein inhibitory pathway responsible for decrease in excitability mechanism, Stimulation of membrane excitability was observed. Ap(dop1) sensitivity to dopamine makes it a potential modulator of operant conditioning procedure.

J Neurophysiol 95: 284-300, 2006. First published September 14, 2005; doi: 10.1152/jn. 01329.2005. The smooth pursuit system must integrate many local motion measurements into a coherent estimate of target velocity. Several laboratories have studied this integration process using eye movements elicited by targets, such as tilted bars, containing conflicts between local motion signals measured along contours [one dimensional (1D)] and those measured at the bar's endpoints, or terminators [two dimensional (2D)]. The general finding is that 1D signals dominate early responses, whereas later components of the behavior are determined by 2D signals. We studied the dynamics of the integration process in macaque monkeys by systematically varying the relative proportions of 1D and 2D signals and the retinal eccentricities at which they appeared. Predictably, longer bars produced greater and longer-lasting contour-induced deviations. The evolution of the 2D response occurred over a period of 50 - 400 ms, depending on the relative proportions of 1D and 2D signals. As contours were displaced from the fovea the deviation decreased but much less so for early (1st 40 ms) than for late (subsequent 40 ms) pursuit initiation. These bottom-up effects could be overcome to a limited extent by the top-down influence of predictability. Finally, we observed that when animals were free to track any part of the bar, they spontaneously made short-latency saccades to the terminators on most trials, especially when the bars were tilted. This suggests an increased saliency of moving terminators, particularly when discrepancies exist among local motion signals.

J Neurophysiol 95: 401-417, 2006. First published October 5, 2005; doi:10.1152/jn.00844.2005. We have examined the localization and activity of the neural circuitry that generates swimming behavior in developing zebrafish that were spinalized to isolate the spinal cord from descending brain inputs. We found that addition of the excitatory amino acid agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA) to spinalized zebrafish at 3 days in development induced repeating episodes of rhythmic tail beating activity reminiscent of slow swimming behavior. The neural correlate of this activity, monitored by extracellular recording comprised repeating episodes of rhythmic, rostrocaudally progressing peripheral nerve discharges that alternated between the two sides of the body. Motoneuron recordings revealed an activity pattern comprising a slow oscillatory and a fast synaptic component that was consistent with fictive swimming behavior. Pharmacological and voltage-clamp analysis implicated glycine and glutamate in generation of motoneuron activity. Contralateral alternation of motor activity was disrupted with strychnine, indicating a role for glycine in coordinating left-right alternation during NMDA-induced locomotion. At embryonic stages, while rhythmic synaptic activity patterns could still be evoked in motoneurons, they were typically lower in frequency. Kinematic recordings revealed that prior to 3 days in development, NMDA was unable to reliably generate rhythmic tail beating behavior. We conclude that NMDA induces episodes of rhythmic motor activity in spinalized developing zebrafish that can be monitored physiologically in paralyzed preparations. Therefore as for other vertebrates, the zebrafish central pattern generator is intrinsic to the spinal cord and can operate in isolation provided a tonic source of excitation is given.

J	Yi, JH; Hoover, R; McIntosh, TK; Hazell, AS				Yi, JH; Hoover, R; McIntosh, TK; Hazell, AS			Early, transient increase in complexin I and complexin II in the cerebral cortex following traumatic brain injury is attenuated by N-acetylcysteine	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						antioxidant; complexin; excitoxicity; fluid-percussion, neurotransmitter; traumatic brain injury	NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE; SNARE COMPLEX; VESICLE EXOCYTOSIS; AMINO-ACIDS; 2 ISOFORMS; RAT; MODEL; EXPRESSION; PROTEINS; DEPLETION	Alteration of excitatory neurotransmission is a key feature of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in which extracellular glutamate levels rise. Although increased synaptic release of glutamate occurs at the injury site, the precise mechanism is unclear. Complexin I and complexin II constitute a family of cytosolic proteins involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, competing with the chaperone protein alpha-SNAP (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein) for binding to the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin as well as the synaptic membrane proteins SNAP-25 and syntaxin, which together form the SNAP receptor (SNARE) complex. Complexin I is predominantly a marker of axosomatic (inhibitory) synapses, whereas complexin II mainly labels axodendritic and axospinous synapses, the majority of which are excitatory. In order to examine the role of these proteins in TBI, we have studied levels of both complexins in the injured hemisphere by immunoblotting over a time period ranging from 6 h to 7 days following lateral fluid-percussion brain injury in the rat. Transient increases in the levels of complexin I and complexin II proteins were detected in the injured cerebral cortex 6 h following TBI. This increase was followed by a decrease of complexin I in the injured cortex and hippocampus, and a decrease in both complexins in the injured thalamus region at day 3 and day 7 post-injury. The early, transient increase in the injured cortex was completely blocked by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administered 5 min following trauma, suggesting an involvement of oxidative stress. Neuronal loss was also reduced in the injured hemisphere with post-TBI NAC treatment. Our findings suggest a dysregulation of both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission following traumatic injury that is responsive to antioxidant treatment. These alterations in complexin levels may also play an important role in neuronal cell loss following TBI, and thus contribute to the pathophysiology of cerebral damage following brain injury.

This prospective study was conducted to investigate whether or not neuromotor impairments evident acutely persist long-term. Study design A total of 94 infants with CHD were reassessed at school entry (age 64.2 +/- 11.3 months) by blinded examiners using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale and neurologic examination. Results Neurologic abnormalities were noted in 28.4% of the subjects, with hypotonia and developmental delay most commonly observed. Microcephaly was documented in 15.4% of subjects, with head circumference > 50th percentile in only 14.1%. Mean gross and fine motor quotients were shifted downward (82.7 +/- 12.3 and 86.2 +/- 16.3, respectively), and gross and fine motor delays were prevalent (49.4% and 39.0%, respectively). Severe disability was rare (< 5%). Predictors of neurologic impairment included type of surgery (palliative/corrective), abnormal postoperative neurologic examination, and presence of microcephaly at initial surgery. Gross motor delay was more likely if palliated. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest time, palliative surgery, microcephaly, and number of hospitalizations were associated with fine motor delay. Conclusions Neurologic impairments and motor delay are common in survivors of open-heart surgery, persisting to age of school entry. Early indicators of medical complications and acute neurologic compromise are associated with increased risk. Early identification and intervention may optimize performance in those at risk.

The continuity of the maturative process from the fetus to the neonate allows us to speculate on the predictive value of optimal and non-optimal neurological function as observed in the fetus and their morphological consequences. Neonatologists know that early prediction concerning outcome is reliable only at the two ends of the spectrum, e.g., optimal and very abnormal situations. However, in intermediate situations the quality of observations achieved by 3D-4D ultrasonography already allows to demonstrate the prenatal onset of brain damage, based on morphologic and functional signs. Their identification during the second half of pregnancy may serve as a retrospective marker of a prenatal insult.

Advances in neuroimaging have contributed greatly to this growth. We reviewed the role that structural and functional neuroimaging techniques have played in elucidating the cerebral bases of the cognitive deficits associated with HD. We conducted a computer-based search using PubMed and PsycINFO databases to retrieve studies of patients with HD published between 1965 and December 2004 that reported measures on cognitive tasks and used neuroimaging techniques. Structural neuroimaging has provided important evidence of morphological brain changes in HD. Striatal and cortical atrophy are the most common findings, and they correlate with cognitive deficits in attention, working memory and executive functions. Functional studies have also demonstrated correlations between striatal dysfunction and cognitive performance. Striatal hypoperfusion and decreased glucose utilization correlate with executive dysfunction. Hypometabolism also occurs throughout the cerebral cortex and correlates with performance on recognition memory, language and perceptual tests. Measures of presynaptic and postsynaptic dopamine biochemistry have also correlated with measurements of episodic memory, speed of processing and executive functioning. Aided by the results of numerous neuroimaging studies, it is becoming increasingly clear that cognitive deficits in HD involve abnormal connectivity between the basal ganglia and cortical areas. In the future, neuroimaging techniques may shed the most light on the pathophysiology of HD by defining neurodegenerative disease phenotypes as a valuable tool for knowing when patients become "symptomatic," having been in a gene-positive presymptomatic state, and as a biomarker in following the disease, thereby providing a prospect for improved patient care.

Effects of fast head turns on head, trunk and pelvis motions during standing and walking in patients with unilateral vestibular deficit	JOURNAL OF VESTIBULAR RESEARCH-EQUILIBRIUM & ORIENTATION			English	Article						yaw rotation of the head; kinematics; unilateral vestibular deficit; posture; locomotion; human	COORDINATION; STABILIZATION; ORIENTATION; STROKE	Patients with unilateral vestibular deficit (UVD) report difficulties with maintaining balance while executing fast head turns. Our aim was to determine whether head, trunk, and pelvis angular displacements were symmetrical in patients with UVD as they executed voluntary yaw rotation of the head towards or away from the side of the vestibular lesion, during standing and walking. Eight patients who underwent surgical resection of an acoustic neuroma stood with feet together or walked at comfortable pace across a 10-meter walkway. They turned the head as quickly and as fast as possible in the direction indicated by an illuminating arrow (left, right or none). The head angular displacement was similar towards the affected and intact sides. Acceleration tended to be larger during head rotations towards the affected versus the intact side by 13% at the head, 42% at the trunk and 37% at the pelvis (p > 0.05, NS). The pelvis rotated opposite to the head in 65% of trials towards the affected side and 56% of the trials towards the intact side during standing and 81% and 69%, respectively during walking. Overall, the UVD had only a minor influence on the symmetry of head, trunk and pelvis kinematics during fast yaw rotation of the head executed during standing and walking.

The role of spatial phase in texture segmentation and contour integration	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						spatial phase; texture perception; contour integration; log-Gabor function	HUMAN VISUAL-SYSTEM; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROFILES; CATS STRIATE CORTEX; HUMAN-VISION; NATURAL SCENES; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; PSYCHOMETRIC FUNCTION; ASSOCIATION FIELD; CORTICAL-CELLS; DISCRIMINATION	It has been recently argued that the visual system possesses just two phase "detector'' mechanisms, namely, + cosine and -cosine ( P. C. Huang, F. A. Kingdom, & R. F. Hess, 2006). This suggests rather limited access to the rich distribution of receptive field phase that neurophysiologists tell us are represented in the different response profiles of striate simple cells. Whereas that study has suggested that striate receptive field phase is not directly available to perception for the detection/discrimination of localized stimuli, here we investigate whether such information might be used in more integrative striate or extrastriate functions such as texture segregation or contour integration. Specifically, given that simple cells have different local absolute phase response profiles, we ask whether a network of simple cells with similar phase preferences interact in such a way as to extract textures, contours, or both based on phase alone. Two novel texture segmentation experiments and one contour integration experiment were carried out with the intention of providing an answer to the question of how useful is local absolute spatial phase for texture segmentation and contour integration. The results support the possibility of two phase mechanisms (+/-cosine) for global texture segmentation, as well as for contour integration, when the elements that make up a given contour are orthogonal to contour paths.

In the present study, gender-related changes in AGEs and nitric oxide synthase were investigated in Sprague - Dawley (SD) and stroke-prone SHR (SHRsp) rats. Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted on kidneys from 24-week-old male and female SD rats as well as SHRsp. The systolic blood pressure of SHRsp was significantly higher than that of SD rats. Male SD rats had more intense kidney staining for CEL than female SD rats. Both male and female SHRsp had more marked CEL and CML staining localized to kidney tubules, as opposed to SD rats. Female rats showed more staining in glomerular vessels than male rats in both SD and SHRsp. Nuclei containing nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 and activated macrophages were seen in the kidney from SHRsp, not so much in SD rats, localized to renal tubules in male and glomerular vessels in female SHRsp. A higher protein level of NF-kappa B p65 was found in SHRsp than in SD rats. SD rats had more intense kidney neuronal nitric oxide synthase staining than SHRsp. The intensity of inducible nitric oxide synthase staining was significantly higher in SHRsp than in SD rats, with no gender differences in either strain. SHRsp and male rats exhibited higher AGEs and oxidative stress than SD and female rats, respectively. These differences might partly account for the development of hypertension in SHRsp and the higher vulnerability of male animals to renal pathology.

Mortality related to cerebrovascular disease in systemic lupus erythematosus	LUPUS			English	Article						cerebrovascular disease; mortality; systemic lupus erythematosus	SWEDISH POPULATION; SINGLE-CENTER; DEATH	The objective of this study was to examine mortality rates related to cerebrovascular disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared to the general population. Our sample was a multisite Canadian SLE cohort (10 centres, n = 2688 patients). Deaths due to cerebrovascular disease were ascertained by vital statistics registry linkage using ICD diagnostic codes. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR, ratio of deaths observed to expected) estimates were calculated. The total SMR for death due to cerebrovascular disease was 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0, 3.7). When considering specific types I of events, the category with the greatest increased risk was that of ill-defined cerebrovascular events (SMR 44.9, 95% Cl 9.3, 131.3) and other cerebrovascular disease (SMR 8.4, 95% Cl 2.3 21.6). Deaths due to cerebral infarctions appeared to be less common than hemorrhages and other types of cerebrovascular events. Our data suggest an increase in mortality related to cerebrovascular disease in SLE patients compared to the general population. The large increase in ill-defined cerebrovascular events may represent cases of cerebral vasculitis or other rare forms of nervous system disease; alternately, it may reflect diagnostic uncertainty regarding the etiology of some clinical presentations in SLE patients. The suggestion that more deaths are attributed to cerebral hemorrhage. as opposed to infarction, indicates that inherent or iatrogenic factors (eg, thrombocytopenia or anticoagulation) may be important. In view of the paucity of large-scale studies of mortality attributed to neuropsychiatric outcomes in SLE, our findings highlight the need for additional research in large SLE cohorts.

J	Dubrovsky, B				Dubrovsky, B			A paracrine component of salient symptoms of depression in Cushing's of diencephalic origin, and in perimenstrual syndromes: A hypothesis	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article							BRAIN; NEUROSTEROIDS; DISORDERS; PLASMA; CRH	Interrelationships between adrenocortical secretions and depression syndromes have been known since early in the 20th century. Now, the fact that pregnane and pregnene steroids are also known to be synthesized in the brain (they are termed neurosteroids (NS)), raises the possibility that these natural compounds could have paracrine effects. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) can modulate biosynthesis of NSs. 17 beta estradiol has been shown to decrease THP concentration in the brain. It is hypothesized that imbalance between stimulatory and depressant NSs induced by ACTH elevation in hypothalamo pituitary dependent Cushing's, and by estrogen concentration changes during the menstrual cycle, may be associated with the pathophysiology of salient symptoms of depression in Cushing's and in perimenstrual syndromes.

Several methods have been developed for the faithful reconstruction of surface models which describe the true cortical surface in both geometry and topology. However there has been no explicit method for the quantitative evaluation of the whole-cortical-surface models. In this study, we present a novel phantom-based evaluation method of the cortical surface reconstruction algorithm and quantitatively validated the local morphometric accuracy of CLASP which is one of the well-established reconstruction methods. The evaluation included local geometrical accuracy and performance of cortical thickness measure. The validation study revealed that there were some underestimations of cortical thickness measure using CLASP in the ventral and sulcal areas of the cortex and overestimations in the gyral areas and inferior temporal lobe. This study could present a generic metric for the quantitative evaluation of cortical surface reconstruction algorithm.

In contrast with global image representations such as active appearance models, the parts-based model consists of a collection of localized image parts whose appearance, geometry and occurrence frequency are quantified statistically. The parts-based approach explicitly addresses the case where one-to-one correspondence does not exist between subjects due to anatomical differences, as parts are not expected to occur in all subjects. The model can be learned automatically, discovering structures that appear with statistical regularity in a large set of subject images, and can be robustly fit to new images, all in the presence of significant inter-subject variability. As parts are derived from generic scale-invariant features, the framework can be applied in a wide variety of image contexts, in order to study the commonality of anatomical parts or to group subjects according to the parts they share. Experimentation shows that a parts-based model can be learned from a large set of MR brain images, and used to determine parts that are common within the group of subjects. Preliminary results indicate that the model can be used to automatically identify distinctive features for inter-subject image registration despite large changes in appearance.

The data is used as a gold-standard to evaluate four SPECT/MRI similarity-based registration methods. Simulation realism was accounted for using accurate physical models of data generation and acquisition. MRI and SPECT simulations were generated from three subjects to take into account inter-subject anatomical variability. Functional SPECT data were computed from six functional models of brain perfusion. Previous models of normal perfusion and ictal perfusion observed in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE) were considered to generate functional variability. We studied the impact noise and intensity non-uniformity in MRI simulations and SPECT scatter correction may have on registration accuracy. We quantified the amount of registration error caused by anatomical and functional variability. Registration involving ictal data was less accurate than registration involving normal data. MR intensity non-uniformity was the main factor decreasing registration accuracy. The proposed simulated database is promising to evaluate many functional neuroimaging methods, involving MRI and SPECT data.

The desired structure is typically generated via manual tracing within this model. When model-based segmentation is applied to human cortical data, problems arise if left-right comparisons are desired. The asymmetry of the human cortex requires that both left and right models of a structure be composed in order to effectively segment the desired structures. Paradoxically, defining a model in both hemi-spheres carries a likelihood of introducing bias to one of the structures. This paper describes a novel technique for creating a symmetric average model in which both hemispheres are equally represented and thus left-right comparison is possible. This work is an extension of that proposed by Guimond et al [1]. Hippocampal segmentation is used as a test-case in a cohort of 118 normal eld-erly subjects and results are compared with expert manual tracing.

Digital atlases are advantageous since they can be warped nonlinearly to fit each patient's unique anatomy. Functional neurosurgery with implantation of deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrodes requires accurate targeting, and has become a popular surgical technique in Parkinsonian patients. In this paper, we present a method for integrating postoperative data from subthalamic (STN) DBS implantation into an antomical atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus. The method estimates electrode position from post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. These electrodes are then warped back into the atlas space and are modelled in three dimensions. The average of these models is then taken to show the region where the majority of STN DBS electrodes were implanted. The group with more favorable post-operative results was separated from the group which responded to the STN DBS implantation procedure less favourably to create a probablisitic distribution of DBS in the STN electrodes.

This is especially true in the case of dynamic PET studies, in which counting statistics of the volume can vary widely over the time-course of the acquisition. Realistic simulated data-sets which model anatomy and physiology, and make explicit the spatial and temporal image acquisition characteristics, facilitate experimentation with a wide range of the conditions anticipated in practice, and which can severely challenge algorithm performance and reliability. As a first example, we have developed a realistic dynamic FDG-PET data-set using the PET-SORTEO Monte Carlo simulation code and the MNI digital brain phantom. The phantom is a three-dimensional data-set that defines the spatial distribution of different tissues. Time activity curves were calculated using an impulse response function specified by generally accepted rate constants, convolved with an input function obtained by blood sampling, and assigned to grey and white matter tissue regions. We created a dynamic PET study using PET-SORTEO configured to simulate an ECAT Exact HR+. The resulting sinograms were reconstructed with all corrections, using variations of FBP and OSEM. Having constructed the dynamic PET data-sets, we used them to evaluate the performance of intensity-based registration as part of a tool for quantifying hyper/hypo perfusion with particular application to analysis of brain dementia scans, and a study of the stability of kinetic parameter estimation.

It acts as a Rho antagonist by covalently attaching an ADPribose group to RhoA, B, and C proteins. Cell-permeable C3 fusion proteins have been developed so that lower doses of C3 can be used. We describe a simple and fast fluorescence-based assay to evaluate the enzymatic activity of cell-permeable C3 proteins purified from Escherichia coli. The assay measures glycohydrolase (GH) activity of C3 that cleaves NAD+ into ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. Results from the GH activity correlate with other tests carried out in tissue culture cells such as neurite outgrowth or ADP ribosylation of RhoA. This method provides reliable measurements of the activity of permeable C3 proteins or other C3-related proteins.

It is responsible for cases of polyserositis, meningitis and pneumonia in young pigs. To date, 15 serotypes have been described, although several non-typable isolates are frequently recovered from diseased animals. The pathogenesis of H. parasuis infection is poorly understood. To cause meningitis, H. parasuis would have to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC). The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of H. parasuis to interact with porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMEC). It was demonstrated that the serotype 5 reference strain of H. parasuis, Nagasaki (originally recovered from a case of meningitis), was able to adhere at very high levels to and, most importantly, invade PBMEC. These capacities were confirmed by electron microscopy. Actinobacillus pleuropnemoniae serotype 7 (strain WF 83), used as negative control, was not able to adhere to or invade PBMEC. Comparisons of the levels of adhesion and invasion by several H. parasuis field strains from different serotypes isolated from cases of either meningitis or pneumonia showed that isolates of serotypes 4 and 5 had a higher invasion capacity than isolates belonging to other serotypes. Inhibition studies demonstrated that PBMEC invasion by H. parasuis required rearrangement of actin microfilaments and microtubular cytoskeletal elements but not active bacterial DNA, RNA or protein synthesis. Characterization studies demonstrated that proteinaceous invasin(s) does not seem to play a major role in entry of H. parasuis into PBMEC. Intracellular viable H. parasuis were found in PBMEC up to 6 h after antibiotic treatment. Even at high bacterial doses, H. parasuis was not toxic to PBMEC. In swine, the invasion of endothelial cells of the BBB may play an important role in the pathogenesis of meningitis caused by H. parasuis.

To control gene expression of transfected cells in the capsule exogenously, Tet-on system was applied. Under this system, addition of Dox to cells increases the expression of genes. And to obtain the cell line secreting human beta-endorphin, we designed a new gene construction. We fused the sequences of human beta-endorphin to the N-terminal 63 amino acid residues of NLL NLI is a type H membrane protein as a member of the neprilysin family. The stable transfectant (HEK[pTet-NL1-endoJ cells) secreted appreciable amounts of Pendorphin. Since gene expression in the cells can be regulated by the Tet-on system, HEK[pTet-NL1-endo] cells (1.0 x 10(6) cells) which were seeded in 35-mm-diameter dishes, and treated for 24h with Dox at concentrations of 1,000, 100, 50, 20, 10, 1.0 or Ong/ml. HEK[pTet-NL1-endo] secreted P-endorphin in a dose-dependent manner upon Dox addition. In our previous study, we showed a dose-dependent secretion of ACTH from encapsulated Neuro2A-POMC cells implanted in vivo in the CSF of rats, upon administration of Dox to host peritoneum space. Thus it can be envisaged that HEK[pTet-NL1-endo] cells, encapsulated and transplanted in the CSF of host animals, would secrete beta-endorphin according to the various amounts of administered Dox.

We combined traditional methods of enzyme purification with organellar proteomics, isolating lysosomal membranes from mouse liver using differential centrifugation and osmolysis, followed by detergent extraction and purification of N-acetyltransferase by liquid chromatography. Partially purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 240 kDa and pI of 7.4 by gel filtration and chromatofocusing. Its specific activity varied with protein concentration typical of oligomeric enzymes or multienzyme complexes. Incubation of N-acetyltransferase with acetyl[C-14]CoA in the absence of the acceptor of the acetyl group resulted in radioactive labeling of a 120-kDa polypeptide, suggesting that it represents a subunit. containing the enzyme active site. Furthermore, following acetyl[C-14]-labeling, the 120-kDa protein was present in the lysosomal membranes purified from the normal human skin fibroblasts but absent in those from the skin fibroblasts of NIPS IIIC patients.

The nature of voluntary control of motor actions	Motor Control and Learning			English	Proceedings Paper	4th Conference on Progress in Motor Control	2003	Caen, FRANCE				REFERENT CONFIGURATION; MOVEMENTS; HYPOTHESIS; FRAMES	Natural laws express the relationships between certain variables called state variables. Constrained by natural laws these variables cannot be specified directly by the nervous system, as illustrated by the failure of the force control theory that relies on the idea of direct programming of kinematics and muscle torques. Natural laws include parameters, some of which are not conditioned by these laws but define essential characteristics of the system's behavior under the action of these laws. This implies that the neural control of motor actions involves changes in parameters of the system. This strategy allows the nervous system to take advantage of natural laws in producing the desired motor output without actually knowing these laws or imitating them in the form of internal models. A well established form of parametric control-threshold control-is briefly reviewed with a major focus on how it helps to solve several motor problems, in particular, the problem of the relationship between posture and movement and redundancy problems in the control of multiple muscles and joints.

These mutants were compared to their respective controls for regional brain metabolism assessed by histochemical staining of the mitochondrial enzyme, cyrochrome oxidase (CO). The enzymatic activity of Grid2(Lc), Grid2(ho), Rora(sg), and Reln(rl) mutants was altered in cerebellum and cerebellar-related pathways at brainstem, midbrain, and telencephalic levels. The CO activity changes in cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei as well as some cerebellar-related regions were linearly correlated with motor performance in stationary beam and rotorod tasks of Grid2(Lc), Rora(sg), and Reln(rl) mutants. These results indicate that in addition to its relation to neural activity, CO staining can be used as a predictor of motor capacity.

We consider why HFN V&V may be both easier and harder than traditional means, and we conclude with a series of practical V&V guidelines. Validation of HFN systems brings us to a systematic study of value approximation performed during the inference phase.

The fuzzy neural network is of the fuzzy logic reasoning ability and the neural network learning ability. The physics meaning of the fuzzy neural network is clear and intelligible. According to the Sugeno reasoning method and the connecting thought, the fuzzy neural network is designed. For the sliding mode control characteristic, the construction of whole control system is designed by means of combining the fuzzy neural network applied in control and the fuzzy neural network applied in identification. The learning algorithm for neural network is also given. The chattering is efficaciously eliminated, because the control signal may be smoothed by the fuzzy neural network sliding mode controller. And its robustness is stronger than that of the common sliding mode variable structure controller. At the same time, the bounded of system uncertainty and disturbance needn't to be known in designing of the fuzzy neural network sliding mode controller. The stability of system is investigated by constructing Lyapunov function. Theorem of system global stability is summarized.

First, a neural network is achieved to solve the inverse kinematics problem (IKP). After pre-processing steps characterizing the minimum time trajectory and the corresponding torques, a fuzzy-neuro controller is developed to deal with the minimum energy trajectory planning. The basic function of this controller is to select the minimum energy link actuator torques allowing the robot end-effector to move from a starting point S to a target point T. This optimization is performed under actuators and workspace constraints. It starts with a fuzzy clustering of input-output data, uses Tsukamoto fuzzy inference and back-propagation algorithm to train the resulting adaptive neural network. The premises parameters (antecedent membership functions parameters) as well as rule-consequence parameters are then learned and optimized, giving the optimal energy torques. Simulation results are provided to prove the efficiency of the proposal.

Affected individuals have developmental, hematological, neurological, metabolic, ophthalmologic and dermatologic clinical findings(1). Although considered a disease of infancy or childhood, some individuals develop symptoms in adulthood(2). The cblC locus was mapped to chromosome region 1p by linkage analysis(3). We refined the chromosomal interval using homozygosity mapping and haplotype analyses and identified the MMACHC gene. In 204 individuals, 42 different mutations were identified, many consistent with a loss of function of the protein product. One mutation, 271dupA, accounted for 40% of all disease alleles.

This release is controlled by specific and highly sensitive 'osmoreceptors' in the hypothalamus. Indeed, AVP-releasing neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) are directly osmosensitive, and this osmosensitivity is mediated by stretch-inhibited cation channels. However, the molecular nature of these channels remains unknown. Here we show that SON neurons express an N-terminal splice variant of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (Trpv1), also known as the capsaicin receptor, but not full-length Trpv1. Unlike their wild-type counterparts, SON neurons in Trpv1 knockout (Trpv1(-/-)) mice could not generate ruthenium red-sensitive increases in membrane conductance and depolarizing potentials in response to hyperosmotic stimulation. Moreover, Trpv1(-/-) mice showed a pronounced serum hyperosmolality under basal conditions and severely compromised AVP responses to osmotic stimulation in vivo. These results suggest that the Trpv1 gene may encode a central component of the osmoreceptor.

The goal of the present study was to examine the associations between subcortical and periventricular white matter hyperimensities (WMHs), cortical and subcortical atrophy, and cognitive function (episodic memory, word fluency, attention, and perceptual, cognitive, and motor speed). This was done within a European collaborative study, Cardiovascular Determinants of Dementia (CASCADE), in which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on community-dwelling individuals. The study includes 1254 persons from eight European study centers, ranging between 64 and 76 years of age (M 69.4 +/- 3.3; 55% men). When demographics (age, education, and sex), study center, and concurrent brain changes had been adjusted for, periventricular WMHS predicted lower performance in word fluency and the Stroop test (time), and subcortical atrophy predicted lower performance in motor speed and the Stroop test (errors). The findings are consistent with findings from lesion and functional neuroimaging studies. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Early recognition of worsening brain function can prove of vital importance as one can initiate measures aimed to prevent further brain damage. Although continuous EEG monitoring provides adequate spatial and temporal resolution and is able to continuously assess brain function in these critically ill patients, it requires a trained electroencephalographer to interpret the massive amounts of data generated. This limitation impedes the widespread use of EEG in assessing real-time brain function in critically ill patients. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a novel method of automated EEG analysis that segments and extracts EEG features, classifies and groups them according to various patterns, and then presents them in a compressed fashion. This permits real-time viewing of several hours of EEG on a single page. Examples are presented from three patients, two with recurrent seizures and one with diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. These patients illustrate the ability of this novel method to detect important real-time physiological changes in brain function that could enable early interventions aimed to prevent irreversible brain damage.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in a neurocritical care unit at a university teaching hospital. We included 29 patients with moderate and severe TBI requiring vasoactive drugs to maintain adequate arterial blood pressure who received corticosteroid. Infected patients were excluded. Blood cortisol levels were measured before and 30 and 60 minutes after the administration of a high-dose corticotropin stimulation test (HDST). Patients received hydrocortisone replacement therapy (200-300 mg/day) and vasoactive drugs requirements were noted. Intracranial pressure was managed according to a predefined protocol. Results: A total of 14 out of 29 (48%) of patients were classified as responders to hydrocortisone (stopping vasoactive drugs within 3 days of starting hydrocortisone). The Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) was used to assess neurologic outcome at 6 months. A favorable outcome (GOS 4 and 5) was observed in 11 out of 14 (79%) of responders and five out of 15 (33%) of nonresponders (p=0.03). Of the responders, 12 out of 14 (85%) had a baseline cortisol below 414 nmol/L, and five out of 14 (36%) had primary adrenal insufficiency (AI) (primary AI: low baseline cortisol, and poor response to the HDST). Age, severity of injury, and response to hydrocortisone were predictive of outcome in multiple logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Adrenal insufficiency is frequent after TBI, and hydrocortisone replacement therapy seems to be associated with a favorable neurologic outcome.

Factors predicting extubation success in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						extubation; Guillain-Barre syndrome; mechanical ventilation; vital capacity	MECHANICAL VENTILATION; RESPIRATORY-FAILURE	Introduction: Accurate prediction of successful extubation in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an important clinical problem. We hypothesized that reversal of clinical indices used to intubate a patient (i.e., declining vital capacity [VC]) predict extubation. Methods: This was a retrospective study in neurocritical care units at two teaching hospitals identifying all mechanically-ventilated patients with GBS. Results: A total of 44 patients with GBS were included. Of these, 14 patients were successfully extubated. There were 10 failed extubations among six patients; and 20 patients underwent tracheostomy without an extubation trial. On the day of extubation, tower negative inspiratory force (NIF) (-50.3 +/- 12.7 versus -28.6 +/- 16.5 cm H2O, p=0.0005) and higher VC (21.9 +/- 8.4 versus 13.0 +/- 5.9 mL/kg, p=0.003) correlated with successful extubation. Change in VC preintubation to preextubation by greater than 4 mL/kg correlated with 82% sensitivity and 90% positive predictive value for successful extubation. Failed extubations were associated with the presence of pulmonary comorbidities (79 versus 36%, p=0.008) and autonomic dysfunction (73 versus 27%, p=0.008). Length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) was increased in patients who failed extubation and in those patients who underwent tracheostomy (21.5 +/- 11.1 versus 12.5 +/- 8.7, p=0.005). In multivariate analysis, higher VC at extubation was associated with successful extubation (p=0.05). Conclusions: In mechanically-ventilated patients with respiratory failure secondary to GBS, NIF less than -50 cm H2O, and VC improvement preextubation to preintubation by 4 mL/kg were significantly associated with successful extubation. Failed extubation or need for tracheostomy correlated with autonomic dysfunction, pulmonary comorbidities, and prolonged LOS in the ICU. Such parameters may be helpful in identifying patients with GBS likely to succeed extubation versus early referral for tracheostomy.

They may be due to ischemic events and are associated with cognitive and physical impairments. It is not known whether the prevalence of these WML in the general population differs across European countries in a pattern similar to that seen for coronary heart disease. Here we report the prevalence of WML in 1,805 men and women drawn from population-based samples of 65- to 75-year-olds in ten European cohorts. Data were collected using standardized methods as a part of the multicenter study CASCADE (Cardiovascular Determinants of Dementia). Centers were grouped by region: south (Italy, Spain, France), north (Netherlands, UK, Sweden), and central (Austria, Germany, Poland). In this 10-year age stratum, 92% of the sample had some lesions, and the prevalence increased with age. The prevalence of WML was highest in the southern region, even after adjusting for differences in demographic and selected cardiovascular risk factors. Brain aging leading to disabilities will increase in the future. As a means of hypothesis generation and for health planning, further research on the geographic distribution of WML may lead to the identification of new risk factors for these lesions.

There is evidence for structural abnormalities extending beyond the visually identified FCD lesion. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has the potential of detecting both lesions and extra-lesional abnormalities because it performs a whole brain voxel-wise comparison. However, on T1-weighted MRI, FCD lesions are characterized by a wide spectrum of signal hyperintensity that may compromise the results of the segmentation step in VBM. Our purpose was to investigate gray matter (GM) changes in individual FCD patients using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). In addition, we sought to assess the performance of this technique for FCD detection with respect to lesion intensity using an operator designed to emphasize areas of hyperintense T1 signal. We studied 27 patients with known FCD and focal epilepsy and 39 healthy controls. We compared the GM map of each subject (controls and patients) with the average GM map of all controls and obtained a GM z-score map for each individual. The protocol being designed to achieve a maximal specificity, no differences in GM concentration were found in the control group. The z-score maps showed an increase in GM that coincided with the lesion in 21/27 (78%) patients. Five of the six remaining patients whose lesions were not detected by VBM presented with a strong lesion hyperintensity, and a significant part of their lesion was misclassified as white matter. In 16/ 27 (59%) patients, there were additional areas of GM increase distant from the primary lesion. Areas of GM decrease were found in 8/27 (30%) patients. In conclusion, individual voxel-based analysis was able to detect FCD in a majority of patients. Moreover, FCD was often associated with widespread GM changes extending beyond the visible lesion. In its current form, however, individual VBM may be unable to detect lesions characterized by strong signal intensity abnormalities. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

To identify proteins involved in the organization of these domains we took advantage of the high lipid content of compact myelin to separate it cleanly from other neural membranes and then used reverse-phase HPLC coupled to Electro-Spray Double Mass Spectrometry ('MudPIT') to characterize the proteome of this sample. MudPIT allowed its to sidestep the bias of 2D-PAGE against either highly charged or transmembrane proteins. Thus, Of 97 proteins that presented at least two, fully tryptic peptides (a stringent threshold), seven were well known myelin markers, including the mayor CNS myelin proteins: proteolipid protein and myelin basic protein, which are not resolvable by 2D-PAGE. Furthermore, we have confirmed and extended the known compact myelin proteome by 22 proteins and confirmed that CNS and PNS myelinated tracts present Sirtuin 2, a tubulin deacetylase, and Septin 7, a small GTPase that is likely to be involved in membrane and cytoplasm partitioning.

At synapses in the CNS, the physiological and structural relationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly complex. The juxtaposition of astrocytic membranes with presynaptic and postsynaptic elements is important for regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity. Recent investigations demonstrate that the morphology of both neuronal and glial components show rapid, continuous structural remodeling in the hippocampus. These physical modifications are likely to have a significant functional impact upon neurotransmission and indicate that the remodeling of astrocytic morphology might be crucial for the dynamic regulation of the synapse and its microenvironment. In this review, we focus on the structural complexities of astrocyte-synapse interactions in the hippocampus and their implications for understanding synaptic physiology, behavior and disease.

Since scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) have been shown to be sensitive indicators of selective attention, the effects of acutely administered nicotine were examined on ERPs and concomitant behavioural performance measures in an auditory selective attention task. Ten (6 males) overnight smoking-abstinent cigarette smokers received nicotine gum (4 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. In a dichotic listening task [which required participants to attend and detect (target) deviant stimuli in one ear and to ignore similar stimuli in the other ear] which included ERP recordings and assessment of response speed and accuracy measures, nicotine gum failed to alter behavioural performance or amplitudes of ERP components sensitive to selective attention [reflected in the N100 and negative difference (Nd) component] or to pre-attentive detection of acoustic change [reflected in the mismatch negativity (MMN) component]. However, nicotine did influence the speed of these voluntary selective processes, as reflected by shortened latencies of the early Nd component. The findings are discussed in relation to the stimulus filter theory of smoking, and with respect to nicotine's actions on involuntary and controlled aspects of selective attention processes.

Although several studies have contributed to the quantitative and qualitative description of memory impairments in HID, the characterization of episodic memory impairments has varied considerably. Whereas most studies report significant impairments on free recall tests, performance on recognition tests has been considerably more variable, ranging from normal to markedly deficient. This absence of a well-established recognition memory deficit has led some investigators to attribute the memory deficits in HD to a retrieval-based episodic memory impairment. We felt that a quantitative review of the literature was needed to better characterize these episodic memory impairments. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the magnitude of the recognition memory deficit in HD and to examine it in relation to the known deficit in recall. Memory data were provided by 544 symptomatic HD patients, 224 presymptomatic gene-carriers, and 963 control subjects. The overall group comparison between symptomatic patients and controls yielded effect sizes of d = 1.95 for free recall and d = 1.73 for recognition. We split the symptomatic group into two subgroups based on their mental status (mild and moderate/severe dementia) and both showed significant deficits in recall and recognition memory, though recall was more impaired than recognition in the mild dementia subgroup. Only slight memory impairment was observed in the presymptomatic subjects. The results show that deficits in recognition memory must be accounted for in future models of memory impairment in HID.

Here, we investigated whether the deficits after early visual deprivation change during childhood by retesting the contrast sensitivity of seven patients treated for bilateral congenital cataract who had been first tested before 7.5 years of age, and of two patients first tested after 11 years of age. For the younger group, contrast sensitivity at low spatial frequencies improved after 1- and 2-year intervals, while their sensitivity at mid and high spatial frequencies did not change. There was no systematic change in the two older patients. The results indicate that early visual input sets up the neural substrate for later improvement in contrast sensitivity at mid and high spatial frequencies. However, there is sufficient plasticity during middle childhood to allow some recovery at low spatial frequencies. The results shed new light on the role of early visual experience and the nature of developmental plasticity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study used a revised version of a cognitive estimations test (CET) to investigate whether patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were impaired on the CET compared with normal elderly controls (NECs). Neuropsychological tests were administered to determine the relationship between CET performance and other cognitive domains. AD patients displayed impaired CET performance when compared with NECs but MCI patients did not. Negative correlations between tests of working memory (WM) and semantic memory and the CET were found in NECs and AD patients, indicating that these cognitive domains were important for CET performance. Regression analysis suggests that AD patients were unable to maintain semantic information in WM to perform the task. The authors conclude that AD patients display deficits in working memory, semantic memory, and executive function, which are required for adequate CET performance.

Using a retrospective analysis, the current study aimed at identifying the specific indicators related to return to work in adults with both symptomatic MTBI and functional impacts, having completed a specialized intervention program. In terms of outcome, 59.1% of the cohort (n=110) returned to some form of work-related activity by the end of intervention whereas the rest had not. Three of the sixteen variables studied were retained (logistic regression) as providing unique and significant (p < 0.05) contributions to the prediction outcome model, namely age, number of subjective symptoms and the presence of a public insurance provider. There was also an interaction between the presence of a public insurance provider and referral delay. Overall percentage of cases correctly classified by the model was 70%, positive predictive accuracy was 72.9%, whereas negative predictive accuracy was 65%. Our findings suggest that any studies attempting to assess functional outcome need to take account of the multifactorial nature of MTBI, including not only more objective psychological/physiological variables related to the injury, but also subjective complaints and environmental factors.

Chronic morphine administration results in tolerance to delta opioid receptor-mediated antinociception	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mu opioid receptor; deltorphin II; formalin; withdrawal; locomotion	SPINAL-CORD; CROSS-TOLERANCE; KNOCKOUT MICE; RAT; MU; AGONISTS; ANALGESIA; BRAIN; STIMULATION; NOCICEPTION	Delta opiold receptor agonists produce only a moderate degree of antinociception, possibly reflecting the predominantly intracellular location of delta opioid receptor. However, recent studies suggest that short term morphine pretreatment can increase delta opiold receptor-mediated antinociception by promoting the translocation of delta opioid receptor to the cell surface. Even more striking sensitization has been reported after long term morphine pretreatment and withdrawal in locomotor tests. In the present study we therefore examined the effects of longer term morphine pretreatment and withdrawal on delta opioid receptor-mediated antinociception in the formalin test. Male adult rats were pretreated daily with morphine (10 mg/kg s.c.) or saline for 10 days, and were tested acutely with the delta opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala(2), Glu(4)]-deltorphin (intrathecal) at 0, 7 and 14 days of withdrawal. Unexpectedly, chronic morphine pre-exposure resulted in tolerance to [D-Ala(2), Glu(4)]-deltorphin-induced antinociception, and this occurred at 0 and 7 but not 14 days of morphine withdrawal. Morphine challenge at withdrawal day 7 confirmed the presence of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of this drug. Chronic morphine pretreatment also resulted in tolerance to the locomotor stimulant effect of [D-Ala(2), Glu(4)]-deltorphin (given i.c.v.), contrary to a previous report of sensitization. However, consistent with previous reports, short term (2 day) pretreatment with morphine did result in sensitization to [D-Ala(2),Glu(4)] -deltorphin. Subsequent in vitro analysis, using [D-125] [D-Ala(2), Glu(4)]-deltorphin or guanosine 5 (gamma-S-35-thio) triphosphate autoradiography, did not reveal any changes in delta opioid receptor binding or function resulting from chronic morphine pretreatment. In conclusion, chronic morphine pretreatment caused tolerance to delta opioid receptor-mediated behavioral effects with no clear change at the receptor level. (c) 2006 IBRO.

Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with either 70 mg/kg cyclophosphamide diluted in saline, i.p., once every 3 days or saline. After 10 days, all animals were tested for urinary frequency and number of low volume voids, as well as symptoms of spontaneous pain. At the end of 12 days, all animals were perfused with histological fixatives and the urinary bladders processed for immunofluorescence using antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter as markers, respectively, of peptidergic primary afferent fibers and parasympathetic efferent fibers. We show that animals treated with cyclophosphamide had inflamed bladders and displayed high urinary frequency as well as some indicators of spontaneous pain, such as piloerection and a rounded-back posture. Furthermore, they had a significant increase in the density of both parasympathetic and peptidergic sensory fibers in the bladder mucosa and an increase in peptidergic sensory fibers in the detrusor muscle. Based on these results, we suggest that peripheral sprouting of parasympathetic and peptidergic fibers could be a mechanism responsible for sensitization of the bladder, leading to urinary symptoms. Since we observed that the parasympathetic and peptidergic fibers often wrapped around one another and that their varicosities were very close, these two fiber populations may be interacting with each other to lead to and maintain sensitization. Future studies are required to establish the role of this fiber sprouting in bladder symptoms. (c) 2005 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The RNA binding and transport proteins staufen and fragile x mental retardation protein are expressed by rat primary afferent neurons and localize to peripheral and central axons	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						primary afferent neuron; fragile X mental retardation protein; staufen; RNA binding protein; axonal translation; RNA cargo	GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; MESSENGER-RNA; BC1 RNA; CAPSAICIN RECEPTOR; SOMATODENDRITIC DOMAIN; SYMPATHETIC NEURONS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; SENSORY NEURONS; TRANSLATION	Neuronal proteins have been traditionally viewed as being derived solely from the soma; however, accumulating evidence indicates that dendritic and axonal sites are capable of a more autonomous role in terms of new protein synthesis. Such extra-somal translation allows for more rapid, on-demand regulation of neuronal structure and function than would otherwise be possible. While mechanisms of dendritic RNA transport have been elucidated, it remains unclear how RNA is trafficked into the axon for this purpose. Primary afferent neurons of the dorsal root (DRG) and trigeminal (TG) ganglia have among the longest axons in the neuraxis and such axonal protein synthesis would be advantageous, given the greater time involved for protein trafficking to occur via axonal transport. Therefore, we hypothesized that these primary sensory neurons might express proteins involved in RNA transport. Rat DRG and TG neurons expressed staufen (stau) 1 and 2 (detected at the mRNA level) and stau2 and fragile x mental retardation protein (FMRP; detected at the protein level). Stau2 mRNA was also detected in human TG neurons. Stau2 and FMRP protein were localized to the sciatic nerve and dorsal roots by immunohistochemistry and to dorsal roots by Western blot. Stau2 and FMRP immunoreactivities colocalized with transient receptor potential channel type I immunoreactivity in sensory axons of the sciatic nerve and dorsal root, suggesting that these proteins are being transported into the peripheral and central terminals of nociceptive sensory axons. Based on these findings, we propose that stau2 and FMRP proteins are attractive candidates to subserve RNA transport in sensory neurons, linking somal transcriptional events to axonal translation.

We found previously that the daily rhythm of Period2 in these nuclei is uniquely dependent on the integrity of the adrenal glands (Amir S, Lamont EW, Robinson B, Stewart J (2004) A circadian rhythm in the expression of PERIOD2 protein reveals a novel SCN-controlled oscillator in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. J Neurosci 24:781-790; Lamont EW, Robinson B, Stewart J, Amir S (2005) The central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala exhibit opposite diurnal rhythms of expression of the clock protein Period2. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 102:4180-4184). We now show that, in rats, in the absence of the adrenals, corticosterone replacement via the drinking water, which is associated with daily fluctuations in corticosterone levels, restores the rhythm of Period2 in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala. Corticosterone replacement via constant-release pellets has no effect. These results underscore the importance of circadian glucocorticoid signaling in Period2 rhythms in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala and suggest a novel mechanism whereby stressors, drugs of abuse, and other abnormal states that affect the patterns of circulating glucocorticoids can alter the functional output of these nuclei.

In the current study we used a variable load version of the Sternberg item recognition test (two, four, six, or eight letters) and a functional connectivity method based on constrained principal component analysis to extract load-dependent neural systems underlying encoding and maintenance, and to characterize their anatomical overlap and functional interaction. Based on the pattern of functional connectivity, constrained principal component analysis identified a load-dependent encoding system comprising bilateral occipital (Brodmann's area (BA) 17, 18), bilateral superior parietal (BA 7), bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal (BA 46), and dorsal anterior cingulate (BA 24, 32) regions. For maintenance, in contrast, constrained principal component analysis identified a system that was characterized by both load-dependent increases and decreases in activation. The structures in this system jointly activated by maintenance load involved left posterior parietal (BA 40), left inferior prefrontal (BA 44), left premotor and supplementary motor areas (BA 6), and dorsal cingulate regions (BA 24, 32), while the regions displaying maintenance-load-dependent activity decreases involved bilateral occipital (BA 17, 18), posterior cingulate (BA 23) and rostral anterior cingulate/orbitofrontal (BA 10, 11, 32) regions. The correlation between the encoding and maintenance systems was strong and negative (Pearson's r=-.55), indicting that some regions important for visualing maintenance, while subvocal rehearsal and phonological storage regions important for maintenance showed a reduction in activity during encoding. In summary, our analyses suggest that separable and complementary subsystems underlie encoding and maintenance in verbal working memory, and they demonstrate how constrained principal component analysis can be employed to characterize neuronal systems and their functional contributions to higher-level cognition.

Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with either 70 mg/kg cyclophosphamide diluted in saline, i.p., once every 3 days or saline. After 10 days, all animals were tested for urinary frequency and number of low volume voids, as well as symptoms of spontaneous pain. At the end of 12 days, all animals were perfused with histological fixatives and the urinary bladders processed for immunofluorescence using antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter as markers, respectively, of peptidergic primary afferent fibers and parasympathetic efferent fibers. We show that animals treated with cyclophosphamide had inflamed bladders and displayed high urinary frequency as well as some indicators of spontaneous pain, such as piloerection and a rounded-back posture. Furthermore, they had a significant increase in the density of both parasympathetic and peptidergic sensory fibers in the bladder mucosa and an increase in peptidergic sensory fibers in the detrusor muscle. Based on these results, we suggest that peripheral sprouting of parasympathetic and peptidergic fibers could be a mechanism responsible for sensitization of the bladder, leading to urinary symptoms. Since we observed that the parasympathetic and peptidergic fibers often wrapped around one another and that their varicosities were very close, these two fiber populations may be interacting with each other to lead to and maintain sensitization. Future studies are required to establish the role of this fiber sprouting in bladder symptoms. (C) 2005 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cholera toxin injections were made bilaterally into the masseter and, sometimes, digastric muscles to label motoneurons. In the first set of experiments, thick slices were taken from the pontine brainstem and cholera toxin-positive and cholera toxin-negative neurons located inside the trigeminal motor nucleus were filled with biocytin through whole-cell recording patch electrodes. Positively identified motoneurons (cholera toxin+) of various shapes and sizes always had a thick, unbranched axon that entered the motor root following a tight zigzag course. Many cholera toxin-negative neurons were also classified as motoneurons after biocytin filling based on this particularity of their axon. These are probably either fusimotor motoneurons or motoneurons supplying other jaw muscles. The cholera toxin-negative neurons classified as interneurons differed markedly from motoneurons in that they had thin, usually branched axons that supplied the ipsilateral reticular region surrounding the trigeminal motor nucleus (peritrigeminal area), the main trigeminal sensory nucleus, the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus, the medial reticular formation of both sides, and the contralateral medial peritrigerninal area. Most often, their dendrites were arranged in bipolar arbors that extended beyond the borders of the trigeminal motor nucleus into the peritrigerninal area. Immunohistochernistry against glutamate, GABA and glycine was used to further document the nature and distribution of putative interneurons. Immunoreactive neurons were uniformly distributed throughout the rostro-caudal extent of the trigeminal motor nucleus. Their concentration seemed greater toward the edges of the nucleus and they were scarce in the digastric motoneuron pool. Glutamate- outnumbered GABA-and glycine-immunoreactive neurons. There was no clear segregation between the three populations. In the final experiment, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetra-methylindocarbocyanine perchlorate crystals were inserted into one trigeminal motor nucleus in thick slices and allowed to diffuse for several weeks. This procedure marked commissural fibers and interneurons in the contralateral trigeminal motor nucleus. Together these results conclusively support the existence of interneurons in the trigeminal motor nucleus. (c) 2006 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bailey, AL; Ribeiro-da-Silva, A				Bailey, AL; Ribeiro-da-Silva, A			Transient loss of terminals from non-peptidergic nociceptive fibers in the substantia gelatinosa of spinal cord following chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						IB4 binding; synaptic glomeruli; neuropathic pain; CGRP; confocal microscopy; electron microscopy	DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; UNMYELINATED PRIMARY AFFERENTS; GRIFFONIA-SIMPLICIFOLIA-I; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; GROWTH-FACTOR; SENSORY NEURONS; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; THERMAL NOCICEPTION; LECTIN BINDING; DRG NEURONS	It is well known that following peripheral nerve injury, there are numerous changes in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression in the superficial dorsal horn, the dorsal root ganglion and the periphery. Of particular interest are the relative contributions of two sub-types of unmyelinated C-fibers in the initiation and maintenance of chronic pain, the peptidergic, and the non-peptidergic. Evidence gathered in recent years has led researchers to believe that the non-peptidergic nociceptive primary afferents are functionally distinct from their peptidergic counterpart. For our study, we used a well-established animal model of constriction neuropathy (the Kruger model) and studied Wistar rats at 5, 7, 10, 15 and 21 days after nerve lesion caused by the application of a fixed-diameter polyethylene cuff to the left sciatic nerve. Animals were assessed for the onset and evolution of mechanical allodynia using calibrated von Frey filaments and were additionally tested for thermal (heat and cold) hypersensitivity. Immunocytochemical detection of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and isolectin B4 (04) binding was used to visualize the dorsal horn distribution of the boutons from the peptidergic and non-peptidergic fibers respectively. Using confocal microscopy and image analysis, we detected a significant decrease in the density of IB4-labeled boutons, ipsilateral to the lesion, at seven and 10 days following nerve injury. The density of IB4-labeled varicosities retuned to control levels by 15 days. There were no significant changes in the density of CGRP-labeled varicosities at all time points examined. Applying electron microscopy, we initially detected degenerative changes in the central elements of type I glomeruli and then a considerable reduction in their number followed by recovery at 15 days post-lesion. As the central boutons of type la represent varicosities from the fibers which bind IB4, the ultrastructural changes confirmed that there was a bona fide transient loss of varicosities, not simply a loss of IB4 binding. These data indicate that, in this animal model, morphological changes in the nociceptive C-fiber input of the rat dorsal horn are restricted to the non-peptidergic sub-population and are transient in nature. Furthermore, such changes do not correlate with the time-course of the allodynia. (c) 2005 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is not known, however, whether such changes are accompanied by morphological changes in these neurons. We characterized and labeled cells in slices containing the ventral tegmental area using whole-cell electrophysiological methods. Injections of saline or amphetamine were given to rats on postnatal days 10, 12 and 14 and individual neurons were examined one to four weeks later. We show that repeated exposure to amphetamine induces substantial dendritic growth of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons in vivo. Furthermore, we show, by immuno-neutralization of endogenous basic fibroblast growth factor, that the amphetamine-induced increase in astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor in the ventral tegmental area is essential for these morphological changes. We propose that the amphetamine-induced elaboration of the dendritic arbor of dopaminergic neurons leads to their increased excitability and contributes to compulsive drug-seeking and relapse.

Instead of dissecting various frequency bands of the major oscillations that characterize the brain electrical activity during states of vigilance, it is conceptually more rewarding to analyze their coalescence, which is due to neuronal interactions in corticothalamic systems. This concept of unified brain rhythms does not only include low-frequency sleep oscillations but also fast (beta and gamma) activities that are not exclusively confined to brain-activated states, since they also occur during slow-wave sleep. The major factor behind this coalescence is the cortically generated slow oscillation that, through corticocortical and corticothalamic drives, is effective in grouping other brain rhythms. The experimental evidence for unified oscillations derived from simultaneous intracellular recordings of cortical and thalamic neurons in vivo, while recent studies in humans using global methods provided congruent results of grouping different types of slow and fast oscillatory activities. Far from being epiphenomena, spontaneous brain rhythms have an important role in synaptic plasticity. The role of slow-wave sleep oscillation in consolidating memory traces acquired during wakefulness is being explored in both experimental animals and human subjects. Highly synchronized sleep oscillations may develop into seizures that are generated intracortically and lead to inhibition of thalamocortical neurons, via activation of thalamic reticular neurons, which may explain the obliteration of signals from the external world and unconsciousness during some paroxysmal states.

The present paper deals with the contribution of neuropsychology to the characterization of the type of epilepsy and the possible mechanisms underlying idiopathic epileptic syndromes. The non-lesional, so-called idiopathic epilepsies, constitute an interesting model for assessing the relationship between epileptiform EEG discharges and cognition. Among the idiopathic generalized epilepsies, disorders of social integration and personality have been frequently reported in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (ME). Since similar disturbances are observed in frontal-lobe-lesioned patients, impairments in other frontal lobe functions (e.g. executive functions) might be expected in JME. This gives rise to speculation about the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in JME. With regard to partial idiopathic epilepsies, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) may provide a useful model for the study of the relationship between epileptiform EEG discharges in the peri-sylvian region and language functions. Furthermore, the description of mild cognitive dysfunctions in BCECTS, and their persistence into adulthood, can provide information about compensatory mechanisms and may allow for the generation of remedial strategies. Thus, 'lesional' neuropsychology has given way to 'dynamic' neuropsychology based on specific postulates. By using the cognitive profile to specify the mechanism underlying the behavioral disturbances observed in different types of epilepsy, neuropsychology may eventually contribute to a revision of the present classification of epileptic syndromes. In addition, the neuropsychological data may help predict the extent and limits of functional recovery and cerebral plasticity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, a clear Understanding of the types and magnitude of such effects are difficult to discern from such a large and varied collection Of published reports. This review evaluated a total of 40 relevant placebo-controlled Studies published since Rapport and Kelly's [1993. Psychostimulant effects on learning and cognitive function. In: Matson, J.L.. (Ed.), Handbook of Hyperactivity in Children. Allyn & Bacon, Boston, pp. 97-136] Original review of cognitive effects of methylphenidate in children with ADHD. Of these published studies, 63.5% identified some improvement in cognitive function following methylphenidate treatment. Methylphenidate improved performance on saccadic eye movement, planning/cognitive flexibility, attention/vigilance, and inhibitory control tasks in 83.3%, 71.4%, 70.6%, and 69.7% of studies, respectively. A total 58.3% and 50% Of Studies that evaluated the effect of methylphenidate on tasks of memory and working memory/divided attention, respectively, noted improvement. Variability of findings across Studies may be explained by differential effects of methylphenidate on brain function, intra- and inter-individual variability in medication response, methodological limitations, and problems associated with repeated neuropsychological assessment and metric properties of commonly utilised neuropsychological instruments..

The sample consisted of 110 preschoolers, of age 5, from Nunavik. Lead concentration was measured at birth and at testing time. Average lead levels were of 4.9 mu g/dL (0.24 mu mol/L) and 5.3 mu g/dL (0.26 mu mol/L) for cord and child blood, respectively. Children's balance and fine motor capacities were tested. A modified version of the IBR was used to assess behaviour. Postnatal blood lead concentrations correlated positively with both impulsivity and activity. Neither pre- nor postnatal blood lead concentration correlated with attention level. The children's scores on impulsivity (1) and activity (A) were summed to create the independent variable IA, which was tested as a potential mediator between lead exposure and two dependent variables: the coefficient of covariation in alternating hand movements and transversal sway in tandem position. Mediation was significant only for the latter variable. IA and attention were then tested as potential moderators in the relation between postnatal lead exposure and motor function. No significant interaction between independent variables could be observed. These results do not support the hypothesis that, at low levels of postnatal exposure, lead acts indirectly on motor function via behaviour. However, IA does act as a mediator in the relationship between postnatal blood lead concentration and transversal sway in tandem position. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Materials and Methods: Forty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Six animals served as normal controls (without spinal cord transaction (ST)), while 42 rats underwent ST at the 10th thoracic vertebra. Two weeks after ST, cystometrogram (CMG) was performed in six randomly chosen animals to ensure the development of neurogenic detrusor overactivity. The remaining 36 rats were divided into three equal groups, 12 received the vehicle as "paraplegic controls," 12 received WAY-133537 0.3 mg/kg, and 12 received WAY-133537 3 mg/kg. Each "paraplegic control" and treatment group was further divided into two sub-groups (n=6), with CMG at 3 and 4 weeks after ST, respectively. Results: Two weeks after ST, all "vehicle control" rats developed detrusor overactivity with a mean frequency of 0.96 and 1.48 contractions/min and amplitude of 22.96 and 31.22 cm H2O with 1- and 2-week treatment, respectively. Neurogenic detrusor overactivity disappeared from 50% of rats that received WAY-133537 0.3 mg/kg for 1 week, and frequency decreased to 0.41 contractions/min. After 2 weeks of treatment, detrusor overactivity vanished from 67% of the animals with even further reduction in the frequency of detrusor overactivity (0.22 contractions/min, P < 0.01). in rats that received 3 mg/kg of the drug for 1 week, detrusor overactivity disappeared from only one animal with a non-significant decline in frequency. Fifty percent of rats given WAY-133537 at the dose of 3 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks manifested no detrusor overactivity. Conclusions: WAY-133537 shows efficacy in increasing bladder capacity and reducing the frequency of spontaneous bladder contractions after ST in rats without decreasing voiding pressure.

Psychophysical testing revealed that the best predictor of pain exacerbation was odor unpleasantness. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed increased activation following an unpleasant odor in pain related areas, including the thalamus, amygdala, insular and anterior cingulate cortices, with similar trends in primary somatosensory cortex hand/arm area. The increased pain and associated neural activations in response to unpleasant odors may be related to the phenomenon of synesthesia, to a rewiring of olfactory pathways onto pain pathways mimicking synesthesia or, to activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

Cannabis products have historically been used for chronic pain and are attracting renewed pharmaceutical interest. Nabilone is a synthetic cannabinoid licensed in Canada for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. We have used nabilone off-label for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain since 1999. In this article, we review our clinical experience of 20 adult patients with chronic noncancer pain who had been treated with nabilone and followed up for an average of 1.5 years. Prior to nabilone therapy, patients had used a wide range of therapies, including 11 who had used cannabis. Fifteen patients reported subjective overall improvement with nabilone, and nine reported reduced pain intensity. Beneficial effects on sleep and nausea were the main reasons for continuing use. Intolerable side effects were experienced in three patients (palpitations, urinary retention, dry mouth). Nabilone may be a useful addition to pain management and should be further evaluated in randomized controlled trials.

The growing shift toward home care services assumes that "being home is good" and that this is the most desirable option. Although ethical issues in medical decision-making have been examined in numerous contexts, home care decisions for technology-dependent children and the moral dilemmas that this population confronts remain virtually unknown. This study explored the moral dimension of family experience through detailed accounts of life with a child who requires assisted ventilation at home. This study involved an examination of moral phenomena inherent in (1) the individual experiences of the ventilator-assisted child, siblings, and parents and (2) everyday family life as a whole. METHODS. A qualitative method based on Richard Zaner's interpretive framework was selected for this study. The population of interest for this study was the families of children who are supported by a ventilator or a positive-pressure device at home. Twelve families (38 family members) were recruited through the Quebec Program for Home Ventilatory Assistance. Children in the study population fell into 4 diagnostic groups: (1) abnormal ventilatory control (eg, central hypoventilation syndrome), (2) neuromuscular disorders, (3) spina bifida, and (4) craniofacial or airway abnormalities resulting in upper airway obstruction. All 4 of these diagnostic groups were included in this study. Among the 12 children recruited, 4 received ventilation via tracheostomies, and 8 received ventilation with face masks. All of the latter received ventilation only at night, except for 1 child, who received ventilation 24 hours a day. Family moral experiences were investigated using semistructured interviews and fieldwork observations conducted in the families' homes. RESULTS. Data analysis identified 6 principal themes. The themes raised by families whose children received ventilation invasively via a tracheostomy were not systematically different or more distressed than were families of children with face masks. The principal themes were (1) confronting parental responsibility: parental responsibility was described as stressful and sometimes overwhelming. Parents needed to devote extraordinary care and attention to their children's needs. They struggled with the significant emotional strain, physical and psychological dependence of the child, impact on family relationships, living with the daily threat of death, and feeling that there was "no free choice" in the matter: they could not have chosen to let their child die. (2) Seeking normality: all of the families devoted significant efforts toward normalizing their experiences. They created common routines so that their lives could resemble those of "normal" families. These efforts seemed motivated by a fundamental striving for a stable family and home life. This "striving for stability" was sometimes undermined by limitations in family finances, family cohesion, and unpredictability of the child's condition. (3) Conflicting social values: families were offended by the reactions that they faced in their everyday community. They believe that the child's life is devalued, frequently referred to as a life not worth maintaining. They felt like strangers in their own communities, sometimes needing to seclude themselves within their homes. (4) Living in isolation: families reported a deep sense of isolation. In light of the complex medical needs of these children, neither the extended families nor the medical system could support the families' respite needs. (5) What about the voice of the child? The children in this study (patients and siblings) were generally silent when asked to talk about their experience. Some children described their ventilators as good things. They helped them breathe and feel better. Some siblings expressed resentment toward the increased attention that their ventilated sibling was receiving. ( 6) Questioning the moral order: most families questioned the "moral order" of their lives. They contemplated how "good things" and "bad things" are determined in their world. Parents described their life as a very unfair situation, yet there was nothing that they could do about it. Finally, an overarching phenomenon that best characterizes these families' experiences was identified: daily living with distress and enrichment. Virtually every aspect of the lives of these families was highly complicated and frequently overwhelming. An immediate interpretation of these findings is that families should be fully informed of the demands and hardships that would await them, encouraging parents perhaps to decide otherwise. This would be but a partial reading of the findings, because despite the enormous difficulties described by these families, they also reported deep enrichments and rewarding experiences that they could not imagine living without. Life with a child who requires assisted ventilation at home involves living every day with a complex tension between the distresses and enrichments that arise out of this experience. The conundrum inherent in this situation is that there are no simple means for reconciling this tension. This irreconcilability is particularly stressful for these families. Having their child permanently institutionalized or "disconnected" from ventilation (and life) would eliminate both the distresses and the enrichments. These options are outside the realm of what these families could live with, aside from the 1 family whose child is now permanently hospitalized, at a tremendous cost of guilt to the family. CONCLUSIONS. These findings make important contributions by (1) advancing our understanding of the moral experiences of this group of families; (2) speaking to the larger context of other technology-dependent children who require home care; (3) relating home care experiences to neonatal, critical care, and other hospital services, suggesting that these settings examine their approaches to this population that may impose preventable burdens on the lives of these children and their families; and (4) examining a moral problem with an empirical method. Such problems are typically investigated through conceptual analyses, without directly examining lived experience. These findings advance our thinking about how we ought to care for these children, through a better understanding of what it is like to care for them and the corresponding major distresses and rewarding enrichments. These findings call for an increased sensitization to the needs of this population among staff in critical care, acute, and community settings. Integrated community support services are required to help counter the significant distress endured by these families. Additional research is required to examine the experience of other families who have decided either not to bring home their child who requires ventilation or withdraw ventilation and let the child die.

J	Lachaine, J				Lachaine, Jean			Therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting - A pharmacoeconomic review	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Review							PROPHYLACTIC ANTIEMETIC THERAPY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; ONDANSETRON; EFFICACY; SURGERY; DOLASETRON; DROPERIDOL; ANESTHESIA; EMESIS	Even with the development of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in recent years, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remains a significant concern for clinicians and patients. For the selection of an appropriate antiemetic strategy for PONV, economic considerations should be taken into account. A literature search covering the period from September 1996 to August 2005 yielded 16 economic evaluations on antiemetics used for the prevention or treatment of PONV. In these studies, a variety of different antiemetic regimens were evaluated, with different doses and timing of administration, in many different populations, for various types of surgery, and in different settings. In addition, there were many differences in the design of these economic evaluations in terms of the extent of the costs considered and the decision rules used when forming conclusions. Therefore, despite the availability of economic evaluations on antiemetics in PONV, it is difficult to draw clear conclusions with such disparate information. In spite of these limitations, key learning can be drawn from these economic evaluations. From studies where a placebo was used as a comparator, we can conclude that there is clinical benefit in using an antiemetic for the prevention of PONV versus no therapy. The dose of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist seems more important in determining cost effectiveness than the selection of the agent itself, and less expensive agents such as droperidol, dexamethasone and prochlorperazine may also represent cost-effective alternatives to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. In an additional six studies where a willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid or reduce the incidence of PONV was estimated, the average WTP amounts varied from $US29 to $US117. Many questions remain unanswered about the cost effectiveness of existing antiemetics and their regimens, and little is known about the impact of new agents, such as the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, in the control of PONV.

Quantitative (Q)-PCR experiments indicated that SgII, PC1, and PC2 mRNAs were overexpressed in pheochromocytoma compared to non-tumoral chromaffin cells (P < 0.001) and in benign compared to malignant tumors (P < 0.01). Western blot analysis using a human SgII antiserum revealed the occurrence of a 97-kDa band corresponding to the expected size of SgII, with significantly higher quantities in benign than in malignant tumors (P < 0.05). Using antisera directed against sequential regions of SgII (N-terminal, secretoneurin [SN], EM66, internal, and C-terminal sequences), we observed distinct processing profiles between benign and malignant pheochromocytomas. In contrast, using PC1 and PC2 antisera no differences between the two types of tumors were found. RIA measurement showed that EM66 median values between benign and malignant chromaffin cell tumors were significantly different 128.5 vs. 6.3 ng/mg protein, respectively; P < 0.001). Taken together, these results indicate that, in pheochromocytoma, malignancy is associated with reduced PC1, PC2, and SgII mRNA expression and decreased levels of processing products of SgII, in line with the low concentrations of EM66 that occur in malignant tumors. These data support the notion that SgII-processing products, such as EM66, could represent prognostic markers of pheochromocytomas.

The central program relies fundamentally on a genetically determined spinal circuitry ( central pattern generator) capable of generating the basic locomotor pattern and on various descending pathways that can trigger, stop, and steer locomotion. The feedback originates from muscles and skin afferents as well as from special senses ( vision, audition, vestibular) and dynamically adapts the locomotor pattern to the requirements of the environment. The dynamic interactions are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust the timing and amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the opposite phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. Similarly, stimulation of descending pathways may affect the locomotor pattern in only certain phases of the step cycle. Section II reviews dynamic sensorimotor interactions mainly through spinal pathways. Section III describes how similar sensory inputs from the spinal or supraspinal levels can modify locomotion through descending pathways. The sensorimotor interactions occur obviously at several levels of the nervous system. Section IV summarizes presynaptic, interneuronal, and motoneuronal mechanisms that are common at these various levels. Together these mechanisms contribute to the continuous dynamic adjustment of sensorimotor interactions, ensuring that the central program and feedback mechanisms are congruous during locomotion.

In particular, the advent of molecular genetics and the cloning of pituitary hormone coding genes followed by discovery of their regulators during the last 20 years has provided tremendous insight into the pathophysiological bases of hormone deficit and excess, as well as offering novel therapeutic opportunities. Most insight was gained through the identification of transcription factors that control the program of pituitary organogenesis and cell differentiation; it is indeed the normal developmental program controlled by these transcriptional regulators that is perturbed in inherited forms of hormone deficiency. This review will summarize our current understanding of these processes and their implications for hormone deficiency and hormone resistance syndromes from a developmental perspective.

Dynamic neural network-based fault diagnosis for attitude control subsystem of a satellite	PRICAI 2006: TRENDS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2006)	AUG 07-11, 2006	Guilin, PEOPLES R CHINA					The objective of this paper is to develop a dynamic neural network scheme for fault detection and isolation (FDI) in the reaction wheels of a satellite. ne goal is to decide whether a bus voltage fault, a current loss fault or 4 temperature fault has occurred in one of the three reaction wheels and further to localize which wheel is faulty. In order to achieve these objectives, three dynamic neural networks are introduced to model the dynamics of the wheels on all three axes independently. Due to the dynamic property of the wheel, the architecture utilized is the Elman recurrent network with backpropagation learning algorithm. The effectiveness of this neural network-based FDI scheme is investigated and a comparative study is conducted with the performance of a generalized observer-based scheme. The simulation results have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed neural network-based method.

Creating a neuro-patient resource centre	Proceedings of the 10th International Child Neurology Congress			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Child Neurology Congress	JUN 11-16, 2006	Montreal, CANADA				WEB SITES; INFORMATION; HOSPITALS; INTERNET	A neuro-patient resource centre works with patients and families to connect them with the information and resources they need to understand and cope with neurological disorders. The also centre works with healthcare staff to create patient education material that is evidence-based and appropriate, in reading level and design to the specific patient and family populations. Steps needed to establishing a resource centre include a needs assessment, identifying sources of funding, deciding how best to staff it, developing a budget, forming partnerships with other information providers presently available in the institution and the community, establishing an advisory committee, determining how the Centre will fit into the organization.

One solution is to use a nonlinear filter such as the median. However, median filters modify both noisy and noise free data and they are therefore difficult to use in real time applications. To overcome these limits, a simplified pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) is proposed to correctly detect and remove noisy data while leaving uncorrupted data untouched. Results indicated that a filter based on a PCNN achieved a much better performance than the median filter in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and in visual inspection.

A local joint controller is proposed for each joint, using only local angular position and velocity measurements. These very simple local joint controllers allow trajectory tracking, with reduced computations. The applicability of the proposed scheme is illustrated, via simulations, first by the applications to a two degree of freedom robotic manipulator and then to a seven degree of freedom one.

Bootstrap inference with neural-network modeling for gene-disease association testing	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2006 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology	SEP 28-29, 2006	Toronto, CANADA				SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; PREDICTION; REGRESSION	Estimates derived from neural network modeling are used to test the significance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the categorization of case control status in genetic association studies. Our artificial neural network (ANN) model of gene-disease correlation is represented by a fully connected 3-layered feedforward neural network with input nodes, corresponding to the number of studied SNPs, a hidden layer and a single output unit for the disease status. We used an evaluation procedure that measures the predictive significance of a single SNP, based on the change in the error function when the input is removed from the network. Two ANNs, one with all inputs and the other with a tested input removed are run in parallel and the change in error is calculated as a function of the relative out-of-sample performance of these two-networks. With the help of a bootstrap technique (resampling with replacement) the valid inference of the tested input variables is derived. We report on the performance of the procedure as evaluated on simulated SNP datasets of varying complexity, on a real study dataset and in comparison to an SMV implementation of the procedure.

Comparisons of static and constructive network simulations of the same developmental phenomena bring this issue into clear focus. Constructive algorithms are found to be better at learning and at covering developmental stages and stage sequences. The relatively new sibling-descendant cascade-correlation algorithm (SDCC) decides whether to install each newly recruited hidden unit on the current highest layer or on a new layer. SDCC is applied to the problem of conservation acquisition in children. Results show no differences in comparison to previous conservation simulations done with standard cascade-correlation except for fewer network layers and connections with SDCC.

Prenatal stress and/or glucocorticoid excess might underlie this link. In animal models, prenatal stress, glucocorticoid exposure or inhibition/knockout of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 beta-HSD-2), the feto-placental barrier to maternal glucocorticoids, reduces birth weight and causes permanent hypertension, hyperglycemia, increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and behavior resembling of anxiety. In humans, 11 beta-HSD-2 gene mutations cause low birth weight and placental 11 beta-HSD-2 activity correlates directly with birth weight and inversely with infant blood pressure. Low birth weight babies have higher plasma cortisol levels throughout adult life, indicating HPA programming. In human pregnancy, severe maternal stress affects the offspring HPA axis and associates with neuropsychiatric disorders. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to be a variable in the effects. Intriguingly, some of these effects appear to be 'inherited' into a further. generation, itself unexposed to exogenous glucocorticoids at any point in the lifespan from fertilization, implying epigenetic marks persist into subsequent generation(s). Overall, the data suggest that prenatal exposure to excess glucocorticoids programs peripheral and CNS functions in adult life, predisposing to some pathologies, perhaps protecting from others, and these may be transmitted perhaps to one or two subsequent generations.

Evidence is drawn from research on single forms, form and texture arrays and visual displays. Form complexity and form probability are shown to be linked through their reciprocal relationship in complexity theory, which is in turn shown to be consistent with recent developments in perceptual learning and neural circuit theory.

The sudden loss or disruption of descending input engenders substantial changes at the level of primary afferents, interneurons, and motoneurons thus dramatically influencing sensorimotor interactions in the spinal cord. As a general rule reflexes are initially depressed following spinal cord injury due to severe reductions in motoneuron excitability but recover and in some instances become exaggerated. It is thought that modified inhibitory connections and/or altered transmission in some of these reflex pathways after spinal injury as well as the recovery and enhancement of membrane properties in motoneurons underlie several symptoms such as spasticity and may explain some characteristics of spinal locomotion observed in spinally transected animals. Indeed, after partial or complete spinal lesions at the last thoracic vertebra cats recover locomotion when the hindlimbs are placed on a treadmill. Although some deficits in spinal locomotion are related to lesion of specific descending motor pathways, other characteristics can also be explained by changes in the excitability of reflex pathways mentioned above. Consequently it may be the case that to reestablish a stable walking pattern that modified afferent inflow to the spinal cord incurred after injury must be normalized to enable a more normal re-expression of locomotor rhythm generating networks. Indeed, recent evidence demonstrates that step training, which has extensively been shown to facilitate and ameliorate locomotor recovery in spinal animals, directly influences transmission in simple reflex pathways after complete spinal lesions.

The L5-pelvis junction of a low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis patient was modeled using a personalized finite element model to investigate the biomechanical behavior of the L5-S1 motion segment. Stress distribution and facet contact pressure in the altered segment were analyzed under 500 N simulating the gravitational load. High von Mises stresses were located in the pars interarticularis, in the pedicle, and in the outer region of the annulus. A high contact pressure was obtained at the facet surfaces. Influenced by the pelvic morphology, the inclination of L5-S1 junction affects the resulting shear forces and may play a crucial role in spondylolisthesis development.

However, studies have yielded varied and contradictory results. The goal of the present study was to evaluate HSD over different electroencephalographic derivations during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep of somnambulistic patients and controls during normal sleep and following 38 hours of sleep deprivation, as well as prior to sleepwalking episodes. Design: N/A. Setting: Sleep disorders clinic. Patients: Ten adult sleepwalkers and 10 sex- and age-matched control subjects were investigated polysomnographically during a baseline night and following 38 hours of sleep deprivation. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: During normal sleep, sleepwalkers had a significantly higher ratio of HSD over the time spent in stage 2, 3 and 4 on frontal and central derivations when compared with controls. Sleep deprivation resulted in a significant increase in the ratio of the time in HSD over the time in stage 4 on the frontal lead in both groups and on the central lead in controls. There was no evidence for a temporal accumulation of HSD prior to the episodes. Conclusions: HSD shows a clear frontocentral gradient across all subjects during both baseline and recovery sleep and has relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of NREM parasomnias. Increases in HSD after sleep deprivation may reflect an enhancement of the homeostatic process underlying sleep regulation.

Furthermore, texture discrimination often improves as the disparate texture is moved into the periphery; this has been referred to as the central performance drop (CPD). The interaction of these interesting and counter-intuitive aspects of texture discrimination has received very little attention. Using four stimulus pattern pairs that were previously shown to elicit asymmetrical texture discrimination, we examined texture discrimination asymmetries as a function of eccentricity. We found three patterns of results; (i) both texture arrangements (A in B, and B in A) elicit a CPD but do not show an asymmetry, (ii) both texture arrangements elicit a monotonic decrease in performance with eccentricity (i.e. no CPD) but an asymmetry is seen at each eccentricity and (iii) discrimination asymmetries are minimal at fixation and in the far periphery and maximal about 3 degrees from fixation with a CPD generally shown for the 'stronger' member of the pair. These results emphasize that one cannot talk about the 'discriminability' of a particular texture pair without reference to the arrangement of the two textures and the eccentricity of presentation.

We describe recent clinical studies that compared how well listeners with and without focal right hemisphere damage (RHD) understand speaker attitudes such as "confidence" or "politeness," which are signaled in large part by prosodic features of an utterance. We found that RHD listeners as a group were abnormally sensitive to both the expressed confidence and expressed politeness of speakers, and that these difficulties often correlated with impairments for understanding basic emotions from prosody in many RHD individuals. Our data emphasize a central role for the right hemisphere in the ability to appreciate emotions and speaker attitudes from prosody, although the precise source of these social-pragmatic deficits may arise in different ways in the context of right hemisphere compromise.

Up to now, corticotropin-releasing factor of bullfrog origin has been shown to have a potent TSH-releasing activity, whereas gonadotropin-releasing hormone and TSH-releasing hormone exhibit a moderate TSH-releasing effect on the adult, but not larval, pituitary. In the present study, the effects of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and somatostatin (SS) on the in vitro release of TSH from the bullfrog pituitary were investigated. Both frog (R. ridibunda) PACAP-38 and PACAP-27 caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of the release of TSH from dispersed pituitary cells during a 24-h culture. The PACAP-38- and PACAP-27-induced TSH release was suppressed by a simultaneous application of PACAP6-38. Application of high concentrations of PACAP6-38 alone caused a slight but significant stimulatory effect on the release of TSH. Frog VIP also stimulated TSH release from pituitary cells concentration-dependently. Frog SS1 (homologous to mammalian somatostatin-14) and SS2 (homologous to mammalian cortistatin) did not affect the basal release of TSH but caused a concentration-dependent suppression of the PACAP-38-induced release of TSH. These results suggest the involvement of multiple neuropeptides in the regulation of the release of TSH from the amphibian pituitary.

Stimuli were spatiotemporal Gaussian patches of 2D orientation noise band-pass filtered in Fourier domain. Orientation acuity was measured for various combinations of stimulus spatial bandwidth, spatial frequency, and size as a function of orientation bandwidths of the stimuli. Stimulus contrast was matched in multiples of detection threshold. Consistent with the idea that stimulus orientation bandwidth acts as a source of external noise, orientation discrimination thresholds increased monotonically in all conditions with stimulus bandwidth. To interpret these results quantitatively, we first fitted a variance summation model to the data and derived the internal orientation noise, relative sampling efficiency, and orientation tuning of the mechanism underlying orientation discrimination. Due to the equivocal biological nature of these parameters for orientation discrimination, we investigated, with a modeling approach, how neural detectors characterized by a broad orientation tuning may support orientation discrimination. We demonstrated using the ideal-observer theory that while linear models, based on either unimodal filtering or center-surround opponency, predict the monotonic relationship between orientation discrimination threshold and orientation noise, a nonlinear model incorporating a broadband divisive inhibition in the orientation domain is a better candidate due to its contrast invariance. This model, using broad and similar orientation tuning for its excitatory and inhibitory inputs, accounts for the acute orientation acuity of human vision and proves to be robust despite the variance found in natural stimuli.

For this purpose CFD and NN tools have been developed using an object-oriented approach and C++ programming language. The CFD tool consists of solving the Reynolds time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and k-epsilon turbulence model using body-fitted nearly-orthogonal coordinate system. Subsequently, design wind load parameters Such as speed-tip ratio values have been generated for a wide spectrum of two-dimensional hill geometries that includes isolated and multiple steep and shallow hills. Ground roughness effect has also been considered. Such CFD solutions, however, normally require among other things ample computational time, background knowledge and high-capacity hardware. To assist the end-user, an easier, faster and more inexpensive NN model trained with the CFD-generated data is proposed in this paper. Prior to using the CFD data for training Purposes, extensive validation work has been carried out by comparing with boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) data. The CFD trained NN (CFDNN) has produced speed-up ratio values for cases such as multiple hills that are not covered by wind design standards such as the Commentaries of the National Building Code of Canada (1995). The CFDNN results compare well with BLWT data available in literature and the proposed approach requires fewer resources compared to running BLWT experiments.

J	Borck, C				Borck, Cornelius			Can learning be learnt from the brain? Scientific-historic notes on the appeal of modern brain research	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ERZIEHUNGSWISSENSCHAFT			German	Article						brain research; free will; history of science; neuroscience/society		The progress of the neurosciences and the fascination, with which brain research is currently regarded, leads to the question of whether pedagogy should adopt this discipline's promising models and strategies. From a historical point of view, it is, however, astounding to note how - besides unquestionable successes - neurological research has been persistently focused on the same research questions. For over one hundred years brain research has claimed to be on the verge of a break-through concerning such dominant questions as the character of consciousness or free will. The current dominance of brain research highlights, therefore, concurrently cultural and social re-orientations, which reach far beyond scientific theories. In the interim most of the findings relevant for pedagogy are indeed shared between the disciplines anyway. If brain research takes a final breakthrough such as the decoding of the human genome as its model, the question must instead be raised as to whether central characteristics of our culture are being flippantly cast aside in the process. Above all, this vision ignores the dynamic of the discipline of brain research itself.

In addition, ABCA1 has been reported to modulate beta-amyloid (A beta) production in vitro. These observations raise the possibility that ABCA1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Here we report that the deficiency of ABCA1 does not affect soluble or guanidine-extractable A beta levels in Tg-SwDI/B or amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice, but rather is associated with a dramatic reduction in soluble apoE levels in brain. Although this reduction in apoE was expected to reduce the amyloid burden in vivo, we observed that the parenchymal and vascular amyloid load was increased in Tg-SwDI/B animals and was not diminished in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the proportion of apoE retained in the insoluble fraction, particularly in the APP/PS1 model. These data suggested that ABCA1-mediated effects on apoE levels and lipidation influenced amyloidogenesis in vivo.

Geomorphological parameters describing the land surface drainage characteristics and surface water flow behaviour were empirically associated with measured rainfall and runoff data and used as input to a three-layered back-propagation feed-forward neural network model. Morphological parameters such as bifurcation ratio, area ratio, channel length ratio, drainage factor and relief ratio were selected using the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines tool, based on their relative importance in prediction of runoff and sediment yield. Regression models were developed using the curve-fitting toolbox of MATLAB software and compared with the results obtained from ANN models. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and model efficiency factor (E) were estimated to ascertain the model performance. Geomorphology-based ANN model validation statistics resulted in R-2 values ranging from 0.85 to 0.95 and E values from 0.74 to 0.82 for peak runoff rate and R-2 values from 0.78 to 0.93 and E values from 0.71 to 0.76 for sediment loss. Using geomorphology-based regression models, R-2 values for the same dataset varied from 0.78 to 0.88 (0.74 > E > 0.69) for peak runoff rate prediction and 0.39 to 0.54 (0.53 > E > 0.46) for sediment prediction. When morphological parameters were not associated with rainfall depth and peak runoff rate, prediction error statistical parameter values (R-2 and E) were less for both neural network and regression models. Thus, associating selected geomorphological parameters with rainfall depth and peak runoff rate enhances the accuracy of runoff rate and sediment loss predictions from the watershed. Furthermore, ANN models performed better than the regression equations.

We show here that motor axon growth and guidance are impaired in the absence of Sema3A-Npn-1 signaling. Motor axons enter the limb precociously, showing that Sema3A controls the timing of motor axon in-growth to the limb. Lateral motor column (LMC) motor axons within spinal nerves are defasciculated as they grow toward the limb and converge in the plexus region. Medial and lateral LMC motor axons show dorso-ventral guidance defects in the forelimb. In contrast, Sema3F-Npn-2 signaling guides the axons of a medial subset of LMC neurons to the ventral limb, but plays no major role in regulating their fasciculation. Thus, Sema3A-Npn-1 and Sema3F-Npn-2 signaling control distinct steps of motor axon growth and guidance during the formation of spinal motor connections.

The active constituent of cannabis, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, acts by binding to brain CB, cannabinoid receptors, but an alternative approach might be to develop agents that amplify the actions of endogenous cannabinoids by blocking their deactivation. Here, we show that URB597, a selective inhibitor of the enzyme fatty-acid amide hydrolase, which catalyzes the intracellular hydrolysis of the endocannabinoid anandamide, exerts potent antidepressant-like effects in the mouse tail-suspension test and the rat forced-swim test. Moreover, URB597 increases firing activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus and noradrenergic neurons in the nucleus locus ceruleus. These actions are prevented by the CB, antagonist rimonabant, are accompanied by increased brain anandamide levels, and are maintained upon repeated URB597 administration. Unlike direct CB, agonists, URB597 does not exert rewarding effects in the conditioned place preference test or produce generalization to the discriminative effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol in rats. The findings support a role for anandamide in mood regulation and point to fatty-acid amide hydrolase as a previously uncharacterized target for antidepressant drugs.

The precentral sulcus is composed of two distinct sulcal configurations: 1) the inferior precentral sulcus (IP), situated caudal to the inferior frontal sulcus, and 2) the superior precentral sulcus (SP), caudal to the superior frontal sulcus. The SP was usually a single connected structure, and only in 24% of cases studied did it consist of two separate folds. The caudal end of the superior frontal sulcus and the SP merge on the surface of the brain. However, a clear separation can be established in 72% of cases by analyzing the morphology of the depth of this region in serial sections. Two or three small sulci can be identified in the area between the SP and the midline: the medial precentral. sulcus, the marginal precentral sulcus, and a paramidline sulcus. The IP is composed of three different parts: a dorsal and a ventral branch, both oriented vertically, and a short horizontal extension. The ventral branch forms the caudal border of the inferior frontal gyrus, the dorsal branch forms the caudal border of the ventral portion of the middle frontal gyrus, and the horizontal extension runs in a rostrodorsal direction into the middle frontal gyrus. These three structures are closely related to each other but can, in most cases, be separated in the depth of the inferior precentral sulcal complex.

Receptors tuned to ultrasonic frequencies (similar to those produced by echolocating, insectivorous bats), to a mid-range of frequencies, and a subset of those tuned to low, cricket-like frequencies have similar projections, terminating medially within the auditory neuropile. Quantitative analysis shows that despite the general similarity of these projections they are tonotopic, with receptors tuned to lower frequencies terminating more medially. Another subset of cricket-song-tuned receptors projects more laterally and posteriorly than the other types. Double-fills of receptors and identified interneurons show that the three medially projecting receptor types are anatomically well positioned to provide monosynaptic input to interneurons that relay auditory information to the brain and to interneurons that modify this ascending information. The more laterally and posteriorly branching receptor type may not interact directly with this ascending pathway, but is well positioned to provide direct input to an interneuron that carries auditory information to more posterior ganglia. These results suggest that information about cricket song is segregated into functionally different pathways as early as the level of receptor neurons. Ultrasound-tuned and mid-frequency tuned receptors have approximately twice as many varicosities, which are sites of transmitter release, per receptor as either anatomical type of cricket-song-tuned receptor. This may compensate in part for the numerical underrepresentation of these receptor types.

Good accordance with experimental results has been achieved. It was found that the van der Waals repulsion makes the dominant contribution to the binding energy. GTS-21 and its metabolites are apparently too large for the binding sites of the alpha 7 dimer. To improve the effectiveness of the drug, a possible approach is to reduce its volume while maintaining the presence of the active groups. Our studies, in combination with experimental studies, will lead to a promising basis for practical drug design against Alzheimer's disease. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we show that nodal membranes isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) of mammals restricted neurite outgrowth of cultured neurons.. Proteomic analysis of these membranes revealed several inhibitors of neurite outgrowth, including the oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp). In rat spinal cord, OMgp was not localized to compact myelin, as previously thought, but to oligodendroglia-like cells, whose processes converge to form a ring that completely encircles the nodes. In OMgp-null mice, CNS nodes were abnormally wide and collateral sprouting was observed. Nodal ensheathment in the CNS may stabilize the node and prevent axonal sprouting.

The underlying cause of cis-acting regulatory variation has been identified in only a handful of the hundreds of genes shown to display differential allelic expression. In this report, we describe a systematic effort to map common cis-acting variants in 64 genes, using association methods in HapMap samples. We identified 16 loci (25%), each of which harbors common haplotypes that affect total expression of a gene, and a further 17 loci (27%) with evidence of haplotypes affecting relative allelic expression in heterozygote samples. Our survey suggests that detailed mapping of allele-specific in vivo expression will provide a rich source of regulatory SNPs or haplotypes that should be given high priority in association studies of human phenotypes.

Spinal microglia stimulated by ATP contribute to tactile allodynia, a highly debilitating symptom of pain induced by nerve injury(4). Signalling between microglia and neurons is therefore an essential link in neuropathic pain transmission, but how this signalling occurs is unknown. Here we show that ATP-stimulated microglia cause a depolarizing shift in the anion reversal potential (E-anion) in spinal lamina I neurons. This shift inverts the polarity of currents activated by GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid), as has been shown to occur after peripheral nerve injury(5). Applying brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) mimics the alteration in Eanion. Blocking signalling between BDNF and the receptor TrkB reverses the allodynia and the E-anion shift that follows both nerve injury and administration of ATP-stimulated microglia. ATP stimulation evokes the release of BDNF from microglia. Preventing BDNF release from microglia by pretreating them with interfering RNA directed against BDNF before ATP stimulation also inhibits the effects of these cells on the withdrawal threshold and E-anion. Our results show that ATP-stimulated microglia signal to lamina I neurons, causing a collapse of their transmembrane anion gradient, and that BDNF is a crucial signalling molecule between microglia and neurons. Blocking this microglia-neuron signalling pathway may represent a therapeutic strategy for treating neuropathic pain.

Two members of the Kv3 channel family, AptKv3.1 and AptKv3.3, are coexpressed in these neurons. AptKv3.3 channels are expressed at uniformly high levels in each of four ELL segments, whereas AptKv3.1 channels appear to be expressed in a graded manner with higher levels of expression in segments that process high-frequency electrosensory signals. Immunohistochemical and recombinant channel expression studies show a differential distribution of these two channels in the dendrites of ELL pyramidal neurons. AptKv3.1 is concentrated in somas and proximal dendrites, whereas AptKv3.3 is distributed throughout the full extent of the large dendritic tree. Recombinant channel expression of AptKv3 channels through in vivo viral injections allowed directed retargeting of AptKv3 subtypes over the somadendritic axis, revealing that the sequence responsible for targeting channels to distal dendrites lies within the C-terminal domain of the AptKv3.3 protein. The targeting domain includes a consensus sequence predicted to bind to a PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/Discs large/zona occludens-1)-type protein-protein interaction motif. These findings reveal that different functional roles for Kv3 potassium channels at the somatic and dendritic level of a sensory neuron are attained through specific targeting that selectively distributes Kv3.3 channels to the dendritic compartment.

However, their role in neuropathic pain is controversial. In this paper, changes in the innervation patterns of epidermal sensory afferent fibres in the rat lower lip have been studied following bilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the mental nerve-a purely sensory branch of the trigeminal nerve. Sections of the lower lip were processed for immunocytochemistry using antibodies against Protein Gene Product (PGP) 9.5 and Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) to identify the non-peptidergic and the peptidergic populations of nociceptive small diameter primary sensory afferent fibres. Peptidergic fibres co-localised both markers and the non-peptidergic fibres only stained for PGP 9.5 and not for CGRP. We quantified the total fibre length per 6000 mu m(2) in the epidermis at several time points following CCI. Our data indicate that both fibre populations were significantly decreased at 2 weeks post-CCI, followed by fibre re-growth at levels above those seen in sham-operated animals at 4 weeks; however, this increase was only statistically significant for the non-peptidergic population. At 8 weeks post-CCI, the fibre lengths of both populations did not differ significantly from shams. This transient hyper-innervation of the epidermis by one subpopulation of nociceptive fibres coincided with the occurrence of spontaneous pain or dysesthetic sensations which we detected in a previous study in the same animal model. Therefore, we speculate that this transient hyper-innervation of the epidermis following injury could play a role in nociception in these animals. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we define an essential proapoptotic role for p63 during naturally occurring neuronal death. Sympathetic neurons express full-length TAp63 during the developmental death period, and TAp63 levels increase following NGF withdrawal. Overexpression of TAp63 causes neuronal apoptosis in the presence of NGF, while cultured p63(-/-) neurons are resistant to apoptosis following NGF withdrawal. TAp63 is also essential in vivo, since embryonic p63(-/-) mice display a deficit in naturally occurring sympathetic neuron death. While both TAp63 and p53 induce similar apoptotic signaling proteins and require BAX expression and function for their effects, TAp63 induces neuronal death in the absence of p53, but p53 requires coincident p63 expression for its proapoptotic actions. Thus, p63 is essential for developmental neuronal death, likely functioning both on its own, and as an obligate proapoptotic partner for p53.

Recent evidence suggests that hypothalamic malonyl-CoA functions in the regulation of feeding behavior by altering the expression of key orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides. Here we report that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside ( AICAR), a 5'-AMP kinase activator, rapidly lowers malonyl-CoA both in GT1-7 hypothalamic neurons and in the hypothalami of mice. These effects correlate closely with the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, an established target of AMP kinase. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)administration of AICAR rapidly lowers hypothalamic [malonyl-CoA] and increases food intake. Expression of an adenoviral cytosolic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase vector ( Ad-cMCD) in hypothalamic GT1-7 cells decreases malonyl-CoA. When delivered by bilateral stereotaxic injection into the ventral hypothalamus ( encompassing the arcuate nucleus) of mice, Ad-cMCD increases food intake and body weight. Ad-MCD delivered into the ventral hypothalamus also reverses the rapid suppression of food intake caused by i.c.v.-administered C75, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor that increases hypothalamic [malonyl-CoA]. Taken together these findings implicate malonyl-CoA in the hypothalamic regulation of feeding behavior.

In recent years there has been a trend towards the collection of very large MRI databases which can allow for the detection of very small group-dependent effects. However, the logistical challenges of analysing such large datasets presents new challenges. This paper describes the "pipeline" framework developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute for the fully automated morphometric analysis of large brain imaging databases. The potential use of these techniques is illustrated by examples of their applications in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and pediatric development.

Design: Electromyographic evaluation of trunk muscles. Setting: University spine biomechanics laboratory. Participants: Seventy asymptomatic men (mean age, 34.5y). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: "Balancers" and "nonbalancers were identified by principal component analysis of their lumbar spine side flexion angle during sitting balance. Average electromyographic levels were used as a measure of muscle activation. Pearson correlations were used to identify coactivation versus asymmetrical muscle activation of opposite muscle groups. Results: External oblique, internal oblique, and thoracic erector spinae (TES) were most active, and most likely to be used asymmetrically, with other muscles showing low levels of coactivation. Between groups, the average electromyographic levels in the balancers was lower than in the nonbalancers (P <.05), with further differences in the symmetry of external oblique, internal oblique, and TES activation between groups. Conclusions: Sitting balance in the frontal plane appears to involve a combined feedforward-feedback strategy of muscle activation. Successful balance was characterized by low levels of muscle coactivity, along with higher levels of asymmetric activation in the global trunk muscles, specifically external oblique, internal oblique, and TES.

Eight nondependent. nontreatment-seeking cocaine users self-administered 3 doses of cocaine (0.6, 1.5, 3.0 mg/kg, taken intranasally) following ingestion of (a) a nutritionally balanced amino acid mixture, (b) APTD, and (c) APTD followed by L-dopa/carbidopa (2 X 100 mg/25 mg). APTD decreased both cue-and cocaine-induced drug craving but not euphoria or self-administration. APTD + L-dopa also decreased drug craving, possibly reflecting the ability Of L-dopa to transiently decrease dopamine cell firing. Together, these preliminary results suggest that the craving elicited by cocaine and cocaine cues is related to changes in catecholamine neurotransmission. Euphoria and the self-administration of freely available drugs by regular users, in comparison, might be better accounted for by other mechanisms.

It is commonly assumed that behavioral sensitization is expressed in the environment explicitly paired with the drug but not in a different environment explicitly unpaired with the drug. The experiments reported here show that this assumption is incorrect. It was found that sensitization was expressed in an environment explicitly unpaired with amphetamine, but imbued with positive affective valence by its association with a natural reward, oral sucrose. These results suggest that the affective valence of the environment in which the drug is administered plays a decisive role in the expression of drug effects, regardless of any previous association of that environment with the drug.

Both dendritic spines and molecules within the membrane are able to move, but the physiological role of these movements is unclear. in the developing brain, spines show highly dynamic behaviour thought to facilitate new synaptic connections. Dynamic movements also occur in adults but the role of this movement is unclear. we have studied the effects of the most important excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamat, and found receptor activation to enhance movement of molecules within the spine membrane. This action of glutamate may be important in regulating the trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors that mediate change in synaptic function. In addition, we have studied the dynamic interactions between pre- and postsynaptic structures labelled with FM 4-64 and a membrane-targeted GFP (green fluorescent protein), respectively, in hippocampal slice cultures under conditions of increased activity, such as epilepsy. Our findings suggest a novel form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity where spontaneous glutamate release is sufficient to trigger changes in the hippocampal microcircuitry by attracting neighbouring spines responsive to an enhanced level of extracellular glutamate.

Clinically, they present with epilepsy and developmental handicaps in both children and adults. Here we describe their occurrence together as the two major findings in a group of at least three cortical malformation syndromes. We identified 30 patients as having both PNH and PMG on brain imaging, reviewed clinical data and brain imaging studies (or neuropathology summary) for all, and performed mutation analysis of FLNA in nine patients. The group was divided into three subtypes based on brain imaging findings. The frontal-perisylvian PNH-PMG subtype included eight patients (seven males and one female) between 2 days and 10 years of age. It was characterized by PNH lining the lateral body and frontal horns of the lateral ventricles and by PMG most severe in the posterior frontal and perisylvian areas, occasionally with extension to the parietal lobes beyond the immediate perisylvian cortex. The posterior PNH-PMG subtype consisted of 20 patients (15 male and 5 female) between 5 days and 40 years of age. It was characterized by PNH in the trigones, temporal and posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, and PMG most severe in the temporo-parieto-occipital regions. The third type was found in 2 females aged 7 months and 2 years, and was characterized by severe congenital microcephaly and more diffuse cortical abnormality. The PNH-PMG subtypes described here have distinct imaging and clinical phenotypes that suggest multiple genetic aetiologies involving defects in multiple genes, and a shared pathophysiological mechanism for PNH and PMG. The frontal-perisylvian and posterior subtypes both had skewing of the sex ratio towards males, which suggests the possibility of X-linked inheritance. Delineation of these syndromes will also aid in providing more accurate diagnosis and prognostic information for patients with these malformations.

Generally, a schizoaffective diagnosis is associated with better prognosis on the level of social integration. It is also well established that cognition is an important factor for good social outcome in schizophrenia. We hypothesized that, although patients suffering from SA share symptoms with SZ, they can be differentiated on the basis of neurocognitive function and that SA perform better in several domains. Method: Performances of two groups SA (N = 13) and SZ (N = 44) were compared on several visual-motor tasks using CANTAB [Motor Screening (MOT), Reaction Time (RTI), Paired Associates Learning Task (PAL), and Stockings of Cambridge items (SOC)]. The two groups were matched for symptom severity. ANOVA with repeated measures was employed to determine whether any difference in cognitive scores during a 2-year period was significantly related to the diagnostic status. Results: A significant and durable difference was observed between SZ and SA on motor screening and explicit memory tests where SA performed better. Conclusion: Neurocognitive tests may be relevant for distinguishing schizoaffective from schizophrenia, chiefly via tests tapping into visuo-spatial and visuo-motor coordination abilities (e.g., paired associated learning and motor screening).

This visual agnosia may stem from difficulties in establishing appropriate visual boundaries between visually similar objects. In support of this hypothesis, Saumier, Arguin, Chertkow, and Renfrew (2001) showed that AD subjects have difficulties in establishing visual category boundaries between continuously graded shapes. In an attempt to investigate the neural basis of these impairments, the current study required a group of neurologically healthy elderly participants to categorically classify a series of ellipses varying in width while regional blood flow changes were measured using positron emission tomography (PET). Two categorization conditions were compared in order to isolate changes in cortical activity that dissociated the categorization of shapes situated either near or far from a category boundary that divided the width continuum. The participants produced a discontinuity in the probability and speed of categorizing the shapes at some point along the continuum, suggesting that the objects were classified into distinct categories. Moreover, a comparison of the PET scans obtained while the subjects were categorizing the shapes situated near vs. far form the category boundary revealed significant differences in cortical activity in the parietal and frontal brain areas. These findings suggest that both visuo-spatial and decision making mechanisms may be involved in establishing categorical distinctions between continuously graded stimuli. It is proposed that the functional role of the parietal and frontal cortical regions in establishing visual boundaries between categories of objects may be relevant for understanding object recognition impairments in AD.

J	Klepousniotou, E; Baum, SR				Klepousniotou, E; Baum, SR			Processing homonymy and polysemy: Effects of sentential context and time-course following unilateral brain damage	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						brain laterality; sentential context; lexical ambiguity; homonymy; metonymy; metaphor	LEXICAL AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION; NONTHALAMIC SUBCORTICAL LESIONS; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; DISCOURSE COMPREHENSION; BROCAS-APHASIA; WORD MEANINGS; ACCESS; INDIVIDUALS; INFORMATION; SENSITIVITY	The present study investigated the abilities of left-hemisphere-damaged (LHD) non-fluent aphasic, right-hemisphere-damaged (RHD), and normal control individuals to access, in sentential biasing contexts, the multiple meanings of three types of ambiguous words, namely homonyms (e.g., "punch"), metonymies (e.g., "rabbit"), and metaphors (e.g., "star"). Furthermore, the predictions of the "suppression deficit" and "coarse semantic coding" hypotheses, which have been proposed to account for RH language function/ dysfunction, were tested. Using an auditory semantic priming paradigm, ambiguous words were incorporated in dominant- or subordinate-biasing sentence-primes followed after a short (100 ms) or long (1000 ms) interstimulus interval (ISI) by dominant-meaningrelated, subordinate-meaning-related or unrelated target words. For all three types of ambiguous words, both the effects of context and ISI were obvious in the performance of normal control subjects, who showed multiple meaning activation at the short ISI, but eventually, at the long ISI, contextually appropriate meaning selection. Largely similar performance was exhibited by the LHD nonfluent aphasic patients as well. In contrast, RHD patients showed limited effects of context, and no effects of the time-course of processing. In addition, although homonymous and metonymous words showed similar patterns of activation (i.e., both meanings were activated at both ISIs), RHD patients had difficulties activating the subordinate meanings of metaphors, suggesting a selective problem with figurative meanings. Although the present findings do not provide strong support for either the "coarse semantic coding" or the "suppression deficit" hypotheses, they are viewed as being more consistent with the latter, according to which RH damage leads to deficits suppressing alternative meanings of ambiguous words that become incompatible with the context.

Methods and procedure: Three hundred and thirty-five patients were included in this analysis. Variables considered were age, education, initial score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), duration of post-traumatic amnesia ( PTA), cerebral imaging results and the need for neurosurgical intervention. Experimental interventions: Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Main outcomes and results: Results of this analysis indicated better cognitive FIM at discharge from acute care settings for patients with TBI when PTA was less than 24 hours, when level of education was higher, when no parietal lesion was identified, when no neurosurgical intervention was required, for patients with TBI who were younger and who presented with a higher GCS score upon admission. Conclusions: This model will help to plan resource allocation for treatment and discharge planning within the first weeks following TBI.

Thus, they represent novel tools to study and visualize NPY receptors in living cells.

Aims To identify in schizophrenia the brain regions in which activity is consistently abnormal across imaging studies of memory Method Data from 18 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were combined using a recently developed quantitative meta-analytic approach. Results Regions of consistent differential activation between groups were observed in the left inferior prefrontal cortex, medial temporal cortex bilaterally, left cerebellum, and in other prefrontal and temporal lobe regions. Subsequent analyses explored memory encoding and retrieval separately and identified between-group differences in specific prefrontal and medial temporal lobe regions. Conclusions Beneath the apparent heterogeneity of published findings on schizophrenia and memory, a consistent and robust pattern of group differences is observed as a function of memory processes.

However, findings have been confounded by sample nonspecificity and explicit cognitive task interference with emotion processing. We aimed to further investigate this by examining the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activation in response to the passive viewing of sad film excerpts. Methods: We presented film excerpts depicting sad and neutral social situations to 25 schizophrenia patients (14 with blunted affect [BA+] and I I without blunted affect [BA-]) in an implicit perception task to evoke prefronto-limbic activity illustrated by blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: A random-effects analysis (2-sample t test) using statistical parametric mapping indicated that BA+ patients differed from BA- patients at a 0.05 level (P corrected for multiple comparisons). Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, BA- patients (relative to BA+ patients) showed significant activation in the right VLPFC. An exploratory analysis revealed the following loci of activation: caudate nucleus, VLPFC, middle prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior temporal pole in the BA- group; and hippocampus, cerebellum, anterior temporal pole, and midbrain in the BA+ group. Conclusions: We observed not only hypofrontality in the BA+ group but also dysfunctional circuitry distributed throughout the brain. The temporal and midbrain activation seen in the BA+ group may indicate that these brain regions were working harder to compensate for inactivation in other regions. These distributed dysfunctional circuits may form the neural basis of blunted affect through impairment of emotion processing in the brain that prevents it from processing input efficiently and producing output effectively, thereby leading to symptoms such as blunted affect.

A visuospatial component of attention was explored using a visual search paradigm in which target and distractors were displayed either unilaterally within a single visual hemifield, or bilaterally across both visual hemifields in light of prior work indicating that split-brain patients were twice as fast to scan bilateral displays compared to unlateral displays. A central component of attention was explored using a psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm in which two visual stimuli were presented laterally, at various stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), with each stimulus associated with a different speeded two-alternative choice task. The stimulus-responsc compatibility in the second task was systematically manipulated in this paradigm, in light of prior work indicating that split-brain patients exhibited a close-to-normal PRP effect (i.e., slowing of the second response as SOA is decreased), with, however, abnormally decreasing effects of the manipulation of the response mapping on the second task speed as SOA was decreased. The present results showed that, although generally slower than normals in carrying out the two tasks, the performance of each of the three acallosal patients was formally equivalent to the performance of a matched control group of normal individuals. In the visual search task, the search rate of the acallosal patients was the same for unilateral and bilateral displays. Furthermore, in the PRP task, there was more mutual interference between the lateralised tasks for the acallosal patients than that evidenced in the performance of the matched control group. It is concluded that the visuospatial component and the central component of attention in agenesis of the corpus callosum are interhemispherically integrated systems.

The bHLH-PAS transcription factors SIM1 and SIM2 are coexpressed in the developing MB. We have found that MB neurons are generated and that they survive at least until E18.5 in embryos lacking both Sim1 and Sim2 (Sim1(-/-); Sim2(-/-)). However, the MTT and MTEG are histologically absent in Sim1(-/-),-Sim2(-/-) embryos, and are reduced in embryos lacking Sim1 but bearing one or two copies of Sim2, indicating a contribution of the latter to the development of MB axons. We have generated, by homologous recombination, a null allele of Sim1 (Sim1(tlz)) in which the tau-lacZ fusion gene was introduced, allowing the staining of MB axons. Consistent with the histological studies, lacZ staining showed that the MTT/MTEG is barely detectable in Sim1(tlz/tlz); Sim2(+/-) and Sim1(tlz/tlz); Sim2(-/-) brains. Instead, MB axons are splayed and grow towards the midline. Slit1 and Slit2, which code for secreted molecules that induce the repulsion of ROBO1-producing axons, are expressed in the midline at the level of the MB, whereas Robo1 is expressed in the developing MB. The expression of Rig-1/Robo3, a negative regulator of Slit signalling, is upregulated in the prospective MB of Sim1/Sim2 double mutants, raising the possibility that the growth of mutant MB axons towards the midline is caused by a decreased sensitivity to SLIT.

Two adaptive ANN models are proposed and tested: accumulative training and sliding window training. The computational experiments presented in the paper use both simulated (synthetic) data and measured data. In the case of synthetic data, the accumulative training technique appears to have an almost equal performance with the sliding window training approach, in terms of training time and accuracy. In the case of real measurements, the sliding window technique gives better results, compared with the accumulative training, if the coefficient of variance is used as an indicator.

Tonic status epilepticus (TSE) in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is not well recognized. The objective of this study is to report episodes of TSE in patients with IGE. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and EEG evaluation of three IGE patients who presented TSE. Results. The three patients had mainly clinical features of IGE, but had developed, in addition, focal discharges, diffuse EEG abnormalities and some focal or diffuse neuropsychological dysfunction. The tonic attacks eventually responded to treatment, but were not completely controlled in any of the patients. Discussion. The continuum between IGE and secondary generalized epilepsy is demonstrated in these patients. Most of their clinical and EEG features are however, in keeping with an idiopathic generalized epileptic process with additional focal and diffuse components. Recognition of the significance of TSE in such patients has important therapeutic and prognostic implications.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), abnormalities in corticostriatal interactions are believed to play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Previously, we have reported that, in healthy subjects, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of motor cortex (MC) induces focal dopamine release in the ipsilateral putamen. In the present study, using [C-11]raclopride PET, we sought to investigate early PD patients with evidence of unilateral motor symptoms. We measured in the putamen changes in extracellular dopamine concentration following rTMS (intensity, 90% of the resting motor threshold; frequency, 10 Hz) of the left and right MC. The main objective was to identify potential differences in corticostriatal dopamine release between the hemisphere associated with clear contralateral motor symptoms (symptomatic hemisphere) and the presymptomatic stage of the other hemisphere (asymptomatic hemisphere). Repetitive TMS of MC caused a binding reduction in the ipsilateral putamen of both hemispheres. In the symptomatic hemisphere, while the amount of TMS-induced dopamine release was, as expected, smaller, the size of the significant cluster of change in [C-11]raclopride binding was, instead, 61.4% greater than in the asymptomatic hemisphere. This finding of a spatially enlarged area of dopamine release, following cortical stimulation, may represent a possible in vivo expression of a loss of functional segregation of cortical information to the striatum and an indirect evidence of abnormal corticostriatal transmission in early PD. This has potential implications for models of basal ganglia function in PD.

To elucidate whether these neurons form part of the central pattern generator (CPG) for mastication, we performed intracellular recordings in brainstem slices taken from young rats. Two cell types were defined, nonbursting (63%) and bursting (37%). In response to membrane depolarization, bursting cells, which dominated in the dorsal part of the NVsnpr, fired an initial burst followed by single spikes or recurring bursts. Non-bursting neurons, scattered throughout the nucleus, fired single action potentials. Microstimulation applied to the trigeminal motor nucleus (NVmt), the reticular border zone surrounding the NVmt, the parvocellular reticular formation or the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis (NPontc) elicited a postsynaptic potential in 81% of the neurons tested for synaptic inputs. Responses obtained were predominately excitatory and sensitive to glutamatergic antagonists DNQX and/or APV. Some inhibitory and biphasic responses were also evoked. Bicuculline methiodide or strychnine blocked the IPSPs indicating that they were mediated by GABA(A) or glycinergic receptors. About one-third of the stimulations activated both types of neurons antidromically, mostly from the masseteric motoneuron pool of NVmt and dorsal part of NPontc. In conclusion, our new findings show that some neurons in the dorsal NVsnpr display both firing properties and axonal connections which support the hypothesis that they may participate in masticatory pattern generation. Thus, the present data provide an extended basis for further studies on the organization of the masticatory CPG network.

There have been few empirical tests of this hypothesis, however, and the mechanisms linking behavioral changes and diversification processes remain controversial. We show here that Holarctic passerines with large brain size relative to body size, a character correlated with a high propensity for behavioral changes, generally have experienced more extensive subspecific diversification. This effect appears to be largely independent of other well-known mechanisms thought to promote diversification. As suggested by path analysis, relative brain size seems to affect diversification directly rather than indirectly through its presumed effect on range expansion, which is consistent with the original formulation of the behavioral drive hypothesis. Thus, the results support the long-held, intuitive hypothesis that behavioral changes facilitate evolutionary diversification.

The aim of this study was to investigate this alteration in primary rat brain endothelia. Spectrophotometric analysis of culture media revealed that only a higher concentration of pyrithiamine, which accelerates the intracellular blocking of thiamine, significantly elevated the lactate level and lactate dehydrogenase activity within 7 days. The medium without pyrithiamine and with a thiamine concentration comparable to pathophysiological plasma levels mildly reduced only the activity of transketolase. This suggests that significant metabolic changes may not occur at the early phase of TD in cerebral capillary cells. while anaerobic glycolysis in capillaries may be mediated during late stage/chronic TD.

We have used a mouse model to study the genetic basis of susceptibility, using the inbred strains A/J and C57BL/6J, which are susceptible and resistant, respectively, based on different parameters of the response to infection. To identify genes responsible for this differential host response, brain and kidney fungal load were measured in 128 [A/J x C57BL/6J] F-2 mice 48 h after infection with 5 x 10(4) C. albicans blastospores. Segregation analysis in this informative population identified complement component 5 (C5/Hc) as the major gene responsible for this differential susceptibility (LOD of 22.7 for kidney, 19.0 for brain), with a naturally occurring mutation that causes C5 deficiency leading to enhanced susceptibility. C5 was also found to control heart fungal load, survival time, and serum TNF-alpha levels during infection. Investigation of the response to C. albicans challenge in a series of AcB/BcA recombinant congenic strains validated the importance of C5 in determining the host response. However, the strains BcA67 and BcA72 showed discordant phenotypes with respect to their C5 status, suggesting additional complexity in the genetic control of the inter-strain difference in susceptibility observed in A/J and C57BL/6J following systemic infection with C. albicans.

The latter is the main diagnostic criterion of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), which is a related but distinct disorder. The genetic factors underlying the differences between schwannornatosis and NF2 are poorly understood, although available evidence implicates chromosome 22 as the primary location of the gene(s) of interest. To investigate this, we comprehensively profiled the DNA copy number in samples from sporadic and familial schwannomatosis, NF2, and a large cohort of normal controls. Using a tiling,path chromosome 22 genomic array, we identified two candidate regions of copy number variation, which were further characterized by a PCR-based array with higher resolution. The latter approach allows the detection of minute alterations in total genomic DNA, with as little as 1.5 kb per measurement point of nonredundant sequence on the array. In DNA derived from peripheral blood from a schwannomatosis patient and a sporadic schwannoma sample, we detected rearrangements of the immunoglobulin lambda (IGL) locus, which is unlikely to be due to a B-cell specific somatic recombination of IGL. Analysis of normal controls indicated that these IGL rearrangements were restricted to schwarmornatosis/ schwannoma. samples. In the second candidate region spanning GSTT1 and CABIN1 genes, we observed a frequent copy number polymorphism at the GSTT1 locus. We further describe missense mutations in the CABINI gene that are specific to samples from schwannornatosis and NF2 and make this gene a plausible candidate for contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders.

The proposed front-end preamplifier is composed of a photodetector, a transimpedance preamplifier, a two-stage voltage amplifier and a mixer. Strict constraints regarding noise thus have to be considered. The preamplifier consists of a transimpedance block featuring a 95-dB Omega gain and an average input current noise density at the frequency of interest of approximately 3 pA/root H-z. Each of the two subsequent voltage amplifiers allows the user to obtain an additional 25-dB gain. Considering the tuning capabilities and the losses due to the filters and the nonideal buffers, the proposed front-end allows us to obtain a total gain up to 145 dB. The back-end of the amplification chain is composed of a mixer which is used to produce a continuous voltage proportional to the amplitude of the input optical signals. All those features were integrated using CMOS 0.18-mu m technology and the experimental results are in agreement with the initial design requirements.

The goal is to demonstrate the capability of current technology to closely recreate the human body's reaction to a change of temperature. This is accomplished by creating a function that adds a number of kernels at different frequencies depending on the external temperature. Once the sum of the kernels reaches a certain threshold, the artificial neural network, equivalent to its biological counterpart, "reacts" by sending a specific output signal designed to trigger a response. The various elements of each subsystem are discussed and implemented in software and hardware. The results are analyzed in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to the biological equivalent.

SLC12A6 is localized on chromosome 15q14, a region where linkage to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has previously been shown. Mutation analysis of SLC12A6 was carried out by direct sequencing of PCR-generated DNA fragments in two affected members of a multiplex family, and three non-affected individuals. A case-control study was performed to assess association of variants with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a large sample. Several variants including two rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (G/A, G/A) in the promoter and 5'-UTR, and a thymidine insertion in intron 4 were found. The two G variants and the insertion variant were co-inherited with chromosome 15-related schizophrenia in a large family that strongly supports the region on chromosome 15q14-15 between markers D15S144 and D15S132.

As genetic research suggests that ADHD may be better viewed as an extreme on a continuum rather than a distinct entity, here we examined this issue in boys from the normal population. Method: From an initial sample of 1811, two groups of boys characterised by very high (n = 58) or very low (n = 68) levels of ADHD-type behaviours were formed. The groups completed the spatially sensitive Line Bisection test and more general measures of (non-spatial) attention and intellectual function. Results: Boys whose bisections were consistent with relative inattention to the left indeed had higher ratings of ADHD-type behaviours and performed significantly more poorly on tests of sustained attention and executive function than boys whose bisections were in the normal range. In contrast, boys who showed extreme bisections in the opposite direction were not unusual either in ratings or test performance. Conclusions: The results support an association between poor attention and a relative rightward bias in visual awareness that may stem from right hemisphere inefficiency.

Mirroring its cerebro-protective effects in other clinical conditions, the induction of mild hypothermia may provide a potential therapeutic approach to the management of ALF. A solid mechanistic rationale for the use of mild hypothermia is provided by clinical and experimental studies showing its beneficial effects in relation to many of the key factors that determine the development of brain edema and intracranial hypertension in ALF, namely the delivery of ammonia to the brain, the disturbances of brain organic osmolytes and brain extracellular amino acids, cerebro-vascular haemodynamics, brain glucose metabolism, inflammation, subclinical seizure activity and alterations of gene expression. Initial uncontrolled clinical studies of mild hypothermia in patients with ALF suggest that it is an effective, feasible and safe approach. Randomized controlled clinical trials are now needed to adequately assess its efficacy, safety, clinical impact on global outcomes and to provide the guidelines for its use in ALF.

Since oxidative stress has been shown to be increased in SHR, the present studies were undertaken to examine the role of oxidative stress in enhanced expression of Gi alpha proteins in SHR. Methods Aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from 12-week-old SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used for the present studies. The levels of inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (Gi alpha-2 and Gi alpha-3) and stimulatory proteins (Gs alpha) were determined by western blotting techniques. Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined by measuring. [P-32]cAMP formation from[(alpha-P-32]ATP. Results VSMC from SHR exhibited enhanced expression of Gia-2 and Gia-3 proteins as compared with age-matched WKY rats; however, the levels of Gs alpha proteins were not different between the two groups. The levels of superoxide anion (O-2(-)) were also increased in SHR as compared with WKY rats, and losartan, an AT, receptor antagonist, restored the enhanced levels to control WKY rat levels. Treatment of VSMC with antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) for 24 h decreased the enhanced expression of Gi alpha-2 and Gi alpha-3 proteins in a concentration-dependent manner in VSMC from SHR. In addition, the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity by low concentrations of GTRyS (receptor-independent Gi functions) and C-ANP(4-23)-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (receptor-dependent Gi functions) that were significantly enhanced in SHR were restored to WKY rat levels by NAC and DPI treatments. Similarly, diminished stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by GTR gamma S, isoproterenol and sodium fluoride in SHR was also restored towards control WKY rat levels by NAC and DPI treatments. Furthermore, PD98059, a selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase, was able to restore the enhanced expression of Gi alpha proteins in VSMC from SHR towards WKY rat levels. In addition, the enhanced activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in SHR as compared with WKY rats, as demonstrated by enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, was also restored to WKY rat levels by NAC or DPI. Conclusions These results suggest that enhanced levels of Gia proteins and associated functions in SHR may be attributed to the enhanced oxidative stress present in SHR, which exerts its effects through the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.

This article examines the relationship of their early experiences to functioning and symptoms in later adulthood. The same follow-up interview of 81 adults (41 women, 40 men) at a mean age of 59.2 years included assessments of their current symptoms and functioning. The mean adult Social and Occupational Functioning Score (57.8; 95% CI, 54.7-61.0) indicated moderate difficulty. Psychiatric symptoms were significantly higher than in a matched population survey sample from Quebec. Mean overall defensive functioning indicated a neurotic (inhibited) level. Total trauma and childhood strengths predicted adult outcomes, but childhood strengths moderated the effects of trauma. Institutionalization of children-if unavoidable-must build in effective safeguards against adverse experiences, especially among children with few strengths, and foster children's strengths to avoid impaired adult outcomes.

We investigated whether reduced expression of TrkA protein might also correlate with the level of cognitive impairment in age-associated cognitive impairment. Quantitative and qualitative measurements of TrkA protein levels in the cortex and nucleus basalis of aged rats that had been well-characterized behaviorally as 'unimpaired', 'mildly impaired' or 'fully impaired' demonstrated significant changes in TrkA expression. In the mildly impaired cognitive state phenotypic silencing of TrkA was detected in neurons expressing TrkA at high density but before cholinergic atrophy or loss of TrkA(+) neurons was detected. In the fully impaired cognitive state a significant loss in TrkA(+) cholinergic neurons together with a more significant phenotypic silencing of TrkA expression then took place. These data suggest that TrkA(+) cholinergic cells are associated with cognition, TrkA could be a biomarker of the cognitive state and phenotypic loss of TrkA precedes neuronal loss and probably sensitizes cells to death. We speculate that neurotrophic deficits may be a shared mechanism for cognitive decline in aging and Alzheimer's disease.

First published September 7, 2005; doi: 10.1152/jn. 00303.2005. The neuronal mechanisms underlying enhanced perception of tactile stimuli with directed attention were investigated using single-unit recordings from primary (S1, n = 53) and secondary (S2, n = 50) somatosensory cortex in macaque monkeys. Neuronal responses to textures scanned under the digit tips (spatial periods, SP, of 2, 3.7 or 4.7 mm) were recorded while attention was directed either to discriminating a change in texture or to the reward and also in a neutral no-task condition. Cell discharge was quantified in three periods of the trials: salient Delta texture (directed attention), postreward, and static (both cases, attention directed to the reward). S1 texture- and non-texture-sensitive cells, as well as S2 non-texture-sensitive cells, showed a modest enhancement of discharge during the salient Delta texture period (similar to 25%) but no change in response gain, consistent with an additive increase in neuronal responsiveness with directed attention. In contrast, S2 texture-related cells showed a larger enhancement with directed attention to salient inputs (82%) and increased response gain, suggesting that directed attention produces a multiplicative increase in S2 responsiveness. During the postreward period, and also in no-task testing, S1 texture-sensitive cells preserved their sensitivity to SP. In contrast, S2 texture, but not non-texture-, sensitive cells showed a marked suppression of discharge and decreased gain after the discrimination response. Together, the results support the notion that S2 discharge reflects stimulus parameters in relation to ongoing behavioral demands. The results also support the existence of two independent attentional mechanisms in somatosensory cortex, one generalized (S1 and S2), and the other focused on S2 texture-related cells.

These various isoforms are necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial, neural, and muscle tissues. Mutations in the dystonin/Bpag1 gene cause dystonia musculorum (dt), a hereditary neuropathy of the mouse characterized by the progressive degeneration of sensory neurons. Several dt mutant alleles exist, most of which have arisen through spontaneous mutations. In this article we demonstrate that the dt locus encodes 107 exons spanning 400 kb. The high frequency of occurrence of spontaneous dt mutants may therefore be a result of the large size of the gene. Analysis of genomic DNA from several dt spontaneous mutant alleles, dt(24J), dt(27J), dt(Alb), and dt(Frk), shows a deletion of the central portion of the gene in dt(Alb) but no large rearrangements or deletions in the other alleles. These other alleles likely have small deletions or rearrangements, or point mutations. To determine the impact of the known and unknown mutations on transcript levels, RT-PCR was performed to detect various coding regions of the dystonin/Bpag1 transcripts in brain and muscle from multiple dt alleles: dt(Tg4), dt(Alb), dt(24J), dt(27J), and dt(Frk). With the exception of dt(Frk), reduced transcript levels were observed for all alleles tested. Such alterations likely result in reduced or absent dystonin/Bpag1 protein levels. Thus, distinct genetic defects lead to a common outcome of reduced transcript expression causing the same phenotype in multiple dt alleles.

However, the numerous etiologies and complications of ALF contribute to the complexity of this condition and render the development of an ideal experimental model of ALF more difficult than expected. Instead, a number of different models that may be used for the study of specific aspects of ALF have been developed. The most common approaches used to induce ALFin experimental animals are surgical procedures, toxic liver injury,or a combination of both. Despite the high prevalence of viral hepatitis worldwide, very few satisfactory viral models of ALF are available. Established and newly developed models of ALF are reviewed.

Accumulation of these ligands in brain was suggested to explain in part the notion of"increased GABAergic tone," the rational for which aroseinitially from reports of a beneficial effect of the selective benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil in HE patients. It was suggested on the basis of the effect of flumazenil in human HE that liver failuremay result in alterations of the density and/or affinity of the benzodiazepine-associated GABA-A receptor site. Subsequent controlled-clinical trials showed that fumazenil had a transient beneficial effect in only a subpopulation of HE patients. In contrast to the antagonists, partial inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor have unequivocal beneficial effects on behavioral and electrophysiologicalperformance in all experimental models of HE studied so far. Benzodiazepine-associated GABA-A receptors have consistently been demonstrated to be unaltered in both human and experimental HE. Contrary to initial reports, the so-called "endogenous benzodiazepines" do not appear to be significantly related to the pathogenesis of HE. On the other hand, nonbenzodiazepine GABA-A receptor complex modulators, such as neurosteroids, recently identified in brain in human and experimental HE, may provide a new mechanistic basis for this disorder and lead to novel treatments for human HE.

We use this lithographic method to tailor fiduciary markers, focal references, and calibration tools, for fluorescence and laser scanning microscopy. Fluorescent microlithography provides spatial landmarks to quantify molecular transport, cell growth and migration, and to compensate for focal drift during time-lapse imaging. We show that the fluorescent patterned microstructures are biocompatible with cultures of mammalian cell lines and hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the high-relief topology of the lithographed substrates is utilized as a mold for poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamps to create protein patterns by microcontact printing, representing an alternative to the current etching techniques. We present two different applications of such protein patterns for localizing cell adhesion and guidance of neurite outgrowth.

They contain a conserved C-terminal WD40 repeat domain that mediates interactions with several DNA-binding proteins. In particular, Gro/TLE1 interacts with forkhead transcription factor brain factor 1 (BF-1; also termed FoxG1). BF-1 is an essential regulator of neuronal differentiation during cerebral cortex development and represses transcription together with Gro/TLE1. Gro/TLE-related gene product 6 (Grg6) shares with Gro/TLEs a conserved WD40 repeat domain but is more distantly related at its N-terminal half. We demonstrate that Grg6 is expressed in cortical neural progenitor cells and interacts with BF-1. In contrast to Gro/TLE1, however, Grg6 does not promote, but rather suppresses, BF-1-mediated transcriptional repression. Consistent with these observations, Grg6 interferes with the binding of Gro/TLE1 to BF-1 and does not repress transcription when targeted to DNA. Moreover, coexpression of Grg6 and BF-1 in cortical progenitor cells leads to a decrease in the number of proliferating cells and increased neuronal differentiation. Conversely, Grg6 knockdown by RNA interference causes decreased neurogenesis. These results identify a new role for Grg6 in cortical neuron development and establish a functional link between Grg6 and BF-1.

The effect is an inability to metabolize phenylalanine (Phe), translating into elevated levels of Phe in the bloodstream (hyperphenylalaninemia). If therapy is not implemented at birth, mental retardation can occur. PKU patients respond to treatment with a low-phenylalanine diet, but compliance with the diet is difficult, therefore the development of alternative treatments is desirable. Enzyme substitution therapy with a recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) is currently being explored. This enzyme converts Phe to the harmless metabolites, trans-cinnamic acid and trace ammonia. Taken orally and when non-absorbable and protected, PAL lowers plasma Phe in mutant hyperphenylalaninemic mouse models. Subcutaneous administration of PAL results in more substantial lowering of plasma and significant reduction in brain Phe levels, however the metabolic effect is not sustained following repeated injections due to an immune response. We have chemically modified PAL by pegylation to produce a protected form of PAL that possesses better specific activity, prolonged half-life, and reduced immunogencity in vivo. Subcutaneous administration of pegylated molecules to PKU mice has the desired metabolic response (prolonged reduction in blood Phe levels) with greatly attenuated immunogenicity.
