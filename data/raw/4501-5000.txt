A Randomized Comparison Between Infraclavicular Block and Targeted Intracluster Injection Supraclavicular Block	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							BRACHIAL-PLEXUS BLOCK; ULTRASOUND; SINGLE	Background and Objectives: This prospective, randomized trial compared ultrasound-guided targeted intracluster injection (TII) supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCB) and infraclavicular brachial plexus block (ICB). Methods: Sixty-four patients were randomly allocated to receive an ultrasound-guided TII SCB (n = 32) or ICB (n = 32). The local anesthetic agent (lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL) was identical in all subjects. In the TII SCB group, half the volume (16 mL) was injected inside the largest neural cluster (confluence of trunks and divisions of the brachial plexus). Subsequently, the remaining half (16 mL) was divided into equal aliquots and injected inside every single satellite cluster. In the ICB group, the entire volume (35 mL) was injected dorsal to the axillary artery. During the performance of the block, the performance time, number of needle passes, procedural pain, and complications (vascular puncture, paresthesia) were recorded. Subsequently, a blinded observer assessed the onset time, incidence of Horner syndrome, and success rate (surgical anesthesia). The main outcome variable was the total anesthesia-related time (sum of performance and onset times). Results: Due to a quicker onset [8.9 (5.6) vs 17.6 (5.3) minutes; P < 0.001], the total anesthesia-related time was shorter with TII SCB [18.2 (6.1) vs 22.8 (5.3) minutes; P < 0.001]. However no differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of success rate (93.7%-96.9%), block-related pain scores, and adverse events such as vascular puncture and paresthesia. Expectedly, the ICB group required fewer needle passes (2 vs 6; P < 0.001) as well as shorter needling [4.8 (2.3) vs 9.0 (2.9) minutes; P < 0.001] and performance [5.6 (2.3) vs 9.5 (2.9) minutes; P < 0.001] times. Moreover, the ICB approach was associated with a decreased incidence of Horner syndrome (3.1% vs 53.1%; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided TII SCB and ICB provide comparable success rates. Due to its quick onset, TII SCB results in a shorter total anesthesia-related time.	[Yazer, Murray S.; Finlayson, Roderick J.; Tran, De Q.

Recently, enhanced striatal volume was associated with greater lifetime nicotine exposure, suggesting a bridge between striatal function and structural phenotypes. To assess this link between striatal structure and function, we evaluated the relationship between striatal morphology and this brain region's well-established role in craving. In tobacco smokers, we assessed striatal volume, surface area, and shape using a new segmentation methodology coupled with local shape indices. Striatal morphology was then related with two measures of craving: state-based craving, assessed by the brief questionnaire of smoking urges (QSU), and craving induced by smoking-related images. A positive association was found between left striatal volume and surface area with both measures of craving. A more specific relationship was found between both craving measures and the dorsal, but not in ventral striatum. Evaluating dorsal striatal subregions showed a single relationship between the caudate and QSU. Although cue-induced craving and the QSU were both associated with enlarged striatal volume and surface area, these measures were differentially associated with global or more local striatal volumes. We also report a connection between greater right striatal shape deformations and cue-induced craving. Shape deformations associated with cue-induced craving were specific to striatal subregions involved in habitual responding to rewarding stimuli, which is relevant given the habitual nature of cue-induced craving. The current findings confirm a relationship between striatal function and morphology and suggest that variation in striatal morphology may be a biomarker for craving severity.

J	Einarsson, EO; Pors, J; Nader, K				Einarsson, Einar Oe; Pors, Jennifer; Nader, Karim			Systems Reconsolidation Reveals a Selective Role for the Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Generalized Contextual Fear Memory Expression	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							RETROGRADE-AMNESIA; REMOTE MEMORIES; STIMULUS ATTRIBUTES; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; TRANSFORMATION; ORGANIZATION; SPECIFICITY; INVOLVEMENT; EXTINCTION	After acquisition, hippocampus-dependent memories undergo a systems consolidation process, during which they become independent of the hippocampus and dependent on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for memory expression. However, consolidated remote memories can become transiently hippocampus-dependent again following memory reactivation. How this systems reconsolidation affects the role of the ACC in remote memory expression is not known. Using contextual fear conditioning, we show that the expression of 30-day-old remote memory can transiently be supported by either the ACC or the dorsal hippocampus following memory reactivation, and that the ACC specifically mediates expression of remote generalized contextual fear memory. We found that suppression of neural activity in the ACC with the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) impaired the expression of remote, but not recent, contextual fear memory. Fear expression was not affected by this treatment if preceded by memory reactivation 6 h earlier, nor was it affected by suppression of neural activity in the dorsal hippocampus with the GABA-receptor agonist muscimol. However, simultaneous targeting of both the ACC and the dorsal hippocampus 6 h after memory reactivation disrupted contextual fear memory expression. Second, we observed that expression of a 30-day-old generalized contextual fear memory in a novel context was not affected by memory reactivation 6 h earlier. However, intra-ACC CNQX infusion before testing impaired contextual fear expression in the novel context, but not the original training context. Together, these data suggest that although the dorsal hippocampus may be recruited during systems reconsolidation, the ACC remains necessary for the expression of generalized contextual fear memory.

Predictive algorithms use high dimensionality data to evaluate the likelihood of an impending seizure. Dimensionality reduction is a key step towards the development of portable prediction systems. In this work, a comparative study of feature selection and classification methods was performed. Based on a Support Vector Machine and an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy inference system, data reduction was performed by combining a minimum redundancy maximum relevance approach for electrodes selection and a genetic algorithm for features selection. The results show that the selected subset of features operates equally and sometimes even better than the whole features set.	[Assi, E.

The design is based on a fully-differential amplifier for enhanced sensitivity and wide dynamic range. Moreover, an error cancellation loop composed of high gain and rejection ratio amplifiers subtracts the voltage drop created by the sense resistor, thus enabling the use of high resistance values for low current sensing with no adverse effect on the biosensor's dynamic range; as a result, the sensitivity of the circuit is considerably improved. Implementing this biosensor with discrete components led to a current sensitivity of 10 nA, an accuracy of 0.1 % and a CMRR of 83 dB.

Many predictors have been proposed and studied for the single queue system, but barely any predictor currently exists for the multi-skill case. We introduce two new predictors that use cubic regression splines and artificial neural networks, respectively, and whose parameters are optimized (or leamed) from observation data obtained by simulation. In numerical experiments, our proposed predictors are much more accurate than a popular heuristic that uses, as a predictor, the delay of the last customer of the same type that started service.

Cognitive lock-in describes a situation in which a consumer has learned how to use a website, based on repeated interactions with it, with the consequence that more experience reduces the probability to switch to a competitor's website. A major reason for the reduced switching probability is that interaction with an unfamiliar website typically implies high levels of cognitive load. Researchers conducted an experiment measuring cognitive load while consumers performed online purchasing tasks. Results show that participants visiting the same website multiple times have different cognitive load patterns than participants visiting different websites. The former group rapidly moved from controlled processing to automatic processing, which is metabolically less costly, leading to cognitive lock-in. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are discussed.

Advances in high-field MRI allow for the non-invasive identification of hippocampal substructure. These approaches, however, demand time-consuming manual segmentation that relies heavily on anatomical expertise. Here, we share manual labels and associated high-resolution MRI data (MNI-HISUB25; submillimetric T1- and T-2-weighted images, detailed sequence information, and stereotaxic probabilistic anatomical maps) based on 25 healthy subjects. Data were acquired on a widely available 3 Tesla MRI system using a 32 phased-array head coil. The protocol divided the hippocampal formation into three subregions: subicular complex, merged Cornu Ammonis 1, 2 and 3 (CA(1-3)) subfields, and CA(4)-dentate gyrus (CA4-DG). Segmentation was guided by consistent intensity and morphology characteristics of the densely myelinated molecular layer together with few geometry-based boundaries flexible to overall mesiotemporal anatomy, and achieved excellent intra-/inter-rater reliability (Dice index >= 90/87%). The dataset can inform neuroimaging assessments of the mesiotemporal lobe and help to develop segmentation algorithms relevant for basic and clinical neurosciences.

Subjects with a family history of Alzheimer's disease in firstdegree relatives were recruited as part of an on-going double blind randomized clinical trial of Naproxen or placebo. Two pairs of scans were acquired -3 months apart, allowing the assessment of both intra-and inter-session reliability, with the possible caveat of treatment effects as a source of inter-session variation. Using the NeuroImaging Analysis Kit (NIAK), we report on the standard quality of co-registration and motion parameters of the data, and assess their validity based on the spatial distribution of seed-based connectivity maps as well as intra-and inter-session reliability metrics in the default-mode network. This resource, released publicly as sample UM1 of the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), will benefit future studies focusing on the preclinical period preceding the appearance of dementia in Alzheimer's disease.

Reorganization of Auditory Cortex in Early-deaf People: Functional Connectivity and Relationship to Hearing Aid Use	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SIGN-LANGUAGE; HUMAN BRAIN; FMRI; MOTION; ORGANIZATION; AREAS; ACTIVATION	Cross-modal reorganization after sensory deprivation is a model for understanding brain plasticity. Although it is a well-documented phenomenon, we still know little of the mechanisms underlying it or the factors that constrain and promote it. Using fMRI, we identified visual motion-related activity in 17 early-deaf and 17 hearing adults. We found that, in the deaf, the posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) was responsive to visual motion. We compared functional connectivity of this reorganized cortex between groups to identify differences in functional networks associated with reorganization. In the deaf more than the hearing, the STG displayed increased functional connectivity with a region in the calcarine fissure. We also explored the role of hearing aid use, a factor that may contribute to variability in cross-modal reorganization. We found that both the cross-modal activity in STG and the functional connectivity between STG and calcarine cortex correlated with duration of hearing aid use, supporting the hypothesis that residual hearing affects cross-modal reorganization. We conclude that early auditory deprivation alters not only the organization of auditory regions but also the interactions between auditory and primary visual cortex and that auditory input, as indexed by hearing aid use, may inhibit cross-modal reorganization in early-deaf people.

In the current study of 90 healthy volunteers aged 5-32 years (48 females, 85 right handed) with 180 scans (2 scans for each participantwith similar to 4 year gaps), thinning of overall mean thickness and across the four major cortical lobes bilaterally was observed across this full age span. However, the thinning rate, calculated as Delta cortical thickness / Delta age (mm/year) between scans of each participant, revealed an accelerated cortical thinning during adolescence, which was preceded by less thinning in childhood and followed by decelerated thinning in young adulthood. Males and females showed similarly faster thinning rates during adolescence relative to young adults. The underlying basis and role of accelerated cortical thinning during adolescence for cognition, behaviour and disorders that appear at such a stage of development remains to be determined in future work.

Regional differences have been also observed, although most of the available studies apply voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Reports applying surface-based morphometry (SBM) have been focused mainly on cortical thickness (CT). Here we apply SBM for obtaining global and regional indices of CT, cortical surface area (CSA), and cortical gray matter volume (CGMV) from samples of men (N = 40) and women (N = 40) matched for their performance on four cognitive factors varying in their complexity: processing speed, attention control, working memory capacity, and fluid intelligence. These were the main findings: 1) CT and CSA produced very weak correlations in both sexes, 2) men showed larger values in CT, CSA, and CGMV, and 3) cognitive performance was unrelated to brain structural variation within sexes. Therefore, we found substantial group differences in brain structure, but there was no relationship with cognitive performance both between and within-sexes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The present study tested the hypothesis that nestin was expressed in lung fibroblasts and the pattern of expression represented a distinct marker of pulmonary remodeling secondary to myocardial infarction and type I diabetes. Nestin((+)) fibroblasts were detected in rat lungs and a subpopulation exhibited a myofibroblast phenotype delineated by the co-expression of smooth muscle -actin. In the lungs of myocardial infarcted rats, interstitial collagen content and nestin mRNA/protein levels were significantly increased despite the absence of secondary pulmonary hypertension, whereas smooth muscle -actin protein expression was unchanged. Exposure of rat pulmonary fibroblasts to pro-fibrotic stimuli angiotensin II and transforming growth factor- significantly increased nestin protein levels. In the lungs of type I diabetic rats, the absence of a reactive fibrotic response was associated with a significant downregulation of nestin mRNA/protein expression. Nestin was reported a target of miR-125b, albeit miR-125b levels were unchanged in pulmonary fibroblasts treated with pro-fibrotic stimuli. Nestin((+)) cells lacking smooth muscle -actin/collagen staining were also identified in rodent lungs and a transgenic approach revealed that expression of the intermediate filament protein was driven by intron 2 of the nestin gene. The disparate regulation of nestin characterized a distinct pattern of pulmonary remodeling secondary to myocardial infarction and type I diabetes and upregulation of the intermediate filament protein in lung fibroblasts may have facilitated in part the reactive fibrotic response.

Here we report the effect of peginterferon beta-1a on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, and no evidence of disease activity (NEDA; absence of clinical [relapses and 12-week confirmed disability progression] and MRI [gadolinium-enhancing, and new or newly-enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions] disease activity) during Year 1. Methods: RRMS patients (18-65 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale score <= 5) were randomized to double-blind placebo or peginterferon beta-1a 125 mu g every 2 or 4 weeks. Sensitivity analyses of last observation carried forward and composite disease activity (using minimal MRI allowance definitions) were conducted. Results: 1512 patients were randomized and dosed (placebo n = 500; peginterferon beta-1a every 2 [n = 512] or 4 [n = 500] weeks). Every 2 week dosing significantly reduced, versus placebo and every 4 week dosing, the number of new or newly-enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions at Weeks 24 (by 61% and 51%, respectively) and 48 (secondary endpoint; by 67% and 54%, respectively); all p < 0.0001. Every 2 week dosing also provided significant reductions versus placebo and every 4 week dosing in the number of new T1 hypointense, gadolinium-enhancing, and new active (gadolinium-enhancing plus non-enhancing new T2) lesions (all p < 0.0001), as well as the volume of T2 and T1 lesions (p < 0.05) at Weeks 24 and 48. Significantly more patients dosed every 2 weeks had NEDA versus placebo and every 4 weeks (all p < 0.01) from baseline to Week 48 (33.9% versus 15.1% and 21.5%, respectively [odds ratios, ORs: 2.89 and 1.87]), from baseline to Week 24 (41.0% versus 21.9% and 30.7%, [ORs: 2.47 and 1.57]) and from Week 24 to Week 48 (60.2% versus 28.9% and 36.6%, [ORs: 3.71 and 2.62]). Consistent results were seen when allowing for minimal MRI activity. Conclusion: During Year 1 of ADVANCE, significantly more RRMS patients receiving peginterferon beta-1a every 2 weeks had NEDA, and early and sustained improvements in all MRI endpoints, versus placebo and every 4 week dosing. NEDA sensitivity analyses align with switch strategies in clinical practice settings and provide insight into future responders/non-responders.

STAT3 promotes survival of mutant photoreceptors in inherited photoreceptor degeneration models	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						inherited photoreceptor degeneration; Stat3; neuroprotection	LEUKEMIA INHIBITORY FACTOR; PRECONDITIONING-INDUCED PROTECTION; CILIARY NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; RETINAL DEGENERATION; RETINITIS-PIGMENTOSA; TRANSGENIC RATS; RECEPTOR GP130; CELL-DEATH; RCS RATS; GENE	Inherited photoreceptor degenerations (IPDs), a group of incurable progressive blinding diseases, are caused by mutations in more than 200 genes, but little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of photoreceptor (PR) death. Increased retinal expression of STAT3 has been observed in response to many retinal insults, including IPDs, but the role of this increase in PR death is unknown. Here, we show that the expression of Stat3 is increased in PRs of the Tg(RHO P347S) and Prph2(rds/+) mouse models of IPD and is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. PR-specific deletion of Stat3 substantially accelerated PR degeneration in both mutant strains. In contrast, increased PR-specific expression of ROSA26 (R26) alleles encoding either WT STAT3 (Stat3(wt)) or the gain-of-function variant STAT3(C) (Stat3(C)) improved PR survival in both models. Moreover, PR signaling in Tg(RHO P347S) mice carrying either a R26-Stat3(wt) or R26-Stat3(C) allele demonstrated increased a-wave amplitude of the scotopic electroretinogram. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine 705 was required for the prosurvival effect because an R26-Stat3(Y705F) allele was not protective. The prosurvival role of enhanced Stat3 activity was validated using recombinant adenoassociated virus (rAAV) vector-mediated PR Stat3 expression in Tg(RHO P347S) mice. Our findings (i) establish that the increase in endogenous PR Stat3 expression is a protective response in IPDs, (ii) suggest that therapeutic augmentation of PR Stat3 expression has potential as a common neuroprotective therapy for these disorders, and (iii) indicate that prosurvival molecules whose expression is increased in mutant PRs may have promise as novel therapies for IPDs.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare cerebral activation of ADHD and control biological parent-child dyads during forethought, a prospective function of working memory. Reduced activations in ADHD dyads were found in the inferior frontal gyrus, right superior parietal lobule and left inferior parietal lobule. This suggests that fronto-parietal abnormalities are shared within ADHD families. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regions involved in executive control and affective processing/persuasion are activated when viewing the negative value of smoking, but these systems can interact in ways that promote or hinder its impact on behavior. The goal of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (IIMIRI) study was to examine the dynamics between these systems during the processing of images designed to elicit a negative emotional response regarding tobacco smoking in a group of current smokers. Thirty chronic smokers passively viewed aversive smoking related, aversive nonsmoking related and neutral images presented in a block design while being scanned. Functional connectivity analyses showed that the left inferior frontal gyros (IFG) is negatively associated to activity in medial frontal, cingulate, limbic, subcortical and parietal regions in chronic smokers during the processing of aversive smoking related material, a pattern that was si;,Ynificantly greater when stimuli vvere drug related compared with when they were nonclrugrelated. Our results suggest that individuals with tobacco dependence present different patterns of Functional connectivity depending on whether the aversive stimuli are smoking- or nonsmoking-related. Activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus may act to down-regulate corresponding activity in regions key to an affective and persuasive response during the processing of anti-smoking material. This mechanism may reduce the extent to which "feeling bad" brings about a change in behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We show that disruption of the dopamine transporter gene lengthens the period of ultradian locomotor rhythms in mice. Period lengthening also results from chemogenetic activation of midbrain dopamine neurons and psychostimulant treatment, while the antipsychotic haloperidol has the opposite effect. We further reveal that striatal dopamine levels fluctuate in synchrony with ultradian activity cycles and that dopaminergic tone strongly predicts ultradian period. Our data indicate that an arousal regulating, dopaminergic ultradian oscillator (DUO) operates in the mammalian brain, which normally cycles in harmony with the circadian clock, but can desynchronize when dopamine tone is elevated, thereby producing aberrant patterns of arousal which are strikingly similar to perturbed sleep-wake cycles comorbid with psychopathology.

The relationship between sound intensity and loudness is not fixed, and can be modified by short-term sound deprivation or stimulation. Deprivation increases sound sensitivity, whereas stimulation decreases it. We review the effects of short-term auditory deprivation and stimulation on the auditory central nervous system of humans and animals, and we extend the discussion to permanent auditory deprivation (hearing loss) and auditory pathologies of loudness perception. Although there is sufficient evidence to conclude that loudness can be modulated in normal hearing listeners by temporary sound deprivation and stimulation, evidence is scanter for the hearing-impaired listeners. In addition, cortical effects of sound deprivation and stimulation in humans, which may correlate with loudness coding, are still largely unknown and should be the target of future research.

Out of several cellular pathways responsible for this progression, necrosis and apoptosis are situated on the opposite spectrum of cell death regulation. Necrosis produces an environment that promotes inflammation and cytotoxicity and apoptosis is a highly organized process that maintains tissue homeostasis. A recently discovered protein, Nlrx1, regulates inflammatory and cell death responses during infection. Findings: Using transfections of N2A cell line, we demonstrate that Nlrx1 redirects cells away from necrosis and towards an apoptotic pathway following rotenone treatments. In addition, Nlrx1 promotes DRP1 phosphorylation and increases mitochondrial fission. Conclusion: Our results suggest a novel molecular pathway for regulating mitochondrial dynamics and neuronal death. Nlrx1 may play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, where necrosis is a prominent factor.

Modeling C flux plays a critical role in assessing both C cycles and budgets. This study aimed to determine important non-redundant input variables to quantify C flux and to develop a new application of a genetic neural network (GNN) model that accurately simulates C flux. Four input variables (atmospheric CO2 concentration, air temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and relative humidity) were fixed, whereas three additional input variables (wind speed, soil temperature, and rainfall) were randomly combined to compile eight combinations of input variables (CIV 1-CIV 8). C flux and meteorological data were collected over a four-year period between January 2008 and December 2011 at the Huitong National Research Station of Forest Ecosystem. Results showed that CIV 8 (grouping atmospheric CO2 concentration, air temperature, PAR, relative humidity, wind speed, and soil temperature) performed best, yielding a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.87, outlier of 0.79%, and a root mean squares of errors (RMSE) of 0.11. C flux data during summer generally provided the best performance with R-2 ranging from 0.74 to 0.82, volumetric fitting (I-vf) ranging from 1.00 to 1.02, and outliers ranging from 1.20% to 1.40%. Spring data performance ranked second and winter last. When combining seasonal data to reflect the entire year, R-2 ranged from 0.77 to 0.83, I-vf ranged from 0.92 to 0.97, outliers ranged from 1.40% to 1.78%, and RMSE ranged from 0.10 to 0.11, indicating that the GNN model is capable in capturing C flux dynamics while successfully simulating and predicting C flux in a Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation in subtropical China.

Studies have demonstrated that these patterns are organized in space and highly reproducible from subject to subject. Moreover, RSNs reorganizations have been suggested in pathological conditions. Comparisons of RSNs organization have been performed between groups of subjects but have rarely been applied at the individual level, a step required for clinical application. Defining the notion of modularity as the organization of brain activity in stable networks, we propose Detection of Abnormal Networks in Individuals (DANI) to identify modularity changes at the individual level. The stability of each RSN was estimated using a spatial clustering method: Bootstrap Analysis of Stable Clusters (BASC) (Bellect et al., 2010). Our contributions consisted in (i) providing functional maps of the most stable cores of each networks and (ii) in detecting "abnormal" individual changes in networks organization when compared to a population of healthy controls. DANI was first evaluated using realistic simulated data, showing that focussing on a conservative core size (50% most stable regions) improved the sensitivity to detect modularity changes. DANI was then applied to resting state fMRI data of six patients with focal epilepsy who underwent multimodal assessment using simultaneous EEG/fMRI acquisition followed by surgery. Only patient with a seizure free outcome were selected and the resected area was identified using a post-operative MRI. DANI automatically detected abnormal changes in 5 out of 6 patients, with excellent sensitivity, showing for each of them at least one "abnormal" lateralized network closely related to the epileptic focus. For each patient, we also detected some distant networks as abnormal, suggesting some remote reorganization in the epileptic brain.

However, in most studies neuroimaging was done after a significant postnatal period, and in those studies that performed neuroimaging on fetuses, the quality of data has been affected due to complications of scanning during pregnancy. To understand healthy brain development between 37-41 weeks of gestational age, our study assessed the in utero growth of the brain in healthy term born babies with DTI scanning soon after birth. Methods: A cohort of 93 infants recruited from maternity hospitals in Singapore underwent diffusion tensor imaging between 5 to 17 days after birth. We did a cross-sectional examination of white matter microstructure of the brain among healthy term infants as a function of gestational age via voxel-based analysis on fractional anisotropy. Results: Greater gestational age at birth in term infants was associated with larger fractional anisotropy values in early developing brain regions, when corrected for age at scan. Specifically, it was associated with a cluster located at the corpus callosum (corrected p<0.001), as well as another cluster spanning areas of the anterior corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, and external capsule (corrected p<0.001). Conclusions: Our findings show variation in brain maturation associated with gestational age amongst 'term' infants, with increased brain maturation when born with a relatively higher gestational age in comparison to those infants born with a relatively younger gestational age. Future studies should explore if these differences in brain maturation between 37 and 41 weeks of gestational age will persist over time due to development outside the womb.	[Broekman, Birit F.

The present literature review suggests that, in laboratory animals, the systemic administration of DA augmenters preferentially increases susceptibility to premature responding; with continued DA transmission, reward approach behaviors are sustained. Decreases in DA transmission, in comparison, diminish the appeal of distal and difficult to obtain rewards, thereby increasing susceptibility to temporal discounting and other forms of impulsive choice. The evidence available in humans is not incompatible with this model but is less extensive.

Incidence, Predictors, and Prognostic Impact of Late Bleeding Complications After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						aortic stenosis; bleeding; paravalvular leak; TAVR	ACADEMIC RESEARCH CONSORTIUM; VON-WILLEBRAND-SYNDROME; HIGH-RISK PATIENTS; ONSET ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; END-POINT DEFINITIONS; CLINICAL-OUTCOMES; VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS; IMPLANTATION INSIGHTS; ANTIPLATELET THERAPY; CONSENSUS REPORT	BACKGROUND The incidence and prognostic impact of late bleeding complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are unknown. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to identify the incidence, predictors, and prognostic impact of major late bleeding complications (MLBCs) (>= 30 days) after TAVR. METHODS Clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of patients who underwent TAVR within the randomized cohorts and continued access registries in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial were analyzed after stratifying by the occurrence of MLBCs. Predictors of MLBCs and their association with 30-day to 1-year mortality were assessed. RESULTS Among 2,401 patients who underwent TAVR and survived to 30 days, MLBCs occurred in 142 (5.9%) at a median time of 132 days (interquartile range: 71 to 230 days) after the index procedure. Gastrointestinal complications (n = 58 [40.8%]), neurological complications (n = 22 [15.5%]), and traumatic falls (n = 11 [7.8%]) were identified as the most frequent types of MLBCs. Independent predictors of MLBCs were the presence of low hemoglobin at baseline, atrial fibrillation or flutter at baseline or 30 days, the presence of moderate or severe paravalvular leak at 30 days, and greater left ventricular mass at 30 days. MLBCs were identified as a strong independent predictor of mortality between 30 days and 1 year (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.91; 95% confidence interval: 2.67 to 5.71; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS MLBCs after TAVR were frequent and associated with increased mortality. Better individualized and risk-adjusted antithrombotic therapy after TAVR is urgently needed in this high-risk population.

A detailed examination of the morphological relations of the different segments of the complex intraparietal sulcal region in the human brain in standard stereotaxic space, which is a prerequisite for detailed structure-to-function studies, is not available. This study examined the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the related sulcus of Jensen in magnetic resonance imaging brain volumes registered in the Montreal Neurological Institute stereotaxic space. It was demonstrated that the IPS is divided into two branches: the anterior ramus and the posterior ramus of the IPS, often separated by a submerged gyral passage. The sulcus of Jensen emerges between the anterior and posterior rami of the IPS, and its ventral end is positioned between the first and second caudal branches of the superior temporal sulcus. In a small number of brains, the sulcus of Jensen may merge superficially with the first caudal branch of the superior temporal sulcus. The above morphological findings are discussed in relation to previously reported functional neuroimaging findings and provide the basis for future exploration of structure-to-function relations in the posterior parietal region of individual subjects.

J	Nozaradan, S				Nozaradan, Sylvie			Exploring how musical rhythm entrains brain activity with electroencephalogram frequency-tagging	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						music beat and meter perception; steady-state evoked potentials; electroencephalogram; neural entrainment; sensorimotor integration; multisensory integration	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; REPETITIVE FINGER MOVEMENTS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; BEAT PERCEPTION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; MODULATED LIGHT; MOTOR	The ability to perceive a regular beat in music and synchronize to this beat is a widespread human skill. Fundamental to musical behaviour, beat and meter refer to the perception of periodicities while listening to musical rhythms and often involve spontaneous entrainment to move on these periodicities. Here, we present a novel experimental approach inspired by the frequency-tagging approach to understand the perception and production of rhythmic inputs. This approach is illustrated here by recording the human electroencephalogram responses at beat and meter frequencies elicited in various contexts: mental imagery of meter, spontaneous induction of a beat from rhythmic patterns, multisensory integration and sensorimotor synchronization. Collectively, our observations support the view that entrainment and resonance phenomena subtend the processing of musical rhythms in the human brain. More generally, they highlight the potential of this approach to help us understand the link between the phenomenology of musical beat and meter and the bias towards periodicities arising under certain circumstances in the nervous system. Entrainment to music provides a highly valuable framework to explore general entrainment mechanisms as embodied in the human brain.

Most models of beat-tracking rely on the theoretical concept of pulse: a perceived regular beat generated by an internal oscillation that forms the foundation of entrainment abilities. Although tapping to the beat is a natural sensorimotor activity for most individuals, not everyone can track an auditory beat. Recently, the case of Mathieu was documented (Phillips-Silver et al. 2011 Neuropsychologia 49, 961-969. (doi:10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.02.002)). Mathieu presented himself as having difficulty following a beat and exhibited synchronization failures. We examined beat-tracking in normal control participants, Mathieu, and a second beat-deaf individual, who tapped with an auditory metronome in which unpredictable perturbations were introduced to disrupt entrainment. Both beat-deaf cases exhibited failures in error correction in response to the perturbation task while exhibiting normal spontaneous motor tempi (in the absence of an auditory stimulus), supporting a deficit specific to perception-action coupling. A damped harmonic oscillator model was applied to the temporal adaptation responses; the model's parameters of relaxation time and endogenous frequency accounted for differences between the beat-deaf cases as well as the control group individuals.

Exposure to cannabinoids during development results in neurofunctional alterations, which implies that the eCB system is involved in the developmental processes of the brain. Because of their lipophilic nature, eCBs are synthesized on demand and are not stored in vesicles. Consequently, the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and degradation are key regulators of their physiological actions. Therefore, knowing the localization of these enzymes during development is crucial for a better understanding of the role played by eCBs during the formation of the central nervous system. In this study, we investigated the developmental protein localization of the synthesizing and catabolic enzymes of the principal eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the retinas of young and adult rats. The distribution of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis (DAGL alpha) and the degradation (MAGL) of 2-AG was determined for every retinal cell type from birth to adulthood. Our results indicate that DAGL alpha is present early in postnatal development. It is highly expressed in photoreceptor, horizontal, amacrine, and ganglion cells. MAGL appears later during the development of the retina and its presence is limited to amacrine and Muller cells. Overall, these results suggest that 2-AG is strongly present in early retinal development and might be involved in the regulation of the structural and functional maturation of the retina.

We identified an ECM-protective mutation in coiled-coil domain containing protein 88b (Ccdc88b), a poorly annotated gene that is found expressed specifically in spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and thymus. The CCDC88B protein is abundantly expressed in immune cells, including both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and in myeloid cells, and loss of CCDC88B protein expression has pleiotropic effects on T lymphocyte functions, including impaired maturation in vivo, significantly reduced activation, reduced cell division as well as impaired cytokine production (IFN-gamma and TNF) in response to T cell receptor engagement, or to nonspecific stimuli in vitro, and during the course of P. berghei infection in vivo. This identifies CCDC88B as a novel and important regulator of T cell function. The human CCDC88B gene maps to the 11q13 locus that is associated with susceptibility to several inflammatory and auto-immune disorders. Our findings strongly suggest that CCDC88B is the morbid gene underlying the pleiotropic effect of the 11q13 locus on inflammation.

Core and region-enriched networks of behaviorally regulated genes and the singing genome	SCIENCE			English	Article							BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUIT; IMMEDIATE-EARLY GENE; FINCH SONG SYSTEM; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FOREBRAIN CIRCUIT; JUVENILE SONGBIRD; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; HUMAN SPEECH; EXPRESSION	Songbirds represent an important model organism for elucidating molecular mechanisms that link genes with complex behaviors, in part because they have discrete vocal learning circuits that have parallels with those that mediate human speech. We found that similar to 10% of the genes in the avian genome were regulated by singing, and we found a striking regional diversity of both basal and singing-induced programs in the four key song nuclei of the zebra finch, a vocal learning songbird. The region-enriched patterns were a result of distinct combinations of region-enriched transcription factors (TFs), their binding motifs, and presinging acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) enhancer activity in the regulatory regions of the associated genes. RNA interference manipulations validated the role of the calcium-response transcription factor (CaRF) in regulating genes preferentially expressed in specific song nuclei in response to singing. Thus, differential combinatorial binding of a small group of activity-regulated TFs and predefined epigenetic enhancer activity influences the anatomical diversity of behaviorally regulated gene networks.

Circadian Mechanisms of Food Anticipatory Rhythms in Rats Fed Once or Twice Daily: Clock Gene and Endocrine Correlates	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DORSOMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; BRAIN-AREAS; PHASE-SHIFT; 2 MEALS; EXPRESSION; MICE; OSCILLATORS; ENTRAINMENT; SYSTEM	Circadian clocks in many brain regions and peripheral tissues are entrained by the daily rhythm of food intake. Clocks in one or more of these locations generate a daily rhythm of locomotor activity that anticipates a regular mealtime. Rats and mice can also anticipate two daily meals. Whether this involves 1 or 2 circadian clocks is unknown. To gain insight into how the circadian system adjusts to 2 daily mealtimes, male rats in a 12:12 light-dark cycle were fed a 2 h meal either 4 h after lights-on or 4 h after lights-off, or a 1 h meal at both times. After 30 days, brain, blood, adrenal and stomach tissue were collected at 6 time points. Multiple clock genes from adrenals and stomachs were assayed by RT-PCR. Blood was assayed for corticosterone and ghrelin. Bmal1 expression was quantified in 14 brain regions by in situ hybridization. Clock gene rhythms in adrenal and stomach from day-fed rats oscillated in antiphase with the rhythms in night-fed rats, and at an intermediate phase in rats fed twice daily. Corticosterone and ghrelin in 1-meal rats peaked at or prior to the expected mealtime. In 2-meal rats, corticosterone peaked only prior the nighttime meal, while ghrelin peaked prior to the daytime meal and then remained elevated. The olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, dorsal striatum, cerebellum and arcuate nucleus exhibited significant daily rhythms of Bmal1 in the night-fed groups that were approximately in antiphase in the day-fed groups, and at intermediate levels (arrhythmic) in rats anticipating 2 daily meals. The dissociations between anticipatory activity and the peripheral clocks and hormones in rats anticipating 2 daily meals argue against a role for these signals in the timing of behavioral rhythms. The absence of rhythmicity at the tissue level in brain regions from rats anticipating 2 daily meals support behavioral evidence that circadian clock cells in these tissues may reorganize into two populations coupled to different meals.

Mutations in Fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation 1 gene) engender exaggerated translation resulting in dendritic spine dysmorphogenesis, synaptic plasticity alterations, and behavioral deficits in mice, which are reminiscent of FXS phenotypes. Using postmortem brains from FXS patients and Fmr1 knockout mice (Fmr1(-/y)), we show that phosphorylation of the mRNA 5' cap binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), is elevated concomitant with increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) protein. Genetic or pharmacological reduction of eIF4E phosphorylation rescued core behavioral deficits, synaptic plasticity alterations, and dendritic spine morphology defects via reducing exaggerated translation of Mmp9 mRNA in Fmr1(-/y) mice, whereas MMP-9 overexpression produced several FXS-like phenotypes. These results uncover a mechanism of regulation of synaptic function by translational control of Mmp-9 in FXS, which opens the possibility of new treatment avenues for the diverse neurological and psychiatric aspects of FXS.

Recent evidence indicates marked chronic alterations in the functional organization of lesional tissue and large-scale cortico-subcortical networks. In this review, we focus on recent methodological developments in functional MRI (fMRI) analysis techniques and their application to the two most common drug-resistant focal epilepsies, i.e., temporal lobe epilepsy related to mesial temporal sclerosis and extra-temporal lobe epilepsy related to focal cortical dysplasia. We put particular emphasis on methodological developments in the analysis of task free or "resting-state" fMRI to probe the integrity of intrinsic networks on a regional, inter-regional, and connectome-wide level. In temporal lobe epilepsy, these techniques have revealed disrupted connectivity of the ipsilateral mesiotemporal lobe, together with contralateral compensatory reorganization and striking reconfigurations of large-scale networks. In cortical dysplasia, initial observations indicate functional alterations in lesional, peri-lesional, and remote neocortical regions. While future research is needed to critically evaluate the reliability, sensitivity, and specificity, fMRI mapping promises to lend distinct biomarkers for diagnosis, presurgical planning, and outcome prediction.

ATLAS Collaboration	Comprehensive measurements of t-channel single top-quark production cross sections at root S=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; HADRON COLLIDERS; PAIR PRODUCTION; LHC; COLLISIONS	This article presents measurements of the t-channel single top-quark ((t) over bart) and top-antiquark (_ t) total production cross sections sdtq_ and sd _ tq_, their ratio Rt sdtq_= sd _ tq_, and a measurement of the inclusive production cross section sdtq _ _ tq_ in proton-proton collisions at ffiffiffi ps = 7 TeV at the LHC. Differential cross sections for the tq and _ tq processes are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the absolute value of the rapidity of t and _ t, respectively. The analyzed data set was recorded with the ATLAS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.59 fb-1. Selected events contain one charged lepton, large missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets. The cross sections are measured by performing a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the output distributions of neural networks. The resulting measurements are sdtq_ 46 = 1dstat_ = 6dsyst_ pb, sd _ tq_ = 23 +/- 1dstat_ = 3dsyst_ pb, Rt = 2.04 0.13dstat_ +/-=0.12dsyst_, and sdtq _ _ tq_ = 68 +/-= 2dstat_ = 8dsyst_ pb, consistent with the Standard Model expectation. The uncertainty on the measured cross sections is dominated by systematic uncertainties, while the uncertainty on Rt is mainly statistical. Using the ratio of sdtq _ _ tq_ to its theoretical prediction, and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation jVtbj = jVtsj; jVtdj, we determine jVtbj = 1.02 = 0.07.

Many of these mutations are localized in the conserved donor or acceptor splice sites, while few are found in the nearby nucleotides. Methods: In this study we tested several therapeutic approaches specifically designed for different splicing mutations depending on how the mutations affect mRNA processing. For three mutations that affect the donor site (c.234 + 1G > A, c.633 + 1G > A and c.1542 + 4dupA), different modified U1 snRNAs recognizing the mutated donor sites, have been developed in an attempt to rescue the normal splicing process. For another mutation that affects an acceptor splice site (c.372-2A > G) and gives rise to a protein lacking four amino acids, a competitive inhibitor of the HGSNAT protein, glucosamine, was tested as a pharmacological chaperone to correct the aberrant folding and to restore the normal trafficking of the protein to the lysosome. Results: Partial correction of c.234 + 1G > A mutation was achieved with a modified U1 snRNA that completely matches the splice donor site suggesting that these molecules may have a therapeutic potential for some splicing mutations. Furthermore, the importance of the splice site sequence context is highlighted as a key factor in the success of this type of therapy. Additionally, glucosamine treatment resulted in an increase in the enzymatic activity, indicating a partial recovery of the correct folding. Conclusions: We have assayed two therapeutic strategies for different splicing mutations with promising results for the future applications.

Previous work on ASTM showed that the amplitude of the SAN increased in negativity as the number of maintained items increases. The aim of the current study was to measure the SAN and observe its behavior beyond the point of saturation of auditory short-term memory. We used atonal pure tones in sequences of 2, 4, 6, or 8 t. Our results showed that the amplitude of SAN increased in negativity from 2 to 4 items and then levelled off from 4 to 8 items. Behavioral results suggested that the average span in the task was slightly below 3, which was consistent with the observed plateau in the electrophysiological results. Furthermore, the amplitude of the SAN predicted individual differences in auditory memory capacity. The results support the hypothesis that the SAN is an electrophysiological index of brain activity specifically related to the maintenance of auditory information in ASTM. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Macrophage Infection via Selective Capture of HIV-1-Infected CD4(+) T Cells	CELL HOST & MICROBE			English	Article							IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1; MONOCYTE-DERIVED MACROPHAGES; VIROLOGICAL SYNAPSES; HIV-1 INFECTION; TRANSMISSION; SPREAD; SIV; TRANSMITTED/FOUNDER; ENTRY; REPLICATION	Macrophages contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis by forming a viral reservoir and mediating neurological disorders. Cell-free HIV-1 infection of macrophages is inefficient, in part due to low plasma membrane expression of viral entry receptors. We find that macrophages selectively capture and engulf HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells leading to efficient macrophage infection. Infected T cells, both healthy and dead or dying, were taken up through viral envelope glycoprotein-receptor-independent interactions, implying a mechanism distinct from conventional virological synapse formation. Macrophages infected by this cell-to-cell route were highly permissive for both CCR5-using macrophage-tropic and otherwise weakly macrophage-tropic transmitted/founder viruses but restrictive for nonmacrophage-tropic CXCR4-using virus. These results have implications for establishment of the macrophage reservoir and HIV-1 dissemination in vivo.	[Baxter, Amy E.; Russell, Rebecca A.; Duncan, Christopher J.

J	Mullen, KT; Kim, YJ; Gheiratmand, M				Mullen, Kathy T.; Kim, Yeon Jin; Gheiratmand, Mina			Contrast normalization in colour vision: the effect of luminance contrast on colour contrast detection	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CROSS-ORIENTATION SUPPRESSION; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; DETECTION MECHANISMS; VISUAL-CORTEX; BINOCULAR SUMMATION; CORTICAL-NEURONS; MASKING; GAIN; FACILITATION	While contrast normalization is well known to occur in luminance vision between overlaid achromatic contrasts, and in colour vision between overlaid colour contrasts, it is unknown whether it transfers between colour and luminance contrast. Here we investigate whether contrast detection in colour vision can be normalized by achromatic contrast, or whether this is a selective process driven only by colour contrast. We use a method of cross-orientation masking, in which colour detection is masked by cross-oriented achromatic contrast, over a range of spatio-temporal frequencies (0.375-1.5 cpd, 2-8 Hz). We find that there is virtually no cross-masking of colour by achromatic contrast under monocular or binocular conditions for any of the spatio-temporal frequencies tested, although we find significant facilitation at low spatio-temporal conditions (0.375 cpd, 2 Hz). These results indicate that the process of contrast nornalization is colour selective and independent of achromatic contrast, and imply segregated chromatic signals in early visual processing. Under dichoptic conditions, however, we find a strikingly different result with significant masking of colour by achromatic contrast. This indicates that the dichoptic site of suppression is unselective, responding similarly to colour and luminance contrast, and suggests that dichoptic suppression has a different origin from monocular or binocular suppression.

Dysphagia and other oropharyngeal dysfunctions may be associated with CM I, but to our knowledge, no clinical presentation similar to ours has ever been reported. The purpose of this communication is to draw attention to a unique and atypical clinical presentation of a child with CM I. Case presentation: A 7-year-old boy was evaluated for a two month history of atypical movements which would occur in the evening, and last for an hour after eating. These stereotypical movements with the head and chest bending forward and to the left side, accompanied by a grimace, were associated with sensation of breath locking without cyanosis. Pain and dysphagia were absent. The neurological examination was normal. The possibility of Sandifer syndrome posturing occurring with gastroesopageal reflux disease was considered but neither pain nor back hyperextension were associated with the atypical movements. Neither proton pump inhibitors (PPI) nor prokinetic agents improved his symptoms. Upper endoscopy and esophageal biopsy did not reveal eosinophilic esophagitis nor reflux esophagitis. Ear, throat and nose (ENT) exam was normal. A severe gastroparesis was demonstrated on milk scan study. Two 24 hour oesophageal pH probe studies pointed out severe gastroesophageal reflux (GER). High resolution manometric evaluation of the oesophagus revealed normal sphincter pressures and relaxations with no dysmotility of the esophageal body. Electroencephalography and polysomnography were normal. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and revealed a CM I: cerebellar tonsils extending to 12 mm, with syringomyelia (D4-D5). For a long period of time, the child's abnormal movements were considered to be nothing but tics and the CM I a fortuitous finding. Since the child remained symptomatic despite medical treatment, it was decided to proceed with surgery. One year after the onset of his symptoms, he underwent posterior fossa decompression with upper cervical laminectomy and expansion duroplasty. Postoperative MRI confirmed adequate decompression. His atypical posture and dyspnea completely resolved after surgery and he remains asymptomatic two years later. Conclusion: Children may have atypical presentations of CM I. Thus, CM I diagnosis should be considered in unexplained atypical oropharyngeal dysfunctions.

Therefore, identifying key clusters of comorbidity and exploring the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms represent important steps toward improving mental health care. In the present review, we focus on the frequent association between addiction and depression. In particular, we summarize the large body of evidence from preclinical models indicating that the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), a member of the opioid neuromodulatory system, represents a central player in the regulation of both reward and mood processes. Current data suggest that the KOR modulates overlapping neuronal networks linking brainstem monoaminergic nuclei with forebrain limbic structures. Rewarding properties of both drugs of abuse and natural stimuli, as well as the neurobiological effects of stressful experiences, strongly interact at the level of KOR signaling. In addiction models, activity of the KOR is potentiated by stressors and critically controls drug-seeking and relapse. In depression paradigms, KOR signaling is responsive to a variety of stressors, and mediates despair-like responses. Altogether, the KOR represents a prototypical substrate of comorbidity, whereby life experiences converge upon common brain mechanisms to trigger behavioral dysregulation and increased risk for distinct but interacting psychopathologies.

EPILEPTIFORM SYNCHRONIZATION AND HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS IN BRAIN SLICES COMPRISING PIRIFORM AND ENTORHINAL CORTICES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						4-aminopyridine; entorhinal cortex; epilepsy; high-frequency oscillations; piriform cortex	GUINEA-PIG BRAIN; CORTEX IN-VITRO; ICTAL ACTIVITY; PATTERNS; RAT; 4-AMINOPYRIDINE; DISCHARGES; NETWORKS; ONSET; HIPPOCAMPUS	We employed field potential recordings in extended in vitro brain slices form Sprague-Dawley rats containing the piriform and entorhinal cortices (PC and EC, respectively) to identify the characteristics of epileptiform discharges and concomitant high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, ripples: 80-200 Hz, fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) during bath application of 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 mu M). Ictal-like discharges occurred in PC and EC either synchronously or independently of each other; synchronous ictal discharges always emerged from a synchronous "fast" interictal background whereas asynchronous ictal discharges were preceded by a "slow" interictal event. In addition, asynchronous ictal discharges had longer duration and interval of occurrence than synchronous ictal discharges, and contained a higher proportion of ripples and fast ripples. Cutting the connections between PC and EC made synchronicity disappear and increased ictal discharges duration in the EC but failed in changing HFO occurrence in both areas. Finally, antagonizing ionotropic glutamatergic receptors abolished ictal activity in all experiments, increased the duration and rate of occurrence of interictal discharges occurring in PC-EC interconnected slices while it did not influence the slow asynchronous interictal discharges in both areas. Our results identify some novel in vitro interactions between olfactory (PC) and limbic (EC) structures that presumably contribute to in vivo ictogenesis as well. (C) 2014 IBRO.

Cardiothoracic Surg Trials Network	Surgical Treatment of Moderate Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; HEART-FAILURE; THORACIC SURGEONS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; SURVIVAL; REVASCULARIZATION; ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; ASSOCIATION; DETERMINANT; MECHANISM	BACKGROUND Ischemic mitral regurgitation is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. For surgical patients with moderate regurgitation, the benefits of adding mitralvalve repair to coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) are uncertain. METHODS We randomly assigned 301 patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation to CABG alone or CABG plus mitral-valve repair (combined procedure). The primary end point was the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI), a measure of left ventricular remodeling, at 1 year. This end point was assessed with the use of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in which deaths were categorized as the lowest LVESVI rank. RESULTS At 1 year, the mean LVESVI among surviving patients was 46.1+/-22.4 ml per square meter of body-surface area in the CABG-alone group and 49.6+/-31.5 ml per square meter in the combined-procedure group (mean change from baseline, -9.4 and -9.3 ml per square meter, respectively). The rate of death was 6.7% in the combined-procedure group and 7.3% in the CABG-alone group (hazard ratio with mitral-valve repair, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.38 to 2.12; P = 0.81). The rank-based assessment of LVESVI at 1 year (incorporating deaths) showed no significant between-group difference (z score, 0.50; P = 0.61). The addition of mitral-valve repair was associated with a longer bypass time (P<0.001), a longer hospital stay after surgery (P = 0.002), and more neurologic events (P = 0.03). Moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was less common in the combined-procedure group than in the CABG-alone group (11.2% vs. 31.0%, P<0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, deaths, readmissions, functional status, or quality of life at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS In patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, the addition of mitral-valve repair to CABG did not result in a higher degree of left ventricular reverse remodeling. Mitral-valve repair was associated with a reduced prevalence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation but an increased number of untoward events. Thus, at 1 year, this trial did not show a clinically meaningful advantage of adding mitral-valve repair to CABG. Longer-term follow-up may determine whether the lower prevalence of mitral regurgitation translates into a net clinical benefit.	[Smith, P.

Inflammation-Induced Tumorigenesis in Mouse Colon Is Caspase-6 Independent	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL-CELLS; AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AXON DEGENERATION; SELF-ACTIVATION; HUMAN NEURONS; CANCER CELLS; LAMIN-A; APOPTOSIS; CLEAVAGE	Caspases play an important role in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Active Caspase-6 (Casp6) is considered a novel therapeutic target against Alzheimer disease (AD) since it is present in AD pathological brain lesions, associated with age-dependent cognitive decline, and causes age-dependent cognitive impairment in the mouse brain. However, active Casp6 is highly expressed and activated in normal human colon epithelial cells raising concerns that inhibiting Casp6 in AD may promote colon carcinogenesis. Furthermore, others have reported rare mutations of Casp6 in human colorectal cancers and an effect of Casp6 on apoptosis and metastasis of colon cancer cell lines. Here, we investigated the role of Casp6 in inflammation-associated azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) colon cancer in Casp6-overexpressing and -deficient mice. In wild-type mice, AOM/DSS-induced tumors had significantly higher Casp6 mRNA, protein and activity levels compared to normal adjacent colon tissues. Increased human Casp6 or absence of Casp6 expression in mice colon epithelial cells did not change colonic tumor multiplicity, burden or distribution. Nevertheless, the incidence of hyperplasia was slightly reduced in human Casp6-overexpressing colons and increased in Casp6 null colons. Overexpression of Casp6 did not affect the grade of the tumors while all tumors in heterozygous or homozygous Casp6 null colons were high grade compared to only 50% high grade in wild-type mice. Casp6 levels did not alter cellular proliferation and apoptosis. These results suggest that Casp6 is unlikely to be involved in colitis-associated tumors.

Deficits in social behaviour and cognition are amongst the most pervasive outcomes of prenatal ethanol exposure. Our naturalistic vervet monkey model of fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) provides an unparalleled opportunity to study the neurobehavioral outcomes of prenatal ethanol exposure in a controlled experimental setting. Recent work has revealed a significant reduction of the neuronal population in the frontal lobes of these monkeys. We used an intersensory matching procedure to investigate audiovisual perception of socially relevant stimuli in young FAE vervet monkeys. Here we show a domain-specific deficit in audiovisual integration of socially relevant stimuli. When FAE monkeys were shown a pair of side-by-side videos of a monkey concurrently presenting two different calls along with a single audio track matching the content of one of the calls, they were not able to match the correct video to the single audio track. This was manifest by their average looking time being equally spent towards both the matching and non-matching videos. However, a group of normally developing monkeys exhibited a significant preference for the non-matching video. This inability to integrate and thereby discriminate audiovisual stimuli was confined to the integration of faces and voices as revealed by the monkeys' ability to match a dynamic face to a complex tone or a black-and-white checkerboard to a pure tone, presumably based on duration and/or onset-offset synchrony. Together, these results suggest that prenatal ethanol exposure negatively affects a specific domain of audiovisual integration. This deficit is confined to the integration of information that is presented by the face and the voice and does not affect more elementary aspects of sensory integration.

Here, in parallel auditory experiments with older rats and humans, we evaluated a targeted cognitive training approach that adaptively manipulated distractor challenge. Training resulted in enhanced discrimination abilities in the setting of irrelevant information in both species that was driven by selectively diminished distraction-related errors. Neural responses to distractors in auditory cortex were selectively reduced in both species, mimicking the behavioral effects. Sensory receptive fields in trained rats exhibited improved spectral and spatial selectivity. Frontal theta measures of top-down engagement with distractors were selectively restrained in trained humans. Finally, training gains generalized to group and individual level benefits in aspects of working memory and sustained attention. Thus, we demonstrate converging cross-species evidence for training-induced selective plasticity of distractor processing at multiple neural scales, benefitting distractor suppression and cognitive control.

In the neocortex, the dendrites of pyramidal neurons are covered by thousands of tiny protrusions known as dendrite spines, which are the major recipient sites for excitatory synaptic information in the brain. Their peculiar morphology, with a small head connected to the dendritic shaft by a slender neck, has inspired decades of theoretical and more recently experimental work in an attempt to understand how excitatory synaptic inputs are processed, stored and integrated in pyramidal neurons. Advances in electrophysiological, optical and genetic tools are now enabling us to unravel the biophysical and molecular mechanisms controlling spine function in health and disease. Here I highlight relevant findings, challenges and hypotheses on spine function, with an emphasis on the electrical properties of spines and on how these affect the storage and integration of excitatory synaptic inputs in pyramidal neurons. In an attempt to make sense of the published data, I propose that the raison d'etre for dendritic spines lies in their ability to undergo activity-dependent structural and molecular changes that can modify synaptic strength, and hence alter the gain of the linearly integrated sub-threshold depolarizations in pyramidal neuron dendrites before the generation of a dendritic spike.

Methods: Whole brain and regional volumes of 36 patients with relapsing-remitting MS onset prior to 18 years of age were segmented in 185 longitudinal MRI scans (2-11 scans per participant, 3-month to 2-year scan intervals). MRI scans of 25 age-and sex-matched healthy normal controls (NC) were also acquired at baseline and 2 years later on the same scanner as the MS group. A total of 874 scans from 339 participants from the NIH-funded MRI study of normal brain development acquired at 2-year intervals were used as an age-expected healthy growth reference. All data were analyzed with an automatic image processing pipeline to estimate the volume of brain and brain substructures. Mixed-effect models were built using age, sex, and group as fixed effects. Results: Significant group and age interactions were found with the adjusted models fitting brain volumes and normalized thalamus volumes (p<10(-4)). These findings indicate a failure of age-normative brain growth for the MS group, and an even greater failure of thalamic growth. In patients with MS, T2 lesion volume correlated with a greater reduction in age-expected thalamic volume. To exclude any scanner-related influence on our data, we confirmed no significant interaction of group in the adjusted models between the NC and NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development groups. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that the onset of MS during childhood and adolescence limits age-expected primary brain growth and leads to subsequent brain atrophy, implicating an early onset of the neurodegenerative aspect of MS.

A crucial question is whether such early representations are maintained in the brain over time without continued input. Using functional MRI, we show that internationally adopted (IA) children from China, exposed exclusively to French since adoption (mean age of adoption, 12.8 mo), maintained neural representations of their birth language despite functionally losing that language and having no conscious recollection of it. Their neural patterns during a Chinese lexical tone discrimination task matched those observed in Chinese/French bilinguals who have had continual exposure to Chinese since birth and differed from monolingual French speakers who had never been exposed to Chinese. They processed lexical tone as linguistically relevant, despite having no Chinese exposure for 12.6 y, on average, and no conscious recollection of that language. More specifically, IA participants recruited left superior temporal gyrus/planum temporale, matching the pattern observed in Chinese/French bilinguals. In contrast, French speakers who had never been exposed to Chinese did not recruit this region and instead activated right superior temporal gyrus.

Understanding the role of adjunctive nonpharmacological therapies in management of the multiple pathways to depression	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Review						Metabolic syndrome; Adjunct therapy; Somatic therapies; Psychotherapy; Major depressive disorder	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NONSEASONAL MAJOR DEPRESSION; ST JOHNS WORT; COMORBIDITY SURVEY REPLICATION; SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; CANMAT CLINICAL GUIDELINES; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; METABOLIC SYNDROME; COGNITIVE THERAPY; OLDER-ADULTS	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2% and the fourth highest cause of disability globally. It is hypothesized to be a syndromatic manifestation of multiple pathological processes leading to similar clinical manifestation. MDD is associated with at least three categories of peripheral hormone-type factors including neurotrophic factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and processes that impair regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Neuroimaging studies have identified functional abnormalities including subcortical systems associated with reward and emotion processing, medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions and the lateral prefrontal cortical systems involved in cognitive control and voluntary emotion regulation. Studies investigating the effects of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy on functional brain measures show normalization of brain function with return to euthymia. Nevertheless, approximately 50% of patients with MDD will not respond sufficiently and 60 to 70% will not achieve full remission with first-line pharmacotherapy, therefore clinicians strive to improve patient responses through the use of adjunct therapies. This review discusses recent research in the various biological processes associated with MDD as well as recent data in support of the use of adjunctive non-pharmacological therapies including psychotherapy, bibliotherapy, Internet therapy, "natural" or herbal approaches, exercise therapy, and somatic therapies.

The aim of this study was to understand neuropsychological component of the suicidal crisis in Alzheimer's disease. Method. - Using an extensive neuropsychological battery, different aspects of cognitive inhibition were particularly examined: Access to relevant information (using the Reading with distraction task), suppression of no longer relevant information (Trail Making Test, Rule Shift Cards), and restraint of cognitive resources to relevant information (Stroop test, Hayling Sentence Completion test, Go/No-Go). One female Alzheimer depressed case was assessed before and after a suicide attempt. Results. - Ten days after the patient's suicide attempt, dementia was still moderate with a MMSE score at 21/30 but with a worsening of executive functions (FAB at 8/18) in the context of depression and suicide. The Hamilton-Depression Rating Scale was at 24 (maximal score at 52), and the Cornell Scale for Depression was at 21 (maximal score at 38). Suicidal intent was moderate with a score of 9 on the Beck Suicide Intent Scale (maximal score at 25). The patient did not present a delirium, psychotic symptoms, or anosognosia. Her episodic memory was altered as shown by her semantic performance on verbal fluency (naming 12 animals in 120 seconds) and on lexical fluency (naming 8 words beginning with the letter P). Initially preserved, executive function declined during a suicidal crisis in a context of depression in Alzheimer's disease case. Neuropsychological testing confirmed a dysexecutive syndrome (FAS at 8/18), with an impairment in her conceptualization capacity (MCST) and a deficit in cognitive inhibition and its access (reading task in the presence of distractors), deletion (TMT) and restraint (Stroop, Go/No-Go, Hayling) functions. Computed tomography has shown no signs of intracranial expansive process. Conclusion. - Assessing predictors of suicide and means of completion in patients with dementia may help the development of interventions to reduce risk of suicide among the growing population of individuals with dementia. Because of Alzheimer's-related cognitive inhibition impairment, identification and intervention addressing the complex issues of depression, executive dysfunction and dementia may help clinicians to mitigate the risk of suicide in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Clinical presentation of Moroccan cases with Alzheimer's disease	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Moroccan cases; Atrophy; MMSE; Neuropsychological performances	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DEMENTIA; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; SYMPTOMS; ATROPHY; SCALE	Introduction. -The diagnostic approach for Alzheimer's disease is based on the presence of cerebral atrophy combined with the score of the mini-examination of the mental state. In this context, this study was conducted to assess the correlation between imaging and neuropsychological testing for cases of early-onset and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Aim of the study. -Analysis of the clinical and paraclinical aspects of Moroccan cases with Alzheimer's disease. Methods. -Seventeen sporadic cases and 8 family cases were seen at the memory clinic of the Neurology Department of the University of Casablanca Ibn Rochd Hospital. A family history was obtained through a clinical interview of the patient and a yes or no self-reporting questionnaire from the guardian or other family member. The disease was considered familial if at least one additional first degree relative suffered from early-onset AD-type dementia. All patients underwent standard somatic neurological examination, cognitive function assessment, brain imaging and laboratory tests. Written consent was obtained from the patients and their guardians prior to the study. Results. -In our study of 25 individuals, the observed mean age of AD patients was 64.52 +/- 9.30 and we observed a slight female predominance (56% versus 44%). In addition, we found a prevalence of AD of approximately 20%, increasing with age, in the population below 60 years of age. Approximately half of our patients (48%) had a score lower than 10 and were affected by severe insanity, while 28% were affected by moderate severe insanity and 24% were light to moderately insane. Twenty-five patients underwent neuroimaging, 18 of whom were assessed by MRI, while 7 were assessed by CT. All patients had hippocampal atrophy, which progressed to affect others brain regions. The blood tests showed no abnormalities in the 25 enrolled AD cases. Discussion. -Age is undoubtedly the main risk factor for AD; this is also the true for our cases where advanced age was responsible for the exponential increase of the disease's frequency; it reached a peak in the age group of 60-69 years. The AD diagnosis approach is based on the presence of cerebral atrophy combined with the score of the mini-examination of the mental state (MMSE). In our study, in addition to the MMSE, depending on the level of education, the clinician used other tests that do not necessarily require a Level of education such as the BEC96, visual short-term or digital memory assessment, work memory assessment, language assessment test (DO80) and apraxia. Neuropsychological examination of the cases with a score of less than 10 showed severe cognitive impairment. The cases presented memory and language impairments, aphasia, visual spatial disorientation, decreased autonomy, executive dysfunction and praxis deficits, all major causes of severe dementia. Neuroimaging revealed hippocannpal and cortical atrophy. Correlated with the other studies that aimed to establish links between brain alterations and neuropsychological disorders, we can conclude that a higher level of atrophy reflects a decrease in neuropsychological performance.

Methods: Nine chinchillas received intratympanic injection of 3% tea tree oil dissolved in olive oil in one ear, whereas the contralateral control ear received olive oil only. Outcome measures included auditory brainstem responses conducted before treatment and at 10 days and 30 days following the injection. Post-mortem cochlear morphology was assessed using scanning electron microscopy. Results: At 10 and 30 days following the injection, there was no significant change in auditory brain response thresholds at 8, 16,20 or 25 kHz. Scanning electron microscopy imaging showed no damage to auditory hair cells. Conclusion: Tea tree oil (3%) does not appear to be ototoxic in a chinchilla animal model. Future preclinical and clinical studies are required to establish the effectiveness of TTO in treating otitis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods. - A questionnaire regarding 25 clinical cases was presented via visual projection, to attendees of the Congres de la Societe francaise de neurochirurgie et de la Societe de langue francaise de neurochirurgie held in Toulouse from May 9th to May 12th, 2012. The audience (n = 59) consisted of 58 neurosurgeons and one neuroradiologist. A minority of them (29.2%) stated that they specialized in vascular neurosurgery. The questionnaire dealt with 25 illustrative clinical cases, in which age, gender, and clinical context were provided along with the corresponding angiographic image of the aneurysm. The questionnaire asked whether the physician would have proposed treatment, and if so, which type of treatment (clip, coil or other). In addition, the physician had to indicate, on a scale of one to ten, the degree of confidence they had in their decision. Results. - For one-third of the cases, there was at least 10% of the respondents who opted for a decision opposite to the one of the majority. For 41.7% of the cases, the proportion of respondents who opted for the clip was not significantly different from the proportion of those who opted for the coil. Conclusion. - Even in a relatively homogenous group of physicians, there were significantly diverging opinions regarding the management of cerebral aneurysms. This demonstrates the need for evidence-based data from controlled randomized studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Less explored is the influence of obesity on learning and memory. In the current study we assessed stimulus reward association learning, explicit learning and memory and working memory in healthy weight, overweight and obese individuals. Explicit learning and memory did not differ as a function of group. In contrast, working memory was significantly and similarly impaired in both overweight and obese individuals compared to the healthy weight group. In the first reward association learning task the obese, but not healthy weight or overweight participants consistently formed paradoxical preferences for a pattern associated with a negative outcome (fewer food rewards). To determine if the deficit was specific to food reward a second experiment was conducted using money. Consistent with Experiment 1, obese individuals selected the pattern associated with a negative outcome (fewer monetary rewards) more frequently than healthy weight individuals and thus failed to develop a significant preference for the most rewarded patterns as was observed in the healthy weight group. Finally, on a probabilistic learning task, obese compared to healthy weight individuals showed deficits in negative, but not positive outcome learning. Taken together, our results demonstrate deficits in working memory and stimulus reward learning in obesity and suggest that obese individuals are impaired in learning to avoid negative outcomes.

Two main orientations are suggested by recent studies: inflammation of the vessel wall and analysis of physical constraints of blood flow using 4D flow imaging (shear parietal). This paper will focus on radiological application of 4D flow imaging and inflammation imaging, in the characterization of potential prognostic markers of CNS vascular disorders. We will review the basic technical considerations of 4D flow MRA, inflammation imaging and discuss their applications in CNS vascular disorders: aneurysms, arteriovenous malformation, dural arteriovenous fistulas. We will illustrate their potential in the development of individual rupture risk criteria in brain vascular disorders. (C) 2014 Editions francaises de radiologie. All rights reserved.

Management strategies have been proposed that would slow the rise of resistance, however testing these strategies has been hampered by the lack of identified strong-effect resistance markers in parasites. We show that the Caenorhabditis elegans gene Cel_dyf-7, necessary for amphid sensory neuron development, also confers macrocyclic lactone sensitivity. In the sheep parasite Haemonchus contortus: (i) strains selected for macrocyclic lactone resistance were enriched in, a Hco_dyf-7 haplotype that was rare in the drug-naive population, (ii) the resistant haplotype correlated with the sensory neuron defects, and (iii) the resistant haplotype was associated with decreased Hco_dyf-7 expression. Resistant field isolates of H. contortus from five continents were enriched for the resistant haplotype, demonstrating the relevance of the Hco_dyf-7 haplotype to practise and indicating that it is a locus of strong effect. Hemizygosity resulting from sex linkage of dyf-7 likely contributes to the rise of resistance in treated populations. (C) 2014 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Metabolism as a tool for understanding human brain evolution: Lipid energy metabolism as an example	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION			English	Article						Triglycerides; Fatty acids; Ketone bodies; Brain evolution; Thrifty genotype; Inuit; Carnitine palmitoyl transferase	ACETOACETYL-COA SYNTHETASE; KETONE-BODY UTILIZATION; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; SUCKLING RAT; NATURAL-SELECTION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; KETOGENIC DIET; MESSENGER-RNA; MITOCHONDRIAL; DEFICIENCY	Genes and the environment both influence the metabolic processes that determine fitness. To illustrate the importance of metabolism for human brain evolution and health, we use the example of lipid energy metabolism, i.e. the use of fat (lipid) to produce energy and the advantages that this metabolic pathway provides for the brain during environmental energy shortage. We briefly describe some features of metabolism in ancestral organisms, which provided a molecular toolkit for later development. In modern humans, lipid energy metabolism is a regulated multi-organ pathway that links triglycerides in fat tissue to the mitochondria of many tissues including the brain. Three important control points are each suppressed by insulin. (1) Lipid reserves in adipose tissue are released by lipolysis during fasting and stress, producing fatty acids (FAs) which circulate in the blood and are taken up by cells. (2) FA oxidation. Mitochondrial entry is controlled by carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Inside the mitochondria, FAs undergo beta oxidation and energy production in the Krebs cycle and respiratory chain. (3) In liver mitochondria, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) pathway produces ketone bodies for the brain and other organs. Unlike most tissues, the brain does not capture and metabolize circulating FAs for energy production. However, the brain can use ketone bodies for energy. We discuss two examples of genetic metabolic traits that may be advantageous under most conditions but deleterious in others. (1) A CPT1A variant prevalent in Inuit people may allow increased FA oxidation under nonfasting conditions but also predispose to hypoglycemic episodes. (2) The thrifty genotype theory, which holds that energy expenditure is efficient so as to maximize energy stores, predicts that these adaptations may enhance survival in periods of famine but predispose to obesity in modern dietary environments.

Large arteriolar component of oxygen delivery implies a safe margin of oxygen supply to cerebral tissue	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							BLOOD-FLOW; VASCULAR NETWORK; CAPILLARIES; TRANSPORT; VESSELS; BRAIN; TENSION; CORTEX; MICROCIRCULATION; METABOLISM	What is the organization of cerebral microvascular oxygenation and morphology that allows adequate tissue oxygenation at different activity levels? We address this question in the mouse cerebral cortex using microscopic imaging of intravascular O-2 partial pressure and blood flow combined with numerical modelling. Here we show that parenchymal arterioles are responsible for 50% of the extracted O-2 at baseline activity, and the majority of the remaining O-2 exchange takes place within the first few capillary branches. Most capillaries release little O-2 at baseline acting as an O-2 reserve that is recruited during increased neuronal activity or decreased blood flow. Our results challenge the common perception that capillaries are the major site of O-2 delivery to cerebral tissue. The understanding of oxygenation distribution along arterio-capillary paths may have profound implications for the interpretation of blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging and for evaluating microvascular O-2 delivery capacity to support cerebral tissue in disease.

Aerial Application of Mancozeb and Urinary Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) Concentrations among Pregnant Women in Costa Rica: The Infants' Environmental Health Study (ISA)	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article							ETHYLENEBIS(DITHIOCARBAMATE) EBDC FUNGICIDES; QUADRUPOLE MASS-SPECTROMETRY; SEMI-LOGARITHMIC EQUATIONS; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; THYROID-HORMONES; REFERENCE VALUES; DUMMY VARIABLES; DIFFERENT AREAS; EXPOSURE; EXCRETION	function; thyroid hormones are essential for fetal brain development. In Costa Rica, mancozeb is aerially sprayed at large-scale banana plantations on a weekly basis. Objectives: Our goals were to evaluate urinary ETU concentrations in pregnant women living near large-scale banana plantations, compare their estimated daily intake (EDI) with established reference doses (RfDs), and identify factors that predict their urinary ETU concentrations. Methods: We enrolled 451 pregnant women from Matina County, Costa Rica, which has large-scale banana production. We visited 445 women up to three times during pregnancy to obtain urine samples (n = 872) and information on factors that possibly influence exposure. We determined urinary ETU concentrations using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: Pregnant women's median urinary ETU concentrations were more than five times higher than those reported for other general populations. Seventy-two percent of the women had EDIs above the RfD. Women who lived closest (1st quartile, < 48 m) to banana plantations on average had a 45% (95% CI: 23, 72%) higher urinary ETU compared with women who lived farthest away (4th quartile, = 565 m). Compared with the other women, ETU was also higher in women who washed agricultural work clothes on the day before sampling (11%; 95% CI: 4.9, 17%), women who worked in agriculture during pregnancy (19%; 95% CI: 9.3, 29%), and immigrant women (6.2%; 95% CI: 1.0, 13%). Conclusions: The pregnant women's urinary ETU concentrations are of concern, and the principal source of exposure is likely to be aerial spraying of mancozeb. The factors predicting ETU provide insight into possibilities for exposure reduction.

Neurobehavioral Function in School-Age Children Exposed to Manganese in Drinking Water	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article							TRACE-ELEMENTS; INTELLECTUAL FUNCTION; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; HAIR; DYSFUNCTION; BANGLADESH; HUMANS; MODELS; BLOOD; AIR	BACKGROUND: Manganese neurotoxicity is well documented in individuals occupationally exposed to airborne particulates, but few data are available on risks from drinking-water exposure. OBJECTIVE: We examined associations of exposure from concentrations of manganese in water and hair with memory, attention, motor function, and parent- and teacher-reported hyperactive behaviors. METHODS: We recruited 375 children and measured manganese in home tap water (MnW) and hair (MnH). We estimated manganese intake from water ingestion. Using structural equation modeling, we estimated associations between neuro-behavioral functions and MnH, MnW, and manganese intake from water. We evaluated exposure-response relationships using generalized additive models. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, a 1-SD increase in log(10) MnH was associated with a significant difference of -24% (95% CI: -36, -12%) SD in memory and -25% (95% CI: -41, -9%) SD in attention. The relations between log(10) MnH and poorer memory and attention were linear. A 1-SD increase in log(10) MnW was associated with a significant difference of -14% (95% CI: -24, -4%) SD in memory, and this relation was nonlinear, with a steeper decline in performance at MnW > 100 mu g/L. A 1-SD increase in log(10) manganese intake from water was associated with a significant difference of -11% (95% CI: -21, -0.4%) SD in motor function. The relation between log(10) manganese intake and poorer motor function was linear. There was no significant association between manganese exposure and hyperactivity. CONCLUSION: Exposure to manganese in water was associated with poorer neuro-behavioral performances in children, even at low levels commonly encountered in North America.

Data derived from canines subjected to long-term SCS [(group 1: studied after 3-4 weeks SCS; n = 5) (group 2: studied after 5 weeks SCS; n = 11)] were compared to data derived from 10 control animals (including 4 sham SCS electrode implantations). During terminal studies conducted under anesthesia, chronotropic and inotropic responses to vagal nerve or stellate ganglion stimulation were similar in all 3 groups. Chronic SCS suppressed atrial tachyarrhythmia induction evoked by mediastinal nerve stimulation. When induced, arrhythmia durations were shortened (controls: median of 27 s; SCS 3-4 weeks: median of 16 s; SCS 5 weeks: median of 7 s). Phasic and accommodating right atrial neuronal somata displayed similar passive and active membrane properties in vitro, whether derived from sham or either chronic SCS group. Synaptic efficacy was differentially enhanced in accommodating (not phasic) IC neurons by chronic SCS. Taken together these data indicate that chronic SCS therapy modifies IC neuronal stochastic inter-connectivity in atrial fibrillation suppression by altering synaptic function without directly targeting the transmembrane properties of individual IC neuronal somata.

Less well-understood is how the human hippocampus interacts with other brain regions to support pattern separation. The purpose of this study was to identify the functional networks connected to the hippocampus during delayed matching-to-sample pattern separation tasks promoting either spatial or temporal interference. Results revealed that the hippocampus was functionally connected to two distinct networks. The first network was characterized by correlated activation with the hippocampus primarily in bilateral temporal regions. This network was differentially related to spatial and temporal conditions, suggesting hippocampal connectivity to this network is modulated by interference type. A secondary network was characterized by correlations between the left hippocampus and several other sparsely distributed brain regions, including bilateral cerebellum and frontal and temporal cortices. This network was not modulated by interference type, suggesting that it may be a domain-general pattern separation network. We suggest that the hippocampus may play a role in integrating information from these networks to support performance on pattern separation tasks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Park, RM; Baldwin, M; Bouchard, MF; Mergler, D				Park, Robert M.; Baldwin, Mary; Bouchard, Maryse F.; Mergler, Donna			Airborne manganese as dust vs. fume determining blood levels in workers at a manganese alloy production plant	NEUROTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Manganese; Respiratory particle size; Half-life; Blood manganese; Manganese alloy production	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; PHARMACOKINETIC MODELS; OCCUPATIONAL-EXPOSURE; FERROALLOY PLANT; RISK-ASSESSMENT; FOLLOW-UP; NEUROTOXICITY; HUMANS; DYSFUNCTION	The appropriate exposure metrics for characterizing manganese (Mn) exposure associated with neurobehavioral effects have not been established. Blood levels of Mn (B-Mn) provide a potentially important intermediate marker of Mn airborne exposures. Using data from a study of a population of silicon- and ferro-manganese alloy production workers employed between 1973 and 1991, B-Mn levels were modeled in relation to prior Mn exposure using detailed work histories and estimated respirable Mn concentrations from air-sampling records. Despite wide variation in exposure levels estimated for individual jobs, duration of employment (exposure) was itself a strong predictor of B-Mn levels and strongest when an 80-day half-life was applied to contributions over time (t = 6.95, 7.44, respectively; p < 10(-5)). Partitioning exposure concentrations based on process origin into two categories: (1) "large" respirable particulate (Mn-LRP) derived mainly from mechanically generated dust, and (2) "small" respirable particulate (Mn-SRP) primarily electric furnace condensation fume, revealed that B-Mn levels largely track the small, fume exposures. With a half-life of 65 days applied in a model with cumulative exposure terms for both Mn-LRP (t = -0.16, p = 0.87) and Mn-SRP (t = 6.45, p < 10(-5)), the contribution of the large-size fraction contribution was negligible. Constructing metrics based on the square root of SRP exposure concentrations produced a better model fit (t = 7.87 vs. 7.44, R-2 = 0.2333 vs. 0.2157). In a model containing both duration (t = 0.79, p = 0.43) and (square root) fume (t = 2.47, p = 0.01) metrics, the duration term was a weak contributor. Furnace-derived, small respirable Mn particulate appears to be the primary contributor to B-Mn levels, with a dose-rate dependence in a population chronically exposed to Mn, with air-concentrations declining in recent years. These observations may reflect the presence of homeostatic control of Mn levels in the blood and other body tissues and be useful in assessing Mn exposures for evaluating neurotoxic effects.

Here, we further investigate the findings on exposure and neurobehavioral outcomes of workers from a silico- and ferromanganese production plant and non-exposed workers from the same community in 1990 and 2004, using a variety of exposure metrics that distinguish particle size and origin within the range of respirable airborne exposures. Mn exposure matrices for large respirable particulate (Mn-LRP, dust) and small respirable particulate (Mn-SRP, fume), based on process origins, were used together with detailed work histories since 1973 (plant opening), to construct exposure metrics including burdens and cumulative burdens with various clearance half-lives. For three out of eight 1990 neurobehavioral tests analyzed with linear regression models, duration of Mn exposure was the best predictor: Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery - Motor Scale, Trail-Making B and Finger Tapping. The Luria-Nebraska Motor Scale had the strongest association (t similar to 5.0, p < 10(-6)). For outcomes on three other tests, the duration and Mn-SRP metrics were comparable: Trail Making Test A, Cancellation H and Stroop Color-Word Test (color/word subtest). Delayed Word Recall was best predicted by Mn-SRP (based on square root or truncated air-concentrations). The Word score on the Stroop Color-Word Test was the only outcome for which Mn-LRP was the leading predictor (t = -2.92, p = 0.003), while performance on the WAIS-R Digit Span Test was not significantly predicted by any metric. For outcomes evaluated in both 1990 and 2004, a mixed-effect linear regression model was used to examine estimates of within-individual trends. Duration and Mn-SRP were associated with performance on the Luria-Nebraska Motor Scale, as well as with other outcomes that appeared to have both reversible and progressive features, including Trail Making A and B, Cancellation H and Delayed Word Recall. With the mixed-effect model, Digit Span exhibited a significant irreversible association with exposure duration (t = -2.34, p = 0.021) and Mn-SRP (square root; t = -2.38, p = 0.019) metrics. The strong prediction using duration of exposure is consistent with effective homeostatic regulation of tissue-level Mn in the observed exposure range of respirable Mn (<0.2 mg/m(3)).

The objective of the present study was to examine behavioral traits among children with exposure to airborne manganese from a ferro-manganese alloy plant, located in the metropolitan region of Salvador, Brazil. The study included 34 boys and 36 girls, aged 7-12 years, living in two communities within a 3-km radius from the plant. For each child, hair manganese levels (MnH) and blood lead (PbB) levels were analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The Children's Behavior Check List (CBCL) (Portuguese version validated in Brazil) was administered to parents or caregivers, providing scale scores of internalizing (withdrawn, somatic complaints, and anxious/depressed scales), externalizing (disruptive and aggressive) behaviors and a separate scale for attention problems. Median and range for MnH and PbB were 11.48 mu g/g (range: 0.52-55.74); 1.1 mu g/dL (range: 0.5-6.1), respectively. Spearman correlation analyses showed that several behavioral indices were significantly correlated with MnH levels for girls, but not for boys: total externalizing behavior (rho = 0.484 vs rho = 0.041) and attention problem scores (rho = 0.542 vs rho = 0.003) coefficients were significantly at p < 0.001 level, respectively for girls and boys. No significant correlation was observed with any of the internalizing subscales. A linear regression model was fitted with the total externalizing behavior, inattention and total CBCL scores as dependent variables, with log transformed MnH stratified by sex, adjusting for age and maternal IQ. Total externalizing behaviors and attention problem scores were significantly associated with girls' MnH levels but not with boys'. Adjusting for maternal IQ the beta-coefficients for LogMnH associations with total externalizing and attention problems are 8.85 (95%CI 2.44-15.24) and 4.03 (95%CI 1.50-6.56) for girls. For boys, after adjusting for age, the beta-coefficients are 0.08 (95%CI 11.51-11.66) and -0.05 (95%CI 4.34-4.25), respectively. The findings of this study suggest a positive association between elevated Mn exposure and externalizing behavioral problems and inattention, with girls presenting more pronounced effects. Future studies on Mn exposure in children should attempt to further elucidate sex and/or gender differences in Mn exposed populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Traditional accounts of partial allocation have characterised behavior on a macroscopic timescale, reporting and studying the mean times spent in work or leisure. However, averaging over the more microscopic processes that govern choices is known to pose tricky theoretical problems, and also eschews any possibility of direct contact with the neural computations involved. We develop a microscopic framework, formalized as a semi-Markov decision process with possibly stochastic choices, in which subjects approximately maximise their expected returns by making momentary commitments to one or other activity. We show macroscopic utilities that arise from microscopic ones, and demonstrate how facets such as imperfect substitutability can arise in a more straightforward microscopic manner.

These sensitive mDA neurons express Pitx3, a transcription factor that is critical for their survival during development. We used this dependence to identify, by flow cytometry and expression profiling, the negative regulator of G-protein signaling Rgs6 for its restricted expression in these neurons. In contrast to Pitx3(-/-) mDA neurons that die during fetal (vSNc) or post-natal (VTA) period, the vSNc mDA neurons of Rgs6(-/-) mutant mice begin to exhibit unilateral signs of degeneration at around 6 months of age, and by one year cell loss is observed in a fraction of mice. Unilateral cell loss is accompanied by contralateral degenerating neurons that exhibit smaller cell size, altered morphology and reduced dendritic network. The degenerating neurons have low levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and decreased nuclear Pitx3; accordingly, expression of many Pitx3 target gene products is altered, including Vmat2, Bdnf, Aldh1a1 (Adh2) and Fgf10. These low TH neurons also express markers of increased dopamine signaling, namely increased DAT and phospho-Erk1/2 expression. The late onset degeneration may reflect the protective action of Rgs6 against excessive DA signaling throughout life. Rgs6-dependent protection is thus critical for adult survival and maintenance of the vSNc mDA neurons that are most affected in PD.

A Nonvolatile Associative Memory-Based Context-Driven Search Engine Using 90 nm CMOS/MTJ-Hybrid Logic-in-Memory Architecture	IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Associative memory; context-driven search; logic-in-memory; magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ); sparse clustered networks	NEURAL-NETWORKS	This paper presents algorithm, architecture, and fabrication results of a nonvolatile context-driven search engine that reduces energy consumption as well as computational delay compared to classical hardware and software-based approaches. The proposed architecture stores only associations between items from multiple search fields in the form of binary links, and merges repeated field items to reduce the memory requirements and accesses. The fabricated chip achieves memory reduction and 89% energy saving compared to a classical field-based approach in hardware, based on content-addressable memory (CAM). Furthermore, it achieves reduced number of clock cycles in performing search operations compared to the CAM, and five orders of magnitude reduced number of clock cycles compared to a fabricated and measured ultra low-power CPU-based counterpart running a classical search algorithm in software. The energy consumption of the proposed architecture is on average three orders of magnitude smaller than that of a software-based approach. A magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)-based logic-in-memory architecture is presented that allows simple routing and eliminates leakage current in standby using 90 nm CMOS/MTJ-hybrid technologies.

The present study examined the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the DLEC on retrograde and anterograde memory on two tests of allocentric spatial learning: a hidden fixed-platform watermaze task, and a novelty-preference-based dry-maze test. Deficits were observed on both tests when training occurred prior to but not following n-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) lesions of DLEC, suggesting retrograde memory impairment in the absence of anterograde impairments for the same information. The retrograde memory impairments were temporally-graded; rats that received DLEC lesions 1-3 days following training displayed deficits, while those that received lesions 7-10 days following training performed like a control group that received sham surgery. The deficits were not attenuated by co-infusion of tetrodotoxin, suggesting they are not due to disruption of neural processing in structures efferent to the DLEC, such as the hippocampus. The present findings provide evidence that the DLEC is involved in the consolidation of allocentric spatial information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evidence in support of the cognitive effects of epigenetics-based diet, and nutraceuticals is reviewed. A proactive epigenetics diet and nutraceuticals program holds promise as potential buffer against the negative impact of aging and stress responses on cognition, and can optimize vascular, metabolic, and brain health in the community.

In the present research, we captured the shaping of auditory perception by movement in humans by taking advantage of a specific context: music. Participants listened to a repeated rhythmical sequence before and after moving their bodies to this rhythm in a specific meter. We found that the brain responses to the rhythm (as recorded with electroencephalography) after body movement were significantly enhanced at frequencies related to the meter to which the participants had moved. These results provide evidence that body movement can selectively shape the subsequent internal representation of auditory rhythms.

In the present study, healthy participants were shown pictures of foods to determine the impact of caloric content on food choice. Brain activity was then measured while participants bid for a chance to purchase and eat one item. True caloric density, but not individual estimates of calorie content, predicted how much participants were willing to pay for each item. Caloric density also correlated with the neural response to food pictures in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain area that encodes the value of stimuli and predicts immediate consumption. That same region exhibited functional connectivity with an appetitive brain network, and this connectivity was modulated by willingness to pay. Despite the fact that participants were poor at explicitly judging caloric content, their willingness to pay and brain activity both correlated with actual caloric density. This suggests that the reward value of a familiar food is dependent on implicit knowledge of its caloric content.

The novel aim of this study was to elucidate the critical role of GAPDH and its interaction with beta-amyloid in the blood of Moroccan patients with familial AD (FAD) carrying presenilin mutations and in sporadic late onset AD (LOAD). Our results show a significant decrease in the activity of GAPDH in blood samples from patients with FAD as compared to sporadic cases and healthy controls. The expression level of GAPDH in brain specimens from mutant tau transgenic mice and patients with FAD was unchanged as compared to healthy controls. In contrast, the expression level of GAPDH in blood samples from mutant tau transgenic mice and patients with FAD was decreased as compared to sporadic cases and healthy controls. Moreover, there is an accumulation of beta-amyloid aggregates in the blood samples of patients with FAD and an increase in amyloid fibrils in both the blood and brain samples of these patients. Our study adds new insight to previous ones by showing the involvement of GAPDH in AD, which may influence the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease.

Neurotherapeutic effects of novel HO-1 inhibitors in vitro and in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; bioenergetic failure; heme oxygenase-1; oxidative stress	IMIDAZOLE-DIOXOLANE COMPOUNDS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HEME OXYGENASE ISOFORMS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; RAT-BRAIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; CARBON-MONOXIDE; IRON; MICE; BILIRUBIN	Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) encoded by the HMOX1 gene is a 32-kDa stress protein that catabolizes heme to biliverdin, free iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). Glial HO-1 is over-expressed in the CNS of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The HMOX1 gene is exquisitely sensitive to oxidative stress and is induced in brain and other tissues in various models of disease and trauma. Induction of the glial HMOX1 gene may lead to pathological brain iron deposition, intracellular oxidative damage, and bioenergetic failure in AD and other human CNS disorders such as PD and MS. Therefore, targeted suppression of glial HO-1 hyperactivity may prove to be a rational and effective therapeutic intervention in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we report the effects of QC-47, QC-56, and OB-28, novel azole-based competitive and reversible inhibitors of HO-1, on oxidative damage to whole-cell and mitochondrial compartments in rat astrocytes transfected with the HMOX1 gene. We also report the effect of OB-28 on the behavior and neuropathology of APP(swe)/PS1(E9) mice. OB-28 was found to reduce oxidative damage to whole-cell and mitochondrial compartments in rat astrocytes transfected with the HMOX1 gene. Moreover, OB-28 was found to significantly counter behavioral deficits and neuropathological alterations in APP(swe)/PS1(E9) mice. Attenuation of AD-associated behavioral deficits and neuropathological changes suggests that HO-1 may be a promising target for neuroprotective intervention in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

However, little is known about its impact on mobility, an important component of quality of life (QoL). To address this issue, we assessed the impact of STN DBS on life-space mobility and QoL. Methods: Twenty surgical patients with PD were assessed using mobility and QoL scales and the United Parkinson's disease rating scale, and results were compared before surgery and 6 to 9 months postoperatively. Results: STN DBS significantly improved motor dysfunction but had a limited impact on measures of life-space mobility and QoL. Interpretation: STN DBS improves motor function and some components of QoL. However, motor recovery does not translate into improved life-space in the intermediate term. In addition to a focus on motor function, multidisciplinary attention to increasing mobility may further improve QoL in the intermediate and long-term.

Autism Spectrum Disorder in a Term Birth Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Population	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						autism; term born; neonatal; high risk	PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS; RISK-FACTORS; CEREBRAL-PALSY; CHILDREN; PREVALENCE; EPILEPSY; CLASSIFICATION; DEFINITION; SURVIVORS	BACKGROUND: Nonspecific perinatal risk factors have been revealed to be associated with the development of autism spectrum disorder. However, term at-risk infants, as a distinct population, are underrepresented in the literature. This study examines the incidence and neonatal risk factors for autism spectrum disorder in term neonatal intensive care unit survivors. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis from a single university-practice database of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and followed by a single pediatric neurologist. Term infants (>= 37 weeks), born between 1991 and 2011, with at least 2 years (or 1 year if found to be neurologically normal) of follow-up were included. Principle outcomes were autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, global developmental delay, and epilepsy. RESULTS: One hundred eighty infants were included from a database of 564 neonates. Twelve (6.6%) developed autism spectrum disorder, 53 (29.4%) cerebral palsy, 77 (42.7%) global developmental delay, and 47 (26.1%) epilepsy. Seventy-one (39.4%) developed no adverse outcomes. Nine patients with autism spectrum disorder (75%) were diagnosed with at least one other adverse outcome. No neonatal or perinatal variables were evident to be significantly associated with later autism spectrum disorder. CONCLUSIONS: In term neonatal intensive care unit survivors, autism spectrum disorder occurs at a greater frequency than in the general population and often develops alongside comorbid conditions. This highlights the importance of screening term neonatal intensive care unit survivors for autism spectrum disorder, particularly when comorbidities are present.

The objective of the present study was to systematically test the HDAC genes for its association with schizophrenia. Methods: A family-based genetic association study (951 Caucasian subjects in 313 nuclear families) using 601 tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms in HDAC genes was conducted followed by a replication study of top-ranked markers in a sample of 1427 Caucasian subjects from 241 multiplex families and 176 trios. Epistasis interaction was tested by using the pedigree-based generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR). Furthermore, we analyzed exome sequencing data of 1134 subjects for detection of rare mutations in HDAC genomic regions. Results: In the exploratory study, ten markers were in significant association with schizophrenia (P < 0.01). One maker rs14251 (HDAC3) was replicated (P = 0.04) and remained significant in the whole sample (P = 0.004). GMDR identified that a significant three-locus interaction model was detected involving rs17265596 (HDAC9), rs7290710 (HDAC10) and rs7634112 (HDAC11) with a good testing accuracy (0.58). No rare mutations were found associated with schizophrenia. Conclusion: This first exploratory systematic study of the HDAC genes provides consistent support for the involvement of the HDAC3 gene in the etiology of schizophrenia. A statistical epistatic interaction between HDAC9, HDAC10, and HDAC11 was detected and seems biologically plausible. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

IMAGEN Consortium	Neural and Cognitive Correlates of the Common and Specific Variance Across Externalizing Problems in Young Adolescence	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; IMPULSIVE CHOICE; CONDUCT DISORDER; DISCOUNT RATES; SUBSTANCE USE; REWARD; BEHAVIOR; ADHD; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY	Objective: The authors sought to model the unique and common variance across conduct disorder, substance misuse, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to investigate the neurocognitive factors that relate generally or uniquely to externalizing problems in adolescence. Method: Personality and behavioral measures and functional imaging responses to reward sensitivity and response inhibition tasks were assessed in 1,778 European adolescents at age 14 and, using structural equation modeling, were related to the unique and common variance across externalizing problems assessed and modeled at ages 14 and 16. Results: Externalizing problems best fit a general-specific model made up of a specific factor representing ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms, a specific factor representing substance misuse symptoms, and a common externalizing factor representing the variance shared among all symptoms. Common variance across externalizing problems was associated with high impulsivity and delay discounting as well as low blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response in the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus but high BOLD response in the presupplementary motor area and precentral gyrus during successful inhibition. Unique variance for ADHD/conduct disorder was associated with impulsivity, poor response inhibition, and high delay discounting, as well as low BOLD response in frontal brain areas bilaterally during failed inhibition. In contrast, unique variance for substance misuse was associated with high sensation seeking and delay discounting, as well as differential brain response to reward anticipation: high BOLD response in the left orbitofrontal cortex but low BOLD response in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Conclusions: Personality, behavioral, and fMRI findings suggest that abnormalities in response inhibition, error processing, and reward processing are differentially implicated in underlying vulnerability specific to ADHD/conduct disorder and substance misuse and general to externalizing problems.

Small relapse numbers, differing diagnostic criteria, and single region studies limit the generalizability of prior results. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a temporal variation in onset of relapses in both hemispheres and to determine whether seasonal peak relapse probability varies with latitude. MethodsThe international MSBase Registry was utilized to analyze seasonal relapse onset distribution by hemisphere and latitudinal location. All analyses were weighted for the patient number contributed by each center. A sine regression model was used to model relapse onset and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) seasonality. Linear regression was used to investigate associations of latitude and lag between UVR trough and subsequent relapse peak. ResultsA total of 32,762 relapses from 9,811 patients across 30 countries were analyzed. Relapse onset followed an annual cyclical sinusoidal pattern with peaks in early spring and troughs in autumn in both hemispheres. Every 10 degrees of latitude away from the equator was associated with a mean decrease in UVR trough to subsequent relapse peak lag of 28.5 days (95% confidence interval=3.29-53.71, p=0.028). InterpretationWe demonstrate for the first time that there is a latitude-dependent relationship between seasonal UVR trough and relapse onset probability peak independent of location-specific UVR levels, with more distal latitude associated with shorter gaps. We confirm prior meta-analyses showing a strong seasonal relapse onset probability variation in the northern hemisphere, and extend this observation to the southern hemisphere.

Given that correlation coefficients are derived from both covariance and variance, group differences in covariance may be obscured by differences in the variance terms. To facilitate a comprehensive assessment of connectivity, we propose a unified statistical framework that interrogates the individual terms of the correlation coefficient. We have evaluated the utility of this method for metabolic connectivity analysis using [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. As an illustrative example of the utility of this approach, we examined metabolic connectivity in angular gyrus and precuneus seed regions of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects with low and high beta-amyloid burdens. This new multivariate method allowed us to identify alterations in the metabolic connectome, which would not have been detected using classic seed-based correlation analysis. Ultimately, this novel approach should be extensible to brain network analysis and broadly applicable to other imaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Alzheimer's disease	PATHOLOGIE BIOLOGIE			English	Review						GAPDH; Alzheimer's disease; beta-amyloid aggregation; Neurofibrillary tangles	AMYLOID-BETA-PROTEIN; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; PROTEOMICS APPROACH; CELL-DEATH; RAT-BRAIN; A-BETA; IDENTIFICATION; TAU; TAUOPATHIES	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis and thus, serves to break down glucose for energy production. Beyond the traditional aerobic metabolism of glucose, recent studies have highlighted additional roles played by GAPDH in nonmetabolic processes, such as control of gene expression and redox post-translational modifications. Neuroproteomics have revealed high affinity interactions between GAPDH and Alzheimer's disease-associated proteins, including the beta-amyloid, beta-amyloid precursor protein and tau. This neuronal protein interaction may lead to impairment of the GAPDH glycolytic function in Alzheimer's disease and may be a forerunner of its participation in apoptosis. The present review examines the crucial implication of GAPDH in neurodegenerative processes and clarifies its role in apoptotic cell death. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

It has been proposed that this insulin sensitivity is important for their longevity and increased healthspan. We tested whether this insulin sensitivity of the GHR-KO mouse is necessary for its retarded aging by abrogating that sensitivity with a transgenic alteration that improves development and secretory function of pancreatic -cells by expressing Igf-1 under the rat insulin promoter 1 (RIP::IGF-1). The RIP::IGF-1 transgene increased circulating insulin content in GHR-KO mice, and thusly fully normalized their insulin sensitivity, without affecting the proliferation of any non--cell cell types. Multiple (nonsurvivorship) longevity-associated physiological and endocrinological characteristics of these mice (namely beneficial blood glucose regulatory control, altered metabolism, and preservation of memory capabilities) were partially or completely normalized, thus supporting the causal role of insulin sensitivity for the decelerated senescence of GHR-KO mice. We conclude that a delayed onset and/or decreased pace of aging can be hormonally regulated.

Case management reduces global vascular risk after stroke: Secondary results from the The preventing recurrent vascular events and neurological worsening through intensive organized case-management randomized controlled trial	AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL			English	Article							CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; PRIMARY-CARE; IMPACT; INTERVENTION; HYPERTENSION; PHARMACISTS; PREVALENCE; MORTALITY	Background Survivors of ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at high risk for other vascular events. We evaluated the impact of 2 types of case management (hard touch with pharmacist or soft touch with nurse) added to usual care on global vascular risk. Methods This is a prespecified secondary analysis of a 6-month trial conducted in outpatients with recent stroke/TIA who received usual care and were randomized to additional monthly visits with either nurse case managers (who counseled patients, monitored risk factors, and communicated results to primary care physicians) or pharmacist case managers (who were also able to independently prescribe according to treatment algorithms). The Framingham Risk Score [FRS]) and the Cardiovascular Disease Life Expectancy Model (CDLEM) were used to estimate 10-year risk of any vascular event at baseline, 6 months (trial conclusion), and 12 months (6 months after last trial visit). Results Mean age of the 275 evaluable patients was 67.6 years. Both study arms were well balanced at baseline and exhibited reductions in absolute global vascular risk estimates at 6 months: median 4.8% (Interquartile range (IQR) 0.3%-11.3%) for the pharmacist arm versus 5.1% (IQR 1.9%-12.5%) for the nurse arm on the FRS (P=.44 between arms) and median 10.0% (0.1%-31.6%) versus 12.5% (2.1%-30.5%) on the CDLEM (P=.37). These reductions persisted at 12 months: median 6.4% (1.2%-11.6%) versus 5.5% (2.0%-12.0%) for the FRS (P=.83) and median 8.4% (0.1%-28.3%) versus 13.1% (1.6%-31.6%) on the CDLEM (P=.20). Conclusions Case management by nonphysician providers is associated with improved global vascular risk in patients with recent stroke/TIA. Reductions achieved during the active phase of the trial persisted after trial conclusion.

In vivo properties of KNT-127, a novel delta opioid receptor agonist: receptor internalization, antihyperalgesia and antidepressant effects in mice	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ANALGESIC TOLERANCE; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; PHARMACOLOGY; PAIN; CONVULSIONS; MECHANISMS; DISCOVERY; LIGANDS; ADL5859	Background and PurposeActivation of opioid (DOP) receptors regulates pain and emotional responses, and also displays ligand-biased agonism. KNT-127 (1,2,3,4,4a,5,12,12a-octahydro-2-methyl-4a,1-([1,2]benzenomethano)-2,6-diazanaphthacene-12a,17-diol) is a novel DOP receptor agonist inducing analgesia and antidepressant effects in mice. Here, we have assessed KNT-127 for (i) analgesia against chronic inflammatory pain; (ii) effects on depression, locomotion and DOP receptor internalization; and (iii) for cross-tolerance to analgesic and antidepressant effects of acute treatment by other DOP receptor agonists. Experimental ApproachInflammatory pain was induced by complete Freund's adjuvant injection into tail or hindpaw, and thermal and mechanical sensitivities were determined in mice. Locomotor and antidepressant-like effects were measured using actimetry and forced swim test respectively. In vivoKNT-127 selectivity and internalization were assessed using DOP receptor knockout mice and knock-in mice expressing fluorescent-tagged DOP receptors. KNT-127 was injected acutely at 0.1-10.0mg<bold>kg(</bold>-1) or administered chronically at 5mg<bold>kg(</bold>-1) daily over 5 days. Key ResultsAcute treatment with KNT-127 reversed inflammatory hyperalgesia, produced an antidepressant-like effect but induced neither hyperlocomotion nor receptor sequestration. Chronic treatment with KNT-127 induced tolerance and cross-tolerance to SNC80-induced analgesia, but no tolerance to SNC80-evoked hyperlocomotor or antidepressant-like effects. Conclusions and ImplicationsThe DOP receptor agonist KNT-127 induced agonist-specific acute and chronic responses, at both behavioural and cellular levels. It displays activities similar to the other recently reported DOP agonists, AR-M1000390, ADL5747 and ADL5859, and differs from SNC80. SNC80 differs from the other DOP receptor agonists including KNT-127, by exhibiting ligand-biased tolerance at this receptor.

Many of the changes involve the application of novel technologies to tackle common challenges in optimizing perioperative management. Herein, we illustrate recent advances in perioperative management by focusing on a number of novel components that we judge to be particularly important. These include: the introduction of brain and somatic oximetry; transesophageal echocardiographic hemodynamic monitoring and bedside focused ultrasound; ultrasound-guided vascular access; point-of-care coagulation surveillance; right ventricular pressure monitoring; novel inhaled treatment for right ventricular failure; new approaches for postoperative pain management; novel approaches in specialized care procedures to ensure quality control; and specific approaches to optimize the management for postoperative cardiac arrest. Herein, we discuss the reasons that each of these components are particularly important in improving perioperative care, describe how they can be addressed, and their impact in the care of patients who undergo cardiac surgery.

FORGE Canada Consortium	Evidence for clinical, genetic and biochemical variability in spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						acid ceramidase deficiency; ceramide; progressive myoclonic epilepsy; spinal muscular atrophy; whole exome sequencing	ACID CERAMIDASE; FARBER-DISEASE; DEFICIENCY; MUTATIONS; CELLS	Spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME) is a recently delineated, autosomal recessive condition caused by rare mutations in the N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1 (acid ceramidase) ASAH1 gene. It is characterized by motor neuron disease followed by progressive myoclonic seizures and eventual death due to respiratory insufficiency. Here we report an adolescent female who presented with atonic and absence seizures and myoclonic jerks and was later diagnosed as having myoclonic-absence seizures. An extensive genetic and metabolic work-up was unable to arrive at a molecular diagnosis. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified two rare, deleterious mutations in the ASAH1 gene: c.850G>T;p.Gly284X and c.456A>C;p.Lys152Asn. These mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the patient and her parents. Functional studies in cultured fibroblasts showed that acid ceramidase was reduced in both overall amount and enzymatic activity. Ceramide level was doubled in the patient's fibroblasts as compared to control cells. The results of the WES and the functional studies prompted an electromyography (EMG) study that showed evidence of motor neuron disease despite only mild proximal muscle weakness. These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of SMA-PME caused by novel mutations in ASAH1 and highlight the clinical utility of WES for rare, intractable forms of epilepsy.	[Dyment, D.

Hcfc1b, a zebrafish ortholog of HCFC1, regulates craniofacial development by modulating mmachc expression	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						HCFC1; Cobalamin; Craniofacial defects; Facial dysmorphia; MMACHC	EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS; COMBINED METHYLMALONIC ACIDURIA; NEURAL CREST; CLEFT-PALATE; COBALAMIN METABOLISM; FOLATE-DEFICIENCY; ORAL CLEFTS; FOLIC-ACID; GENE; MUTATIONS	Mutations in HCFC1 (MIM300019), have been recently associated with cblX (MIM309541), an X-linked, recessive disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies including craniofacial abnormalities. HCFC1 is a transcriptional co-regulator that modulates the expression of numerous downstream target genes including MMACHC, but it is not clear how these HCFC1 targets play a role in the clinical manifestations of cblX. To begin to elucidate the mechanism by which HCFC1 modulates disease phenotypes, we have carried out loss of function analyses in the developing zebrafish. Of the two HCFC1 orthologs in zebrafish, hcfc1a and hcfc1b, the loss of hcfc1b specifically results in defects in craniofacial development. Subsequent analysis revealed that hcfc1a regulates cranial neural crest cell differentiation and proliferation within the posterior pharyngeal arches. Further, the hcfc1b-mediated craniofacial abnormalities were rescued by expression of human MMACHC, a downstream target of HCFC1 that is aberrantly expressed in cblX. Furthermore, we tested distinct human HCFC1 mutations for their role in craniofacial development and demonstrated variable effects on MMACHC expression in humans and craniofacial development in zebrafish. Notably, several individuals with mutations in either HCFC1 or MMACHC have been reported to have mild to moderate facial dysmorphia.

Magnetization transfer ratio in the delayed-release dimethyl fumarate DEFINE study	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetization transfer ratio; Multiple sclerosis	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED PHASE-3; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS LESION; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ORAL BG-12; REMYELINATION; BRAIN; DEMYELINATION; EVOLUTION; NEUROPROTECTION	We measured changes in brain magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) as a potential indicator of myelin density in brain tissue of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) treated with delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in the Phase 3 DEFINE study. DEFINE was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which patients with RRMS were randomized 1:1:1 to 2 years of treatment with delayed-release DMF 240 mg twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID) or placebo. MTR was analyzed in whole brain and normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT) at baseline, week 24, 1 year, and 2 years in a subset of patients. MTR data from 392 patients were analyzed. Mean percentage reduction from baseline to 2 years in median whole brain MTR was -0.386 % in the placebo group vs increases of 0.129 % (p = 0.0027) and 0.096 % (p = 0.0051) in the delayed-release DMF BID and TID groups, respectively. Similarly, mean percentage reduction from baseline in median NABT MTR was -0.392 % with placebo vs increases of 0.190 % (p = 0.0006) and 0.115 % (p = 0.0029) with delayed-release DMF BID and TID, respectively. Post hoc analysis of data from patients with no new or enlarging T2 lesions (n = 147), or who experienced no relapses (n = 238), yielded similar results. In this analysis, increases in MTR in brain tissue most likely reflect increases in myelin density in response to delayed-release DMF. These data in patients with RRMS are consistent with preclinical studies that indicate a potential for cytoprotection and remyelination with delayed-release DMF treatment.

However, the time course of electroencephalographic delta activity during sleep, which represents the main marker of sleep intensity associated with recovery during sleep, has never been described in this non-human primate. In this study, telemetry implants were used to record one spontaneous 24-h sleep-wake cycle in four freely-moving Cynomolgus monkeys, and to quantify the time course of electroencephalographic activity during sleep using spectral analysis. Animals presented a diurnal activity pattern interrupted by short naps. During the dark period, most of the time was spent in sleep with non-rapid eye movement sleep/rapid eye movement sleep alternations and sleep consolidation profiles intermediate between rodents and humans. Deep non-rapid eye movement sleep showed a typical predominance at the beginning of the night with decreased propensity in the course of the night, which was accompanied by a progressive increase in rapid eye movement sleep duration. Spectral profiles showed characteristic changes between vigilance states as reported in other mammalian species. Importantly, delta activity also followed the expected time course of variation, showing a build-up with wakefulness duration and dissipation across the night. Thus, Cynomolgus monkeys present typical characteristics of sleep architecture and spectral structure as those observed in other mammalian species including humans, validating the use of telemetry in this non-human primate model for translational sleep studies.

J	O'Reilly, C; Gosselin, N; Carrier, J; Nielsen, T				O'Reilly, Christian; Gosselin, Nadia; Carrier, Julie; Nielsen, Tore			Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies: an open-access resource for instrument benchmarking and exploratory research	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						collaboration tool; methodology; open-data; reproducibility	SPINDLE DETECTION; K-COMPLEX; STAGE CLASSIFICATION; AUTOMATED DETECTION; HYPOPNEA EVENTS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EEG; VALIDATION; ARTIFACTS; SYSTEM	Manual processing of sleep recordings is extremely time-consuming. Efforts to automate this process have shown promising results, but automatic systems are generally evaluated on private databases, not allowing accurate cross-validation with other systems. In lacking a common benchmark, the relative performances of different systems are not compared easily and advances are compromised. To address this fundamental methodological impediment to sleep study, we propose an open-access database of polysomnographic biosignals. To build this database, whole-night recordings from 200 participants [97 males (aged 42.9 +/- 19.8years) and 103 females (aged 38.3 +/- 18.9years); age range: 18-76years] were pooled from eight different research protocols performed in three different hospital-based sleep laboratories. All recordings feature a sampling frequency of 256Hz and an electroencephalography (EEG) montage of 4-20 channels plus standard electro-oculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG) and respiratory signals. Access to the database can be obtained through the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) website (), and requires only affiliation with a research institution and prior approval by the applicant's local ethical review board. Providing the research community with access to this free and open sleep database is expected to facilitate the development and cross-validation of sleep analysis automation systems. It is also expected that such a shared resource will be a catalyst for cross-centre collaborations on difficult topics such as improving inter-rater agreement on sleep stage scoring.

Here we identify in rodents and humans a population of VIA dopaminergic neurons expressing corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). We provide further evidence in rodents that chronic nicotine exposure upregulates Crh mRNA (encoding CRF) in dopaminergic neurons of the posterior VIA, activates local CRF1 receptors and blocks nicotine-induced activation of transient GABAergic input to dopaminergic neurons. Local downregulation of Crh mRNA and specific pharmacological blockade of CRF1 receptors in the VIA reversed the effect of nicotine on GABAergic input to dopaminergic neurons, prevented the aversive effects of nicotine withdrawal and limited the escalation of nicotine intake. These results link the brain reward and stress systems in the same brain region to signaling of the negative motivational effects of nicotine withdrawal.

Both distal and proximal factors contribute to suicidal behaviour. Distal factors - such as familial and genetic predisposition, as well as early-life adversity - increase the lifetime risk of suicide. They alter responses to stress and other processes through epigenetic modification of genes and associated changes in gene expression, and through the regulation of emotional and behavioural traits. Proximal factors are associated with the precipitation of a suicidal event and include alterations in key neurotransmitter systems, inflammatory changes and glial dysfunction in the brain. This Review explores the key molecular changes that are associated with suicidality and discusses some promising avenues for future research.

In this study, we investigated the cross-sectional relationship between visceral fat (VF), total body fat (TBF) and three MRI parameters in the brains of typically developing adolescents: (i) T1-weighted (T1W) signal intensity; (ii) T1W signal contrast between white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM); and (iii) magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). In a community-based sample of 970 adolescents (12-18 years old, 466 males), VF was quantified using MRI, and total body fat was measured using a multifrequency bioimpedance. T1W images of the brain were used to determine signal intensity in lobar GM and WM, as well as WM: GM signal contrast. A magnetization transfer (MT) sequence of MTON and MTOFF was used to obtain MTR in GM and WM. We found that both larger volumes of VF and more TBF were independently associated with higher signal intensity in WM and higher WM: GM signal contrast, as well as higher MTR in both GM and WM. These relationships were independent of a number of potential confounders, including age, sex, puberty stage, household income and height. Our results suggest that both visceral fat and fat deposited elsewhere in the body are associated independently with structural properties of the adolescent brain. We speculate that these relationships suggest the presence of adiposity-related variations in phospholipid composition of brain lipids. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

For clinical settings, limited scan time compromises the possibilities to achieve high image resolution for finer anatomical details and signal-to-noise-ratio for reliable fibre reconstruction. We assessed the potential benefits of interpolating DWI datasets to a higher image resolution before fibre reconstruction using a diffusion tensor model. Simulations of straight and curved crossing tracts smaller than or equal to the voxel size showed that conventional higher-order interpolation methods improved the geometrical representation of white-matter tracts with reduced partial-volume-effect (PVE), except at tract boundaries. Simulations and interpolation of ex-vivo monkey brain DWI datasets revealed that conventional interpolation methods fail to disentangle fine anatomical details if PVE is too pronounced in the original data. As for validation we used ex-vivo DWI datasets acquired at various image resolutions as well as Nissl-stained sections. Increasing the image resolution by a factor of eight yielded finer geometrical resolution and more anatomical details in complex regions such as tract boundaries and cortical layers, which are normally only visualized at higher image resolutions. Similar results were found with typical clinical human DWI dataset. However, a possible bias in quantitative values imposed by the interpolation method used should be considered. The results indicate that conventional interpolation methods can be successfully applied to DWI datasets for mining anatomical details that are normally seen only at higher resolutions, which will aid in tractography and microstructural mapping of tissue compartments.

Disease onset is most commonly marked by recurrent fevers, irritability, and developmental regression in the 1st year of life. A stable phase characterized by severe spastic quadriparesis and cognitive deficit follows. Brain calcifications, leukoencephalopathy, and cerebral atrophy are the radiological hallmarks of AGS and often show progression over time. We present an atypical patient with late-onset AGS characterized by spastic paraparesis and a leukoencephalopathy that markedly improved during follow-up, demonstrating a nonprogressive disease course and the exceptional amelioration of the white matter abnormalities.

In order to study the prevalence and significance of ALT in childhood brain tumors we screened 517 pediatric brain tumors using the novel C-circle assay. We examined the association of ALT with alterations in genes found to segregate with specific histological phenotypes and with clinical outcome. ALT was detected almost exclusively in malignant tumors (p = 0.001). ALT was highly enriched in primitive neuroectodermal tumors (12 %), choroid plexus carcinomas (23 %) and high-grade gliomas (22 %). Furthermore, in contrast to adult gliomas, pediatric low grade gliomas which progressed to high-grade tumors did not exhibit the ALT phenotype. Somatic but not germline TP53 mutations were highly associated with ALT (p = 1.01 x 10(-8)). Of the other alterations examined, only ATRX point mutations and reduced expression were associated with the ALT phenotype (p = 0.0005). Interestingly, ALT attenuated the poor outcome conferred by TP53 mutations in specific pediatric brain tumors. Due to very poor prognosis, one year overall survival was quantified in malignant gliomas, while in children with choroid plexus carcinoma, five year overall survival was investigated. For children with TP53 mutant malignant gliomas, one year overall survival was 63 +/- A 12 and 23 +/- A 10 % for ALT positive and negative tumors, respectively (p = 0.03), while for children with TP53 mutant choroid plexus carcinomas, 5 years overall survival was 67 +/- A 19 and 27 +/- A 13 % for ALT positive and negative tumors, respectively (p = 0.07). These observations suggest that the presence of ALT is limited to a specific group of childhood brain cancers which harbor somatic TP53 mutations and may influence the outcome of these patients. Analysis of ALT may contribute to risk stratification and targeted therapies to improve outcome for these children.

Now You See It, Now You Don't: Testing Environments Modulate the Association Between Hippocampal Volume and Cortisol Levels in Young and Older Adults	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						hippocampal volume; cortisol; testing environment; aging; stress reactivity; basal cortisol	PITUITARY-ADRENOCORTICAL AXIS; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; AWAKENING RESPONSE; SALIVARY CORTISOL; STRESS; BRAIN; COGNITION; MEN; REACTIVITY; ATROPHY	The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis production of the stress hormone cortisol interacts with the hippocampal formation and impacts memory function. A growing interest is to determine whether hippocampal volume (HV) predicts basal and/or reactive cortisol levels in young and older adults. Recent evidence shows that contextual features in testing environments might be stressful and inadvertently induce a stress response in young and/or older populations. This latter result suggests that variations in testing environments might influence associations between HV and cortisol levels in young and older adults. To this end, we investigated 28 healthy young adults (ages 18-35) and 32 healthy older adults (ages 60-75) in two different environments constructed to be more or less stressful for each age group (Favoring-Young versus Favoring-Old conditions). Cortisol levels were repeatedly assessed in each environment, and young and older participants underwent an anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scan for subsequent assessment of HV. Results in both age groups showed that HV was significantly associated with cortisol levels only in the unfavorable stressful testing conditions specific for each age group. This association was absent when testing environments were designed to decrease stress for each age group. These findings are fundamental in showing that unless the nature of the testing environment is taken into consideration, detected associations between HV and cortisol levels in both young and older populations might be confounded by environmental stress.

The objective of this study was to determine the direct costs of care 2 years after an SCI, stratifying for completeness and level of injury. A retrospective database analysis was carried out using data from the Quebec Trauma Registry, the Quebec Medical Insurance Board, and the Quebec Automobile Insurance Corporation between 1997 and 2007. Excluding individuals sustaining moderate or severe traumatic brain injuries, 481 individuals who sustained an SCI from motor vehicle accidents were identified. Individuals were classified as complete and incomplete in the following categories: C1-C7, C8-T6, T7-L1, L2-S5. Using data from governmental public healthcare organizations makes this study comprehensive. For C1-C7 complete and incomplete spinal cord injuries, the first-year cost was $157 718 and $56 505, respectively (2009 Canadian dollars calculated per patient). Similar differences between complete and incomplete spinal cord injuries were seen for the other groups. Furthermore, for complete injuries, costs were higher for higher levels of injury during both the first and the second year after injury. For incomplete lesions, costs did not differ significantly between groups during the first or the second year. Incomplete spinal cord injuries result in lower healthcare costs compared with complete injuries across all groups during the first 2 years after injury. As less severe levels of injury result in measurably lower costs, the funds spent to reduce the severity or level of SCI could at least partially be recouped through healthcare savings.

There was a perception of pediatric neuro-oncologists that the incidence had declined in Canada. An epidemiological survey was undertaken to determine the incidence of this tumor in Canada and if a change had indeed occurred. All patients 14 years and under diagnosed with medulloblastoma from 1990 to 2009 inclusive in Canada were included. Data collected included date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, gender, stage, pathology, treatment, recurrence and current status. Data were analysed for change in incidence over time. Data were obtained on 574 eligible patients. The mean overall incidence per 1,000,000 persons was 4.82 (95 % CI 4.28-5.35) for the study time period. The mean age at diagnosis was 5.8 years, and there was a male predominance. Although there was an increase in incidence over the first three time periods (24 % for 1990-1994, 27.5 % for 1995-1999, 27.7 % for 2000-2004), the most recent time period (2005-2009) showed a decrease (21 %). This was true for male children while the incidence was stable for females. The mean incidence rate was double for children under the age of 5 years (7.92 per million) compared to those over 5 years (3.64 per million). This study showed that from 1990 to 2009 the incidence of medulloblastoma was relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the last five-year time period.

Peripherin up-regulation occurs during acute neuronal injury and in degenerating motor neurons of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The functional role(s) of peripherin during normal, injurious, and disease conditions remains unknown, but may be related to differential expression of spliced isoforms. To better understand peripherin function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen on a mouse brain cDNA library using an assembly incompetent peripherin isoform, Per-61, as bait. We identified new peripherin interactors with roles in vesicular trafficking, signal transduction, DNA/RNA processing, protein folding, and mitochondrial metabolism. We focused on the interaction of Per-61 and the constitutive isoform, Per-58, with SNAP25 interacting protein 30 (SIP30), a neuronal protein involved in SNAP receptor-dependent exocytosis. We found that peripherin and SIP30 interacted through coiled-coil domains and colocalized in cytoplasmic aggregates in SW13vim(-) cells. Interestingly, Per-61 and Per-58 differentially altered the subcellular distribution of SIP30 and SNAP25 in primary motor neurons. Our findings suggest a novel role of peripherin in vesicle trafficking.

In this study, positron emission tomography with the tracer alpha-[C-11]methyl-l-tryptophan (C-11-AMT) was used to compare human brain serotonin (5-HT) synthesis capacity in 17 currently drug-free MDMA polydrug users with that in 18 healthy matched controls. Gender differences and associations between regional C-11-AMT trapping and characteristics of MDMA use were also examined. MDMA polydrug users exhibited lower normalized C-11-AMT trapping in pre-frontal, orbitofrontal, and parietal regions, relative to controls. These differences were more widespread in males than in females. Increased normalized C-11-AMT trapping in MDMA users was also observed, mainly in the brainstem and in frontal and temporal areas. Normalized C-11-AMT trapping in the brainstem and pre-frontal regions correlated positively and negatively, respectively, with greater lifetime accumulated MDMA use, longer durations of MDMA use, and shorter time elapsed since the last MDMA use. Although the possibility of pre-existing 5-HT alterations pre-disposing people to use MDMA cannot be ruled out, regionally decreased 5-HT synthesis capacity in the forebrain could be interpreted as neurotoxicity of MDMA on distal (frontal) brain regions. On the other hand, increased 5-HT synthesis capacity in the raphe and adjacent areas could be due to compensatory mechanisms.

Neonatal Onset of Leptin Signalling in Dopamine Neurones of The Ventral Tegmental Area in The Rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						leptin; pSTAT3; pERK1/2; neonatal development; dopamine; ventral tegmental area	FOOD-INTAKE; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; ENERGY-BALANCE; RECEPTOR; EXPRESSION; HYPOTHALAMUS; NUCLEUS; BRAIN; GENE; NEUROPEPTIDES	Leptin inhibits feeding by acting on hypothalamic and mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathways involved in the homeostatic and hedonic control of energy balance. In the rodent, the neonatal period is characterised by high circulating leptin concentrations and an insensitivity to the anorectic effects of this hormone, suggesting that the modulation of these circuits by leptin is reduced during this period. The present study aimed to examine the onset of the functional ventral tegmental area (VTA) response to leptin during the neonatal period and to characterise the phenotype of leptin-responsive VTA neurones. On postnatal day (PND) 10 in pups insensitive to the anorectic effects of leptin and exclusively dependent on their mother for feeding, leptin administration failed to increase phosphorylated signal transducer of activation and transcription 3 (pSTAT3) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK)1/2 immunoreactivity in the midbrain. At the onset of independent feeding on PND16, leptin stimulated pSTAT3 production in the lateral parabrachial pigmented area of the midbrain, with a subset of these pSTAT3-positive neurones co-localising with tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker of DA neurones. Leptin did not increase pERK1/2 immunoreactivity in DA neurones on PND16. These results suggest that the insensitivity of PND10 pups to the anorectic effects of leptin might be mediated, at least in part, by a lack of signalling through the Janus kinase/STAT signalling pathway in VTA DA neurones in response to leptin before the onset of independent feeding.

Acute liver failure-induced hepatic encephalopathy is associated with changes in microRNA expression profiles in cerebral cortex of the rat	METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE			English	Article						Liver disease; miRNA; Non-codingRNA; Hepatic encephalopathy; Neuroprotection, Molecular signaling	BRAIN EDEMA; OXIDATIVE STRESS; AMMONIA; ABNORMALITIES; MECHANISMS; CIRRHOSIS; PATHWAYS; TARGETS; MODEL	The mechanisms that promote brain dysfunction after acute liver failure (ALF) are not clearly understood. The small noncoding RNAs known as microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly control mRNA translation and thus normal and pathological functions in the mammalian body. To understand their significance in ALF, we currently profiled the expression of miRNAs in the cerebral cortex of mice sacrificed at coma stage following treatment with azoxymethane. Of the 470 miRNAs profiled using microarrays, 37 were significantly altered (20 up-and 17 down-regulated) in their expression in the ALF group compared to sham group. In silico analysis showed that the ALF-responsive miRNAs target on average 231 mRNAs/miRNA (range: 3 to 840 targets). Pathways analysis showed that many miRNAs altered after ALF target multiple mRNAs that are part of various biological and molecular pathways. Glutamatergic synapse, Wnt signaling, MAP-kinase signaling, axon guidance, PI3-kinase-AKT signaling, T-cell receptor signaling and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis are the top pathways targeted by the ALF-sensitive miRNAs. At least 28 ALF-responsive miRNAs target each of the above pathways. We hypothesize that alterations in miRNAs and their down-stream mRNAs of signaling pathways might play a role in the induction and progression of neurological dysfunction observed during ALF.

Increasing evidence suggests these focal histological lesions may be representative of a gliopathy in which astrocyte-related changes are a major feature of the disorder. These changes include a loss of the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST concomitant with elevated interstitial glutamate levels, lowered brain pH associated with increased lactate production, decreased levels of GFAP, reduction in the levels of glutamine synthetase, swelling, alterations in levels of aquaporin-4, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. This review focusses on how these manifestations contribute to the pathophysiology of TD and possibly WE.

In addition to suffering from the constant stress of living with this neurological condition, patients also frequently experience comorbid psychiatric and cognitive disorders which significantly impact their quality of life. There is growing appreciation that stress, in particular occurring in early life, can negatively impact brain development, creating an enduring vulnerability to develop epilepsy. This aligns with the solid connections between early life environments and the development of psychiatric conditions, promoting the possibility that adverse early life events could represent a common risk factor for the later development of both epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric disorders. The influence of sex has been little studied, but recent research points to potential important interactions, particularly with regard to effects mediated by HPA axis programming. Understanding these interactions, and the underlying molecular mechanisms, will provide important new insights into the causation of both epilepsy and of psychiatric disorders, and potentially open up novel avenues for treatment.

Impairment of Brain Mitochondrial Charybdotoxin- and ATP-Insensitive BK Channel Activities in Diabetes	NEUROMOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Diabetes; Brain; Mitochondria; Potassium channel; Mitochondrial BK channel; Rats	CA2+-ACTIVATED K+ CHANNELS; LARGE-CONDUCTANCE; POTASSIUM CHANNEL; INNER MEMBRANE; RAT-BRAIN; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; BETA-4 SUBUNIT; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; ACTIVATION; RESISTANT	Existing evidence indicates an impairment of mitochondrial functions and alterations in potassium channel activities in diabetes. Because mitochondrial potassium channels have been involved in several mitochondrial functions including cytoprotection, apoptosis and calcium homeostasis, a study was carried out to consider whether the gating behavior of the mitochondrial ATP- and ChTx-insensitive Ca2+-activated potassium channel (mitoBK(Ca)) is altered in a streptozotocin (STZ) model of diabetes. Using ion channel incorporation of brain mitochondrial inner membrane into the bilayer lipid membrane, we provide in this work evidence for modifications of the mitoBK(Ca) ion permeation properties with channels from vesicles preparations coming from diabetic rats characterized by a significant decrease in conductance. More importantly, the open probability of channels from diabetic rats was reduced 1.5-2.5 fold compared to control, the most significant decrease being observed at depolarizing potentials. Because BKCa beta 4 subunit has been documented to left shift the BKCa channel voltage dependence curve in high Ca2+ conditions, a Western blot analysis was undertaken where the expression of mitoBK(Ca) alpha and beta 4 subunits was estimated using of anti-alpha and beta 4 subunit antibodies. Our results indicated a significant decrease in mitoBK(Ca) beta 4 subunit expression coupled to a decrease in the expression of alpha subunit, an observation compatible with the observed decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity. Our results thus demonstrate a modification in the mitoBK(Ca) channel gating properties in membrane preparations coming from STZ model of diabetic rats, an effect potentially linked to a change in mitoBK(Ca) beta 4 and alpha subunits expression and/or to an increase in reactive oxygen species production in high glucose conditions.

(2) To assess if these differences can be correlated with patients' perception of dizziness-induced handicap. Study Design: Prospective matched-pairs study Setting: Tertiary referral center Patients: Thirty-one vestibular schwannoma patients with documented postoperative unilateral vestibular loss and their age-, gender-, and physical activity level-matched controls with symmetric vestibulo-ocular reflexes. Interventions: Head movements during 10 tasks from daily life were recorded using body-worn movement sensors. Main Outcome Measures: The time to complete the task, the average head velocity and acceleration during each task, and the number of head turns performed were compared between cases and controls. These measures were then correlated with the self-reported Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores of the patients. Results: Patients with a unilateral vestibular deficit took significantly longer to perform most daily life activities compared to controls. Their head movements, however, were not always slower. They adopted a different movement strategy, in certain instances less efficient and more disorganized. Dimensions of movement are not all affected equally after a unilateral vestibular loss with evidence of clear clustering of the differences within dimensions across tasks. There was no correlation between the DHI and patients' performance in those tasks. Conclusion: Vestibular loss, even when compensated, affects patients' movements, which can be measured in an ambulatory setting of daily life activities. The differences in movements associated with vestibular loss do not correlate with the degree of self-reported handicap.

The majority of cases are sporadic (SALS) and only 5-10% have a family history (FALS). FALS cases show a high heritability and this has enabled the identification of several genetic triggers, of which mutations in SOD1, FUS, TARDBP and C90RF72 are the most frequent. While such advances have contributed to our current understanding of the causes of most cases of FALS and their underlying pathophysiological consequences, they only explain a small fraction of SALS with the etiology of most SALS cases remaining unexplained. Here, we review past and current methods used for the identification of FALS and SALS associated genes and propose a risk-based classification for these. We also discuss how the growing number of whole exome/genome sequencing datasets prepared from SALS cases, and control individuals, may reveal novel insights into the genetic etiology of SALS; for instance through revealing increased mutation burden rates across genes or genomic regions that were not previously associated with ALS or through allowing the examination of a potential "oligogenic" mechanism of the disease. Finally we summarize the three most recently discovered 'high risk' genes in ALS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To explore validity, results were compared to findings on tests of memory, mental flexibility, confrontation naming, semantic and letter category naming, verbal reasoning, and to scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The relationship to outcome as measured with the Disability Rating Scale (DRS), the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E), length of stay, and discharge destinations was also determined. Patients with severe TBI performed significantly worse than mild and moderate groups (chi(2)(KW2df) = 24.435, p = .0001). The total D-MEC score correlated significantly with all cognitive and language measures (p < .05). It also had a significant moderate correlation with the DRS total score (r - -.6090, p < .0001) and the GOS-E score (r = .539, p < .0001), indicating that better performance on conversational discourse was associated with a lower disability rating and better global outcome. Finally, the total D-MEC score was significantly different between the discharge destination groups (F-(3,F-90) = 20.19, p < .0001). Thus, early identification of conversational discourse impairment in acute care post-TBI was possible with the D-MEC and could allow for early intervention in speech-language pathology.

J	Mortada, MA; Yacout, S; Lakis, A				Mortada, Mohamad-Ali; Yacout, Soumaya; Lakis, Aouni			Fault diagnosis in power transformers using multi-class logical analysis of data	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Logical analysis of data; Multi-class decision model; Fault diagnosis; Mixed 0-1 integer and linear programming; Condition based maintenance	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; LOCALIZED DEFECTS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEM; MACHINE; SCHEME; TIME	This paper presents the implementation of a novel multi-class diagnostic technique for the detection and identification of faults based on an approach called logical analysis of data (LAD). LAD is a datamining, artificial intelligence approach that is based on pattern recognition. In the context of condition based maintenance (CBM), historical data containing condition indices and the state of the machine are the inputs to LAD. After training and testing phases, LAD generates patterns that characterize the faulty states according to the type of fault, and differentiate between these states and the normal state. These patterns are found by solving a mixed 0-1 integer linear programming problem. They are then used to detect and to identify a future unknown state of equipment. The diagnostic technique has already been tested on several known machine learning datasets. The results proved that the performance of this technique is comparable to other conventional approaches, such as neural network and support vector machine, with the added advantage of the clear interpretability of the generated patterns, which are rules characterizing the faults' types. To demonstrate its merit in fault diagnosis, the technique is used in the detection and identification of faults in power transformers using dissolved gas analysis data. The paper reaches the conclusion that the multi-class LAD based fault detection and identification is a promising diagnostic approach in CBM.

J	Verma, T; Cohen-Adad, J				Verma, Tanya; Cohen-Adad, Julien			Effect of Respiration on the B-0 Field in the Human Spinal Cord at 3T	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						field map; respiration; spinal cord; magnetic susceptibility; shimming	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; HUMAN BRAIN; 7 T; IN-VIVO; ARTIFACTS; RESPONSES; TESLA; MAPS; FMRI	PurposeRespiration affects the bulk magnetic susceptibility, causing frequency shifts as shown in the brain at 7T. Due to the close proximity of the spine to the lungs, this effect is expected to be even larger in the spinal cord, resulting in detrimental B-0 offset. The goal of this study was to quantify the effect of respiration on B-0 variation in the spinal cord. MethodsSeven healthy subjects were scanned at 3T. Field maps were acquired during inspired and expired conditions. Frequency shift was quantified in the brain, brainstem, and cervico-thoracic spinal cord. A skewed Gaussian function with linear term was fitted to the frequency shift as a function of z-location along the spine. ResultsLarge frequency shifts were measured along the cord, with a maximum of 74 Hz at C7 (P<0.05), corresponding to 0.58 ppm. The proposed model was adequately fitted to the respiratory-induced frequency-shifts (adjusted R-2=0.9954). The morphology of subjects (weight and height) seemed to have an impact on the amplitude of frequency shift, although correlations were not significant. ConclusionsThis study provides a deeper understanding of the contribution of respiration to B-0 shift in the spinal cord. The proposed model can be useful for designing future hardware or software strategies to compensate for these B-0 variations dynamically. Magn Reson Med 72:1629-1636, 2014.

Economic burden of brain metastases among patients with metastatic melanoma in a USA managed care population	MELANOMA RESEARCH			English	Article						brain metastases; healthcare costs; healthcare resource utilization; metastatic melanoma	SURVIVAL	Malignant melanoma patients frequently relapse with metastases in the brain, making it the third most common cancer-causing brain metastases in the USA. Management of brain metastases remains challenging because of the rapid progression of disease and ineffectiveness of conventional therapies. This retrospective study, with a pre/post' design, quantifies the economic burden of brain metastases among melanoma patients in the USA. A large managed-care insurance claims database (2000 Q1-2011 Q3) was used to identify patients with melanoma and brain metastases. The preperiod was defined as the 6 months before the index date (diagnosis of first observed brain metastases) and postperiod as the period following the index date up to 12 months. All-cause and brain metastasis-related healthcare resource utilization and healthcare costs were compared on a per-patient-per-month (PPPM) basis between preperiods and postperiods. The study included 6076 patients (mean age 63.4 years); 57.6% were men. Significant differences (P<0.0001) were observed between the postperiods and preperiods in the mean all-cause and brain metastasis-related PPPM hospitalizations and emergency department and outpatient visits. Significant postperiod versus preperiod differences were also observed in the PPPM mean (standard error) all-cause healthcare costs [total: $14489 ($231) vs. $7277 ($116); inpatient: $6330 ($195) vs. $1900 ($69); outpatient: $6609 ($102) vs. $4449 ($79); P<0.0001 for all] and brain metastasis-related costs [total: $6542 ($145) vs. $1933 ($62); inpatient: $2976 ($118) vs. $472 ($39); outpatient: $3451 ($76) vs. $1413 ($47); P<0.0001 for all]. Radiotherapy was the most common treatment. The economic burden associated with brain metastases in melanoma is significant and underscores the need for newer therapies to improve outcomes in these patients.

Impaired Adrenergic-Mediated Plasticity of Prefrontal Cortical Glutamate Synapses in Rats with Developmental Disruption of the Ventral Hippocampus	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; CONDITIONED FEAR EXTINCTION; AMPA RECEPTOR ENDOCYTOSIS; NORADRENERGIC MODULATION; BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY; SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; LOCUS-COERULEUS; CORTEX; NEURONS	Neonatal ventral hippocampus (nVH) lesion in rats is a useful model to study developmental origins of adult cognitive deficits and certain features of schizophrenia. nVH lesion-induced reorganization of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmissions within prefrontal cortical (PFC) circuits is widely believed to be responsible for many of the behavioral abnormalities in these animals. Here we provide evidence that development of an aberrant medial PFC (mPFC) alpha-I adrenergic receptor (alpha-IAR) function following neonatal lesion markedly affects glutamatergic synaptic plasticity within PFC microcircuits and contributes to PFC-related behavior abnormalities. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording, we report that norepinephrine-induced alpha-IAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) in a subset of cortico-cortical glutamatergic inputs is strikingly diminished in mPFC slices from nVH-lesioned rats. The LTD impairment occurs in conjunction with completely blunted alpha-IAR signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. These alpha-IAR abnormalities have functional significance in a mPFC-related function, that is, extinction of conditioned fear memory. Post-pubertal animals with nVH lesion show significant resistance to extinction of fear by repeated presentations of the conditioned tone stimulus. mPFC infusion of an alpha-IAR antagonist (benoxathian) or LTD blocking peptide (Tat-GluR2(3 gamma)) impaired fear extinction in sham controls, but had no significant effect in the lesioned animals. The data suggest that impaired alpha-I adrenergic regulation of cortical glutamatergic synaptic plasticity may be an important mechanism in cognitive dysfunctions reported in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders.

This strain carries a mutation in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NO, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in NADPH production, which has been suggested to lead to glucose intolerance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, recent reports comparing BI/6J to BI/6N (carrying the wild-type Nnt allele) under normal diet have led to conflicting results using glucose tolerance tests. Thus, we assessed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), insulin sensitivity, clearance and central glucose-induced insulin secretion in BI/6J and N mice using gold-standard methodologies. Methods: GSIS was measured using complementary tests (oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests) and hyperglycemic clamps. Whole body insulin sensitivity was assessed using euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps. Neurally-mediated insulin secretion was measured during central hyperglycemia. Results: BI/6J mice have impaired GSIS compared to BI/6N when glucose is administered intravenously during both a tolerance test and hyperglycemic clamp, but not in response to oral glucose. First and second phases of GSIS are altered without changes in whole body insulin sensitivity, insulin clearance, beta-cell mass or central response to glucose, thereby demonstrating defective beta-cell function in BI/6J mice. Conclusions: The BI/6J mouse strain displays impaired insulin secretion. These results have important implications for choosing the appropriate test to assess beta-cell function and background strain in genetically modified mouse models.

The ketamine effect on intracranial pressure in nontraumatic neurological illness	JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Ketamine; ICP; Intracranial pressure; Neurological illness	CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID PRESSURE; ANESTHESIA; GRADE; RECOMMENDATIONS; HYPERTENSION; CHILDREN; QUALITY; INJURY	Purpose: The purpose of the study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the use of ketamine in nontraumatic neurological illness and its effects on intracranial pressure (ICP). Materials and methods: Articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, HealthStar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to January 2014), and gray literature were searched. Two reviewers identified manuscripts on the administration of ketamine in nontraumatic neurological illness that recorded effects on ICP. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using the Oxford and Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Education (GRADE) methodology. Results: Our search produced a total of 179 citations. Sixteen articles, 15 manuscripts, and 1 meeting proceeding were included in the review. Across all studies, there were 127 adult and 87 pediatric patients described. Intracranial pressure did not increase in any of the adult studies reporting premedication during ketamine administration, with 2 studies reporting a decrease in ICP. No significant non-ICP-related adverse events from ketamine were recorded in any of the studies. Conclusions: There exists Oxford level 2b, GRADE C evidence in adults and level 4, GRADE C in pediatrics to support that ketamine does not increase ICP in nontraumatic neurological illness when patients are sedated and ventilated, and in fact may lower it in selected cases.

Adaptive ensembles for face recognition in changing video surveillance environments	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Multi-classifier system; Incremental learning; Adaptive biometric; Change detection; Face recognition; Video surveillance	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFIER ENSEMBLES; FUZZY ARTMAP; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM; RULE	Recognizing faces corresponding to target individuals remains a challenging problem in video surveillance. Face recognition (FR) systems are exposed to videos captured under various operating conditions, and, since data distributions change over time, face captures diverge w.r.t. stored facial models. Although these models may be adapted when new reference videos become available, incremental learning with faces captured under different conditions may lead to knowledge corruption. This paper presents an adaptive multi-classifier system (AMCS) for video-to-video FR in changing surveillance environments. During enrolment, faces captured in reference videos are employed to design an individual-specific classifier. During operations, a tracker allows to regroup facial captures for individuals in the scene, and accumulate the predictions per track for robust spatiotemporal FR. Given a new reference video, the corresponding facial model is adapted according to the type of concept change. If a gradual pattern of change is detected, the individual-specific classifier(s) are adapted through incremental learning. To preserve knowledge, another classifier is learned and combined with the individuals previously-trained classifier(s) if an abrupt change is detected. For proof-of-concept, the performance of a particular implementation of this AMCS is assessed using videos from the Faces in Action dataset. By adapting facial models according to changes detected in new reference videos, this AMCS allows to sustain a high level of accuracy comparable to the same system that is always updated using a learn-and-combine approach, while reducing time and memory complexity. It also provides higher accuracy than incremental learning classifiers that suffer the effects of knowledge corruption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A comprehensive model of development on the balance-scale task	COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Cognitive development; Balance scale; Constructive neural networks; Knowledge-based learning; KBCC; SDCC	LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS; ANALYZING COGNITIVE CHANGE; OF-FIT TEST; PSYCHOLOGICAL-DEVELOPMENT; CONNECTIONIST MODEL; GUIDING PRINCIPLES; TACIT KNOWLEDGE; RULE USE; STRATEGIES; IMPLICIT	We present a new model of children's performance on the balance-scale task, one of the most common benchmarks for computational modeling of psychological development. The model is based on intuitive and torque-rule modules, each implemented as a constructive neural network. While the intuitive module recruits non-linear sigmoid units as it learns to solve the task, the second module can additionally recruit a neurally-implemented torque rule, mimicking the explicit teaching of torque in secondary-school science classrooms. A third, selection module decides whether the intuitive module is likely to yield a correct response or whether the torque-rule module should be invoked on a given balance-scale problem. The model progresses through all four stages seen in children, ending with a genuine torque rule that can solve untrained problems that are only solvable by comparing torques. The model also simulates the torque-difference effect and the pattern of human response times, faster on simple problems than on conflict problems. The torque rule is more likely to be invoked on conflict problems than on simple problems and its emergence requires both explicit teaching and practice. Overlapping waves of rule-based stages are also covered by the model. Appendices report evidence that constructive neural networks can also acquire a genuine torque rule from examples alone and show that Latent Class Analysis often finds small, unreliable rule classes in both children and computational models. Consequently, caution in using Latent Class Analysis for rule diagnosis is suggested to avoid emphasis on rule classes that cannot be replicated. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Treatable inborn errors of metabolism presenting as cerebral palsy mimics: systematic literature review	ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES			English	Review						Inherited metabolic diseases; Therapy; Diagnosis; Atypical cerebral palsy; Movement disorders	SEMIALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE-DEFICIENCY; DOPA-RESPONSIVE DYSTONIA; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; CHILDREN; CLASSIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PHENOTYPE; NEUROLOGY	Background: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) have been anecdotally reported in the literature as presenting with features of cerebral palsy (CP) or misdiagnosed as 'atypical CP'. A significant proportion is amenable to treatment either directly targeting the underlying pathophysiology (often with improvement of symptoms) or with the potential to halt disease progression and prevent/minimize further damage. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review to identify all reports of IEMs presenting with CP-like symptoms before 5 years of age, and selected those for which evidence for effective treatment exists. Results: We identified 54 treatable IEMs reported to mimic CP, belonging to 13 different biochemical categories. A further 13 treatable IEMs were included, which can present with CP-like symptoms according to expert opinion, but for which no reports in the literature were identified. For 26 of these IEMs, a treatment is available that targets the primary underlying pathophysiology (e. g. neurotransmitter supplements), and for the remainder (n = 41) treatment exerts stabilizing/preventative effects (e. g. emergency regimen). The total number of treatments is 50, and evidence varies for the various treatments from Level 1b, c (n = 2); Level 2a, b, c (n = 16); Level 4 (n = 35); to Level 4-5 (n = 6); Level 5 (n = 8). Thirty-eight (57%) of the treatable IEMs mimicking CP can be identified by ready available metabolic screening tests in blood or urine, while the remaining IEMs require more specific and sometimes invasive tests. Conclusions: Limited by the rare nature of IEMs and incomplete information in the literature, we conclude that (1) A surprisingly large number of IEMs can present with CP symptoms, as 'CP mimics', (2) although individually rare, a large proportion of these diseases are treatable such that neurological damage can either be reversed or prevented, (3) clinician awareness of treatable CP mimics is important for appropriate screening, diagnosis, and early intervention, and (4) systematic studies are required to elucidate the collective frequency of treatable IEMs in CP.

Here, we investigate the limitations and prospects of AC. For non-ideal and semioptimal AC, we study the impact of finite relaxation times of reset and computation spins on the achievable effective cooling. We derive, via simulations, the attainable cooling levels for given ratios of relaxation times using two semioptimal practicable algorithms. We expect this analysis to be valuable for the planning of future experiments. For ideal and optimal AC, we make use of lower bounds on the number of required reset steps, based on entropy considerations, to present important consequences of using AC as a tool for improving signal-to-noise ratio in liquid-state magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition to the analysis of limitations, we also discuss prospective bio-medical applications; in particular, we discuss the potential use of AC for non-invasive clinical diagnosis and drug monitoring, where it may have significantly lower specific absorption rate (SAR) with respect to currently used methods.

Real-time modulation of perceptual eye dominance in humans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						ocular dominance; perceptual eye dominance; neural plasticity; low-pass; nature movies; movie-watching	STRIATE CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; RECEPTIVE FIELDS; ADULT; PLASTICITY; AMBLYOPIA; VISION; BRAIN	Ocular dominance (OD) has long served as the model for neural plasticity. The shift of OD has been demonstrated by monocular deprivation in animals only during early visual development. Here, for the first time, we show that perceptual eye dominance can be modulated in real time in normal human adults by varying the spatial image content of movies seen dichoptically by the two eyes over a period as short as 2.5 h. Unlike OD shifts seen in early visual development, this modulation in human eye dominance is not simply a consequence of reduced interocular correlation (e. g. synchronicity) or overall contrast energy, but due to the amplitude reductions of specific image components in one eye's view. The spatial properties driving this eye dominance change suggest that the underlying mechanism is binocular but not orientationally selective, therefore uniquely locating it to layer 4 B of area V1.

Application to the coregistration of MR and SPECT images in neuro-oncology	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						evaluation of registration methods; multimodality image registration; brain gliomas	MUTUAL INFORMATION; BRAIN-TUMORS; RECURRENT; CHEMOTHERAPY; MAXIMIZATION; TOMOGRAPHY; ALGORITHM; ALIGNMENT; THERAPY; GLIOMA	An efficient registration strategy is described that aims to help solve delicate medical imaging registration problems. It consists of running several registration methods for each dataset and selecting the best one for each specific dataset, according to an evaluation criterion. Finally, the quality of the registration results, obtained with the best method, is visually scored by an expert as excellent, correct or poor. The strategy was applied to coregister Technetium-99m Sestamibi SPECT and MRI data in the framework of a follow-up protocol in patients with high grade gliomas receiving antiangiogenic therapy. To adapt the strategy to this clinical context, a robust semi-automatic evaluation criterion based on the physiological uptake of the Sestamibi tracer was defined. A panel of eighteen multimodal registration algorithms issued from BrainVisa, SPM or AIR software environments was systematically applied to the clinical database composed of sixty-two datasets. According to the expert visual validation, this new strategy provides 85% excellent registrations, 12% correct ones and only 3% poor ones. These results compare favorably to the ones obtained by the globally most efficient registration method over the whole database, for which only 61% of excellent registration results have been reported. Thus the registration strategy in its current implementation proves to be suitable for clinical application.

BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Participants' protection; Institutional review boards; Next generation sequencing; Secondary use; Recontacting participants; Data sharing; Genetic research; Informed consent; Vulnerable populations; Mental health; Brain disorders	INFORMED-CONSENT; PARTICIPANTS; BROKEN	Background: In order to ensure an adequate and ongoing protection of individuals participating in scientific research, the impacts of new biomedical technologies, such as Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), need to be assessed. In this light, a necessary reexamination of the ethical and legal structures framing research could lead to requisite changes in informed consent modalities. This would have implications for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), who bear the responsibility of guaranteeing that participants are verifiably informed, and in sufficient detail, to understand the reality of genetic research as it is practiced now. Current literature allowed the identification of key emergent themes related to the consent process when NGS was used in a research setting. Methods: We examined the subjects of secondary use, sharing of materials and data, and recontacting participants as outlined in the Canadian Informed Consent templates and the accompanying IRB instructions for the conduct of genetic research. The research ethics policy applied by the three Canadian research agencies (Tri-Council Policy Statement, 2nd Edition) was used to frame our content analysis. We also obtained IRB-approved consent forms for genetic research projects on brain and mental health disorders as an example of a setting where participants might present higher-than-average vulnerability. Results: Eighty percent of documents addressed different modalities for the secondary use of material and/or data, although the message was not conveyed in a systematic way. Information on the sharing of genetic sequencing data in a manner completely independent of the material from which it originated was absent. Grounds for recontacting participants were limited, and mainly mentioned to obtain consent for secondary use. A feature of the IRB-approved consent documents for genetic studies on brain and mental health disorders using NGS technologies, offered a complete explanation on sharing material and data and the use of databases. Conclusions: The results of our work show that in Canada, many NGS research needs are already dealt with. Our analysis led us to propose the addition of well-defined categories for future use, adding options on the sharing of genetic data, and widening the grounds on which research participants could consent to be recontacted.

FXR1P Limits Long-Term Memory, Long-Lasting Synaptic Potentiation, and De Novo GluA2 Translation	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; AMPA RECEPTORS; MOUSE MODEL; MENTAL-RETARDATION; MESSENGER-RNAS; PLASTICITY; SUBUNIT; TRAFFICKING; EXPRESSION	Translational control of mRNAs allows for rapid and selective changes in synaptic protein expression that are required for long-lasting plasticity and memory formation in the brain. Fragile X Related Protein 1 (FXR1P) is an RNA-binding protein that controls mRNA translation in nonneuronal cells and colocalizes with translational machinery in neurons. However, its neuronal mRNA targets and role in the brain are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that removal of FXR1P from the forebrain of postnatal mice selectively enhances long-term storage of spatial memories, hippocampal late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP), and de novo GluA2 synthesis. Furthermore, FXR1P binds specifically to the 5' UTR of GluA2 mRNA to repress translation and limit the amount of GluA2 that is incorporated at potentiated synapses.

Methods: We performed a multinational cross-sectional observational study of the clinical, radiologic, and molecular characteristics of 105 mutation-proven cases. Results: The majority of patients presented before 6 years with gross motor delay or regression. Ten percent had an onset beyond 10 years. The disease course was milder in patients with POLR3B than in patients with POLR3A mutations. Other than the typical neurologic, dental, and endocrine features, myopia was seen in almost all and short stature in 50%. Dental and hormonal findings were not invariably present. Mutations in POLR3A and POLR3B were distributed throughout the genes. Except for French Canadian patients, patients from European backgrounds were more likely to have POLR3B mutations than other populations. Most patients carried the common c. 1568T>A POLR3B mutation on one allele, homozygosity for which causes a mild phenotype. Systematic MRI review revealed that the combination of hypomyelination with relative T2 hypointensity of the ventrolateral thalamus, optic radiation, globus pallidus, and dentate nucleus, cerebellar atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum suggests the diagnosis. Conclusions: 4H is a well-recognizable clinical entity if all features are present. Mutations in POLR3A are associated with a more severe clinical course. MRI characteristics are helpful in addressing the diagnosis, especially if patients lack the cardinal non-neurologic features.

Last generation high-resolution PET cameras with a full width at half maximum(FWHM) of 2-4 mm are less prone to PVEs than previous generations. Corrections for PVEs are still necessary, especially when studying small brain stem nuclei or small variations in cortical neuroreceptor concentrations which may be related to cytoarchitectonic differences. Although several partial-volumecorrection (PVC) algorithms exist, these are frequently based on a priori assumptions about tracer distribution or only yield corrected values of regional activity concentrations without providing PVE corrected images. We developed a newiterative deconvolution algorithm(idSURF) for PVC of PET images that aims to overcome these limitations by using two innovative techniques: 1) the incorporation of anatomic information from a cortical gray matter surface representation, extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 2) the use of anatomically constrained filtering to attenuate noise. PVE corrected images were generated with idSURF implemented into a non-interactive processing pipeline. idSURF was validated using simulated and clinical PET data sets and compared to a frequently used standard PVC method (Geometric Transfer Matrix: GTM). The results on simulated data sets show that idSURF consistently recovers accurate radiotracer concentrations within 1-5% of true values. Both radiotracer concentrations and non-displaceable binding potential (BPnd) values derived from clinical PET data sets with idSURF were highly correlated with those obtained with the standard PVC method (R-2=0.99, error=0%-3.2%). These results suggest that idSURF is a valid and potentially clinically useful PVC method for automatic processing of large numbers of PET data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Framework for integrated MRI average of the spinal cord white and gray matter: The MNI-Poly-AMU template	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Spinal cord; MRI; Template; Group analysis; Registration	OF-THE-ART; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; IN-VIVO; MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; SPATIAL NORMALIZATION; MOTION CORRECTION; 7 T; SEGMENTATION; ATROPHY; IMAGES	The field of spinal cord MRI is lacking a common template, as existing for the brain, which would allow extraction of multi-parametric data (diffusion-weighted, magnetization transfer, etc.) without user bias, thereby facilitating group analysis and multi-center studies. This paper describes a framework to produce an unbiased average anatomical template of the human spinal cord. The template was created by co-registering T2-weighted images (N=16 healthy volunteers) using a series of pre-processing steps followed by non-linear registration. A white and gray matter probabilistic template was then merged to the average anatomical template, yielding the MNI-Poly-AMU template, which currently covers vertebral levels C1 to T6. New subjects can be registered to the template using a dedicated image processing pipeline. Validation was conducted on 16 additional subjects by comparing an automatic template-based segmentation and manual segmentation, yielding amedian Dice coefficient of 0.89. The registration pipeline is rapid (similar to 15 min), automatic after one C2/C3 landmark manual identification, and robust, thereby reducing subjective variability and bias associated with manual segmentation. The template can notably be used for measurements of spinal cord cross-sectional area, voxel-based morphometry, identification of anatomical features (e. g., vertebral levels, white and gray matter location) and unbiased extraction of multi-parametric data.

If such were the case, we expected that microstimulation within the pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF) would evoke qualitatively similar responses in muscles active during both behaviors. To test this, we stimulated in 47 sites within the PMRF during both tasks. Stimulation during locomotion always produced a strongly phase-dependent, bilateral pattern of activity in which activity in muscles was generally facilitated or suppressed during one phase of activity (swing or stance) and was unaffected in the other. During reaching, stimulation generally activated the same muscles as during locomotion, although the modulation of the magnitude of the evoked responses was less limb dependent than during locomotion. An exception was found for some forelimb flexor muscles that were strongly facilitated by stimulation during the swing phase of locomotion but were not influenced by stimulation during the transport phase of the reach. We suggest that during locomotion the activity in interneuronal pathways mediating signals from the reticulospinal system is subject to strong modulation by the central pattern generator for locomotion. During reach, we suggest that, for most muscles, the same spinal interneuronal pathways are used to modify muscle activity but are not as strongly gated according to limb use as during locomotion. Finally, we propose that the command for movement during discrete voluntary movements suppresses the influence of the reticulospinal system on selected forelimb flexor muscles, possibly to enhance fractionated control of movement.

Since TF is upregulated by oncogenic mutations occurring in different subsets of human brain tumors we investigated whether TF contributes to tumourigenesis driven by oncogenic activation of EGFR (EGFRvIII) and RAS pathways in the brain. Here we show that TF expression correlates with poor prognosis in glioma, but not in GBM. In situ, the TF protein expression is heterogeneously expressed in adult and pediatric gliomas. GBM cells harboring EGFRvIII (U373vIII) grow aggressively as xenografts in SCID mice and their progression is delayed by administration of monoclonal antibodies blocking coagulant (CNTO 859) and signlaing (10H10) effects of TF in vivo. Mice in which TF gene is disrupted in the neuroectodermal lineage exhibit delayed progression of spontaneous brain tumors driven by oncogenic N-ras and SV40 large T antigen (SV40LT) expressed under the control of sleeping beauty transposase. Reduced host TF levels in low-TF/SCID hypomorphic mice mitigated growth of glioma subcutaneously but not in the brain. Thus, we suggest that tumor-associated TF may serve as therapeutic target in the context of oncogene-driven disease progression in a subset of glioma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The thalamus contributes to a range of basic cognitive behaviors that include learning and memory, inhibitory control, decision-making, and the control of visual orienting responses. Its functions are deeply intertwined with those of the better studied cortex, although the principles governing its coordination with the cortex remain opaque, particularly in higher-level aspects of cognition. How should the thalamus be viewed in the context of the rest of the brain? Although its role extends well beyond relaying of sensory information from the periphery, the main function of many of its subdivisions does appear to be that of a relay station, transmitting neural signals primarily to the cerebral cortex from a number of brain areas. In cognition, its main contribution may thus be to coordinate signals between diverse regions of the telencephalon, including the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum. This central coordination is further subject to considerable extrinsic control, for example, inhibition from the basal ganglia, zona incerta, and pretectal regions, and chemical modulation from ascending neurotransmitter systems.

The aim of this study was to investigate if aged monkeys exhibiting spatial memory impairment and levels of biomarkers indicative of AD, had brain lesions similar to human patients suffering from senile dementia. Generating immunohistochemistry technique to biomarkers of amyloid beta(1-42) and the phosphorylated tau 231, our study assessed the amyloidopathy, such as indicative to the senile plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and the tauopathy, to possible neurofibrillary tangles. Six aged monkeys were selected based on their spatial memory performance and profile of biomarkers of AD, divided equally to affected aged subject with Memory-affected and low amyloid level, and aged with higher performance in memory and amyloid, as the age-matched subjects. Using immunohistochemistry, plaques of amyloid beta(1-42) were observed in two out of three brains of aged subjects with memory impairment and biomarkers indicative of AD. The cerebral amyloid angiopathy was observed in both aged monkey groups, and unlike in the human, the amyloids were found to deposit in the small veins and capillaries. In one of the affected individuals, phosphorylated tau was positively stained intracellularly of the neurons, indicating a possibility of an early stage of the formation of tangles. These findings add to the body of evidence of the utility of the aged cynomolgus monkeys as a spontaneous model for Alzheimer-related disease.

The contribution of alpha beta-tubulin curvature to microtubule dynamics	JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY			English	Review							PLUS-END-TRACKING; KINESIN-RELATED PROTEIN; CENTROMERE-ASSOCIATED KINESIN; SELF-ASSEMBLY KINETICS; YEAST MITOTIC SPINDLE; STATHMIN-LIKE DOMAIN; STRUCTURAL BASIS; NDC80 COMPLEX; IN-VITRO; DOUBLECORTIN RECOGNIZES	Microtubules are dynamic polymers of alpha beta-tubulin that form diverse cellular structures, such as the mitotic spindle for cell division, the backbone of neurons, and axonemes. To control the architecture of microtubule networks, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and motor proteins regulate microtubule growth, shrinkage, and the transitions between these states. Recent evidence shows that many MAPs exert their effects by selectively binding to distinct conformations of polymerized or unpolymerized alpha beta-tubulin. The ability of alpha beta-tubulin to adopt distinct conformations contributes to the intrinsic polymerization dynamics of microtubules. alpha beta-Tubulin conformation is a fundamental property that MAPs monitor and control to build proper microtubule networks.

The antibody-drug conjugate glembatumumab vedotin consists of a fully human anti-gpNMB monoclonal antibody, conjugated via a cleavable linker to monomethyl auristatin E. Glembatumumab vedotin is generally well tolerated, with observed objective responses in advanced melanoma. This is, to our knowledge, the first study of glembatumumab vedotin in breast cancer. Patients and Methods Eligible patients had advanced/metastatic breast cancer with at least two prior chemotherapy regimens, including taxane, anthracycline, and capecitabine. A standard 3+3 dose escalation was followed by a phase II expansion. Immunohistochemistry for gpNMB was performed retrospectively for patients with available tumor tissue. Results Forty-two patients were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) consisted of worsening neuropathy at 1.34 mg/kg. After excluding patients with baseline neuropathy more than grade 1, no DLT occurred through 1.88 mg/kg (the phase II dose). The phase II primary activity end point was met (12-week progression-free survival [PFS12] -9 of 27 patients; 33%). Sixteen of 19 (84%) patients tested had gpNMB-positive tumors. At the phase II dose, median PFS was 9.1 weeks for all patients, 17.9 weeks for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and 18.0 weeks for patients with gpNMB-positive tumors. Two patients had confirmed partial responses; both had gpNMB-positive tumors and one had TNBC. Conclusion Glembatumumab vedotin has an acceptable safety profile. Preliminary evidence of activity in treatment-resistant metastatic breast cancer requires confirmation, such as the phase II randomized trial (EMERGE) that also examines the relationship between activity and gpNMB distribution/intensity.

However, to date, no measures of functional connectivity measured within the first 2 years have specifically associated with a later ASD diagnosis. Methods: In the present study, we analyzed functional brain connectivity in 14-month-old infants at high and low familial risk for ASD using electroencephalography (EEG). EEG was recorded while infants attended to videos. Connectivity was assessed using debiased weighted phase lag index (dbWPLI). At 36 months, the high-risk infants were assessed for symptoms of ASD. Results: As a group, high-risk infants who were later diagnosed with ASD demonstrated elevated phase-lagged alpha-range connectivity as compared to both low-risk infants and high-risk infants who did not go on to ASD. Hyper-connectivity was most prominent over frontal and central areas. The degree of hyper-connectivity at 14 months strongly correlated with the severity of restricted and repetitive behaviors in participants with ASD at 3 years. These effects were not attributable to differences in behavior during the EEG session or to differences in spectral power. Conclusions: The results suggest that early hyper-connectivity in the alpha frequency range is an important feature of the ASD neurophysiological phenotype.	[Orekhova, Elena V.; Jones, Emily J.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of an aggressive treatment approach used in our institution for the last eight years. Methods: Data from all patients with PC arising from the appendix were prospectively collected and analyzed. Treatment consisted of complete surgical cytoreduction (CRS), followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with oxaliplatin (460 mg/m(2)) at 43 degrees C over 30 minutes. Ronnett's histologic classification was used for tumor grading. Results: Between February 2003 and April 2011, 78 patients underwent laparotomy with curative intent. The mean follow-up period was 33.7 months. A total of 58 patients received HIPEC, but 11 patients could not have CRS and received no HIPEC. Nine patients with a negative second-look surgery also received no HIPEC. The five-year overall survival for the entire cohort was 66.2%; 100% for the negative second-look patients, 77% for the HIPEC patients and 9% for the unresectable patients (P <0.0001). A total of 15 patients (25.9%) had isolated peritoneal recurrence, no patient had visceral recurrence only, and five patients (8.6%) had both. In regards to the five-year disease-free survival for the HIPEC patients, histologic grade (disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis 100%, peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis with intermediate features 40%, peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis 20%; p = 0.0016) and completeness of cytoreduction (CCR-0 56%, CCR-1 24%; P = 0.0172) were prognostic factors. There was one postoperative mortality. The major complication rate for patients treated with HIPEC was 40%, including intra-abdominal abcess (17%), hemorrhage (12%) and anastomotic leak (10%). One patient in the HIPEC group experienced temporary grade II neuropathy and grade III thrombocytopenia. Conclusions: This therapeutic approach seems both feasible and safe in selected patients. Recurrence is, however, frequent and represents a challenge.

Early blindness induces cross-modal plastic modifications in the brain such as auditory and haptic activations of the visual cortex and also leads to a greater solicitation of the somatosensory and auditory cortices. The visual cortex is activated by auditory stimuli in anophthalmic mice and activity is known to alter the growth pattern of the cerebral cortex. The size of the primary visual, auditory and somatosensory cortices and of the corresponding specific sensory thalamic nuclei were measured in intact and enucleated C57Bl/6J mice and in ZRDCT anophthalmic mice (ZRDCT/An) to evaluate the contribution of cross-modal activity on the growth of the cerebral cortex. In addition, the size of these structures were compared in intact, enucleated and anophthalmic fourth generation backcrossed hybrid C57Bl/6J x ZRDCT/An mice to parse out the effects of mouse strains and of the different visual deprivations. The visual cortex was smaller in the anophthalmic ZRDCT/An than in the intact and enucleated C57Bl/6J mice. Also the auditory cortex was larger and the somatosensory cortex smaller in the ZRDCT/An than in the intact and enucleated C57Bl/6J mice. The size differences of sensory cortices between the enucleated and anophthalmic mice were no longer present in the hybrid mice, showing specific genetic differences between C57Bl/6J and ZRDCT mice. The post natal size increase of the visual cortex was less in the enucleated than in the anophthalmic and intact hybrid mice. This suggests differences in the activity of the visual cortex between enucleated and anophthalmic mice, and that early in-utero spontaneous neural activity in the visual system contributes to the shaping of functional properties of cortical networks.

Twenty normal controls (NC), 19 mild (MP) and 17 severe (SP) POAG patients were recruited and scanned using magnetic resonance imaging. Multi-parameter morphologic analyses with regions of interest (V5/MT+, anterior and posterior subregions of V1 and V2) were used to assess the cortical changes among the three groups. Compared with the NC group, decreased cortical thickness was detected in the V5/MT+ area in the MP group and in all of the investigated visual areas except the posterior subregion of V1 in the SP group. Unexpectedly, cortical thinning of the posterior subregion of V2 was detected in the SP group compared with the NC and MP groups. For the other morphologic parameters, only gray matter volume in the posterior subregion of V2 and mean curvature in the V5/MT+ were significantly changed in the SP group. In addition, the clinical measurements were positively correlated with the cortical thickness of the V5/MT+ and the posterior subregion of V2. In conclusion, the V5/MT+ area is involved in early disruption of POAG and the cortical degeneration may be progressive and heterogeneous in different visual cortices. Early neuroprotective therapies on the retina and central visual system may help to preserve vision in patients with POAG. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

NEURAL HO-1/STEROL INTERACTIONS IN VIVO: IMPLICATIONS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						astrocyte; Alzheimer's disease; cholesterol; heme oxygenase-1; lipid; oxysterol	HEME OXYGENASE-1 EXPRESSION; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CHOLESTEROL-METABOLISM; ATHEROSCLEROTIC LESIONS; ASTROCYTIC COMPARTMENT; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; BRAIN CHOLESTEROL; IRON DEPOSITION	Background: Up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and altered cholesterol (CH) metabolism are characteristic of Alzheimer-diseased (AD) neural tissues. We previously provided evidence of significant HO-1/sterol interactions in vitro (cultured rat astroglia) and in postmortem human AD brain (Religious Orders Study). Methods: The current experiments were designed to further delineate these interactions in vivo by comparing the behavior of HO-1/sterol interactions in two mouse models; (1) a novel HO-1 transgenic mouse (GFAP.HMOX1) engineered to selectively express human HO-1 in the astrocytic compartment and (2) the previously described triple transgenic AD mouse (3xTg-AD). In samples of frontal cortex, total CH, CH precursors and relevant oxysterols were quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and HO-1 protein expression was assessed by ELISA. The relationships of HO-1 expression to total CH, CH precursors and total oxysterols were determined for both mouse models using linear regression analysis. Results: HO-1 expression is increased in GFAP.HMOX1 mice relative to wild type and in 11-12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice (with AD-like phenotype) relative to control mice and 5-6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice (no AD-like phenotype). Total oxysterols significantly decreased as HO-1 expression increased in GFAP.HMOX1 mice expressing high levels of HO-1, whereas total oxysterols increased as HO-1 expression increased in aged 3xTg-AD mice. Total CH and total CH precursors increased as HO-1 protein expression increased in 11-12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice relative to 5-6-month old 3xTg-AD mice. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a differential impact of HO-1 on patterns of brain sterol and redox homeostasis that is contingent on the presence or absence of AD-like neuropathology. These data provide fresh insight concerning the regulation of sterol homeostasis within the aging and degenerating CNS which may inform the development of novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for the management of AD and related conditions.

Our results demonstrate that the endogenous cholinergic propriospinal system, acting via M-2 and M-3 muscarinic receptors, is capable of consistently producing well-coordinated locomotor activity in the in vitro neonatal preparation, placing it in a position to contribute to normal locomotion and to provide a basis for recovery of locomotor capability in the absence of descending pathways. Tests of these suggestions, however, reveal that the spinal cholinergic system plays little if any role in the induction of locomotion, because MLR-evoked locomotion in decerebrate cats is not prevented by cholinergic antagonists. Furthermore, it is not required for the development of stepping movements after spinal cord injury, because cholinergic agonists do not facilitate the appearance of locomotion after spinal cord injury, unlike the dramatic locomotion-promoting effects of clonidine, a noradrenergic alpha-2 agonist. Furthermore, cholinergic antagonists actually improve locomotor activity after spinal cord injury, suggesting that plastic changes in the spinal cholinergic system interfere with locomotion rather than facilitating it. Changes that have been observed in the cholinergic innervation of motoneurons after spinal cord injury do not decrease motoneuron excitability, as expected. Instead, the development of a "hyper-cholinergic" state after spinal cord injury appears to enhance motoneuron output and suppress locomotion. A cholinergic suppression of afferent input from the limb after spinal cord injury is also evident from our data, and this may contribute to the ability of cholinergic antagonists to improve locomotion. Not only is a role for the spinal cholinergic system in suppressing locomotion after SCI suggested by our results, but an obligatory contribution of a brainstem cholinergic relay to reticulospinal locomotor command systems is not confirmed by our experiments.

Herein, we compared sedative, opioid, and neuromuscular blocker (NMB) use among patients managed with the intervention and control strategies and clinicians' assessment of comfort in both groups. Methods: This was an observational substudy of the LOV Study, a randomized trial conducted in 30 intensive care units in Canada, Australia, and Saudi Arabia. In 16 centers, we recorded daily doses of sedatives, opioids, and NMBs and surveyed bedside clinicians about their own comfort with the assigned ventilator strategy and their perceptions of patient comfort. We compared characteristics and outcomes of patients who did and did not receive NMBs. Results: Study groups received similar sedative, opioid, and NMB dosing on days 1, 3, and 7. Patient comfort as assessed by clinicians was not different in the two groups: 93% perceived patients had no/minimal discomfort. In addition, 92% of clinicians were comfortable with the assigned ventilation strategy without significant differences between the two groups. When clinicians expressed discomfort, more expressed discomfort about PEEP levels in the intervention vs control group (2.9% vs 0.7%, P < 0.0001), and more perceived patient discomfort among controls (6.0% vs 4.3%, P = 0.049). On multivariable analysis, the strongest associations with NMB use were higher plateau pressure (hazard ratio (HR) 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.23; P = 0.0002) and higher daily sedative dose (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.05; P < 0.0001). Patients receiving NMBs had more barotrauma, longer durations of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, and higher mortality. Conclusions: In the LOV Study, high PEEP, low tidal volume ventilation did not increase sedative, opioid, or NMB doses in adults with ARDS, compared with a lower PEEP strategy, and appeared at least as comfortable for patients. NMB use may reflect worse lung injury, as these patients had more barotrauma, longer durations of ventilation, and higher mortality.

To assess molecular convergence, we generated human neural progenitor cell models of 9q34 deletion syndrome, caused by haploinsufficiency of EHMT1, and 18q21 deletion syndrome, caused by haploinsufficiency of TCF4. Using next-generation RNA sequencing, methylation sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and whole-genome miRNA analysis, we identified several levels of convergence. We found mRNA and miRNA expression patterns that were more characteristic of differentiating cells than of proliferating cells, and we identified CpG clusters that had similar methylation states in both models of reduced gene dosage. There was significant overlap of gene targets of TCF4 and EHMT1, whereby 8.3% of TCF4 gene targets and 4.2% of EHMT1 gene targets were identical. These data suggest that 18q21 and 9q34 deletion syndromes show significant molecular convergence but distinct expression and methylation profiles. Common intersection points might highlight the most salient features of disease and provide avenues for similar treatments for NDDs caused by different genetic mutations.

By contrast, here we focus on the particular challenges of embodied decision-making faced by animals interacting with their environment in real time. In such scenarios, the choices themselves as well as their relative costs and benefits are defined by the momentary geometry of the immediate environment and change continuously during ongoing activity. To deal with the demands of embodied activity, animals require an architecture in which the sensorimotor specification of potential actions, their valuation, selection and even execution can all take place in parallel. Here, we review behavioural and neurophysiological data supporting a proposed brain architecture for dealing with such scenarios, which we argue set the evolutionary foundation for the organization of the mammalian brain.

With technological improvements and increased operator experience, their incidence is markedly declining, justifying the need for surrogate endpoints to be used in future comparative trials. Moreover, imaging studies after TAVR and SAVR suggest that neurological events are mainly embolic in nature; however, there is significant discrepancy between imaging findings and clinically overt symptoms, raising the possibility of more subtle subclinical cognitive decline. Different modalities have been used to assess both overt and subclinical neurological events after SAVR and TAVR. The purpose of this report is to systematically review and describe currently used imaging, functional, and neurocognitive testing modalities and to better understand how they could be integrated in future prospective studies.

The molecular mechanisms regulating the regional organization and migration of the primordium involve interactions between Fgf and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and the establishment of specific cxcr4b and cxcr7b cytokine receptor expression domains. Itch has been identified as a regulator in several different signaling pathways, including Wnt and Cxcr4 signaling. We identified two homologous itch genes in zebrafish, itcha and itchb, with generalized expression patterns. By reducing itchb expression in particular upon morpholino knockdown, we demonstrated the importance of Itch in regulating lateral line development by perturbing the patterns of cxcr4b and cxcr7b expression. Itch knockdown results in a failure to down-regulate Wnt signaling and overexpression of cxcr4b in the primordium, slowing migration of the posterior lateral line primordium and resulting in abnormal development of the lateral line.

J	Martinu, K; Nagano-Saito, A; Fogel, S; Monchi, O				Martinu, Kristina; Nagano-Saito, Atsuko; Fogel, Stuart; Monchi, Oury			Asymmetrical Effect of Levodopa on the Neural Activity of Motor Regions in PD	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRIMATE BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; INTERNAL GENERATION; ANTERIOR STRIATUM; FINGER MOVEMENTS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FMRI; APOMORPHINE; ACTIVATION	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative illness often characterized by asymmetrical symptoms. However, the reason for this asymmetry and the cerebral correlates underlying symptom asymmetry are still not well understood. Furthermore, the effects of levodopa on the cerebral correlates of disease asymmetry have not been investigated. In this study, right-handed PD patients performed self-initiated, externally triggered and repetitive control finger movements with both their right and left hands during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate asymmetrical effects of levodopa on the hemodynamic correlates of finger movements. Patients completed two experimental sessions OFF and ON medication after a minimum of 12 hours medication withdrawal. We compared the effect of levodopa on the neural activation patterns underlying the execution of both the more affected and less affected hand for self-initiated and externally triggered movements. Our results show that levodopa led to larger differences in cerebral activity for movements of the more affected, left side: there were significant differences in activity after levodopa administration in regions of the motor cortico-striatal network when patients performed self-initiated and externally triggered movements with their left hand. By contrast, when patients used their right hand, levodopa led to differences in cerebellar activity only. As our patients were affected more severely on their left side, we propose that levodopa may help provide additional dopaminergic input, improving movements for the more severely affected side. These results suggest that the impact of reduced dopamine in the cortico-striatal system and the action of levodopa is not symmetrical.

J	Kingdom, FAA				Kingdom, Frederick A. A.			Mach bands explained by response normalization	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Mach bands; brightness illusions; response normalization; feature coding; multi-scale filtering	SIMULTANEOUS BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; HUMAN-VISION; INDUCTION; MODEL; GANGLION; RETINA; WHITE	Mach bands are the illusory dark and bright bars seen at the foot and knee of a luminance trapezoid. First demonstrated by Ernst Mach in the latter part of the 19th century, Mach bands are a test bed not only for models of brightness illusions but of spatial vision in general. Up until 50 years ago the dominant explanation of Mach Bands was that they were caused by lateral inhibition among retinal neurons. More recently, the dominant idea has been that Mach bands are a consequence of a visual process that generates a sparse, binary description of the image in terms of "edges" and "bars". Another recent explanation is that Mach bands result from learned expectations about the pattern of light typically found on sharply curved surfaces. In keeping with recent multi-scale filtering accounts of brightness illusions as well as current physiology, I show however that Mach bands are most simply explained by response normalization, whereby the gains of early visual channels are adjusted on a local basis to make their responses more equal. I show that a simple one-dimensional model of response normalization explains the range of conditions under which Mach bands occur, and as importantly, the conditions under which they do not occur.

Hippocampal and behavioral dysfunctions in a mouse model of environmental stress: normalization by agomelatine	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							CHRONIC MILD STRESS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTION; TRANSGENIC MICE; DEPRESSION; NEUROGENESIS; RECEPTORS; GENE; MELATONIN	Stress-induced alterations in neuronal plasticity and in hippocampal functions have been suggested to be involved in the development of mood disorders. In this context, we investigated in the hippocampus the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, the expression of epigenetic markers and plasticity-related genes in a mouse model of stress-induced hyperactivity and of mixed affective disorders. We also determined whether the antidepressant drug agomelatine, a MT1/MT2 melatonergic receptor agonist/5-HT2C receptor antagonist, could prevent some neurobiological and behavioral alterations produced by stress. C57BL/6J mice, exposed for 3 weeks to daily unpredictable socio-environmental stressors of mild intensity, were treated during the whole procedure with agomelatine (50 mg kg(-1) per day, intraperitoneal). Stressed mice displayed robust increases in emotional arousal, vigilance and motor activity, together with a reward deficit and a reduction in anxiety-like behavior. Neurobiological investigations showed an increased phosphorylation of intracellular signaling proteins, including Atf1, Creb and p38, in the hippocampus of stressed mice. Decreased hippocampal level of the repressive epigenetic marks HDAC2 and H3K9me2, as well as increased level of the permissive mark H3K9/14ac suggested that chronic mild stress was associated with increased gene transcription, and clear-cut evidence was further indicated by changes in neuroplasticity-related genes, including Arc, Bcl2, Bdnf, Gdnf, Igf1 and Neurod1. Together with other findings, the present data suggest that chronic ultra-mild stress can model the hyperactivity or psychomotor agitation, as well as the mixed affective behaviors often observed during the manic state of bipolar disorder patients. Interestingly, agomelatine could normalize both the behavioral and the molecular alterations induced by stress, providing further insights into the mechanism of action of this new generation antidepressant drug.

Much of what is known about the sequelae of mTBI is yielded from the adult literature, and it appears that it is mainly those with persistent post-injury symptoms who have ongoing cognitive and neural abnormalities. However, most studies have employed single-task paradigms, which may not be challenging enough to uncover subtle deficits. We sought to examine the neural correlates of dual-task performance in male athletes aged 9-15 years using a functional neuroimaging protocol. Participants included 13 youths with a history of mTBI three to six months prior to testing and 14 typically-developing controls. All participants completed a working memory task in isolation (single-task) and while completing a concurrent motor task (dual-task); neural activity during performance was then compared between groups. Although working memory performance was similar during the single-task condition, increased working memory load resulted in an altered pattern of neural activation in key working memory areas (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices) in youth with mTBI relative to controls. During the dual-task condition, accuracy was similar between groups but injured youth performed slower than typically-developing controls, suggesting a speed-accuracy tradeoff in the mTBI group only. The injured youths also exhibited abnormal recruitment of brain structures involved in both working memory and dual-tasking. These data show that the dual-task paradigm can uncover functional impairments in youth with mTBI who are not highly symptomatic and who do not exhibit neuropsychological dysfunction. Moreover, neural recruitment abnormalities were noted in both task conditions, which we argue suggests mTBI-related disruptions in achieving efficient cognitive control and allocation of processing resources.

This is in part because of its excellent spatial resolution, which allows researchers to identify brain areas associated with specific cognitive processes. However, in the quest to localize brain functions, it is relevant to note that many cognitive, sensory, and motor processes have temporal distinctions that are imperative to capture, an aspect that is left unfulfilled by fMRI's suboptimal temporal resolution. To better understand cognitive processes, it is thus advantageous to utilize event-related potential (ERP) recording as a method of gathering information about the brain. Some of its advantages include its fantastic temporal resolution, which gives researchers the ability to follow the activity of the brain down to the millisecond. It also directly indexes both excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials by which most brain computations are performed. This sits in contrast to fMRI, which captures an index of metabolic activity. Further, the non-invasive ERP method does not require a contrast condition: raw ERPs can be examined for just one experimental condition, a distinction from fMRI where control conditions must be subtracted from the experimental condition, leading to uncertainty in associating observations with experimental or contrast conditions. While it is limited by its poor spatial and subcortical activity resolution, ERP recordings' utility, relative cost-effectiveness, and associated advantages offer strong rationale for its use in cognitive neuroscience to track rapid temporal changes in neural activity. In an effort to foster increase in its use as a research imaging method, and to ensure proper and accurate data collection, the present article will outline - in the framework of a paradigm using semantic categorization to examine the effects of antipsychotics and schizotypy on the N400 - the procedure and key aspects associated with ERP data acquisition.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying its ability to modulate brain excitability to improve clinical symptoms remains poorly understood(33). To help improve this understanding, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) can be used as it allows the in vivo quantification of brain metabolites such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in a region-specific manner(41). In fact, a recent study demonstrated that H-1-MRS is indeed a powerful means to better understand the effects of tDCS on neurotransmitter concentration(34). This article aims to describe the complete protocol for combining tDCS (NeuroConn MR compatible stimulator) with H-1-MRS at 3 T using a MEGA-PRESS sequence. We will describe the impact of a protocol that has shown great promise for the treatment of motor dysfunctions after stroke, which consists of bilateral stimulation of primary motor cortices(27,30,31). Methodological factors to consider and possible modifications to the protocol are also discussed.

A meta-analysis of relevant epidemiological studies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Gender; Neuroprotection; Gonadal; Mediation; Menopausal; Activational	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS; ANEURYSMAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; PRIMARY ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME; PRIMARY INTRACRANIAL TUMORS; SHORT-TERM PROGNOSIS; CASE-FATALITY RATES; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOYAMOYA-DISEASE	Background: A vast scientific literature has dealt with gender-specific risk for brain disorder. That field is evolving toward a consensus to the effect that the estrogen hormone family is outstandingly and uniquely neuroprotective. However, the epidemiology relevant to this general outlook remains piecemeal. Method: The present investigation strategically formats the relevant epidemiological findings around the world in order to quantitatively meta-analyze gender ratio of risk for a variety of relevant severe central nervous system (CNS) diseases at all three gonadal stages of the life cycle, pre pubertal, post adolescent/pre menopausal, and post menopausal. Results: The data quantitatively establish that (1) no single epidemiological study should be cited as evidence of gender-specific neuroprotection against the most common severe CNS diseases because the gender-specific risk ratios are contradictory from one study to the other; (2) risk for severe CNS disease is indeed significantly gender-specific, but either gender can be protected: it depends on the disease, not at all on the age bracket. Conclusion: Our assay of gender-specific risk for severe brain disease around the world has not been able to support the idea according to which any one gender-prevalent gonadal steroid hormone dominates as a neuroprotective agent at natural concentrations.

Age, sex, and geographic location have been associated with seroprevalence differences. We describe anti-JCV antibody prevalence in the Canadian cohort of patients enrolled in the JCV Epidemiology in MS study. Methods: This cross-sectional multicenter study evaluated the effects of demographic and disease characteristics on anti-JCV antibody seroprevalence in MS patients irrespective of disease type and treatment. A single blood sample was collected for analysis of anti-JCV antibodies using a two-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Chi-square and logistic regression tests were used to determine significance. Results: A total of 4198 Canadian MS patients participated in the study: the overall anti-JCV antibody prevalence was 56.3% (95% confidence interval: 54.8% to 57.8%). Seroprevalence was significantly associated with age (increasing from 45% in young to 61% in those >60 years), sex, and region (p < 0.0001 for age and sex; p = 0.005 for region). No significant differences in anti-JCV antibody prevalence were associated with race, MS disease type and duration, or number and duration of treatments. Immunosuppressant use was associated with a higher seroprevalence rate (63.4%) compared with no immunosuppressant use (55.9%; p = 0.040). Conclusions: Canadian MS patients had an overall anti-JCV antibody seroprevalence that was consistent with previous studies using the two-step ELISA. Significant associations of anti-JCV antibody positivity were found with age, sex, region, and immunosuppressant therapy, whereas seroprevalence was not associated with race, MS type, MS duration, or number or duration of MS treatments.

C9orf72 Repeat Expansions in Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						C9orf72; repeat expansion; RBD; synucleinopathies	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; GGGGCC-HEXANUCLEOTIDE REPEAT; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; TDP-43; FTD; ALS	Background: A large hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 has been identified as the most common genetic cause in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder that has been strongly linked to synuclein-mediated neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the C9orf72 expansions in the pathogenesis of RBD. Methods: We amplified the C9orf72 repeat expansion in 344 patients with RBD by a repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction assay. Results: We identified two RBD patients carrying the C9orf72 repeat expansion. Most interestingly, these patients have the same C9orf72 associated-risk haplotype identified in 9p21-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia families. Conclusions: Our study enlarges the phenotypic spectrum associated with the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions and suggests that, although rare, this expansion may play a role in the pathogenesis of RBD.

J	Bourguignon, NJ				Bourguignon, Nicolas J.			A rostro-caudal axis for language in the frontal lobe: The role of executive control in speech production	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Executive control; Information theory; Language production; Language processing; Planning and reasoning; Prefrontal cortex; Language evolution	VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; SIDE-BY-SIDE; BROCAS AREA; COGNITIVE CONTROL; VERBAL-FLUENCY; HUMAN BRAIN; GREAT APES; HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION	The present article promotes a formal executive model of frontal functions underlying speech production, bringing together hierarchical theories of adaptive behavior in the (pre-)frontal cortex (pFC) and psycho- and neurolinguistic approaches to spoken language within an information-theoretic framework. Its biological plausibility is revealed through two Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analyses carried out on a total of 41 hemodynamic studies of overt word and continuous speech production respectively. Their principal findings, considered in light of neuropsychological evidence and earlier models of speech-related frontal functions, support the engagement of a caudal-to-rostral gradient of pFC activity operationalized by the nature and quantity of speech-related information conveyed by task-related external cues (i.e., cue codability) on the one hand, and the total informational content of generated utterances on the other. In particular, overt reading or repetition and picture naming recruit primarily caudal motor-premotor regions involved in the sensorimotor and phonological aspects of speech; word and sentence generation engage mid- ventro- and dorsolateral areas supporting its basic predicative and syntactic functions; finally, rostral- and fronto-polar cortices subsume domain-general strategic processes of discourse generation for creative speech. These different levels interact in a top-down fashion, ranging representationally and temporally from the most general and extended to the most specific and immediate. The end-result is an integrative theory of pFC as the main executive component of the language cortical network, which supports the existence of areas specialized for speech communication and articulation and regions subsuming internal reasoning and planning. Prospective avenues of research pertaining to this model's principal predictions are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three observations suggest that alterations in experience-dependent plasticity are an etiological factor in autism: (1) the main cognitive domains enhanced in autism are controlled by the most plastic cortical brain regions, the multimodal association cortices; (2) autism and sensory deprivation share several features of cortical and functional reorganization; and (3) genetic mutations and/or environmental insults involved in autism all appear to affect developmental synaptic plasticity, and mostly lead to its upregulation. We present the Trigger-Threshold-Target (TTT) model of autism to organize these findings. In this model, genetic mutations trigger brain reorganization in individuals with a low plasticity threshold, mostly within regions sensitive to cortical reallocations. These changes account for the cognitive enhancements and reduced social expertise associated with autism. Enhanced but normal plasticity may underlie non-syndromic autism, whereas syndromic autism may occur when a triggering mutation or event produces an altered plastic reaction, also resulting in intellectual disability and dysmorphism in addition to autism. Differences in the target of brain reorganization (perceptual vs. language regions) account for the main autistic subgroups. In light of this model, future research should investigate how individual and sex-related differences in synaptic/regional brain plasticity influence the occurrence of autism. (C) 2014 The Authors.

A Dominant Mutation in Hexokinase 1 (HK1) Causes Retinitis Pigmentosa	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						retinitis pigmentosa; hexokinase; inherited retinal dystrophy	HUMAN BRAIN HEXOKINASE; MULTILOCUS LINKAGE ANALYSIS; DISEASE-CAUSING MUTATIONS; APOPTOTIC CELL-DEATH; GENETIC-VARIATION; SENSORY NEUROPATHY; FUNCTIONAL IMPACT; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; HEREDITARY MOTOR; HEMOLYTIC-ANEMIA	PURPOSE. To identify the cause of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in UTAD003, a large, six-generation Louisiana family with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). METHODS. A series of strategies, including candidate gene screening, linkage exclusion, genomewide linkage mapping, and whole-exome next-generation sequencing, was used to identify a mutation in a novel disease gene on chromosome 10q22.1. Probands from an additional 404 retinal degeneration families were subsequently screened for mutations in this gene. RESULTS. Exome sequencing in UTAD003 led to identification of a single, novel coding variant (c. 2539G>A, p. Glu847Lys) in hexokinase 1 (HK1) present in all affected individuals and absent from normal controls. One affected family member carries two copies of the mutation and has an unusually severe form of disease, consistent with homozygosity for this mutation. Screening of additional adRP probands identified four other families (American, Canadian, and Sicilian) with the same mutation and a similar range of phenotypes. The families share a rare 450-kilobase haplotype containing the mutation, suggesting a founder mutation among otherwise unrelated families. CONCLUSIONS. We identified an HK1 mutation in five adRP families. Hexokinase 1 catalyzes phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. HK1 is expressed in retina, with two abundant isoforms expressed at similar levels. The Glu847Lys mutation is located at a highly conserved position in the protein, outside the catalytic domains. We hypothesize that the effect of this mutation is limited to the retina, as no systemic abnormalities in glycolysis were detected. Prevalence of the HK1 mutation in our cohort of RP families is 1%.

The lack of D3 in mice results in tissue overexposure to TH and a broad neuroendocrine phenotype. Dio3 is an imprinted gene, preferentially expressed from the paternally inherited allele in the mouse fetus. However, heterozygous mice with paternal inheritance of the inactivating Dio3 mutation exhibit an attenuated phenotype when compared with that of Dio3 null mice. To investigate this milder phenotype, the allelic expression of Dio3 was evaluated in different mouse tissues. Preferential allelic expression of Dio3 from the paternal allele was observed in fetal tissues and neonatal brain regions, whereas the biallelic Dio3 expression occurred in the developing eye, testes, and cerebellum and in the postnatal brain neocortex, which expresses a larger Dio3 mRNA transcript. The newborn hypothalamus manifests the highest degree of Dio3 expression from the paternal allele, compared with other brain regions, and preferential allelic expression of Dio3 in the brain relaxed in late neonatal life. A methylation analysis of two regulatory regions of the Dio3 imprinted domain revealed modest but significant differences between tissues, but these did not consistently correlate with the observed patterns of Dio3 allelic expression. Deletion of the Dio3 gene and promoter did not result in significant changes in the tissue-specific patterns of Dio3 allelic expression. These results suggest the existence of unidentified epigenetic determinants of tissue-specific Dio3 imprinting. The resulting variation in the Dio3 allelic expression between tissues likely explains the phenotypic variation that results from paternal Dio3 haploinsufficiency.	[Martinez, M.

In advancing age, these latent alterations correlate with detectable motor and cognitive function decline. Until now, the interacting effects of concussions and the normal ageing process on white matter tract integrity remain unknown. Here we used a tract-based spatial statistical method to uncover potential white matter tissue damage in 15 retired athletes with a history of concussions, free of comorbid medical conditions. We also investigated potential associations between white matter integrity and declines in cognitive and motor functions. Compared to an age-and education-matched control group of 15 retired athletes without concussions, former athletes with concussions exhibited widespread white matter anomalies along many major association, interhemispheric, and projection tracts. Group contrasts revealed decreases in fractional anisotropy, as well as increases in mean and radial diffusivity measures in the concussed group. These differences were primarily apparent in fronto-parietal networks as well as in the frontal aspect of the corpus callosum. The white matter anomalies uncovered in concussed athletes were significantly associated with a decline in episodic memory and lateral ventricle expansion. Finally, the expected association between frontal white matter integrity and motor learning found in former non-concussed athletes was absent in concussed participants. Together, these results show that advancing age in retired athletes presenting with a history of sports-related concussions is linked to diffuse white matter abnormalities that are consistent with the effects of traumatic axonal injury and exacerbated demyelination. These changes in white matter integrity might explain the cognitive and motor function declines documented in this population.

The hallmark of the pathology is its significant loss of nigrostriatal dopamine, which is necessary for the cortico-striatal interactions that underlie executive control. Striatal dopamine reuptake is mediated by the SLC6A3 gene (formerly named DAT1) and its polymorphisms, which have been largely overlooked in Parkinson's disease. Thirty patients (ages 53-68 years; 19 males, 11 females) at early stages of Parkinson's disease, were genotyped according to a 9-repeat (9R) or 10-repeat (10R) allele on the SLC6A3/DAT1 gene. They underwent neuropsychological assessment and functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a set-shifting task (a computerized Wisconsin Card Sorting Task) that relies on fronto-striatal interactions. Patients homozygous on the 10R allele performed significantly better on working memory tasks than 9R-carrier patients. Most importantly, patients carrying a 9R allele exhibited less activation than their 10R homozygous counterparts in the prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex and caudate nucleus, when planning and executing a set-shift. This pattern was exacerbated for conditions that usually recruit the striatum compared to those that do not. This is the first study indicating that the SLC6A3/DAT1 genotype has a significant effect on fronto-striatal activation and performance in Parkinson's disease. This effect is stronger for conditions that engage the striatum. Longitudinal studies are warranted to assess this polymorphism's effect on the clinical evolution of patients with Parkinson's disease, especially with cognitive decline.

J	Bouchard, JP				Bouchard, Jean-Pierre			The curative and preventative interest of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in the treatment of delusional schizophrenic criminogenic beliefs: CBT of a delusional conviction that generated a double homicide outside the patient's family	ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES			French	Article						Behavioral therapy; Cognitive therapy; Dangerousness; Delusional conviction; Delusions of persecution; Evaluation; Homicide; Prevention; Psychotherapy; Schizophrenia	DOUBLE PARRICIDE; INTERVENTION; PSYCHOSIS	Subject and problematic. - Delusions of persecution and prejudice are the most common delusional themes. Psychotic subjects (schizophrenics or paranoiacs) who suffer from delirium are therefore liable to defensive behavioural characteristics and mechanisms, often leading to the pathological reactions of defence and/or vengeance. These reactions come from behaviour that compels one towards avoidance or escape, sometimes even aggression towards the perceived persecutors. In such cases, violent acts are committed in an effort to control or destroy the source of perceived suffering and persecution. Several examples regularly attest this claim. Some of these pathological reactions can even give rise to unique or multiple homicides. Cognitive and behavioural therapies are a therapeutic method that can be used to treat some of these delusional beliefs. Patient and method. - In this article, we present a cognitive and behavioural therapy for this type of criminogenic delusional belief. We carried out this therapy with the dangerous schizophrenic perpetrator of a double homicide that was driven by a pathological need for vengeance. This patient was convinced for four years that his girlfriend's mother had deliberately transmitted the AIDS virus to him by making him drink a coffee, and that as a result he was going to die in terrible agony. "She contaminated me because I wanted to leave her daughter and she was not happy about this", he thought. Following the manifestation of this mistaken conviction, the patient developed a reactive depression: a social retreat and a significant isolation, during which he constantly nourished his delusional thoughts. As a way of anticipating this "death by AIDS", he eventually wished first to eliminate the person whom he held responsible for his contamination, then to commit suicide. In the latter stages, his thoughts came to him "as voices" which he heard repeatedly in his head: "I have AIDS! I'm going to die! I must kill her! I absolutely must kill her! There's nothing to do, I must kill her!". As a result, using a hunting rifle he killed a couple, having mistook his target. The aim of the therapy was to induce a doubt in the delusional conviction of his contamination. This increasingly significant doubt and the gradual alleviation of the delirium were mainly researched using the socratic method of modifying belief(s). This technique enabled progressive critical analysis of the "proofs" which had lead the subject to construct and furnish his erroneous conviction while wrongly processing extra psychic or infra information. While still respecting the pathological belief of the patient, this method allowed him to find alternative and substitutional explanations for his false ideas. The reinforcement of the delusional belief by direct confrontation was thus avoided, and the patient grew to realise and understand the dysfunctional dimension of his cognition, his emotions and his behaviour. The therapeutic care carried out in a unit devoted to dangerous patients was composed of five sessions of functional analysis, followed by twelve sessions of therapy at a rate of one session a week. Between each session, the patient was required to complete some exercises. Result. - Disappearance of the delusional criminogenic conviction by the end of therapy. The depressed state of mind, like his suicidal tendencies, decreased step-by-step as the conviction of having AIDS extinguished, the disappearance of the cause naturally leading to the dissipation of its effects. Discussion/conclusion. - After the failure of traditional psychiatric therapies to resolve or to ease the patient's delirium and the reactional symptomatology to this delusion, we note the success of the cognitivist approach and regret that it did not take place before the transition of this delusion into criminal acts. Obtaining this result was certainly facilitated by the relative recentness of the delusional conviction, by the total investment of the patient in psychotherapy in order to "escape death", by his consequently increased suggestibility, and by the existence of a predominantly healthy psyche. Equally one intist notice in the subject the existing disproportion between the extreme division (one single overbearing mistaken belief), or even the banality of the delusion, and his criminogenic power (two homicides preceded and followed by vague suicidal tendencies as well as significant, recurring, vindictive tendencies). Similarly, the relative ease in resolving the problem seems disproportionate compared to the emotional and psychodynamic power. Non-confrontational and progressive dissolution of the components of the delusion, with very active participation from this chemo resistant patient, formed the central and effective axis of this therapy, carried out in 1994. It seems that this psychotherapy may be the first CBT for a criminogenic delusional conviction carried out on a schizophrenic murderer. Since then, scientific literature has consistently confirmed the interest of cognitive and behavioural therapies in the treatment of some schizophrenic delusional beliefs. Whether associated with traditional strategies (hospitalisations, psychotropic chemotherapy, etc.) or with newer and complementary techniques (modules in rehabilitation of social skills, neuroleptic modules, psychoeducation, etc.), these therapies seem especially effective when they are carried out early in the genesis of delusional beliefs.

While numerous studies report modulation of cognitive abilities following DLPFC stimulation, the wide array of cognitive functions that can be modulated makes it difficult to predict its precise outcome. Objective: The present review aims at identifying and characterizing the various cognitive domains affected by tDCS over DLPFC. Methods: Articles using tDCS over DLPFC indexed in PubMed and published between January 2000 and January 2014 were included in the present review. Results: tDCS over DLPFC affects a wide array of cognitive functions, with sometimes apparent conflicting results. Conclusion: Prefrontal tDCS has the potential to modulate numerous cognitive functions simultaneously, but to properly interpret the results, a clear a priori hypothesis is necessary, careful technical consideration are mandatory, further insights into the neurobiological impact of tDCS are needed, and consideration should be given to the possibility that some behavioral effects may be partly explained by parallel modulation of related functions.

Patients and methods: A total of 50,856 men, who were 65 years of age or older with clinically localind prostate cancer diagnosed between 1992 and 2005 and without a diagnosis of mental illness at baseline, were abstracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare database. The primary outcome of interest was the development of Mill (anxiety, major depressive disorder, depressive disorder not elsewhere classified, neurotic depression, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and suicide) after the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Results: A total of 10,389 men (20.4%) developed MHI during the study period. Independent risk factors for MET included age >= 75 years (hazard ratio [HR] =. 1.29); higher comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity index >= 3, HR = 1.63); rural hospital location (HR = 1.14); being single, divorced, or widowed (HR = 1.12); later year of diagnosis (HR = 1.05); and urinary incontinence (HR = 1.47). Black race (HR = 0.79), very high-income status (HR = 0.87), and definitive treatment (radical prostatectomy [RP], HR = 0.79; radiotherapy [RT], HR = 0.85, all P < 0.001) predicted a lower risk of MHI. The rates of MHI at 10 years were 29.7%, 29.0%, and 22.6% in men undergoing watchful waiting (WW), RT, and RP, respectively. Conclusion: Older men with localized prostate cancer had a significant burden of MM. Men treated with RP or RT were at a lower risk of developing MET, compared with those undergoing WW, with median time to development of MHI being significantly greater in those undergoing RP compared with those undergoing RT or WW.

This is the first study to examine whether the various inter-correlated dimensions of impulsiveness are related to problems with prospective memory. Undergraduate students (N=184) completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11, the Prospective Memory Questionnaire, the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire, and two objective prospective memory tests. Results revealed consistent correlations between the various dimensions of impulsiveness (attentional, motor, non-planning) and self-reported problems with prospective memory. Subsequent regression analyses indicated that attentional impulsiveness is a unique predictor of self-reported problems with internally cued prospective memory, and non-planning impulsiveness is a unique predictor of self-reported problems with episodic and overall prospective memory. Similarly, findings from the objective prospective tests showed that non-planning impulsiveness was related to worse performance on the two prospective memory tests. Whereas non-planning impulsiveness was also related to using fewer prospective memory-aiding strategies, mediation analyses showed that use of these strategies does not account for any of the detected relationships. Because the findings suggest that a failure to plan does not underlie the detected effects, other potential explanations for the relationships are discussed.

Pharmacological management of chronic neuropathic pain: Revised consensus statement from the Canadian Pain Society	PAIN RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Analgesic agents; Neuropathic pain; Randomized controlled trials	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; CONTROLLED CROSSOVER TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND CROSSOVER; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; RANDOMIZED-WITHDRAWAL; GENERAL-POPULATION; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; NONMALIGNANT PAIN	Background: Neuropathic pain (NeP), redefined as pain caused by a lesion or a disease of the somatosensory system, is a disabling condition that affects approximately two million Canadians. Objective: To review the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews related to the pharmacological management of NeP to develop a revised evidence-based consensus statement on its management. Methods: RCTs, systematic reviews and existing guidelines on the pharmacological management of NeP were evaluated at a consensus meeting in May 2012 and updated until September 2013. Medications were recommended in the consensus statement if their analgesic efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically sound RCT (class I or class II) showing significant benefit relative to placebo or another relevant control group. Recommendations for treatment were based on the degree of evidence of analgesic efficacy, safety and ease of use. Results: Analgesic agents recommended for first-line treatments are gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Tramadol and controlled release opioid analgesics are recommended as second-line treatments for moderate to severe pain. Cannabinoids are now recommended as third-line treatments. Recommended fourth-line treatments include methadone, anticonvulsants with lesser evidence of efficacy (eg, lamotrigine, lacosamide), tapentadol and botulinum toxin. There is support for some analgesic combinations in selected NeP conditions. Conclusions: These guidelines provide an updated, stepwise approach to the pharmacological management of NeP. Treatment should be individualized for each patient based on efficacy, side-effect profile and drug accessibility, including cost. Additional studies are required to examine head-to-head comparisons among analgesics, combinations of analgesics, long-term outcomes and treatment of pediatric, geriatric and central NeP.	[Moulin, D.

Relational Reasoning in Medical Education: Patterns in Discourse and Diagnosis	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						relational reasoning; medical education; discourse analysis; apprenticeship model	ANALOGICAL TRANSFER; KNOWLEDGE; COMPREHENSION; SIMILARITY; EXPERTISE; STUDENTS	Relational reasoning, which has been defined as the ability to discern meaningful patterns within any informational stream, is a foundational cognitive ability associated with education, including in scientific domains. This study entailed the analysis of instructional conversations in which an attending clinical neurologist and his team of residents made diagnostic and therapeutic decisions about actual patients in a hospital setting. The primary goal was to investigate the role of 4 manifestations of relational reasoning (i.e., analogy, anomaly, antinomy, and antithesis) in medical education and diagnostic and therapeutic decision making. Results indicated that the degree to which members of the medical team used the 4 forms of relational reasoning depended on their role and expertise, as well as the time point in the problem-solving process. Specific reasoning patterns that emerged in the discourse and a prototypical model of the reasoning process are described and implications for research and practice are considered.

Research suggests that adverse events early in life can lead to changes in gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms that alter stress reactivity, brain function, and behaviour. Although epigenetic changes are often long lasting, they can be reversed with pharmacological and environmental manipulations. The complexity of the epigenome is not fully understood. The aim of this Review is to assess emerging data for the role of epigenetic mechanisms in stress-related psychiatric disorders with a focus on future research. We describe the epigenetic processes, key findings in this specialty, clinical implications of research, and methodological issues. Studies are needed to investigate new epigenetic processes other than methylation and assess the efficacy of interventions to reverse epigenetic processes associated with the effects of early life adversity.

Many studies have focused on mechanisms that contribute to integrating sounds that belong together into one perceptual stream (integration) and segregating those that come from different sound sources (segregation). However, little is known about mechanisms that allow us to perceive individual sound sources within a dynamically changing auditory scene, when the input may be ambiguous, and heard as either integrated or segregated. This study tested the question of whether focusing on one of two possible sound organizations suppressed representation of the alternative organization. We presented listeners with ambiguous input and cued them to switch between tasks that used either the integrated or the segregated percept. Electrophysiological measures indicated which organization was currently maintained in memory. If mutual exclusivity at the neural level was the rule, attention to one of two possible organizations would preclude neural representation of the other. However, significant MMNs were elicited to both the target organization and the unattended, alternative organization, along with the target-related P3b component elicited only to the designated target organization. Results thus indicate that both organizations (integrated and segregated) were simultaneously maintained in memory regardless of which task was performed. Focusing attention to one aspect of the sounds did not abolish the alternative, unattended organization when the stimulus input was ambiguous. In noisy environments, such as walking on a city street, rapid and flexible adaptive processes are needed to help facilitate rapid switching to different sound sources in the environment. Having multiple representations available to the attentive system would allow for such flexibility, needed in everyday situations to maintain stable auditory percepts, and to allow rapid scanning of interesting events in a busy environment.

Whether this region contributes to cognitive control through material-general mechanisms, or through hemispheric specialization of component abilities, remains unclear. Here we show that left or right ventrolateral PFC damage in humans leads to doubly dissociable deficits in two classic tests of interference control. Patients with damage centered on left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex had exaggerated interference effects in the color-word Stroop, but not the Eriksen flanker task, whereas patients with damage affecting right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex showed the opposite pattern. Thus, effective interference resolution requires either right or left lateral PFC, depending on the nature of the task. This finding supports a lateralized, material-specific account of cognitive control in humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most studies of PABPC1 have focused on its N-terminal RRM domains, which bind the mRNA 3' poly(A) tail and 5' translation complex eIF4F via eIF4G; however, the protein also contains a C-terminal MLLE domain that binds a peptide motif, termed PAM2, found in many proteins involved in translation regulation and mRNA metabolism. Studies over the past decade have revealed additional functions of PAM2-containing proteins (PACs) in neurodegenerative diseases, circadian rhythms, innate defense, and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Here, we summarize functional and structural studies of the MLLE/PAM2 interaction and discuss the diverse roles of PACs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High frequency oscillations in intra- operative electrocorticography before and after epilepsy surgery	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; Focal epilepsy; Electrocorticography; High frequency oscillations	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; INTRAOPERATIVE ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; SEIZURE REMISSION; RESECTION; CHILDREN; BRAIN; HZ; RECORDINGS	Objective: Removal of brain tissue showing high frequency oscillations (HFOs; ripples: 80-250 Hz and fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) in preresection electrocorticography (preECoG) in epilepsy patients seems a predictor of good surgical outcome. We analyzed occurrence and localization of HFOs in intra-operative preECoG and postresection electrocorticography (postECoG). Methods: HFOs were automatically detected in one-minute epochs of intra-operative ECoG sampled at 2048 Hz of fourteen patients. Ripple, fast ripple, spike, ripples on a spike (RoS) and not on a spike (RnoS) rates were analyzed in pre- and postECoG for resected and nonresected electrodes. Results: Ripple, spike and fast ripple rates decreased after resection. RnoS decreased less than RoS (74% vs. 83%; p = 0.01). Most fast ripples in preECoG were located in resected tissue. PostECoG fast ripples occurred in one patient with poor outcome. Patients with good outcome had relatively high postECoG RnoS rates, specifically in the sensorimotor cortex. Conclusions: Our observations show that fast ripples in intra-operative ECoG, compared to ripples, may be a better biomarker for epileptogenicity. Further studies have to determine the relation between resection of epileptogenic tissue and physiological ripples generated by the sensorimotor cortex. Significance: Fast ripples in intra-operative ECoG can help identify the epileptogenic zone, while ripples might also be physiological. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Maternal prenatal anxiety and child brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genotype: Effects on internalizing symptoms from 4 to 15 years of age	DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							CRISP EXPERIENTIAL INDEX; STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS; ANTENATAL ANXIETY; BEHAVIOURAL/EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS; PREADOLESCENT CHILDREN; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; DOWN-REGULATION; PREGNANCY; CORTISOL; EXPRESSION	Multiple behavioral and health outcomes, including internalizing symptoms, may be predicted from prenatal maternal anxiety, depression, or stress. However, not all children are affected, and those that are can be affected in different ways. Here we test the hypothesis that the effects of prenatal anxiety are moderated by genetic variation in the child's brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children population cohort. Internalizing symptoms were assessed from 4 to 13 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (n = 8,584); a clinical interview with the adolescents was conducted at age 15 years (n = 4,704). Obstetric and psychosocial risk and postnatal maternal symptoms were included as covariates. Results show that prenatal maternal anxiety predicted internalizing symptoms, including with the diagnostic assessment at 15 years. There was a main effect of two BDNF polymorphisms (rs6265 [val66met] and rs11030104) on internalizing symptoms up to age 13. There was also genetic moderation of the prenatal anxiety effect by different BDNF polymorphisms (rs11030121 and rs7124442), although significant effects were limited to preadolescence. The findings suggest a role for BDNF gene-environment interactions in individual vulnerability to the effects of prenatal anxiety on child internalizing symptoms.

Several experimental approaches that reduce inflammation also result in attenuation of depressive symptoms. We have demonstrated that Resolvin D1 (RvD1), a metabolite of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) derived from docosahexaenoic acid, diminishes infarct size and neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic myocardium. The aim of this study is to determine if a single RvD1 injection could alleviate depressive symptoms in a rat model of MI. MI was induced in rats by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 40 min. Five minutes before ischemia or after reperfusion, 0.1 mu g of RvD1 or vehicle was injected in the left ventricle cavity. Fourteen days after MI, behavioral tests (forced swim test and socialization) were conducted to evaluate depression-like symptoms. RvD1 reduced infarct size in the treated vs. the vehicle group. Animals receiving RvD1 also showed better performance in the forced swim and social interaction tests vs. vehicle controls. These results indicate that a single RvD1 dose, given 5 min before occlusion or 5 min after the onset of reperfusion, decreases infarct size and attenuates depression-like symptoms.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Epidemic Spreading Model to Characterize Misfolded Proteins Propagation in Aging and Associated Neurodegenerative Disorders	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; AMYLOID CASCADE HYPOTHESIS; TO-NEURON TRANSMISSION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; HYPOTHETICAL MODEL; DYNAMIC BIOMARKERS	Misfolded proteins (MP) are a key component in aging and associated neurodegenerative disorders. For example, misfolded Amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau proteins are two neuropathogenic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanisms underlying intrabrain MP propagation/deposition remain essentially uncharacterized. Here, is introduced an epidemic spreading model (ESM) for MP dynamics that considers propagation-like interactions between MP agents and the brain's clearance response across the structural connectome. The ESM reproduces advanced A beta deposition patterns in the human brain (explaining 46 similar to 56% of the variance in regional A beta loads, in 733 subjects from the ADNI database). Furthermore, this model strongly supports a) the leading role of A beta clearance deficiency and early A beta onset age during Alzheimer's disease progression, b) that effective anatomical distance from A beta outbreak region explains regional A beta arrival time and A beta deposition likelihood, c) the multi-factorial impact of APOE e4 genotype, gender and educational level on lifetime intra-brain A beta propagation, and d) the modulatory impact of A beta propagation history on tau proteins concentrations, supporting the hypothesis of an interrelated pathway between A beta pathophysiology and tauopathy. To our knowledge, the ESM is the first computational model highlighting the direct link between structural brain networks, production/clearance of pathogenic proteins and associated intercellular transfer mechanisms, individual genetic/demographic properties and clinical states in health and disease. In sum, the proposed ESM constitutes a promising framework to clarify intra-brain region to region transference mechanisms associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders.

In this minireview, we argue that one role of contextual modulation is to enhance the perception of contours at the expense of textures, in short to de-texturize the image. The evidence for this role comes mainly from three sources: psychophysical studies of shape after-effects, computational models of neurons that exhibit iso-orientation surround inhibition, and fMRI studies revealing specialized areas for contour as opposed to texture processing. The relationship between psychophysical studies that support the notion of contextual modulation as de-texturizer and those that investigate contour integration and crowding is discussed.

Its role in generating feature selectivity within the retina and primary visual cortex has been extensively described in the literature. Here, we describe how similar computations can also elaborate feature selectivity in the extrastriate areas of both the dorsal and ventral streams of the primate visual system. We discuss recent work that makes use of normalization models to test specific roles for contextual modulation in visual cortex function. We suggest that contextual modulation renders neuronal populations more selective for naturalistic stimuli. Specifically, we discuss contextual modulation's role in processing optic flow in areas MT and MST and for representing naturally occurring curvature and contours in areas V4 and IT. We also describe how the circuitry that supports contextual modulation is robust to variations in overall input levels. Finally, we describe how this theory relates to other hypothesized roles for contextual modulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Prevalence and incidence studies often use unvalidated screening tools resulting in estimates of uncertain accuracy. We present the Canadian Longitudinal Study on AgingEpilepsy Algorithm (CLSA-EA) as well as the results of our validation study designed to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of this epilepsy ascertainment algorithm. MethodsWe administered English or French-language versions of the CLSA-EA questionnaire to a consecutive sample of participants from a population-based cohort of 50,000 individuals aged between 45 and 85years at baseline, as well as a consecutive sample of individuals from an epilepsy-enriched general neurology clinic. Every participant was also assessed by a study neurologist who, blinded to the results of the CLSA-EA, determined whether the person had epilepsy or not. ResultsWe recruited 242 consecutive participants, 34 of whom were diagnosed with epilepsy by a study neurologist. The sensitivity and specificity of the CLSA-EA for a lifetime history of epilepsy were 97.1% and 98.1%, and for active epilepsy were 100% and 98.6%, when we defined a positive screening test result as a positive response to the antiepileptic drug question and either the single self-report diagnosis or any of the symptom-based questions. SignificanceThe CLSA-EA was found to have a high sensitivity and specificity for the identification of adults with a lifetime history of epilepsy and active epilepsy. Although validation in other settings and age groups is required, the future application of this algorithm to population-based studies such as the CLSA should help to ensure more accurate estimates of the prevalence and incidence of epilepsy in the general population when a physician assessment is impossible.

The Clinical Reasoning That Guides Therapists in Interpreting Errors in Real-World Performance	JOURNAL OF HEAD TRAUMA REHABILITATION			English	Article						brain injuries; cognition; diagnostic reasoning; health professional assessment; rehabilitation	MULTIPLE ERRANDS TEST; ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY; SIMPLIFIED VERSION	Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the reasoning used by clinicians when deciding whether errors observed during the performance of everyday activities were made by clients with acquired brain injury (ABI) or by healthy controls. Methods: Ninety clinicians observed 27 short video clips of subjects (ABI, healthy controls), carrying out the Baycrest Multiple Errands Test. On the basis of their observations, they classified subjects into either an ABI or healthy control group and specified their reasons. Their reasoning was analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The majority of the coded material explaining the reasoning behind correct attributions of performance errors to people with ABI related to 3 general themes: (1) inefficient executive functioning, (2) task-related difficulty, and (3) prediction of impact on independence in everyday activities. Clinicians were most successful at identifying neurological subjects when subjects either omitted tasks or took an excessive amount of time to complete the test. Conclusions: Correctly interpreting performance errors in real-world tests relies on clinicians' observational and clinical reasoning skills combined with their theoretical knowledge of constructs underlying the evaluation. Some clinical signs bear more weight than others when clinicians interpret performance errors to determine whether the behavior is pathological.

These approaches often rely on a large number of manually segmented atlases (e.g. 30-80) that take significant time and expertise to produce. We present an algorithm, MAGeT-Brain (Multiple Automatically Generated Templates), for the automatic segmentation of the hippocampus that minimises the number of atlases needed whilst still achieving similar agreement to multi-atlas approaches. Thus, our method acts as a reliable multi-atlas approach when using special or hard-to-define atlases that are laborious to construct. Method: MAGeT-Brain works by propagating atlas segmentations to a template library, formed from a subset of target images, via transformations estimated by nonlinear image registration. The resulting segmentations are then propagated to each target image and fused using a label fusion method. We conduct two separate Monte Carlo cross-validation experiments comparing MAGeT-Brain and basic multi-atlas whole hippocampal segmentation using differing atlas and template library sizes, and registration and label fusion methods. The first experiment is a 10-fold validation (per parameter setting) over 60 subjects taken from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database (ADNI), and the second is a five-fold validation over 81 subjects having had a first episode of psychosis. In both cases, automated segmentations are compared with manual segmentations following the Pruessner-protocol. Using the best settings found from these experiments, we segment 246 images of the ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T dataset and compare these with segmentations from existing automated and semi-automated methods: FSL FIRST, FreeSurfer, MAPER, and SNT. Finally, we conduct a leave-one-out cross-validation of hippocampal subfield segmentation in standard 3T T1-weighted images, using five high-resolution manually segmented atlases (Winterburn et al., 2013). Results: In the ADNI cross-validation, using 9 atlases MAGeT-Brain achieves a mean Dice's Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score of 0.869 with respect to manual whole hippocampus segmentations, and also exhibits significantly lower variability in DSC scores than multi-atlas segmentation. In the younger, psychosis dataset, MAGeT-Brain achieves a mean DSC score of 0.892 and produces volumes which agree with manual segmentation volumes better than those produced by the FreeSurfer and FSL FIRST methods (mean difference in volume: 80 mm(3), 1600 mm(3), and 800 mm(3), respectively). Similarly, in the ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T dataset, MAGeT-Brain produces hippocampal segmentations well correlated (r > 0.85) with SNT semi-automated reference volumes within disease categories, and shows a conservative bias and a mean difference in volume of 250 mm(3) across the entire dataset, compared with FreeSurfer and FSL FIRST which both overestimate volume differences by 2600 mm(3) and 2800 mm(3) on average, respectively. Finally, MAGeT-Brain segments the CA1, CA4/DG and subiculum subfields on standard 3T T1-weighted resolution images with DSC overlap scores of 0.56, 0.65, and 0.58, respectively, relative to manual segmentations. Conclusion: We demonstrate that MAGeT-Brain produces consistent whole hippocampal segmentations using only 9 atlases, or fewer, with various hippocampal definitions, disease populations, and image acquisition types. Additionally, we show that MAGeT-Brain identifies hippocampal subfields in standard 3T T1-weighted images with overlap scores comparable to competing methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Integrity of these systems can be examined by correlation methods based on analysis of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here we investigate functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) in normal ageing and AD using resting state fMRI. Images from young and elderly controls, and patients with AD were processed using spatial independent component analysis to identify the DMN. Functional connectivity was quantified using integration and indices derived from graph theory. Four DMN sub-systems were identified: Frontal (medial and superior), parietal (precuneus-posterior cingulate, lateral parietal), temporal (medial temporal), and hippocampal (bilateral). There was a decrease in antero-posterior interactions (lower global efficiency), but increased interactions within the frontal and parietal sub-systems (higher local clustering) in elderly compared to young controls. This decreased antero-posterior integration was more pronounced in AD patients compared to elderly controls, particularly in the precuneus-posterior cingulate region. Conjoint knowledge of integration measures and graph indices in the same data helps in the interpretation of functional connectivity results, as comprehension of one measure improves with understanding of the other. The approach allows for complete characterisation of connectivity changes and could be applied to other resting state networks and different pathologies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A secondary goal was to examine the relationship between emotion processing, mentalizing, and executive functions in PD during interpersonal communication. Method: Fifteen adults with PD and 16 healthy adults completed The Awareness of Social Inference Test, a standardized tool comprised of video-taped vignettes of everyday social interactions (McDonald, Flanagan, Rollins, & Kinch, 2003). Individual subtests assessed participants' ability to recognize basic emotions and to infer speaker intentions (sincerity, lies, sarcasm) from verbal and nonverbal cues, and to judge speaker knowledge, beliefs, and feelings. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation was also conducted. Results: Patients with mild-moderate PD were impaired in the ability to infer "enriched" social intentions, such as sarcasm or lies, from nonliteral remarks; in contrast, adults with and without PD showed a similar capacity to recognize emotions and social intentions meant to be literal. In the PD group, difficulties using theory of mind to draw complex social inferences were significantly correlated with limitations in working memory and executive functioning. Conclusions: In early PD, functional compromise of the frontal-striatal-dorsal system yields impairments in social perception and understanding nonliteral speaker intentions that draw upon cognitive theory of mind. Deficits in social perception in PD are exacerbated by a decline in executive resources, which could hamper the strategic deployment of attention to multiple information sources necessary to infer social intentions.

Specifically, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents targeting amyloid deposition have provided unprecedented opportunities for refining in vivo diagnosis, monitoring disease propagation, and advancing AD clinical trials. Furthermore, the use of a miniaturized version of PET (microPET) in transgenic (Tg) animals has been a successful strategy for accelerating the development of novel radiopharmaceuticals. However, advanced applications of microPET focusing on the longitudinal propagation of AD pathophysiology or therapeutic strategies remain in their infancy. This review highlights what we have learned from microPET imaging in Tg models displaying amyloid and tau pathology, and anticipates cutting-edge applications with high translational value to clinical research.

Here, we used high-density electroencephalography to study cortical connectivity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and age-matched healthy controls while they performed repetitive movements of the right index finger at maximal repetition rate. Multiple source beamformer analysis and dynamic causal modeling were used to assess oscillatory coupling between the lateral premotor cortex (lPM), supplementary motor area (SMA), and primary motor cortex (M1) in the contralateral hemisphere. Elderly healthy controls showed task-related modulation in connections from lPM to SMA and M1, mainly within the gamma-band (> 30 Hz). Nonmedicated PD patients also showed task-related gamma-gamma coupling from lPM to M1, but gamma coupling from lPM to SMA was absent. Levodopa reinstated physiological gamma-gamma coupling from lPM to SMA and significantly strengthened coupling in the feedback connection from M1 to lPM expressed as beta-beta as well as theta-beta coupling. Enhancement in cross-frequency theta-beta coupling from M1 to lPM was correlated with levodopa-induced improvement in motor function. The results show that PD is associated with an altered neural communication between premotor and motor cortical areas, which can be modulated by dopamine replacement.

Characterizing this relationship during healthy neurodevelopment is critical to understanding processes associated with the emergence of child/adolescent onset mood/anxiety disorders. In this study, mixed-effects models were used to determine longitudinal cortical thickness correlates of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Young Adult Self Report Anxious/Depressed scores in healthy children. Analyses included 341 subjects from 4.9 to 22.3 year-old with repeated MRI at up to 3 time points, at 2-year intervals (586 MRI scans). There was a significant "CBCL Anxious/Depressed by Age" interaction on cortical thickness in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), including the medial orbito-frontal, gyrus rectus, and subgenual anterior cingulate areas. Anxious/Depressed scores were negatively associated with thickness at younger ages (< 9 years), but positively associated with thickness at older ages (15-22 years), with the shift in polarity occurring around age 12. This was secondary to a slower rate of vmPFC cortical thinning in subjects with higher scores. In young adults (18-22 years), Anxious/Depressed scores were also positively associated with precuneus/posterior cingulate cortical thickness. Potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying this maturation pattern are proposed. These results demonstrate the dynamic impact of age on relations between vmPFC and negative affect in the developing brain.

Coagulation and angiogenic gene expression profiles are defined by molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma: evidence for growth factor-thrombin cross-talk	JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS			English	Article						angiogenesis modulating agents; blood coagulation factors; medulloblastoma; molecular pathology; oncogenes	BEVACIZUMAB PLUS IRINOTECAN; TISSUE FACTOR EXPRESSION; BRAIN-TUMOR CONSORTIUM; PEDIATRIC MEDULLOBLASTOMAS; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; MALIGNANT GLIOMA; GENOMIC ANALYSIS; FACTOR RECEPTOR; FACTOR VIIA; CANCER	BackgroundThe coagulation system becomes activated during progression and therapy of high-grade brain tumors. Triggering tissue factor (F3/TF) and thrombin receptors (F2R/PAR-1) may influence the vascular tumor microenvironment and angiogenesis irrespective of clinically apparent thrombosis. These processes are poorly understood in medulloblastoma (MB), in which diverse oncogenic pathways define at least four molecular disease subtypes (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4). We asked whether there is a link between molecular subtype and the network of vascular regulators expressed in MB. MethodsUsing R2 microarray analysis and visualization platform, we mined MB datasets for differential expression of vascular (coagulation and angiogenesis)-related genes, and explored their link to known oncogenic drivers. We evaluated the functional significance of this link in DAOY cells in vitro following growth factor and thrombin stimulation. ResultsThe coagulome and angiome differ across MB subtypes. F3/TF and F2R/PAR-1 mRNA expression are upregulated in SHH tumors and correlate with higher levels of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET). Cultured DAOY (MB) cells exhibit an up-regulation of F3/TF and F2R/PAR-1 following combined SHH and MET ligand (HGF) treatment. These factors cooperate with thrombin, impacting the profile of vascular regulators, including interleukin 1 (IL1B) and chondromodulin 1 (LECT1). ConclusionsCoagulation pathway sensors (F3/TF, F2R/PAR-1) are expressed in MB in a subtype-specific manner, and may be functionally linked to SHH and MET circuitry. Thus coagulation system perturbations may elicit subtype/context-specific changes in vascular and cellular responses in MB.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between physical functioning and cardiovascular burden on the cognitive performance of community-dwelling older adults. Method. Ninety-three adults aged 60 and older completed a medical evaluation by a geriatrician, performance-based physical tests, and neuropsychological assessments. Cognitive composite scores (memory, speed, and executive) as well as a physical functioning score were created by averaging standardized z-scores of selected tests. A cardiovascular burden index was also computed by totalling the number of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases. Results. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses reveal that higher level of physical functioning was significantly associated with greater processing speed and better executive functions but was not associated with memory performance. These relations were independent of age, sex, and level of education. Cardiovascular burden was not significantly associated with any cognitive domain. Discussion. These results suggest that cognition is related to simple performance-based physical tests and highlight the importance of intervention studies aimed at enhancing cognitive and physical functioning in older adults.

Although mutations are also found in canonical signaling pathway genes, we and others identified chromatin-associated proteins to be more commonly altered by somatic alterations than any other class of oncoprotein in several subgroups of childhood high-grade brain tumors. Furthermore, as these childhood malignancies carry fewer non-synonymous somatic mutations per case in contrast to most adult cancers, these mutations are likely drivers in these tumors. Herein, we will use as examples of this novel hallmark of oncogenesis high-grade astrocytomas, including glioblastoma, and a subgroup of embryonal tumors, embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) to describe the novel molecular defects uncovered in these deadly tumors. We will further discuss evidence for their profound effects on the epigenome. The relative genetic simplicity of these tumors promises general insights into how mutations in the chromatin machinery modify downstream epigenetic signatures to drive transformation, and how to target this plastic genetic/epigenetic interface.

One of these mutations leads to analogous p.Lys27Met (K27M) mutations in both H3.3 and H3.1 variants, is associated with rapid fatal outcome, and occurs specifically in HGA of the midline in children and young adults. This includes diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (80 %) and thalamic or spinal HGA (> 90 %), which are surgically challenging locations with often limited tumor material available and critical need for specific histopathological markers. Here, we analyzed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 143 pediatric HGA and 297 other primary brain tumors or normal brain. Immunohistochemical staining for H3K27M was compared to tumor genotype, and also compared to H3 tri-methylated lysine 27 (H3K27me3) staining, previously shown to be drastically decreased in samples carrying this mutation. There was a 100 % concordance between genotype and immunohistochemical analysis of H3K27M in tumor samples. Mutant H3K27M was expressed in the majority of tumor cells, indicating limited intra-tumor heterogeneity for this specific mutation within the limits of our dataset. Both H3.1 and H3.3K27M mutants were recognized by this antibody while non-neoplastic elements, such as endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells or lymphocytes, did not stain. H3K27me3 immunoreactivity was largely mutually exclusive with H3K27M positivity. These results demonstrate that mutant H3K27M can be specifically identified with high specificity and sensitivity using an H3K27M antibody and immunohistochemistry. Use of this antibody in the clinical setting will prove very useful for diagnosis, especially in the context of small biopsies in challenging midline tumors and will help orient care in the context of the extremely poor prognosis associated with this mutation.

Leptin modulates the late fever response to LPS in diet-induced obese animals	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						Leptin; Fever; Cytokines; Obesity	LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-INDUCED FEVER; PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES; BINDING-PROTEIN; C/EBP-BETA; RAT-BRAIN; INTERLEUKIN-6 EXPRESSION; LOCALIZED INFLAMMATION; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; NUCLEAR FACTOR	Leptin is an important modulator of both inflammation and energy homeostasis, making it a key interface between the inflammatory response to pathogenic stimuli and the energy status of the host. In previous studies we demonstrated that sickness responses to systemic immune challenge, including fever, are significantly exacerbated in diet induced obese animals. To investigate whether this exacerbation is functionally linked to the obesity associated increase in circulating levels of leptin, a species-specific leptin antiserum (LAS) was used to neutralize endogenous leptin in diet-induced obese adult male Wistar rats treated with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 mu g/kg). LAS significantly reduced the magnitude of the later phases of the fever response, and attenuated the circulating levels of IL-6, IL-1ra and bioactivity of leptin in the obese animals. In addition, the antiserum significantly attenuated the hypothalamic expression of IL-1 beta, I kappa B alpha, COX2, SOCS3 and IL-6 in both lean and obese rats 10 h after the LPS injection and NF-IL6 in the hypothalamus of obese rats only. The relatively late rise in brain IL-6 suggested a role in mediating the extended fever response in obese animals and we tested this by neutralizing brain IL-6 using an IL6-AS injected intracerebroventricularly (4 mu l, icv). The IL6-AS significantly but transiently (between 9 h and 12 h post LPS) reduced the late fever response of obese rats. These results demonstrate that leptin plays an important part in modulating the late portion of the fever response to LPS, likely through the induction of hypothalamic IL-6 in obese animals.

Here, we report a novel disorder in three adult patients with a phenotype including cataracts, short-stature secondary to growth hormone deficiency, sensorineural hearing deficit, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and skeletal dysplasia. Using SNP genotyping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a single likely causal variant, a missense mutation in a conserved residue of the nuclear gene IARS2, encoding mitochondrial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. The mutation is homozygous in the affected patients, heterozygous in carriers, and absent in control chromosomes. IARS2 protein level was reduced in skin cells cultured from one of the patients, consistent with a pathogenic effect of the mutation.

The molecular dynamics governing immune cell recruitment to sites of injury and disease in the CNS during sterile inflammation remain poorly defined. Here, we identified a subset of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) that responds to local chemotactic cues that are conserved among central neurons, vessels, and immune cells. Patients suffering from late-stage proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) had elevated vitreous semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A). Using a murine model, we found that SEMA3A acts as a potent attractant for neuropilin-1-positive (NRP-1-positive) MPs. These proangiogenic MPs were selectively recruited to sites of pathological neovascularization in response to locally produced SEMA3A as well as VEGF. NRP-1-positive MPs were essential for disease progression, as NRP-1-deficient MPs failed to enter the retina in a murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), a proxy for PDR. OIR mice with NRP-1-deficient MPs exhibited decreased vascular degeneration and diminished pathological preretinal neovascularization. Intravitreal administration of a NRP-1-derived trap effectively mimicked the therapeutic benefits observed in mice lacking NRP-1-expressing MPs. Our findings indicate that NRP-1 is an obligate receptor for MP chemotaxis, bridging neural ischemia to an innate immune response in neovascular retinal disease.

Mutational Analysis of the Genes Encoding RFAmide-Related Peptide-3, the Human Orthologue of Gonadotrophin-Inhibitory Hormone, and its Receptor (GPR147) in Patients with Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone-Dependent Pubertal Disorders	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						RFamide-related peptides; GPR147; hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism; precocious puberty; GnRH; GnIH	HYPOGONADOTROPIC HYPOGONADISM; NEUROENDOCRINE REGULATION; HYPOPHYSIOTROPIC ROLE; PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY; COGNATE RECEPTOR; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; SECRETION; CELLS; GNIH	RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3), the orthologue of avian gonadotrophin-inhibitory hormone, and its receptor GPR147 have been recently identified in the human hypothalamus, and their roles in the regulation of reproductive axis has been studied. The present study aimed to investigate whether the presence of variants in the genes encoding human RFRP-3 (NPVF gene) and its receptor, GPR147 (NPFFR1 gene), is associated with the occurrence of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-dependent pubertal disorders. Seventy-eight patients with idiopathic central precocious puberty (CPP) and 51 with normosmic isolated hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (nIHH) were investigated. Fifty healthy subjects comprised the control group. The coding sequences of the NPVF and NPFFR1 genes were amplified and sequenced. Odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate the likelihood of CPP or nIHH in the presence of the described polymorphisms. All such polymorphisms have already been registered in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. A three-nucleotide in frame deletion was identified in the NPVF gene (p.I71_K72), with a smaller proportion in the CPP (5%) compared to the nIHH (15%) group (P=0.06). This results in the deletion of the isoleucine at position 71, adjacent to lysine at an endoproteolytic cleavage site of the precursor peptide. This polymorphism was associated with a lower risk of CPP (OR=0.33; 95% confidence interval=0.08-0.88); interestingly, only two men with nIHH were homozygotes for this variant. A total of five missense polymorphisms were found in the NPFFR1 gene, which encodes GPR147, with similar frequencies among groups and no association with pubertal timing. Our data suggest that RFRP-3/GPR147 may play secondary, modulatory roles on the regulation of pubertal development; a restraining modulatory effect of the NPVF p.I71_K72 variant on the activation of the gonadotrophic axis cannot be ruled out and deserves further investigation.

FORGE Canada Consortium	Neuropathologic Features of Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 6	JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						PCH6; Pontocerebellar hypoplasia; RARS2; Whole-exome sequencing	MIGRATION; BRAIN; CELLS; GENE; MECHANISMS; MUTATIONS; VARIANTS	Pontocerebellar hypoplasia is a group of severe developmental disorders with prenatal onset affecting the growth and function of the brainstem and cerebellum. The rarity and genetic heterogeneity of this group of disorders can make molecular diagnosis challenging. We report 3 siblings who were born to nonconsanguineous parents, were hypotonic at birth, developed seizures, had repeated apneic spells, and died within 2 months of life. Neuroimaging showed that all had profound cerebellar hypoplasia and simplified cortical gyration. Genetic analysis by whole-exome sequencing demonstrated compound heterozygous mutations in the mitochondrial arginyl transfer RNA synthetase gene RARS2, indicating that the children had pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6. Autopsies on the younger twin siblings revealed small and immature cerebella at an approximate developmental age of less than 18 weeks. The basis pontis showed regressive changes, and the medulla had marked inferior olivary hypoplasia. The brains of both twins were microencephalic and had simplified gyri; cortices were immature, and deep white matter had extensive astrocytosis. The findings suggest a near-normal embryologic period followed by midgestation developmental slowing or cessation and later regression in select anatomic regions. This is the first detailed description of neuropathologic findings associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6 and demonstrates the profound effects of RARS2 disruption during early neurodevelopment.

Methods: Autozygosity mapping was performed in all affected individuals, followed by whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 2 individuals. Results: WES identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.916G>A, p.G306R) in the cerebral riboflavin transporter SLC52A2, recently shown to cause Brown-Vialetto-Van-Laere syndrome (BVVLS), which is considered primarily a motor neuronopathy. Our patients have a phenotype distinct from BVVLS, characterized by severe progressive sensory loss mainly affecting vibration and proprioception that evolves to include sensorineural hearing loss in childhood, variable degrees of optic atrophy, and marked upper extremity weakness and atrophy. Treatment of 3 patients with 400 mg/day riboflavin over 3 months produced definite clinical improvement. Conclusions: Mutations in SLC52A2 result in a recognizable phenotype distinct from BVVLS. Early recognition of this disorder is critical, given its potential treatability.

Studies in socially monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) and other species have implicated oxytocin in partner preferences and other social behaviors. In the present study male prairie voles were injected intraperitoneally with either oxytocin or the selective oxytocin antagonist, L-368,899, and were assessed for object preference (for small inanimate toys) 30-min after injection. Object preferences were assessed in animals tested alone or in the presence of their sibling cage mate. Saline-treated controls displayed preferences for the novel object, both when tested alone and in pairs, while oxytocin-treated voles did not demonstrate an object preference, regardless of whether tested alone or in pairs. Finally, oxytocin antagonist treated voles showed preference for the novel object, but only when tested in pairs. These data support a possible involvement of oxytocin and oxytocin receptors in object preference. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is well-aligned with the objectives of CER, this design may not be feasible or applicable to all research questions, particularly those pertaining to clinical decision making and individually based change. It is important, therefore, to consider alternative approaches, especially when studying complex and subjective outcomes such as children's participation. We propose the use of interrupted time series (ITS) quasi-experimental design for its potential application in determining the effectiveness of participation-focused interventions. In this perspective, ITS design is described, ascertaining its advantages and limitations, and suggestions are provided to overcome challenges to implementation. Results of a case study using the ITS approach to evaluate changes in participation of an adolescent with physical disabilities are described. Finally, strategies to implement this design in practice are suggested.

Systemic Inflammation Impairs Tissue Reperfusion Through Endothelin-Dependent Mechanisms in Cerebral Ischemia	STROKE			English	Article						brain ischemia; endothelin-1; inflammation; interleukin-1; magnetic resonance imaging; reperfusion	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; EXPERIMENTAL STROKE; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; DIABETIC-RATS; BLOOD-FLOW; THROMBOLYSIS; RECEPTOR; MICE; HYPOPERFUSION; INTERLEUKIN-1	Background and Purpose Systemic inflammation contributes to diverse acute and chronic brain pathologies, and extensive evidence implicates inflammation in stroke susceptibility and poor outcome. Here we investigate whether systemic inflammation alters cerebral blood flow during reperfusion after experimental cerebral ischemia. Methods Serial diffusion and perfusion-weighted MRI was performed after reperfusion in Wistar rats given systemic (intraperitoneal) interleukin-1 or vehicle before 60-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The expression and location of endothelin-1 was assessed by polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, and immunofluorescence. Results Systemic interleukin-1 caused a severe reduction in cerebral blood flow and increase in infarct volume compared with vehicle. Restriction in cerebral blood flow was observed alongside activation of the cerebral vasculature and upregulation of the vasoconstricting peptide endothelin-1 in the ischemic penumbra. A microthrombotic profile was also observed in the vasculature of rats receiving interleukin-1. Blockade of endothelin-1 receptors reversed this hypoperfusion, reduced tissue damage, and improved functional outcome. Conclusions These data suggest patients with a raised inflammatory profile may have persistent deficits in perfusion after reopening of an occluded vessel. Future therapeutic strategies to interrupt the mechanism identified could lead to enhanced recovery of penumbra in patients with a heightened inflammatory burden and a better outcome after stroke.

Centrally-administered oxytocin promotes preference for familiar objects at a short delay in ovariectomized female rats	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Novel object preference; Neuropeptide; Intracerebroventricular	VOLES MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER; PRAIRIE VOLES; PARTNER PREFERENCES; MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; DISAPPEARANCE; RECOGNITION; VASOPRESSIN; HORMONES; PLASMA	Oxytocin has been previously associated with social attachment behaviors in various species, however, most studies focused on partner preference in the socially-monogamous prairie vole. In these, oxytocin treatment was shown to promote partner preference, such that females receiving either central or pulsatile peripheral administration would spend more time with a familiar male. This behavioral outcome was blocked by oxytocin receptor antagonist treatment. The aim of the current study was to further explore the preference-inducing properties of oxytocin by examining its effects on object preference on ovariectomized female rats. In other words, we assessed whether these effects would apply to objects and if they would be persistent across species. Eight rats were infused with oxytocin into the left ventricle and object preference was assessed at two delays: 30 min and 4 h. At the 30 min delay, oxytocin-treated animals showed preference for the familiar object, whereas saline-treated controls exhibited preference for the novel object. At the 4 h delay, both groups showed novel-object preference. Our findings show that oxytocin modulates object preference in the female rat at a shorter delay, similar to the findings from partner-preference studies in the prairie vole, suggesting that the mechanisms driving object preference might be in part similar to those responsible for partner preference.

Monitoring the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) may help assess the level of diaphragm activity, but such monitoring results are difficult to interpret because reference values are lacking. The aim of this study was to describe EAdi values in critically ill children during a stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), from the acute to recovery phases, and to assess the impact of ventilatory support on EAdi. This was a prospective longitudinal observational study of children requiring mechanical ventilation for a parts per thousand yen24 h. EAdi was recorded using a validated method in the acute phase, before extubation, after extubation, and before PICU discharge. Fifty-five critically ill children were enrolled in the study. Median maximum inspiratory EAdi (EAdi(max)) during mechanical ventilation was 3.6 [interquartile range (IQR) 1.2-7.6] mu V in the acute phase and 4.8 (IQR 2.0-10.7) mu V in the pre-extubation phase. Periods of diaphragm inactivity (with no detectable inspiratory EAdi) were frequent during conventional ventilation, even with a low level of support. EAdi(max) in spontaneous ventilation was 15.4 (IQR 7.4-20.7) mu V shortly after extubation and 12.6 (IQR 8.1-21.3) mu V before PICU discharge. The difference in EAdi(max) between mechanical ventilation and post-extubation periods was significant (p < 0.001). Patients intubated mainly because of a lung pathology exhibited higher EAdi (p < 0.01), with a similar temporal increase. This is the first systematic description of EAdi evolution in children during their stay in the PICU. In our patient cohort, diaphragm activity was frequently low in conventional ventilation, suggesting that overassistance or oversedation is common in clinical practice. EAdi monitoring appears to be a helpful tool to detect such situations.

BackgroundMany patients in an intensive care unit may be unable to self-report their pain. In such cases, the use of observable indicators is recommended. Very little research has explored the validity of the use of behaviours and vital signs for pain assessment of neurocritically ill patients. DesignProspective repeated-measure within-subject observational design. MethodsA total of 43 postbrain surgery patients were video recorded before, during and 15minutes after a non-nociceptive (non-invasive blood pressure cuff inflation) and a nociceptive (turning) procedures. Their behaviours and vital signs were collected with a pre-tested behavioural checklist and a data collection computer connected to the bedside monitor. The patients' self-report of pain was obtained whenever possible. Data were collected between June-December in 2011. ResultsA larger number of pain-related behaviours were exhibited by participants during the nociceptive procedure compared with the non-nociceptive procedure supporting discriminant validation. Among vital signs, only respiratory rate differed significantly between the two procedures. Regarding criterion validation, only behaviours were positively correlated with self-reports of pain. ConclusionBehaviours were found valid indicators of pain in neurocritically ill patients after elective brain surgery. Fluctuations in vital signs may suggest the presence of pain, but their validity for such use is not supported. They should only be used in combination with other validated pain assessment methods.

It is also a target of learning, as nociceptive brain responses are shaped by learning processes. We combined an instrumental pain avoidance task with an axiomatic approach to assessing fMRI signals related to prediction errors (PEs), which drive reinforcement-based learning. We found that pain PEs were encoded in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a structure important for pain control and learning in animal models. Axiomatic tests combined with dynamic causal modeling suggested that ventromedial prefrontal cortex, supported by putamen, provides an expected value-related input to the PAG, which then conveys PE signals to prefrontal regions important for behavioral regulation, including orbitofrontal, anterior mid-cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices. Thus, pain-related learning involves distinct neural circuitry, with implications for behavior and pain dynamics.

Studies of the development and maturation of the NMJ have focused on events that are dependent on synaptic activity and that require the coordinated actions of nerve- and muscle-derived molecules with different targets and effects. More recently, perisynaptic Schwann cells-the glial cells at NMJs-have become an important focus of research. These glia concomitantly contribute to pre- and postsynaptic maturation while undergoing maturation themselves. Thus, an intricate 'danse a trois' regulates the maturation of the NMJ to form a highly efficient communication unit, in which fine glial processes lie in close proximity to a highly concentrated population of postsynaptic receptors and perfectly aligned presynaptic release sites.

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon require further elucidation. The present study investigated the influence of intranasal oxytocin on basic emotional processing in men and women, using an emotion-modulated startle response paradigm. Eighty-four participants self-administered 24IU of intranasal oxytocin or saline and completed an assessment of the acoustic startle reflex, using electromyography (EMG), with varying emotional foregrounds. Oxytocin had no impact on the affective modulation of the startle eye blink response, but significantly diminished the acoustic startle reflex irrespective of the emotional foreground. The results suggest that oxytocin facilitates prosocial behavior, in part, by attenuating basic physiological arousal. The dampening effect of oxytocin on EMG startle could possibly be used as an inexpensive marker of oxytocin's effect on limbic brain circuits.

Eye spy: The predictive value of fixation patterns in detecting subtle and extreme emotions from faces	COGNITION			English	Article						Emotion; Face perception; Expression; Modeling; Eye-tracking; Fixation	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; AMYGDALA DAMAGE; RECOGNITION TASKS; ATTENTION; AUTISM; LANGUAGE; INFORMATION; PERCEPTION; MECHANISM; SELECTION	Successful social interaction requires recognizing subtle changes in the mental states of others. Deficits in emotion recognition are found in several neurological and psychiatric illnesses, and are often marked by disturbances in gaze patterns to faces, typically interpreted as a failure to fixate on emotionally informative facial features. However, there has been very little research on how fixations inform emotion recognition in healthy people. Here, we asked whether fixations predicted detection of subtle and extreme emotions in faces. We used a simple model to predict emotion detection scores from participants' fixation patterns. The best fit of this model heavily weighted fixations to the eyes in detecting subtle fear, disgust and surprise, with less weight, or zero weight, given to mouth and nose fixations. However, this model could not successfully predict detection of subtle happiness, or extreme emotional expressions, with the exception of fear. These findings argue that detection of most subtle emotions is best served by fixations to the eyes, with some contribution from nose and mouth fixations. In contrast, detection of extreme emotions and subtle happiness appeared to be less dependent on fixation patterns. The results offer a new perspective on some puzzling dissociations in the neuropsychological literature, and a novel analytic approach for the study of eye gaze in social or emotional settings.

J	St-Jacques, B; Ma, WY				St-Jacques, Bruno; Ma, Weiya			Peripheral prostaglandin E2 prolongs the sensitization of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons possibly by facilitating the synthesis and anterograde axonal trafficking of EP4 receptors	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						PGE2; 16,16-dimethyl PGE2; COX2; EP receptor; Tactile allodynia; Intraplantar injection; Nociceptor; Sensitization; Dorsal root ganglion; Anterograde axonal transport	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; NA(V)1.8 SODIUM-CHANNEL; PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; IN-VIVO; MECHANICAL HYPERALGESIA; INFLAMMATION; ACTIVATION; EPSILON; TRPV1	Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a well-known pain mediator enriched in inflamed tissues, plays a pivotal role in the genesis of chronic pain conditions such as inflammatory and neuropathic pain. PGE2-prolonged sensitization of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (nociceptors) may contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that facilitating synthesis and anterograde axonal trafficking of EP receptors contribute to PGE2-prolonged nociceptor sensitization. Intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of a stabilized PGE2 analog, 16,16 dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2), in a dose- and time-dependent manner, not only elicited primary tactile allodynia which lasted for 1 d, but also prolonged tactile allodynia evoked by a subsequent i.pl. injection of dmPGE2 from 1 d to 4 d. Moreover, the duration of tactile allodynia was progressively prolonged following multiple sequential i.pl. injections of dmPGE2. Co-injection of the selective EM or EP4 receptor antagonist, the inhibitors of cAMP, PKA, PKC, PKC epsilon or PLC as well as an interleukin-6 (IL-6) neutralizing antiserum differentially blocked primary tactile allodynia elicited by the 1st dmPGE2 and the prolonged tactile allodynia evoked by the 2nd dmPGE2, suggesting the involvement of these signaling events in dmPGE2-induced nociceptor activation and sensitization. Co-injection of a selective COX2 inhibitor or two EP4 antagonists prevented or shortened inflammagen-prolonged nociceptor sensitization. I.pl. injection of dmPGE2 or carrageenan time-dependently increased EP4 levels in L4-6 DRG neurons and peripheral nerves. EP4 was expressed in almost half of IB4-binding nociceptors of L4-6 DRG. Taken together, our data suggest that stimulating the synthesis and anterograde axonal trafficking to increase EP4 availability at the axonal terminals of nociceptors is likely a novel mechanism underlying PGE2-prolonged nociceptor sensitization. Blocking COX2/PGE2/EP4 signaling at an earlier stage of inflammation or injury is crucial for preventing the transition from acute pain to a chronic state. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Brain Dev Cooperative Grp	Cortical Thickness Maturation and Duration of Music Training: Health-Promoting Activities Shape Brain Development	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						music; MRI; cortical thickness	AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; MRI DATA; NIH MRI; CHILDREN; REGISTRATION; PERFORMANCE; SURFACES; INNER	Objective: To assess the extent to which playing a musical instrument is associated with cortical thickness development among healthy youths. Method: Participants were part of the National Institutes of Health (NLH) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MET) Study of Normal Brain Development. This study followed a longitudinal design such that participants underwent MRI scanning and behavioral testing on up to 3 separate visits, occurring at 2-year intervals. MET, IQ, and music training data were available for 232 youths (334 scans), ranging from 6 to 18 years of age. Cortical thickness was regressed against the number of years that each youth had played a musical instrument. Next, thickness was regressed against an "Age x Years of Playing" interaction term. Age, gender, total brain volume, and scanner were controlled for in analyses. Participant ID was entered as a random effect to account for within-person dependence. False discovery rate correction was applied (p <.05). Results: There was no association between thickness and years playing a musical instrument. The "Age x Years of Playing" interaction was associated with thickness in motor, premotor, and supplementary motor cortices, as well as prefrontal and parietal cortices. Follow-up analysis revealed that music training was associated with an increased rate of thickness maturation. Results were largely unchanged when IQ and handedness were included as covariates. Conclusion: Playing a musical instrument was associated with more rapid cortical thickness maturation within areas implicated in motor planning and coordination, visuospatial ability, and emotion and impulse regulation. However, given the quasi-experimental nature of this study, we cannot rule out the influence of confounding variables.

A meta-analytic review of the impact of intranasal oxytocin administration on cortisol concentrations during laboratory tasks: Moderation by method and mental health	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Intranasal oxytocin; Cortisol; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Moderation; Stress	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; TEND-AND-BEFRIEND; BRAIN OXYTOCIN; ANXIETY DISORDERS; SOCIAL BEHAVIORS; RECEPTOR-BINDING; PLASMA OXYTOCIN; STRESS-RESPONSE; DOSE-RESPONSE	Background: A large body of research has examined the acute effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on social cognition and stress-regulation. While progress has been made with respect to understanding the effect of oxytocin administration on social cognition in clinical populations (e.g. autism, schizophrenia), less is known about its impact on the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis among individuals with a mental disorder. Method: We conducted a meta-analysis on the acute effect of intranasal oxytocin administration on the cortisol response to laboratory tasks. The search yielded eighteen studies employing a randomized, placebo-controlled design (k = 18, N = 675). Random-effects models and moderator analyses were performed using the metafor package for the statistical program R. Results: The overall effect size estimate was modest and not statistically significant (Hedges G = -0.151, p = 0.11) with moderate heterogeneity in this effect across studies (I-2 = 31%). Controlling for baseline differences in cortisol concentrations, moderation analyses revealed that this effect was larger in response to challenging laboratory tasks that produced a robust stimulation of the HPA-axis (Hedges g = -0.433, 95% CI[-0.841, -0.025]), and in clinical populations relative to healthy controls (Hedges g = -0.742, 95% CI[-1.405, -0.078]). Conclusion: Overall, oxytocin administration showed greater attenuation of the cortisol response to laboratory tasks that strongly activated the HPA-axis, relative to tasks that did not. The effect was more robust among clinical populations, suggesting possible increased sensitivity to oxytocin among those with a clinical diagnosis and concomitant social difficulties. These data support the view that oxytocin may play an important role in HPA dysfunction associated with psychopathology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; pain; behaviors; pain assessment; intensive care unit	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; MECHANICALLY VENTILATED PATIENTS; CRITICALLY-ILL ADULTS; OBSERVATION TOOL; SEDATED PATIENTS; SCALE; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION; PREVALENCE; INDICATORS	Purpose: Pain behaviors such as grimacing and muscle rigidity are recommended for pain assessment in nonverbal populations. However, these behaviors may not be appropriate for critically ill patients with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) depending on their level of consciousness (LOC). This study aimed to validate the use of behaviors for assessing pain of critically ill TBI adults with different LOC. Methods: Using a repeated measure within subject design, participants (N = 45) were observed for 1 minute before (baseline), during, and 15 minutes after 2 procedures: (1) noninvasive blood pressure: NIBP (non-nociceptive); and (2) turning (nociceptive). A behavioral checklist combining 50 items from existing pain assessment tools and video recording were used to describe participants' behaviors. Intrarater and interrater agreements of observed behaviors were also examined. Results: Overall, pain behaviors were observed more frequently during turning (median = 4; T = -5.336; P <= 0.001) than at baseline (median = 1), or during noninvasive blood pressure (median = 0). TBI patients' pain behaviors were mostly "atypical" and included uncommon responses such as flushing, sudden eye opening, eye weeping, and flexion of limbs. These behaviors were observed in >= 25.0% of TBI participants during turning independent of their LOC, and in 22.2% to 66.7% of conscious participants who reported the presence of pain. Agreements were > 92% among and between the 2 raters. Conclusions: This study support previous findings that critically ill TBI patients could exhibit atypical behaviors when exposed to nociceptive procedures. As such, use of current recommended pain behaviors as part of standardized scales may not be optimal for assessing the analgesic needs of this vulnerable group.

Medial Prefrontal Cortical Estradiol Rapidly Alters Memory System Bias in Female Rats: Ultrastructural Analysis Reveals Membrane-Associated Estrogen Receptors as Potential Mediators	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR-30; BETA IMMUNOREACTIVITY; ALPHA; BRAIN; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; DOPAMINE; NEURONS; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION	High plasma levels of estradiol (E2) are associated with use of a place memory system over a response memory system. We examined whether infusing estradiol into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or anterior cingulate cortex (AC) could affect memory system bias in female rats. We also examined the ultrastructural distribution of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, ER beta,and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) in the mPFC of female rats as a mechanism for the behavioral effects of E2 in the mPFC. Each rat was infused bilaterally with either E2 (0.13 mu g) or vehicle into the mPFC or AC. The majority of E2 mPFC rats used place memory. In contrast, the majority of mPFC vehicle rats and AC E2 or vehicle rats used response memory. These data show that mPFC E2 rapidly biases females to use place memory. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that ER alpha, ER beta, and GPER1 are localized in the mPFC, almost exclusively at extranuclear sites. This is the first time that GPER1 has been localized to the mPFC of rats and the first time that ER alpha and ER beta have been described at extranuclear sites in the rat mPFC. The majority of receptors were observed on axons and axon terminals, suggesting that estrogens alter presynaptic transmission in the mPFC. This provides a mechanism via which ERs could rapidly alter transmission in the mPFC to alter PFC-dependent behaviors, such as memory system bias. The discrete nature of immunolabeling for these membrane-associated ERs may explain the discrepancy in previous light microscopy studies.

Identification of a homozygous splice site mutation in the dynein axonemal light chain 4 gene on 22q13.1 in a large consanguineous family from Pakistan with congenital mirror movement disorder	HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							SEQUENCING DATA; PROJECTIONS; DNA	Mirror movements (MRMV) are involuntary movements on one side of the body that mirror voluntary movements on the opposite side. Congenital mirror movement disorder is a rare, typically autosomal-dominant disorder, although it has been suspected that some sporadic cases may be due to recessive inheritance. Using a linkage analysis and a candidate gene approach, two genes have been implicated in congenital MRMV disorder to date: DCC on 18q21.2 (MRMV1), which encodes a netrin receptor, and RAD51 on 15q15.1 (MRMV2), which is involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here, we describe a large consanguineous Pakistani family with 11 cases of congenital MRMV disorder reported across five generations, with autosomal recessive inheritance likely. Sanger sequencing of DCC and RAD51 did not identify a mutation. We then employed microarray genotyping and autozygosity mapping to identify a shared region of homozygosity-by-descent among the affected individuals. We identified a large autozygous region of similar to 3.3 Mb on chromosome 22q13.1 (Chr22:36605976-39904648). We used Sanger sequencing to exclude several candidate genes within this region, including DMC1 and NPTXR. Whole exome sequencing was employed, and identified a splice site mutation in the dynein axonemal light chain 4 gene, DNAL4. This splice site change leads to skipping of exon 3, and omission of 28 amino acids from DNAL4 protein. Linkage analysis using Simwalk2 gives a maximum Lod score of 6.197 at this locus. Whether or how DNAL4 function may relate to the function of DCC or RAD51 is not known. Also, there is no suggestion of primary ciliary dyskinesis, situs inversus, or defective sperm in affected family members, which might be anticipated given a putative role for DNAL4 in axonemal-based dynein complexes. We suggest that DNAL4 plays a role in the cytoplasmic dynein complex for netrin-1-directed retrograde transport, and in commissural neurons of the corpus callosum in particular. This, in turn, could lead to faulty cross-brain wiring, resulting in MRMV.

The present research explores the role that could be assigned to BRCA1 SNPs to inactivate BRCA1 protein and therefore to the occurrence of familial breast cancer with an increased risk of distant metastases' occurrence. The presence or the absence of BRCA1 protein was first analyzed by applying the immunohistochemistry technique to the tumors with sporadic and familial breast cancer. Then, a case-control study was conducted including 40 patients with familial breast cancer, 46 ones with sporadic breast cancer and 34 healthy controls based on the genotyping of nine BRCA1 SNPs (c. 442.58delT, c. 2082C>T, c. 2311T>C, c. 2612C>T, c. 3113A>G, c. 3119G>A, c. 3548A>G, c. 4308T>C and 4837A>G) via direct sequencing. Finally, the functional role that could be assigned to these SNPs was focused upon. miRbase site was used as a bioinformatics tool to predict potential micro-RNAs (miRs) targeting SNPs that are associated with familial breast cancer according to the results of this research. These predicted miRs were confirmed by Q-PCR analysis and correlated with BRCA1 protein expression among patients along with potential distant metastases. Clinical outcome showed that distant metastasis concerned 45 % of familial breast cancer patients and 19.5 % with sporadic breast cancer. Analysis of BRCA1 protein expression revealed a negative staining among 46.6 % of familial breast cancer patients and only 16.6 % within sporadic breast cancer ones. The association of four variants was identified within BRCA1 gene (c. 442.58 delT, c. 2311T>C, c. 2612C>T and c. 4308T>C) to familial breast cancer across their wild genotypes. miR1179 was selected as potential miR that targets the region of BRCA1 mRNA containing the c. 2311T>C variant within the TT genotype. The expression of miR-1179 was significantly associated with familial breast cancer patients without BRCA1 deleterious mutations compared to those with sporadic breast cancer according to TT genotype along with BRCA1 negative staining and according to the occurrence of distant metastases. Combination between TT genotype of c. 2311T>C and miR-1179 over-expression could generate a lack of BRCA1 protein leading to a high risk of familial breast cancer with distant metastases.

In 3-D structure-from-motion (SFM) perception, motion and depth information are first extracted in this visual stream to allow object categorization, which is in turn mediated by the ventral visual stream. Such interplay justifies the use of SFM paradigms to understand dorsal-ventral integration of visual information. The nature of such processing is particularly interesting to be investigated in a neurological model of cognitive dissociation between dorsal (impaired) and ventral stream (relatively preserved) processing, Williams syndrome (WS). In the current fMRI study, we assessed dorsal versus ventral stream processing by using a performance-matched 3-D SFM object categorization task. We found evidence for substantial reorganization of the dorsal stream in WS as assessed by whole-brain ANOVA random effects analysis, with subtle differences in ventral activation. Dorsal reorganization was expressed by larger medial recruitment in WS (cuneus, precuneus, and retrosplenial cortex) in contrast with controls, which showed the expected dorsolateral pattern (caudal intraparietal sulcus and lateral occipital cortex). In summary, we found a substantial reorganization of dorsal stream regions in WS in response to simple visual categories and 3-D SFM perception, with less affected ventral stream. Our results corroborate the existence of a medial dorsal pathway that provides the substrate for information rerouting and reorganization in the presence of lateral dorsal stream vulnerability. This interpretation is consistent with recent findings suggesting parallel routing of information in medial and lateral parts of dorsal stream.

We describe a novel myositis-overlap syndrome in 4 patients characterized by the presence of a unique immunologic marker, autoantibodies to nuclear pore complexes. The clinical phenotype was characterized by prominent myositis in association with erosive, anti-CCP, and rheumatoid factor-positive arthritis, trigeminal neuralgia, mild interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, and weight loss. The myositis was typically chronic, relapsing, and refractory to corticosteroids alone, but remitted with the addition of a second immuno-modulating drug. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence for liver disease. The prognosis was good with 100% long-term survival (mean follow-up 19.5 yr). By indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells, sera from all 4 patients displayed a high titer of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA) with a distinct punctate peripheral (rim) fluorescent pattern of the nuclear envelope characteristic of nuclear pore complexes. Reactivity with nuclear pore complexes was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. In a cohort of 100 French Canadian patients with autoimmune myositis, the nuclear pore complex fluorescent ANA pattern was restricted to these 4 patients (4%). It was not observed in sera from 393 adult patients with systemic sclerosis (n = 112), mixed connective tissue disease (n = 35), systemic lupus (n = 94), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 45), or other rheumatic diseases (n = 107), nor was it observed in 62 normal adults. Autoantibodies to nuclear pore complexes were predominantly of IgG isotype. No other IgG autoantibody markers for defined connective tissue diseases or overlap syndromes were present, indicating a selective and highly focused immune response. In 3 patients, anti-nuclear pore complex autoantibody titers varied in parallel with myositis activity, suggesting a pathogenic link to pathophysiology. The nuclear pore complex proteins, that is, nucleoporins (nup), recognized by these sera were heterogeneous and included Nup358/RanBP2 (n = 2 patients), Nup90 (n = 1), Nup62 (n = 1), and gp210 (n = 1). Taken together the data suggest that nup autoantigens themselves drive the anti-nup autoimmune response. Immunogenetically, the 4 patients shared the DQA1*0501 allele associated with an increased risk for autoimmune myositis. In conclusion, we report an apparent novel subset of autoimmune myositis in our population of French Canadian patients with connective tissue diseases. This syndrome is recognized by the presence of a unique immunologic marker, autoantibodies to nuclear pore complexes that react with nups, consistent with an "anti-nupsyndrome.''

Emotions arise when something important to us is at stake. Although many factors have been associated with healthy emotional regulation, the role of sleep in this process has been largely ignored. Recent studies, however, have begun to delineate how sleep critically affects emotional functioning. Nighttime sleep affects daytime mood, emotional reactivity and the capacity to regulate positive and negative emotions; conversely, daytime experiences affect sleep. Hence, there is a complex interplay between sleep and emotional regulation. The objective of this article is to examine this interplay in adults. This objective is addressed by utilizing a framework that identifies key aspects of the relationship between sleep and emotion. We propose that the connectivity between the emotional centers of the brain - the prefontal cortex and the amygdala - is in part dependent on the homeostatic sleep system such that connectivity between these brain networks is higher when rested and lower when sleep deprived. High connectivity drives more efficient executive functioning, while a disconnect leads to poor executive functioning capacity including emotional reactivity and impulsivity. The cognitive effects of the homeostatic system are couple with the mood regulation effects of the circadian system together dictating the degree to which one experiences emotional regulation or dysregulation. Further, the affective brain systems of individuals with clinical symptomology and/or pathology are suggested to be more vulnerable to homeostatic pressure and circadian lows or misalignment resulting in increased affective clinical symptomology. We review empirical evidence that supports this framework and explore the implications of this framework. Finally, we describe future directions for this type of work.

An improved prognostic index, the graded prognostic assessment (GPA) has been developed. Our hypothesis was that if the data from RTOG 9508 were poststratified by the GPA, the conclusions may vary. Methods and Materials: In this analysis, 252 of the 331 patients were evaluable by GPA. Of those, 211 had lung cancer. Breast cancer patients were excluded because the components of the breast GPA are not in the RTOG database. Multiple Cox regression was used to compare survival between treatment groups, adjusting for GPA. Treatment comparisons within subgroups were performed with the log-rank test. A free online tool (brainmetgpa.com) simplified GPA use. Results: The fundamental conclusions of the primary analysis were confirmed in that there was no survival benefit overall for patients with 1 to 3 metastases; however, there was a benefit for the subset of patients with GPA 3.5 to 4.0 (median survival time [MST] for WBRT + SRS vs WBRT alone was 21.0 versus 10.3 months, P = .05) regardless of the number of metastases. Among patients with GPA 3.5 to 4.0 treated with WBRT and SRS, the MST for patients with 1 versus 2 to 3 metastases was 21 and 14.1 months, respectively. Conclusions: This secondary analysis of predominantly lung cancer patients, consistent with the original analysis, shows no survival advantage for the group overall when treated with WBRT and SRS; however, in patients with high GPA (3.5-4), there is a survival advantage regardless of whether they have 1, 2, or 3 BM. This benefit did not extend to patients with lower GPA. Prospective validation of this survival benefit for patients with multiple BM and high GPA when treated with WBRT and SRS is warranted.

Emotion in the voice influences the way we scan emotional faces	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Speech; Prosody; Face; Eye-tracking; Emotion; Cross-modal	SPOKEN-WORD RECOGNITION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURAL EVIDENCE; SPEECH PROSODY; TIME-COURSE; PERCEPTION; INFORMATION; ATTENTION	Previous eye-tracking studies have found that listening to emotionally-inflected utterances guides visual behavior towards an emotionally congruent face (e.g., Rigoulot and Pell, 2012). Here, we investigated in more detail whether emotional speech prosody influences how participants scan and fixate specific features of an emotional face that is congruent or incongruent with the prosody. Twenty-one participants viewed individual faces expressing fear, sadness, disgust, or happiness while listening to an emotionally-inflected pseudoutterance spoken in a congruent or incongruent prosody. Participants judged whether the emotional meaning of the face and voice were the same or different (match/mismatch). Results confirm that there were significant effects of prosody congruency on eye movements when participants scanned a face, although these varied by emotion type; a matching prosody promoted more frequent looks to the upper part of fear and sad facial expressions, whereas visual attention to upper and lower regions of happy (and to some extent disgust) faces was more evenly distributed. These data suggest ways that vocal emotion cues guide how humans process facial expressions in a way that could facilitate recognition of salient visual cues, to arrive at a holistic impression of intended meanings during interpersonal events.

Thirty-five participants performed Meyer and Flenghi's step-test (eight of which performed regeneration release work), during which heart rate and oxygen consumption were measured. Two individualized models and a General ANFIS model that does not require individual calibration were developed. Results indicated the superior precision achieved with individualized ANFIS modelling (RMSE = 1.0 and 2.8 ml/kg min in laboratory and field, respectively). The analytical model outperformed the traditional linear calibration and Flex-HR methods with field data. The General ANFIS model's estimates of VO2 were not significantly different from actual field VO2 measurements (RMSE = 3.5 ml/kg min). With its ease of use and low implementation cost, the General ANFIS model shows potential to replace any of the traditional individualized methods for VO2 estimation from HR data collected in the field.

We examined, prospectively, the degree to which objective and subjective elements of PNMS explained variance in autism-like traits among offspring, and tested moderating effects of sex and PNMS timing in utero. Subjects were 89 (46F/43M) children who were in utero during the 1998 Quebec Ice Storm. Soon after the storm, mothers completed questionnaires on objective exposure and subjective distress, and completed the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) for their children at age 61/2. ASSQ scores were higher among boys than girls. Greater objective and subjective PNMS predicted higher ASSQ independent of potential confounds. An objective-by-subjective interaction suggested that when subjective PNMS was high, objective PNMS had little effect; whereas when subjective PNMS was low, objective PNMS strongly affected ASSQ scores. A timing-by-objective stress interaction suggested objective stress significantly affected ASSQ in first-trimester exposed children, though less so with later exposure. The final regression explained 43% of variance in ASSQ scores; the main effect of sex and the sex-by-PNMS interactions were not significant. Findings may help elucidate neurodevelopmental origins of non-clinical autism-like traits from a dimensional perspective. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To date, the predominant animal models used to investigate the role of P-gp have been the mouse and rat, which have two distinct genes, Abcb1a and Abcb1b. In contrast, the human has a single gene, ABCB1, for which only a single isoform has been validated. We and others have previously shown important differences between Abcb1a and Abcb1b, limiting the extrapolation from rodent findings to the human. Since the guinea pig has a relatively long gestation, hemomonochorial placentation and neuroanatomically mature offspring, it is more similar to the human, and may provide a more comparable model for investigating the regulation of P-gp in the brain and placenta, however, to date, the Abcb1 gene in the guinea pig remains to be characterized. The placenta and fetal brain are barrier sites that express P-gp and that play a critical role of protection of the fetus and the fetal brain from maternally administered drugs and other xenobiotics. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR (QPCR) to sequence the expressed isoforms of guinea pig Abcb1, we demonstrate that like the human, the guinea pig genome contains one gene for Abcb1 but that it is expressed as at least three different isoforms via alternative splicing and alternate exon usage. Further, we demonstrate that these isoforms are more closely related to human than to rat or mouse isoforms. This striking, overall similarity and evolutionary relatedness between guinea pig Abcb1 and human ABCB1 indicate that the guinea pig represents a relevant animal model for investigating the function and regulation of P-gp in the placenta and brain.

They result from a widespread thalamo-cortical loop and involve synchronous cortical networks that are still poorly understood. We investigated whether brain activity during spindles can be characterized by specific patterns of functional connectivity among cortical generators. For that purpose, we developed a wavelet-based approach aimed at imaging the synchronous oscillatory cortical networks from simultaneous MEG-EEG recordings. First, we detected spindles on the EEG and extracted the corresponding frequency-locked MEG activity under the form of an analytic ridge signal in the time-frequency plane (Zerouali et al., 2013). Secondly, we performed source reconstruction of the ridge signal within the Maximum Entropy on the Mean framework (Amblard et al., 2004), yielding a robust estimate of the cortical sources producing observed oscillations. Lastly, we quantified functional connectivity among cortical sources using phase-locking values. The main innovations of this methodology are (1) to reveal the dynamic behavior of functional networks resolved in the time-frequency plane and (2) to characterize functional connectivity among MEG sources through phase interactions. We showed, for the first time, that the switch from fast to slow oscillatory mode during sleep spindles is required for the emergence of specific patterns of connectivity. Moreover, we show that earlier synchrony during spindles was associated with mainly intra-hemispheric connectivity whereas later synchrony was associated with global long-range connectivity. We propose that our methodology can be a valuable tool for studying the connectivity underlying neural processes involving sleep spindles, such as memory, plasticity or aging.

Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that combinatorial strategies are key to unlocking the plasticity that is enabled by ChABC. Given this, we evaluated the anatomical and functional consequences of ChABC in a combinatorial approach that also included growth factor (EGF, FGF2 and PDGF-AA) treatments and daily treadmill training on the recovery of hindlimb locomotion in rats with mid thoracic clip compression SCI. Using quantitative neuroanatomical and kinematic assessments, we demonstrate that the combined therapy significantly enhanced the neuroanatomical plasticity of major descending spinal tracts such as corticospinal and serotonergic-spinal pathways. Additionally, the pharmacological treatment attenuated chronic astrogliosis and inflammation at and adjacent to the lesion with the modest synergistic effects of treadmill training. We also observed a trend for earlier recovery of locomotion accompanied by an improvement of the overall angular excursions in rats treated with ChABC and growth factors in the first 4 weeks after SCI. At the end of the 7-week recovery period, rats from all groups exhibited an impressive spontaneous recovery of the kinematic parameters during locomotion on treadmill. However, although the combinatorial treatment led to clear chronic neuroanatomical plasticity, these structural changes did not translate to an additional longterm improvement of locomotor parameters studied including hindlimb-forelimb coupling. These findings demonstrate the beneficial effects of combined ChABC, growth factors and locomotor training on the plasticity of the injured spinal cord and the potential to induce earlier neurobehavioral recovery. However, additional approaches such as stem cell therapies or a more adapted treadmill training protocol may be required to optimize this repair strategy in order to induce sustained functional locomotor improvement.

J	Lasry, O; Marcoux, J				Lasry, Oliver; Marcoux, Judith			The use of intravenous Milrinone to treat cerebral vasospasm following traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage	SPRINGERPLUS			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Vasospasm; Milrinone; Post-traumatic vasospasm	HEAD-INJURY; POSTTRAUMATIC VASOSPASM; PRACTICAL SCALE; BRAIN-INJURY; IN-VITRO; ARTERIES; COMA	Introduction: Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a common intracranial lesion after traumatic brain injury (TBI). As in aneurysmal SAH, cerebral vasospasm is a common cause of secondary brain injury and is associated with the thickness of traumatic SAH. Unfortunately, there is limited literature on an effective treatment of this entity. The vasodilatory and inotropic agent, Milrinone, has been shown to be effective in treating vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH. The authors hypothesized that this agent could be useful and safe in treating vasospasm following tSAH. Case descriptions: Case reports of 2 TBI cases from a level 1 trauma centre with tSAH and whom developed delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) are presented. Intravenous Milrinone treatment was provided to each patient following the "Montreal Neurological Hospital Protocol". Discussion and evaluation: Both patients had an improvement in their DINDs following the treatment protocol. There were no complications of treatment and the Glasgow Outcome Scores of the patients ranged from 4 to 5. Conclusion: This is the first report of the use of intravenous Milrinone to treat cerebral vasospasm following traumatic SAH. This treatment option appeared to be safe and potentially useful at treating post-traumatic vasospasm. Prospective studies are necessary to establish Milrinone's clinical effectiveness in treating this type of cerebral vasospasm.

Sex- and age-differences in blood manganese levels in the US general population: national health and nutrition examination survey 2011-2012	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Blood manganese; Sex; Age; Population survey; NHANES	DRINKING-WATER; EXPOSURE; WOMEN; ABSORPTION; IRON; GUIDELINE; RETENTION; FORMULAS; CHILDREN; INFANTS	Background: Manganese is an essential element, but excessive manganese exposure has neurotoxic effects. Objective: To examine blood manganese levels in the general population with respect to sex, age, race/ethnicity, pregnancy and menauposal status, as well as levels of trace elements in blood. Methods: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a national survey of U.S. residents (n = 7720 participants, ages 1 to 80 years). General linear models and generalized additive models were used to examine the association between blood manganese concentration and participants' characterisics, accounting for the complex survey design. Results: Blood manganese levels ranged from 1.6 to 62.5 mu g/L, with arithmetic means of 10.6 and 9.2 mu g/L for women and men, respectively. The following characteristics were significantly associated with higher blood manganese levels: female sex, younger age, Asian origin, and being pregnant. In addition, there were non-linear relationships between blood manganese levels and cadmium, iron, lead, and mercury levels. Conclusion: The higher blood manganese levels observed among females suggest sex-related metabolic differences in the regulation of manganese, and elevated levels among pregnant women suggest an important role of manganese in reproduction. The present study supports the need to take into consideration age- and sex-related differences in blood manganese levels, as well as pregnancy status when examining manganese essentiality or toxicity.

Results: smARF induces Parkin/PINK1-mitochondrial autophagy in neurons. Conclusion: smARF is upstream of Parkin and PINK1 in mitochondrial autophagy. Significance: Parkin/PINK1-mitochondrial autophagy can be triggered by intrinsic signaling. Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Multiple genes have been associated with PD, including Parkin and PINK1. Recent studies have established that the Parkin and PINK1 proteins function in a common mitochondrial quality control pathway, whereby disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential leads to PINK1 stabilization at the mitochondrial outer surface. PINK1 accumulation leads to Parkin recruitment from the cytosol, which in turn promotes the degradation of the damaged mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy). Most studies characterizing PINK1/Parkin mitophagy have relied on high concentrations of chemical uncouplers to trigger mitochondrial depolarization, a stimulus that has been difficult to adapt to neuronal systems and one unlikely to faithfully model the mitochondrial damage that occurs in PD. Here, we report that the short mitochondrial isoform of ARF (smARF), previously identified as an alternate translation product of the tumor suppressor p19ARF, depolarizes mitochondria and promotes mitophagy in a Parkin/PINK1-dependent manner, both in cell lines and in neurons. The work positions smARF upstream of PINK1 and Parkin and demonstrates that mitophagy can be triggered by intrinsic signaling cascades.

Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 4 Regulates Growth Cone Dynamics through the Actin and Microtubule Cytoskeleton	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Axon; Cell Biology; Cytoskeleton; Microfilaments; Microtubule; Neurodevelopment; Neuroscience; CRMP; Growth Cone	AXON OUTGROWTH INHIBITION; F-ACTIN; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; SHORT-STOP; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; BINDING PROTEIN; MOTOR-NEURONS; GUIDANCE CUE; PHOSPHORYLATION; CRMP-2	Background: Intricate regulation of the growth cone cytoskeleton controls growth cone dynamics. Results: Loss of CRMP4 disrupts growth cone cytoskeletal dynamics, growth cone expansion, and axon growth. Conclusion: CRMP4 regulates both the actin and microtubule growth cone cytoskeleton. Significance: CRMP4 plays a critical role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics underlying growth cone properties. Coordinated control of the growth cone cytoskeleton underlies axon extension and guidance. Members of the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family of cytosolic phosphoproteins regulate the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton, but their roles in regulating growth cone dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine how CRMP4 regulates the growth cone cytoskeleton. Hippocampal neurons from CRMP4-/- mice exhibited a selective decrease in axon extension and reduced growth cone area, whereas overexpression of CRMP4 enhanced the formation and length of growth cone filopodia. Biochemically, CRMP4 can impact both microtubule assembly and F-actin bundling in vitro. Through a structure function analysis of CRMP4, we found that the effects of CRMP4 on axon growth and growth cone morphology were dependent on microtubule assembly, whereas filopodial extension relied on actin bundling. Intriguingly, anterograde movement of EB3 comets, which track microtubule protrusion, slowed significantly in neurons derived from CRMP4-/- mice, and rescue of microtubule dynamics required CRMP4 activity toward both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Together, this study identified a dual role for CRMP4 in regulating the actin and microtubule growth cone cytoskeleton.

SLAGEN Consortium	Exome-wide Rare Variant Analysis Identifies TUBA4A Mutations Associated with Familial ALS	NEURON			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; PROGRESSIVE-MOTOR-NEURONOPATHY; NEURONAL MIGRATION; ALPHA-TUBULIN; CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; MISSENSE MUTATION; COMPLEX TRAITS; GENE; DISEASE; MICROTUBULES	Exome sequencing is an effective strategy for identifying human disease genes. However, this methodology is difficult in late-onset diseases where limited availability of DNA from informative family members prohibits comprehensive segregation analysis. To overcome this limitation, we performed an exome-wide rare variant burden analysis of 363 index cases with familial ALS (FALS). The results revealed an excess of patient variants within TUBA4A, the gene encoding the Tubulin, Alpha 4A protein. Analysis of a further 272 FALS cases and 5,510 internal controls confirmed the overrepresentation as statistically significant and replicable. Functional analyses revealed that TUBA4A mutants destabilize the microtubule network, diminishing its repolymerization capability. These results further emphasize the role of cytoskeletal defects in ALS and demonstrate the power of gene-based rare variant analyses in situations where causal genes cannot be identified through traditional segregation analysis.

One hypothesis is that stress alters circadian protein expression in the forebrain, leading to functional dysregulation of the brain circadian network and consequent disruption of circadian physiological and behavioral rhythms. Here we characterized the effects of several different stressors on the expression of the core clock protein, PER1 and the activity marker, FOS in select forebrain and hypothalamic nuclei in rats. We found that acute exposure to processive stressors, restraint and forced swim, elevated PER1 and FOS expression in the paraventricular and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei and piriform cortex but suppressed PER1 and FOS levels exclusively in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEAI) and oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov). Conversely, systemic stressors, interleukin-1 beta and 2-Deoxy-D-glucose, increased PER1 and FOS levels in all regions studied, including the CEAI and BNSTov. PER1 levels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master pacemaker, were unaffected by any of the stress manipulations. The effect of stress on PER1 and FOS was modulated by time of day and, in the case of daily restraint, by predictability. These results demonstrate that the expression of PER1 in the forebrain is modulated by stress, consistent with the hypothesis that PER1 serves as a link between stress and the brain circadian network. Furthermore, the results show that the mechanisms that control PER1 and FOS expression in CEAI and BNSTov are uniquely sensitive to differences in the type of stressor. Finally, the finding that the effect of stress on PER1 parallels its effect on FOS supports the idea that Per1 functions as an immediate-early gene. Our observations point to a novel role for PER1 as a key player in the interface between stress and circadian rhythms.

The performance of a group of 26 Italian participants with Alzheimer's disease was studied in a semantic judgment task and a syntactic judgment task. Results were analyzed by means of mixed-effect models, revealing an interaction between task and stimulus category: The probability for correct responses to mass stimuli was significantly lower than that for count stimuli, but only in the semantic task. These findings confirm the major semantic impairment in dementia and suggest that mass nouns have particular features that make them more prone to impairment than count nouns for a progressively degenerating brain.

Contact repulsion by membrane-associated ephrins and Eph receptors was proposed to be facilitated by ectodomain cleavage, but whether this phenomenon is required for axon guidance in vivo is unknown. Results: In support of established models, we find that cleavage of EphA4 promotes cell-cell and growth cone-cell detachment in vitro. Unexpectedly, however, a cleavage resistant isoform of EphA4 is as effective as a wild-type EphA4 in redirecting motor axons in limbs. Mice in which EphA4 cleavage is genetically abolished have motor axon guidance defects, suggesting an important role of EphA4 cleavage in nonneuronal tissues such as the limb mesenchyme target of spinal motor neurons. Indeed; we find that blocking EphA4 cleavage increases expression of full-length EphA4 in limb nnesenchyme, which-ia cis-attenuation-apparently reduces the effective concentration of ephrinAs capable of triggering EphA4 forward signaling in the motor axons. Conclusions: We propose that EphA4 cleavage is required to establish the concentration differential of active ephrins in the target tissue that is required for proper axon guidance. Our study reveals a novel mechanism to regulate guidance decision at an intermediate target based on the modulation of ligand availability by the proteolytic processing of the receptor.

Doublecortin Recognizes the Longitudinal Curvature of the Microtubule End and Lattice	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							ALPHA-BETA-TUBULIN; PLUS-END; 3-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE; DYNAMIC INSTABILITY; NEURONAL MIGRATION; URACIL-EXCISION; GTP HYDROLYSIS; IN-VITRO; PROTEIN; GROWTH	Background: Microtubule ends have distinct biochemical and structural features from those of the lattice. Several proteins that control microtubule behavior can distinguish the end of a microtubule from the lattice. The end-binding protein EB1, for example, recognizes the nucleotide state of microtubule ends, which are enriched in GTP-tubulin. EB1 shares its binding site with Doublecortin (DCX), a protein expressed in developing neurons. We showed recently that DCX binds with highest affinity to microtubule ends. Results: Here we show that DCX recognizes microtubule ends by a novel mechanism based on lattice curvature. Using single-molecule microscopy, we show that DCX "comets" do not elongate at faster microtubule growth rates and DCX does not recognize two out of three GTP analogs. We demonstrate that DCX binds with higher affinity to curved microtubule lattices than to straight ones. We find that curvature recognition is a property of single DCX molecules. Straightening of protofilaments (pfs) at microtubule ends with paclitaxel significantly attenuates end-recognition by DCX, but not EB1. Mutations in DCX found in patients with double cortex syndrome disrupted curvature recognition. Conclusions: We propose a model in which DCX recognizes microtuhule ends through specific interactions with their structure. We conclude that microtubule ends have two distinct features that proteins can recognize independently, namely a structural feature related to curvature and nucleotide state.

Training Transfers the Limits on Perception from Parietal to Ventral Cortex	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; TEXTURE-DISCRIMINATION; CORTICAL AREA; ATTENTION; ORIENTATION; SPECIFICITY; MECHANISMS; PLASTICITY	Visually guided behavior depends on (1) extracting and (2) discriminating signals from complex retinal inputs, and these perceptual skills improve with practice [1]. For instance, training on aerial reconnaissance facilitated World War II Allied military operations [2]; analysts pored over stereoscopic photographs, becoming expert at (1) segmenting pictures into meaningful items to break camouflage from (noisy) backgrounds, and (2) discriminating fine details to distinguish V-weapons from innocuous pylons. Training is understood to optimize neural circuits that process scene features (e.g., orientation) for particular purposes (e.g., judging position) [3-6]. Yet learning is most beneficial when it generalizes to other settings [7,8] and is critical in recovery after adversity [9], challenging understanding of the circuitry involved. Here we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to infer the functional organization supporting learning generalization in the human brain. First, we show dissociable contributions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) versus lateral occipital (LO) circuits: extracting targets from noise is disrupted by PPC stimulation, in contrast to judging feature differences, which is affected by LO rTMS. Then, we demonstrate that training causes striking changes in this circuit: after feature training, identifying a target in noise is not disrupted by PPC stimulation but instead by LO stimulation. This indicates that training shifts the limits on perception from parietal to ventral brain regions and identifies a critical neural circuit for visual learning. We suggest that generalization is implemented by supplanting dynamic processing conducted in the PPC with specific feature templates stored in the ventral cortex.	[Chang, Dorita H.

Patients and Methods Patients with stage III-IV OPC enrolled onto Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trials 0129 or RTOG 0522 who had known tumor p16 status plus local, regional, and/or distant progression after receiving platinum-based chemoradiotherapy were eligible for a retrospective analysis of the association between tumor p16 status and overall survival (OS) after disease progression. Rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank; hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox models. Tests and models were stratified by treatment protocol. Results A total of 181 patients with p16-positive (n = 105) or p16-negative (n = 76) OPC were included in the analysis. Patterns of failure and median time to progression (8.2 v 7.3 months; P = .67) were similar for patients with p16-positive and p16-negative tumors. After a median follow-up period of 4.0 years after disease progression, patients with p16-positive OPC had significantly improved survival rates compared with p16-negative patients (2-year OS, 54.6% v 27.6%; median, 2.6 v 0.8 years; P < .001). p16-positive tumor status (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.74) and receipt of salvage surgery (HR, 0.48; 95% CI; 0.27 to 0.84) reduced risk of death after disease progression whereas distant versus locoregional progression (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.09) increased risk, after adjustment for tumor stage and cigarette pack-years at enrollment. Conclusion Tumor HPV status is a strong and independent predictor of OS after disease progression and should be a stratification factor for clinical trials for patients with recurrent or metastatic OPC.

There is now a wealth of evidence about the brain mechanisms involved in error processing. However the extent to which those mechanisms are engaged during the acquisition of new motor skills remains elusive. Here we examined rhythm synchronization learning across 12 blocks of practice in musically naive individuals and tracked changes in ERP signals associated with error-monitoring and error-awareness across distinct learning stages. Synchronization performance improved with practice and performance improvements were accompanied by dynamic changes in ERP components related to error-monitoring and error-awareness. Early in learning when performance was poor and the internal representations of the rhythms were weaker we observed a larger error-related negativity (ERN) following errors compared to later learning. The larger ERN during early learning likely results from greater conflict between competing motor responses leading to greater engagement of medial-frontal conflict monitoring processes and attentional control. Later in learning when performance had improved we observed a smaller ERN accompanied by an enhancement of a centroparietal positive component resembling the P3. This centroparietal positive componentwas predictive of participant's performance accuracy suggesting a relation between error saliency error awareness and the consolidation of internal templates of the practiced rhythms. Moreover we showed that during rhythm learning errors led to larger auditory evoked responses related to attention orientation which were triggered automatically and which were independent of the learning stage. The present study provides crucial new information about how the electrophysiological signatures related to error-monitoring and error-awareness change during the acquisition of new skills extending previous work on error processing and cognitive control mechanisms to a more ecologically valid context.

At low difference frequencies, we perceive a single sound, which is moving across the head between the left and right ears. The percept changes to loudness fluctuation, roughness, and pitch with increasing beat rate. To examine the neural representations underlying these different perceptions, we recorded neuromagnetic cortical responses while participants listened to binaural beats at a continuously varying rate between 3 Hz and 60 Hz. Binaural beat responses were analyzed as neuromagnetic oscillations following the trajectory of the stimulus rate. Responses were largest in the 40-Hz gamma range and at low frequencies. Binaural beat responses at 3 Hz showed opposite polarity in the left and right auditory cortices. We suggest that this difference in polarity reflects the opponent neural population code for representing sound location. Binaural beats at any rate induced gamma oscillations. However, the responses were largest at 40-Hz stimulation. We propose that the neuromagnetic gamma oscillations reflect postsynaptic modulation that allows for precise timing of cortical neural firing. Systematic phase differences between bilateral responses suggest that separate sound representations of a sound object exist in the left and right auditory cortices. We conclude that binaural processing at the cortical level occurs with the same temporal acuity as monaural processing whereas the identification of sound location requires further interpretation and is limited by the rate of object representations.

A striking example is observed in light-sensing photoreceptors, in which the apical sensory cilium is subdivided into an inner and outer segment, each containing specific proteins essential for vision. It remains unclear, however, how such polarized protein localization is regulated. We report here that the endocytic adaptor protein Numb localizes to the inner, but not the outer segment of mouse photoreceptor cilia. Rod photoreceptor-specific inactivation of numb in vivo leads to progressive photoreceptor degeneration, indicating an essential role for Numb in photoreceptor cell biology. Interestingly, we report that loss of Numb in photoreceptors does not affect the localization of outer segment disk membrane proteins, such as rhodopsin, Peripherin-rds, Rom-1, and Abca4, but significantly disrupts the localization of the rod cyclic nucleotide-gated (Cng) channels, which accumulates on the inner segment plasma membrane in addition to its normal localization to the outer segments. Mechanistically, we show that Numb interacts with both subunits of the Cng channel and promotes the trafficking of Cnga1 to the recycling endosome. These results suggest a model in which Numb prevents targeting of Cng channels to the inner segment, by promoting their trafficking through the recycling endosome, where they can be sorted for specific delivery to the outer segment. This study uncovers a novel mechanism regulating polarized protein delivery in light-sensing cilia, raising the possibility that Numb plays a part in the regulation of protein trafficking in other types of cilia.

The 2,4-diaminopyrimidine inhibitor GW2580 (9) has been previously reported as a highly selective low nanomolar TrkB/TrkC/CSF-1R inhibitor. In this study, fluorinated derivatives of 9 were designed, synthesized and evaluated in enzymatic assays. The highly potent inhibitor 10 was identified, which retained the selectivity profile of the non fluorinated lead compound 9, and the radiosynthesis of [F-18]10 was developed. The results obtained from the biological evaluation of 10 and the radiosynthesis of [F-18]10 support further investigation of this tracer as a potential PET imaging probe for TrkB/TrkC and CSF-1R.

Neurocognition in the Emergency Department after a Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Youth	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						acute; adolescents; children; concussion; neuropsychology	SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION; STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; RECOVERY	The early cognitive effects from a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are poorly understood in youth. The aim of this study was to examine acute neurocognitive functioning in children and adolescents who presented to the emergency department (ED) after an mTBI. Youth 8-17 years of age with an mTBI (n = 77; mean age, 13.6 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 13.0-14.2) and an orthopedic injury control (OIC) group (n = 28; mean age, 13.9 years; 95% CI, 13.1-14.7) underwent a very brief computerized neurocognitive assessment (four subtests from CNS Vital Signs) in a pediatric trauma hospital ED. The mTBI and OIC groups were not significantly different on age, gender, handedness, computer familiarity, race, median family income, pain rating scales, or time from injury to assessment. There were no significant differences between the mTBI and OIC groups for accuracy on immediate memory, delayed memory, and measures of attention and executive functioning. However, the mTBI group performed significantly worse than the OIC on nearly all measures of psychomotor speed and reaction time. Further, cognitive functioning appears to worsen as more time passes since the mTBI. Neurocognitive deficits are detectable in youth with an mTBI who present to the ED, despite having a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15/15 and normal neuroimaging (or their presentation does not warrant neuroimaging). Their profile appears to include preserved accuracy on cognitive measures, but at the expense of slower psychomotor speed and longer reaction time.

GABA neurotransmission is implicated in several developmental processes including neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Alteration in excitatory/inhibitory synaptic activities plays a critical role in epilepsy, thus here we investigated whether mutations in alpha 1 subunit of GABAA receptor may affect dendrite spine and GABAergic bouton formation. In particular, we examined the effects of three mutations of the GABRA1 gene (D219N, A322D and K353delins18X) that were found in a cohort of French Canadian families with genetic generalized epilepsy. We used a novel single-cell genetic approach, by preparing cortical organotypic cultures from GABRA1(flox/flox) mice and simultaneously inactivating endogenous GABRA1 and transfecting mutant alpha 1 subunits in single glutamatergic pyramidal cells and basket GABAergic interneurons by biolistic transfection. We found that GABRA1(-/-) GABAergic cells showed reduced innervation field, which was rescued by co-expressing alpha 1-A322D and alpha 1-WT but not alpha 1-D219N. We further found that the expression of the most severe GABRA1 missense mutation (alpha 1-A322D) induced a striking increase of spine density in pyramidal cells along with an increase in the number of mushroom-like spines. In addition, alpha 1-A322D expression in GABAergic cells slightly increased perisomatic bouton density, whereas other mutations did not alter bouton formation. All together, these results suggest that the effects of different GABA(A)R mutations on GABAergic bouton and dendritic spine formation are specific to the mutation and cannot be always explained by a simple loss-of-function gene model. The use of single cell genetic manipulation in organotypic cultures may provide a better understanding of the specific and distinct neural circuit alterations caused by different GABA(A) receptor subunit mutations and will help define the pathophysiology of genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes.

The relationship between these approaches is unknown, therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear, and the ideal stimulation site for a given technique is often ambiguous, limiting optimization of the stimulation and its application in further disorders. In this article, we identify diseases treated with both types of stimulation, list the stimulation sites thought to be most effective in each disease, and test the hypothesis that these sites are different nodes within the same brain network as defined by resting-state functional-connectivity MRI. Sites where DBS was effective were functionally connected to sites where noninvasive brain stimulation was effective across diseases including depression, Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, essential tremor, addiction, pain, minimally conscious states, and Alzheimer's disease. A lack of functional connectivity identified sites where stimulation was ineffective, and the sign of the correlation related to whether excitatory or inhibitory noninvasive stimulation was found clinically effective. These results suggest that resting-state functional connectivity may be useful for translating therapy between stimulation modalities, optimizing treatment, and identifying new stimulation targets. More broadly, this work supports a network perspective toward understanding and treating neuropsychiatric disease, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeted brain network modulation.

Aberrant activation of Shh signaling causes overproliferation of GCPs, leading to medulloblastoma. Although the Shh-binding protein Boc associates with the Shh receptor Ptch1 to mediate Shh signaling, whether Boc plays a role in medulloblastoma is unknown. Here, we show that BOC is upregulated in medulloblastomas and induces GCP proliferation. Conversely, Boc inactivation reduces proliferation and progression of early medulloblastomas to advanced tumors. Mechanistically, we find that Boc, through elevated Shh signaling, promotes high levels of DNA damage, an effect mediated by CyclinD1. High DNA damage in the presence of Boc increases the incidence of Ptch1 loss of heterozygosity, an important event in the progression from early to advanced medulloblastoma. Together, our results indicate that DNA damage promoted by Boc leads to the demise of its own coreceptor, Ptch1, and consequently medulloblastonna progression.

CONTRIBUTION OF I-h TO THE RELATIVE FACILITATION OF SYNAPTIC RESPONSES INDUCED BY CARBACHOL IN THE ENTORHINAL CORTEX DURING REPETITIVE STIMULATION OF THE PARASUBICULUM	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						parasubiculum; entorhinal cortex; acetylcholine; I-h; IKir; NMDA	MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; CA1 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; FREELY MOVING RATS; LAYER-II; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS; DENDRITIC EXCITABILITY; MUSCARINIC MODULATION; POSTRHINAL CORTICES; THETA-RHYTHM	Neurons in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex provide the hippocampus with the majority of its cortical sensory input, and also receive the major output projection from the parasubiculum. This puts the parasubiculum in a position to modulate the activity of entorhinal neurons that project to the hippocampus. These brain areas receive cholinergic projections that are active during periods of theta- and gamma-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate how cholinergic receptor activation affects the strength of repetitive synaptic responses at these frequencies in the parasubiculo-entorhinal pathway and the cellular mechanisms involved. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of rat layer II medial entorhinal neurons were conducted using an acute slice preparation, and responses to 5-pulse trains of stimulation at theta- and gamma-frequency delivered to the parasubiculum were recorded. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) suppressed the amplitude of single synaptic responses, but also produced a relative facilitation of synaptic responses evoked during stimulation trains. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor blocker APV did not significantly reduce the relative facilitation effect. However, the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (I-h) channel blocker ZD7288 mimicked the relative facilitation induced by CCh, suggesting that CCh-induced inhibition of Ih could produce the effect by increasing dendritic input resistance (Rin). Inward-rectifying and leak K+ currents are known to interact with Ih to affect synaptic excitability. Application of the K+ channel antagonist Ba2+ depolarized neurons and enhanced temporal summation, but did not block further facilitation of train-evoked responses by ZD7288. The I-h-dependent facilitation of synaptic responses can therefore occur during reductions in inward-rectifying potassium current (IKir) associated with dendritic depolarization. Thus, in addition to cholinergic reductions in transmitter release that are known to facilitate train-evoked responses, these findings emphasize the role of inhibition of I-h in the integration of synaptic inputs within the entorhinal cortex during cholinergically-induced oscillatory states, likely due to enhanced summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) induced by increases in dendritic Rin.

Morphine and Clonidine Combination Therapy Improves Therapeutic Window in Mice: Synergy in Antinociceptive but Not in Sedative or Cardiovascular Effects	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INTRACTABLE CANCER PAIN; SPINAL-CORD INJURY; INTRATHECAL MORPHINE; EPIDURAL CLONIDINE; ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; CESAREAN-SECTION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; PHASE-I; ANALGESIA; FENTANYL	Opioids are used to manage all types of pain including acute, cancer, chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Unfortunately, opioid-related adverse effects such as respiratory depression, tolerance, physical dependence and addiction have led to an underutilization of these compounds for adequate pain relief. One strategy to improve the therapeutic utility of opioids is to co-administer them with other analgesic agents such as agonists acting at alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(2)ARs). Analgesics acting at alpha(2)ARs and opioid receptors (ORs) frequently synergize when co-administered in vivo. Multimodal analgesic techniques offer advantages over single drug treatments as synergistic combination therapies produce analgesia at lower doses, thus reducing undesired side effects. This inference presumes, however, that the synergistic interaction is limited to the analgesic effects. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of alpha(2)AR/OR combination therapy in acute antinociception and in the often-undesired side effects of sedation and cardiovascular depression in awake unrestrained mice. Morphine, clonidine or their combination was administered by spinal or systemic injection in awake mice. Antinociception was determined using the warm water tail flick assay (52.5 degrees C). Sedation/motor impairment was evaluated using the accelerating rotarod assay and cardiovascular function was monitored by pulse oximetry. Data were converted to percent maximum possible effect and isobolographic analysis was performed to determine if an interaction was subadditive, additive or synergistic. Synergistic interactions between morphine and clonidine were observed in the antinociceptive but not in the sedative/motor or cardiovascular effects. As a result, the therapeutic window was improved, similar to 200-fold and antinociception was achieved at non-sedating doses with little to no cardiovascular depression. In addition, combination therapy resulted in greater maximum analgesic efficacy over either drug alone. These data support the utility of combination adrenergic/opioid therapy in pain management for antinociceptive efficacy with reduced side-effect liability.

The rapid invasion of cancer cells into the normal brain is a major cause of treatment failure, yet the mechanisms that regulate this process are poorly understood. We have identified a novel mechanism of brain cancer invasion. We show that downregulated in renal cell carcinoma (DRR), which is newly expressed in invasive gliomas, recruits AKT to focal adhesions. This DRR-induced pathological relocalization of AKT bypasses commonly altered upstream signaling events and leads to AKT activation and invasion. We also developed an oligonucleotide therapeutic that reduces DRR expression and prevents glioma invasion in an in vivo preclinical model of the disease. Our findings identify DRR as a novel GBM target and show that oligonucleotides targeting DRR is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of DRR-positive GBMs.	[Dudley, A.; Sater, M.; Le, P.

Besides altering MN synaptic drive, the removal of these inputs is liable to alter the synaptic noise and, thus, the variability of their tonic activity. Sensory afferents, which are a major source of common and/or synchronized inputs shared by several MNs, may also contribute to the coupling in the time and frequency domains (synchrony and coherence, respectively) observed when cross-correlation and coherence analyses are applied to the discharges of MN pairs. Surprisingly, no consistent changes in firing frequency, nor in synchrony and coherence were reported to affect the activity of 3 pairs of motor units (MUs) tested in a case of sensory polyradiculoneuropathy (SPRNP), leading to an irreversible loss of large diameter sensory afferents (Farmer et al., 1993). Such a limited sample, however, precludes a definite conclusion about the actual impact that a chronic loss of muscle and cutaneous afferents may have on the firing properties of human MUs. To address this issue, the firing pattern of 92 MU pairs was analyzed at low contraction force in a case of SPRNP leading similarly to a permanent loss of proprioceptive inputs. Compared with 8 control subjects, MNs in this patient tended to discharge with slightly shorter inter-spike intervals but with greater variability. Synchronous firing tended to occur more frequently with a tighter coupling in the patient. There was no consistent change in coherence in the 15-30 Hz frequency range attributed to the MN corticospinal drive, but a greater coherence was observed below 5 Hz and between 30 and 60 Hz in the patient. The possible origins of the greater irregularity in MN tonic discharges, the tighter coupling of the synchronous firing and the changes in coherence observed in the absence of proprioceptive inputs are discussed.

These patients are at elevated risk for clinical progression to AIDS and non-AIDS events. CD4+ T-cell depletion following infection and persistent immune activation can partially explain this low CD4+ T-cell recovery. Recent data suggest a link between the tryptophan oxidation pathway, immune activation and HIV disease progression based on overstimulation of the tryptophan oxidation pathway by HIV antigens and by interferon-gamma. This overstimulation reduces levels of circulating tryptophan, resulting in inflammation which has been implicated in the development of neurocognitive dysfunction. Niacin (vitamin B3) is able to control the excess tryptophan oxidation, correcting tryptophan depletion, and therefore represents an interesting strategy to improve CD4 recovery. We aim to design a crossover proof-of-concept study to assess supplementation with an extended-release form of niacin (Niaspan FCTTM) in combination with antiretroviral therapy, compared to antiretroviral therapy alone, on T-cell immune activation as defined by changes in the percentage of CD8+ CD38+ HLA-DR+ T-cells. Methods/Design: This randomized, open-label, interventional crossover study with an immediate versus deferred use of Niaspan FCT for 24 weeks will assess its ability to reduce immune activation and thus increase CD4 recovery in 20 HIV-infected individuals with suboptimal immune responses despite sustained virologic suppression. A substudy evaluating neurocognitive function will also be conducted. Discussion: This randomized trial will provide an opportunity to evaluate the potential benefit of oral extended-release niacin, a drug that can indirectly increase tryptophan, to reduce immune activation and in turn increase CD4+ T-cell recovery. The study will also allow for the evaluation of the impact of Niaspan FCT on neurocognitive function in HIV-infected individuals with suboptimal immune responses despite sustained virologic suppression.

J	Eugene, C; Laghaei, R; Mousseau, N				Eugene, Cindie; Laghaei, Rozita; Mousseau, Normand			Early oligomerization stages for the non-amyloid component of alpha-synuclein amyloid	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; A-BETA COMPONENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PROTEIN AGGREGATION; FIBRIL FORMATION; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; LEWY BODIES; TOXICITY; NAC; FIBRILLOGENESIS	In recent years, much effort has focused on the early stages of aggregation and the formation of amyloid oligomers. Aggregation processes for these proteins are complex and their non-equilibrium nature makes any experimental study very difficult. Under these conditions, simulations provide a useful alternative for understanding the dynamics of the early stages of oligomerization. Here, we focus on the non-A beta amyloid component (NAC) of the monomer, dimer, and trimer of alpha-synuclein, an important 35-residue sequence involved in the aggregation and fibrillation of this protein associated with Parkinson's disease. Using Hamiltonian and temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations combined with the coarse grained Optimized Potential for Efficient peptide structure Prediction potential, we identify the role of the various regions and the secondary structures for the onset of oligomerization. For this sequence, we clearly observe the passage from alpha-helix to beta-sheet, a characteristic transition of amyloid proteins. More precisely, we find that the NAC monomer is highly structured with two a-helical regions, between residues 2-13 and 19-25. As the dimer and trimer form, beta-sheet structures between residues 2-14 and 26-34 appear and rapidly structure the system. The resulting conformations are much more structured than similar dimers and trimers of beta-amyloid and amylin proteins and yet display a strong polymorphism at these early stages of aggregation. In addition to its inherent experimental interest, comparison with other sequences shows that NAC could be a very useful numerical model for understanding the onset of aggregation.

Methylmercruy (MeHg) is a known neurotoxicant, yet little is known about the risk of exposure for beluga whales. Selenium (Se) has been linked to demethylation of MeHg in cetaceans, but its role in attenuating Hg toxicity in beluga whales is poorly understood. The objective of this study is to explore relationships between Hg and Se concentrations and neurochemical biomarkers in different brain regions of beluga whales in order to assess potential neurotoxicological risk of Hg exposure in this population. Brain tissue was sampled from hunter-harvested beluga whales from the western Canadian Arctic in 2008 and 2010. Neurochemical and molecular biomarkers were measured with radioligand binding assays and quantitative PCR, respectively. Total Hg (Hg-T) concentration ranged from 2.6-113 mg kg(-1) dw in temporal cortex. Gamma-amminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)-R) binding in the cerebellum was negatively associated with Hg-T, MeHg and total Se (Se-T) concentrations (p <= 0.05). The expression of mRNA for GABA(A)-R subunit alpha 2 was negatively associated with Hg-T and MeHg (p <= 0.05). Furthermore, GABA(A)-R binding was positively correlated to mRNA expression for GABA(A)-R alpha 2 subunit, and negatively correlated to the expression of mRNA for GABA(A)-R a4 subunit (p <= 0.05). The expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) subunit 2b mRNA expression was negatively associated with iHglabile concentration in the cerebellum (p <= 0.05). Variation of molecular and/or biochemical components of the GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling pathways were associated with MeHg exposure in beluga whales. Our results show that MeHg exposure is associated with neurochemical variation in the cerebellum of beluga whales and Se may partially protect from MeHg-associated neurotoxicity.

The catalytic domain contains five helical domains (SLII-SLVI) that are organized by two three-way junctions. The III-IV-V junction is required for high-affinity binding of the substrate domain (SLI) through formation of a kissing loop interaction with SLV. Here, we determine the high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of a 47-nucleotide RNA containing the III-IV-V junction (J345). The J345 RNA adopts a Y-shaped fold typical of the family C three-way junctions, with coaxial stacking between stems III and IV and an acute angle between stems III and V. The NMR structure reveals that the core of the III-IV-V junction contains four stacked base triples, a U-turn motif, a cross-strand stacking interaction, an A-minor interaction, and a ribose zipper. In addition, the NMR structure shows that the cCUUGg tetraloop used to stabilize stem IV adopts a novel RNA tetraloop fold, different from the known gCUUGc tetraloop structure. Using Mn2+-induced paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, we identify six Mg2+-binding sites within J345, including one associated with the cCUUGg tetraloop and two with the junction core. The NMR structure of J345 likely represents the conformation of the III-IV-V junction in the context of the active VS ribozyme and suggests that this junction functions as a dynamic hinge that contributes to substrate recognition and catalysis. Moreover, this study highlights a new role for family C three-way junctions in long-range tertiary interactions.

Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and its polysialylated form (PSA-NCAM) participate in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation and plasticity. However, it remains unclear whether they contribute to dendritic retraction and synaptic disassembly. Cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to glutamate (5 mu M) showed a reduced MAP-2 (+) area in the absence of neuronal death 24 h after the insult. Concomitantly, synapse loss, revealed by decreased synaptophysin and postsynaptic density-95 cluster number and area, together with changes in NCAM and PSA-NCAM levels were found. Dendritic atrophy and PSA-NCAM reduction proved NMDA-receptor dependent. Live-imaging experiments evidenced dendritic atrophy 4 h after the insult; this effect was preceded by smaller NCAM clusters (1 h) and decreased surface and total PSA-NCAM levels (3 h). Simultaneously, total NCAM cluster number and area remained unchanged. The subsequent synapse disassembly (6 h) was accompanied by reductions in total NCAM cluster number and area. A PSA mimetic peptide prevented both the dendritic atrophy and the subsequent synaptic changes (6 h) but had no effect on the earliest synaptic remodeling (3 h). Thus, NCAM-synaptic reorganization and PSA-NCAM level decrease precede glutamate-induced dendritic atrophy, whereas the NCAM level reduction is a delayed event related to synapse loss.

Numerous studies have shown an association between bulimia nervosa (BN) and variations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF has also been linked to borderline personality disorder (BPD) and to such traits as reward dependence. We examined the extent to which BDNF methylation corresponded to bulimic or normal-eater status, and also to the presence of comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) and childhood abuse. Our sample consisted of 64 women with BN and 32 normal-eater (NE) control women. Participants were assessed for eating-disorder symptoms, comorbid psychopathology, and childhood trauma, and then they were required to provide blood samples for methylation analyses. We observed a significant site x group (BN vs. NE) interaction indicating that women with BN showed increases in methylation at specific regions of the BDNF promoter. Furthermore, examining effects of childhood abuse and BPD, we observed significant site x group interactions such that groups composed of individuals with childhood abuse or BPD had particularly high levels of methylation at selected CpG sites. Our findings suggest that BN, especially when co-occurring with childhood abuse or BPD, is associated with a propensity towards elevated methylation at specific BDNF promoter region sites. These findings imply that hypermethylation of the BDNF gene may be related to eating disorder status, developmental stress exposure, and comorbid psychopathology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In such situations, the use of valid behavioral pain scales is recommended. Objective: To validate the use of the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) with brain surgery adults in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Design: Repeated-measure within subject prospective design. Settings: Forty-three elective brain surgery patients of a Canadian university hospital participated. Method: Participants were video recorded and scored with the CPOT before, during and after a non-nociceptive (non-invasive blood pressure using cuff inflation) and a nociceptive (turning) procedure for a total of six assessments. Self-reports of pain were also obtained. Results: Discriminant validation was supported with higher mean CPOT scores during the nociceptive procedure compared with the non-nociceptive one. More participants reported higher pain intensity during turning compared with cuff inflation. Criterion validation was supported with a moderate positive correlation between self-reports of pain intensity and CPOT scores during turning. Interrater and intrarater reliability of CPOT scores through the viewing of participants' videos by two trained raters was supported with high Intraclass Correlation Coefficients. Conclusion: The CPOT appears to be valid for the detection of pain in elective brain surgery patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The paper summarizes findings concerning the developmental origins of physical aggression, opposition, defiance, rule breaking and theft before outlining the state of knowledge on the early neurodevelopmental mechanisms that may explain chronic antisocial behaviour. It is concluded that there is good evidence that preventing the development of chronic antisocial behaviour problems should start at conception, at the latest, and the main target should be pregnant women with a history of social adjustment problems. The time is ripe for investments in large collaborative experimental preventive interventions with at risk families starting during pregnancy with long term assessments of children's bio-psycho-social development.

They also show elevated levels of aggressive behaviour. While psychotic symptoms explain aggressive behaviour that is common during acute episodes, they do not explain such behaviour at other stages of illness or prior to illness onset. Three distinct types of offenders have been identified: individuals with a childhood onset of conduct disorder who display antisocial and aggressive behaviour both before and after schizophrenia onset; individuals with no history of conduct problems who begin engaging in aggressive behaviour as illness onsets; and individuals who after many years of illness engage in a severe physical assault. Little is known about the aetiology of the three types of offenders and about the neural mechanisms that initiate and maintain these behaviours. We hypothesize that schizophrenia preceded by conduct disorder is associated with a combination of genes conferring vulnerability for both disorders and altering the effects of environmental factors on the brain, and thereby, with a distinct pattern of abnormal neural development. By contrast, offending among adults with schizophrenia who have no history of such behaviour prior to illness may result from the changes in the brain that occur as illness onsets, and that are further altered by substance misuse, and/or by the progressive changes in the brain through adulthood that result from the illness and/or from the use of antipsychotic medications.

Genome-wide methylation studies in monozygotic (MZ) twins are providing insight into the extent of epigenetic variation that occurs, irrespective of genotype. However, little is known about the variability of DNA methylation patterns in adolescence, a period involving significant and rapid physical, emotional, social, and neurodevelopmental change. Here, we assessed genome-wide DNA methylation using the 450K Illumina BeadChip in a sample of 37 MZ twin pairs followed longitudinally since birth to investigate: 1) the extent of variation in DNA methylation in identical genetic backgrounds in adolescence and; 2) whether these variations are randomly distributed or enriched in particular functional pathways. We also assessed stability of DNA methylation over 3-6 months to distinguish stable trait-like and variable state-like genes. A pathway analysis found high within-pair variability in genes associated with development, cellular mechanisms, tissue and cell morphology, and various disorders. Test-retest analyses performed in a sub-sample of 8 twin pairs demonstrated enrichment in gene pathways involved in organismal development, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, and particular disorders. The variability found in functional gene pathways may plausibly underlie phenotypic differences in this adolescent MZ twin sample. Furthermore, we assessed stability of methylation over 3-6 months and found that some genes were stable while others were unstable, suggesting that the methylome remains dynamic in adolescence and that dynamic sites tend to be organized in certain gene pathways.

Previously, we reported that PON1 genotype was directly associated with neurodevelopment at age two, and that PON1 genotype may increase susceptibility to OP exposure. Objectives: We examined the relationships of maternal and child PON1 genotype and enzyme activity levels and neurodevelopment at school age and examined their interaction with maternal dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolite levels to investigate differential susceptibility to OP-related neurotoxicity. Methods: Participants were from the CHAMACOS longitudinal birth cohort of Latino families in an agricultural region of California. We measured DAP metabolites of OP pesticides in maternal and child urine samples, and analyzed PON1(192) and PON1(-108) genotypes and enzyme activity [arylesterase (ARYase), paraoxonase (POase)] in maternal and child blood. We examined their association with children's performance on the Conners' Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT) at 5 years (n=296) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) at 7 years (n=327). Results: Maternal and child PON1 genotype was not related to performance on K-CPT or WISC, although WISC scores tended to be lowest in children and children of mothers who carried the PON-108TT genotype. Pregnancy ARYase levels were positively associated with all WISC subscales (e.g., 4.0 point increase in Full Scale IQ per standard deviation increase in ARYase, 95% CI=1.6, 6.4), while pregnancy POase levels were positively associated with WISC Processing Speed only. Maternal PON1(-108) weakly modified the relationship of maternal DAPS and K-CPT scores (P-interaction = 0.21) and VVISC verbal IQ (P-interaction = 0.71). The association between DAPs and Full-Scale IQ was strongest for children of mothers with lowest-tertile ARYase levels (P-interaction= 0.27). This relationship held for both diethyl and dimethyl DAPs and for all subscales of the WISC. Conclusions: We extend our previous findings that PON1 genotype and enzyme levels may be directly related to performance on certain domains of neurodevelopment in school-age children. Lower maternal PON1 enzyme levels during pregnancy may also increase susceptibility of children to neurotoxicity from OP pesticide exposure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Participation in occupations is vital for learning and development. Children with disabilities are at risk for decreased participation. Purpose. The purpose of this study is to examine peer-reviewed literature about the participation-based experiences of children and youth with disabilities in activities outside of formal preschool and school academics. Method. A scoping review was conducted to examine research studies published between 1990 and 2012. Studies included participants from 2 to 18 years who had at least one physical or intellectual/cognitive disability. Findings. Forty-nine articles discussing 32 studies and three systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Perceptions of and influences on participation were important emerging themes about direct impacts on patterns of participation. A child or youth's level of functioning, activity level, level of enjoyment, and contextual factors were found to influence their level of successful participation. Implications. Occupational therapists can use the findings from this review to consider supports and barriers within interventions to enhance participation in meaningful life situations.

Elevated gene expression of glutamate receptors in noradrenergic neurons from the locus coeruleus in major depression	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Glutamate receptors; locus coeruleus; major depression; neurons; suicide	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; D-ASPARTATE ANTAGONIST; CATECHOLAMINE DEPLETION; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; CHRONIC STRESS; BRAIN; DISORDER; RAT; ACTIVATION; CERULEUS	Glutamate receptors are promising drug targets for the treatment of urgent suicide ideation and chronic major depressive disorder (MDD) that may lead to suicide completion. Antagonists of glutamatergic NMDA receptors reduce depressive symptoms faster than traditional antidepressants, with beneficial effects occurring within hours. Glutamate is the prominent excitatory input to the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC). The LC is activated by stress in part through this glutamatergic input. Evidence has accrued demonstrating that the LC may be over-active in MDD, while treatment with traditional antidepressants reduces LC activity. Pathological alterations of both glutamatergic and noradrenergic systems have been observed in depressive disorders, raising the prospect that disrupted glutamate-norepinephrine interactions may be a central component to depression and suicide pathobiology. This study examined the gene expression levels of glutamate receptors in post-mortem noradrenergic LC neurons from subjects with MDD (most died by suicide) and matched psychiatrically normal controls. Gene expression levels of glutamate receptors or receptor subunits were measured in LC neurons collected by laser capture microdissection. MDD subjects exhibited significantly higher expression levels of the NMDA receptor subunit genes, GRIN2B and GRIN2C, and the metabotropic receptor genes, GRM4 and GRM5, in LC neurons. Gene expression levels of these receptors in pyramidal neurons from prefrontal cortex (BA10) did not reveal abnormalities in MDD. These findings implicate disrupted glutamatergic-noradrenergic interactions at the level of the stress-sensitive LC in MDD and suicide, and provide a theoretical mechanism by which glutamate antagonists may exert rapid antidepressant effects.

The EFRP method allows one to synchronize eye tracking with electroencephalographic (EEG) recording to precisely capture users' neural activity at the exact time at which they start to cognitively process a stimulus (e.g., event on the screen). This complements and overcomes some of the shortcomings of the traditional event related potential (ERP) method, which can only stamp the time at which a stimulus is presented to a user. Thus, we propose a method conjecture of the superiority of EFRP over ERP for capturing the cognitive processing of a stimulus when such cognitive processing is not necessarily synchronized with the time at which the stimulus appears. We illustrate the EFRP method with an experiment in a natural IS use context in which we asked users to read an industry report while email pop-up notifications arrived on their screen. The results support our proposed hypotheses and show three distinct neural processes associated with 1) the attentional reaction to email pop-up notification, 2) the cognitive processing of the email pop-up notification, and 3) the motor planning activity involved in opening or not the email. Furthermore, further analyses of the data gathered in the experiment serve to validate our method conjecture about the superiority of the EFRP method over the ERP in natural IS use contexts. In addition to the experiment, our study discusses important IS research questions that could be pursued with the aid of EFRP, and describes a set of guidelines to help IS researchers use this method.

Illustrating the Holistic Effects of Neuroscience and Self-Reported Data in the Context of Technostress Research	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						NeuroIS; Technostress; Correlation; Neuroscience; Self-reports; Triangulation	SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS RESEARCH; CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY; PERCEIVED STRESS; RESEARCH AGENDA; PERFORMANCE; CORTISOL; STRAIN; VALIDATION; RESPONSES	Recent research has made a strong case for the importance of NeuroIS methods for IS research. It has suggested that NeuroIS contributes to an improved explanation and prediction of IS phenomena. Yet, such research is unclear on the source of this improvement; while some studies indicate that NeuroIS constitutes an alternative to psychometrics, implying that the two methods assess the same dimension of an underlying IS construct, other studies indicate that NeuroIS constitutes a complement to psychometrics, implying that the two methods assess different dimensions of an IS construct. To clarify the role of NeuroIS in IS research and its contribution to IS research, in this study, we examine whether NeuroIS and psychometrics/psychological methods constitute alternatives or complements. We conduct this examination in the context of technostress, an emerging IS phenomenon to which both methods are relevant. We use the triangulation approach to explore the relationship between physiological and psychological/self-reported data. Using this approach, we argue that both kinds of data tap into different aspects of technostress and that, together, they can yield a more complete or holistic understanding of the impact of technostress on a theoretically-related outcome, rendering them complements. Then, we test this proposition empirically by probing the correlation between a psychological and a physiological measure of technostress in combination with an examination of their incremental validity in explaining performance on a computer-based task. The results show that the physiological stress measure (salivary alpha-amylase) explains and predicts variance in performance on the computer-based task over and above the prediction afforded by the self-reported stress measure. We conclude that NeuroIS is a critical complement to IS research.

Phase 1 dose-escalation study of IV ixazomib, an investigational proteasome inhibitor, in patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma	BLOOD CANCER JOURNAL			English	Article							RELAPSED MULTIPLE-MYELOMA; NON-HODGKINS-LYMPHOMA; MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA; FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA; B-CELL; BORTEZOMIB RETREATMENT; SUBTYPES; MLN9708; CANCER; MODELS	Ixazomib is an investigational proteasome inhibitor that has shown preclinical activity in lymphoma models. This phase 1 study assessed the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary activity of intravenous (IV) ixazomib in relapsed/refractory lymphoma patients who had received >= 2 prior therapies. Thirty patients with a range of histologies received ixazomib 0.125-3.11 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8 and 15 of 28-day cycles. Patients received a median of two cycles (range 1 - 36). MTD was determined to be 2.34 mg/m(2). Most common drug-related adverse events (AEs) included fatigue (43%), diarrhea (33%), nausea, vomiting and thrombocytopenia (each 27%). Drug-related grade >= 3 AEs included neutropenia (20%), thrombocytopenia (13%) and diarrhea (10%). Drug-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in four (13%) patients; no grade >= 3 events were reported. Plasma exposure increased dose proportionally from 0.5-3.11 mg/m(2); terminal half-life was 4 - 12 days after multiple dosing. Of 26 evaluable patients, five achieved responses: 4/11 follicular lymphoma patients (one complete and three partial responses) and 1/4 peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients (partial response). Sustained responses were observed with >= 32 cycles of treatment in two heavily pretreated follicular lymphoma patients. Results suggest weekly IV ixazomib is generally well tolerated and may be clinically active in relapsed/refractory lymphoma.	[Assouline, S.

The mechanisms of several neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, have been linked to NTs. Because the number of diagnosed cases is increasing, the diagnosis and treatment of such diseases are important. To detect biomolecules including NTs, microtechnology, micro and nanoelectronics have become popular in the form of the miniaturization of medical and clinical devices. They offer high-performance features in terms of sensitivity, as well as low-background noise. In this paper, we review various devices and circuit techniques used for monitoring NTs in vitro and in vivo and compare various methods described in recent publications.

HFOs usually co-occur with interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), and are specific and accurate markers for the epileptic focus, but the brain regions involved when HFOs are generated are unknown. We investigated this question with combined EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), measuring the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, and examined HFOs in the gamma (40-80Hz) and ripple (80-200Hz) bands. MethodsTwenty-eight consecutive patients with focal epilepsy who underwent HFO and EEG-fMRI studies were selected; six were excluded because of negative EEG-fMRI. The remaining 22 patients were divided into two equal groups (11 patients each) based on the frequency of co-occurrence of gamma or ripples with IEDs: low versus high gamma (LG/HG) and low versus high ripples (LR/HR). ResultsNo significant changes were found in the BOLD characteristics between the LG and HG groups. As a group, HR had a larger IED concordant BOLD cluster than the LR group, despite similar IED rates. In addition, the HR group had significantly more thalamic BOLD changes than the LR group (11/11 vs. 2/11). In HR, 5 of 11 patients had thalamic activation only, 4 of 11 had thalamic deactivation only, and 2 of 11 had activation and deactivation in different thalamic regions. In the LR group, 2 of 11 had thalamic activation. The lateralization of thalamic BOLD responses was concordant with the lateralization of cortical ripples in 12 of 13 patients. SignificanceScalp IEDs, when frequently accompanied by HFOs in the ripple but not in the gamma band, are associated with larger cortical metabolic responses and with thalamic involvement lateralized to the side of cortical ripples. We propose that a high rate of epileptic ripples is associated with a more active pathologic cortical-thalamocortical network.

Glutamatergic activity appears to be increased in the early phases of schizophrenia and may contribute to these structural alterations through an excitotoxic effect. The primary aim of this review was to describe the possible role of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in explaining the presence of neuroanatomical changes within schizophrenia. A Medline (R) literature search was conducted, identifying English language studies on the topic of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in schizophrenia, using the terms "schizophreni*" and "glutam*" and (("MRS" or "MRI" or "magnetic resonance") or ("computed tomography" or "CT")). Studies concomitantly investigating glutamatergic activity and brain structure in patients with schizophrenia were included. Results are discussed in the context of findings from preclinical studies. Seven studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. These studies provide inconclusive support for the role of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in the occurrence of structural changes within schizophrenia, with the caveat that there is a paucity of human studies investigating this topic. Preclinical data suggest that an excitotoxic effect may occur as a result of a paradoxical increase in glutamatergic activity following N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor hypofunction. Based on animal Literature, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity may account for certain structural changes present in schizophrenia, but additional human studies are required to substantiate these findings. Future studies should adopt a longitudinal design and employ magnetic resonance imaging techniques to investigate whether an association between glutamatergic activity and structural changes exists in patients with schizophrenia.

Psychomotor retardation is a scar of past depressive episodes, revealed by simple cognitive tests	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; Major depressive disorder; Recurrence; Psychomotor retardation; Scar; Neurotoxic	FRONTAL-LOBE DYSFUNCTION; PROSPECTIVE FOLLOW-UP; MAJOR DEPRESSION; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION; RECURRENT DEPRESSION; PSYCHIATRIC-PATIENTS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION; PARTIAL REMISSION; EUTHYMIC PHASE	The cumulative duration of depressive episodes, and their repetition, has a detrimental effect on depression recurrence rates and the chances of antidepressant response, and even increases the risk of dementia, raising the possibility that depressive episodes could be neurotoxic. Psychomotor retardation could constitute a marker of this negative burden of past depressive episodes, with conflicting findings according to the use of clinical versus cognitive assessments. We assessed the role of the Retardation Depressive Scale (filled in by the clinician) and the time required to perform the neurocognitive d2 attention test and the Trail Making Test (performed by patients) in a sample of 2048 depressed outpatients, before and after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment with agomelatine. From this sample, 1140 patients performed the TMT-A and -B, and 508 performed the d2 test, at baseline and after treatment. At baseline, we found that with more past depressive episodes patients had more severe clinical level of psychomotor retardation, and that they needed more time to perform both d2 and TMT. When the analyses were performed again after treatment, and especially when the analyses were restricted to patients with clinical remission, the cognitive tests were the only ones correlated with past depressive episodes. Psychomotor retardation tested at a cognitive level was therefore systematically revealing the burden of past depressive episodes, with an increased weight for patients with less remaining symptoms. If prospectively confirmed, interventions such as cognitive remediation therapy could benefit from a more specific focus on neurocognitive retardation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

While low S100B levels are neuroprotective, micromolar S100B levels have shown in vitro to activate microglia and facilitate neuronal death. In astrocytes, S100B exposure activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) and induces pro-inflammatory mediators. On microglia and neurons S100B effects are essentially mediated by receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)/NF-B, but it is not clear if these intracellular cascades are activated by different S100B levels in astrocytes and whether increased extracellular S100B is sufficient to induce reactive gliosis. A better understanding of these pathways is essential for developing successful strategies to preserve the beneficial S100B effects after brain injury. Here, we show that microglia-depleted cultured astrocytes exposed to S100B mimicked several features of reactive gliosis by activating RAGE/Rac-1-Cdc42, RAGE/Erk-Akt or RAGE/NF-B-dependent pathways. S100B effects include RAGE/Rac1-Cdc42-dependent astroglial hypertrophy and facilitation of migration as well as increased mitosis. S100B exposure improved the astrocytic survival to oxidative stress, an effect that requires Erk/Akt. S100B also activates NF-B in a dose-dependent manner; increases RAGE proximal promoter transcriptional activity and augmented endogenous RAGE expression. S100B-exposed astrocytes showed a pro-inflammatory phenotype with expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1), and facilitated neuronal death induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation. In vivo, intracerebral infusion of S100B was enough to induce an astroglial reactive phenotype. Together, these findings demonstrate that extracellular S100B in the micromolar level activates different RAGE-dependent pathways that turn astrocytes into a pro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative phenotype. We propose that S100B turns astrocytes into a reactive phenotype in a RAGE-dependent manner but engaging different intracellular pathways. While both nanomolar and micromolar S100B turn astrocytes into a reactive phenotype, micromolar S100B induces a conversion into a pro-inflammatory-neurodegenerative profile that facilitates neuronal death of OGD-exposed neurons. We think that S100B/RAGE interaction is essential to expand reactive gliosis in the injured brain being a tempting target for limiting reactive gliosis to prevent the glial conversion into the neurodegenerative profile.

Adverse early-life experiences, such as stress exposure or suboptimal maternal care, can have long-lasting detrimental consequences for an individual. This phenomenon is often referred to as 'early-life programming' and is associated with an increased risk of disease. Typically, rodents exposed to prenatal stress or postnatal maternal deprivation display enhanced neuroendocrine responses to stress, increased levels of anxiety and depressive-like behaviours, and cognitive impairments. Some of the phenotypes observed in these models of early-life adversity are likely to share common neurobiological mechanisms. For example, there is evidence for impaired glucocorticoid negative-feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, altered glutamate neurotransmission and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis in both prenatally stressed rats and rats that experienced deficient maternal care. The possible mechanisms through which maternal stress during pregnancy may be transmitted to the offspring are reviewed, with special consideration given to altered maternal behaviour postpartum. We also discuss what is known about the neurobiological and epigenetic mechanisms that underpin early-life programming of the neonatal brain in the first generation and subsequent generations, with a view to abrogating programming effects and potentially identifying new therapeutic targets for the treatment of stress-related disorders and cognitive impairment.

Interest in using IS in regenerative medicine has been increasing this past decade. IS are administered in vivo using minimally invasive surgery, which reduces hospitalization time and risk of surgical wound infection. Here, chitosan is explored as an excellent candidate for developing IS. A literature search reveals that 27% of IS publications in the past decade investigated injectable chitosan scaffolds (ICS). This increasing interest in chitosan stems from its many desirable physicochemical properties. The first section of this Progress Report is a comprehensive study of all physical, chemical, and biological stimuli that have been explored to induce ICS gelation in vivo. Second, the use of ICS is investigated in four major regenerative medicine applications, namely bone, cartilage, cardiovascular, and neural regeneration. Finally, an overall critique of the ICS literature in light of clinical translatability is presented. Even though ICS have been widely explored in the literature, very few have progressed to clinical trials. The authors discuss the current barriers to moving ICS into the clinic and provide suggestions regarding what is needed to overcome those challenges.

Different interventions such as aerobic, strength, and gross motor training programs have resulted in improvements in cognitive functions. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between physical activity and cognition are still poorly understood. Recently, it was shown that acute bouts of exercise resulted in reduced executive control at higher relative exercise intensities. Considering that aging is characterized by a reduction in potential energy ((VO2)-O-center dot max-energy cost of walking), which leads to higher relative walking intensity for the same absolute speed, it could be argued that any intervention aimed at reducing the relative intensity of the locomotive task would improve executive control while walking. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of a short-term (8 weeks) high-intensity strength and aerobic training program on executive functions (single and dual task) in a cohort of healthy older adults. Fifty-one participants were included and 47 (age, 70.7 +/- 5.6) completed the study which compared the effects of three interventions: lower body strength + aerobic training (LBS-A), upper body strength + aerobic training (UBS-A), and gross motor activities (GMA). Training sessions were held 3 times every week. Both physical fitness (aerobic, neuromuscular, and body composition) and cognitive functions (RNG) during a dual task were assessed before and after the intervention. Even though the LBS-A and UBS-A interventions increased potential energy to a higher level (Effect size: LBS-A-moderate, UBS-A-small, GMA-trivial), all groups showed equivalent improvement in cognitive function, with inhibition being more sensitive to the intervention. These findings suggest that different exercise programs targeting physical fitness and/or gross motor skills may lead to equivalent improvement in cognition in healthy older adults. Such results call for further investigation of the multiple physiological pathways by which physical exercise can impact cognition in older adults.

Perceiving and processing these two complex acoustical signals rely on a hierarchical functional network distributed throughout several brain regions within and beyond the auditory cortices. Given their similarities, the neural bases for processing these two complex sounds overlap to a certain degree, but particular brain regions may show selectivity for one or the other acoustic category, which we aimed to identify. We examined 53 subjects (28 of them professional musicians) by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), using a paradigm designed to identify regions showing increased activity in response to different types of musical stimuli, compared to different types of complex sounds, such as speech and non-linguistic vocalizations. We found a region in the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyms (aSTG) (planum polare) that showed preferential activity in response to musical stimuli and was present in all our subjects, regardless of musical training, and invariant across different musical instruments (violin, piano or synthetic piano). Our data show that this cortical region is preferentially involved in processing musical, as compared to other complex sounds, suggesting a functional role as a second-order relay, possibly integrating acoustic characteristics intrinsic to music (e.g., melody extraction). Moreover, we assessed whether musical experience modulates the response of cortical regions involved in music processing and found evidence of functional differences between musicians and non-musicians during music listening. In particular, bilateral activation of the planum polare was more prevalent, but not exclusive, in musicians than non-musicians, and activation of the right posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (planum temporale) differed between groups. Our results provide evidence of functional specialization for music processing in specific regions of the auditory cortex and show domain-specific functional differences possibly correlated with musicianship.

A long Stokes shift red fluorescent Ca2+ indicator protein for two-photon and ratiometric imaging	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ASTROCYTES IN-SITU; TRANSGENE EXPRESSION; ENDOGENOUS GLUTAMATE; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CALCIUM; ADENOSINE; RECEPTOR; CELLS; SPECTROSCOPY; MECHANISM	The introduction of calcium ion (Ca2+) indicators based on red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) has created new opportunities for multicolour visualization of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. However, one drawback of these indicators is that they have optimal two-photon excitation outside the near-infrared window (650-1,000 nm) where tissue is most transparent to light. To address this shortcoming, we developed a long Stokes shift RFP-based Ca2+ indicator, REX-GECO1, with optimal two-photon excitation at < 1,000 nm. REX-GECO1 fluoresces at 585 nm when excited at 480nm or 910 nm by a one- or two-photon process, respectively. We demonstrate that REX-GECO1 can be used as either a ratiometric or intensiometric Ca2+ indicator in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (one-and two-photon) and the visual system of albino tadpoles (two-photon). Furthermore, we demonstrate single excitation wavelength two-colour Ca2+ and glutamate imaging in organotypic cultures.

We investigated how this vicarious facilitation effect is modulated by directing the observer's attention toward the meaning of pain expression or the facial movements. In separate trials, participants were instructed to assess the "intensity of the pain expression"(meaning) or to "discriminate the facial movements" in the upper vs lower part of the face shown in 1-second dynamic clips displaying mild, moderate, or strong pain expressions or a neutral control. In 50% of the trials, participants received a painful electrical stimulation to the sural nerve immediately after the presentation of the expression. Low-level nociceptive reactivity was measured with the RIII-response, and pain perception was assessed using pain ratings. Pain induced by the electrical stimulation increased after viewing stronger pain expressions in both tasks, but the RIII-response showed this vicarious facilitation effect only in the movement discrimination task at the strongest expression intensity. These findings are consistent with the notion that vicarious processes facilitate self-pain and may prime automatic nociceptive responses. However, this priming effect is influenced by top-down attentional processes. These results provide another case of dissociation between reflexive and perceptual processes, consistent with the involvement of partly separate brain networks in the regulation of cortical and lower-level nociceptive responses. Combined with previous results, these findings suggest that vicarious pain facilitation is an automatic process that may be diminished by top-down attentional processes directed at the meaning of the expression.

Broad-spectrum analgesic efficacy of IBNtxA is mediated by exon 11-associated splice variants of the mu-opioid receptor gene	PAIN			English	Article						mu-Opioid; Chronic pain; Synergy; Transgenic; Splice variants; mRNA expression	SPARED NERVE INJURY; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; MORPHINE; MOUSE; MODEL; RAT; CHALLENGES; SYMPTOMS; LACKING	mu-Opioids remain vastly important for the treatment of pain, and would represent ideal analgesics if their analgesic effects could be separated from their many side effects. A recently synthesized compound, iodobenzoylnaltrexamide (IBNtxA), acting at 6-transmembrane (6-TM) splice variants of the mu-opioid receptor gene, was shown to have potent analgesic actions against acute, thermal pain accompanied by a vastly improved side-effect profile compared to 7-TM-acting drugs such as morphine. Whether such analgesia can be seen in longer-lasting and nonthermal algesiometric assays is not known. The current study demonstrates potent and efficacious IBNtxA inhibition of a wide variety of assays, including inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain. We further demonstrate the dependence of such analgesia on 6-TM mu-opioid receptor variants using isobolographic analysis and the testing of Oprm1 (the mu-opioid receptor gene) exon 11 null mutant mice. Finally, the effect of nerve damage (spared nerve injury) and inflammatory injury (complete Freund's adjuvant) on expression of mu-opioid receptor variant genes in pain-relevant central nervous system loci was examined, revealing a downregulation of the mMOR-1D splice variant in the dorsal root ganglion after spared nerve injury. These findings are supportive of the potential value of 6-TM-acting drugs as novel analgesics. (C) 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In 16 dogs, peak vertical force (PVF), subjective pain assessment using 3 scales, sympathetic stress response with electrodermal activity (EDA) measurement, and behavioural changes with video analysis and telemetered motor activity were quantified at baseline (D-7), and 28 and 56 days post transection of the cranial cruciate ligament. As markers of central sensitisation, selected spinal cord biomarkers (substance P and transthyretin) were quantified at D56. Electrical withdrawal thresholds on the stifle and the tail were measured as indicative of peripheral and central quantitative sensory testing (QST) sensitisation, respectively. The effects of vehicle administration (n = 8) were compared with tiludronate (2 mg/kg subcutaneously, q2week, starting at D0) administration. Generalized estimated equations tested the association between the behavioural and physiological methods and QST sensitisation, and therefore the sensitivity of the methods for detecting treatment efficacy. Compared to tiludronate, at D56, vehicle-treated dogs had increased spinal substance P (P = 0.01), concomitant decreased transthyretin (P = 0.02), and (compared to baseline) demonstrated peripheral and central QST sensitisation, which was not present for tiludronate. Only PVF, the spontaneous behaviour "walking with full weight-bearing,'' and EDA were associated with occurrence of QST sensitisation and indicated significant tiludronate analgesic efficacy after inclusion of central QST sensitisation as a predictor variable in the statistical model. This study establishes the strong interest to implement QST as a predictor of canine osteoarthritis pain symptoms explained by pain sensitisation.

We investigated possible neuroanatomical underpinnings of the beneficial effects of yoga using sensory testing and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. North American yogis tolerated pain more than twice as long as individually matched controls and had more gray matter (GM) in multiple brain regions. Across subjects, insular GM uniquely correlated with pain tolerance. Insular GM volume in yogis positively correlated with yoga experience, suggesting a causal relationship between yoga and insular size. Yogis also had increased left intrainsular white matter integrity, consistent with a strengthened insular integration of nociceptive input and parasympathetic autonomic regulation. Yogis, as opposed to controls, used cognitive strategies involving parasympathetic activation and interoceptive awareness to tolerate pain, which could have led to use-dependent hypertrophy of insular cortex. Together, these findings suggest that regular and long-term yoga practice improves pain tolerance in typical North Americans by teaching different ways to deal with sensory inputs and the potential emotional reactions attached to those inputs leading to a change in insular brain anatomy and connectivity.

Different models have been used to forecast energy demand in buildings, including whole building energy simulation, regression analysis, and black-box models (e.g., artificial neural networks). This paper presents a different approach to predict the energy demand of commercial buildings using case-based reasoning (CBR). The proposed approach is evaluated using monitored data in a real office building located in Varennes, Quebec. The energy demand is predicted at every hour for the following 3 h using weather forecasts. The results show that during occupancy, 7:00-18:00, the coefficient of variance of the rootmean-square-error (CV-RMSE) is below 13.2%, the normalized mean bias error (NMBE) is below 5.8% and the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) is below 14 kW. When the statistical criteria are calculated for all hours of the day, the CV-RMSE is 12.1%, the NMBE is 1.0% and the RMSE is 11 kW. The case study demonstrates that CBR can be used for energy demand prediction and could be implemented in building operation systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent studies indicate that a mere 1% improvement in the efficiency of such systems generates millions of dollars in savings at the national level. This efficiency can be optimized when better control strategies are implemented. A first step in the control and optimization process is to establish a model that describes the system's behavior. In this study, artificial neural networks were selected for modeling a particular type of heat pump called direct expansion geothermal heat pump because the ground heat exchanger is a component of the heat pump, and thus directly plays the role of condenser or evaporator according to the operation mode. The data collection methodology and the algorithms used for training are presented. Of the four algorithms tested in this study with variable numbers of neurons in the hidden layers, the model obtained using the Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm with 28 neurons in the hidden layer appears to be the best, with an average coefficient of multiple determinations of about 0.9991, an average RMS of 0.16330, and an average COV of 2.9319.

Greater variability in cognitive task performance has been shown to be an important predictor of neurologic status and provides a unique measure of cognitive performance in MS patients. Objectives: This study investigated alterations in resting-state functional connectivity associated with within-person performance variability in MS patients. Methods: Relapsing remitting MS patients and matched healthy controls completed structural MRI and resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) scans, as well as tests of information processing speed. Performance variability was calculated from reaction time tests of processing speed. rsfMRI connectivity was investigated within regions associated with the default mode network (DMN). Relations between performance variability and functional connectivity in the DMN within MS patients were evaluated. Results: MS patients demonstrated greater reaction time performance variability compared to healthy controls (p<0.05). For MS patients, more stable performance on a complex processing speed task was associated with greater resting-state connectivity between the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the frontal pole. Conclusions: Among MS patients, greater functional connectivity between medial prefrontal and frontal pole regions appears to facilitate performance stability on complex speed-dependent information processing tasks.

Methods: Information about relapses was collected using MSBase, an international observational registry. Associations between relapse phenotypes and history of similar relapses or patient characteristics were tested with multivariable logistic regression models. Tendency of relapse phenotypes to recur sequentially was assessed with principal component analysis. Results: Among 14,969 eligible patients (89,949 patient-years), 49,279 phenotypically characterised relapses were recorded. Visual and brainstem relapses occurred more frequently in early disease and in younger patients. Sensory relapses were more frequent in early or non-progressive disease. Pyramidal, sphincter and cerebellar relapses were more common in older patients and in progressive disease. Women presented more often with sensory or visual symptoms. Men were more prone to pyramidal, brainstem and cerebellar relapses. Importantly, relapse phenotype was predicted by the phenotypes of previous relapses. (OR = 1.8-5, p = 10(-14)). Sensory, visual and brainstem relapses showed better recovery than other relapse phenotypes. Relapse severity increased and the ability to recover decreased with age or more advanced disease. Conclusion: Relapse phenotype was associated with demographic and clinical characteristics, with phenotypic recurrence significantly more common than expected by chance.

In rats, increasing the speed of intravenous cocaine delivery (5 vs. 90 s) increases drug intake and the subsequent motivation to self-administer cocaine. Increased motivation for cocaine could result not only from more extensive prior drug intake and operant responding for drug, but also from neuroplasticity evoked by rapid drug uptake. We determined the contributions of prior drug intake and operant responding to the increased motivation for cocaine evoked by rapid delivery. We also investigated the effects of cocaine delivery speed on corticostriatal expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) mRNA. Rats self-administered cocaine (0.25 mg/kg/infusion) delivered over 5 or 90 s during short-access (1 h/session; ShA) or long-access (6 h; LgA) sessions. Motivation for cocaine was then assessed by measuring responding under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Next, BDNF and TrkB mRNA levels were measured in 5- and 90-s rats. Five-second ShA and 5-s-LgA rats were more motivated for cocaine than their 90-s counterparts. This effect was dissociable from previous levels of drug intake or of operant responding for cocaine. In parallel, only rats self-administering rapid cocaine injections had altered BDNF and TrkB mRNA levels in corticostriatal regions. Rapid drug delivery augments the motivation for cocaine independently of effects on the levels of drug intake or operant responding for drug. We suggest that rapid delivery might increase the motivation for drug by promoting neuroplasticity within reward pathways. This neuroplasticity could involve increased regulation of BDNF/TrkB.

The mammalian Pax family of transcription factors is characterized by a similar to 128-amino-acid DNA-binding paired domain that makes sequence-specific contacts with DNA. The diversity in Pax gene activities emerges from complex modes of interaction with enhancer regions and heterodimerization with multiple interaction partners. Based on in vitro optimal binding-site selection studies and enhancer identification assays, it has been suggested that Pax proteins may recognize and bind their target DNA elements with different binding modes/topologies, however this hypothesis has not yet been structurally explored. One of the most extensively studied DNA target elements of the Pax6 paired domain is the eye-lens specific DC5 (delta-crystallin) enhancer element. In order to shed light on Pax6-DC5 DNA interactions, the related paired-domain prototype Pax9 was crystallized with the minimal delta-crystallin DC5 enhancer element and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis was attempted. A 3.0 angstrom resolution native data set was collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven from crystals grown in a solution consisting of 10%(w/v) PEG 20K, 20%(v/v) PEG 550 MME, 0.03 M NaNO3, 0.03 M Na2HPO4, 0.03 M NH2SO4, 0.1 M MES/imidazole pH 6.5. The data set was indexed and merged in space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a=75.74, b=165.59, c=70.14 angstrom, alpha=beta=gamma=90 degrees. The solvent content in the unit cell is consistent with the presence of one Pax9 paired domain bound to duplex DNA in the asymmetric unit.

The aim of this study was to investigate their effectiveness in patients >= 40 years with severe neurally mediated syncope (NMS) enroled in the Third International Study on Syncope of Uncertain Etiology (ISSUE-3). Methods and results In the ISSUE-3 study, 63 out of 162 patients had a diagnosis of hypotensive NMS (Types 2, 3, and 4A) documented by implantable loop recorder; of these, 40 were instructed to perform isometric leg and arm PCM therapy. Their mean age was 62+ 13 years; 47% of patients had a history of some episodes without prodrome. A group of 45 untreated patients acted as controls. The primary endpoint was the time to first syncope recurrence. During follow-up, syncope recurred in 15 PCM patients (37%) and in 24 control patients (53%) (P = 0.14). At 21 months, the modelled syncope recurrence rates were 42% [95% confidence interval (CI): 27-61] and 64% (95% CI: 48-80), respectively (P = 0.27). Conclusion In conclusion, many ISSUE-3 patients affected by hypotensive NMS have syncopal recurrence despite PCM. Older age and the absence of sufficiently long recognizable prodromal symptoms in the ISSUE-3 population might have hampered the effectiveness of PC therapy.

Community adults completed measures of 2 higher order dimensions of perfectionism (personal standards [PS], self-criticism [SC]), neuroticism, and conscientiousness. Then, 6 months later and again 3 years later, participants completed daily questionnaires of stress, coping, and affect for 14 consecutive days. PS was associated with aggregated daily problem-focused coping and positive reinterpretation, whereas SC was uniquely associated with daily negative social interactions, avoidant coping, negative affect, and sadness at Month 6 and Year 3. Multilevel modeling results demonstrated that both individuals with higher PS and those with higher SC were emotionally reactive to event stress, negative social interactions, and avoidant coping at Month 6 and Year 3 and to less perceived control at Year 3. Positive reinterpretation was especially effective for individuals with higher SC at Month 6 and Year 3. The effects of PS on daily stress reactivity and coping (in) effectiveness were clearly distinguished from the effects of neuroticism and conscientiousness, whereas the SC effects were due to shared overlap with PS and neuroticism. The present findings demonstrate the promise of using repeated daily diary methodologies to help therapists and clients reliably predict future client reactions to daily stressors, which, in turn, could help guide interventions to break apart dysfunctional patterns connected to distress and build resilience for vulnerable individuals.

Despite significant advancements, current systems are unable to restore complex movements. Decoding reward-related signals from the medial intraparietal area (MIP) could enhance prosthetic performance. However, the dynamics of reward sensitivity in MIP is not known. Furthermore, reward-related modulation in premotor areas has been attributed to behavioral confounds. Here we investigated the stability of reward encoding in MIP by assessing the effect of reward history on reward sensitivity. We recorded from neurons in MIP while monkeys performed a delayed-reach task under two reward schedules. In the variable schedule, an equal number of small- and large-rewards trials were randomly interleaved. In the constant schedule, one reward size was delivered for a block of trials. The memory period firing rate of most neurons in response to identical rewards varied according to schedule. Using systems identification tools, we attributed the schedule sensitivity to the dependence of neural activity on the history of reward. We did not find schedule-dependent behavioral changes, suggesting that reward modulates neural activity in MIP. Neural discrimination between rewards was less in the variable than in the constant schedule, degrading our ability to decode reach target and reward simultaneously. The effect of schedule was mitigated by adding Haar wavelet coefficients to the decoding model. This raises the possibility of multiple encoding schemes at different timescales and reinforces the potential utility of reward information for prosthetic performance.

Panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone versus placebo plus bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind phase 3 trial	LANCET ONCOLOGY			English	Article							INHIBITOR PANOBINOSTAT; COMBINATION THERAPY; TRIPLE COMBINATION; SINGLE-AGENT; LENALIDOMIDE; LBH589; TRANSPLANTATION; VORINOSTAT	Background Panobinostat is a potent oral pan-deacetylase inhibitor that in preclinical studies has synergistic antimyeloma activity when combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone. We aimed to compare panobinostat, bortezomib, and dexamethasone with placebo, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Methods PANORAMA1 is a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 3 trial of patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received between one and three previous treatment regimens. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web-based and voice response system, stratified by number of previous treatment lines and by previous use of bortezomib, to receive 21 day cycles of placebo or panobinostat (20 mg; on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, orally), both in combination with bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, 11, intravenously) and dexamethasone (20 mg on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, orally). Patients, physicians, and the investigators who did the data analysis were masked to treatment allocation; crossover was not permitted. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (in accordance with modified European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria and based on investigators' assessment) and was analysed by intention to treat. The study is ongoing, but no longer recruiting, and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01023308. Findings 768 patients were enrolled between Jan 21, 2010, and Feb 29, 2012, with 387 randomly assigned to panobinostat, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and 381 to placebo, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. Median follow-up was 6.47 months (IQR 1.81-13.47) in the panobinostat group and 5.59 months (2.14-11.30) in the placebo group. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the panobinostat group than in the placebo group (11.99 months [95% CI 10.33-12.94] vs 8.08 months [7.56-9.23]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.76; p<0.0001). Overall survival data are not yet mature, although at the time of this analysis, median overall survival was 33.64 months (95% CI 31.34-not estimable) for the panobinostat group and 30.39 months (26.87-not estimable) for the placebo group (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69-1.10; p=0.26). The proportion of patients achieving an overall response did not differ between treatment groups (235[60.7%, 95% CI 55.7-65.6] for panobinostat vs 208 [54.6%, 49.4-59.7] for placebo; p=0.09); however, the proportion of patients with a complete or near complete response was significantly higher in the panobinostat group than in the placebo group (107[27.6%, 95% CI 23.2-32.4] vs 60 [15.7%, 12.2-19.8]; p=0.00006). Minimal responses were noted in 23 (6%) patients in the panobinostat group and in 42 (11%) in the placebo group. Median duration of response (partial response or better) was 13.14 months (95% CI 11.76-14.92) in the panobinostat group and 10.87 months (9.23-11.76) in the placebo group, and median time to response (partial response or better) was 1.51 months (1.41-1.64) in the panobinostat group and 2.00 months (1.61-2.79) in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were reported in 228 (60%) of 381 patients in the panobinostat group and 157 (42%) of 377 patients in the placebo group. Common grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities and adverse events (irrespective of association with study drug) included thrombocytopenia (256 [67%] in the panobinostat group vs 118 [31%] in the placebo group), lymphopenia (202 [53%] vs 150 [40%]), diarrhoea (97 [26%] vs 30 [8%]), asthenia or fatigue (91 [24%] vs 45 [12%]), and peripheral neuropathy (67 [18%] vs 55 [15%]). Interpretation Our results suggest that panobinostat could be a useful addition to the treatment armamentarium for patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Longer follow up will be necessary to determine whether there is any effect on overall survival.	[San-Miguel, Jesus F.] Univ Navarra Clin, CIMA, Pamplona 31008, Spain; [Hungria, Vania T.

THAM for Control of ICP	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Review						Tromethamine; THAM; ICP; Intracranial pressure; Systematic review	SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; ANTIEDEMA THERAPY; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; CLINICAL-TRIAL; GRADE; RECOMMENDATIONS; ACIDOSIS; BICARBONATE; GUIDELINES	Our goal was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the use of tromethamine (THAM) and its effects on intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with neurological illness. All articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, HealthStar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to February 2014), reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature were searched. Two reviewers independently identified all manuscripts pertaining to the administration of THAM in human patients that recorded effects on ICP. Secondary outcomes of effect on cerebral perfusion pressure, mean arterial pressure, patient outcome, and adverse effects were recorded. Two reviewers independently extracted data including population characteristics and treatment characteristics. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and GRADE methodology. Our search strategy produced a total 2,268 citations. Twelve articles, 9 manuscripts, and 3 meeting proceedings were considered for the review with all utilizing THAM while documenting ICP in neurosurgical patients. All studies were prospective. Across all studies, there were a total of 488 patients studied, with 263 receiving THAM and 225 serving as controls in a variety of heterogeneous studies. All but one study documented a decrease in ICP with THAM administration, with both bolus and continuous infusions. One study documented a reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure. No significant renal dysfunction, hepatocellular injury, or hypoglycemia were reported. Three prospective randomized control trials displayed trends to improved outcome in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with THAM administration. There currently exists Oxford level 2b, GRADE B evidence to support that THAM reduces ICP in the TBI and malignant ischemic infarct population, with minimal side effects. The literature suggests THAM may be useful for ICP reduction in certain cases, though the safety of the compound in these circumstances is still unclear. Further prospective study is warranted.

A 44-year-old woman with a 7-year history of depression presented with neurological signs and a recent cognitive decline. The diagnosis of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids was suspected based on the findings of a predominant frontal leukoencephalopathy and neuroaxonal spheroids on brain biopsy. She shares with her mother a novel CSF1R exon 18 missense mutation (c.2350G>A; p.V784M). The mother has a long-standing bipolar disorder and mild multifocal white matter abnormalities in her 70s. This is the first report of hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids due to this novel CSF1R missense mutation. Our report suggests that either marked intrafamilial variability or incomplete penetrance can be associated with CSF1R mutations. The observation of a small bone cyst in our patient supports the hypothesis that hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with neuroaxonal spheroids and polycystic lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy may belong to a spectrum of overlapping phenotypes.

During the last decade, the developments in imaging strategies have taken a great leap by the advancements in new imaging scanners, development of pharmaceutical drugs, diagnostic agents, and new therapeutic regimens that made significant improvements in health care. The knowledge gained from imaging techniques in preclinical research can be applicable to the patients. Similarly, the problems from clinical studies with humans can be tested and studied in preclinical studies. The appropriate application of molecular imaging to drug discovery and development can markedly reduce costs and the time required for new drug development. Some imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), reveal anatomical images, and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), SPECT/positron emission tomography (PET), and PET show functional images. These developing molecular or neuroimaging methods provide increasingly detailed structural and functional information about the nervous system. The basic principles of each technique are described followed by examples of the current applications to cutting-edge neuroscience research. In summary, it is shown that neuroimaging continues to grow and evolve, embracing new technologies and advancing to address ever more complex and important neuroscience questions.

Meta-Analysis of the Efficacy and Safety of Bortezomib Re-Treatment in Patients With Multiple Myeloma	CLINICAL LYMPHOMA MYELOMA & LEUKEMIA			English	Article						Meta-regression analysis; Overall response rate; Random-effect model; Refractory; Relapsed	RANDOMIZED PHASE-III; PEGYLATED LIPOSOMAL DOXORUBICIN; PLUS BORTEZOMIB; APEX TRIAL; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; MELPHALAN-PREDNISONE; TREATMENT STRATEGIES; I/II TRIAL; COMBINATION; THERAPY	This meta-analysis of 23 studies of bortezomib-based retreatment in relapsed/refractory myeloma demonstrated a pooled, weighted average response rate of 39.1% and median time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) of 7.5 and 16.6 months, respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) included thrombocytopenia (35%), neutropenia (15%), and anemia (14%). These data demonstrate the efficacy and tolerability of bortezomib retreatment in previously treated patients. Introduction: Bortezomib is administered for a finite course; thus, patients might remain sensitive to bortezomib-based therapy at relapse. We report a meta-analysis of bortezomib-based retreatment in relapsed/refractory myeloma. Patients and Methods: A systematic literature review identified studies of bortezomib-based retreatment in relapsed/refractory myeloma. Proportions of bortezomib-refractory patients and additional prognostic factors were extracted and used in weighted stratified analyses of TTP and OS. Random-effect pooled estimates were calculated for overall response rate (ORR) and rates of common AEs. Results: Twenty-three studies (n = 1051 patients) were identified. Bortezomib was administered intravenously in all studies. Across studies in which data were available, pooled, weighted average ORR was 39.1% (95% confidence interval, 30.8%-47.4%), and pooled, weighted average median TTP and OS were 7.5 and 16.6 months, respectively. Patients with fewer previous therapies (<= 4) and relapsed (not refractory) patients achieved higher ORRs, of 43.4% and 57.2%, respectively. Random-effects meta-regression analysis confirmed that relapsed patients were associated with a higher ORR by 28 to 41 percentage points versus refractory patients. In relapsed patients, median TTP and OS were 8.5 and 19.7 months, respectively. Common Grade 3/4 AEs included thrombocytopenia (35%), neutropenia (15%), anemia (14%), pneumonia (10%), and peripheral neuropathy (3%). Conclusion: Based on these findings, bortezomib retreatment is well tolerated and appears efficacious in relapsed patients. In an era of new and emerging treatment options for relapsed and/or refractory myeloma, these data indicate that bortezomib retreatnnent might be a highly effective option in previously treated patients.

To better understand how fetal brains respond to hypoxia, we examined the effects of low oxygen availability on brain activity in late-stage chick embryos (day 18 out of a 21-day incubation period). Using cFos protein expression as a marker for neuronal activity, we focused on two specific, immunohistochemically identified cell groups known to play an important role in regulating adult brain states (sleep and waking): the noradrenergic neurons of the Locus Coeruleus (NA-LC), and the Hypocretin/Orexin (H/O) neurons of the hypothalamus. cFos expression was also examined in the Pallium (the avian analog of the cerebral cortex). In adult mammalian brains, cFos expression changes in a coordinated way in these areas. In chick embryos, oxygen deprivation simultaneously activated NA-LC while deactivating H/O-producing neurons; it also increased cFos expression in the Pallium. Activity in one pallial primary sensory area was significantly related to NA-LC activity. These data reveal that at least some of the same neural systems involved in brain-state control in adults may play a central role in orchestrating prenatal hypoxic responses, and that these circuits may show different patterns of coordination than seen in adults.

We sought to determine whether age at first inhalation and initial reactions to inhaling nicotine are related to level of physical dependence in early adulthood. Methods: Young adults (n =312; mean age =24 years; 51% female) from the Nicotine Dependence in Teens study who had smoked at least once in the preceding three months completed self-report questionnaires in 2011-12. We assessed level of physical dependence with three validated self-report items assessing 'wanting,' craving' and 'needing' triggered by nicotine deprivation. Survey items assessed smoking behavior, including age at first inhalation, and recalled first reactions to inhaling nicotine. Results: After adjusting for covariates, experiencing relaxation, heart racing/pounding, rush or "buzz" (OR= 1.45; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.94) and dizziness (OR= 1.58; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.18) at first nicotine inhalation were associated with an increased odds of being at a higher level of physical dependence in young adulthood; the association for experiencing relaxation (OR= 1.78; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.64) and heart racing/pounding (OR= 1.51; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.28) persisted after additionally controlling for all other first reactions. Neither age at first inhalation nor unpleasant first reactions predicted level of physical dependence. Conclusions: In accordance with prior research, our findings suggest that smokers who are particularly sensitive to the pleasant, "buzz-related" and generally arousing effects of nicotine may be more likely to attain higher levels of physical dependence.

Synchronous airway lesions in children: An analysis of characteristics and comorbidities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY			English	Article						Synchronous airway lesions; Pediatrics; Rigid bronchoscopy; Neurological anomalies; GERD	GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX; FIBEROPTIC LARYNGOSCOPY; LARYNGOMALACIA; INFANTS; STRIDOR; DIAGNOSIS; DISORDERS; ANOMALIES; STENOSIS	Objectives: To analyze the characteristics and the associated medical co-morbidities in children with synchronous airway lesions (SALs) found during rigid bronchoscopy. Methods: Retrospective case series and chart review of patients who were found to have more than one airway lesion after undergoing airway evaluation via rigid endoscopy at a tertiary care pediatric hospital between 2001 and 2011. Patient demographics, presence of associated non-airway pathologies, and the number and types of airway lesions were collected. For analysis, airway lesions were classified based on the anatomical subsites involved (supraglottic, glottic, subglottic, tracheal and bronchial). Results: Out of 592 rigid bronchoscopies performed, there were 73 cases with SALs (12.3%). Of these, only 20% of patients were term infants without associated congenital anomalies. Over 70% of patients with SALs have combinations of lesions involving the trachea, subglottis and supraglottis. Neurological anomalies and GERD were both independently associated with a three-time increase in the odds of having synchronous involvement of these three anatomical subsites (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.06-9.41; OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.05-8.50, respectively). Glottic lesions were present in 28.7% of patients. Prematurity and cardiac anomalies were both associated with tendency of doubling the odds of glottic lesions (OR 2.34, 95% CI 0.84-6.52; OR 2.0, 95% Cl 0.76-5.60, respectively). Overall, almost 10% of newly diagnosed lesions in context of SALs required an additional intervention. Conclusions: The majority of patients with SALs are either born prematurely or have associated congenital anomalies. In SAL patients with associated neurological anomalies or GERD, the lesions are more likely to be localized to the supraglottis, subglottis and trachea whereas prematurity and cardiac anomalies could both be increasing the odds of a glottic lesion. High suspicious index should be kept in mind when rigid bronchoscopy is performed to not miss an associated lesion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Pilot Evaluation of the Role of Bracing in Stable Thoracolumbar Burst Fractures Without Neurological Deficit	JOURNAL OF SPINAL DISORDERS & TECHNIQUES			English	Article						burst fracture; kyphosis; brace; pain; disability; thoracolumbar; ambulation	NONOPERATIVE TREATMENT; LUMBAR SPINE; MANAGEMENT; RADIOGRAPHS; SCOLIOSIS; KYPHOSIS; ORTHOSIS; TRAUMA	Study Design: Prospective, 2-center, observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Objective: Investigate clinical and radiologic outcomes of bracing versus no-bracing in the treatment of stable thoracolumbar burst fractures. Summary of Background Data: Management of thoracolumbar burst fractures depends upon clinical presentation of neurological deficit and radiographic features of fracture severity. Neurologically intact patients with mild deformity and biomechanical stability may be treated with conservative therapy. Methods: Patients with stable (AO type A3), single level, thoracolumbar burst fractures between T12 and L2 with no neurological deficit were randomized to nonoperative treatment with a customized thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) or no-brace. Self-reported clinical outcomes of pain, disability, and health-related quality of life, and radiographic outcomes of kyphotic progression and loss of vertebral height, assessed by 2 independent reviewers blinded to treatment group, were measured at 6 months follow-up. Results: Twenty-three consecutive eligible patients were included (TLSO: n = 12; no-brace: n = 11). There were no between-group differences regarding level of injury (P = 0.75) and baseline spine geometry including fractional canal compromise (P = 0.49), anterior loss of vertebral body height (P = 0.28), and sagittal Cobb angle (P = 0.13). In-hospital stay was significantly shorter in the no-brace group (mean: 2.8 +/- 3.0d) compared with the TLSO group (mean: 6.3 +/- 2.1d; P = 0.004). At follow-up there were no differences in anterior loss of vertebral body height (TLSO: 12.5% +/- 10.2% vs. no-brace: 11.9% +/- 8.1%; P = 0.88), kyphotic progression (TLSO: 5.3 +/- 4.4 degrees vs. no-brace 5.2 +/- 3.6 degrees; P = 0.93), adverse events, or self-reported clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Neurologically intact patients with stable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated with or without bracing had similar radiographic and clinical outcomes at 6 months followup. The no-brace group had shorter in-hospital lengths of stay. Conservative therapy involving early mobilization without brace immobilization may be warranted. Further studies with a larger series of patients and longer follow-up are required for conclusive findings.

Methods and results: We performed a retrospective multicenter analysis of all patients with arch aneurysms treated with a new branched endograft designed with 2 inner branches to perfuse the supra aortic trunks. Thirty-eight patients were included. The median age was 71 years (range, 64-74 years). An American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or 4 was reported in 89.5%(95% confidence interval [CI], 79.7-99.3) of patients. The 30-day mortality rate was 13.2%(95% CI, 2.2-24.2). Technical success was obtained in 32 patients (84.2% [95% CI, 72.4-95.9]). Early secondary procedures were performed in 4 patients (10.5% [95% CI, 0.7-20.3]). Early cerebrovascular complications were diagnosed in 6 patients (15.8% [95% CI, 4.0-27.6]), including 4 transient ischemic attacks, 1 stroke, and 1 subarachnoid hemorrhage. The median follow-up was 12 months (range, 6-12 months). During follow-up, no aneurysm-related death was detected. Secondary procedures during follow-up were performed in 3 patients (9.1% [95% CI, 0.0-19.1]), including 1 conversion to open surgery. We compared the first 10 patients (early experience group) with the subsequent 28 patients. Intraoperative complications and secondary procedures were significantly higher in the early experience group. Although not statistically significant, the early mortality was higher in the early experience group (30% [95% CI, 0.0-60.0]) versus the remainder (7.1% [95% CI, 0.0-16.9]; P = .066). Being part of the early experience group and ascending aortic diameter >= 38 mm were found to be associated to higher rates of combined early mortality and neurologic complications. Conclusions: Our preliminary study confirms the feasibility and safety of the endovascular repair of arch aneurysms in selected patients who may not have other conventional options.

Regulation of astrocyte activation by glycolipids drives chronic CNS inflammation	NATURE MEDICINE			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; REACTIVE ASTROCYTES; LACTOSYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASE; T-CELLS; DISEASE; MICE; EXPRESSION; MONOCYTES	Astrocytes have complex roles in health and disease, thus it is important to study the pathways that regulate their function. Here we report that lactosylceramide (LacCer) synthesized by beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6 (B4GALT6) is upregulated in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice during chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). LacCer acts in an autocrine manner to control astrocyte transcriptional programs that promote neurodegeneration. In addition, LacCer in astrocytes controls the recruitment and activation of microglia and CNS-infiltrating monocytes in a non cell autonomous manner by regulating production of the chemokine CCL2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), respectively. We also detected high B4GALT6 gene expression and LacCer concentrations in CNS MS lesions. Inhibition of LacCer synthesis in mice suppressed local CNS innate immunity and neurodegeneration in EAE and interfered with the activation of human astrocytes in vitro. Thus, B4GALT6 regulates astrocyte activation and is a potential therapeutic target for MS and other neuroinflammatory disorders.

Here we show that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coagulation factor 11 receptor-like 1 (F2rl1, previously known as Par2) is abundant in retinal ganglion cells and is associated with new blood vessel formation during retinal development and in ischemic retinopathy. After stimulation, F2rl1 in retinal ganglion cells translocates from the plasma membrane to the cell nucleus using a microtubule-dependent shuttle that requires sorting nexin 11 (Snx11). At the nucleus, F2rl1 facilitates recruitment of the transcription factor Sp1 to trigger Vegfa expression and, in turn, neovascularization. In contrast, classical plasma membrane activation of F2rl1 leads to the expression of distinct genes, including Ang1, that are involved in vessel maturation. Mutant versions of F2rl1 that prevent nuclear relocalization but not plasma membrane activation interfere with Vegfa but not Ang1 expression. Complementary angiogenic factors are therefore regulated by the subcellular localization of a receptor (F2rl1) that governs angiogenesis. These findings may have implications for the selectivity of drug actions based on the subcellular distribution of their targets.

These respiratory events lead to chronic sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxemia. Several studies have shown that OSA is associated with daytime sleepiness and cognitive dysfunctions, characterized by impairments of attention, episodic memory, working memory, and executive functions. This paper reviews the cognitive profile of adults with OSA and discusses the relative role of altered sleep and hypoxemia in the aetiology of these cognitive deficits. Markers of cognitive dysfunctions such as those measured with waking electroencephalography and neuroimaging are also presented. The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cognitive functioning and the possibility of permanent brain damage associated with OSA are also discussed. Finally, this paper reviews the evidence suggesting that OSA is a risk factor for developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia in the aging population and stresses the importance of its early diagnosis and treatment.

Sleep and wake disturbances following traumatic brain injury	PATHOLOGIE BIOLOGIE			English	Review						Traumatic brain injury; Sleep; Sleep-wake disturbances; Insomnia; Hypersomnia; Circadian rhythms	EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHM; HEAD-INJURY; DISORDERS; INSOMNIA; FATIGUE; COMPLAINTS; IMPACT; DEPRIVATION	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern in industrialised countries. Sleep and wake disturbances are among the most persistent and disabling sequelae after TBI. Yet, despite the widespread complaints of post-TBI sleep and wake disturbances, studies on their etiology, pathophysiology, and treatments remain inconclusive. This narrative review aims to summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the nature of sleep and wake disturbances following TBI, both subjective and objective, spanning all levels of severity and phases post-injury. A second goal is to outline the various causes of post-TBI sleep-wake disturbances. Globally, although sleep-wake complaints are reported in all studies and across all levels of severity, consensus regarding the objective nature of these disturbances is not unanimous and varies widely across studies. In order to optimise recovery in TBI survivors, further studies are required to shed light on the complexity and heterogeneity of post-TBI sleep and wake disturbances, and to fully grasp the best timing and approach for intervention.

Neuroimaging studies in primary insomnia remain relatively few, considering the important prevalence of this disorder in the general population. This review examines the contribution of functional and structural neuroimaging to our current understanding of primary insomnia. Functional studies during sleep provided support for the hyperarousal theory of insomnia. Functional neuroimaging also revealed abnormalities in cognitive and emotional processing in primary insomnia. Results from structural studies suggest neuroanatomical alterations in primary insomnia, mostly in the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. However, these results are not well replicated across studies. A few magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies revealed abnormalities in neurotransmitter concentrations and bioenergetics in primary insomnia. The inconsistencies among neuroimaging findings on insomnia are likely due to clinical heterogeneity, differences in imaging and overall diversity of techniques and designs employed. Larger samples, replication, as well as innovative methodologies are necessary for the progression of this perplexing, yet promising area of research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Placebo analgesia and sleep	PATHOLOGIE BIOLOGIE			French	Review						Placebo; Pain; Sleep; Paradoxical sleep; Expectation of relief	EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; INDUCED EXPECTATIONS; REM-SLEEP; NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; PAIN PERCEPTION; BRAIN; REWARD; DEPRIVATION; NETWORK	The placebo response is a psychobiological phenomenon for clinical benefits following the administration of an inert substance whatever its form. This phenomenon can be attributed to a wide range of neurobiological processes, such as expectations of relief, the Pavlovian conditioning and learning, emotional regulation, and reward mechanisms, which are themselves under the influence of processes that take place during sleep. The study of placebo analgesia in healthy from a placebo conditioning associated with analgesic suggestions has highlighted a relationship between sleep, expectations of relief and placebo analgesia: when the induction is persuasive before sleep, expectations of relief modulate placebo response the next morning and paradoxical sleep correlates negatively with both expectations and the placebo response. When the analgesic experience before sleep is less persuasive, expectations of relief are still present but no longer interact with placebo analgesia while paradoxical sleep no longer correlates with the analgesic placebo response. Sleep-processes especially during paradoxical sleep seem to influence the relationship between expectations of relief and placebo analgesia. In this review, we describe the relationship between sleep and placebo analgesia, the mechanisms involved in the placebo response (e.g., conditioning, learning, memory, reward) and their potential link with sleep that could make it a special time for the building placebo response.

The effect of sleep restriction on neurobehavioural functioning in normally developing children and adolescents: Insights from the attention behaviour and sleep laboratory	PATHOLOGIE BIOLOGIE			English	Review						Sleep restriction; Neurobehavioral functioning; Attention; Children; Adolescents	SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; INADEQUATE SLEEP; DURATION; PERFORMANCE; HEALTH; IMPACT; DISTURBANCES; CONSEQUENCES; FEASIBILITY	In the current paper, we first introduce the research themes of the attention, behaviour and sleep (ABS) laboratory, namely, sleep and ADHD, sleep and obesity, and sleep and academic performance. We then focus in on the topic to be reviewed in the current paper - the association between sleep restriction and neurobehavioral functioning (NBF) in typically developing children. We review the research thus far conducted by the ABS lab specific to this topic and posit the unique methodological contributions of the ABS lab (e.g. home-based assessment of sleep architecture and patterns, extensive phenotyping, etc.) in terms of advancing this research area. In the second section of the paper, we review 13 studies investigating the causal association between experimental sleep restriction and NBF in normally developing pediatric populations. Eight of the 13 studies found that sleep restriction causes impairments in neurobehavioural functioning. However, given the inconsistency in outcome measures, experimental protocols and statistical power, the studies reviewed herein are difficult to interpret. Strategies used by the ABS including implementing home assessments of sleep, restricting sleep relative to the participants' typical sleep schedules, blinding raters who assess NBF, and using valid and reliable NBF assessments are an attempt to address the gaps in this research area and clarify the causal relationship between sleep restriction and NBF in typically developing children and adolescents.

A group of healthy and a group of subclinically depressed participants underwent a modified Montreal Imaging Stress task (MIST), a mild neuroimaging psychosocial task and completed state self-esteem and mood measures. Cortisol levels were assessed throughout the session. All participants showed a decrease in performance self-esteem levels following the MIST. Yet, the decline in performance self-esteem levels was associated with increased levels of anxiety and confusion in the healthy group, but increased levels of depression in the subclinical group, following the MIST. The subclinical group showed overall lower cortisol levels compared with the healthy group. The degree of change in activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in response to negative evaluation was associated with increased levels of depression in the whole sample. Findings suggest that even in response to a mild psychosocial challenge, those individuals vulnerable to depression already show important maladaptive response patterns at psychological and neural levels. The findings point to important targets for future interventions.

Imaging advancements have led to increasingly common identification of prominent trabeculations with unknown implications. We quantified and determined the impact of trabeculations' burden on cardiac function and stretch in a population of healthy young adults. One hundred adults aged 18 to 35 years (28 +/- 4 years, 55% women) without known cardiovascular disease were prospectively studied by cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Left ventricular (LV) volumes, segmental function, and ejection fraction (EF) and left atrial volumes were determined. Thickness and area of trabeculated (T) and dense (D) myocardium were measured for each standardized LV segment. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (Nt-pro-BNP) was measured. Eighteen percent of the subjects had >= 1 positive traditional criteria for NCC, and 11% meet new proposed NCC cardiovascular magnetic resonance criteria. Trabeculated over dense myocardium ratio (T/D) ratios were uniformly greater at end-diastole versus end-systole (0.90 +/- 0.25 vs 0.42 +/- 0.13, p <0.0001), in women versus men (0.85 +/- 0.24 vs 0.72 +/- 0.19, p = 0.006), at anterior versus nonanterior segments (1.41 +/- 0.59 vs 0.88 +/- 0.35, p <0.0001), and at apical versus nonapical segments (1.31 +/- 0.56 vs 0.87 +/- 0.38, p <0.0001). The largest T/D ratios were associated with lower LVEF (57.0 +/- 5.3 vs 62 +/- 5.5, p = 0.0001) and greater Nt-pro-BNP (203 +/- 98 vs 155 +/- 103, p = 0.04). Multivariable regression identified greater end-systolic T/D ratios as the strongest independent predictor of lower LVEF, beyond age and gender, left atrial or LV volumes, and Nt-pro-BNP (beta = -9.9, 95% CI -15 to 4.9, p <0.001). In conclusion, healthy adults possess variable amounts of trabeculations that regularly meet criteria for NCC. Greater trabeculations are associated with decreased LV function. Apparently healthy young adults with increased trabecular burden possess evidence of mildly impaired cardiac function. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Participants in an fMRI study (n=48) gave rewards (money) or punishments (electroshocks) to in-group or out-group members. The results show that when participants rewarded others, greater activation was found in regions typically associated with receiving rewards such as the striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilaterally. Activation in those regions increased when participants rewarded in-group compared to out-group members. Punishment led to increased activation in regions typically associated with Theory of Mind including the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus, as well as regions typically associated with perceiving others in pain such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Interestingly, in contrast to the findings regarding reward, activity in these regions was not moderated by whether the target of the punishment was an in- or out-group member. Additional regression analysis revealed that participants who have low perspective taking skills and higher levels of psychopathy showed less activation in the brain regions identified when punishing others, especially when they were out-group members. In sum, when an individual is personally responsible for delivering rewards and punishments to others, in-group bias is stronger for reward allocation than punishments, marking the first neuroscientific evidence of this dissociation.

Louis			Rapid Automatic Segmentation of the Human Cerebellum and its Lobules (RASCAL)-Implementation and Application of the Patch-based Label-fusion Technique With a Template Library to Segment the Human Cerebellum	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						cerebellum; segmentation; MRI; lobules	COGNITIVE-AFFECTIVE SYNDROME; HUMAN BRAIN; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; NEUROANATOMICAL STRUCTURES; MR-IMAGES; ATLAS; HIPPOCAMPUS; SEX; REGISTRATION; RELIABILITY	Reliable and fast segmentation of the human cerebellum with its complex architecture of lobes and lobules has been a challenge for the past decades. Emerging knowledge of the functional integration of the cerebellum in various sensori-motor and cognitive-behavioral circuits demands new automatic segmentation techniques, with accuracies similar to manual segmentations, but applicable to large subject numbers in a reasonable time frame. This article presents the development and application of a novel pipeline for rapid automatic segmentation of the human cerebellum and its lobules (RASCAL) combining patch-based label-fusion and a template library of manually labeled cerebella of 16 healthy controls from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) database. Leave-one-out experiments revealed a good agreement between manual and automatic segmentations (Dice kappa=0.82). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to test reliability of segmented volumes and were highest (ICC>0.9) for global measures (total and hemispherical grey and white matter) followed by larger lobules of the posterior lobe (ICC>0.8). Further we applied the pipeline to all 152 young healthy controls of the ICBM database to look for hemispheric and gender differences. The results demonstrated larger native space volumes in men then women (mean (+/- SD) total cerebellar volume in women=217 cm(3) (+/- 26), men=259 cm(3) (+/- 29); P<0.001). Significant gender-by-hemisphere interaction was only found in stereotaxic space volumes for white matter core (men>women) and anterior lobe volume (women>men). This new method shows great potential for the precise and efficient analysis of the cerebellum in large patient cohorts. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5026-5039, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Oxytocin (OXT) modulates amygdala connectivity and attenuates responses to psychosocial stress, but its effect appears to be moderated by ELS. Here we first investigate the effect of ELS on amygdala-prefrontal rs-FC, and examine whether ELS-associated changes of rs-FC in this neural circuit predict its response to psychosocial stress. Secondly, we explore the joint effect of OXT and ELS on the amygdala-prefrontal circuit. Eighteen healthy young males participated in a resting-state fMRI study of OXT effects using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design. We measured the rs-FC to bilateral amygdalae and subsequently assessed changes of state anxiety and prefrontal responses to psychosocial stress. Multiple linear regressions showed that ELS, specifically emotional abuse, predicted reduced rs-FC between the right amygdala and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), which in turn predicted elevated state anxiety after psychosocial stress. In subjects with lower ELS scores, stronger pgACC-amygdala rs-FC predicted stronger pgACC deactivation during the psychosocial stress task, and this rest-task interaction was attenuated by OXT. In subjects with higher ELS scores however, the rest-task interaction was altered and OXT showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that ELS reduces pgACC-amygdala rs-FC and alters how rs-FC of this circuit predicts its stress responsiveness. Such changes in pgACC-amygdala functional dynamics may underlie the altered sensitivity to the effects of OXT after ELS. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5328-5339, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SORCS1 is necessary for normal insulin secretory granule biogenesis in metabolically stressed beta cells	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article							TRANS-GOLGI NETWORK; PROPROTEIN CONVERTASES; NEURONAL VIABILITY; PANCREATIC-ISLETS; ZINC TRANSPORTER; ATT-20 CELLS; SORTILIN; RECEPTOR; TRAFFICKING; LOCUS	We previously positionally cloned Sorcs1 as a diabetes quantitative trait locus. Sorcs1 belongs to the Vacuolar protein sorting-10 (Vps10) gene family. In yeast, Vps10 transports enzymes from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the vacuole. Whole-body Sorcs1 KO mice, when made obese with the leptin(ob) mutation (ob/ob), developed diabetes. beta Cells from these mice had a severe deficiency of secretory granules (SGs) and insulin. Interestingly, a single secretagogue challenge failed to consistently elicit an insulin secretory dysfunction. However, multiple challenges of the Sorcs1 KO ob/ob islets consistently revealed an insulin secretion defect. The luminal domain of SORCS1 (Lum-Sorcs1), when expressed in a beta cell line, acted as a dominant-negative, leading to SG and insulin deficiency. Using syncollin-dsRedSTIMER adenovirus, we found that the loss of Sorcs1 function greatly impairs the rapid replenishment of SGs following secretagogue challenge. Chronic exposure of islets from lean Sorcs1 KO mice to high glucose and palmitate depleted insulin content and evoked an insulin secretion defect. Thus, in metabolically stressed mice, Sorcs1 is important for SG replenishment, and under chronic challenge by insulin secretagogues, loss of Sorcs1 leads to diabetes. Overexpression of full-length SORCS1 led to a 2-fold increase in SG content, suggesting that SORCS1 is sufficient to promote SG biogenesis.

The Effect of Fractionated Radiotherapy in Sensorineural Hearing Loss: An Animal Model	LARYNGOSCOPE			English	Article						Radiotherapy; sensorineural hearing loss; ABR; DPOAE; guinea pig	X-RAY-IRRADIATION; GUINEA-PIG; NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA; INNER-EAR; NECK-CANCER; RADIATION; COCHLEA; RADIOSURGERY; DOSIMETRY; HEAD	Objectives/HypothesisThe purpose of this study is to assess the effect of fractionated radiotherapy on sensorineural hearing loss using an animal model. Study DesignIn vivo animal study. MethodsEars of 25 guinea pigs were divided into three groups: control, irradiated with a total of 48 gray (Gy), and 71 Gy. Unilateral exposure of 48 Gy and 71 Gy fractionated irradiation was given for a 4-week period. Auditory brainstem response and distortion products otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were tested prior to irradiation and 1, 6, 10, and 16 weeks after completion of radiotherapy to assess the hearing threshold shift postradiotherapy over time. ResultsNo significant differences in hearing thresholds between the low dose radiation (48 Gy) and the control group (no radiation) underlined that 48 Gy caused no hearing deficits (P=0.37). The higher dose (71 Gy) showed progressive deterioration of the hearing function over time. Three-way ANOVA interactions revealed significant group-time effects (F= 9.261; P<0.0001). DPOAE analysis demonstrated hearing loss at 71 Gy without progression or recovery at all time points, predominantly in the higher frequencies tested. ConclusionThe present study suggests that in the presence of sensorineural hearing loss due to high- dose fractionated radiotherapy, there is an initial sensorial component; however, the neural component is responsible for its progressivity.

Existing data underscore the importance of Al physical and chemical forms in relation to its uptake, accumulation, and systemic bioavailability. The present review represents a systematic examination of the peer-reviewed literature on the adverse health effects of Al materials published since a previous critical evaluation compiled by Krewski et al. (2007). Challenges encountered in carrying out the present review reflected the experimental use of different physical and chemical Al forms, different routes of administration, and different target organs in relation to the magnitude, frequency, and duration of exposure. Wide variations in diet can result in Al intakes that are often higher than the World Health Organization provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI), which is based on studies with Al citrate. Comparing daily dietary Al exposures on the basis of "total Al" assumes that gastrointestinal bioavailability for all dietary Al forms is equivalent to that for Al citrate, an approach that requires validation. Current occupational exposure limits (OELs) for identical Al substances vary as much as 15-fold. The toxicity of different Al forms depends in large measure on their physical behavior and relative solubility in water. The toxicity of soluble Al forms depends upon the delivered dose of Al. 3 to target tissues. Trivalent Al reacts with water to produce bidentate superoxide coordination spheres [Al(O-2)(H2O4)(+2) and Al(H2O)(6)(+3)] that after complexation with O-2(center dot-), generate Al super-oxides [Al(O-2(center dot))](H2O5)](+2). Semireduced AlO2 center dot radicals deplete mitochondrial Fe and promote generation of H2O2, O-2(center dot-). and OH center dot. Thus, it is the Al+3-induced formation of oxygen radicals that accounts for the oxidative damage that leads to intrinsic apoptosis. In contrast, the toxicity of the insoluble Al oxides depends primarily on their behavior as particulates. Aluminum has been held responsible for human morbidity and mortality, but there is no consistent and convincing evidence to associate the Al found in food and drinking water at the doses and chemical forms presently consumed by people living in North America and Western Europe with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neither is there clear evidence to show use of Al-containing underarm antiperspirants or cosmetics increases the risk of AD or breast cancer. Metallic Al, its oxides, and common Al salts have not been shown to be either genotoxic or carcinogenic. Aluminum exposures during neonatal and pediatric parenteral nutrition (PN) can impair bone mineralization and delay neurological development. Adverse effects to vaccines with Al adjuvants have occurred; however, recent controlled trials found that the immunologic response to certain vaccines with Al adjuvants was no greater, and in some cases less than, that after identical vaccination without Al adjuvants. The scientific literature on the adverse health effects of Al is extensive. Health risk assessments for Al must take into account individual co-factors (e.g., age, renal function, diet, gastric pH). Conclusions from the current review point to the need for refinement of the PTWI, reduction of Al contamination in PN solutions, justification for routine addition of Al to vaccines, and harmonization of OELs for Al substances.

A new pathway for mitochondrial quality control: mitochondrial-derived vesicles	EMBO JOURNAL			English	Review						mitochondria; Parkin; PINK1; quality control; vesicle transport	E3 UBIQUITIN LIGASE; EXTRACELLULAR ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; HEREDITARY SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA; OUTER-MEMBRANE VESICLES; M-AAA PROTEASE; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; PARKINSON-DISEASE; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; UNCONVENTIONAL SECRETION; PEROXISOMAL FISSION	The last decade has been marked by tremendous progress in our understanding of the cell biology of mitochondria, with the identification of molecules and mechanisms that regulate their fusion, fission, motility, and the architectural transitions within the inner membrane. More importantly, the manipulation of these machineries in tissues has provided links between mitochondrial dynamics and physiology. Indeed, just as the proteins required for fusion and fission were identified, they were quickly linked to both rare and common human diseases. This highlighted the critical importance of this emerging field to medicine, with new hopes of finding drugable targets for numerous pathologies, from neurodegenerative diseases to inflammation and cancer. In the midst of these exciting new discoveries, an unexpected new aspect of mitochondrial cell biology has been uncovered; the generation of small vesicular carriers that transport mitochondrial proteins and lipids to other intracellular organelles. These mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) were first found to transport a mitochondrial outer membrane protein MAPL to a subpopulation of peroxisomes. However, other MDVs did not target peroxisomes and instead fused with the late endosome, or multivesicular body. The Parkinson's disease-associated proteins Vps35, Parkin, and PINK1 are involved in the biogenesis of a subset of these MDVs, linking this novel trafficking pathway to human disease. In this review, we outline what has been learned about the mechanisms and functional importance of MDV transport and speculate on the greater impact of these pathways in cellular physiology.

Modulation of spike clustering by NMDA receptors and neurotensin in rat supraoptic nucleus neurons	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							LAMINA TERMINALIS NEURONS; IN-VITRO; VASOPRESSIN NEURONS; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; EXCITATION; RESPONSES; OXYTOCIN; CHANNELS; RELEASE; HYPOTHALAMUS	Magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) in the rat supraoptic nucleus display clustered firing during hyperosmolality or dehydration. This response is beneficial because this type of activity potentiates vasopressin secretion from axon terminals in the neurohypophysis and thus promotes homoeostatic water reabsorption from the kidney. However, the mechanisms which lead to the generation of clustering activity in MNCs remain unknown. Previous work has shown that clustered firing can be induced in these neurons through the pharmacological activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and that silent pauses observed during this activity are mediated by apamin-sensitive calcium activated potassium (SK) channels. However, it remains unknown if clustered firing can be induced in situ by endogenous glutamate release from axon terminals. Here we show that electrical stimulation of glutamatergic osmosensory afferents in the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) can promote clustering in MNCs via NMDARs and apamin-sensitive channels. We also show that the rate of spike clustering induced by NMDA varies as a bell-shaped function of voltage, and that partial inhibition of SK channels can increase cluster duration and reduce the rate of clustering. Finally, we show that MNCs express neurotensin type 2 receptors, and that activation of these receptors can simultaneously depolarize MNCs and suppress clustered firing induced by bath application of NMDA or by repetitive stimulation of glutamate afferents. These studies reveal that spike clustering can be induced in MNCs by glutamate release from afferent nerve terminals and that that this type of activity can be fine-tuned by neuromodulators such as neurotensin.

Treatment outcomes of childhood tuberculous meningitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis	LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Review							SHORT COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; ACID AMPLIFICATION TESTS; CHILDREN; DIAGNOSIS; VACCINATION; RIFAMPICIN; INFANTS; ADULTS; TRIAL	Background Tuberculous meningitis disproportionately affects young children. We aimed to characterise treatment outcomes for this deadliest and most debilitating form of tuberculosis. Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of childhood tuberculous meningitis studies published up to Oct 12,2012. We included study reports that applied predefined diagnostic criteria and described treatment regimens and outcomes. We pooled risks of death during treatment and neurological sequelae among survivors. As secondary objectives, we assessed study-level characteristics as sources of heterogeneity, and we pooled frequencies of presenting symptoms and diagnostic findings. For all meta-analyses we used random-effects models with the exact binomial likelihood method. Findings 19 studies met our inclusion criteria, with reported treatment outcomes for 1636 children. Risk of death was 19.3% (95% CI 14.0-26.1) and probability of survival without neurological sequelae was 36.7% (27.9-46.4). Among survivors, risk of neurological sequelae was 53.9% (95% CI 42.6-64.9). Diagnosis in the most advanced disease stage (3) occurred in 307 (47%) of 657 patients and was associated with worse outcomes than was earlier diagnosis. The most common findings at presentation were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leucocytosis (frequency 99.9%, 95% CI 68.5-100.0), CSF lymphocytosis (97.9%, 51.9-100.0), fever (89.8%, 79.8-95.2), and hydrocephalus (86.1%, 68.6-94.6). Frequency of CS F acid-fast-bacilli smear positivity was 8.9% (95% CI 5.0-15.4), and frequency of C SF culture positivity for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 35.1% (16.8-59.2). Interpretation Despite treatment, childhood tuberculous meningitis has very poor outcomes. Poor prognosis and difficult early diagnosis emphasise the importance of preventive therapy for child contacts of patients with tuberculosis and low threshold for empirical treatment of tuberculous meningitis suspects. Implementation of consensus definitions, standardised reporting of data, and high-quality clinical trials are needed to clarify optimum therapy.

Impact of Frequency Drift on Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid-Edited MR Spectroscopy	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						edited MRS; GABA; frequency drift; subtraction artifact; editing efficiency	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; GABA CONCENTRATION; HUMAN BRAIN; IN-VIVO; SIGNAL LOSS; MEGA-PRESS; 3 TESLA; SPECTRA; WATER	PurposeTo investigate the quantitative impact of frequency drift on Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA+)-edited MRS of the human brain at 3 Tesla (T). MethodsThree sequential GABA+-edited MEGA-PRESS acquisitions were acquired in fifteen sessions; in ten of these, MRS was preceded by functional MRI (fMRI) to induce frequency drift, which was estimated from the creatine resonance at 3.0 ppm. Simulations were performed to examine the effects of frequency drift on the editing efficiency of GABA and co-edited macromolecules (MM) and of subtraction artifacts on GABA+ quantification. The efficacy of postprocessing frequency correction was also investigated. ResultsGradient-induced frequency drifts affect GABA+ quantification for at least 30 min after imaging. Average frequency drift was low in control sessions and as high as -2 Hz/min after fMRI. Uncorrected frequency drift has an approximately linear effect on GABA+ measurements with a -10 Hz drift resulting in a 16% decrease in GABA+, primarily due to subtraction artifacts. ConclusionImaging acquisitions with high gradient duty cycles can impact subsequent GABA+ measurements. Postprocessing can address subtraction artifacts, but not changes in editing efficiency or GABA:MM signal ratios; therefore, protocol design should avoid intensive gradient sequences before edited MRS Magn Reson Med 72:941-948, 2014.

Methods: Government hospital discharge, physician, and pharmaceutical claims data were linked to identify individuals with schizophrenia who in 2004 had antipsychotics available to them for at least 11 months. Individuals on a high dose throughout that period, as well as individuals on multiple concurrent antipsychotics (polypharmacy), were identified. Logistic and generalized linear mixed models using patient-, physician-, and hospitallevel predictors were estimated. Results: Among the 12,150 individuals identified, 11.9% were on a high dose and 10.4% on antipsychotic polypharmacy continually, with 3.7% in both groups. After adjustment for potential confounders, analyses showed that systematic propensity for physicians to prescribe high doses accounted for 10.9% of the remaining unexplained variance, and physicians as a group who prescribed high doses across a hospital or psychiatry department accounted for 3.0%. For antipsychotic polypharmacy the corresponding percentages were 9.7% and 6.2%. Even after adjustment, the variation in high-dose prescribing and antipsychotic polypharmacy remained substantial. Conclusions: Long-term high-dose and antipsychotic polypharmacy prescribing appeared partly driven by some physicians' and some hospitals' propensities to prescribe in this way independently of patient characteristics. Given the weight of the evidence against high-dose prescribing and antipsychotic polypharmacy, measures addressed to physicians and hospitals most likely to prescribe high doses, antipsychotic polypharmacy, or both should be considered.

In our opinion, nucleoli and SGs are functionally linked; they are distant relatives that combine forces when cellular homeostasis is threatened. Several lines of evidence support this idea; nucleoli and SGs share molecular building blocks, are regulated by common signaling pathways and communicate when vital cellular functions become compromised. Together, nucleoli and SGs orchestrate physiological responses that are directly relevant to stress and human health. As both compartments have established roles in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and virus infections, we propose that these conditions will benefit from therapeutic interventions that target simultaneously nucleoli and SGs.

We recently identified a germ-line DICER1 mutation in a child with a PinB. This was accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele within the tumour. We set out to establish the prevalence of DICER1 mutations in an opportunistically ascertained series of PinBs. Twenty-one PinB cases were studied: Eighteen cases had not undergone previous testing for DICER1 mutations; three patients were known carriers of germ-line DICER1 mutations. The eighteen PinBs were sequenced by Sanger and/or Fluidigm-based next-generation sequencing to identify DICER1 mutations in blood gDNA and/or tumour gDNA. Testing for somatic DICER1 mutations was also conducted on one case with a known germ-line DICER1 mutation. From the eighteen PinBs, we identified four deleterious DICER1 mutations, three of which were germ line in origin, and one for which a germ line versus somatic origin could not be determined; in all four, the second allele was also inactivated leading to complete loss of DICER1 protein. No somatic DICER1 RNase IIIb mutations were identified. One PinB arising in a germ-line DICER1 mutation carrier was found to have LOH. This study suggests that germ-line DICER1 mutations make a clinically significant contribution to PinB, establishing DICER1 as an important susceptibility gene for PinB and demonstrates PinB to be a manifestation of a germ-line DICER1 mutation. The means by which the second allele is inactivated may differ from other DICER1-related tumours.

These results have been explained in terms of two right-hemisphere properties: (i) that emotional stimuli are preferentially processed in the RH and (ii) that visual stimuli are represented more coarsely in the RI-I. According to this account, false emotional memories are preferentially produced in the RH because emotional stimuli are both more strongly and more diffusely activated during encoding, leaving a memory trace that can be erroneously reactivated by similar but unstudied emotional items at test. If this right-hemisphere hypothesis is correct, then RH damage should result in a reduction in false memories to emotional stimuli relative to left-hemisphere lesions. To investigate this possibility, groups of right-brain-damaged (RBD, N = 15), left-brain-damaged (LBD, N = 15) and healthy (HC, N = 30) participants took part in a recognition memory experiment with emotional (negative and positive) and non-emotional pictures. False memories were operationalized as incorrect responses to unstudied pictures that were similar to studied ones. Both RBD and LBD participants showed similar reductions in false memories for negative pictures relative to controls. For positive pictures, however, false memories were reduced only in RBD patients. The results provide only partial support for the right-hemisphere hypothesis and suggest that inter-hemispheric cooperation models may be necessary to fully account for false emotional memories.

Here, in a large sample of healthy adolescents stratified by sex and Val(158)Met genotype (n = 1133), we examine BOLD responses during performance of the stop-signal task in right-hemispheric prefrontal regions fundamental to inhibitory control. A significant sex-by-genotype interaction was observed in pre-SMA during successful-inhibition trials and in both pre-SMA and inferior frontal cortex during failed-inhibition trials with Val homozygotes displaying elevated activation compared with other genotypes in males but not in females. BOLD activation in the same regions significantly mediated the relationship between COMT genotype and inhibitory proficiency as indexed by stop-signal reaction time in males alone. These sexually dimorphic effects of COMT on inhibitory brain activation have important implications for our understanding of the contrasting patterns of prefrontally governed psychopathology observed in males and females.

Distinct Mu, Delta, and Kappa Opioid Receptor Mechanisms Underlie Low Sociability and Depressive-Like Behaviors During Heroin Abstinence	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS; CHRONIC MORPHINE; OPPOSING ALTERATIONS; OPIATE WITHDRAWAL; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; SEROTONIN EFFLUX; ADULT MICE; STRESS	Addiction is a chronic disorder involving recurring intoxication, withdrawal, and craving episodes. Escaping this vicious cycle requires maintenance of abstinence for extended periods of time and is a true challenge for addicted individuals. The emergence of depressive symptoms, including social withdrawal, is considered a main cause for relapse, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we establish a mouse model of protracted abstinence to heroin, a major abused opiate, where both emotional and working memory deficits unfold. We show that delta and kappa opioid receptor (DOR and KOR, respectively) knockout mice develop either stronger or reduced emotional disruption during heroin abstinence, establishing DOR and KOR activities as protective and vulnerability factors, respectively, that regulate the severity of abstinence. Further, we found that chronic treatment with the antidepressant drug fluoxetine prevents emergence of low sociability, with no impact on the working memory deficit, implicating serotonergic mechanisms predominantly in emotional aspects of abstinence symptoms. Finally, targeting the main serotonergic brain structure, we show that gene knockout of mu opioid receptors (MORs) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) before heroin exposure abolishes the development of social withdrawal. This is the first result demonstrating that intermittent chronic MOR activation at the level of DRN represents an essential mechanism contributing to low sociability during protracted heroin abstinence. Altogether, our findings reveal crucial and distinct roles for all three opioid receptors in the development of emotional alterations that follow a history of heroin exposure and open the way towards understanding opioid system-mediated serotonin homeostasis in heroin abuse.

We explore if externalizing behavior mediates this relationship, while controlling for a number of potential covariates of this mediation process. Methods We used data obtained in two geographically distinct community samples of adolescents. The first (cross-sectional) sample consisted of 996 adolescents (12-18 years of age) recruited from the Saguenay Youth Study (SYS) in Canada (47% with PEMCS). The second (longitudinal) sample consisted of 1141 adolescents (49% with PEMCS) from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC1986). In both samples, externalizing behavior and substance use were assessed during adolescence. In the NFBC1986 cohort, externalizing behavior was also assessed in childhood. Results In both populations, PEMCS is associated with a higher likelihood of adolescent drug experimentation. In the NFBC1986 cohort, exposed (versus non-exposed) adolescents experiment with an extra 1.27 [B = 0.24, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.15, 0.33 P<0.001] drugs. In the SYS cohort, a clear protective effect of not being exposed is shown: non-exposed (versus exposed) adolescents are 1.5 times [B = -0.42, 95% CI = -0.75, -0.09, P=0.013] less likely to take drugs. These associations between PEMCS and drug experimentation remain in the multivariate and mediational analyses. Conclusions Prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking appears to be associated with a higher probability of experimenting with drugs during adolescence, both directly and indirectly via externalizing behavior and the number of peers reported as using drugs.

Studies of model organisms revealed the involvement of some DNA replication and repair genes in the process of repeat instability, however, little is known about their role in patients. Here, we used an association study to search for genetic modifiers of (CAG)(n) instability in 137 parent-child transmissions in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3). With the hypothesis that variants in genes involved in DNA replication, repair or recombination might alter the MJD CAG instability patterns, we screened 768 SNPs from 93 of these genes. We found a variant in ERCC6 (rs2228528) associated with an expansion bias of MJD alleles. When using a gene-gene interaction model, the allele combination G-A (rs4140804-rs2972388) of RPA3-CDK7 is also associated with MJD instability in a direction-dependent manner. Interestingly, the transcription-coupled repair factor ERCC6 (aka CSB), the single-strand binding protein RPA, and the CDK7 kinase part of the TFIIH transcription repair complex, have all been linked to transcription-coupled repair. This is the first study performed in patient samples to implicate specific modifiers of CAG instability in humans. In summary, we found variants in three transcription-coupled repair genes associated with the MJD mutation that points to distinct mechanisms of (CAG)(n) instability.

Neurodevelopmental disorders in children born to mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus	LUPUS			English	Review						Systemic lupus erythematosus; neurodevelopmental disorders; pregnancy	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT; ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME; FETAL; RISK; ASSOCIATION; ANTIBODIES; PREGNANCY; EXPOSURE	Children born to women with systemic lupus erythematosus seem to have a potentially increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children born to healthy women. Recent experimental data suggest in utero exposure to maternal antibodies and cytokines as important risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. Interestingly, women with systemic lupus erythematosus display high levels of autoantibodies and cytokines, which have been shown, in animal models, to alter fetal brain development and induce behavioral anomalies in offspring. Furthermore, subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus and neurodevelopmental disorders share a common genetic predisposition, which could impair the fetal immune response to in utero immunologic insults. Moreover, systemic lupus erythematosus pregnancies are at increased risk of adverse obstetrical outcomes and medication exposures, which have been implicated as potential risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge on neurodevelopmental disorders and their potential determinants in systemic lupus erythematosus offspring.

Here we tested early blind, late blind and sighted control participants in two counting tasks, each performed under three different conditions: a resting condition, a condition requiring hands movements and a condition requiring feet movements. In the resting condition, every sighted and late blind spontaneously used their fingers, while the majority of early blind did not. Sighted controls and late blind were moreover selectively disrupted by the interfering hand condition, while the early blind who did not use the finger-counting strategy remained unaffected by the interference conditions. These results therefore demonstrate that visual experience plays an important role in implementing the sensori-motor habits that drive the development of finger-number interactions.

The olfactory epithelium, which arises from the olfactory pit, is a stratified tissue in which the stepwise generation of neurons and support cells can easily be assessed and followed during embryogenesis and throughout adulthood. During olfactory epithelium morphogenesis, progenitor cells respond to factors that control their proliferation, survival, and differentiation in order to generate olfactory receptor neurons that detect odorants in the environment and glia-like sustentacular cells. The tight temporal regulation of expression of proneural genes in dividing progenitor cells, including Mash-1, Neurogenin-1, and NeuroD1, plays a central role in the production of olfactory receptor neurons. Multiple factors that either positively or negatively affect the generation of olfactory receptor neurons have been identified and shown to impinge on the transcriptional regulatory network in dividing progenitor cells. Several growth factors, such as FGF-8, act to promote neurogenesis by ensuring survival of progenitor cells that will give rise to olfactory receptor neurons. In contrast, other molecules, including members of the large TGF-beta family of proteins, have negative impacts on neurogenesis by restricting progenitor cell proliferation and stalling their differentiation. Since recent reviews have focused on neurogenesis in the regenerating adult olfactory epithelium, this review describes neurogenesis at embryonic stages of olfactory epithelium development and summarizes our current understanding of how both cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors control this process.

C-Pulse Trial Study Grp	Ambulatory Extra-Aortic Counterpulsation in Patients With Moderate to Severe Chronic Heart Failure	JACC-HEART FAILURE			English	Article						counterpulsation; C-Pulse; extra-aortic; heart failure; multicenter	INTRAAORTIC BALLOON COUNTERPULSATION; TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; CIRCULATORY SUPPORT; ASSOCIATION; AUGMENTATION; TRANSPLANT; UPDATE; BRIDGE; PUMP	OBJECTIVES The study sought to assess feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of a novel implantable extra-aortic counterpulsation system (C-Pulse) in functional class III and ambulatory functional class IV heart failure (HF) patients. BACKGROUND 30% to 40% of HF patients suffer from poor functional status and quality of life (QoL) but are not in need of end-stage treatments. We undertook a multicenter single-arm study to assess the C-Pulse System in such patients. METHODS New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or ambulatory functional class IV HF patients were eligible. Safety was assessed continuously through 12 months. Efficacy measurements included changes from baseline to 6 and 12 months in NYHA functional class, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLWHF) and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and exercise peak oxygen consumption (pVO(2); 6 months only). RESULTS Twelve men and 8 women (56.7 +/- 7 years, 34 to 71 years of age) with ischemic (n = 7) or nonischemic (n = 13) cardiomyopathy were implanted. There was no 30-day mortality and no neurological events or myocardial infarctions through 12 months. At 6 months, there were 3 deaths (1 device-related). One-year survival was 85%. At 6 months, C-Pulse produced improvements in NYHA functional class (3.1 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.7, p = 0.0005), MLWHF (63.6 +/- 19.9 to 40.2 +/- 23.2, p = 0.0005), and KCCQ scores (43.6 +/- 21.1 to 65.6 +/- 21.5, p = 0.0002), but not 6MWD (275.5 +/- 64.0 to 296.4 +/- 104.9, p = NS) or pVO(2) (14.5 +/- 3.6 to 13.1 +/- 4.4, p = NS). Improvements continued at 12 months, with 6MWD change becoming statistically significant (336.5 +/- 91.8, p = 0.0425). CONCLUSIONS Use of C-Pulse in this population is feasible, appears safe, and improves functional status and QoL. A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial is underway.

A community sample of women was assessed at 12-14 weeks gestation, 32-34 weeks gestation, and 7-9 weeks postpartum. Oxytocin during late pregnancy was significantly positively correlated with a measure of theory of mind, and predicted theory of mind ability after controlling for parity, maternal education, prenatal psychosocial risk, and general anxiety, measured during the first trimester. Theory of mind was associated with less remote and less depressive maternal interactive behavior. Oxytocin, across all time points, was not directly related to maternal interactive behavior. However, there was a significant indirect effect of oxytocin during late pregnancy on depressive maternal behavior via theory of mind ability. These preliminary findings suggest that changes in the oxytocinergic system during the perinatal period may contribute to the awareness of social cues, which in turn plays a role in maternal interactive behavior.

Here, we have characterized the firing activity of DA neurons located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) using single-unit extracellular recordings in anesthetized rats kept on a standard light-dark cycle. DA neuronal firing activity was measured under basal conditions and in response to intravenous administration of increasing doses of amphetamine (AMPH: 0.5, 1, 2, 5 mg/kg), apomorphine (APO: 25, 50, 100, 200 mg/kg) and melatonin (MLT: 0.1, 1, 10 mg/kg) at different time intervals of the light-dark cycle. DA firing activity peaked between 07: 00 and 11: 00 h (3.5 +/- 0.3 Hz) and between 19:00 and 23:00 h (4.1 +/- 0.7 Hz), with lowest activity occurring between 11:00 and 15:00 h (2.4 +/- 0.2 Hz) and between 23:00 and 03:00 h (2.6 +/- 0.2 Hz). The highest number of spontaneously active neurons was observed between 03:00 and 06:00 h (2.5 +/- 0.3 neurons/track), whereas the lowest was between 19:00 and 23:00 h (1.5 +/- 0.2 neurons/track). The inhibitory effect of AMPH on DA firing rate was similar in both phases. The inhibitory effect of low dose of APO (25 mu g/kg, dose selective for D-2 autoreceptor) was more potent in the dark phase, whereas APO effects at higher doses were similar in both phases. Finally, MLT administration (1 mg/kg) produced a moderate inhibition of DA cell firing in both phases. These experiments demonstrate the existence of an intradiurnal rhythmic pattern of VTA DA neuronal firing activity and a higher pharmacological response of D-2 autoreceptors in the dark phase.

However, whether the amyloid pathology can trigger early inflammatory processes before plaque deposition remains a matter of debate. To address the possibility that a pre-plaque inflammatory process occurs, we investigated the status of neuronal, astrocytic, and microglial markers in pre- and post-amyloid plaque stages in a novel transgenic rat model of an AD-like amyloid pathology (McGill-R-Thy1-APP). In this model, we found a marked upregulation of several classical inflammatory markers such as COX-2, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and fractalkine (CX3CL1) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, many of these markers were highly expressed in amyloid beta-burdened neurons. Activated astrocytes and microglia were associated with these A beta-burdened neurons. These findings confirm the occurrence of a proinflammatory process preceding amyloid plaque deposition and suggest that A beta-burdened neurons play a crucial role in initiating inflammation in AD.

Work in our laboratory and others have shown that the striatum is associated with this off-line consolidation process. In this study, we aimed to quantify the sleep-dependent dynamic changes occurring at the network level using a measure of functional integration. We directly compared changes in connectivity before and after sleep or the simple passage of daytime. As predicted, the results revealed greater integration within the cortico-striatal network after sleep, but not an equivalent daytime period. Importantly, a similar pattern of results was also observed using a data-driven approach; the increase in integration being specific to a cortico-striatal network, but not to other known functional networks. These findings reveal, for the first time, a new signature of motor sequence consolidation: a greater between-regions interaction within the cortico-striatal system.

However, the natural variability of GABA levels in the human brain over long periods of time (>8 days) has not yet been studied. The purpose of this work was to investigate the long-term variability of GABA concentrations in the human occipital cortex. Nineteen healthy male participants were recruited and underwent two sessions of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to determine occipital GABA levels with an average between-session interval of 7 months. We assessed between-session variability, as well as the correlation between session 1 and session 2 GABA measurements. The mean coefficient of variation between sessions was 43% (bootstrap 95% confidence interval: 2.5, 6.4), which is comparable to reported GABA variability measurements over much shorter time intervals (<8 days). A significant positive correlation was observed between session 1 and session 2 GABA measurements (r = 0.53, p = 0.014), and the intra-class correlation coefficient was calculated to be 0.52 which was also statistically significant (p = 0.012). These findings establish experimentally that GABA concentrations in the occipital cortex, as measured by MRS, are relatively stable over periods as long as 7 months. The findings have significant implications for the internal validity of longitudinal studies of GABA levels in the human brain, and they lend foundational support to studies relating GABA levels to behavioural traits in healthy individuals.

Interoperable atlases of the human brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; HUMAN CORTICAL ANATOMY; WHITE-MATTER TRACTS; FUNCTIONAL CORRESPONDENCE; DIFFUSION TRACTOGRAPHY; CORTEX; AREAS; CONNECTIVITY; ALIGNMENT; MONKEY	The last two decades have seen an unprecedented development of human brain mapping approaches at various spatial and temporal scales. Together, these have provided a large fundus of information on many different aspects of the human brain including micro- and macrostructural segregation, regional specialization of function, connectivity, and temporal dynamics. Atlases are central in order to integrate such diverse information in a topographically meaningful way. It is noteworthy, that the brain mapping field has been developed along several major lines such as structure vs. function, postmortem vs. in vivo, individual features of the brain vs. population-based aspects, or slow vs. fast dynamics. In order to understand human brain organization, however, it seems inevitable that these different lines are integrated and combined into a multimodal human brain model. To this aim, we held a workshop to determine the constraints of a multi-modal human brain model that are needed to enable (i) an integration of different spatial and temporal scales and data modalities into a common reference system, and (ii) efficient data exchange and analysis. As detailed in this report, to arrive at fully interoperable atlases of the human brain will still require much work at the frontiers of data acquisition, analysis, and representation. Among them, the latter may provide the most challenging task, in particular when it comes to representing features of vastly different scales of space, time and abstraction. The potential benefits of such endeavor, however, clearly outweigh the problems, as only such kind of multi-modal human brain atlas may provide a starting point from which the complex relationships between structure, function, and connectivity may be explored.

Methods: We conducted a case-control study within a cohort of men aged 45 to 80 years in the United States followed from 2001 to 2011. Cases were defined as those with the first physician visit diagnosis of PN, polyneuropathy, or drug-induced polyneuropathy. Four controls were matched to each case by age, follow-up, and calendar time using density-based sampling. As a sensitivity analysis, we also quantified the risk of PN with finasteride use, a drug that is not expected to increase the risk of PN. Rate ratios (RRs) for current users of FQs were computed using conditional logistic regression, which was adjusted for chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, hypothyroidism, postherpetic neuralgia, and the use of nitrofurantoin and metronidazole. Results: We identified 6,226 cases and 24,904 controls. Current users of FQs were at a higher risk of developing PN (RR = 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-2.27). Current new users had the highest risk (RR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.56-2.74). No risk was observed for current users of finasteride (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.97-1.51). Conclusions: Current users, especially new users of FQs, are at a higher risk of developing PN. Despite the increase in the use of FQs, clinicians should weigh the benefits against the risk of adverse events when prescribing these drugs to their patients.

In the embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio), cutaneous Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory neurons fire in response to mechanical stimuli and excite downstream glutamatergic commissural primary ascending (CoPA) interneurons to produce a flexion response contralateral to the site of stimulus. In the absence of sensory stimuli, zebrafish spinal locomotor circuits are spontaneously active during development due to pacemaker activity resulting in repetitive coiling of the trunk. Self-generated movement must therefore be distinguishable from external stimuli in order to ensure the appropriate activation of touch reflexes. Here, we recorded from CoPAs during spontaneous and evoked fictive motor behaviors in order to examine how responses to self-movement are gated in sensory interneurons. During spontaneous coiling, CoPAs received glycinergic inputs coincident with contralateral flexions that shunted firing for the duration of the coiling event. Shunting inactivation of CoPAs was caused by a slowly deactivating chloride conductance that resulted in lowered membrane resistance and increased action potential threshold. During spontaneous burst swimming, which develops later, CoPAs received glycinergic inputs that arrived in phase with excitation to ipsilateral motoneurons and provided persistent shunting. During a touch stimulus, short latency glutamatergic inputs produced cationic currents through AMPA receptors that drove a single, large amplitude action potential in the CoPA before shunting inhibition began, providing a brief window for the activation of downstream neurons. We compared the properties of CoPAs to those of other spinal neurons and propose that glycinergic signaling onto CoPAs acts as a corollary discharge signal for reflex inhibition during movement.

During the first year of life, differential maturational changes have been observed between the Magnocellular (P) and the Parvocellular (P) visual pathways. However, few studies investigated P and M system development in infants born prematurely. The aim of the present study was to characterize P and M system maturational differences between healthy preterm and fullterm infants through a critical period of visual maturation: the first year of life. Using a cross-sectional design, high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in 31 healthy preterms and 41 fullterm infants of 3, 6, or 12 months (corrected age for premature babies). Three visual stimulations varying in contrast and spatial frequency were presented to stimulate preferentially the M pathway, the P pathway, or both systems simultaneously during EEG recordings. Results from early visual evoked potentials in response to the stimulation that activates simultaneously both systems revealed longer N1 latencies and smaller P1 amplitudes in preterm infants compared to fullterms. Moreover, preterms showed longer N1 and P1 latencies in response to stimuli assessing the M pathway at 3 months. No differences between preterms and fullterms were found when using the preferential P system stimulation. In order to identify the cerebral generator of each visual response, distributed source analyses were computed in 12-month-old infants using LORETA. Source analysis demonstrated an activation of the parietal dorsal region in fullterm infants, in response to the preferential M pathway, which was not seen in the preterms. Overall, these findings suggest that the Magnocellular pathway development is affected in premature infants. Although our VEP results suggest that premature children overcome, at least partially, the visual developmental delay with time, source analyses reveal abnormal brain activation of the Magnocellular pathway at 12 months of age.

In fetal sheep model of human labour, we reported that severe fetal acidemia(pH<7.00) during repetitive umbilical cord occlusions (UCOs) is preceded similar to 60 minutes by the synchronization of electroencephalogram (EEG) and FHR. However, EEG and FHR are cyclic and noisy, and although the synchronization might be visually evident, it is challenging to detect automatically, a necessary condition for bedside utility. Here we present and validate a novel non-parametric statistical method to detect fetal acidemia during labour by using EEG and FHR. The underlying algorithm handles non-stationary and noisy data by recording number of abnormal episodes in both EEG and FHR. A logistic regression is then deployed to test whether these episodes are significantly related to each other. We then apply the method in a prospective study of human labour using fetal sheep model (n=20). Our results render a PPV of 68% for detecting impending severe fetal acidemia similar to 60 min prior to pH drop to less than 7.00 with 100% negative predictive value. We conclude that this method has a great potential to improve PPV for detection of fetal acidemia when it is implemented at the bedside. We outline directions for further refinement of the algorithm that will be achieved by analyzing larger data sets acquired in prospective human pilot studies.

Developing virtual dynamic facial expressions of emotions, however, would open-up possibilities, both for fundamental and clinical research. For instance, virtual faces allow real-time Human Computer retroactions between physiological measures and the virtual agent. Objectives:The goal of this study was to initially assess concomitants and construct validity of a newly developed set of virtual faces expressing six fundamental emotions (happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust). Recognition rates, facial electromyography (zygomatic major and corrugator supercilii muscles), and regional gaze fixation latencies (eyes and mouth regions) were compared in 41 adult volunteers (20 male, 21 female) during the presentation of video clips depicting real vs. virtual adults expressing emotions. Results: Emotions expressed by each set of stimuli were similarly recognized, both by men and women. Accordingly, both sets of stimuli elicited similar activation of facial muscles and similar ocular fixation times in eye regions from man and woman participants. Conclusion: Further validation studies can be performed with these virtual faces among clinical populations known to present social cognition difficulties. Brain Computer Interface studies with feedback-feedforward interactions based on facial emotion expressions can also be conducted with these stimuli.

Evidence obtained from the intermittent hypoxia (IH) experimental model of SA has shown neuronal death, impairment in learning and memory and reactive gliosis that may account for cognitive and structural alterations observed in human patients. However, little is known about the mechanism controlling these deleterious effects that may be useful as therapeutic targets in SA. The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) and its downstream effector Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kappa B) have been related to neuronal death and astroglial conversion to the pro-inflammatory neurodegenerative phenotype. RAGE expression and its ligand S100B were shown to be increased in experimental models of SA. We here used dissociated mixed hippocampal cell cultures and male Wistar rats exposed to IH cycles and observed that NF-kappa B is activated in glial cells and neurons after IH. To disclose the relative contribution of the S100B/RAGE/NF-kappa B pathway to neuronal damage and reactive gliosis after IH we performed sequential loss of function studies using RAGE or S100B neutralizing antibodies, a herpes simplex virus (HSV)-derived amplicon vector that induces the expression of RAGE Delta cyto (dominant negative RAGE) and a chemical blocker of NF-kappa B. Our results show that NF-kappa B activation peaks 3 days after IH exposure, and that RAGE or NF-kappa B blockage during this critical period significantly improves neuronal survival and reduces reactive gliosis. Both in vitro and in vivo, S100B blockage altered reactive gliosis but did not have significant effects on neuronal survival. We conclude that both RAGE and downstream NF-kappa B signaling are centrally involved in the neuronal alterations found in SA models, and that blockage of these pathways is a tempting strategy for preventing neuronal degeneration and reactive gliosis in SA.

Objective: To assess narcolepsy risk following administration of a similar vaccine in Quebec. Design: Retrospective population-based study. Setting: Neurologists and lung specialists in the province were invited to report narcolepsy cases to a single reference centre. Population: Patients were interviewed by two sleep experts and standard diagnostic tests were performed. Immunization status was verified in the provincial pandemic influenza vaccination registry. Main Outcome Measures: Confirmed narcolepsy with or without cataplexy with onset of excessive daytime sleepiness between January 1 st, 2009, and December 31 st, 2010. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated using a Poisson model in a cohort analysis, by a self-controlled case series (SCCS) and a case-control method. Results: A total of 24 cases were included and overall incidence rate was 1.5 per million person-years. A cluster of 7 cases was observed among vaccinated persons in the winter 2009-2010. In the primary cohort analysis, 16-week post-vaccination RR was 4.32 (95% CI: 1.50-11.12). RR was 2.07 (0.70-6.17) in the SCCS, and 1.48 (0.37-7.03) using the case-control method. Estimates were lower when observation was restricted to the period of pandemic influenza circulation, and tended to be higher in persons,20 years old and for cataplexy cases. Conclusions: Results are compatible with an excess risk of approximately one case per million vaccine doses, mainly in persons less than 20 years of age. However, a confounding effect of the influenza infection cannot be ruled out.

EXPRESSION OF MU OPIOID RECEPTOR IN DORSAL DIENCEPHALIC CONDUCTION SYSTEM: NEW INSIGHTS FOR THE MEDIAL HABENULA	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						medial habenula; mu opioid receptor; knock-in mice; interpeduncular nucleus; substance P; acetylcholine	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; PRECIPITATED MORPHINE-WITHDRAWAL; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SUBSTANCE-P RELEASE; MICE LACKING; LATERAL HABENULA; IN-VIVO; INTERPEDUNCULAR NUCLEUS; KNOCKOUT MICE; GENE KNOCKOUT	The habenular complex, encompassing medial (MHb) and lateral (LHb) divisions, is a highly conserved epithalamic structure involved in the dorsal diencephalic conduction system (DDC). These brain nuclei regulate information flow between the limbic forebrain and the mid-and hindbrain, integrating cognitive with emotional and sensory processes. The MHb is also one of the strongest expression sites for mu opioid receptors (MORs), which mediate analgesic and rewarding properties of opiates. At present however, anatomical distribution and function of these receptors have been poorly studied in MHb pathways. Here we took advantage of a newly generated MOR-mcherry knock-in mouse line to characterize MOR expression sites in the DDC. MOR-mcherry fluorescent signal is weak in the LHb, but strong expression is visible in the MHb, fasciculus retroflexus (fr) and interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), indicating that MOR is mainly present in the MHb-IPN pathway. MOR-mcherry cell bodies are detected both in basolateral and apical parts of MHb, where the receptor co-localizes with cholinergic and substance P (SP) neurons, respectively, representing two main MHb neuronal populations. MOR-mcherry is expressed in most MHb-SP neurons, and is present in only a subpopulation of MHb-cholinergic neurons. Intense diffuse fluorescence detected in lateral and rostral parts of the IPN further suggests that MOR-mcherry is transported to terminals of these SP and cholinergic neurons. Finally, MOR-mcherry is present in septal regions projecting to the MHb, and in neurons of the central and intermediate IPN. Together, this study describes MOR expression in several compartments of the MHb-IPN circuitry. The remarkably high MOR density in the MHb-IPN pathway suggests that these receptors are in a unique position to mediate analgesic, autonomic and reward responses. (C) 2014 IBRO.

The methylated-DNA binding protein MBD2 enhances NGFI-A (egr-1)-mediated transcriptional activation of the glucocorticoid receptor	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						maternal care; glucocorticoid receptor; methyl-CpG binding domain protein-2; serotonin; NGFI-A; hippocampal neurons	HISTONE DEACETYLASE COMPLEX; MATERNAL-CARE; DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION; STRESS RESPONSES; THYROID-HORMONES; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; GENE-EXPRESSION; CPG ISLAND; SEROTONIN; DEMETHYLATION	Variations in maternal care in the rat influence the epigenetic state and transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene in the hippocampus. The mechanisms underlying this maternal effect remained to be defined, including the nature of the relevant maternally regulated intracellular signalling pathways. We show here that increased maternal licking/grooming (LG), which stably enhances hippocampal GR expression, paradoxically increases hippocampal expression of the methyl-CpG binding domain protein-2 (MBD2) and MBD2 binding to the exon 17 GR promoter. Knockdown experiments of MBD2 in hippocampal primary cell culture show that MBD2 is required for activation of exon 17 GR promoter. Ectopic co-expression of nerve growth factor-inducible protein A (NGFI-A) with MBD2 in HEK 293 cells with site-directed mutagenesis of the NGFI-A response element within the methylated exon 17 GR promoter supports the hypothesis that MBD2 collaborates with NGFI-A in binding and activation of this promoter. These data suggest a possible mechanism linking signalling pathways, which are activated by behavioural stimuli and activation of target genes.	[Weaver, Ian C.

We acquired high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans in 28 congenitally blind and 28 normal sighted subjects matched for age and gender. There was no overall group effect of visual deprivation on the total surface area of the corpus callosum. However, subdividing the corpus callosum into five subdivisions revealed significant regional changes in its three most posterior parts. Compared to the sighted controls, congenitally blind individuals showed a 12% reduction in the splenium, and a 20% increase in the isthmus and the posterior part of the body. A shape analysis further revealed that the bending angle of the corpus callosum was more convex in congenitally blind compared to the sighted control subjects. The observed morphometric changes in the corpus callosum are in line with the well-described cross-modal functional and structural neuroplastic changes in congenital blindness.

In line with these results, we recently showed that visual deprivation from birth leads to an increased sensitivity to pain. As many studies have shown that congenitally and late blind individuals show differences in their degree of compensatory plasticity, we here address the question whether late blind individuals also show hypersensitivity to nociceptive stimulation. We therefore compared pain thresholds and responses to supra-threshold nociceptive stimuli in congenitally blind, late blind and normally sighted volunteers. Participants also filled in questionnaires measuring attention and anxiety towards pain in everyday life. Results show that late blind participants have pain thresholds and ratings of supra-threshold heat nociceptive stimuli similar to the normally sighted, whereas congenitally blind participants are hypersensitive to nociceptive thermal stimuli. Furthermore, results of the pain questionnaires did not allow to discriminate late blind from normal sighted participants, whereas congenitally blind individuals had a different pattern of responses. Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced sensitivity to pain following visual deprivation is likely due to neuroplastic changes related to the early loss of vision.

Elevation and orientation of external loads influence trunk neuromuscular response and spinal forces despite identical moments at the L5-S1 level	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Spine; Load height; Load orientation; Finite element; Compression; Muscle forces	SURFACE EMG ELECTRODES; STATIC LIFTING TASKS; LUMBAR SPINE; MUSCLE-ACTIVITY; IN-VIVO; EXTENSOR MUSCLES; LOW-BACK; MODEL; STABILITY; BIOMECHANICS	A wide range of loading conditions involving external forces with varying magnitudes, orientations and locations are encountered in daily activities. Here we computed the effect on trunk biomechanics of changes in force location (two levels) and orientation (5 values) in 4 subjects in upright standing while maintaining identical external moment of 15 Nm, 30 N m or 45 Nm at the L5-S1. Driven by measured kinematics and gravity/external loads, the finite element models yielded substantially different trunk neuromuscular response with moderate alterations (up to 24% under 45 Nm moment) in spinal loads as the load orientation varied. Under identical moments, compression and shear forces at the L5-S1 as well as forces in extensor thoracic muscles progressively decreased as orientation of external forces varied from downward gravity (90) all the way to upward (-25 degrees) orientation. In contrast, forces in local lumbar muscles followed reverse trends. Under larger horizontal forces at a lower elevation, lumbar muscles were much more active whereas extensor thoracic muscle forces were greater under smaller forces at a higher elevation. Despite such differences in activity pattern, the spinal forces remained nearly identical (< 6% under 45 Nm moment). The published recorded surface EMG data of extensor muscles trend-wise agreed with computed local muscle forces as horizontal load elevation varied but were overall different from results in both local and global muscles when load orientation altered. Predictions demonstrate the marked effect of external force orientation and elevation on the trunk neuromuscular response and spinal forces and questions attempts to estimate spinal loads based only on consideration of moments at a spinal level.

The purpose of this study was to understand the existing health and community service needs and gaps in care and to use this information to develop a model to specify factors and processes that may improve the quality of care and health and well-being for persons with neurological conditions. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with health care professionals, community-based non-health care professionals working with individuals with neurological conditions, and policy makers -from the Ministries of Health, Community and Social Services, Transportation and Education- across Canada. We used a purposive sampling and snowballing approach to obtain maximum variation across professions, sector and geography (provinces and territories, rural and urban). Data analysis was an iterative, constant comparative process involving descriptive and interpretive analyses and was initially guided by the components of the Expanded Chronic Care Model. Results: A total of 180 individuals completed the interviews: 39% (n = 70) health care professionals, 47% (n = 85) community-based non-health care professionals, and 14% (n = 25) policy makers. Based on the data we developed the Chronic Care Model for Neurological Conditions (CCM-NC). The major needs/gaps are represented by the following themes: acceptance and openness to neurological conditions, evidence informed policy, investments and funding, supported transitions, caregiver support, and life enhancing resources (education, employment, housing and transportation), knowledge and awareness of neurological conditions and availability and access to health services. The model maintains that intersectoral collaboration across the health system, community and policy components is needed. It recognizes that attitudes, policies, enhanced community integration and health system changes are needed to develop activated patients and families, proactive service delivery teams, a person-centred health system and healthy public policy for persons with neurological conditions. Conclusion: The CCM-NC will generate debate and discussion about the actions needed in each of the model components to enable people with neurological conditions to sustain healthier lives. Next steps include validating the model with persons with neurological conditions, in and outside of the Canadian context and developing and evaluating interventions to test the model.

It remains to be determined, however, which patients are most likely to benefit from prophylactic LB use, and which LB design is optimal for this purpose. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different lumbar belts designs on range of motion and lumbopelvic rhythm. Methods: Healthy subjects (10 males; 10 females) performed five standing lumbar flexion/extension cycles, with knees straight, during a control (no belt) and four lumbar belt experimental conditions (extensible, with and without dorsal and ventral panels; non-extensible). Motion of the pelvis and lumbar spine was measured with 3D angular inertial sensors. Results: The results suggest that adding dorsal and ventral panels to an extensible LB produces the largest lumbar spine restrictions among the four tested lumbar belt designs, which in turn also altered the lumbopelvic rhythm. On a more exploratory basis, some sex differences were seen and the sex x experimental condition interaction just failed to reach significance. Conclusions: LB may provide some biomechanical benefit for patients with low back disorders, based on the protection that may be provided against soft tissue creep-based injury mechanisms. More comprehensive assessment of different LB designs, with additional psychological and neuromuscular measurement outcomes, however, must first be conducted in order to produce sound recommendations for LB use. Future research should also to take sex into account, with sufficient statistical power to clearly refute or confirm the observed trends.

This neuropathological trait was recently mimicked in a novel animal model of AD, the hemizygous transgenic McGill-R-Thy1-APP (Tg(+/-)) rat. The characterization of the behavioral phenotypes in this animal model could provide a baseline of efficacy for earlier therapeutic interventions. The aim of the present study was to undertake a longitudinal study of A beta accumulation and a comprehensive behavioral evaluation of this transgenic rat model. We assessed exploratory activity, anxiety-related behaviors, recognition memory, working memory, spatial learning and reference memory at 3, 6, and 12 months of age. In parallel, we measured A beta by ELISA, Western blots and semiguantitative immunohistochemistry in hippocampal samples. SDS-soluble A beta peptide accumulated at low levels (similar to 9 pg/mg) without differences among ages. However, Western blots showed SDS-resistant A beta oligomers (similar to 30 kDa) at 6 and 12 months, but not at 3 months. When compared to wild-type (WT), male Tg(+/-) rats exhibited a spatial reference memory deficit in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) as early as 3 months of age, which persisted at 6 and 12 months. In addition, Tg(+/-) rats displayed a working memory impairment in the Y-maze and higher anxiety levels in the Open Field (OF) at 6 and 12 months of age, but not at 3 months. Exploratory activity in the OF was similar to that of WT at all-time points. Spatial learning in the MWM and the recognition memory, as assessed by the Novel Object Recognition Test, were unimpaired at any time point. The data from the present study demonstrate that the hemizygous transgenic McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat has a wide array of behavioral and cognitive impairments from young adulthood to middle-age. The low A beta burden and early emotional and cognitive deficits in this transgenic rat model supports its potential use for drug discovery purposes in early AD.

Although deficiency of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase(BCKDC) and associated elevations in the BCAAs and their ketoacids have been recognized as the cause of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) for decades, treatment options for this disorder have been limited to dietary interventions. In recent years, the discovery of improved leucine tolerance after liver transplantation has resulted in a new therapeutic strategy for this disorder. Likewise, targeting the regulation of the BCKDC activity may be an alternative potential treatment strategy for MSUD. The regulation of the BCKDC by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase has also been implicated in a new inborn error of metabolism characterized by autism, intellectual disability and seizures. Finally, there is a growing body of literature implicating BCAA metabolism in more common disorders such as the metabolic syndrome, cancer and hepatic disease. This review surveys the knowledge acquired on the topic over the past 50 years and focuses on recent developments in the field of BCAA metabolism.	[Burrage, Lindsay C.; Nagamani, Sandesh C.

The unusual 2',5'-phosphodiester linkages in RNA lariats produced by the spliceosome must be hydrolyzed by the intron debranching enzyme (Dbr1) before they can be metabolized or processed into essential cellular factors, such as snoRNA and miRNA. Dbr1 is also involved in the propagation of retrotransposons and retroviruses, although the precise role played by the enzyme in these processes is poorly understood. Here, we report the first structures of Dbr1 alone and in complex with several synthetic RNA compounds that mimic the branchpoint in lariat RNA. The structures, together with functional data on Dbr1 variants, reveal the molecular basis for 2',5'-phosphodiester recognition and explain why the enzyme lacks activity toward 3',5'-phosphodiester linkages. The findings illuminate structure/function relationships in a unique enzyme that is central to eukaryotic RNA metabolism and set the stage for the rational design of inhibitors that may represent novel therapeutic agents to treat retroviral infections and neurodegenerative disease.

We investigated 44 children with unexplained IS using comparative genomic hybridisation arrays (aCGH) (n = 44) followed by targeted sequencing of 35 known epilepsy genes (n = 8) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) of familial trios (n = 18) to search for rare inherited or de novo mutations. aCGH analysis revealed de novo variants in 7% of patients (n = 3/44), including a distal 16p11.2 duplication, a 15q11.1q13.1 tetrasomy and a 2q21.3-q22.2 deletion. Furthermore, it identified a pathogenic maternally inherited Xp11.2 duplication. Targeted sequencing was informative for ARX(n = 1/14) and STXBP1(n = 1/8). In contrast, sequencing of a panel of 35 known epileptic encephalopathy genes(n = 8) did not identify further mutations. Finally, WES(n = 18) was very informative, with an excess of de novo mutations identified in genes predicted to be involved in neurodevelopmental processes and/or known to be intolerant to functional variations. Several pathogenic mutations were identified, including de novo mutations in STXBP1, CASK and ALG13, as well as recessive mutations in PNPO and ADSL, together explaining 28% of cases (5/18). In addition, WES identified 1-3 de novo variants in 64% of remaining probands, pointing to several interesting candidate genes. Our results indicate that IS are genetically heterogeneous with a major contribution of de novo mutations and that WES is significantly superior to targeted re-sequencing in identifying detrimental genetic variants involved in IS.

Minimizing Errors in Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury Trials by Acknowledging the Heterogeneity of Spinal Cord Anatomy and Injury Severity: An Observational Canadian Cohort Analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						bias; motor score; neurological recovery; spinal cord injury; statistical error	CLINICAL-TRIALS; ICCP PANEL; NEUROLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION; INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS; MOTOR RECOVERY; GUIDELINES; CONDUCT; MULTICENTER; NEUROPROTECTION; THERAPY	Clinical trials of therapies for acute traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) have failed to convincingly demonstrate efficacy in improving neurologic function. Failing to acknowledge the heterogeneity of these injuries and under-appreciating the impact of the most important baseline prognostic variables likely contributes to this translational failure. Our hypothesis was that neurological level and severity of initial injury (measured by the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS]) act jointly and are the major determinants of motor recovery. Our objective was to quantify the influence of these variables when considered together on early motor score recovery following acute tSCI. Eight hundred thirty-six participants from the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry were analyzed for motor score improvement from baseline to follow-up. In AIS A, B, and C patients, cervical and thoracic injuries displayed significantly different motor score recovery. AIS A patients with thoracic (T2-T10) and thoracolumbar (T11-L2) injuries had significantly different motor improvement. High (C1-C4) and low (C5-T1) cervical injuries demonstrated differences in upper extremity motor recovery in AIS B, C, and D. A hypothetical clinical trial example demonstrated the benefits of stratifying on neurological level and severity of injury. Clinically meaningful motor score recovery is predictably related to the neurological level of injury and the severity of the baseline neurological impairment. Stratifying clinical trial cohorts using a joint distribution of these two variables will enhance a study's chance of identifying a true treatment effect and minimize the risk of misattributed treatment effects. Clinical studies should stratify participants based on these factors and record the number of participants and their mean baseline motor scores for each category of this joint distribution as part of the reporting of participant characteristics. Improved clinical trial design is a high priority as new therapies and interventions for tSCI emerge.

Structural Basis for Substrate Specificity of Mammalian Neuraminidases	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SERUM SIALIC-ACID; SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; CYTOSOLIC SIALIDASE; LYSOSOMAL SIALIDASE; GANGLIOSIDE SIALIDASE; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; COLORECTAL-CANCER; MOLECULAR-CLONING; PROSTATE-CANCER; MUCOLIPIDOSIS-I	The removal of sialic acid (Sia) residues from glycoconjugates in vertebrates is mediated by a family of neuraminidases (sialidases) consisting of Neu1, Neu2, Neu3 and Neu4 enzymes. The enzymes play distinct physiological roles, but their ability to discriminate between the types of linkages connecting Sia and adjacent residues and between the identity and arrangement of the underlying sugars has never been systematically studied. Here we analyzed the specificity of neuraminidases by studying the kinetics of hydrolysis of BODIPY-labeled substrates containing common mammalian sialylated oligosaccharides: 3'Sia-LacNAc, 3'SiaLac, SiaLe(x), SiaLe(a), SiaLe(c), 6'SiaLac, and 6'SiaLacNAc. We found significant differences in substrate specificity of the enzymes towards the substrates containing alpha 2,6-linked Sia, which were readily cleaved by Neu3 and Neu1 but not by Neu4 and Neu2. The presence of a branching 2-Fuc inhibited Neu2 and Neu4, but had almost no effect on Neu1 or Neu3. The nature of the sugar residue at the reducing end, either glucose (Glc) or N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) had only a minor effect on all neuraminidases, whereas core structure (1,3 or 1,4 bond between D-galactose (Gal) and GlcNAc) was found to be important for Neu4 strongly preferring beta 3 (core 1) to beta 4 (core 2) isomer. Neu3 and Neu4 were in general more active than Neu1 and Neu2, likely due to their preference for hydrophobic substrates. Neu2 and Neu3 were examined by molecular dynamics to identify favorable substrate orientations in the binding sites and interpret the differences in their specificities. Finally, using knockout mouse models, we confirmed that the substrate specificities observed in vitro were recapitulated in enzymes found in mouse brain tissues. Our data for the first time provide evidence for the characteristic substrate preferences of neuraminidases and their ability to discriminate between distinct sialoside targets.

There are four isoforms of PP1 namely, PP1 alpha, PP1 beta/delta, PP1 gamma(1) and PP1 gamma(2). PP1 gamma and PP1 beta translocate to the nucleus by binding to a co-transporter that contains a nuclear localization signal. The mechanism by which PP1 alpha shuttles between the nucleus and the cytosol is not known. In this study, we found that PP1 alpha co-immunoprecipitates with 14-3-3 zeta; from HEK-293 cell lysates. By co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assay, we determined that 14-3-3 zeta; binds to both PP1 alpha (WT) and PP1 alpha (T320A), and that phosphorylation of PP1 alpha is not required for binding. Using PP1 alpha deletion mutants, we located the 14-3-3 zeta; binding region within PP1 alpha residues 159-279. An in vitro assay showed that 14-3-3 zeta; does not affect PP1 alpha activity. When HEK-293 cells expressing PP1 alpha and 14-3-3 zeta; were subjected to subcellular fractionation, the ratio of cytosolic vs. nuclear PP1 alpha was significantly higher in cells expressing PP1 alpha and 14-3-3 zeta; than those expressing PP1 alpha alone. In cells expressing a dominant negative 14-3-3 zeta; (K49E), PP1 alpha accumulated in the nucleus. Our results show that 14-3-3 zeta; binds to PP1 alpha and causes its retention in the cytosol which suggests that 14-3-3 zeta; regulates nuclear trafficking of PPla in mammalian cells.

After a threshold Ca2+ load, mitochondrial membrane potential drops and efflux of accumulated Ca2+ from the mitochondrial matrix occurs, indicating the mPTP opening. Specific antibodies were used to assess the role of the translocator protein (18 kDa; TSPO) and connexin43 in swelling of isolated rat liver and brain mitochondria induced by carbenoxolone and the endogenous TSPO ligand protoporphyrin IX. Mitochondrial membrane potential, Ca2+ transport and oxygen consumption were determined using selective electrodes. All the parameters were detected simultaneously in a chamber with the selective electrodes. The phosphorylation state of mitochondrial protein targets was assessed. We report that Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling was strengthened in the presence of both carbenoxolone and protoporphyrin IX. The carbenoxolone- and protoporphyrin IX-accelerated mPTP induction in brain mitochondria was completely prevented by antibodies specific for the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO). The anti-TSPO antibodies were more effective than anti-connexin43 antibodies. Moreover, carbenoxolone-stimulated phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins was inhibited by anti-TSPO antibodies. Taken together, the data suggests that, in addition to acting via connexion43, carbenoxolone may exert its effect on mPTP via mitochondrial outer membrane TSPO. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Mark			Quantifying blood-spinal cord barrier permeability after peripheral nerve injury in the living mouse	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article						Blood-spinal cord barrier permeability; Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI; Gd-DTPA; Mouse; Neuropathic pain; Peripheral nerve injury; Spinal cord	CONTRAST-ENHANCED MRI; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MICE; SYSTEM; SERIAL; MODEL	Background: Genetic polymorphisms, gender and age all influence the risk of developing chronic neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury (PNI). It is known that there are significant inter-strain differences in pain hypersensitivity in strains of mice after PNI. In response to PNI, one of the earliest events is thought to be the disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB). The study of BSCB integrity after PNI may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to chronic pain. Results: Here we used in vivo dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to establish a timecourse for BSCB permeability following PNI, produced by performing a spared nerve injury (SNI). From this longitudinal study, we found that the SNI group had a significant increase in BSCB permeability over time throughout the entire spinal cord. The BSCB opening had a delayed onset and the increase in permeability was transient, returning to control levels just over one day after the surgery. We also examined inter-strain differences in BSCB permeability using five mouse strains (B10, C57BL/6J, CD-1, A/J and BALB/c) that spanned the range of pain hypersensitivity. We found a significant increase in BSCB permeability in the SNI group that was dependent on strain but that did not correlate with the reported strain differences in PNI-induced tactile hypersensitivity. These results were consistent with a previous experiment using Evans Blue dye to independently assess the status of the BSCB permeability. Conclusions: DCE-MRI provides a sensitive and non-invasive method to follow BSCB permeability in the same group of mice over time. Examining differences between mouse strains, we demonstrated that there is an important genetically-based control of the PNI-induced increase in BSCB permeability and that the critical genetic determinants of BSCB opening after PNI are distinct from those that determine genetic variability in PNI-induced pain hypersensitivity.

The ability to activate compensatory mechanisms in response to environmental stress is an important factor for survival and maintenance of cellular functions. Autophagy is activated both under short and prolonged stress and is required to clear the cell of dysfunctional organelles and altered proteins. We report that specific autophagy inhibition in muscle has a major impact on neuromuscular synaptic function and, consequently, on muscle strength, ultimately affecting the lifespan of animals. Inhibition of autophagy also exacerbates aging phenotypes in muscle, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and profound weakness. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress directly affect acto-myosin interaction and force generation but show a limited effect on stability of neuromuscular synapses. These results demonstrate that age-related deterioration of synaptic structure and function is exacerbated by defective autophagy.

Allele-Specific Suppression of Mutant Huntingtin Using Antisense Oligonucleotides: Providing a Therapeutic Option for All Huntington Disease Patients	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; SELECTIVE INHIBITION; CAG REPEATS; MOUSE MODEL; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; EMBRYONIC LETHALITY; ATAXIN-3 EXPRESSION; RNA INTERFERENCE; GENE HOMOLOG; NUCLEIC-ACID	Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. The mutant protein causes neuronal dysfunction and degeneration resulting in motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disturbances. Currently, there is no disease altering treatment, and symptomatic therapy has limited benefit. The pathogenesis of HD is complicated and multiple pathways are compromised. Addressing the problem at its genetic root by suppressing mutant huntingtin expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for HD. We have developed and evaluated antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly enriched on HD alleles (HD-SNPs). We describe our structure-activity relationship studies for ASO design and find that adjusting the SNP position within the gap, chemical modifications of the wings, and shortening the unmodified gap are critical for potent, specific, and well tolerated silencing of mutant huntingtin. Finally, we show that using two distinct ASO drugs targeting the two allelic variants of an HD-SNP could provide a therapeutic option for all persons with HD; allele-specifically for roughly half, and non-specifically for the remainder.

Design Case-control study. Setting The Quebec health insurance program database (RAMQ). Participants 1796 people with a first diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and followed up for at least six years before were matched with 7184 controls on sex, age group, and duration of follow-up. Both groups were randomly sampled from older people (age >66) living in the community in 2000-09. Main outcome measure The association between Alzheimer's disease and benzodiazepine use started at least five years before diagnosis was assessed by using multivariable conditional logistic regression. Ever exposure to benzodiazepines was first considered and then categorised according to the cumulative dose expressed as prescribed daily doses (1-90, 91-180, >180) and the drug elimination half life. Results Benzodiazepine ever use was associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (adjusted odds ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 1.69; further adjustment on anxiety, depression, and insomnia did not markedly alter this result: 1.43, 1.28 to 1.60). No association was found for a cumulative dose <91 prescribed daily doses. The strength of association increased with exposure density (1.32 (1.01 to 1.74) for 91-180 prescribed daily doses and 1.84 (1.62 to 2.08) for >180 prescribed daily doses) and with the drug half life (1.43 (1.27 to 1.61) for short acting drugs and 1.70 (1.46 to 1.98) for long acting ones). Conclusion Benzodiazepine use is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The stronger association observed for long term exposures reinforces the suspicion of a possible direct association, even if benzodiazepine use might also be an early marker of a condition associated with an increased risk of dementia. Unwarranted long term use of these drugs should be considered as a public health concern.

J	Hawco, C; Lepage, M				Hawco, Colin; Lepage, Martin			Overlapping patterns of neural activity for different forms of novelty in fMRI	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						repetition suppression; novelty; fMRI; semantic; priming	REPETITION SUPPRESSION; MEMORY; CORTEX; MECHANISMS	When stimuli are presented multiple times, the neural response to repeated stimuli is reduced relative to novel stimuli (repetition suppression). Responses to different types of novelty were examined. Stimulus novelty was examined by contrasting first vs. second presentation of triads of objects during memory encoding. Semantic novelty was contrasted by comparing unrelated (semantically novel) triads of objects to triads in which all three objects were related (e.g., all objects were tools). In recognition, associative novelty was examined by contrasting rearranged triads (previously seen objects in a new association) with intact triads. Activity was observed in posterior regions (occipital and fusiform), with the largest extent of activity for stimulus novelty and smallest for associational novelty. Frontal activity was also observed in stimulus and semantic novelty. Additional analysis indicated that the hemodynamic response in voxels identified in the stimulus and semantic novelty contrasts was modulated by reaction time on a trial-by-trial basis. That is, the duration of the hemodynamic response was driven by reaction time. This was not the case for associative novelty. The high level of overlap across different forms of novelty suggests a similar mechanism for reduced neural activity, which may be related to reduced visual processing time This is consistent with a facilitation model of repetition suppression, which posits a reduced peak and duration of neuronal firing for repeated stimuli	[Hawco, Colin] Univ Toronto, Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Temerty Ctr Therapeut Brain Stimulat, Toronto, ON M6J 1H4, Canada; [Lepage, Martin] McGill Univ, Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada	Hawco, C (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Temerty Ctr Therapeut Brain Stimulat, Unit 4-1,Off 125,1001 Queen St West, Toronto, ON M6J 1H4, Canada.	colin.hawco@camh.ca			National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [238617]	This study was funded by grant number 238617 from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.		22	3	3	1	7	FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION	LAUSANNE	PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND	1662-5161			FRONT HUM NEUROSCI	Front.

Longitudinal evaluation of the metabolic response of a tumor xenograft model to single fraction radiation therapy using magnetic resonance spectroscopy	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						magnetic resonance spectroscopy; tumour xenograft; radiation therapy; therapeutic response monitoring	PROTON MR SPECTROSCOPY; 9.4 T; MOUSE MODEL; SHIM COILS; CANCER; BRAIN; SUSCEPTIBILITY; ADC; METASTASES; LYMPHOMA	Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to evaluate the metabolic profile of human glioblastoma multiform brain tumors grown as xenografts in nude mice before, and at multiple time points after single fraction radiation therapy. Tumors were grown over the thigh in 16 mice in this study, of which 5 served as untreated controls and 11 had their tumors treated to 800 cGy with 200 kVp x-rays. Spectra were acquired within 24 h pre-treatment, and then at 3, 7 and 14 d post-treatment using a 9.4 T animal magnetic resonance (MR) system. For the untreated control tumors, spectra (1-2 per mouse) were acquired at different stages of tumor growth. Spectra were obtained with the PRESS pulse sequence using a 3 x 3 x 3 mm(3) voxel. Analysis was performed with the LCModel software platform. Six metabolites were profiled for this analysis: alanine (Ala), myo-inositol (Ins), taurine (Tau), creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr + PCr), glutamine and glutamate (Glu + Gln), and total choline (glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine) (GPC + PCh). For the treated cohort, most metabolite/water concentration ratios were found to decrease in the short term at 3 and 7 d post-treatment, followed by an increase at 14 d post-treatment toward pre-treatment values. The lowest concentrations were observed at 7 d post-treatment, with magnitudes (relative to pre-treatment concentration ratios) of: 0.42 +/- 24.6% (Ala), 0.43 +/- 15.3% (Ins), 0.68 +/- 27.9% (Tau), 0.52 +/- 14.6% (GPC + PCh), 0.49 +/- 21.0% (Cr + PCr) and 0.78 +/- 24.5% (Glu + Gln). Control animals did not demonstrate any significant correlation between tumor volume and metabolite concentration, indicating that the observed kinetics were the result of the therapeutic intervention. We have demonstrated the feasibility of using MRS to follow multiple metabolic markers over time for the purpose of evaluating therapeutic response of tumors to radiation therapy. This study provides supporting evidence that metabolite/water concentration ratios have the potential to be used as biomarkers for the assessment of the response to therapy.	[Tessier, A.

There is now considerable evidence indicating that reduced inhibition in the spinal dorsal horn contributes to neuropathic pain. A loss of these inhibitory neurons after nerve injury is one of the mechanisms being proposed to account for reduced inhibition; however, this remains controversial. This is in part because previous studies have focused on global measurements of inhibitory neurons without assessing the number of inhibitory synapses. To address this, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the spatial and temporal changes in the number of inhibitory terminals, as detected by glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) immunoreactivity, in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord following a chronic constriction injury (CCI) to the sciatic nerve in rats. Isolectin B4 (IB4) labelling was used to define the location within the dorsal horn directly affected by the injury to the peripheral nerve. The density of GAD65 inhibitory terminals was reduced in lamina I (LI) and lamina II (LII) of the spinal cord after injury. The loss of GAD65 terminals was greatest in LII with the highest drop occurring around 3-4 weeks and a partial recovery by 56 days. The time course of changes in the number of GAD65 terminals correlated well with both the loss of IB4 labeling and with the altered thresholds to mechanical and thermal stimuli. Our detailed analysis of GAD65+ inhibitory terminals clearly revealed that nerve injury induced a transient loss of GAD65 immunoreactive terminals and suggests a potential involvement for these alterations in the development and amelioration of pain behaviour.

Previous studies have indicated that the H/O neuronal development differs between mammals and fish; H/O peptide-expressing cells are detectable during the earliest stages of brain morphogenesis in fish, but only towards the end of brain morphogenesis (by similar to 85% of embryonic development) in rats. The developmental emergence of H/O neurons has never been previously described in birds. With the goal of determining whether the chick developmental pattern was more similar to that of mammals or of fish, we investigated the emergence of H/O-expressing cells in the brain of chick embryos of different ages using immunohistochemistry. Post-natal chick brains were included in order to compare the spatial distribution of H/O cells with that of other vertebrates. We found that H/O-expressing cells appear to originate from two separate places in the region of the diencephalic proliferative zone. These developing cells express the H/O neuropeptide at a comparatively early age relative to rodents (already visible at 14% of the way through fetal development), thus bearing a closer resemblance to fish. The H/O-expressing cell population proliferates to a large number of cells by a relatively early embryonic age. As previously suggested, the distribution of H/O neurons is intermediate between that of mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. This work suggests that, in addition to its roles in developed brains, the H/O peptide may play an important role in the early embryonic development of non-mammalian vertebrates.

Responses to contrast modulation (CM) and other second-order stimuli have been extensively studied in human psychophysics, but the neuronal substrates of second-order responses in nonhuman primates remain poorly understood. In this study, we have recorded single neurons in area V2 of macaque monkeys, using both CM patterns as well as conventional luminance modulation (LM) gratings. CM stimuli were constructed from stationary sine wave grating carrier patterns, which were modulated by drifting envelope gratings of a lower spatial frequency. We found approximately one-third of visually responsive V2 neurons responded to CM stimuli with a pronounced selectivity to carrier spatial frequencies, and often orientations, that were clearly outside the neurons' passbands for LM gratings. These neurons were "form-cue invariant" in that their tuning to CM envelope spatial frequency and orientation was very similar to that for LM gratings. Neurons were tuned to carrier spatial frequencies that were typically 2-4 octaves higher than their optimal envelope spatial frequencies, similar to results from human psychophysics. These results are distinct from CM responses arising from surround suppression, but could be understood in terms of a filter-rectify-filter model. Such neurons could provide a functionally useful and explicit representation of segmentation boundaries as well as a plausible neural substrate for human perception of second-order boundaries.

At the cellular level, ALS neurons show protein misfolding and aggregation phenotypes. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has recently been shown to be associated with ALS, but the early pathophysiological deficits causing impairment in motor function are unknown. Here we used Caenorhabditis elegans expressing mutant TDP-43(A315T) in motor neurons and explored the potential influences of calcium (Ca2+). Using chemical and genetic approaches to manipulate the release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores, we observed that the reduction of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) rescued age-dependent paralysis and prevented the neurodegeneration of GABAergic motor neurons. Our data implicate elevated [Ca2+](i) as a driver of TDP-43-mediated neuronal toxicity. Furthermore, we discovered that neuronal degeneration is independent of the executioner caspase CED-3, but instead requires the activity of the Ca2+-regulated calpain protease TRA-3, and the aspartyl protease ASP-4. Finally, chemically blocking protease activity protected against mutant TDP-43(A315T)-associated neuronal toxicity. This work both underscores the potential of the C. elegans system to identify key targets for therapeutic intervention and suggests that a focused effort to regulate ER Ca2+ release and necrosis-like degeneration consequent to neuronal injury may be of clinical importance.

In this article, we present and evaluate a computational approach for measuring the degree to which these interactions exist in a given performance. We recorded a number of string quartet exercises under two experimental conditions (solo and ensemble), acquiring both audio and bowing motion data. Numerical features in the form of time series were extracted from the data as performance descriptors representative of four distinct dimensions of the performance: Intonation, Dynamics, Timbre, and Tempo. Four different interdependence estimation methods (two linear and two nonlinear) were applied to the extracted features in order to assess the overall level of interdependence between the four musicians. The obtained results suggest that it is possible to correctly discriminate between the two experimental conditions by quantifying interdependence between the musicians in each of the studied performance dimensions; the nonlinear methods appear to perform best for most of the numerical features tested. Moreover, by using the solo recordings as a reference to which the ensemble recordings are contrasted, it is feasible to compare the amount of interdependence that is established between the musicians in a given performance dimension across all exercises, and relate the results to the underlying goal of the exercise. We discuss our findings in the context of ensemble performance research, the current limitations of our approach, and the ways in which it can be expanded and consolidated.

We have developed a procedure to study the behavioral and neural processes that mediate the impact of context on alcohol-seeking behavior in rats. Following acclimation to the taste and pharmacological effects of 15% ethanol in the home cage, male Long-Evans rats receive Pavlovian discrimination training (PDT) in conditioning chambers. In each daily (Mon-Fri) PDT session, 16 trials each of two different 10 sec auditory conditioned stimuli occur. During one stimulus, the CS+, 0.2 ml of 15% ethanol is delivered into a fluid port for oral consumption. The second stimulus, the CS-, is not paired with ethanol. Across sessions, entries into the fluid port during the CS+ increase, whereas entries during the CS- stabilize at a lower level, indicating that a predictive association between the CS+ and ethanol is acquired. During PDT each chamber is equipped with a specific configuration of visual, olfactory and tactile contextual stimuli. Following PDT, extinction training is conducted in the same chamber that is now equipped with a different configuration of contextual stimuli. The CS+ and CS- are presented as before, but ethanol is withheld, which causes a gradual decline in port entries during the CS+. At test, rats are placed back into the PDT context and presented with the CS+ and CS- as before, but without ethanol. This manipulation triggers a robust and selective increase in the number of port entries made during the alcohol predictive CS+, with no change in responding during the CS-. This effect, referred to as context-induced renewal, illustrates the powerful capacity of contexts associated with alcohol consumption to stimulate alcohol-seeking behavior in response to Pavlovian alcohol cues.

This protocol describes a technique where mitochondria isolated from rodent tissue are immunolabeled and analyzed by flow cytometry. Mitochondria are isolated from rodent spinal cords and subjected to a rapid enrichment step so as to remove myelin, a major contaminant of mitochondrial fractions prepared from nervous tissue. Isolated mitochondria are then labeled with an antibody of choice and a fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody. Analysis by flow cytometry verifies the relative purity of mitochondrial preparations by staining with a mitochondrial specific dye, followed by detection and quantification of immunolabeled protein. This technique is rapid, quantifiable and high-throughput, allowing for the analysis of hundreds of thousands of mitochondria per sample. It is applicable to assess novel proteins at the mitochondrial surface under normal physiological conditions as well as the proteins that may become mislocalized to this organelle during pathology. Importantly, this method can be coupled to fluorescent indicator dyes to report on certain activities of mitochondrial subpopulations and is feasible for mitochondria from the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) as well as liver.

They are considered the safest method of transporting oil and gas because of their limited number of failures. However, pipelines are subject to deterioration and degradation. It is therefore important that pipelines be effectively monitored to optimize their operation and to reduce their failures to an acceptable safety limit. Numerous models have been developed recently to predict pipeline conditions. Nevertheless, most of these models have used corrosion features alone to assess the condition of pipelines. Hence, this paper presents the development of models that evaluate and predict the condition of offshore oil and gas pipelines based on several factors besides corrosion. The models were developed using artificial neural network (ANN) technique based on historical inspection data collected from three existing offshore oil and gas pipelines in Qatar. The models were able to successfully predict pipeline conditions with an average percent validity above 97% when applied to the validation data set. The models are expected to help pipeline operators to assess and predict the condition of existing oil and gas pipelines and hence prioritize the planning of their inspection and rehabilitation.

To date, six novel tau imaging agents [F-18]THK523, [F-18]THK5105, [F-18]THK5117, [F-18] T807, [F-18]T808, and [C-11]PBB3-have been described and are considered promising as potential tau radioligands. Tau imaging agents offer the opportunity of in vivo topographical mapping and quantification of tau aggregates in parallel with clinical and cognitive assessments. As such, tau imaging is considered of key importance for progress toward earlier and more accurate diagnosis of tauopathies as well as for the monitoring of therapeutic interventions and drug development. Here, we shed light on the most important developments in tau radiopharmaceuticals, highlighting challenges, possibilities and future directions.

Primary and secondary end points: To assess the change from baseline in the frequency of cervicogenic headache days per 28-day period between placebo and treatment group. To assess the change from baseline in the intensity of headache, and health outcome measures. Study design: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in patients with cervicogenic headache. Procedures: The study consisted of two phases. A baseline of -28 days and a double-blind placebo-controlled phase: with an escalation and maintenance phase, during which patients remained at their highest dose until the end of the study, at Day 86. Results: Forty one patients were randomized, predominantly females, with a mean age of 52 years old. At screening, both groups had, on average, 26 headache-days per month. By the final phase of the study, the number of headache days dropped to 16 per month for the pregabalin group while remaining stable for the placebo group (p = 0.037). No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Conclusion: In this study, primary objectives were achieved with a statistically significant change of ten days in frequency of headache days; with minor side effects that were well tolerated.

MAVAN Res Team	The Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment Project: Theory and Methodology	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PSYCHIATRIE			English	Review						child development; longitudinal; early adversity; maternal sensitivity; attachment; gene-environment interactions	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; YOUNG CHILDRENS DEVELOPMENT; DIFFERENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY; STRESS REACTIVITY; FOLLOW-UP; BEHAVIOR QUESTIONNAIRE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; INFANT ATTACHMENT	Objective: To describe the theory and methodology of the multi-wave, prospective Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) study. The goal of MAVAN is to examine the pre-and postnatal influences, and their interaction, in determining individual differences in mental health. Method: MAVAN is a community-based, birth cohort study of pregnant Canadian mothers and their offspring. Dyads are assessed longitudinally, with multiple assessments of both mother and child in home and laboratory across the child's development. Study measures, including assessments of cognitive and emotional function, are described. The study uses a candidate gene approach to examine gene-environment interdependence in specific developmental outcomes. Finally, the study includes measures of both brain-based phenotypes and metabolism to explore comorbidities associated with child obesity. One of the unique features of the MAVAN protocol is the extensive measures of the mother-child interaction. The relation between these measures will be discussed. Results: Evidence from the MAVAN project shows interesting results about maternal care, families, and child outcomes. In our review, preliminary analyses showing the correlations between measures of maternal care are reported. As predicted, early evidence suggests that maternal care measures are positively correlated, over time. Conclusions: This review provides evidence for the feasibility and value of laboratory-based measures embedded within a longitudinal birth cohort study. Though retention of the samples has been a challenge of MAVAN, they are within a comparable range to other studies of this nature. Indeed, the trade-off of somewhat greater participant burden has allowed for a rich database. The results yielded from the MAVAN project will not only describe typical development but also possible targets for intervention. Understanding certain endophenotypes will shed light on the pathogenesis of various mental and physical disorders, as well as their interrelation.

Few studies have assessed whether ELF in different time windows of exposure maybe associated with specific histologic types of brain tumors. This study examines the association between ELF and brain tumors in the large-scale INTEROCC study. Methods: Cases of adult primary glioma and meningioma were recruited in seven countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) between 2000 and 2004. Estimates of mean workday ELF exposure based on a job exposure matrix were assigned. Estimates of cumulative exposure, average exposure, maximum exposure, and exposure duration were calculated for the lifetime, and 1 to 4, 5 to 9, and 10+ years before the diagnosis/reference date. Results: There were 3,761 included brain tumor cases (1,939 glioma and 1,822 meningioma) and 5,404 population controls. There was no association between lifetime cumulative ELF exposure and glioma or meningioma risk. However, there were positive associations between cumulative ELF 1 to 4 years before the diagnosis/reference date and glioma [odds ratio (OR) >= 90th percentile vs. < 25th percentile, 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.36-2.07; P-Linear (trend) < 0.0001], and, somewhat weaker associations with meningioma (OR >= 90th percentile vs. < 25th percentile, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.97-1.57; P-Linear trend = 0.02). Conclusions: Results showed positive associations between ELF in the recent past and glioma. Impact: Occupational ELF exposure may play a role in the later stages (promotion and progression) of brain tumorigenesis. (C)2014 AACR.

However, the literature remains somewhat ambiguous with respect to which distinct cognitive functions are the most impaired in cocaine use disorder and to how duration of abstinence affects cognitive recovery. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the cognitive domains impaired in cocaine abuse/dependence and the duration of abstinence necessary to achieve cognitive recovery. Methods: A literature search yielded 46 studies that assessed cognitive dysfunction in subjects with cocaine abuse/dependence. Effect-size estimates were calculated using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V2, for the following 11 cognitive domains: attention, executive functions, impulsivity, speed of processing, verbal fluency/language, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, visuospatial abilities, and working memory. Within these 11 domains, effect-size estimates were calculated on the basis of abstinence duration: short- (positive for drugs urine screening), intermediate- (<= 12 weeks), and long-term (>= 20 weeks) abstinence. Results: Findings revealed moderate impairment across 8 cognitive domains during intermediate abstinence. The most impaired domains were attention, impulsivity, verbal learning/memory, and working memory. For some domains (attention, speed of processing, and verbal learning/memory), impairments were smaller during short-term abstinence than during intermediate abstinence. Finally, small effect-size estimates were found for long-term abstinence. Discussion: These results suggest significant impairment across multiple cognitive domains in cocaine abusers, and that some of these deficits may be partially masked by the residual or acute withdrawal effects of cocaine. Cognitive dysfunctions remain stable during the first months of abstinence and may abate after 5 months of sobriety.

ATLAS Collaboration	A neural network clustering algorithm for the ATLAS silicon pixel detector	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Particle tracking detectors; Particle tracking detectors (Solid-state detectors)		A novel technique to identify and split clusters created by multiple charged particles in the ATLAS pixel detector using a set of artificial neural networks is presented. Such merged clusters are a common feature of tracks originating from highly energetic objects, such as jets. Neural networks are trained using Monte Carlo samples produced with a detailed detector simulation. This technique replaces the former clustering approach based on a connected component analysis and charge interpolation. The performance of the neural network splitting technique is quantified using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and from Monte Carlo simulations. This technique reduces the number of clusters shared between tracks in highly energetic jets by up to a factor of three. It also provides more precise position and error estimates of the clusters in both the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution.	[Jackson, P.; Soni, N.; White, M.

Objectives: To evaluate and identify the determinants of the KAB of primary care physicians and pharmacists, and to document clinician preferences regarding the content and format of a continuing education program (CEP). Method: Physicians and pharmacists of 486 CNCP patients participated. Physicians completed the original version of the KnowPain-50 questionnaire. Pharmacists completed a modified version. A multivariate linear regression model was developed to identify the determinants of their KAB. Results : A total of 137 of 387 (35.4%) physicians and 110 of 278 (39.5%) pharmacists completed the survey. Compared with the physicians, the pharmacists surveyed included more women (64% versus 38%) and had less clinical experience (15 years versus 26 years). The mean KnowPain-50 score was 69.3% (95% CI 68.0% to 70.5%) for physicians and 63.8% (95% CI 62.5% to 65.1%) for pharmacists. Low scores were observed on all aspects of pain management: initial assessment (physicians, 68.3%; pharmacists, 65.4%); definition of treatment goals and expectations (76.1%; 61.6%); development of a treatment plan (66.4%; 59.0%); and reassessment and management of longitudinal care (64.3%; 53.1%). Ten hours of reported CEP sessions increased the KAB score by 0.3 points. All clinicians considered a CEP for CNCP to be essential. Physicians preferred an interactive format, while pharmacists had no clear preferences. Conclusion: A CEP to improve primary care providers' knowledge and competency in managing CNCP, and to reduce false beliefs and inappropriate attitudes regarding CNCP is relevant and perceived as necessary by clinicians.

J	Steinhauer, K				Steinhauer, Karsten			Event-related Potentials (ERPs) in Second Language Research: A Brief Introduction to the Technique, a Selected Review, and an Invitation to Reconsider Critical Periods in L2	APPLIED LINGUISTICS			English	Article							AGE-OF-ONSET; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; LANGUAGE; ACQUISITION; SYNTAX; SENSITIVITY; LEARNERS; CONSTRAINTS; HYPOTHESIS	This article provides a selective overview of recent event-related brain potential (ERP) studies in L2 morpho-syntax, demonstrating that the ERP evidence supporting the critical period hypothesis (CPH) may be less compelling than previously thought. The article starts with a general introduction to ERP methodology and language-related ERP profiles in native speakers. The second section presents early ERP studies supporting the CPH, discusses some of their methodological problems, and follows up with data from more recent studies avoiding these problems. It is concluded that well-controlled ERP studies support the convergence hypothesis, according to which L2 learners initially differ from native speakers and then converge on native-like neurocognitive processing mechanisms. The fact that ERPs in late L2 learners at high levels of proficiency are often indistinguishable from those of native speakers suggests that age-of-acquisition effects in SLA are not primarily driven by maturational constraints.

In patients with pure Lewy body Parkinson's disease, previous post-mortem studies have shown that dopaminergic and cholinergic regulatory projection systems degenerate, but the exact pathways that may explain the development of dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease remain unclear. Studies in rodents suggest that both the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic and septohippocampal cholinergic pathways may functionally interact to regulate certain aspects of cognition, however, whether such an interaction occurs in humans is still poorly understood. In this study, we performed stereological analyses of the A9 and A10 dopaminergic neurons and Ch1, Ch2 and Ch4 cholinergic neurons located in the basal forebrain, along with an assessment of alpha-synuclein pathology in these regions and in the hippocampus of six demented and five non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease and five age-matched control individuals with no signs of neurological disease. Moreover, we measured choline acetyltransferase activity in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of eight demented and eight non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease, as well as in the same areas of eight age-matched controls. All patients with Parkinson's disease exhibited a similar 80-85% loss of pigmented A9 dopaminergic neurons, whereas patients with Parkinson's disease dementia presented an additional loss in the lateral part of A10 dopaminergic neurons as well as Ch4 nucleus basalis neurons. In contrast, medial A10 dopaminergic neurons and Ch1 and Ch2 cholinergic septal neurons were largely spared. Despite variable Ch4 cell loss, cortical but not hippocampal cholinergic activity was consistently reduced in all patients with Parkinson's disease, suggesting significant dysfunction in cortical cholinergic pathways before frank neuronal degeneration. Patients with Parkinson's disease dementia were differentiated by a significant reduction in hippocampal cholinergic activity, by a significant loss of non-pigmented lateral A10 dopaminergic neurons and Ch4 cholinergic neurons (30 and 55% cell loss, respectively, compared with neuronal preservation in control subjects), and by an increase in the severity of alpha-synuclein pathology in the basal forebrain and hippocampus. Overall, these results point to increasing alpha-synuclein deposition and hippocampal dysfunction in a setting of more widespread degeneration of cortical dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways as contributing to the dementia occurring in patients with pure Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, our findings support the concept that alpha-synuclein deposition is associated with significant neuronal dysfunction in the absence of frank neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease.

In our view, their results depend on a number of assumptions and subjective decisions that, at best, allow for different interpretations. We also had a unique role in the review process of their paper prior to its publication when we were invited to write a Preview. We detail that role here and describe how non-transparent editorial decision-making rejected our Preview and allowed publication despite our major concerns. The main purpose of this report is to invite Hampshire and colleagues to respond to our specific scientific concerns that aim to clarify their work and contribute a constructive discussion about the meaning of their findings.

Failure to cite relevant papers, poor sampling and restricted ranges also remain problematic for the definitive conclusions they drew. The editorial review process for investigating the serious issues we raised prior to publication in Neuron remains a mystery. We stand by the opinion expressed in our preview: the Hampshire et al. paper is an interesting but flawed exercise and their conclusions are not as definitive, or original, as they believe.

Psychiatric diagnosis was obtained by means of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. A statistically significant association was found between some psychiatric disorders and specific groups of crime: lifelong substance addiction with sex crimes and homicide; antisocial personality disorder with robbery and with kidnapping and extortion; borderline personality disorder with sex crimes; and lifelong alcohol addiction with fraud and conspiracy and with armed robbery and murder. It was concluded that the mental disorders considered more severe (psychosis and bipolar disorder) were not associated with violent crimes, suggesting that the severity of the psychotic disorder may be the factor that has caused psychosis to be associated with violent crimes in previous studies.

The complexity of the system is puzzling, however in many instances, tissues express multiple ephrins and Ephs on both sides of the boundary, a situation that should in principle cause repulsion between cells within each tissue. Although co-expression of ephrins and Eph receptors is widespread in embryonic tissues, neurons, and cancer cells, it is still unresolved how the respective signals are integrated into a coherent output. We present a simple explanation for the confinement of repulsion to the tissue interface: Using the dorsal ectoderm-mesoderm boundary of the Xenopus embryo as a model, we identify selective functional interactions between ephrin-Eph pairs that are expressed in partial complementary patterns. The combined repulsive signals add up to be strongest across the boundary, where they reach sufficient intensity to trigger cell detachments. The process can be largely explained using a simple model based exclusively on relative ephrin and Eph concentrations and binding affinities. We generalize these findings for the ventral ectoderm-mesoderm boundary and the notochord boundary, both of which appear to function on the same principles. These results provide a paradigm for how developmental systems may integrate multiple cues to generate discrete local outcomes.

In neurons, SHANK2 and SHANK3 have a positive effect on the induction and maturation of dendritic spines, whereas SHANK1 induces the enlargement of spine heads. Mutations in SHANK genes have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but their prevalence and clinical relevance remain to be determined. Here, we performed a new screen and a meta-analysis of SHANK copy-number and coding-sequence variants in ASD. Copy-number variants were analyzed in 5,657 patients and 19,163 controls, coding-sequence variants were ascertained in 760 to 2,147 patients and 492 to 1,090 controls (depending on the gene), and, individuals carrying de novo or truncating SHANK mutations underwent an extensive clinical investigation. Copy-number variants and truncating mutations in SHANK genes were present in similar to 1% of patients with ASD: mutations in SHANK1 were rare (0.04%) and present in males with normal IQ and autism; mutations in SHANK2 were present in 0.17% of patients with ASD and mild intellectual disability; mutations in SHANK3 were present in 0.69% of patients with ASD and up to 2.12% of the cases with moderate to profound intellectual disability. In summary, mutations of the SHANK genes were detected in the whole spectrum of autism with a gradient of severity in cognitive impairment. Given the rare frequency of SHANK1 and SHANK2 deleterious mutations, the clinical relevance of these genes remains to be ascertained. In contrast, the frequency and the penetrance of SHANK3 mutations in individuals with ASD and intellectual disability-more than 1 in 50-warrant its consideration for mutation screening in clinical practice.

Pathophysiology of brain dysfunction in hyperammonemic syndromes: The many faces of glutamine	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Glutamine; Ammonia; Urea cycle enzymopathies; Hepatic encephalopathy; Alzheimer type 2 astrocytosis; Brain edema	ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; ORNITHINE TRANSCARBAMYLASE DEFICIENCY; MITOCHONDRIAL PERMEABILITY TRANSITION; PORTACAVAL ANASTOMOSIS; HEPATIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY; ALPHA-KETOGLUTARAMATE; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; RAT ASTROCYTES; AMMONIA; EDEMA	Ineffective hepatic clearance of excess ammonia in the form of urea, as occurs in urea cycle enzymopathies (UCDs) and in liver failure, leads to increases in circulating and tissue concentrations of glutamine and a positive correlation between brain glutamine and the severity of neurological symptoms. Studies using 1H/13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy reveal increased de novo synthesis of glutamine in the brain in acute liver failure (ALF) but increases of synthesis rates per se do not correlate with either the severity of encephalopathy or brain edema Skeletal muscle becomes primarily responsible for removal of excess ammonia in liver failure and in UCDs, an adaptation that results from a post-translational induction of the glutamine synthetase (GS) gene. The importance of muscle in ammonia removal in hyperammonemia accounts for the resurgence of interest in maintaining adequate dietary protein and the use of agents aimed at the stimulation of muscle GS. Alternative or additional metabolic and regulatory pathways that impact on brain glutamine homeostasis in hyperammonemia include (i) glutamine deamination by the two isoforms of glutaminase, (ii) glutamine transamination leading to the production of the putative neurotoxin alpha-ketoglutaramate and (iii) alterations of high affinity astrocytic glutamine transporters (SNATs). Findings of reduced expression of the glutamine transporter SNAT-5 (responsible for glutamine clearance from the astrocyte) in ALF raise the possibility of "glutamine trapping" within these cells. Such a trapping mechanism could contribute to cytotoxic brain edema and to the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in this disorder. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

While the adverse developmental effects of these pesticides on child cognitive functions are well known, the effects of developmental exposure to OP on sensory processes have not been investigated. The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess the effects of prenatal and childhood exposure to 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT) and its major metabolite 1,1,-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), on visual processing in Inuit children in Nunavik (Arctic Quebec). p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE concentrations were determined from umbilical cord and 5- and 11-year plasma samples. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were successfully recorded in 150 children at 4 contrast levels (95%, 30%, 12%, and 4%). Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to determine the association between p,p'-DDT, or p,p'-DDE, exposure and VEPs while controlling for the effects of various confounders, including fish nutrients and other contaminants. p,p'-DDE measured in umbilical cord plasma was significantly related to the amplitude of the N150 response at the lowest contrast (4%). In addition, 5-year p,p'-DDE plasma concentration was significantly associated with decreased N75 amplitude. These findings indicate that p,p'-DDE exposure, both pre- and postnatally, during early childhood is associated with visual processing impairment later in life. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Our patient underwent an uncomplicated Monti ileovesicostomy at age 16 for a neurogenic bladder. She presented 10 years later with difficulty catheterizing the stoma. A biopsy of peristomal tissue showed moderately differentiated SCC. A cystoscopy did not reveal any bladder tumours or suspicious lesions. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate metastasis. The patient underwent a complete en bloc resection of the stomal site, the Monti, a partial cuff of bladder, and 2 loops of bowel that were adherent to the Monti. Final pathology revealed pure invasive SCC arising around the stoma and negative surgical margins. Six months later, a follow-up CT scan showed no evidence of malignancy, while a cystoscopy revealed a small erythematous area in the posterior bladder wall. Urinary cytology was positive for SCC. Transurethral resection of the erythematous lesion with random bladder biopsies showed SCC in situ in the erythematous lesion and right lateral bladder wall. Staging workup was negative. The patient subsequently underwent a radical cystectomy and ileal conduit diversion with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Final pathology on cystectomy specimen was SCC in situ without evidence of invasive carcinoma. The patient has remained in remission at the 3-year follow-up.

The consumption of cannabis is ten times higher among schizophrenia patients, suggesting that these patients could be differentially sensitive to its motivational effects. To study this question, we investigated the motivational effects of cannabinoid agonists using the brain stimulation reward paradigm and a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia: neonatal ventral hippocampus lesions (NVHL). Using the curve-shift paradigm, we first compared the effect single dose (0.75 mg/kg) of amphetamine in sham and NVHL rats on reward and operant responding. Then, in different groups of NVHL and sham rats, we studied the effect of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinnol (THC, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and WIN55,212-2 (WIN, 1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) Rats were initially trained to self-administer an electrical stimulation to the posterio-medial mesencephalon. Once responding was stable, reward threshold defined as the frequency required to induce a half maximum response rate was measured before and after injection of the drug or the vehicle. Results show that amphetamine enhanced reward in sham and NVHL rats, an effect that was shorter in duration in NVHL rats. THC produced a weak attenuation of reward in sham rats while WIN produced a dose-dependent attenuation in NVHL; the attenuation effect of WIN was blocked by the cannabinoid antagonist, AM251. WIN also produced an attenuation of performance in sham and NVHL rats, and this effect was partially prevented by AM251. These results provide the additional evidence that the motivational effect of cannabinoids is altered in animals with a schizophrenia-like phenotype. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Effects of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate on MRI measures in the Phase 3 DEFINE study	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Brain atrophy; Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate; Lesion; MRI; Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis	RELAPSING MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; ORAL BG-12; CELLS; FINGOLIMOD; PATHWAY; LESIONS; IMPACT	In the Phase 3 DEFINE study, delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) 240 mg twice (BID) and three times daily (TID) significantly reduced the mean number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesion activity at 2 years in patients (MRI cohort; n = 540) with relapsing-remitting MS. The analyses described here expand on these results by considering additional MRI measures (number of T1-hypointense lesions; volume of T2-hyperintense, Gd+, and T1-hypointense lesions; brain atrophy), delineating the time course of the effects, and examining the generality of the effects across a diverse patient population. Reductions in lesion counts with delayed-release DMF BID and TID, respectively, vs. placebo were apparent by the first MRI assessment at 6 months [T2-hyperintense: 80 and 69 % reduction (both P < 0.0001); Gd+, 94 and 81 % reduction (both P < 0.0001); T1-hypointense: 58 % (P < 0.0001) and 48 % (P = 0.0005) reduction] and maintained at 1 and 2 years. Reductions in lesion volume were statistically significant beginning at 6 months for T2-hyperintense [P = 0.0002 (BID) and P = 0.0035 (TID)] and Gd+ lesions [P = 0.0059 (BID) and P = 0.0176 (TID)] and beginning at 1 year [P = 0.0126 (BID)] to 2 years [P = 0.0063 (TID)] for T1-hypointense lesions. Relative reductions in brain atrophy from baseline to 2 years (21 % reduction; P = 0.0449) and 6 months to 2 years (30 % reduction; P = 0.0214) were statistically significant for delayed-release DMF BID. The effect of delayed-release DMF on mean number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions and Gd+ lesion activity was consistent across pre-specified patient subpopulations. Collectively, these results suggest that delayed-release DMF favorably affects multiple aspects of MS pathophysiology.

This article reviews the rationale for use of metabotropic glutamate 5-receptor antagonists in experimental and clinical L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed (between May 2012 March 2014) for relevant English language articles using PubMed. Additional articles of interest were identified from reference lists of included publications. Relevant clinical abstracts from Movement Disorder Society meetings were included. Results: 16 preclinical studies of metabotropic glutamate 5-receptor antagonists in animal models of L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias and 7 clinical studies in patients with Parkinson's disease and L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias were included. Anti-dyskinetic effects of metabotropic glutamate 5-receptor blockade (MPEP, MTEP, fenobam, or MRZ-8676) were reported in dyskinetic 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. Studies in MPTP-lesioned non-human primates reported anti-dyskinetic effects of MPEP, MTEP, fenobam and mavoglurant (AFQ056). Three randomized, double-blind clinical trials reported antidyskinetic efficacy of mavoglurant, without effects on anti-parkinsonian therapy, with dizziness the most common adverse event. However, two further studies failed to demonstrate significant anti-dyskinetic efficacy. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety study of dipraglurant (ADX48621) demonstrated tolerability and positive exploratory secondary outcomes of reduced dyskinesia. Conclusions: Animal model studies provide evidence for anti-dyskinetic efficacy of metabotropic glutamate 5-receptor antagonists. Initial proof-of-concept clinical trials of mavoglurant and dipraglurant showed positive results; anti-dyskinetic efficacy was not supported by two recent mavoglurant trials. Further evaluations of optimal dosage and long-term efficacy and safety of metabotropic glutamate 5-receptor antagonists for management of L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease are required.

The objective of this article is to review the design, implementation, and analysis of recent point prevalence studies investigating the global epidemiology of pediatric critical illness. Data Sources: Literature review and primary datasets. Study Selection: Multicenter, international point prevalence studies performed in PICUs since 2007. Data Extraction: Study topic, number of sites, number of study days, patients screened, prevalence of disease, use of specified therapies, and outcomes. Data Synthesis: Since 2007, five-point prevalence studies have been performed on acute lung injury, neurologic disease, thromboprophylaxis, fluid resuscitation, and sepsis in PICUs. These studies were performed in 59-120 sites in 7-28 countries. All studies accounted for seasonal variation in pediatric disease by collecting data over multiple study days. Studies screened up to 6,317 patients and reported data on prevalence and therapeutic variability. Three studies also reported short-term outcomes, a valuable but atypical data element in point prevalence studies. Using these five studies as examples, the advantages and disadvantages and approach to designing, implementing, and analyzing point prevalence studies are reviewed. Conclusions: Point prevalence studies in pediatric critical care can efficiently provide valuable insight on the global epidemiology of disease and practice patterns for critically ill children.

Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) has been shown to be efficacious and relatively safe for major depressive disorder (MDD). However, its clinical utility as an augmenting strategy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) remains unexplored. Methods. In an open label trial, 17 outpatients with severe TRD received 4 weeks of daily high frequency DTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Depressive and anxious symptoms, suicidality and quality of life (QOL) were measured at baseline (i.e., in the week prior to the start of the DTMS treatment) and at week 5 (i.e., in the week following the end of the DTMS treatment). Primary outcome measures were rates of response and remission at week 5 using an intention-to-treat approach. Results. Response and remission rates at week 5 were 70.6 and 41.2%, respectively. Also, depression, anxiety, and suicidality ratings were significantly improved by week 5 (with Hedges' g estimates ranging from 0.6 to 1.72), as well as four of the five QOL domain scores (i.e., global, psychological, environmental and social). Finally, two patients dropped out of the study at week 1 because of significant scalp discomfort during stimulation. Conclusions. Our study suggests that DTMS, when used as an augmenting strategy for antidepressants in severe TRD, is efficacious, safe and relatively well tolerated. However, controlled studies with larger samples are needed to confirm and expand our preliminary findings.

Anne			Prolonged ampakine exposure prunes dendritic spines and increases presynaptic release probability for enhanced long-term potentiation in the hippocampus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						CX546; LTP; organotypic hippocampal slices; synaptic plasticity; synaptic transmission	NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; STRUCTURAL PLASTICITY; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; ACTIN POLYMERIZATION; EXCITATORY SYNAPSES; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; MENTAL-RETARDATION; HEAD PROTRUSIONS; SLICE CULTURES	CX 546, an allosteric positive modulator of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs), belongs to a drug class called ampakines. These compounds have been shown to enhance long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model of learning and memory, and improve animal learning task performance, and have augmented cognition in neurodegenerative patients. However, the chronic effect of CX546 on synaptic structures has not been examined. The structure and integrity of dendritic spines are thought to play a role in learning and memory, and their abnormalities have been implicated in cognitive disorders. In addition, their structural plasticity has been shown to be important for cognitive function, such that dendritic spine remodeling has been proposed as the morphological correlate for LTP. Here, we tested the effect of CX546 on dendritic spine remodeling following long-term treatment. We found that, with prolonged CX546 treatment, organotypic hippocampal slice cultures showed a significant reduction in CA3-CA1 excitatory synapse and spine density. Electrophysiological approaches revealed that the CA3-CA1 circuitry compensates for this synapse loss by increasing synaptic efficacy through enhancement of presynaptic release probability. CX546-treated slices showed prolonged and enhanced potentiation upon LTP induction. Furthermore, structural plasticity, namely spine head enlargement, was also more pronounced after CX546 treatment. Our results suggest a concordance of functional and structural changes that is enhanced with prolonged CX546 exposure. Thus, the improved cognitive ability of patients receiving ampakine treatment may result from the priming of synapses through increases in the structural plasticity and functional reliability of hippocampal synapses.

Mackey & M. Petrides (2010) Eur. J. Neurosci., 32, 1940-1950]. The present article provides greater detail with regard to the definition of architectonic areas within the ventromedial part of the human ventral frontal cortex and describes their location: (i) in Montreal Neurological Institute proportional stereotactic space; and (ii) in relation to sulcal landmarks. Structural magnetic resonance scans of four brains were obtained before the preparation of the histological specimens, so that the architectonic parcellation could be reconstructed in its original three-dimensional volume. The areal density of individual cortical layers was sampled quantitatively in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of eight brains (16 hemispheres). The agranular cortex along the ventral edge of the corpus callosum and posterior margin of the ventromedial surface is replaced by a graded series of increasingly granular and more complexly laminated areas that succeed one another in a posterior-to-anterior direction. In parallel, the width of the supragranular layers (i.e. layers II and III) increases as compared with the infragranular layers (i.e. layers V and VI) from posterior to anterior. A measure of how rapidly cortical features change at areal boundaries also showed that the rate of change in the granule and pyramidal cell densities of layers IV and V, respectively, was greater at the borders between posterior areas than between anterior areas. This article will facilitate the anatomical identification and comparison of experimental data involving the human vmPFC.

Despite therapeutic measures, the long-term outcome is often unsatisfactory. This retrospective multicentre study evaluates clinical, biochemical and genetic findings in 88 cblC patients. The questionnaire designed for the study evaluates clinical and biochemical features at both initial presentation and during follow up. Also the development of severity scores allows investigation of individual disease load, statistical evaluation of parameters between the different age of presentation groups, as well as a search for correlations between clinical endpoints and potential modifying factors. Results: No major differences were found between neonatal and early onset patients so that these groups were combined as an infantile-onset group representing 88 % of all cases. Hypotonia, lethargy, feeding problems and developmental delay were predominant in this group, while late-onset patients frequently presented with psychiatric/behaviour problems and myelopathy. Plasma total homocysteine was higher and methionine lower in infantile-onset patients. Plasma methionine levels correlated with "overall impression" as judged by treating physicians. Physician's impression of patient's well-being correlated with assessed disease load. We confirmed the association between homozygosity for the c.271dupA mutation and infantile-onset but not between homozygosity for c.394C > T and late-onset. Patients were treated with parenteral hydroxocobalamin, betaine, folate/folinic acid and carnitine resulting in improvement of biochemical abnormalities, non-neurological signs and mortality. However the long-term neurological and ophthalmological outcome is not significantly influenced. In summary the survey points to the need for prospective studies in a large cohort using agreed treatment modalities and monitoring criteria.

This Review discusses the prevalence and epidemiology of depression in patients with MS, before covering aetiological factors, including genetics, brain pathology, immunological changes, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and psychosocial influences. Treatment options such as antidepressant drugs, cognitive-behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, exercise and electroconvulsive therapy are also reviewed in the context of MS-related depression. Frequent comorbid conditions, namely pain, fatigue, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction and alcohol use, are also summarized. The article then explores three key challenges facing researchers and clinicians: what is the optimal way to define depression in the context of diseases such as MS, in which the psychiatric and neurological symptoms overlap; how can current knowledge about the biological and psychological underpinnings of MS-related depression be used to boost the validity of this construct; and can intervention be made more effective through use of combination therapies with additive or synergistic effects, which might exceed the modest benefits derived from their individual components?

Recollection and Familiarity in Aging Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: A Literature Review	NEUROPSYCHOLOGY REVIEW			English	Review						Recognition; Memory; Alzheimer; Mild cognitive impairment; Recollection; Familiarity	TEMPORAL-LOBE RESECTION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; REMEMBER-KNOW; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL DISSOCIATION; CLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION; CONSCIOUS RECOLLECTION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; SIGNAL-DETECTION; AGE-DIFFERENCES; REMAINS INTACT	Memory impairment is a central cognitive symptom in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer Disease (AD). Recognition tasks are often used to characterize and define the nature of memory deficits. Dual-process theories posit that familiarity and recollection are independently involved in the recognition of previously encountered material and both contribute to successful recognition. Recent evidence indicates that there is a double dissociation in the neuronal substrates of those two processes. More precisely, it has been suggested that perirhinal and entorhinal areas are selectively involved in familiarity-based recognition, while the hippocampus is associated with recollection. Interestingly, these regions are among the first to be targeted by neurofibrillary tangles, one of AD's neuropathological hallmarks. Impairment in recognition performance can occur in the very early stages of AD, such as MCI. To define the nature of recognition impairment in these clinical populations, we reviewed the current literature on familiarity and recollection performance in individuals with MCI and AD. Together with clinical features, methodological factors are taken into consideration in the interpretation of findings.

Corticosteroids in the management of brain-dead potential organ donors: a systematic review	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Review						adrenal cortex hormones; brain death; human; systematic review; tissue and organ procurement; transplantation	RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS-SYNDROME; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SEPTIC SHOCK; HORMONAL-THERAPY; RENAL-TRANSPLANTATION; STEROID PRETREATMENT; CADAVER DONORS; SEVERE SEPSIS; METHYLPREDNISOLONE; PROCUREMENT	Current guidelines recommend the administration of hormonal combination therapy including immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids to donors with low left ventricular ejection fractions and to consider hormonal therapy administration to all donors. However, these recommendations are largely based on observational data. The aim of this systematic review (SR) was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in brain-dead potential organ donors. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from the earliest accessible date up to March 2013 with a qualified librarian. Studies comparing the effects of any corticosteroid with those of placebo, standard treatment, or another active comparator were sought. Two independent reviewers evaluated each citation retrieved and selected studies independently and in duplicate. A third independent reviewer resolved any disagreement. Outcomes included donor haemodynamics and oxygenation, organ procurement, recipient survival, and graft survival. This review included 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. The majority used methylprednisolone and often combined it with other hormonal therapies. Ten out of the 11 RCTs yielded neutral results. However, in observational studies, use of corticosteroids generally resulted in improved donor haemodynamics and oxygenation status, increased organ procurement, and improved recipient and graft survival. Overall quality of included studies was poor, as most of them presented high risks of confounding. This SR highlights the low quality and conflicting evidence supporting the routine use of corticosteroids in the management of organ donors. A large trial evaluating the effect of corticosteroids on outcomes such as organ recovery and graft survival is warranted.	[Dupuis, S.; Amiel, J. -A.; Desgroseilliers, M.; Williamson, D.

Here we addressed the possibility that the cerebellum plays an important role in visual perceptual learning. Within the realm of motor control, the cerebellum supports learning of new skills and recalibration of motor commands when movement execution is consistently perturbed (adaptation). Growing evidence indicates that the cerebellum is also involved in cognition and mediates forms of cognitive learning. Therefore, the obvious question arises whether the cerebellum might play a similar role in learning and adaptation within the perceptual domain. We explored a possible deficit in visual perceptual learning (and adaptation) in patients with cerebellar damage using variants of a novel motion extrapolation, psychophysical paradigm. Compared to their age- and gender-matched controls, patients with focal damage to the posterior (but not the anterior) cerebellum showed strongly diminished learning, in terms of both rate and amount of improvement over time. Consistent with a double-dissociation pattern, patients with focal damage to the anterior cerebellum instead showed more severe clinical motor deficits, indicative of a distinct role of the anterior cerebellum in the motor domain. The collected evidence demonstrates that a pure form of slow-incremental visual perceptual learning is crucially dependent on the intact cerebellum, bearing the notion that the human cerebellum acts as a learning device for motor, cognitive and perceptual functions. We interpret the deficit in terms of an inability to fine-tune predictive models of the incoming flow of visual perceptual input over time. Moreover, our results suggest a strong dissociation between the role of different portions of the cerebellum in motor versus non-motor functions, with only the posterior lobe being responsible for learning in the perceptual domain.

However, the effects of aging and task demands on the functional integration of neural networks contributing to speech production abilities remain largely unexplored. In the present functional neuroimaging study, data-driven spatial independent component analysis and hierarchical measures of integration were used to explore age-related changes in functional connectivity among cortical areas contributing to semantic, orthographic, and automated word fluency tasks in healthy young and older adults, as well as to assess the effect of age and task demands on the functional integration of a verbal fluency network. The results showed that the functional integration of speech production networks decreases with age, while at the same time this has a marginal effect on behavioral outcomes in high-performing older adults. Moreover, a significant task demand/age interaction was found in functional connectivity within the anterior and posterior subnetworks of the verbal fluency network. These results suggest that local changes in functional integration among cortical areas supporting lexical speech production are modulated by age and task demands.

The cortical processes underlying this ability have received little attention. In two fMRI experiments, we investigated passive adaptation to (Exp. 1) and explicit discrimination of (Exp. 2) source identities for different categories of auditory objects (voices, musical instruments, environmental sounds). All cortical effects of source identity were independent of high-level category information, and were accounted for by sound-to-sound differences in low-level structure (e.g., loudness). A conjunction analysis revealed that the left posterior middle frontal gyrus (pMFG) adapted to identity repetitions during both passive listening and active discrimination tasks. These results indicate that the comparison of sound source identities in a stream of auditory stimulation recruits the pMFG in a domain-general way, i.e., independent of the sound category, based on information contained in the low-level acoustical structure. pMFG recruitment during both passive listening and explicit identity comparison tasks also suggests its automatic engagement in sound source identity processing.

Whereas participants in most psychological experiments sit upright, many prominent neuroimaging techniques (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) require participants to lie supine. Such postural discrepancies may hold important implications for brain function in general and for fMRI in particular. We directly investigated the effect of posture on spontaneous brain dynamics by recording scalp electrical activity in four orthostatic conditions (lying supine, inclined at 45 degrees, sitting upright, and standing erect). Here we show that upright versus supine posture increases widespread high-frequency oscillatory activity. Our electroencephalographic findings highlight the importance of posture as a determinant in neuroimaging. When generalizing supine imaging results to ecological human cognition, therefore, cognitive neuroscientists would benefit from considering the influence of posture on brain dynamics.

National programmes in several countries, collaborative research efforts, and an established international paediatric multiple sclerosis study group have contributed to revised clinical diagnostic definitions, identified dinical features of multiple sclerosis that differ by age of onset, and made recommendations regarding the treatment of paediatric multiple sclerosis. The relative risks conveyed by genetic and environmental factors to paediatric multiple sclerosis have been the subject of several large cohort studies. MRI features have been characterised in terms of qualitative descriptions of lesion distribution and applicability of MRI aspects to multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria, and quantitative studies have assessed total lesion burden and the effect of the disease on global and regional brain volume. Humoral-based and cell-based assays have identified antibodies against myelin, potassium-channel proteins, and T-cell profiles that support an adult-like T-cell repertoire and cellular reactivity against myelin in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis. Finally, the safety and efficacy of standard first-line therapies in paediatric multiple sclerosis populations are now appreciated in more detail, and consensus views on the future conduct and feasibility of phase 3 trials for new drugs have been proposed.

This reduction is thought to be due in part to age-related differences in encoding-related processes. In the current study, we performed an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies assessing age-related differences in the neural correlates of episodic encoding. Only studies using the subsequent memory paradigm were included. We found age-related under-recruitment of occipital and fusiform cortex, but over-recruitment in a set of regions including bilateral middle/superior frontal gyri, anterior medial frontal gyms, precuneus and left inferior parietal lobe. We demonstrate that all of the regions consistently over-recruited by older adults during successful encoding exhibit either direct overlap, or occur in close vicinity to regions consistently involved in unsuccessful encoding in young adults. We discuss the possibility that this overall pattern of age-related differences represents an age-related shift in focus: away from perceptual details, and toward evaluative and personal thoughts and feelings during memory tasks. We discuss whether these age-related differences in brain activation benefit performance in older adults, and additional considerations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Canuck Place Children's Hospice (CPCH) is North America's first freestanding pediatric hospice. This study describes the characteristics of and services delivered to all children on the CPCH program from 1996 to 2010. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patient medical records CPCH was conducted. Analyses examined trends and correlations between 40 selected data points: linear regression modeling was used to assess trends over time; t tests were used to examine significant associations between independent means; and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to measure survival probabilities. RESULTS: The study cohort included 649 children. The majority of diagnoses belonged to cancers (30%), and diseases of the neuromuscular (20%), and central nervous systems (18%). The majority of deaths occurred among the cancer (45%), central nervous system (15%), and metabolic disease groups (14%). By study end date, 24% of children were still alive, 61% died, and 15% transitioned to adult services (more than half of whom were cognitively competent). On average, 1024 days were spent on the CPCH program (median = 301). The majority of inpatient hospice discharges were for respite (82%); only 7% were for end-of-life care. Location of death was shared between CPCH (61%), hospital (22%), and home (16%). CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic groups largely determine the nature and magnitude of services used, and our involvement with pediatric life-threatening conditions is increasing. Reviews of pediatric palliative programs can help evaluate the services needed by the population served.

Method: This study analyzed cortical morphology using surface-based morphometry in 92 subjects (age range 11-18 years, 52 healthy controls and 40 adolescents with early-onset first-episode psychosis diagnosed with schizophrenia (n=20) or bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms (n=20) based on a two year clinical follow up). Average lobar cortical thickness, surface area, gyrification index (GI) and sulcal width were compared between groups, and the relationship between the GI and sulcal width was assessed in the patient group. Results: Both patients groups showed decreased cortical thickness and increased sulcal width in the frontal cortex when compared to healthy controls. The schizophrenia subgroup also had increased sulcal width in all other lobes. In the frontal cortex of the combined patient group sulcal width was negatively correlated (r = -0.58, p < 0.001) with the GI. Conclusions: In adolescents with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms there is cortical thinning, decreased GI and increased sulcal width of the frontal cortex present at the time of the first psychotic episode. Decreased frontal GI is associated with the widening of the frontal sulci which may reduce sulcal surface area. These results suggest that abnormal growth (or more pronounced shrinkage during adolescence) of the frontal cortex represents a shared endophenotype for psychosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia during worry forecasts stress-related increases in psychological distress	STRESS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON THE BIOLOGY OF STRESS			English	Article						Academic stress; autonomic function; emotion regulation; heart rate variability; RSA; worry catastrophizing	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CARDIAC VAGAL CONTROL; NEUROVISCERAL INTEGRATION; AUTONOMIC FLEXIBILITY; EMOTION REGULATION; MENTAL STRESS; ANXIETY; RESPONSES; DEPRESSION; REACTIVITY	Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been conceptualized as an index of emotion regulation abilities. Although resting RSA has been associated with both concurrent and prospective affective responses to stress, the impact of RSA reactivity on emotional responses to stress is inconsistent across studies. The type of emotional stimuli used to elicit these phasic RSA responses may influence the adaptive value of RSA reactivity. We propose that RSA reactivity to a personally relevant worry-based stressor might forecast future affective responses to stress. To evaluate whether resting RSA and RSA reactivity to worry inductions predict stress-related increases in psychological distress, an academic stress model was used to prospectively examine changes in psychological distress from the well-defined low-and high-stress periods. During the low-stress period, 76 participants completed self-report mood measures and had their RSA assessed during a resting baseline, free worry period and worry catastrophizing interview. Participants completed another mood assessment during the high-stress period. Results indicated that baseline psychological distress predicted larger decreases in RSA during the worry inductions. Lower resting RSA and greater RSA suppression to the worry inductions at baseline prospectively predicted larger increases in psychological distress from the low-to high-stress period, even after accounting for the impact of baseline distress on RSA. These results provide further evidence that RSA may represent a unique index of emotion regulation abilities in times of stress.

Crucial to understanding and promoting successful aging is determining which of these factors dominates for particular neurocognitive functions. Here, we focus on the human capacity for language, for which healthy older adults are simultaneously advantaged and disadvantaged. In recent years, a more hopeful view of cognitive aging has emerged from work suggesting that age-related declines in executive control functions are buffered by life-long bilingualism. In this paper, we selectively review what is currently known and unknown about bilingualism, executive control, and aging. Our ultimate goal is to advance the views that these issues should be reframed as a specific instance of neuroplasticity more generally and, in particular, that researchers should embrace the individual variability among bilinguals by adopting experimental and statistical approaches that respect the complexity of the questions addressed. In what follows, we set out the theoretical assumptions and empirical support of the bilingual advantages perspective, review what we know about language, cognitive control, and aging generally, and then highlight several of the relatively few studies that have investigated bilingual language processing in older adults, either on their own or in comparison with monolingual older adults. We conclude with several recommendations for how the field ought to proceed to achieve a more multifactorial view of bilingualism that emphasizes the notion of neuroplasticity over that of simple bilingual versus monolingual group comparisons.

However, the intermediate neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. Although human functional neuroimaging studies have reported that oxytocin effects on social behavior and emotional states are mediated by amygdala function, animal models indicate that oxytocin receptors in the ventral striatum (VS) modulate sensitivity to social reinforcers. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate OXTR-dependent brain mechanisms associated with social-affective problems. Methods: In a sample of 1445 adolescents we tested the effect of 23-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms across the OXTR region and stressful life events (SLEs) on functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent activity in the VS and amygdala to animated angry faces. Single nucleotide polymorphisms for which gene-wide significant effects on brain function were found were then carried forward to examine associations with social-affective problems. Results: A gene-wide significant effect of rs237915 showed that adolescents with minor CC-genotype had significantly lower VS activity than CT/TT-carriers. Significant or nominally significant gene x environment effects on emotional problems (in girls) and peer problems (in boys) revealed a strong increase in clinical symptoms as a function of SLEs in CT/TT-carriers but not CC-homozygotes. However, in low-SLE environments, CC-homozygotes had more emotional problems (girls) and peer problems (boys). Moreover, among CC-homozygotes, reduced VS activity was related to more peer problems. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a common OXTR-variant affects brain responsiveness to negative social cues and that in "riskcarriers" reduced sensitivity is simultaneously associated with more social-affective problems in "favorable environments" and greater resilience against stressful experiences.

Participants were individuals who ranged in age from 6 to 30 years. Consistent with previous findings, all participants showed curvature toward the distractor stimulus at shorter saccadic reaction times (SRTs). Chronological age, however, was positively related to participants' ability to inhibit distracting information as revealed by curvature away from the distractor stimulus at longer SRTs. Interestingly, no significant differences in saccadic reaction times were observed. Results are discussed in the context of similar findings comparing older and younger adults and the putative frontal neural mechanisms that contribute to the observed developmental effect. Our present results suggest that saccadic curvature can be used a tool to measure fontal-oculomotor control interaction across the life span and can be further used to examine inhibitory functioning in special pediatric populations (e.g., having brain trauma, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, frontal epilepsy).

Since the onset and severity of these disorders have been found to be closely related to stressful life events, and as stress alone has been shown to reduce hippocampal volume in animal studies, vulnerability to mood disorders may be related to a susceptibility to stress-induced hippocampal shrinkage. However, a smaller hippocampal volume before stress exposure has also been suggested to confer vulnerability of stressed individuals to PTSD or depression. In this study, we examined the contribution of either innate hippocampal volume differences or hippocampal susceptibility to stress-induced shrinkage to the formation of stress-related psychopathology using longitudinal MRI measurements of hippocampal volume in inbred C57 mice before and after chronic social defeat stress. We found that only half of the stressed C57 mice were susceptible to stress and developed psychopathological behaviors such as social avoidance. The other half was resilient to stress and exhibited no social avoidance. Before exposure to stress, we observed a positive correlation between hippocampal volume and social avoidance. After chronic social defeat stress, we found significant increases in left hippocampal volume in resilient and nonstressed control mice. Intriguingly, this increase in hippocampal volume was not found in susceptible mice, suggesting an arrestment of hippocampal growth in these mice. Our findings suggest that both a susceptibility to stress-induced hippocampal volume changes and a larger hippocampus before stress exposure confer vulnerability to psychopathology after chronic stress.

Multiple-Model Sensor and Components Fault Diagnosis in Gas Turbine Engines Using Autoassociative Neural Networks	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							TEST-BED; VALIDATION; IDENTIFICATION; SIMULATION	In this paper the problem of fault diagnosis in an aircraft jet engine is investigated by using an intelligent-based methodology. The proposed fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme is based on the multiple model approach and utilizes autoassociative neural networks (AANNs). This methodology consists of a bank of AANNs and provides a novel integrated solution to the problem of both sensor and component fault detection and isolation even though possibly both engine and sensor faults may occur concurrently. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be used for sensor data validation and correction as the first step for health monitoring of jet engines. We have also presented a comparison between our proposed approach and another commonly used neural network scheme known as dynamic neural networks to demonstrate the advantages and capabilities of our approach. Various simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance capabilities of our proposed fault detection and isolation scheme.	[Vanini, Z. N.

However, their contribution to disease initiation and development remains unclear. In this study, we induced EAE in lys-eGFP-ki mice and performed single, nonterminal intravital imaging to investigate BSCB permeability simultaneously with the kinetics of GFP(+) myeloid cell infiltration. We observed a loss in BSCB integrity within a day of disease onset, which paralleled the infiltration of GFP(+) cells into the CNS and lasted for similar to 4 d. Neutrophils accounted for a significant proportion of the circulating and CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells during the preclinical phase of EAE, and their depletion delayed the onset and reduced the severity of EAE while maintaining BSCB integrity. We also show that neutrophils collected from the blood or bone marrow of EAE mice transmigrate more efficiently than do neutrophils of naive animals in a BBB cell culture model. Moreover, using intravital videomicroscopy, we demonstrate that the IL-1R type 1 governs the firm adhesion of neutrophils to the inflamed spinal cord vasculature. Finally, immunostaining of postmortem CNS material obtained from an acutely ill multiple sclerosis patient and two neuromyelitis optica patients revealed instances of infiltrated neutrophils associated with regions of BBB or BSCB leakage. Taken together, our data provide evidence that neutrophils are involved in the initial events that take place during EAE and that they are intimately linked with the status of the BBB/BSCB.

Alzheimer's disease: early alterations in brain DNA methylation at ANK1, BIN1, RHBDF2 and other loci	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; RELIGIOUS ORDERS; WIDE ASSOCIATION; COMMON VARIANTS; AGING PROJECT; GENETIC RISK; RUSH MEMORY; GENOME; NEUROPATHOLOGY	We used a collection of 708 prospectively collected autopsied brains to assess the methylation state of the brain's DNA in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that the level of methylation at 71 of the 415,848 interrogated CpGs was significantly associated with the burden of AD pathology, including CpGs in the ABCA7 and BIN1 regions, which harbor known AD susceptibility variants. We validated 11 of the differentially methylated regions in an independent set of 117 subjects. Furthermore, we functionally validated these CpG associations and identified the nearby genes whose RNA expression was altered in AD: ANK1, CDH23, DIP2A, RHBDF2, RPL13, SERPINF1 and SERPINF2. Our analyses suggest that these DNA methylation changes may have a role in the onset of AD given that we observed them in presymptomatic subjects and that six of the validated genes connect to a known AD susceptibility gene network.

Sharp emergence of feature-selective sustained activity along the dorsal visual pathway	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL AREA MT; WORKING-MEMORY; MOTION TASK; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MACAQUE; NEURONS; DIRECTION; PARIETAL; SIGNALS	Sustained activity encoding visual working memory representations has been observed in several cortical areas of primates. Where along the visual pathways this activity emerges remains unknown. Here we show in macaques that sustained spiking activity encoding memorized visual motion directions is absent in direction-selective neurons in early visual area middle temporal (MT). However, it is robustly present immediately downstream, in multimodal association area medial superior temporal (MST), as well as and in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). This sharp emergence of sustained activity along the dorsal visual pathway suggests a functional boundary between early visual areas, which encode sensory inputs, and downstream association areas, which additionally encode mnemonic representations. Moreover, local field potential oscillations in MT encoded the memorized directions and, in the low frequencies, were phase-coherent with LPFC spikes. This suggests that LPFC sustained activity modulates synaptic activity in MT, a putative top-down mechanism by which memory signals influence stimulus processing in early visual cortex.

The authors' goal was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates of cognitive insight during an external source memory paradigm in non-clinical subjects. Methods: At encoding, 24 non-clinical subjects travelled through a virtual city where they came across 20 separate people, each paired with a unique object in a distinct location. fMRI data were then acquired while participants viewed images of the city, and completed source recognition memory judgments of where and with whom objects were seen, which is known to involve prefrontal cortex. Cognitive insight was assessed with the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale. Results: External source memory was associated with neural activity in a widespread network consisting of frontal cortex, including ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), temporal and occipital cortices. Activation in VLPFC correlated with higher selfreflectiveness and activation in midbrain correlated with lower self-certainty during source memory attributions. Neither self-reflectiveness nor self-certainty significantly correlated with source memory accuracy. Conclusion: By means of virtual reality and in the context of an external source memory paradigm, the study identified a preliminary functional neural basis for cognitive insight in the VLPFC in healthy people that accords with our fronto-hippocampal theoretical model as well as recent neuroimaging data in people with psychosis. The results may facilitate the understanding of the role of neural mechanisms in psychotic disorders associated with cognitive insight distortions.

J	Bouchard, P; Legault, P				Bouchard, Patricia; Legault, Pascale			A remarkably stable kissing-loop interaction defines substrate recognition by the Neurospora Varkud Satellite ribozyme	RNA-A PUBLICATION OF THE RNA SOCIETY			English	Article						Neurospora VS ribozyme; substrate recognition; U-turn; kissing-loop interaction; isothermal titration calorimetry	ISOTHERMAL TITRATION CALORIMETRY; SURFACE-PLASMON RESONANCE; ACTIVE-SITE; SECONDARY-STRUCTURE; TRANSFER-RNA; CLEAVAGE SITE; SELF-CLEAVAGE; NMR STRUCTURE; THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS; MECHANICAL STABILITY	Kissing loops are tertiary structure elements that often play key roles in functional RNAs. In the Neurospora VS ribozyme, a kissing-loop interaction between the stem loop I (SLI) substrate and stem loop V (SLV) of the catalytic domain is known to play an important role in substrate recognition. In addition, this I/V kissing-loop interaction is associated with a helix shift in SE] that activates the substrate for catalysis. To better understand the role of this kissing-loop interaction in substrate recognition and activation by the VS ribozyme, we performed a thermodynamic characterization by isothermal titration calorimetry using isolated SLI and Sly stem loops. We demonstrate that preshifted SE] variants have higher affinity for SLV than shiftable SLI variants, with an energetic cost of 1.8-3 kcal/mol for the helix shift in SLI. The affinity of the preshifted SLI for SLV is remarkably high, the interaction being more stable by 7-8 kcal/mol than predicted for a comparable duplex containing three Watson Crick base pairs. The structural basis of this remarkable stability is discussed in light of previous NMR studies. Comparative thermodynamic studies reveal that kissing-loop complexes containing 6-7 Watson Crick base pairs are as stable as predicted from comparable RNA duplexes; however, those with 2-3 Watson Crick base pairs are more stable than predicted. Interestingly, the stability of SLI/ribozyme complexes is similar to that of SLI/SLV complexes. Thus, the I/V kissing loop interaction represents the predominant energetic contribution to substrate recognition by the trans-cleaving VS ribozyme.

Sexuality after SCI is a complex issue that is influenced by a number of social, psychological and physiological factors, including urinary incontinence (UI). To examine the experience of sexuality for women with SCI, to determine the impact of UI on sexual function and sexual satisfaction in these women, and to identify their main concerns regarding UI and sexuality. Using a phenomenological approach, seven in-depth interviews combining the interview guide approach and standardized open-ended questions were conducted. Two main categories were identified: Sexuality and the impact of UI on sexuality. Related themes were uncovered within each category. Both categories revealed emerging themes including 13 for sexuality and 10 for the impact of UI on sexuality. Five additional themes relevant to the research question but that did not fit into the initial categories were also identified. Intimacy and the sexual experience were negatively affected by UI as a result of SCI, and by an excessive concern about autonomic dysreflexia. There is a significant shortage of information available for women with SCI regarding sexual function in general, but more specifically, a lack of information on sexual function as it relates to UI. Future research should focus on creating resources to assist in this area which may improve the quality of life for these individuals.

While the gold standard for amyloid imaging, carbon-11 labeled Pittsburgh compound B is increasingly being replaced by fluorine-18 labeled radiopharmaceuticals, with three already approved for clinical use by US and European regulatory bodies. Appropriate use criteria proposed by an amyloid imaging taskforce convened by the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging recommend restricting use of this technology to the evaluation of patients with mild cognitive impairment or atypical dementia syndromes. While use among asymptomatic individuals is currently viewed as inappropriate due prognostic uncertainty, elevated levels of brain Ab among asymptomatic individuals may represent preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid imaging is likewise expected to play a role in the design of clinical trials. Though preliminary results suggest amyloid imaging to possess clinical utility and cost-effectiveness, both domains have yet to be assessed systematically. As the field moves toward adoption of a pro-disclosure stance for amyloid imaging findings, it is imperative that a broad range of stakeholders be involved to ensure the appropriateness of emerging policies and protocols.

The aim of this study is to compare the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to epileptic spikes in patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and those with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). In EEG-fMRI studies, the HRF represents the temporal evolution of blood oxygenation level-dependent signal changes. Several studies demonstrated that amplitude and latency of the HRF are variable in patients with epilepsy. However, the consistency of HRF parameters with underlying brain pathology is unknown. In this study, we examined 14 patients with FCD and 12 with unilateral HS selected from our EEG-fMRI database and compared the amplitude and latency of the HRF peak. We analyzed (1) HRFs in peak activation clusters, (2) HRFs in peak deactivation clusters, and (3) the maximum absolute responses within the EEG spike field, activation or deactivation. We found that the HRF peak amplitude in deactivation clusters was larger in the HS group than in the FCD when the deactivation occurred in default mode network (DMN) regions. This result suggests that spikes in patients with HS affect the DMN more strongly than those with FCD. However, if we focus on the maximum absolute t-value in the spike field, there is no significant difference between the two groups. The current study indicates that it is not necessary to use different HRF models for EEG-fMRI studies in patients with FCD and HS.

Scalp EEG is not a Blur: It Can See High Frequency Oscillations Although Their Generators are Small	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						High frequency oscillations; Scalp HFO; Ripple; Simultaneous scalp and subdural EEG; Spatial sampling	IN-VIVO; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; EPILEPTIC PATIENTS; HUMAN SKULL; BRAIN; HZ; EPILEPTOGENICITY; RECORDINGS; MARKER; SLEEP	High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are emerging as biomarkers of epileptogenicity. They have been shown to originate from small brain regions. Surprisingly, spontaneous HFOs can be recorded from the scalp. To understand how is it possible to observe these small events on the scalp, one avenue is the analysis of the cortical correlates at the time of scalp HFOs. Using simultaneous scalp and intracranial recordings of 11 patients, we studied the spatial distribution of scalp events on the cortical surface. For typical interictal epileptiform discharges the subdural distributions were, as expected, spatially extended. On the contrary, for scalp HFOs the subdural maps corresponded to focal sources, consisting of one or a few small spatial extent activations. These topographies suggest that small cortical areas generated the HFOs seen on the scalp. Similar scalp distributions corresponded to distinct distributions on a standard 1 cm subdural grid and averaging similar scalp HFOs resulted in focal subdural maps. The assumption that a subdural grid "sees" everything that contributes to the potential of nearby scalp contacts was not valid for HFOs. The results suggest that these small extent events are spatially undersampled with standard scalp and grid inter-electrode distances. High-density scalp electrode distributions seem necessary to obtain a solid sampling of HFOs on the scalp. A better understanding of the influence of spatial sampling on the observation of high frequency brain activity on the scalp is important for their clinical use as biomarkers of epilepsy.

Scalar and vector valued quantification of smoothness energy configures images for Bayesian and variational denoising modes, respectively. Within variational mode, the choice of norm adapts images for either total variation or Tikhonov technique. Our proposal has three significant contributions. First, it demonstrates that the four-neighborhood clique kernel is a basic filter, in same class as Gaussian and wavelet filters, from which state-of-the-art denoising algorithms are derived. Second, we formulate theoretical analysis, which connects and integrates Bayesian and variational techniques into a two-layer structured denoising system. Third, our proposal reveals that the first layer of the new denoising system is a hitherto unknown form of Markov random field model referred to as single-layer Markov random field (SLMRF). The new model denoises a specific type of medical image by minimizing energy subject to knowledge of mathematical model that describes relationship between the image smoothness energy and noise level but without reference to a classical prior model. SLMRF was applied to and evaluated on two real brain magnetic resonance imaging datasets acquired with different protocols. Comparative performance evaluation shows that our proposal is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms. SLMRF is simple and computationally efficient because it does not incorporate a regularization parameter. Furthermore, it preserves edges and its output is devoid of blurring and ringing artifacts associated with Gaussian-based and wavelet-based algorithms. The denoising system is potentially applicable to speckle reduction in ultrasound images and extendable to three-layer structure that account for texture features in medical images.

Algorithm and Architecture of Fully-Parallel Associative Memories Based on Sparse Clustered Networks	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Associative memories; Hopfield neural networks; FPGA-based VLSI implementation; Sparse clustered networks	NEURAL-NETWORKS; DESIGN	Associative memories retrieve stored information given partial or erroneous input patterns. A new family of associative memories based on Sparse Clustered Networks (SCNs) has been recently introduced that can store many more messages than classical Hopfield-Neural Networks (HNNs). In this paper, we propose fully-parallel hardware architectures of such memories for partial or erroneous inputs. The proposed architectures eliminate winner-take-all modules and thus reduce the hardware complexity by consuming 65 % fewer FPGA lookup tables and increase the operating frequency by approximately 1.9 times compared to that of previous work. Furthermore, the scaling behaviour of the implemented architectures for various design choices are investigated. We explore the effect of varying design variables such as the number of clusters, network nodes, and erased symbols on the error performance and the hardware resources.

LUMA depends on digestion of DNA with methyl-sensitive and methyl-insensitive restriction enzymes, followed by pyrosequencing. Until recently, LUMA has been principally used for biomedical research. Here, we use chickens as a model to investigate sample quality issues relating to LUMA and then apply the method to ecological species. First, we assessed the effect of tissue storage conditions on DNA methylation values. This is an important consideration for ecological species because samples are not always ideally preserved and LUMA is sensitive to poor DNA quality. We found that good quality LUMA data could be obtained from chicken liver and brain tissues stored at 21 degrees C for at least 2 and 12 h, respectively. Longer storage times introduced nonspecific peaks to pyrograms which were associated with reduced DNA methylation. Repeatedly, freezing and thawing the tissues did not affect LUMA data. Second, we measured DNA methylation in 12 species representing five animal classes: amphibians (African and Western clawed frog), reptiles (green anole lizard), fish (yellow perch, goldfish, lake trout), mammals (American mink, polar bear, short-beaked common dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin) and birds (chicken, Japanese quail). We saw a pattern of high DNA methylation in fish (84-87%), and intermediate levels in mammals (68-72%) and birds (52-71%). This pattern corresponds well with previous measures of DNA methylation generated by HPLC. Our data represent the first CpG methylation values to be reported in several species and provide a basis for studying patterns of epigenetic inheritance in an ecological context.

We analyzed the annual soil respiration (Rs) rates and the temperature sensitivities of seven forest ecosystems, including evergreen broadleaf forests (EBF), deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF), broadleaf and needleleaf mixed forests (BNMF), evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF), deciduous needleleaf forests (DNF), bamboo forests (BF) and shrubs (SF). The results showed that the mean annual Rs rate was 33.65 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) across Chinese forest ecosystems. Rs rates were significantly different (P < 0.001) among the seven forest types, and were significantly and positively influenced by mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and actual evapotranspiration (AET); but negatively affected by latitude and elevation. The mean Q(10) value of 1.28 was lower than the world average (1.4-2.0). The Q(10) values derived from the soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm varied among forest ecosystems by an average of 2.46 and significantly decreased with the MAT but increased with elevation and latitude. Moreover, our results suggested that an artificial neural network (ANN) model can effectively predict Rs across Chinese forest ecosystems. This study contributes to better understanding of Rs across Chinese forest ecosystems and their possible responses to global warming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although dopaminergic (D2) transmission in the ventral striatum (VS) is associated with motivation, learning, and cognition are more strongly associated with function of the dorsal striatum, including activation in the caudate nucleus. A recent study found an interaction between intrinsic motivation and the DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphism (rs1800497), suggesting that A-carriers of rs1800497 are significantly more sensitive to motivation in order to improve during working memory (WM) training. Using data from the two large-scale imaging genetic data sets, IMAGEN (n = 1080, age 13-15 years) and BrainChild (n 300, age 6-27), we investigated whether rs 1800497 is associated with WM. In the IMAGEN data set, we tested whether VS/caudate activation during reward anticipation was associated with WM performance and whether rs1800497 and VS/caudate activation interact to affect WM performance. We found that rs1800497 was associated with WM performance in IMAGEN and BrainChild. Higher VS and caudate activation during reward processing were significantly associated with higher WM performance (p < 0.0001). An interaction was found between the DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphism rs 1800497 and VS activation during reward anticipation on WM (p < 0.01), such that carriers of the minor allele (A) showed a significant correlation between VS activation and WM, whereas the GG-homozygotes did not, suggesting that the effect of VS BOLD on WM is modified by inter-individual genetic differences related to D2 dopaminergic transmission.

Epigenetic factors are likely to act both distally and proximally. Aspirational Goal 1 aims to find clear targets for suicide and suicidal behavior intervention through greater understanding of the interplay among the biological, psychological, and social risk and protective factors associated with suicide. This paper discusses Aspirational Goal 1, focusing on the research pathway related to epigenetics, suicide, and suicidal behaviors. Current knowledge on epigenetic factors associated with suicide and suicidal behaviors is reviewed and avenues for future research are discussed. Epigenetic factors are a promising area of further investigation in the understanding of suicide and suicidal behaviors and may hold clues to identifying targets or avenues for intervention.

The presence of the e4 allele has been associated with lower levels of apoE in both serum and brain tissues of normal and AD subjects. In an attempt to reverse the apoE deficit in AD, we identified and characterized several apoE inducer agents using a low-throughput in vitro screening assay. The most promising of these compounds is called probucol. Administration of probucol, an old cholesterol-lowering drug, in a pilot trial in mild-to-moderate sporadic AD led to a significant increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) apoE levels and a decrease in CSF in both phosphorylated tau 181 and beta-amyloid 1-42 concentrations without significant modifications of lipid hydroperoxide levels.

Limbic system mGluR5 availability in cocaine dependent subjects: A high-resolution PET [C-11]ABP688 study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; Glutamate; Striatum; Addiction; Abstinence; Relapse	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DRUG-ADDICTION; NEURAL BASIS; IN-VIVO; ACTIVATION	Cocaine self-administration decreases type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) tissue concentrations in laboratory rats during early abstinence. These changes are thought to influence the drug's reinforcing properties and the ability of drug-related cues to induce relapse. Here, our goal was to measure brain regional mGluR5 availability in recently abstinent cocaine dependent humans. Participants meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for current cocaine dependence (n = 9) were recruited-from the general population. mGluR5 availability (binding potential, non-displaceable; BPND) was measured with high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET MKT) and [C-11]ABP688. Compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 9), cocaine dependent subjects showed significantly lower BPND values in the ventral (bilateral: -282%, p = 0.011), associative (right -21.4%, p = 0.043), and sensorimotor striatum (bilateral: -21.7%, p = 0.045), amygdala (left: -26%, p = 0.046) and insula (light -233%, p = 0.041). Among the cocaine users, receptor availabilities were related to abstinence (range: 2 to 14 days). The longer the duration of abstinence, the lower the BPND values in the sensorimotor striatum (r = -0.71, p = 0.034), left amygdala (r = -033. p = 0.026) and right insula (r = p = 0.046). Compared to healthy controls, BPND values were significantly reduced in those who tested negative for cocaine on the PET test session in the ventral (p = 0.018) and sensoranotor striatum (p = 0.017), left amygdala (p = 0.008), and right insula (p = 0.029), but not in those who tested positive. Together, these results provide evidence of time-related mGluR5 alterations in striatal and limbic regions in humans during early cocaine abstinence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the specific contribution of different muscarinic receptor subtypes in these neuromodulatory mechanisms is not fully understood. The present study evaluates in vivo the functional organization and the properties of the visual cortex of different groups of muscarinic receptor knock-out (KO) mice. Optical imaging of intrinsic signals coupled to continuous and episodic visual stimulation paradigms was used. Retinotopic maps along elevation and azimuth were preserved among the different groups of mice. However, compared to their wild-type counterparts, the apparent visual field along elevation was larger in M2/M4-KO mice but smaller in M1-KO. There was a reduction in the estimated relative receptive field size of V1 neurons in M1/M3-KO and M1-KO mice. Spatial frequency and contrast selectivity of V1 neuronal populations were affected only in M1/M3-KO and M1-KO mice. Finally, the neuronal connectivity was altered by the absence of M2/M4 muscarinic receptors. All these effects suggest the distinct roles of different subtypes of muscarinic receptors in the intrinsic organization of V1 and a strong involvement of the muscarinic transmission in the detectability of visual stimuli.

Conventional methods employ standard atlas coordinates to target the STN, which, along with the adjacent red nucleus (RN) and substantia nigra (SN), are not well visualized on conventional T1w MRIs. However, the positions and sizes of the nuclei may be more variable than the standard atlas, thus making the pre-surgical plans inaccurate. We investigated the morphometric variability of the STN, RN and SN by using label-fusion segmentation results from 3T high resolution T2w MRIs of 33 advanced PD patients. In addition to comparing the size and position measurements of the cohort to the Talairach atlas, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to acquire more intuitive and detailed perspectives of the measured variability. Lastly, the potential correlation between the variability shown by PCA results and the clinical scores was explored. Hum Brain Mapp 35:4330-4344, 2014. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BOLD activations and deactivations can be found within the epileptogenic zone but also at a distance. Source imaging identifies electric (ESI) and magnetic (MSI) sources of IEDs, with the advantage of a higher temporal resolution. Therefore, the objective of our study was to evaluate the spatial concordance between ESI/MSI and BOLD responses for similar IEDs. Methods: Twenty-one patients with similar IEDs in simultaneous electroencephalogram/functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG/fMRI) and in simultaneous EEG/magnetoencephalogram (MEG) recordings were studied. IEDs in EEG/fMRI acquisition were analyzed in an event-related paradigm within a general linear model (GLM). ESI/MSI of averaged IEDs was performed using the Maximum Entropy on the Mean. We assessed the spatial concordance between ESI/MSI and clusters of BOLD activations/deactivations with surface-based metrics. Results: ESI/MSI were concordant with one BOLD cluster for 20/21 patients (concordance with activation: 14/21 patients, deactivation: 6/21 patients, no concordance: 1/21 patients; concordance with MSI only: 3/21, ESI only: 2/21). These BOLD clusters exhibited in 19/20 cases the most significant voxel. BOLD clusters that were spatially concordant with ESI/MSI were concordant with IEDs from invasive recordings in 8/11 patients (activations: 5/8, deactivations: 3/8). Conclusion: As the results of BOLD, ESI and MSI are often concordant, they reinforce our confidence in all of them. ESI and MSI confirm the most significant BOLD cluster within BOLD maps, emphasizing the importance of these clusters for the definition of the epileptic focus. Hum Brain Mapp 35:4396-4414, 2014.

As one of the first steps in quantifying such relations, we propose a method to investigate the relation between a designer's mental stress and mental effort. We hypothesize that mental effort is low at low and high stress levels but high at a medium stress level. To test the hypothesis, we conducted experiments on seven subjects. Design activities, body movements, brain signals and heart rate were recorded during a design process. Mental stress was quantified by LF/HF ratio and mental effort was quantified by EEG energy. The statistical analysis shows that mental effort is the lowest at high stress level and there is no significant difference in mental effort between medium stress level and low stress level.

Such networks are amenable to study using graph theory, which shows that they possess small world properties and can be used to differentiate healthy subjects and patient populations. Of particular interest is the possibility that some of these differences are related to alterations in the dopamine system. To investigate the role of dopamine in the topological organization of brain networks at rest, we tested the effects of reducing dopamine synthesis in 13 healthy subjects undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All subjects were scanned twice, in a resting state, following ingestion of one of two amino acid drinks in a randomized, double-blind manner. One drink was a nutritionally balanced amino acid mixture, and the other was tyrosine and phenylalanine deficient. Functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated for each individual subject under each dopaminergic condition. The lowered dopamine state caused the following network changes: reduced global and local efficiency of the whole brain network, reduced regional efficiency in limbic areas, reduced modularity of brain networks, and greater connection between the normally anti-correlated task-positive and default-mode networks. We conclude that dopamine plays a role in maintaining the efficient small-world properties and high modularity of functional brain networks, and in segregating the task-positive and default-mode networks.

The ERN is thought to reflect cognitive control processes aiming to improve performance. As previous studies showed a modulation of the ERN amplitude throughout the execution of a learning task, this study aims to follow the ERN amplitude changes from early to late learning blocks in relation with concomitant motor sequence learning using a serial reaction time (SRT) task. Twenty-two healthy participants completed a SRT task during which continuous EEG activity was recorded. The SRT task consists of series of stimulus-response pairs and involves motor learning of a repeating sequence. Learning was computed as the difference in mean response time between the last sequence block and the last random blocks that immediately follows it (sequence-specific learning). Event-related potentials were analysed to measure ERN amplitude elicited by error commission. Results: Mean ERN amplitude difference between the first four learning blocks and the last four learning blocks of the SRT task correlated significantly with motor sequence learning as well as with overall response time improvement, such that those participants whose ERN amplitude most increased through learning blocks were also those who exhibited most SRT task improvements. In contrast, neither sequence-specific learning nor overall response time improvement across learning blocks were found to be related to averaged ERN amplitude from all learning blocks. Conclusion: Findings from the present study suggest that the ERN amplitude changes from early to late learning blocks occurring over the course of the SRT task, as opposed to the averaged ERN amplitude from all learning blocks, is more closely associated with learning of a motor sequence. These findings propose an improved electrophysiological marker to index change in cognitive control efficiency during motor sequence learning.

Observational study of spinal muscular atrophy type I and implications for clinical trials	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							NATURAL-HISTORY; METABOLISM; SEVERITY; GENE	Objectives: Prospective cohort study to characterize the clinical features and course of spinal muscular atrophy type I (SMA-I). Methods: Patients were enrolled at 3 study sites and followed for up to 36 months with serial clinical, motor function, laboratory, and electrophysiologic outcome assessments. Intervention was determined by published standard of care guidelines. Palliative care options were offered. Results: Thirty-four of 54 eligible subjects with SMA-I (63%) enrolled and 50% of these completed at least 12 months of follow-up. The median age at reaching the combined endpoint of death or requiring at least 16 hours/day of ventilation support was 13.5 months (interquartile range 8.1-22.0 months). Requirement for nutritional support preceded that for ventilation support. The distribution of age at reaching the combined endpoint was similar for subjects with SMA-I who had symptom onset before 3 months and after 3 months of age (p = 0.58). Having 2 SMN2 copies was associated with greater morbidity and mortality than having 3 copies. Baseline electrophysiologic measures indicated substantial motor neuron loss. By comparison, subjects with SMA-II who lost sitting ability (n=10) had higher motor function, motor unit number estimate and compound motor action potential, longer survival, and later age when feeding or ventilation support was required. The mean rate of decline in The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test for Neuromuscular Disorders motor function scale was 1.27 points/year (95% confidence interval 0.21-2.33, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Infants with SMA-I can be effectively enrolled and retained in a 12-month natural history study until a majority reach the combined endpoint. These outcome data can be used for clinical trial design.	[Finkel, Richard S.; Foley, A.

J	Breton, YA; Conover, K; Shizgal, P				Breton, Yannick-Andre; Conover, Kent; Shizgal, Peter			The effect of probability discounting on reward seeking: a three-dimensional perspective	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-stimulation reward; decision-making; operant conditioning; risk; subjective probability; subjective value	BRAIN-STIMULATION REWARD; OPERANT PERFORMANCE; MATCHING LAW; RAT; ALLOCATION; MAGNITUDE; BEHAVIOR; CHOICE	Rats will work for electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle. The rewarding effect arises from the volleys of action potentials fired by the stimulation and subsequent spatio-temporal integration of their post-synpatic impact. The proportion of time allocated to self-stimulation depends on the intensity of the rewarding effect as well as on other key determinants of decision-making, such as subjective opportunity costs and reward probability. We have proposed that a 3D model relating time allocation to the intensity and cost of reward can distinguish manipulations acting prior to the output of the spatio-temporal integrator from those acting at or beyond it. Here, we test this proposition by varying reward probability, a variable that influences the computation of payoff in the 3D model downstream from the output of the integrator. On riskless trials, reward was delivered on every occasion that the rat held down the lever for a cumulative duration called the "price," whereas on risky trials, reward was delivered with probability 0.75 or 0.50. According to the model, the 3D structure relating time allocation to reward intensity and price is shifted leftward along the price axis by reductions in reward probability; the magnitude of the shift estimates the change in subjective probability. The predictions were borne out: reducing reward probability shifted the 3D structure systematically along the price axis while producing only small, inconsistent displacements along the pulse-frequency axis. The results confirm that the model can accurately distinguish manipulations acting at or beyond the spatio-temporal integrator and strengthen the conclusions of previous studies showing similar shifts following dopaminergic manipulations. Subjective and objective reward probabilities appeared indistinguishable over the range of 0.5 <= p <= 1.0.

Here we show that rat epithelial cell transformation by the human H-ras oncogene leads to an increase in production of small, exosomal-like extracellular vesicles by viable cancer cells. These EVs contain chromatin-associated double-stranded DNA fragments covering the entire host genome, including full-length H-ras. Oncogenic N-ras and SV40LT sequences were also found in EVs emitted from spontaneous mouse brain tumor cells. Disruption of acidic sphingomyelinase and the p53/Rb pathway did not block emission of EV-related oncogenic DNA. Exposure of non-transformed RAT-1 cells to EVs containing mutant H-ras DNA led to the uptake and retention of this material for an extended (30 days) but transient period of time. and stimulated cell proliferation. Thus, our study suggests that H-ras-mediated transformation stimulates vesicular emission of this histone-bound oncogene, which may interact with non-transformed cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
