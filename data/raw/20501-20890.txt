[1999a] Eur. J. Neurosci. 11:2506-2518.). This analysis was made possible by sectioning the posterior cingulate gyrus radially, i.e., in planes that were orthogonal to its line of curvature and that, therefore, preserved the laminar organization of this region. The aim of the present study was to examine the architecture and the limits of the human retrosplenial cortex. Cross sections through the entire posterior cingulate gyrus were obtained by applying the sectioning technique developed in the monkey, so that an explicit comparison could be made between the architecture of the human and the monkey retrosplenial cortex. The present analysis revealed that, as is the case in the macaque brain, the human retrosplenial cortex is composed of granular areas 29a-c and d, and dysgranular/agranular area 30. The human retrosplenial cortex, like that of the macaque monkey, runs, as an arch, around the splenium of the corpus callosum. In the macaque brain, the retrosplenial cortex remains buried within the callosal sulcus throughout its entire course around the splenium. In the human brain, however, the posteroventral segment of the retrosplenial cortex extends on the medial wall of the cerebral hemisphere to encompass most of the cortical region commonly referred to as the "isthmus of the cingulate gyrus."

Microglia, the cells responding earliest to axonal injury, produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), a cytokine with both cytopathic and neuroprotective effects. We have studied activation of hippocampal microglia to produce TNF alpha in response to transection of perforant path axons in SJL/J mice. TNF alpha mRNA was produced in a transient manner, peaking at 2 d and falling again by 5 d after lesioning. This was unlike other markers of glial reactivity, such as Mac-1 upregulation, which were sustained over longer time periods. Message for the immune cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) was undetectable, and glial reactivity to axonal lesions occurred as normal in IFN gamma-deficient mice. Microglial responses to lesion-induced neuronal injury were markedly enhanced in myelin basic protein promoter-driven transgenic mice, in which IFN gamma was endogenously produced in hippocampus. The kinetics of TNF alpha down-regulation 5 d after lesion was not affected by transgenic IFN gamma, indicating that IFN gamma acts as an amplifier and not an inducer of response. These results are discussed in the context of a regenerative role for TNF alpha in the CNS, which is innately regulated and potentiated by IFN gamma.

In this study, using immunocytochemistry, we examined neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in lumbar dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells of young adult (2-3 months old) and middle-aged (8-10 months old) rats 4 weeks after partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL). Significantly higher NPY immunoreactivity was induced in the injured side DRG neurons, the dorsal horn and the gracile nuclei in middle-aged rats than in young rats. Using combined fluorescent dye tracing and NPY immunostaining, we found in middle-aged rats that 46% injured DRG neurons projected to the gracile nucleus and 45% of injured neurons were also NPY-IR, whereas 42% spared DRG neurons projected to the gracile nucleus and 18% of spared neurons were also NPY-IR. Thus PSNL induces NPY up-regulation in spared as well as injured DRG neurons, both contribute to the increased NPY immunoreactivity in the gracile nucleus in the middle-aged rats. The more dramatic increase of NPY in DRG neurons of middle-aged rats after PSNL shows that the responses to partial nerve injury are the higher incidence of neuropathic pain in human middle age.

Intracellular recording of lumbosacral motoneurones in the decerebrate and partially spinalized cat injected with nialamide and L-dihydroxyphenlalanine (L-DOPA) was used to investigate the interneuronal convergence of two bulbospinal pathways and of the segmental pathways involved with the generation of extensor activities during locomotion. 2. Deiter's nucleus (DN) or the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) was stimulated in alternation with, anti in combination with, stimulation of group I afferents from extensor muscles or of contralateral flexor reflex afferents (coFRA). The evoked polysynaptic EPSPs were recorded in extensor motoneurones when long-latency, long-lasting discharges were evoked by the stimulation of coFRA and when the group I autogenetic inhibition in extensors tt as reversed to polysynaptic excitation. Spatial facilitation was inferred when the amplitude of the EPSPs evoked the combined stimuli was notably larger than the algebraic sum of the EPSPs evoked by individual stimulation. 3. Both DN (16 motoneurones) and MLF inputs (8 motoneurones) showed spatial facilitation when preceded by coFRA stimuli and both could reset the rhythm of fictive stepping by triggering a precocious extensor phase. MLF showed spatial facilitation with extensor group I inputs in 69 % of trials but DN failed to show spatial facilitation in any cells. 4. These results indicate that DN and MLF project to the coFRA pathways of the extensor half-centre for locomotion and MLF, but not DN, converge on segmental interneurones of the extensor group I pathways. The implications of such convergence patterns on the functional organization of the extensor half-centre are discussed.

J	McLeod, AL; Krause, JE; Ribeiro-Da-Silva, A				McLeod, AL; Krause, JE; Ribeiro-Da-Silva, A			Immunocytochemical localization of neurokinin B in the rat spinal dorsal horn and its association with substance P and GABA: An electron microscopic study	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						tachykinin; spinal cord; nociception; ultrastructure	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PRIMARY AFFERENT TERMINALS; LAMINAE-I-III; PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS; MESSENGER-RNAS; INSITU HYBRIDIZATION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; CORD; PRECURSOR; GLOMERULI	Substance P and neurokinin B are tachykinins that derive from different precursors. Both tachykinins are known to be involved in the processing of pain-related information. Initial studies suggested an antinociceptive effect for neurokinin B, but more recent data indicate that neurokinin B facilitates nociception. Unfortunately, morphologic correlates are lacking, as little is known about the distribution of neurokinin B, especially at the ultrastructural level. Because of its potentially important role in the processing of pain-related information, we decided to investigate the synaptic interactions of neurokinin B-immunoreactive profiles in laminae I-III of the rat cervical spinal dorsal horn and their relation to substance P-immunoreactive structures. An antibody raised against a portion of the neurokinin B precursor peptide was used for the detection of neurokinin B. Neurokinin B-Like immunoreactivity occurred in all superficial laminae, with the highest density in inner lamina II: and the lowest in lamina III. Neurokinin B-like immunoreactive axonal boutons were mainly dome-shaped and established symmetric synaptic contacts with dendrites or cell bodies. Neurokinin B-like immunoreactivity was also detected in dendritic profiles in all superficial laminae. Some of these dendritic profiles were part of synaptic glomeruli in inner lamina IE and lamina III. Double-labeling for neurokinin B and substance P showed a lack of appositions and synapses between neurokinin B and substance P-positive profiles. Furthermore, very few profiles double-labeled for the two peptides were observed. Double-labeling for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and neurokinin B showed a complete absence of neurokinin B/GABA co-localization. Furthermore, neuroldnin B-positive profiles were never presynaptic to GABA-immunoreactive profiles, but frequently neurokinin B-positive dendrites were postsynaptic to GABA-immunoreactive boutons. These results suggest that neurokinin B participates in circuits separate from those involving substance P, as virtually no anatomic correlation was found between the two neuropeptides. J. Comp.

Spherons are regular large A beta-domain containing intraneuronal protein masses, in the normal gray matter. We investigated biochemical, cell biological, and immunological aspects of the link between spherons and SP. Spherons were extracted from samples of human brain obtained at autopsy and studied for amyloid content by immunolabelling and by Western blots from electrophoretic gels. The transformation of intact spherons to fibrillized beta-pleated sheet deposits was studied by transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The degree of spheron protein racemization was measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Spherons were found to be immunopositive for A beta and APP, and to demonstrate fibrillogenesis similar to SP. Enantiomeric analysis showed spheron chiral content closely similar to SP, with spheron protein on average 20-40 years old, consistent with gradual protein accumulation over the lifetime of the individual. These findings suggest that the highly racemized fibrillogenic spheron is an intracellularly sequestered long-lived insoluble stable source of intact A beta domain, and support the possible link between spherons and SP.

Design: This was a retrospective study of 269 individuals with stroke who completed visual-perception testing and an on-road driving evaluation. Driving evaluators from six evaluation sites in Canada and the United States participated. Visual-perception was assessed using the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test. Scores range from 0 to 36, with a higher score indicating better visual perception. A structured on-road driving evaluation was performed to determine fitness to drive. Based on driving behaviors, a pass or fail outcome was determined by the examiner. Results: The results indicated that, using a score on the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test of less than or equal to 30 to indicate poor visual-perception and >30 to indicate good visual perception, the positive predictive value of the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test in identifying those who would fail the on-road test was 60.9% (n = 67/110). The corresponding negative predictive value was 64.2% (n = 102/159). Univariate logistic regression analyses revealed that older age, low Motor-Free Visual Perception Test scores and a right hemisphere lesion contributed significantly to identifying those who failed the on-road test. Conclusions: The predictive validity of the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test is not sufficiently high to warrant its use as the sole screening tool in identifying those who are unfit to undergo an on-road evaluation.

The disease is accompanied by hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and elevated levels of phenylalanine metabolites (phenylacetate (PAA), phenyllactate (PLA), and phenylpyruvate (PPA)) in body fluids, Here we describe a method to determine the concentrations of PAA, PPA, and PLA in the brain of normal and mutant orthologous mice, the latter being models of human PKU and non-PKU HPA. Stable isotope dilution techniques are employed with the use of [H-2(5)]-phenylacetic acid and [2,3,3-H-2(3)]-3-phenyllactic acid as internal standards. Negative ion chemical ionization (NICI)-GC/MS analyses are performed on the pentafluorobenzyl ester derivatives formed in situ in brain homogenates. Unstable PPA in the homogenate is reduced by (NaBH4)-H-2 to stable PLA, which is labeled with a single deuterium and discriminated from endogenous PLA in the mass spectrometer on that basis. The method demonstrates that these metabolites are easily measured in normal mouse brain and are elevated moderately in HPA mice and greatly in PKU mice. However, their concentrations are not sufficient in PKU to be "toxic"; phenylalanine itself remains the chemical candidate causing impaired cognitive development. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The deficiency of saposins B and C results in variant forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy and Gaucher's disease, respectively, which are characterized by lysosomal storage of undegraded glycosphingolipids. Tn the nervous system, prosaposin presents trophic activity. A mouse model was recently developed by creating a null allele in embryonic stem cells through gene targeting to investigate the phenotypic diversity of prosaposin mutations and the involvement of this protein in lysosomal storage diseases, and for the development of therapeutic approaches. Mice homozygous mutants die at the age of 35-40 days and neurological disorders contribute to the early demise of the mutant mice. The male reproductive organs in homozygous mutants show several abnormalities, such as a decrease in testis size with reduced spermiogenesis and an involution of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis. In these animals, the blood levels of testosterone remain normal. In the prostate of homozygous mutants, only the basal epithelial cells appear to be present, while the secretory cells are absent. These findings suggest that prosaposin may be involved in the development and maintenance of the male reproductive organs, as well as, in cellular differentiation.

Specifically, we assessed whether a significant relationship exists between violence and hospitalization for a major mental disorder, and whether this relationship differs for schizophrenia, affective psychoses and organic brain syndromes. Methods: Subjects were drawn from a birth cohort of all individuals born between January 1, 1933, and December 31, 1947, in Denmark (N = 358 180). Because of the existence of accurate and complete national registers, data were available on all arrests for violence and all hospitalizations for mental illness that occurred for individuals in this cohort through the age of 44 years. Results: There was a significant positive relationship between the major mental disorders that led to hospitalization and criminal violence (odds: ratios 2.0-8.8 for men and 3.9-23.2 for women). Persons hospitalized for a major mental disorder were responsible for a disproportionate percentage of violence committed by the members of the birth cohort. Men with organic psychoses and both men and women with schizophrenia were significantly more likely to be arrested For criminal violence than were persons who had never been hospitalized, even when controlling for demographic factors, substance abuse, and personality disorders. Conclusions: Individuals hospitalized for schizophrenia and men hospitalized with organic psychosis have higher rates of arrests for violence than those never hospitalized. This relationship cannot be fully explained by demographic factors or comorbid substance abuse.

The MMN can be elicited by many kinds of stimulus change, varying from simple changes in a single stimulus feature to abstract changes in the relationship between stimuli. The main intracerebral sources for the MMN are located in the auditory cortices of the temporal robe. Since it occurs whether or not stimuli are being attended, the MMN represents an automatic cerebral process for detecting change. The MMN is clinically helpful in terms of demonstrating disordered sensory processing or disordered memory in groups of patients. Improvements in the techniques for measuring the MMN and in the paradigms for eliciting it will be needed before the MMN can become clinically useful as an objective measurement of such disorders in individual patients.

J	Bernard-Bonnin, AC				Bernard-Bonnin, AC			Diurnal enuresis in childhood	CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN			English	Article							URINARY-TRACT INFECTION; VESICOURETERAL REFLUX; CHILDREN; BLADDER; DYSFUNCTION; INCONTINENCE; MANAGEMENT	OBJECTIVE To review the clinical classification of childhood diurnal enuresis, to describe the evaluation process, and to discuss principles of management. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE An extensive literature review was performed with a MEDLINE search. Articles were selected according to date of publication, clinical relevance, and availability. Recent articles, cohort studies of at least 50 patients, and randomized clinical trials were preferred. Recent editions of classic textbooks were consulted. Evaluation and management activities discussed in this article are supported by original and relevant literature. MAIN MESSAGE Most causes of childhood diurnal enuresis can be determined by a thorough history coupled with a complete physical examination and urinalysis and culture. Supplementary investigations include ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder to screen for neurogenic bladder and urethral obstruction. When obstruction, ectopic ureter, or bladder dysfunction is suspected, voiding cystourethrography and urodynamic studies are needed. Evaluation of neurogenic bladder includes magnetic resonance imaging of the spine. Treatment is aimed at correcting poor: toilet habits, preventing or treating urinary tract infections, and using appropriate medication. CONCLUSIONS In most instances, diurnal enuresis in childhood is a benign condition with an easily identifiable cause and an excellent prognosis with time and appropriate treatment.

It is necessary to understand which lesions are epileptogenic, and if they are indeed responsible for the generation of seizures. In addition to localizing seizure onset, the functional and eloquent areas of the brain need to be identified. As in many other centres, we perform resective surgeries on the basis of combined information derived from seizure semiology, EEG abnormalities, neuroimaging and other tests of cerebral function. If surface EEG recording yields inconclusive or ambiguous results, then invasive intracranial techniques using intracerebral depth or subdural electrodes can be used to improve diagnostic or prognostic accuracy. The indications, principles, results and complications of these recording techniques based on extensive experience at two epilepsy surgery centres are reviewed.

Cognitive functions sampled typically include "intelligence" (IQ tests), attention, language skills, visuospatial abilities, "executive skills" and other abilities associated with frontal-lobe function, and learning and memory. Thus, the assessment samples vary widely among a variety of functions, providing a comprehensive picture of an individual's strengths and weaknesses. The resulting pattern points to the probable site of epileptic focus. Neuropsychological findings also serve to predict the risk for postsurgical cognitive decline and, when performance before and after operation is compared, they provide data on the impact of surgery upon cognitive functioning. Comprehensive evaluation of learning and memory is particularly important in this context, because of the frequency of temporal lobe epilepsy and the prominence of memory dysfunction associated with it. In addition, patients slated for elective surgery may also undergo an intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP), which is performed to determine the side of cerebral dominance for language and to test the memory capabilities of each hemisphere alone. All of these specialized neuropsychological tools are discussed in this paper.

This is the rationale for a transcortical selective approach, first introduced by Niemeyer, for removal of the hippocampus and amygdala. Series from a number of centers have demonstrated the efficacy of selective amygdalohippocampectomy compared to a more traditional resection. The technique described here and used at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) utilizes a strictly endopial resection of the hippocampal formation and amygdala in addition to computer image guidance to perform the procedure. Ninety-five percent of patients at the MNI who underwent selective amygdalohippocampectomy realized a cessation of seizures, or greater than 90% reduction, with minimal risk of complications.

Auras, when present, may be very suggestive of temporal lobe onset and may further localize to a mesiobasal or lateral temporal lobe site of onset. During the ictus, automatisms and motor phenomena may be highly indicative of temporal lobe seizure activity and may even help lateralize the discharge. In the post-ictal period, motor paresis and aphasia are helpful in lateralization. Video E.E.G. data has provided extensive information on the utility of ictal symptomatology in seizure localization. Thus, the seizure semiology provides important adjunctive information in evaluating patients for epilepsy surgery and should be concordant with information obtained from ictal EEG, neuroimaging and neuropsychology.

In the present study, we demonstrate that low-micromolar concentrations of amyloid(1-40) (A40) and amyloid(1-42) (A42), peptides implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, increase levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA and protein in cultured rat astroglia, Furthermore, 6 days of exposure to amyloid augments the sequestration of (FeCl3)-Fe-55-derived iron by astroglial mitochondria without affecting the disposition of this metal in whole-cell and lysosomal compartments. Mitochondrial iron deposition was not observed in the amyloid-treated glia when diferric-transferrin served as the metal donor. We had previously shown that inhibitors of HO-1 and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP) block the uptake of mitochondrial iron in astrocytes exposed to the pro-oxidant effects of dopamine and several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, in the current study, amyloid-induced mitochondrial iron trapping was significantly attenuated by co-administration of the HO-1 transcriptional suppressor, dexamethasone (DEX) or the MTP blocker, cyclosporin A (CSA). Thus, the marked enhancement of HO-1 expression previously demonstrated in AD-affected neurons and astroglia may transduce amyloid (oxidative) stress into the abnormal patterns of iron deposition and mitochondrial insufficiency characteristic of this disease. Finally, in experiments employing cytotoxic concentrations of A40, we provide evidence that inhibition of HO-1 transcription and related mitochondrial iron deposition may be an important mechanism by which DEX protects tissues subjected to amyloid stress.

This study was undertaken to attempt a replication and quantification of these observations using functional magnetic resonance imaging. V5 was significantly activated in 19 hemispheres with alternating, low contrast, random checkerboard patterns. We confirmed the stereotaxic location of V5 and were able to describe a fairly consistent sulcal pattern in the parieto-temporo-occipital cortex. V5 was usually (95%) buried within a sulcus, most commonly within the inferior temporal sulcus (ITS) (11%), the ascending limb of the ITS (ALITS) (53%) and the posterior continuation of the ITS (26%). The average distance from V5 of two identified anatomical landmarks of V5, the junctions of the LO and the ALITS, and the ITS and ALITS, were both similar to 1 cm. However, the LO-ALITS junction often had to be determined by interpolation (47%), and was not always present even with interpolation (21%). In contrast, the ITS-ALITS junction was always present and V5 was usually (90%) located in a sulcus intersecting with this junction, making it a more reliable landmark for localizing V5 with respect to gross morphological features on individual cortical surfaces.

Methods: We assume that the scalp EEG can be modelled by a small number of current dipoles of fixed location and orientation, placed at regions of interest. The algorithm is based on weighted linear spatial decomposition in order to obtain a weighted solution to the inverse problem. An EEG data matrix is first weighted in favour of a single dipole in the set. The dipole moment is then calculated from the weighted EEG by the pseudo-inverse method. This is repeated for each dipole. Results: Six seizures were processed from 4 patients using the standard least-squares solution and our weighted version. The average cross-correlation between channels was calculated for each case. The first method resulted in a mean drop in cross-correlation of 16.5% from that of the scalp. Our method resulted in a reduction of 34.5%. Conclusions: Our method gives a more spatially decorrelated signal in regions of interest (although it is not intended as an accurate localization tool). Subsequent analysis is more robust and less likely to be dependent on specific recording montages. This is more than could be obtained using a standard least-squares solution using the same model.

Infarction in the territory of the RAH represents a specific stroke syndrome not yet described in infancy with a range of motor and functional manifestations. An infant is described with apparent congenital infarction of the recurrent artery of Heubner. The child had prominent involvement of the contralateral upper extremity with athetosis. Neuroimaging changes were evident in the vascular territory classically attributed to the RAH. The clinician should suspect congenital RAH infarction in those infants with congenital upper-extremity athetosis.

Here we studied the role of the septum in stress-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Rats were trained to self-administer heroin for 9-10 days (three 3-h sessions per day, 0.1 mg/kg per infusion). Following training, extinction sessions were given for 8-13 days by substituting saline for heroin, and then tests for reinstatement of heroin seeking were carried out. Reversible inactivation of the medial septum with tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1-5 ng, infused 25-40 min before the test sessions) reliably reinstated heroin seeking, mimicking the effect of 15 min of intermittent footshock. This effect of TTX was not observed after infusions made 1.5 mm dorsally into the lateral septum. In other experiments, it was found that infusions of a low, subthreshold dose of TTX (0.5 ng) into the medial septum, when combined with 2 min of footshock that in itself was ineffective, reinstated heroin seeking. Furthermore, electrical stimulation (400 mu A pulses, 100 mu s duration, 100 Hz frequency) of the medial septum during exposure to 10 min of intermittent footshock attenuated footshock-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. These data suggest a role for the medial septum in stress-induced relapse to drug seeking. The septum is thought to be involved in neuronal processes underlying behavioural inhibition, thus we speculate that stressors provoke relapse by interfering with these processes.

Sensitivity was tested in normal, lesioned (areas 17-18) and split-chiasm cats using a kinematogram, as well as a textured bar drifting on a uniform light background and a light bar drifting on a stationary textured background. Texture density was varied. The results indicate that almost all cells of area 19 recorded in the three groups of cats responded to a motion-defined bar or to its edges. Texture density influenced the responses in that the discharge rate increased as density decreased. However, the majority of cells were sensitive to the highest texture density kinematogram. Moreover, the neural responses of all cats were either independent of the density of the textured bar or background, or were modulated by it. These results show that cells in area 19 can signal the presence of a kinetic bar and that the density of either the textured bar, the background or both can influence figure-ground detection. The results are interpreted with respect to how various inputs influence the function of area 19.

The present studies were undertaken to determine whether the mirtazapine-paroxetine combination could induce an earlier and/or a greater effect on the 5-HT system than either drug alone. Using in vivo electrophysiological paradigms, the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was decreased by 70% in rats treated with paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.) for 2 days and was back to normal after 21 days. In contrast, a 2-day treatment with mirtazapine (5 mg/kg/day, s.c.) did not alter the firing of 5-HT neurons whereas it was increased by 60% after 21 days of treatment. A low dose of mirtazapine (5 mg/kg/day, s.c.x2 days) failed to offset the decremental effect of paroxetine on the 5-HT neuron firing activity, bur a higher dose (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.x2 days) did attenuate the decremental effect of paroxetine. In the dorsal hippocampus, neither mirtazapine (5 mg/kg/day, s.c.) nor a paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.) treatment altered the responsiveness of 5-MT1A receptors to microiontophoretically-applied 5-HT. Both in controls and in rats treated for 2 days with paroxetine alone, the administration of the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 (25-100 mu g/kg, i.v.) did not change the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons. However, WAY 100635 increased significantly the firing activity of these neurons in rats treated with mirtazapine atone but to a greater extent with both mirtazapine and paroxetine for 2 days. After 21 days of treatment, WAY 100635 increased to a greater degree the firing rate of CA(3) pyramidal neurons in rats which received the combination over rats given either drug alone. It is concluded that the mirtazapine-paroxetine combination shortened the delay in enhancing the tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors and produced a greater activation of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors than either drug given alone. The present results suggested that mirtazapine may have a faster onset of action than a SSRI, and that the co-administration of mirtazapine and paroxetine may accelerate the antidepressant response and as well as being more effective than either drug alone.

Finger tremor was examined in nine patients undergoing unilateral VL thalamotomy and in nine age-matched controls. In comparison to the preoperative state, the relative percentage of power within the 7.6-12.5 Hz band did not increase after the surgical procedure. Furthermore, the amount of absolute power within the 7.6-12.5 Hz band was much lower for pest-surgical patients in comparison to matched controls when periods of tremor having equal amplitudes were compared. These results suggest that VL thalamotomy interrupts a common circuit involved in the supraspinal component of both physiological and pathological tremors. We provide evidence that the thalamus may be involved in circuits generating physiological tremor in humans.

Lineaments are mapped into remotely sensed satellite images as long and continuous quasilinear features and can be described as a connected sequence of edgels whose direction may change gradually along the sequence. Parts of the same lineament can be occluded by geomorphological features and must be linked together, a major drawback with local and small neighborhood detectors. We propose a cellular neural network (CNN) architecture to offer a large directional neighborhood to the lineament detection algorithm. The CNN uses a large circular neighborhood coupled with a directional-induced gradient field to link together edgels with similar and continuous orientation. Missing edgels are restored if a surrounding lineament is detected.

The neural network can be interpreted as a graphical model without hidden random variables, but in which the conditional distributions are tied through the hidden units. The connectivity of the neural network can be pruned by using dependency tests between the variables (thus reducing significantly the number of parameters). Experiments on modeling the distribution of several discrete data sets show statistically significant improvements over other methods such as naive Bayes and comparable Bayesian networks and show that significant improvements can be obtained by pruning the network.

Methods and Materials: Adults with cerebral or cerebellar solitary non-brainstem tumors less than or equal to 40 mm in maximum diameter were eligible. Initial radiosurgical doses were 18 Gy for tumors less than or equal to 20 mm, 15 Gy for those 2130 mm, and 12 Gy for those 31-40 mm in maximum diameter. Dose was prescribed to the 50-90% isodose line. Doses were escalated in 3 Gy increments providing the incidence of irreversible grade 3 (severe) or any grade 4 (life threatening) or grade 5 (fatal) Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (unacceptable CNS toxicity) was < 20% within 3 months of radiosurgery. Chronic CNS toxicity was also assessed. Results: Between 1990-1994, 156 analyzable patients were entered, 36% of whom had recurrent primary brain tumors (median prior dose 60 Gy) and 64% recurrent brain metastases (median prior dose 30 Gy). The maximum tolerated doses were 24 Gy, 18 Gy, and 15 Gy for tumors less than or equal to 20 mm, 2130 mm, and 31-40 mm in maximum diameter, respectively. However, for tumors < 20 mm, investigators' reluctance to escalate to 27 Gy, rather than excessive toxicity, determined the maximum tolerated dose. In a multivariate analysis, maximum tumor diameter was one variable associated with a significantly increased risk of grade 3, 4, or 5 neurotoxicity. Tumors 21-40 mm were 7.3 to 16 times more likely to develop grade 36 neurotoxicity compared to tumors < 20 mm. Other variables significantly associated with grade 3-5 neurotoxicity were tumor dose and Karnofsky Performance Status. The actuarial incidence of radionecrosis was 5%, 8%, 9%, and 11% at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following radiosurgery, respectively. Forty-eight percent of patients developed tumor progression within the radiosurgical target volume. A multivariate analysis revealed two variables that were significantly associated with an increased risk of local progression, i.e. progression in the radiosurgical target volume. Patients with primary brain tumors (versus brain metastases) had a 2.85 greater risk of local progression. Those treated on a linear accelerator (versus the Gamma Knife) had a 2.84 greater risk of local progression. Of note, 61 % of Gamma Knife treated patients had recurrent primary brain tumors compared to 30% of patients treated with a linear accelerator. Conclusions: The maximum tolerated doses of single fraction radiosurgery were defined for this population of patients as 24 Gy, 18 Gy, and 15 Gy for tumors less than or equal to 20 mm, 2130 mm, and 31-40 mm in maximum diameter. Unacceptable CNS toxicity was more likely in patients with larger tumors, whereas local tumor control was most dependent on the type of recurrent tumor and the treatment unit.

In this study, carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) and a 67-kd subunit of Neurospora crassa vacuolar proton adenosinetriphosphatase (H+V-ATPase) pump were immunolocalized using light microscopy and electron microscopy (EM) in the epididymis of rats and mice. In both animals, narrow cells, identified in the initial segment and intermediate zone of the epididymis, contained numerous small vesicles in their apical region, often cup-shaped in appearance. In the mouse but not rat, these cells also possessed numerous cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting steroid synthesis; and cytoplasmic blebs of their apical cell surface, which appeared to detach, suggesting apocrine secretion. Anti-CA II antibody was immunocytochemically localized in the light microscope within narrow cells but not over any other cell types of the entire epididymis. Anti-H+V-ATPase antibody was also localized in narrow cells of the initial segment and intermediate zone; as well as clear cells of the caput, corpus, and cauda regions. Using EM, gold particles for anti-CA II and H+V-ATPase antibodies were noted in the apical region of narrow cells in relation to the numerous, small, cup-shaped vesicles. Although CA II was mainly located in the cytosol near these vesicles, H+V-ATPase appeared on their delimiting membrane and on the apical plasma membrane of these cells. A similar distribution was noted for H+V-ATPase in clear cells. The nature of the small vesicles of the apical region of narrow cells was examined with electron-dense fluid phase tracers that were introduced into the epididymal lumen. The tracers appeared within these vesicles and a few endosomes 1 hour after injection, suggesting that they contact the apical plasma membrane. Since these vesicles are also related to CA II and H+V-ATPase, the data suggests that, as the site of proton production, the vesicles recycle to and from the apical cell surface, and in this way, deliver protons to the epididymal lumen for acidification. Clear cells and their expression of H+V-ATPase may also serve in this function. In summary, both narrow and clear cells appear to be involved in luminal acidification, an activity that may be essential for sperm as they traverse and are stored in the epididymis.

Methods: A survey instrument consisting of 19 open- and closed-ended questions was sent to United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG)- and Pediatric Oncology Group (POG)-affiliated pediatricians. Results: fifty-three UKCCSG- and 78 FOG-affiliated pediatricians responded. Thirty-two UKCCSG and 51 FOG respondents had previously entered at least one child into a phase I study. Overall, respondents believed that parents entered their children for medical benefit altruism, and hope of cure. Although many respondents believed that children could benefit from medical improvement, feelings of altruism, and maintenance of hope, the chance of cure or complete remission was thought to be small. Similarly, parents were thought to potentially benefit through altruism and maintenance of hope, Whereas 83% of UKCCSG respondents indicated that phase I trials were associated with ethical difficulties, this was a concern for 48% of FOG respondents. The main ethical concerns of respondents were risk of toxicity, consent of the child, unrealistic hope, and coercion. Conclusion: The respondents in this survey expressed mainly ethical concerns regarding the conduct of phase I trials and had realistic expectations of the potential far toxicity and benefit for those children who participate in these studies.

Glycosylation of the core protein of alpha-DG; is extensive, variable from tissue to tissue, and functionally relevant. To address differential glycosylation of alpha-DG in the retina, we have investigated the distribution of this protein using two different antibodies: 1B7 directed against the core protein of alpha-dystroglycan, and IIH6 directed against a carbohydrate moiety (Ervasti and Campbell [1993] J Cell Biol 122:809-823). Monoclonal antibody 1B7 recognizes a broader band than IIH6, which seems to recognize only a subset of alpha-DG forms in retina. These data reflect the existence of differentially glycosylated isoforms of alpha-DG. Monoclonal antibody 1B7 shows an extensive staining for alpha-DG in the inner limiting membrane as well as in the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers labeling Muller cell processes, whereas monoclonal antibody IIH6 staining is restricted to the inner limiting membrane and blood vessels. Our data indicate that there are distinct isoforms of alpha-DG that are localized in apposition to basal lamina in the inner limiting membrane and blood vessels or within the parenchyma of the retina along Muller glia. Both isoforms are expressed in a Muller cell line in culture and coimmunoprecipitate with beta-dystroglycan. These data suggest that DGs may participate in organizing synapses and basement membrane assembly in the retina. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Currier, NL; Sun, LZY; Miller, SC				Currier, NL; Sun, LZY; Miller, SC			Exogenous melatonin: quantitative enhancement in vivo of cells mediating non-specific immunity	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						hemopoiesis; melatonin; monocytes; NK cells	PINEAL HORMONE MELATONIN; NATURAL-KILLER-CELLS; LOW-DOSE INTERLEUKIN-2; MOUSE BONE-MARROW; NEUROHORMONE MELATONIN; HEMATOPOIETIC SYSTEM; RECOMBINANT HUMAN; CANCER-PATIENTS; LYMPHOCYTES-T; AGING MICE	Melatonin (MLT), a biogenic indoleamine and neuromodulator produced by the pineal gland, is known to activate T helper cells by means of direct binding to melatonin receptors on both Th1 and Th2 cells. The present in vivo study aimed to investigate the effect of exogenously administered MLT on the hemopoietic and immune cell populations of the bone marrow and spleen in healthy, young adult male mice at two distinct MLT exposure intervals. The neurohormone, administered daily through the diet (7-14 days), was homogenized into finely ground chow. Control mice received ground chow without MLT. The results revealed cell lineage-specific, quantitative, MLT exposure-time-dependent changes in both the bone marrow and spleen. NK cells and monocytes (both components of the non-specific immune system functioning as the first line of defense against neoplasia and virus infected cells) were significantly increased in the bone marrow by both 7 and 14 days of dietary melatonin. The quantitative increment in these two cell populations, in the organ of their production, i.e. the bone marrow, indicates that new cell proliferation/production may have been stimulated by MLT. In the spleen, as in the bone marrow, NK cell levels remained significantly elevated at both 7 and 14 days after melatonin exposure. However, the number of monocytes in the spleen did not maintain, at day 14 of MLT exposure, the high levels observed after 7 days of MLT, in spite of their sustained, high numbers at 14 days in the bone marrow. This suggests that the progeny of the apparently increased monocyte production in the bone marrow (elevated absolute numbers therein), had localized in anatomical sites (other than the spleen) also common to these cells. Thus, the selective, positive influences of in vivo administered, exogenous melatonin on cells mediating non-specific immunity suggests a plausible mechanism for numerous claims that it is responsible for tumor amelioration in patients.

A characteristic feature of the stellate cells (SCs) of entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II, those neurons giving rise to the main component of the perforant path input to the hippocampal formation, is their ability to generate persistent, Na+-dependent rhythmic subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, which are thought to be instrumental in implementing theta rhythmicity in the entorhinal-hippocampal network. The SCs also display a robust time-dependent inward rectification in the hyperpolarizing direction that may contribute to the generation of these oscillations. We performed whole cell recordings of SCs in in vitro slices to investigate the specific biophysical and pharmacological properties of the current underlying this inward rectification and to clarify its potential role in the genesis of the subthreshold oscillations. In voltage-clamp conditions, hyperpolarizing voltage steps evoked a slow, noninactivating inward current, which also deactivated slowly on depolarization. This current was identified as I-h because it was resistant to extracellular Ba2+, sensitive to Cs+, completely and selectively abolished by ZD7288, and carried by both Na+ and K+ ions. I-h in the SCs had an activation threshold and reversal potential at approximately -45 and -20 mV, respectively. Its half-activation voltage was -77 mV. Importantly, bath perfusion with ZD7288, but not Ba2+ gradually and completely abolished the subthreshold oscillations, thus directly implicating I-h in their generation. Using experimentally derived biophysical parameters for I-h and the low-threshold persistent Na+ current (I-NaP) present in the SCs, a simplified model of these neurons was constructed and their subthreshold electroresponsiveness simulated. This indicated that the interplay between I-NaP and I-h can sustain persistent subthreshold oscillations in SCs. I-NaP and I-h operate in a "push-pull" fashion where the delay in the activation/deactivation of I-h gives rise to the oscillatory process.

J	Gross, DW; Merlet, I; Boling, W; Gotman, J				Gross, DW; Merlet, I; Boling, W; Gotman, J			Relationships between the epileptic focus and hand area in central epilepsy: combining dipole models and anatomical landmarks	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						epilepsy; dipole modeling; central sulcus; cortical localization; somatosensory evoked potential; interictal spike	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN ANATOMY; HEAD MODEL; LOCALIZATION; EEG; STIMULATION; RELIABILITY; SOMATOTOPY; TOMOGRAPHY	Object. When considering resection of epileptic generators near the central sulcus, it is essential to define the spatial relationship between the epileptic generator and the primary sensorimotor hand area. In this study, the authors assessed the accuracy of dipole modeling of electroencephalographic spikes and median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in defining this relationship preoperatively and noninvasively. Methods. Epileptic spikes and SSEPs in patients with focal central area epilepsy were represented by dipole models coregistered onto global magnetic resonance images. In patients who underwent surgery, spike dipoles were also compared with findings of electrocorticography (ECoG) and with the resection area. To improve the accuracy of the dipole models, anatomical landmarks of the hand area were used to assess the error in SSEP dipole location, and this error measure was used to correct the location of spike dipoles. Five patients with central epilepsy were studied, three of whom underwent ECoG-guided surgical resections. The location of SSEP dipoles correlated well with anatomical landmarks of the primary sensory hand area. The relative position of the spike and SSEP dipoles correlated well with the patients' ictal symptoms, ECoG findings, and the location of the epileptic focus las defined by the resection cavity in patients who became seizure free postoperatively). Corrected spike dipoles were located even closer to the resection cavity. Conclusions. The calculation of the relative location of spike and SSEP dipoles is a simple noninvasive method of determining the relationship between the primary hand area and an epileptic focus in the central area. The spatial resolution of this technique can be further improved using easily identifiable anatomical landmarks.

The results indicate that GDNF promotes survival of stored dopaminergic cells. Cells stored without GDNF had a 30.1% decrease in survival time compared with those exposed to GDNF. Two patients with Parkinson's disease received bilateral putaminal implants of fetal dopaminergic cells exposed to GDNF for 6 days and showed enhancement of graft survival as assessed by positron emission tomography scanning. A mean increase of 107% in putaminal fluoro-dopa uptake from baseline values was observed 12 months postgrafting.

Several recent studies of patients with multiple sclerosis and other white matter disorders have shown both transient and sustained decreases in N-acetylaspartate in white matter lesions and in brain regions appearing normal on conventional MRI. These data have emphasised that a substantial amount of axonal damage or loss (presumably secondary to myelin pathology) is consistently present in most of these disorders. Recent post-mortem studies support these results. In contrast to changes seen with conventional MR imaging, decreases in N-acetylaspartate have shown a close correlation with changes in neurological status. This suggests that axonal damage may be more relevant than demyelination for determining chronic functional impairments in primary white matter diseases, Thus, serial measurement of brain N-acetylaspartate with proton MR spectroscopy can provide a reliable and clinically-relevant monitor of disease evolution. As pathological changes responsible for long-term morbidity are logically important targets for therapeutic agents, early treatment directed at axonal protection should be useful in these disorders.

This protocol enhances the S/N gains obtained with conventional switched protocols by combining task switching and the use of a large bolus of blood free of tracer (cold bolus). The cold bolus is formed by sequestering blood in the lower limbs with a double cuff before tracer injection. Methods: The effect of a combined cold-bolus, switched protocol on the signal from activation images was first simulated using a compartmental model of the uptake of (H2O)-O-15 into the brain. Then, the effectiveness of the protocol was investigated in 4 healthy volunteers performing a language task. Each volunteer underwent scanning 12 times: 3 activation/baseline and 3 baseline/activation scans using the conventional switched protocol and 3 activation/baseline and 3 baseline/activation scans using the combined cold-bolus, switched protocol. The S/N changes introduced when using the cold bolus were analyzed by comparing, across protocols, the magnitude and statistical significance of the activation foci associated with the execution of the language task identified in the averaged subtracted images, and by comparing image noise levels. Results: In the simulated datasets, the combined protocol yielded a substantial increase in the activation signals for scan durations greater than 60 s, in comparison with equivalent signals yielded by the switched protocol alone. In the PET experiments, activation foci obtained using the combined protocol had significantly higher t statistic values than did equivalent foci detected using the conventional switched protocol (mean improvement, 36%). Analysis of the S/N in the averaged subtracted images revealed that the improvements in statistical significance of the activation foci were caused by increases in the signal magnitudes and not by decreases in overall image noise. Conclusion: We designed a data acquisition protocol for (H2O)-O-15 bolus PET activation studies that combines the use of a tracer-free bolus with a switched protocol. Simulated and experimental data suggest that this combined protocol enhances the S/N gains obtained with a conventional switched protocol. Implementation of the combined protocol in (H2O)-O-15 bolus activation studies was easy.

We report the results of neurodevelopmental follow-up of infants enrolled in the NINOS trial. Methods: Hypoxic infants greater than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation and <14 days of age were randomized to 20 ppm INO or 100% oxygen as control. Comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment of survivors occurred at 18 to 24 months of age. Results: A total of 235 infants were enrolled in the original trial. There were 36 deaths, 20 of 121 infants in the control group and 16 of 114 infants in the INO-treated group. Of the 199 surviving infants, 173 (86.9%) were seen for follow-up (88 members of the control group and 85 members of the INO-treated group), and 135 infants were normal (69 [79.3%] members of the control group and 66 [77.6%] members of the INO-treated group). Twenty-two infants had sensorineural hearing loss (12 members of the control group and 10 members of the INO-treated group). Moderate to severe cerebral palsy occurred in 13 infants (7 infants in the control group and 6 infants in the INO-treated group). Mental developmental index scores (87 +/- 18.7 in the control group vs 85 +/- 21.7 in the INO-treated group) and psychomotor developmental index scores (93.6 +/- 17.5 in the control group vs 85.7 +/- 21.2 in the INO-treated group) were not different. A total of 29.6% of the control group compared with 34.5% of the INO-treated group had at least one disability. Infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, enrolled in a separate but parallel trial, had similar outcomes with a higher incidence of sensorineural hearing loss. Conclusion: Inhaled nitric oxide is not associated with an increase in neurodevelopmental, behavioral, or medical abnormalities at 2 years of age.

In this study, we tested whether gb1a or gb2 subunits when coexpressed with truncated receptors or metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR4 could form functional GABA receptors. Coexpression of the ligand binding N-terminal domain of gb1a or the C-terminal portion of gb1a composing the seven-transmembrane segments and intracellular loops with gb2 could not reconstitute functional receptors. We next examined whether mGluR4, which forms homodimers and is structurally related to GABA(B), could act as a surrogate coreceptor for gb1 or gb2. The coexpression of mGluR4 and gb1a led to the expression of gb1a monomers on cell surface membranes as determined by immunoblot analysis and flow cytometry. However, mGluR4-gb1a heterodimers were not formed, and membrane-expressed gb1a monomers were not functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase in human embryonic kidney 293 cells or activated inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in Xenopus oocytes. Similarly, the coexpression of mGluR4 and gb2 led to nonfunctional GABA receptors. GABA-activated distal signaling events resulted only after the coexpression and heterodimerization of gb1 and gb2. Taken together with the truncated receptor studies, the data suggest that a high degree of structural specificity is required to form the functional GABA(B) receptor that is a gb1-gb2 heterodimer.

In Drosophila, Groucho acts together with bHLH proteins of the Hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) family to negatively regulate neuronal differentiation. Loss of the functions of Groucho or HES proteins results in supernumerary central and peripheral neurons. This suggests that mammalian TLE/Groucho family members may also be involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation. Consistent with this possibility, TLE1 is expressed in proliferating neural progenitor cells of the central nervous system, but its expression is transiently down-regulated in newly generated postmitotic neurons. Based on these observations, we investigated whether persistent TLE1 expression in postmitotic neurons would perturb the normal course of neuronal development. Transgenic mice were derived in which the human TLE1 gene is regulated by the promoter of the T alpha 1 alpha-tubulin gene, which is exclusively expressed in postmitotic neurons. In these mice, constitutive expression of TLE1 inhibits neuronal development in the embryonic forebrain leading to increased apoptosis and neuronal loss in the ventral and dorsal telencephalon. These results provide the first direct evidence that TLE1 is an important negative regulator of postmitotic neuronal differentiation in the mammalian central nervous system.

J	Guillaume, R; Trudel, M				Guillaume, R; Trudel, M			Distinct and common developmental expression patterns of the murine Pkd2 and Pkd1 genes	MECHANISMS OF DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Pkd2; Pkd1; metanephric blastema; kidney; mesenchyme; cartilage	POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; C-MYC; APOPTOSIS	Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most commonly inherited renal diseases. At least two genes, PKD2 and PKD2 are implicated in the development of this disease. Our pathogenetic studies showed that the human and murine polycystic kidney disease (PKD) involves failure to switch out of a renal developmental program. We have thus undertaken a detailed comparative expression analysis of Pkd2 and Pkd1 from the morula stage to adulthood. Pkd2 expression was detected as early as the morula and blastocyst stages as observed for Pkd1. Strong Pkd2 expression, similar to Pkd1, was displayed in all mesenchymal and cartilaginous tissues during mouse development. However major differences in Pkd2 expression in comparison to Pkd1 were identified. First, in contrast to Pkd1, the neural crest cell-derived tissues displayed a low to undetectable Pkd2 expression at all ages. Second, no increase in Pkd2 expression was detected during mesenchymal condensation. Third, high Pkd2 expression in the kidneys was localized mainly to the tubular epithelium of the cortical region from murine development to adulthood. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Design: At two test times 18 months apart (time 1 and time 2), men (time 1, n = 31; time 2, n = 23), women who were using estrogen (time 1, n = 14; time 2, n = 10), and women who were not using estrogen (time 1, n = 41; time 2, n = 27), whose average age was 72.1 and 73.4 years at time 1 and time 2, respectively, were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests that measured verbal memory, visual memory, concentration and attention, language fluency, and semantic memory. Plasma levels of E-2 and free T were assessed by radioimmunoassay. Results: The men had higher free T levels than both groups of women at both test times. Although women who were using estrogen had higher E-2 levels than those of the men and of the women who were not using estrogen, the men's E-2 levels were also significantly higher than those of the women who were not using estrogen. Moreover, the women who were using estrogen and the men had higher Forward Digit Span scores compared with the women who were not using estrogen at both test times, and women who were using estrogen had higher Backward Digit Span scores than those who were not using estrogen. Both groups of women performed better than the men on the Category Retrieval Test (verbal fluency). The performance of women who were using estrogen on the Delayed Selective Reminding Test (long-term rote memory) improved over time compared with that of the men and of the women who were not using estrogen. Conclusions: These findings raise the possibility that higher E-2 levels in elderly men and in women who use estrogen may protect against some declines in explicit memory with normal aging.

Compared to non-responders, schizophrenic patients who are responders to neuroleptic medications are characterized by a high female/male ratio,(2) a better longterm outcome(3) and more frequently disturbed dopamine neurotransmission.(4) In this study, we compared two groups of schizophrenic patients selected on the basis of their long-term response to neuroleptics (excellent responders and non-responders) and a group of healthy volunteers, with regard to a missense mutation (677C --> T) in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. This polymorphism was chosen because it is functional(5) and was previously associated with schizophrenia.(6) The present study revealed a significant association between schizophrenia and allele T of this gene. This association was entirely due to an over-representation of allele T in responder patients compared to controls; nonresponder patients did not differ from controls. Genotype TT was more frequent in responder patients compared to controls, thus replicating the findings of Arinami et al.(6) These results strongly suggest that the MTHFR gene is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia characterized by a rapid and sustained therapeutic response to typical neuroleptics and/or a good long-term prognosis/favorable therapeutic outcome.

Microiontophoretically-applied 5-HT, DOI and mCPP induced current-dependent inhibition of neuronal firing activity in both brain regions. There was no difference between 5-HT2C receptor mutants and wild-type mice in the ability of 5-HT or DOI to inhibit neuronal firing at any current used. In contrast, there was a reduced ability of mCPP to inhibit firing activity in the OFC when ejected at 10 nA. Unexpectedly, there was a small but significant increase in mCPP-induced inhibition in the caudate nucleus of mutant mice. In the OFC, the 5-HT2A antagonist MDL 100907 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly antag onized the effect of both DOI and mCPP. In contrast, the non-selective 5-HT antagonist clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly antagonized only mCPP in the wild-type mice. However, neither MDL 100907 nor clozapine antagonized DOI or mCPP in the caudate nucleus. Finally, it required significantly less quisqualate to activate neurons in the 5-HT2C receptor mutants than in the wild-type mice, suggesting that 5-HT2C receptors serve a tonic inhibitory role in membrane excitability. The present results indicate that the inhibitory action of DOI is predominantly mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor in the OFC. mCPP, when applied locally, inhibits OFC firing activity by acting on both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. However, DOI and mCPP might be acting ill the caudate nucleus through an atypical 5-HT2 receptor yet to be characterized.

During the early part of acquisition, Lurcher mutants had lower latencies before falling on either treadmill than normal mice, but not during a retention test. For both Lurcher mutants and controls, the amount of time spent walking as a function of time spent on the belt increased with an increase in belt speed. Lurcher mutants had higher walking time/total time ratios on the slow but not on the fast treadmill. It is concluded that cerebellar cortical degeneration impaired the time course of acquisition but not long-term retention of the treadmill task. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Ptx1 and Ptx2 are expressed in the stomodeum and its derivatives including the pituitary, as well as in mesodermal derivatives, whereas Ptx3 is expressed in one neuronol lineage of the brain and in the eyes. A large set of downstream target genes have been identified for Ptx1 in the pituitary gland where it acts as a pan-pituitary regulator of transcription. In particular, Ptx1 contributes to promoter- and lineage-specific transcription by interaction with cell-restricted facto rs such as SF-1, Egr-1, Pit1, and the basic helix-loop-helix heterodimer NeuroD1/Pan1. We describe the cloning from pituitary cells and the characterization of a Ptx1 isoform, named Ptx1b, generated by alternative promoter usage. The two Ptx1 and two Ptx2 isoforms have similar in vitro DNA binding specificities and they all activate transcription driven by a panel of pituitary promoters, including those for proopiomelanocortin, alpha GSU, LH beta, FSH beta, GnRH-R, TSH beta, PRL, and GH. Also like Ptx1, the Ptx1b, Ptx2a, and Ptx2b transcription factors synergize with the structurally unrelated factors SF-1, Egr-1, Pit1, and NeuroD1/Pan1 to activate promoter-specific transcription. In conclusion, the pituitary transcriptional activities of the four Ptx isoforms do not appear to be dependent on the va riant N-termini of these factors. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

In the first memory task, the subjects were required to view a sequence of three pattern stimuli, randomly selected from a familiar set of four stimuli, and then identify which one of three simultaneously presented stimuli was the one that had not been presented in the previous array. In the other task, the subjects were required to observe an identical sequence of three randomly selected pattern stimuli and then to respond by Selecting those same stimuli in the order presented. In comparison to a baseline control task, increases in signal intensity were observed, bilaterally, in the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and in the right ventrolateral frontal cortex in both memory tasks. When the two tasks were compared directly, however, the first memory task, which had the higher monitoring requirement, yielded significantly greater signal intensity changes in area 9/46 of the right mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex. These results provide further evidence for the precise functional contribution made by the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex in visual working memory tasks and concur closely with findings in nonhuman primates.

A statistical test can then be applied to this set of measurements in order to detect a statistically significant difference between two groups. We have applied this methodology to highlight evidence of genetic encoding of the shape of neuroanatomical structures. To investigate genetic constraint, we studied if shapes were more similar within 10 pairs of monozygotic twins than within interpairs and compared the results with those obtained from 10 pairs of dizygotic twins. The statistical analysis was performed using a Mantel permutation test. We show, using simulations, that this statistical test applied on modal distances can detect a possible genetic encoding. When applied to real data, this study highlighted genetic constraints on the shape of the central sulcus. We found from 10 pairs of monozygotic twins that the intrapair modal distance of the central sulcus was significantly smaller than the interpair modal distance, for both the left central sulcus (Z = -2.66; P < 0.005) and the right central sulcus (Z = -2.26; P < 0.05). Genetic constraints on the definition of the central sulcus shape were confirmed by applying the same experiment to 10 pairs of normal young individuals (Z = -1.39; Z = -0.63, i.e., values not significant at the P < 0.05 level) and 10 pairs of dizygotic twins (Z = 0.47; Z = 0.03, i.e., values not significant at the P < 0.05 level).

A significant response was observed with this compound at a dose of 0.01 amol (6000 molecules). Tyr(NMe)-Arg-OH-nociception was completely blocked by the kyotorphin antagonist leucyl-arginine and its enzymatically stable, N-methylated analog, as well as by CP-99994, a specific neurokinin 1 antagonist. These findings suggest that the nociceptive effect produced by Tyr(NMe)-Arg-OH in subattomol doses occurs via specific interaction with the kyotorphin receptor and that the extraordinary potency observed may result from amplification through local substance P release.

No group differences were found in mean RT and correct responses. Although early occipital ERPs were not affected in the ADHD group, the peak latency of early anterior ERPs (N1, P1, N2) was significantly delayed. ADHD showed a larger effect of stimulus type on the frontal negativity (N530) and the posterior late negativity (nSW) and a smaller effect of stimulus type on anterior N2 and posterior P3b amplitude. The development of N530 and P450 amplitude across blocks of five trials was analyzed using orthogonal polynomial trend analysis of variance software. In the control group, P450 amplitude to "frequent" stimuli reduced across blocks. In the ADHD group, N530 amplitude increased for "rare" stimuli across blocks. It is suggested that the ADHD group showed a lack of automatization of the categorization process with increasing time on task for which they compensated by controlled attentional processes.

Following a description of the general characteristics of OSAS, we review the main cognitive functions reported as being impaired in OSAS patients. These include general intellectual functioning, attentional functioning, memory and learning abilities, executive functions, and motor performance. Based on this review, we propose a test battery designed to cover these cognitive processes while taking into account the time constraints present in most research and clinical centers. In addition to providing a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation of OSAS patients, the proposed test battery should facilitate the comparison of results from different laboratories.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of prompt discharge combined with home rehabilitation on function, community reintegration, and health-related quality of life during the first 3 months after stroke. Methods-A randomized trial was carried out involving patients who required rehabilitation services and who had a caregiver at home. When medically ready for discharge, persons with stroke were randomized to either the home intervention group (n=58) or the usual care group (n=56). The home group received a 4-week, tailor-made home program of rehabilitation and nursing services; persons randomized to the usual care group received services provided through a variety of mechanisms, depending an institutional, care provider, and personal preference. The main outcome measure was the Physical Health component of the Measuring Outcomes Study Short-Form-36 (SF-36), Associated outcomes measures included the Timed Up & Go (TUG), Barthel Index (BI), the Older Americans Resource Scale for instrumental activities of daily living (OARS-IADL), Reintegration to Normal Living (RNL), and the SF-36 Mental Health component. Results-The total length of stay for the home group was, on average, 10 days, 6 days shorter than that for the usual care group. There were no differences between the 2 groups on the BI or on the TUG at either 1 or 3 months after stroke; however. there was a significantly beneficial impact of the home intervention on IADL and reintegration (RNL), By 3 months after stroke, the home intervention group showed a significantly higher score on the SF-36 Physical Health component than the usual care group. The total number of services received by the home group was actually lower than that received by the usual care group. Conclusions-Prompt discharge combined with home rehabilitation appeared to translate motor and functional gains that occur through natural recovery and rehabilitation into a greater degree of higher-level function and satisfaction with community reintegration, and these in turn were translated into a better physical health.

In previous studies, becaplermin gel was administered once daily but dressings were changed twice daily. In the present study of 134 patients with diabetes mellitus and full thickness lower extremity ulcers, dressings were changed only once per day, simplifying the treatment regimen. Efficacy criteria included the percentage of patients achieving complete healing within the 20-week treatment period, the time to achieve complete healing, the rate of ulcer recurrence during the 6-month period following healing, and treatment compliance. Complete healing of ulcers was achieved in 57.5% of patients, with a mean time to closure of 63 days and a recurrence rate of 21% at 6 months. Of the potential factors affecting ulcer healing, only drug compliance (p < 0.001), dressing compliance (p < 0.01), the presence of infection (p < 0.01), baseline ulcer area (p < 0.05), and baseline total wound evaluation score (p < 0.05) were significantly associated with healing. Results of this study further confirm the efficacy and safety of becaplermin gel for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic ulcers.

Our investigations describe the influences of the contextual stimuli upon the occurrence of synchronization, in anaesthetized cats. Once a significant synchronization was recorded in the cross-correlogram (XCRG) between evoked action potentials of two groups of neurons in response to a drifting sine-wave grating, additional gratings were positioned outside the compound receptive field. The synchronization strength was then measured in relation to the difference between the orientations of the central and peripheral gratings. In the majority of cases results indicate that the synchronization is facilitated with larger orientation disparities. Thus, our data support the notion that contrasting features of images facilitate synchrony of activity between neurons. NeuroReport 11:1313-1317 (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The present study aimed to determine the effect of the selective non-peptide rat neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists WIN 51,708 and CP-96,345 on the firing activity of rat dorsal raphe serotonin (5-HT) and locus coeruleus noradrenaline (NA) neurons. While WIN51,708 (2 mg/kg, i.v.) and CP-96,345 (0.15 mg/kg, i.v.) did not modify the firing activity of 5-HT and NA neurons, both antagonists attenuated the suppressant effect of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine on the firing activity of both types of neurons. In contrast, the responsiveness of 5-HT neurons to the i.v. administration of the 5-HT autoreceptor agonist LSD and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT remained unchanged. These findings suggest that NK1 receptor antagonists affect markedly the NA system via an attenuation of the function of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors on the cell body of NA neurons and, consequently, may also modulate 5-HT neurotransmission.

Eye movements were monitored in the scanner. Compared with fixation, pursuit and predictive saccades activated a network of highly similar areas, including frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, V5 and medial cuneus. Our findings are consistent with non-human primate studies that suggest that pursuit and saccades are controlled by similar and adjacent neural areas. Pursuit was associated with greater activation of caudate than saccades, suggesting a role for basal ganglia in pursuit that is consistent with studies of neurological populations. Saccades were associated with greater activation of cerebellum and frontal eye fields. A frontal-cerebellar loop may be important in coordinating the preparation and timing of saccades in predictive tracking. NeuroReport 11:1335-1340 (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Khiat, C. Bard, A. Lacroix, J. Rousseau, Y. Boulanger, Brain metabolic alterations in Cushing's syndrome as monitored by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, NMR Biomed. 12 (1999) 357-363], proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) was used to evaluate changes in cerebral metabolites in patients with Cushing's syndrome as compared to normal subjects. Data recorded in the frontal, thalamic and temporal areas demonstrated statistically significant decreases of the Cho/Cr ratios in the frontal and thalamic areas but not in the temporal area for Cushing's syndrome patients. No statistically significant changes in the NAA/Cr ratios were measured in any of the areas studied. In this follow-up study, MRS data are reported for ten patients after correction of hypercortisolism which demonstrate a statistically significant recovery of the choline levels in the frontal and thalamic areas. No variation in the NAA, Cr and mI metabolite ratios relative to H2O could be measured. Results are interpreted as an inhibition of the phosphatidylcholine degrading phospholipases by glucocorticoids which disappears after correction of hypercortisolism. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The bioactive peptides are then stored in secretory granules until they are released extracellularly upon the induction of a fusion between granules and the plasma membrane, in response to secretagogues. We used the mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells as a model to determine if the capacities to convert and store neuropeptides and to secrete them in a regulated fashion are established coordinately during neuronal differentiation. We have previously shown that both undifferentiated P19 cells and their neuronal derivatives express the largely distributed furin, PACE4 and PC5 convertases, whereas only neuronal derivatives express the neuroendocrine convertase PC2. In addition, undifferentiated cells displayed furin- rather than PC2-like converting capacities. The present work demonstrates that day 8 P19 neurons mainly convert prosomatostatin (proSS) to somatostatin-14 (SS-14) using HPLC and radioimmunoassay (RIA) analyses, indicating that P19 cells acquire PC2-like converting capacities as a consequence of neuronal differentiation. SS-14 was predominantly intracellular in neuronal cells which were shown to express several granins, markers of granules, by Western blotting. However, cell membrane depolarization with 50 mM K+, a general secretagogue stimulus, evoked the release of SS-14 by day 12, but not by day 8, P19 neurons. The results thus demonstrate that capacities to convert and store neuropeptides can be established before coupling of stimulus-secretion during neuronal differentiation.

We have analyzed the genomic DNA from nine sialidosis patients of multiple ethnic origin in order to find mutations responsible for the enzyme deficiency. The activity of the identified variants was studied by transgenic expression. One patient had a frameshift mutation (G623delG deletion), which introduced a stop codon, truncating 113 amino acids. All others had missense mutations: G679G-->A (Gly227Arg), C893C-->T (Ala298Val), G203G-->T (Gly68Val), A544A-->G (Ser182Gly) C808C-->T (Leu270Phe) and G982G-->A (Gly328Ser), We have modeled the three-dimensional structure of sialidase based on the atomic coordinates of the homologous bacterial sialidases, located the positions of mutations and estimated their potential effect. This analysis showed that five mutations are clustered in one region on the surface of the sialidase molecule. These mutations dramatically reduce the enzyme activity and cause a rapid intralysosomal degradation of the expressed protein. We hypothesize that this region may be involved in the interface of sialidase binding with lysosomal cathepsin A and/or beta-galactosidase in their high-molecular-weight complex required for the expression of sialidase activity in the lysosome.

Methods: The authors studied 19 patients with intractable partial epilepsy and an isolated structural cerebral lesion (10 TL, 9 extra-TL; 10 cortical dysplasia [CD], 9 non-CD lesions). Proton MRS imaging was used,to determine the average relative resonance intensity of NAA for the TL regions of the left and right hemispheres. Values less than two SDs below the mean of normal control subjects were considered abnormal. Results: Fourteen patients (74%) had abnormally low NAA relative to creatine (NAA/Cr) in at least one TL, Three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; lesion pathology, lesion location, side of NAA/Cr decrease) showed that ipsilateral NAA/Cr was lower than contralateral (p = 0.04). Three-way ANOVA (lesion location, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, side of NAA/Cr decrease) showed that generalized tonic-clonic seizures were associated with lower TL NAA/Cr (p = 0.02). Lesion location and pathology showed no main effect on the NAA-to-Cr ratio in either analysis (p > 0.05). Linear regression analyses between seizure duration and NAA/Cr decrease was not significant. Conclusion: The authors demonstrated abnormally low TL NAA/Cr in the majority of patients with structural cerebral lesions. This abnormality did not differ with lesion location or pathology. They propose that the altered function of neuronal networks by an isolated structural cerebral lesion results in remote "functional dual pathology."

To examine the role of calreticulin during in vivo development, mice deficient in calreticulin were generated by targeted inactivation of the calreticulin gene. Calreticulin-deficient mutants die in utero, mostly in late gestation. Half of these embryos had decreased cardiac cell mass, associated with increased apoptosis of cardiac myocytes, In vitro differentiation cultures of calreticulin-deficient embryonic stem cells resulted in fewer embryoid bodies with contractile activity than cultures derived from calreticulin +/- stem cells (P < 0.001). Sixteen percent of the mutants exhibited exencephaly secondary to a defect in neural tube closure. Embryos surviving until Embryonic Day 16.5 had omphalocele. Lack of calreticulin did not influence survival of embryonic fibroblasts under various endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions. However, calreticulin did influence cell migration in a calcium- and substrate-dependent manner. We conclude that calreticulin is not essential during the early stages of embryonic development, but is important for the development of heart and brain and for ventral body wall closure. The observed abnormalities are compatible with a role of calreticulin in the modulation of cellular calcium signaling. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Moreover, multisubunit receptors are difficult to target, because each subunit contributes to ligand affinity, and each subunit may have distinct and sometimes opposing functions. Here, the nerve growth factor receptor subunits p75 and the tyrosine kinase TrkA were studied using artificial ligands that bind specifically to their extracellular domain. Bivalent TrkA Ligands afford robust signals. However, genuine monomeric and monovalent TrkA ligands afford partial agonism, activate the tyrosine kinase activity, cause receptor internalization, and induce survival and differentiation in cell lines and primary neurons. Monomeric and monovalent TrkA Ligands can synergize with ligands that bind the p75 subunit. However, the p75 ligands used in this study must be bivalent, and monovalent p75 ligands have no effect. These findings will be useful in designing and developing screens of small molecules selective for tyrosine kinase receptors and indicate that strategies for designing agonists of multisubunit receptors require consideration of the role of each subunit. Last, the strategy of using anti-receptor mAbs and small molecule hormone mimics as receptor ligands could be applied to the study of many other heteromeric cell surface receptors.

Recombinant mammalian P2X subunits assemble in homomeric ionotropic ATP receptors that differ by their agonist sensitivity and desensitization rate in heterologous expression systems. Using site-directed mutagenesis and voltage clamp recording in Xenopus oocytes, we identified the highly conserved protein kinase C site TX(K/R) located in the intracellular N terminus of P2X subunits as a critical determinant of kinetics in slowly desensitizing (time constant, >1 min) rat P2X(2) receptors, Mutant receptors P2X(2)T18A, T18N, and K20T devoid of this consensus site exhibited quickly desensitizing properties (time constant, <1 s), In contrast with wild-type receptors, mutant P2X(2) receptors with truncated C terminus exhibited variable cell-specific kinetics with quickly desensitizing currents converted to slowly desensitizing currents by phorbol ester-mediated stimulation of protein kinase C, Phosphorylation of Thr(18) was demonstrated directly by immunodetection using specific monoclonal antibodies directed against the phosphothreonine-proline motif, Our data indicate that both phosphorylation of the conserved threonine residue in the N-terminal domain by protein kinase C and interaction between the two cytoplasmic domains of P2X(2) subunits are necessary for the full expression of slowly desensitizing ATP-gated channels.

The present studies examine the presence of differences in opioid peptide mRNA content and mu and kappa opioid receptor densities, between ethanol naive AA and ANA rats bred selectively for their high and low alcohol consumption, respectively. In situ hybridization was used to compare the content of proopiomelanocortin, proenkephalin and prodynorphin mRNA in distinct brain regions known to be involved in the reinforcing properties of addictive drugs, between rats from each line. Results indicated that AA rats had a significantly greater content of proopiomelanocortin mRNA in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, of proenkephalin mRNA in the prefrontal cortex and of prodynorphin mRNA in the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (p less than or equal to .05). Receptor autoradiography was performed using H-3-labeled ligands specific for mu and kappa opioid receptors. AA rats were found to have a greater density of mu opioid receptors in the shell region of the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex, but a lower density of kappa opioid receptors in the ventromedial hypothalamus, compared to ANA rats. The present data demonstrate the presence of inherited differences in the activity of distinct components of the endogenous opioid system in some brain regions associated with the processes of reward and reinforcement; and as such, may play a role in determining differences in ethanol drinking between AA and ANA rats.

This study addresses the brain mechanisms required for the perception of such a pattern. We report the systematic evaluation of temporal perception in a patient with a single intact right auditory cortex and a large right frontal robe lesion. A striking dissociated deficit was demonstrated in the perception of temporal pattern at the level of tens or hundreds of milliseconds. This proves that, contrary to common belief mechanisms in the pathway up to and including the primary auditory cortex are not sufficient for the normal perception of temporal pattern. This work suggests a need for frontal processing for the normal perception of auditory pattern. NeuroReport 11:919-922 (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Somatostatin receptors and dopamine receptors are colocalized in neuronal subgroups, and somatostatin is involved in modulating dopamine-mediated control of motor activity. However, the molecular basis for such interaction between the two systems is unclear. Here, we show that dopamine receptor D2R and somatostatin receptor SSTR5 interact physically through hetero-oligomerization to create a novel receptor with enhanced functional activity. Our results provide evidence that receptors from different G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein)-coupled receptor families interact through oligomerization. Such direct intramembrane association defines a new level of molecular crosstalk between related G protein-coupled receptor subfamilies.

We now report the results of a similar study in humans. Methods: Three groups of healthy female social drinkers were administered a nutritionally balanced amino acid mixture (B, n = 13), a mixture deficient in the serotonin precursor, tryptophan (Trp-free, n = 14), or a phenylalanine/tyrosine deficient mixture (Phe/Tyr-free, n = 12). Six hours after administration of the amino acid mixture, alcohol ingestion was measured during a free-choice "Taste Test." Results: Compared to the B mixture, Phe/Tyr-free, but not Trp-free, significantly decreased the ingestion of alcohol [p < 0.02]. Neither Phe/Tyr-free nor Trp-free significantly decreased orange juice ingestion or the self-reported "Liking" of either substance. Some subjects experienced transient nausea and/or regurgitated the amino acid mixtures, but excluding these subjects did not change the results. Conclusions: The results suggest that (a) Phe/Tyr-free may be a suitable method for investigating the role of catecholamines in the self-administration and subjective effects of alcohol, (b) acutely decreased catecholamine neurotransmission might disrupt mechanisms mediating alcohol self-administration, and (c) acutely decreased serotonin neurotransmission seems not to alter alcohol self-administration.

Messenger RNA prepared from fetal and adult rat lung was used to prepare "representative amplicons," Adult-lung complementary DNA (cDNA) amplicons were used as "driver" in successive rounds of subtractive hybridization/amplification to isolate target fetal lung-specific cDNAs, A single clone, which was conserved and had near-perfect homology to eight human/rodent expressed sequence tags, was used as template for 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and SPICE (system for polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA ends) reactions to obtain the 3.6-kb cDNA, LGL2 (Genbank, AF 110195) encoding a deduced polypeptide (lgl2) of 963 amino acids. Northern analysis confirmed that LGL2 is differentially expressed in fetal lung (maximal during the pseudoglandular stage, gestational Days 14 to 16), induced by glucocorticoid, and enriched in epithelium relative to the mesenchyme. LGL2 was also detected in human fetal lung at gestational Week 16 as well as in human and rat fetal brain, heart, intestine, and kidney. We mapped LGL2 to chromosome 1p33-34.2. Comparison with sequences in the genome database identified lgl2 as a member of the karyopherin-beta family of nuclear import proteins, with greatest homology to transportin SR. Maximal expression of LGL2 in the pseudoglandular stage of development is coordinate with that of key transcription factors that regulate prominent signal transduction pathways in fetal lung organogenesis, We propose a role for lgl2 in nuclear import of transcription factors that regulate signal transduction during fetal lung development.

Five patients showed redundancy gain not exceeding probability models. Violation of probability models was not associated with a specific type of callosal lesion. Neural summation, which probably occurs at collicular level, may be modulated by cortical activity. To test this hypothesis, we used functional MRI, During detection of redundant simultaneous targets, activations in the extrastriate cortex were observed in a patient with callosal agenesis and redundancy gain violating probability models, but not in a patient with callosal agenesis and redundancy gain not exceeding probability models. We conclude that cortical activity in the extrastriate cortex may be a modulating factor in the magnitude of the redundancy gain during parallel visuomotor transforms.

J	Pitchford, NJ				Pitchford, NJ			Spoken language correlates of reading impairments acquired in childhood	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							BRAIN-LESIONS; CHILDREN; DYSLEXIA; HYPOTHESIS; APHASIA	This study reports the reading difficulties of five children following unilateral left hemisphere stroke sustained either before or during the early stages of literacy acquisition. Although each of the children experienced a period of disturbed language processing in the initial stages postonset, at the time of testing none of the children were considered to he clinically aphasic. Yet, on a standardized test of oral reading each of the children achieved a reading age that lagged behind chronological age and marbled reading impairments were disclosed in four of the five children. A set of standardized and nonstandardized tests, aimed at measuring aspects of cognitive and spoken language processing that are considered to be important for normal reading acquisition, was administered. Where nonstandardized tests were used, performance of each of the stroke children was compared to that of groups of normally developing control children, closely matched for chronological age. A range of residual deficits in cognitive and spoken language processing was disclosed among the five brain-damaged children that appeal rd to br associated with their reading impairments. Two children had expectedly poor reading due to a selective impairment in verbal IQ; a specific phonological reading disorder was revealed in two children, each of which had a residual impairment to phonological awareness; and delayed reading acquisition was observed in one child with a general language deficit. It is suggested that when a child suffers damage to the left hemisphere in the early stages of reading acquisition, difficulties with learning to read are likely to ensue and may arise as a consequence of an underlying cognitive or linguistic deficit.

In turn, the high relevance of emotional factors in the determination of stress responses led to a reconsideration of cognitive-affective interactions in nervous systems. Recent results revealed that improvement in depression treated with antidepressants (ADs) is associated with an increase in the neurosteroid 3 alpha 5 alpha tetrahydroprogesterone, both in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of recovered patients. The increase occurs with both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic ADs, An evaluation of the possible and putative roles for neurosteroids in the CNS is presented and suggestions for enhancing the type of supporting data from the laboratory diagnosis of depressions are advanced.

The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of supraspinal opioid receptors in modulating the nociceptive response to persistent inflammation in rats. 2 Subcutaneous administration of 50 mu l of complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) into the plantar surface of the hindpaw induced a significant decrease in paw withdrawal latency to thermal stimuli (P<0.01) at 24 h post-injection. 3 Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the mu opioid receptor agonists, DAMGO and morphine, and the delta opioid receptor agonists, deltorphin II and SNC80, significantly reversed the hyperalgesic response associated with peripheral inflammation in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.0001). 4 The mu and delta agonists also significantly attenuated the antinociceptive response to acute thermal stimulation in rats (P< 0.001). However, deltorphin II and SNC80 were less potent, and in the case of SNC80 less efficacious, in modulating the response to acute thermal nociception in comparison to hyperalgesia associated with persistent inflammation. 5 These results indicate that mu and delta opioid receptors in the brain modulate descending pain pathways to attenuate the nociceptive response to acute thermal stimuli in both normal and inflamed tissues. The heightened response to delta agonists in the hyperalgesia model suggests that delta opioid receptors in the brain are promising targets for the treatment of pain arising from chronic inflammation.

Neither theoretical analyses nor current empirical approaches are sufficiently developed for practical calculation of conveyance for all conditions experienced in practice. An alternative approach, using artificial neural network modelling, has been successfully applied to predict conveyance under a wide range of conditions. The model proposed uses a feed-forward system with one hidden layer and an error back-propagation learning procedure. It predicts a dimensionless discharge using input describing the main channel and floodplain flow depths, vegetation density over the cross section, channel sinuosity, transverse floodplain slope, and floodplain bend tightness. The discharge is dimensionalized by multiplication with the composite discharge calculated assuming frictional resistance only. The model was trained using 45 data sets representing a range of main channel and floodplain characteristics and tested using 15 additional data sets. The discharge prediction error for all the data used in development and testing the model was -0.19% on average and exceeded 15% for one condition only.

If the noise statistics are unknown, the optimality of the Kalman gain is never guaranteed. This paper focuses on the analysis of a neural estimator based on the structure of the Kalman filter. The estimator has the capability of estimating the states of the plant in a stochastic environment without knowledge of noise statistics. The Kalman gain is replaced by an artificial neural network whose weights adjustment permits minimization of the estimation error An application is shown based on the estimation of velocities in the roll and yaw axes, the pitch velocity and the pitch angle of a Boeing 747 aircraft in control of longitudinal motion.

In order to reduce these differences, a segmentation protocol was established with 40 healthy normal control subjects recently scanned in our laboratory, Data acquisition was performed with a three-dimensional gradient echo technique, and scans were corrected for non-uniformity and registered into standard stereotaxic space prior to segmentation. Volumetric analysis was performed manually using three-dimensional software that allows simultaneous analysis of sagittal, coronal and horizontal images. Intra- and inter-rater coefficients yielded correlation coefficients comparable with other protocols. The hippocampal volume was larger in the right hemisphere (3324 versus 3208 mm(3)), while no interhemispheric differences for the amygdala (1154 versus 1160 mm(3)) could be observed. Most importantly, results from recent segmentation protocols for hippocampus and amygdala seem to approach each other with regard to mean volumes and interhemispheric differences. This indicates that the advances in scanning technique, volume preparation and segmentation protocols allow a more precise definition of medial temporal lobe structures with MRI, and that results for mean volumes for hippocampus and amygdala from different laboratories will eventually become comparable.

Each stem axon gives rise to a peripheral branch and a descending central branch. It was previously shown that some spikes generated by constant muscle stretch fail to enter the soma during fictive mastication, The present study examines whether the central axon is similarly controlled. These axons were functionally identified in anaesthetized and paralysed rabbits, and tonic afferent firing was elicited by muscle stretch. For the purpose of comparison, responses were recorded extracellularly both from the somatic region and from the central axon in the lateral brainstem. Two types of fictive masticatory movement patterns were induced by repetitive stimulation of the masticatory cortex and monitored from the trigeminal motor nucleus. Field potentials generated by spike-triggered averaging of action potentials from the spindle afferents were employed to determine their postsynaptic effects on jaw-closing motoneurons. Tonic firing of 32% NVmes units was inhibited during the jaw-opening phase, but spike frequency during closing was almost equal to the control rate during both types of fictive mastication. A similar inhibition occurred during opening in 83% of the units recorded along the central branch. However, firing frequency in these was significantly increased during closing in 94%, probably because of the addition of antidromic action potentials generated by presynaptic depolarization of terminals of the central branch. These additional spikes do not reach the soma, but do appear to excite motoneurons. The data also show that the duration and/or frequency of firing during the bursts varied from one pattern of fictive mastication to another. We conclude that the central axons of trigeminal muscle spindle afferents are functionally decoupled from their stem axons during the jaw-closing phase of mastication. During this phase, it appears that antidromic impulses in the central axons provide one of the inputs from the masticatory central pattern generator (CPG) to trigeminal motoneurons.

We have previously reported on the enrichment of cultured rat hippocampal neurons in specific [I-125][Leu(31),Pro(34)]PYY/BIBP3226-sensitive (Y-1) binding sites and Y-1 receptor mRNAs [St-Pierre et al., (1998) Br. J. Pharmacol., 123, p183]. We have now identified which cell types express the Y-1 receptor. The majority of Y-1 receptors, visualized using either the radiolabeled probe [I-125][Leu(31),Pro(34)]PYY or two antibodies directed against distinct domains of the Y-1 receptor, was expressed in neurons as revealed by neuron-specific enolase (NSE) immunostaining. One antibody was directed against the second extracelllular loop of the Y-1 receptor (amino acids 185-203) whereas the second was directed against the intracellular C-terminal loop (amino acids 355-382), The labelling was evident over both perikarya and processes. Neurons labelled by the various Y-1 receptor probes were mostly glutamate-positive as revealed by double immunostaining. Most interestingly, a number of NPY-positive cultured hippocampal neurons were also enriched with the Y-1 receptor, suggesting that this subtype may act as an autoreceptor to regulate NPY release in the hippocampus. These results thus provide an anatomical basis for the modulation of glutamate and NPY release by the Y-1 receptor in the hippocampus.

Cells were initially stimulated with moving, optimally oriented, single 20 degrees-long bars of light, centred on the compound receptive field of a pool of cortical neurons. When this kind of stimulus evoked intrinsic gamma oscillations and/or synchronization, we gradually fractured the original target. in addition, colinearity was ruptured by forming L- and T-shaped configurations. All fractures and discontinuities were introduced well outside the excitatory receptive field. Multiunit activity in the visual cortex (areas 17 and 18) was recorded in anaesthetized cats. Recording sites were separated by 0.4-1.2 mm. The data analysis indicates that gamma oscillations follow a rule by which unfractured bars yielded the highest S/N ratios. Synchronization strength, as revealed by the central peak in cross-correlograms, also seemed to depend upon stimulus configuration. However, the magnitude of the central peak failed to follow a consistent trend. For instance, the greatest magnitude of the central peak occurred for both colinear and orthogonal types of target. Our results support the notion that both gamma oscillations and neuronal synchronization are stimulus-dependent.

The majority of these deletions are larger than 50 kb, with a breakpoint usually lying outside the NF2 gene. We identified two cases of intragenic deletion with loss of 1.5 and 40 kb, respectively. In both cases, one boundary of the deletion was located in or at the proximity of an SVA sequence in NF2 intron 4. No sequence identity longer than 5 bases and no signal of specific recombination have been evidenced on either side of the deletion breakpoints. These observations are compatible with a nonhomologous recombination being responsible for the genomic deletions. In a third case, a paracentric inversion of chromosome 22 was found. This chromosomal rearrangement breaks the NF2 gene in two parts and carries the first NF2 exon in a juxta-centromeric position. The variability in position of the deletions and the observation of a new chromosomal rearrangement in the NF2 gene underscore the importance of FISH analysis in the molecular diagnosis of NF2.

Brain edema is also a serious complication of acute liver failure (ALF), To assess the effectiveness of hypothermia in ALF, groups of rats were subjected to hepatic devascularization (portacaval anastomosis, followed 48 hours later by hepatic artery ligation), and body temperatures were maintained at either 35 degrees C (hypothermic) or 37 degrees C (normothermic). Mild hypothermia resulted in a significant delay in the onset of severe encephalopathy and in reduction of brain water content compared with normothermic ALF rats (control [n = 8] 80.22%; ALF-37 degrees C [n = 8] 81.74%; ALF-35 degrees C [n = 8] 80.48% [P <.01 compared with ALF-37 degrees C]). This protective effect was accompanied by a significant reduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (but not plasma) ammonia concentrations (CSF ammonia: control: 0.05 mg/dL; ALF-37 degrees C: 1.01 mg/dL; ALF-35 degrees C: 0.07 mg/dL, P <.01. compared with ALF-37 degrees C). In vivo cerebral microdialysis studies revealed that mild hypothermia resulted in a significant reduction of extracellular glutamate concentrations in the brains of rats with ALF (control: 1.06 mu mol/L; ALF37 degrees C: 2.74 mu mol/L; ALF-35 degrees C: 1.49 mu mol/L [:P <.01 compared with ALF-37 degrees C]). These findings suggest that: 1) mild hypothermia is an effective approach to the prevention of the central nervous system consequences of experimental ALF; and that 2) the beneficial effect of hypothermia is mediated via mechanisms involving reduced blood-brain. transfer of ammonia and/or reduction of extracellular brain glutamate concentrations. Mild hypothermia may be an effective approach to delay the onset of brain edema in patients with ALF awaiting liver transplantation.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of such exposure on motor performance. This cross-sectional study was carried out in May 1996, in a village located on the banks of the Tapajos river in the Amazonian Basin, Brazil. Information concerning sociodemographics, health, smoking habits, alcohol drinking, dietary habits and work history were collected using an interview-administered questionnaire. Mercury concentrations were measured by cold vapor atomic absorption in blood and hair of each participant, of whom those aged between 15 and 79 years were assessed for motor performance (n = 84). Psychomotor performance was evaluated using the Santa Ana manual dexterity test, the Grooved Pegboard Fine motor test and the fingertapping motor speed test. Motor strength was measured by dynamometry for grip and pinch strength. Following the exclusion of 16 persons for previous head injury, working with mercury in the gold-mining sites, or for diabetes, the relationship between performance and bioindicators of mercury was examined using multivariate statistical analyses, taking into account covariables. All participants in the study reported eating fish, which comprised 61.8% of the total meals eaten during the preceding week. The median hair total mercury concentration was 9 mu g/g. Organic mercury accounted for 94.4 +/- 1.9% of the total mercury levels. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that hair mercury was inversely associated with overall performance on the psychomotor tests, while a tendency was observed with blood mercury. Semipartial regression analyses showed that hair total mercury accounted for 8% to 16% of the variance of psychomotor performance. Neither hair nor blood total mercury was associated with the results of the strength tests in women and men. Although dose-effect relationships were observed in this cross-sectional study, they may reflect higher exposure levels in the past. The findings of this study demonstrated neurobehavioral manifestations of subtle neurotoxic effects on motor functions, associated with low-level methylmercury exposure.

Thus, the language development of a very young girl (BL) who suffered a TBI at the age of 17 months was monitored for 6 months following the injury. Different procedures were used to measure her lexical and grammatical development: monthly parental checklists, fret-play sessions and word-learning tasks. BL's results were compared with two control groups (n = 5 and 9) matched for age and gender. Overall, the results are consistent with the classical view of acquired language disorders in children: despite an initial decrease in the use of her premorbid vocabulary, BL showed no durable significant impairment on any measure of lexical or grammatical development.

Results obtained with the repeat expansion detection technique (RED) have indicated that bipolar patients have an excess of expanded CAG repeats. However, it is not clear which loci account for this difference. Methods: Using lithium-responsive bipolar patients in order to reduce heterogeneity, we investigated five loci that are expressed in the brain and contain translated CAG repeats. A sample of 138 cases and 108 controls was studied. Genotypes were coded quantitatively or qualitatively and repeat distributions were compared. Results: No difference was found in allele distribution between cases and controls for any of the loci studied. In one locus - L10378 - patients had a tendency to present shorter alleles (28.1 versus 27.9 repeats; t = 2.55, df = 205, P = 0.011), however, this difference disappeared after correction for multiple testing. Limitations: The study has limitations common to most candidate gene association studies, that is, limited number of loci investigated and limited power to detect loci that account for a small proportion of the total genetic variability. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the loci investigated have no major role in the genetic predisposition to bipolar disorder. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

The model predicted a nonlinear relationship between stimulus-evoked changes of oxygen consumption and blood flow. The magnitude of the CMRO(2)/CBF ratio index (I(O2)) was used to indicate the degree of flow-metabolism coupling prevailing in specific areas of the brain during physiological stimulation. Therefore, the index provided a measure of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance contrast. To evaluate the changes of I(O2) in response to visual stimulation, the model was applied to the effect of a changing flicker rate of a visual stimulus on the magnitudes of CBF, CMRO(2), and oxygen diffusion capacity, in the human brain. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure the CBF and the CMRO(2) in 12 healthy volunteers who viewed a cross-hair (baseline) or a yellow-blue annular checkerboard reversing at frequencies of 1, 4, or 8 Hz. The magnitude of CBF in the primary visual cortex increased as a function of the checkerboard reversal rate and reached a maximum at the frequency of 8 Hz (z = 16.0), while the magnitude of CMRO(2) reached a maximum at 4 Hz (z = 4.0). Therefore, the calculated I(O2) was lower at 8 Hz than at 1 and 4 Hz, in contrast to the oxidative metabolic rate that reached its maximum at 4 Hz. The model explained the increase of oxygen consumption as the combined effect of increased blood flow and increased oxygen diffusion capacity in the region of visual activation.

By ED12, mu opioid receptor mRNA was detectable in the deep neuroepithelium of the cortical plate. In the developing rat central nervous system (ED13-PD40), transcripts were seen over numerous telencephalic and diencephalic structures, such as the olfactory bulb, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdaloid complex, hippocampal formation, hypothalamus and thalamus. In the vast majority of brain regions examined, the developmental profile of the mu opioid receptor gene expression is similar to that of its translated protein as established using receptor autoradiography. Once a hybridization signal is detected in the prenatal period, it gradually increased to reach maximal levels during the second and third postnatal weeks. By the end of the third postnatal week, mu opioid receptor mRNA levels decreased to reach amounts seen in adulthood. Our study demonstrates that mu opioid receptor gene expression is seen very early on in the embryonic rat brain with transient increases observed during the critical period of neurogenesis, neuronal migration and synaptogenesis, suggesting a role of this opioid receptor subtype in brain developmental processes.

Although previous studies have shown that glucocorticoids have deleterious consequences on fetal development, there is little information regarding the effects of clinically relevant repeated maternal doses of glucocorticoids on fetal growth and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. We hypothesised that repeated prenatal exposure to increased concentrations of glucocorticoids would alter fetal growth and HPA axis development. Pregnant ewes were injected with betamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) or vehicle at 104, 111 and 118 days of gestation (term 150 days). Animals were sacrificed at 125 and 146 days of gestation, at which time fetal weights were recorded. Maternal and fetal blood samples were gathered and fetal tissue collected. Maternal oestradiol concentrations were significantly greater than those in controls at 125 days of gestation, but were not different at 146 days. Maternal plasma progesterone concentrations were similar between groups at both 125 and 146 days of gestation. Weight at birth was significantly reduced by 23% at 125 days and 19% at 146 days of gestation (P < 0.05) after exposure to glucocorticoid. Cord plasma ACTH concentrations were not significantly different between groups at day 125, but were significantly increased in day 146 fetuses of ewes that had received betamethasone (P < 0.05). Cord plasma cortisol concentrations followed the same trend, although differences were not statistically significant. Cord plasma corticosteroid binding capacity (CBC) was significantly increased at 125 days of gestation in fetuses of betamethasone-treated animals (P < 0.05), but not at 146 days of gestation. To examine the mechanisms regulating the increase in cord plasma ACTH of 146-day fetuses, we used in situ hybridisation to determine the distribution and levels of mRNA encoding key pituitary and hypothalamic neuropeptides of the HPA axis. In pituitaries of 146-day fetuses, there were no significant differences in the regional pattern of distribution or amounts of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA between betamethasone-treated animals and controls, in either the pars intermedia or the inferior and superior regions of the pars distalis. Neither prohormone convertase (PC)-1 nor PC-2 mRNA levels in pituitaries of 146-day fetuses were significantly different between treatment groups. After maternal betamethasone, immunoreactive ACTH peptide content in the fetal pars distalis was not different but glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA levels in the pars distalis were increased significantly (P < 0.05). No significant difference in distribution pattern or concentrations of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) mRNA, GR mRNA, oxytocin mRNA and pre-proenkephalin mRNA were found in hypothalami from fetuses at 146 days of gestation after betamethasone treatment. We conclude that antenatal betamethasone given to pregnant sheep in a manner similar to that used in human obstetric practice results in reduced weight at birth at 125 and 146 days, and altered basal cord levels of plasma ACTH and corticosteroid binding capacity, but these changes are not reflective of changes in steady state: concentrations of POMC and CRH mRNA in the fetal pituitary or hypothalamus.

These patients also have slowed information processing speed, in the absence of apraxia, agnosia and global amnesia. By contrast to heredodegenerative ataxias, unilateral lesions of sudden onset cause transitory deficits of these neuropsychological functions. It is suggested that these deficits are caused by altered metabolic activity in cerebellar-related pathways. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of the current study was to establish the contribution of IFN-gamma to oligodendrocyte (OL) injury. Our studies utilized cultured human OLs, obtained by dissociation of surgically derived non-MS adult brain tissue. Neither cell survival nor myelin basic protein (MBP) gene expression were affected after 96 hours of treatment with IFN-gamma (100 U/ml), as assessed by LDH release, nucleosome enrichment assay, and RT-PCR. Expression of the death receptor Fas (CD95, APO-1) was, however, significantly increased. Furthermore, IFN-gamma-treated OLs became susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis when compared with untreated cells, and were protected by pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD. TNF-alpha augmented the IFN-gamma-induced effect. Our results thus indicate that IFN-gamma is not directly cytotoxic for human OLs in culture, but could indirectly modulate functional injury-related responses by upregulating Fas on the cell surface.

It is estimated that up to 38% of the middle-aged and older population fulfill diagnostic criteria for this condition. Although the memory deficits observed in these individuals are fairly mild, they can interfere with day-to-day functioning. This article presents a review of the types of memory decline observed in older people, the diagnostic criteria used to define memory decline, the physiological and morphological brain changes that accompany aging, and the potential pharmacological treatment options, focusing on agents that have been evaluated in mildly cognitively impaired or normal older populations.

Many interactive IGNS implementations employ preoperative images as a guide to the surgeons throughout the procedure. However, when a craniotomy is involved, tissue movement during a procedure can be a significant source of error in these systems. By incorporating intraoperative US imaging, the target volume can be scanned at any time, and two-dimensional US images may be compared directly to the corresponding slice from the pre-operative image. Homologous points may be mapped from the intraoperative to the preoperative image space with an accuracy of better than 2 mm, enabling the surgeon to use this information to assess the accuracy of the guidance system along with the progress of the procedure (e.g., extent of lesion removal) at any time during the operation. Anatomical features may be identified on both the pre-operative and intraoperative images and used to generate a deformation map, which can be used to warp the pre-operative image to match the intraoperative US image. System validation is achieved using a deformable multi-modality imaging phantom, and preliminary clinical results are presented. (C) 2000 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

J	Fraser, GL; Holmgren, J; Clarke, PBS; Wahlestedt, C				Fraser, GL; Holmgren, J; Clarke, PBS; Wahlestedt, C			Antisense inhibition of delta-opioid receptor gene function in vivo by peptide nucleic acids	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; IN-VIVO; SELECTIVE-INHIBITION; RAT-BRAIN; OLIGONUCLEOTIDES; PNA; OLIGODEOXYNUCLEOTIDES; ANTINOCICEPTION; SPECIFICITY; AGONISTS	Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) are synthetic analogs of DNA that hybridize to complementary oligonucleotide sequences with exceptional affinity and target specificity. The stability of PNA in biological fluids together with the unique hybridization characteristics of these structures suggests that PNA may have considerable potential as antisense agents for experimental use in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to modulate supraspinal delta-opioid receptor function in rats using PNA sequences designed to be complementary to a region of the rat delta-opioid receptor. Repeated i.c.v. administration of PNA over a period of 5 days significantly inhibited the antinociceptive response and locomotor response to selective delta-opioid receptor agonists. PNA attenuated delta-opioid receptor function in a sequence-specific, target-specific, and reversible manner characteristic of the functional inhibition caused by an antisense mechanism. There were no apparent toxicities arising from the PNA treatment based on the behavior of the animals and inspection of the treated tissues. Saturation binding studies on brain homogenates did not reveal any significant difference in receptor B(max) between treatment groups. However, [(35)S] guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate binding assays demonstrated a significant decrease in agonist efficacy in homogenates prepared from antisense-treated rats. Taken together, these results demonstrate that peptide nucleic acids are effective antisense agents in vivo and suggest that PNA may be a useful alternative to phosphodiester or phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, or variants thereof, for determination of gene function in vivo.

Binding site densities for the PTBR ligand [H-3-PK11195] are increased in autopsied brain tissue from PSE patients as well as in the brains of animals with experimental chronic liver failure. In the case of the animal studies, increased PTBR sites resulted from increased PTBR gene expression. Exposure of cultured astrocytes to ammonia or manganese (two neurotoxic agents which under normal circumstances are removed by the hepatobiliary system and which are found to accumulate in brain in PSE) results in increased densities of [H-3-PK11195] binding sites. Activation of PTBR is known to result in increased cholesterol uptake and increased synthesis in brain of neurosteroids some of which have potent positive allosteric modulator properties on the GABA-A receptor system. Accumulation of such substances in the brain in chronic liver failure could explain the neural inhibition characteristics of PSE. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Background: Lateralized soft signs, EEG topography, metabolic brain imaging, and neuropsychological test profiles suggest a predominance of left hemisphere dysfunction in dyslexia and right hemisphere dysfunction in hyperactivity. Method: Nine measures of lateralized performance were drawn from the Purdue pegboard, Letter cancellation, Rey complex figure, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) Mazes, and WISC Picture completion tests. Results: The children with left hemisphere lesions manifested significantly weaker performance on test components involving the right body side, relative to the normal controls, on the Purdue pegboard, Rey complex figure (delayed recall condition). and WISC Picture completion tests, and the dyslexic children on the former two. The children with right hemisphere lesions manifested significantly weaker performance on test components involving the left body side, relative to the normal controls, on the WISC Mazes test. as did the hyperactive children. Conclusions: We propose that(1) contralateral performance decrement results from a unilateral cortical lesion in children, and (2) developmental dyslexia may comprise a slight predominance of left hemisphere dysfunction and developmental hyperactivity of right hemisphere dysfunction.

Because 5-HT1A receptor activation hyperpolarizes and inhibits the firing activity of CA(3) pyramidal neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, the degree of disinhibition produced by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 was determined using in vivo extracellular recordings. In controls, as well as in rats receiving a lithium diet for 3 days, the administration of WAY 100635(25-100 mu g/kg, IV) did not modify the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons. When the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (10 mg/kg/day, SC), the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine (2.5 mg/kg/day, SC) and the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day, SC) were administered alone for 21 days, a dose of 50 mu g/kg of WAY 100635 was needed to increase significantly the firing activity of these neutrons. On the other hand, WAY 100635, at a dose of only 25 mu g/kg, increased significantly the firing rate of CA(3) pyramidal neurons in rats receiving both a long-term antidepressant treatment and a short-term lithium diet. It is concluded that the addition of lithium to antidepressant treatments produced a greater disinhibition of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons than any treatments given alone. The present results support the notion that the addition of lithium to antidepressants may produce a therapeutic response in treatment-resistant depression by enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission.

The median age of those with ND-TLE and those with INT-TLE did not significantly differ (P = 0.92). All five patients with ND-TLE had bilateral reductions in the NAA/Cr ratio. Two of the five patients with INT-TLE had bilateral reductions in the NAA/Cr ratio; three had unilateral reductions in the NAA/Cr ratio. In the three patients with lesions the NAA/Cr ratio decrease extended outside these lesions. No significant differences were detected in any temporal lobe region between the ND-TLE and INT-TLE groups. The severity of the neuronal dysfunction in the children with ND-TLE was at least as severe as in those with INT-TLE and was not restricted to one temporal lobe, implying that the neuronal abnormalities observed in patients with TLE occur before the clinical manifestations.

LIS1 is hypothesized to regulate nuclear movement in migrating neurons through interactions with the cytoskeleton, while the alpha-subunits, whose structure is known, contain a trypsin-like triad within the framework of a unique tertiary fold. The physiological significance of the association of the two types of subunits is not known. In an effort to better understand the function of the complex we turned to genomic data mining in search of related proteins in lower eukaryotes, We found that the Drosophila melanogaster genome contains homologs of both alpha- and beta-subunits, and we cloned both genes. The alpha-subunit homolog has been overexpressed, purified and crystallized. It lacks two of the three active-site residues and, consequently, is catalytically inactive against PAF-AH (Ib) substrates, Our study shows that the beta-subunit homolog is highly conserved from Drosophila to mammals and is able to interact with the mammalian alpha-subunits but is unable to interact with the Drosophila alpha-subunit, (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The images are smooth isotropic 3D random fields of test statistics, and the event occurs when the image exceeds a fixed high threshold. We give a simple approximation to the probability of a conjunction occurring anywhere in a fixed region, so that we can test for a local increase in the mean of the images at the same unknown location in all images, a generalization of the split-t test. This is the corollary to a more general result on the expected Minkowski functionals of the set of points where a conjunction occurs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Each neuronal population expresses mRNA for several types of nicotinic cholinoceptor subunit, including alpha 16 and beta 3. In superfused rat striatal synaptosomes, epibatidine evoked release of [H-3]dopamine with similar efficacy to ACh, whereas nicotine and cytisine were weaker (70 +/- 6% and 58 +/- 6%, respectively). The four agonists were equi-efficacious in evoking [H-3]noradrenaline release from hippocampal synaptosomes. Nicotine-evoked synaptosomal release was tetrodotoxin-insensitive. Somatodendritic nicotinic cholinoceptors on dopaminergic neurons were studied using a dendrosomal [H-3]dopamine release assay and also in locomotor activity tests. In both assays, nicotine appeared more efficacious than epibatidine. Furthermore, with repeated nicotine exposure, the acute locomotor stimulant response to nicotine increased, whereas the epibatidine response became undetectable. In conclusion, somatodendritic nicotinic cholinoceptors located on dopaminergic neurons appear to differ pharmacologically from those on striatal dopaminergic terminals and hippocampal noradrenergic terminals.

Of the several subtypes of dopamine receptors, the possible role of dopamine D1-like receptors in brain functions, especially in learning and memory, has recently generated much interest. However, molecularly the D1-like receptors are comprised of at least two subtypes, namely D-l and D-5, and it has not been possible to ascertain which of these two receptor classes is responsible for these functions due to the lack of selective ligands. In the present study, utilizing a combined antisense-in vivo dialysis approach, we show that the D-5 subtype is the dopamine D1-like receptor involved in modulating hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release, a transmitter implicated in a variety of cognitive processes. This is one of the first evidence for a functional role for the D-5 receptor. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

HO-1 immunoreactivity is greatly increased in neurons and astrocytes of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of individuals with AD and colocalizes to senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Methods: We investigated whether systemic HO-1 regulation is also deranged in AD patients and whether blood HO-1 measurements provide a peripheral biomarker of the disease. Plasma HO-1 protein levels were measured by competitive ELISA and lymphocyte HO-1 mRNA levels were determined by Northern analysis in patients with early probable sporadic AD, normal elderly controls (NEC), normal younger controls, individuals with age-associated cognitive decline (AACD) not meeting AD criteria, and patients with non-Alzheimer dementia, nondementing neurologic illness, and chronic medical disorders. CSF HO-1 protein concentrations were also determined by ELISA in pathologically confirmed AD and control cases. Results: Mean plasma HO-1 protein concentrations were significantly lower in AD patients (0.85 +/- 0.14 mu g/mL) compared with NEC (1.77 +/- 0.34 mu g/mL; p < 0.05) and control patients. The AACD group exhibited plasma HO-1 concentrations (1.06 +/- 0.33 mu g/mL) intermediate between, but not different from, those of the AD patients and NEC. Lymphocyte HO-1 mRNA levels were lower in the AD cohort relative to NEC (p < 0.001) and individuals with AACD, non-Alzheimer dementia, nondementing neurologic illness, and chronic medical conditions. Lymphocyte HO-1 mRNA levels were also lower in the AACD group relative to NEC (p < 0.05). In comparison with all groups excluding AACD, the sensitivity and specificity of lymphocyte HO-1 mRNA measurement for diagnosis of early sporadic AD are 88% and 75%. Mean CSF HO-1 protein concentrations were lower (p < 0.01) in AD cases (19.07 ng/mL) relative to control values (32.48 ng/mL). Conclusions: Plasma and CSF HO-1 protein and lymphocyte HO-1 mRNA levels are decreased in subjects with sporadic AD. Quantitative assay for lymphocyte HO-1 mRNA expression may serve as a useful biologic marker in early sporadic AD.

Using the in vitro slice preparation and sharp electrode techniques, we recorded from layer V neurons located in the medial entorhinal cortex. Recorded cells were also labeled with biocytin. Based on morphological criteria, layer V of the entorhinal cortex is comprised of three categories of neurons: pyramidal cells, horizontal cells, and polymorphic cells. Horizontal cells could be easily distinguished from the pyramidal cells because the bulk of their dendritic plexus extended horizontally within layer V. Polymorphic cells vary in size and shape. Interestingly, they typically do not have apical dendrites, and some of them have dendrites that extend into the subiculum. Based on electrophysiological criteria alone, it was not possible to unequivocally distinguish the morphological cell types because they were somewhat heterogeneous with respect to several parameters including inward rectification, spike-frequency adaptation, and intrinsic oscillations. Nevertheless, although most horizontal cells displayed time-dependent inward rectification, most pyramidal cells displayed fast inward rectification exclusively. None of the entorhinal cortex layer V cells displayed oscillatory activity like that of neocortical layer V "bursting" cells, although neurons from all groups displayed rhythmic subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. In summary, we have found that layer V of the rat medial entorhinal cortex consists of three morphologically distinct neuronal subtypes that cannot be clearly distinguished from each other by traditional electrophysiological measures.

A conserved N-terminal disulfide bond is necessary for sorting of chromogranins in neuroendocrine PC12 cells. Surprisingly, this disulfide bond is not necessary for sorting of chromogranins in endocrine GH4C1 cells, To investigate the sorting mechanism in GH4C1 cells, we made several mutant forms removing highly conserved N- and C-terminal regions of bovine chromogranin A. Removing the conserved N-terminal disulfide bond and the conserved C-terminal dimerization and tetramerization domain did not affect the sorting of chromogranin A to the regulated secretory pathway. In contrast, removing the C-terminal 90 amino acids of chromogranin A caused rerouting to the constitutive secretory pathway and impaired aggregation properties as compared with wildtype chromogranin A, Since this mutant was sorted to the regulated secretory pathway in PC12 cells, these results demonstrate that chromogranins contain independent N- and C-terminal sorting domains that function in a cell type-specific manner. Moreover, this is the first evidence that low pH/calcium-induced aggregation is necessary for sorting of a chromogranin to the regulated secretory pathway of endocrine cells.

The rat 5-HT1A receptor gene is regulated by a proximal TATA-driven promoter and by upstream repressors that inhibit gene expression. Deletion of a 71-base pair (bp) segment between -1590/-1519 bp of the 5-HT1A receptor gene induced over 10-fold enhancement of transcriptional activity in both 5-HT1A receptor-expressing (RN46A raphe and SN48 septal) cells and receptor-negative (L6 myoblast and C6 glioma) cells. A 31-bp segment of the repressor was protected from DNase I digestion by RN46A or L6 nuclear extracts. Within the 31-bp segment, a single protein complex was present in receptor-expressing cells that bound a novel 14-bp DNA element; in receptor-negative: cells, an additional complex bound an adjacent 12-bp sequence. In receptor-positive but not receptor-negative cells, mutation of the 14-bp element to eliminate protein binding abrogated repression to nearly the same extent as deletion of the -1590/-1519 bp segment. Additional mutation of both 14-bp and 12-bp elements abolished protein binding and repressor activity in receptor-negative cells. Thus a single protein-DNA complex at the 14-bp element represses the 5-HT1A receptor gene in 5-HT1A receptor-positive neuronal cells, whereas adjacent DNA elements provide a dual repression mechanism in 5-HT1A receptor-negative cells.

GTP caused the strongest inhibition of the three enzymes, as measured by fluorescence assays using gelatin or elastin as substrates. The inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 caused by GTP was confirmed by gelatin zymography and was observed for MMPs associated with both various rat tissues and human brain tumors (glioblastoma and pituitary tumors). The activities of MMPs were also measured in the presence of various catechins isolated from green tea including (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epicatechin gallate(ECG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)epicatechin (EC) and (+)-catechin (C). The most potent inhibitors of these activities, as measured by fluorescence and by gelatin or casein zymography, were EGCG and EGG. GTP and the different catechins had no effect on pancreatic elastase, suggesting that the effects of these molecules on MMP activities are specific. Furthermore, in vitro activation of proMMP-2 secreted from the glioblastomas cell line U-87 by the lectin concanavalin A was completely inhibited by GTP and specifically by EGCG. These results indicate that catechins from green tea inhibit MMP activities and proMMP-2 activation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Flerobuterol was delivered at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/day using osmotic pumps implanted s.c. The 2-day flerobuterol treatment significantly increased plasma Trp, both free and total, and decreased plasma Leu and Ile. This resulted in a significant increase in the facilitated transport of Trp. There was a significant increase in the synthesis of 5-HT in the 2-day treatment group in the dorsal and median raphe as well as in all postsynaptic structures, with the exception of the hypothalamus. In contrast, after a 14-day treatment, the enhanced facilitated transport of Trp was no longer present, and the increase in the rate of 5-HT synthesis persisted only in the parietal and occipital cortex and the superior colliculus. These data suggest that flerobuterol, similar to other beta-adrenergic agonists, acutely increases 5-HT synthesis, in part, through an elevation of brain Trp availability.

As the normal development of these functions is influenced by medullary opioid systems, the present study explored the possible contribution of the opioid systems to the attenuation induced by cocaine. Methionine-enkephalin (metenkephalin), an endogenous opioid peptide, was delineated by immunocytochemistry in respiratory- and arousal-related medullary regions of relatively immature (6-7-day-old) and more mature piglets (20-21-day-old). The animals were either unexposed, or exposed prenatally to 2 mg/kg cocaine four times daily administered to the pregnant sows intravenously throughout the last third of gestation. At control, met-enkephalin was found in the neurons, fibers and terminals of the respiratory- and arousal-related medullary regions throughout the age range studied. Prenatal cocaine exposure increased met-enkephalin immunoreactivity in the respiratory-related hypoglossal and solitary tract nuclei of both age groups. These findings support a modulatory role of met-enkephalin in the normal development of respiratory control, and an involvement of this peptide in the attenuation of respiration by repeated prenatal exposure to cocaine.

The N-terminal SH3 domain (SH3A), unlike other SH3 domains from intersectin or various endocytic proteins, specifically inhibits intermediate events leading to the formation of clathrin-coated pits. We have now identified a brain-enriched, 170 kDa protein (p170) that interacts specifically with SH3A. Screening of combinatorial peptides reveals the optimal ligand for SH3A as Pp(V/I)PPR, and the 170 kDa mammalian son-of-sevenless (mSos1) protein, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, contains two copies of the matching sequence, PPVPPR. Immunodepletion studies confirm that p170 is mSos1. Intersectin and mSos1 are co-enriched in nerve terminals and are co-immunoprecipitated from brain extracts. SH3A competes with the SH3 domains of Grb2 in binding to mSos1, and the intersectin-mSos1 complex can be separated from Grb2 by sucrose gradient centrifugation, Overexpression of the SH3 domains of intersectin blocks epidermal growth factor-mediated Ras activation. These results suggest that intersectin functions in cell signaling in addition to its role in endocytosis and may link these cellular processes.

To study the physiology of lamina I neurons in slices, a clear delineation of this layer can be greatly advantageous. Yet, it has remained difficult to distinguish this layer in live tissue in conventional transverse spinal slices because of its very narrow thickness at the edge of the dorsal horn. We describe here the criteria we used to delineate lamina I in live tissue using gradient contrast videomicroscopy in 400 mu m-thick parasagittal spinal cord slices from adult rats (30-60-day-old). Because of the longitudinal orientation of the neurons in this layer, the resulting distinctive reticulated appearance of lamina I made it possible to readily distinguish it from lamina II. The usefulness of this distinguishing parameter is demonstrated by our ability to contrast synaptic properties of neurons in lamina I from those in lamina II. Complete morphological identification of lamina I neurons however also requires visualization of the eel in the horizontal plane. To maintain compatibility with the parasagittal slice, we used 3D reconstructions from confocal images of the recorded neurons. Rotation of the neuron in space allowed for its morphological characterization in all three planes (horizontal, parasagittal, and transverse). This approach therefore presents optimal conditions for systematic electrophysiological recording from visually identified lamina I neurons. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Although volumes of brain substructures are known to change during development(2), detailed maps of these dynamic growth processes have been unavailable. Here we report the creation of spatially complex, four-dimensional quantitative maps of growth patterns in the developing human brain, detected using a tensor mapping strategy with greater spatial detail and sensitivity than previously obtainable. By repeatedly scanning children (aged 3-15 years) across time spans of up to four years, a rostro-caudal wave of growth was detected at the corpus callosum, a fibre system that relays information between brain hemispheres. Peak growth rates, in fibres innervating association and language cortices, were attenuated after puberty, and contrasted sharply with a severe, spatially localized loss of subcortical grey matter. Conversely, at ages 3-6 years, the fastest growth rates occurred in frontal networks that regulate the planning of new actions. Local rates, profiles, and principal directions of growth were visualized in each individual child.

We report here that eIF4E rescued rat embryo fibroblasts ectopically expressing c-Myc (REF/Myc) from genotoxic and non-genotoxic cytostatic drugs and identify cyclin D1 as a downstream effector in the antiapoptotic mechanism, In clones of REF/Myc ectopically expressing eIF4E, resistance to apoptosis paralleled steady state levels of cyclin D1. Stable expression of cyclin D1 in REF/Myc inhibited apoptosis in response to a broad range of cell cycle specific cytostatic agents, Partial loss-of-cyclin D1 function in REF/Myc ectopically expressing eIF4E (REF/Myc/4E) significantly increased chemosensitivity; either soluble antisense cyclin D1 oligomers or transfection with a dominant negative cyclin D1 mutant that prevents translocation of cyclin D-dependent kinases to the nucleus, significantly blunted the antiapoptotic effect of eIF4E, These data directly link eIF4E rescue from cytostatic drugs to cyclin D1, Since overexpression of eIF4E and cyclin D1 is observed in many aggressive forms of chemoresistant cancers, these findings provide insight into possible mechanisms responsible for this biological behavior.

Pharmacological analyses revealed that H-i(+)-activated Na-22(+) influx mediated by NHE5 was inhibited by several classes of drugs (amiloride compounds, 3-methylsulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl guanidine methanesulfonate, cimetidine, and harmaline) at half-maximal concentrations that were intermediate to those determined for the high affinity NHE1 and the low affinity NHE3 isoforms, but closer to the latter. Kinetic analyses showed that the extracellular Na+ dependence of NHE5 activity followed a simple hyperbolic relationship with an apparent affinity constant (K-Na) of 18.6 +/- 1.6 mM. By contrast to other NHE isoforms, NHE5 also exhibited a first-order dependence on the intracellular H+ concentration, achieving half-maximal activation at pH 6.43 +/- 0.08. Extracellular monovalent cations, such as H+ and Li+, but not K+, acted as effective competitive inhibitors of Na-22(+) influx by NHE5. In addition, the transport activity of NHE5 was highly dependent on cellular ATP levels. Overall, these functional features distinguish NHE5 from other family members and closely resemble those of an amiloride-resistant NHE isoform identified in hippocampal neurons.

Detrusor hyperreflexia and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia develop with repeated urinary tract infection, stone formation, vesicoureteral reflux, renal parenchymal loss and renal failure. Over the last decade, there are many reports about new experimental techniques for application of neurostimulation to the sacral roots with variable success rate. Sacral root neuromodulation is one of the relatively recent concepts for the treatment of various voiding and storage dysfunctions. The indications of neuromodulation have been extended to include many diagnostic entities including urge and sensory incontinence, idiopathic chronic urinary retention, pelvic pain and interstitial cystitis. Despite the extensive amount of research and clinical papers cited in this article and others concerning the different modalities for application of electrostimulation or electromodulation to recuperate the bladder function and decrease its outlet resistance, the overall results are still supoptimal. We believe that a simple technique of sacral root neurostimulation with high selectivity and long term results will be optimal for future human application. Further exploration of neuropathological changes and understanding the possible reflex mechanism after disconnection of sacral micturition center from its higher control with continous improvement of the stimulation system and electric waveforms will help solve many current problems.

This exploratory study assessed the associations between exposure to neurotoxic agents in the workplace, mental health, and marital difficulties. Methods Fifty-five (55) male workers and their spouses completed standardized measures of mental health and marital difficulties. Workers' exposure to neurotoxic substances was evaluated by questionnaire avid interview using a semiquantitative classification system. Results A positive relation was observed between exposure level and measures of workers' psychological symptoms and marital stress; no relation was observed between workers' exposure level and wives' psychological symptoms. More severe exposure to neurotoxic substances was associated with wives' reports of more severe marital conflicts, and this association was mediated by husbands' psychological symptoms. As compared to low exposure husbands, high exposure husbands reported higher degrees of stress surrounding marital discussions, move consistent incidence of minor physical assaults try wives, and stronger associations between their levels of stress, the verbal aggressions of wives, and the number of marital conflicts. Conclusions The results of this study confirm that neurotoxic exposure is a risk factor for mental health and suggest how this may influence marital relations. Because of the importance of these findings for the well-being of workers and their families, these associations should further studied (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Patients and methods: Patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme receiving a stable dose of steroids and ECOG performance status less than or equal to 3 were eligible for this study at the time of first relapse. One adjuvant chemotherapy regimen was permissible. Patients received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) i.v. weekly x 3, repeated on a four-weekly cycle. Results: Of 20 patients enrolled, 15 were evaluable for response, 19 for non-hematological toxicity and 18 for hematological toxicity. Seven patients had anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and twelve glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Age ranged from 28-71 years (median 50). Fifteen patients discontinued therapy due to disease progression. The median number of cycles administered was 1 (range 1-11); only two patients received more than three cycles. Hematologic toxicity was acceptable and no grade 4 toxicity was seen. One patient developed Pneumocystis pneumonia and eventual pulmonary embolism; one died of gastric hemorrhage related to steroid therapy. No objective responses were seen. Nine patients had stable disease (median duration 2.7 months, range 0.9-11.2). Conclusions: Gemcitabine given in this dose and schedule seems well tolerated but is not active in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.

Methods: Sixty-five patients in this multicenter double-blind study were randomly assigned to olanzapine (5-20 mg), risperidone (4-10 mg), or haloperidol (5-20 mg). Standard measures of clinical and motor syndromes were administered, as well as a comprehensive battery of tests to assess (1) motor skills, (2) attention span, (3) verbal fluency and reasoning, (4) nonverbal fluency and construction, (5) executive skills, and (6) immediate recall at baseline and after 6, 30, and 54 weeks of treatment. Results: The general cognitive index derived from the 6 domain scores revealed a significantly greater benefit from treatment with olanzapine relative to haloperidol and olanzapine relative to risperidone, but no significant difference was shown between risperidone and haloperidol. The improvement related to olanzapine was apparent after 6 weeks and enhanced after 30 and 54 weeks of treatment. Exploratory within-group analyses of the 6 cognitive domains after a conservative Bonferroni adjustment revealed a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the immediate recall domain, and similar analyses of the 17 individual tests revealed a significant improvement with olanzapine only on the Hooper Visual Organization Test. Conclusions: These data suggest that olanzapine has some superior cognitive benefits relative to haloperidol and risperidone. A larger sample replication study is necessary to confirm and generalize the observations of this study and begin evaluation of the implications of this change to cerebral function and quality of life for people with schizophrenia.

In the rat colon (a Y-2/Y-4 bioassay), BIIE0246 (1 mu M) completely blocked the contraction induced by PYY3-36, but not that of [Leu(31),Pro(34)]NPY (a Y-1, Y-4 and Y-5 agonist) and hPP (a Y-4 and Y-5 agonist). Additionally, BIIE0246 failed to alter the contractile effects of NPY in prototypical Y-1 in vitro bioassays. 5 Taken together, these results demonstrate that BIIE0246 is a highly potent, high affinity antagonist selective for the Y-2 receptor subtype. It should prove most useful to establish further the functional role of the Y-2 receptor in the organism.

Combinations were compared with mivacurium and rocuronium, with respect to onset, intubating conditions, and duration of action in young and elderly adults. Methods: Fentanyl-propofol-N2O-isoflurane anesthesia was given to ASA I and II adults aged 18-65 yr (45 patients) and over 66 yr (45 patients), In this blinded randomized study, we compared accelerographic adductor pollicis response and visual assessment of response to facial nerve stimulation after 0.25 mg.kg(-1) mivacurium, 0.6 mg.kg(-1) rocuronium, and a combination of 0.08 mg.kg(-1) mivacurium plus 0.2 mg.kg(-1) rocuronium. Intubating conditions at 2.5 min were rated as excellent, good, fair or poor. Results: Onset times were similar for all drugs regimens and for both age groups (204-276 sec at the thumb; 142-196 sec at the eye) (P < 0.05 between muscles). Intubating conditions were similar in all groups, and rated good or excellent, except in two subjects, In young patients duration to 25% recovery was longer (P < 0.05) for rocuronium (mean +/- SD) (39 +/- 11 min) than for either mivacurium (23 +/- 6 min), or the combination (27 +/- 7 min). Duration was prolonged in the elderly for rocuronium (54 +/- 17 min), and the combination ( 35 +/- 11 min), but not for mivacurium (24 +/- 6 min), Conclusions: Mivacurium-rocuronium combinations yield onset times and intubating conditions similar to either parent agent with only two thirds as much total drug. Duration for such a mixture is similar to that of mivacurium in young adults and slightly prolonged in the elderly.

We tested (i) the hypothesis that cerebrovascular autoregulation is impaired during early onset group B streptococcal (GBS) meningitis, (ii) whether this impairment is regulated by vasoactive mediators such as prostaglandins and (or) nitric oxide (NO), and (iii) whether this impairment is preventable by specific and (or) nonspecific inhibitors: dexamethasone, ibuprofen, and N omega-nitro-L-arginine, a NO inhibitor. Sterile saline or 10(9) colony-forming units (cfu) of heat-killed GBS was injected into the cerebral ventricle of newborn piglets. CBF autoregulation was determined by altering cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) with balloon-tipped catheters placed in the aorta. GBS produced a narrow range of CBF autoregulation due to an impairment at the upper limit of CPP. We report that in vivo in the early stages (first 2 h) of induced GBS inflammation (i) GBS impairs the upper limit of cerebrovascular autoregulation; (ii) ibuprofen, dexamethasone, and N omega-nitro-L-arginine not only prevent this GBS-induced autoregulatory impairment but improve the range of cerebrovascular autoregulation; (iii) these autoregulatory changes do not involve circulating cerebral prostanoids; and (iv) the observed changes correlate with the induction of NO synthase gene expression. Thus, acute early onset GBS-induced impairment of the upper limit of CBF autoregulation can be correlated with increases of NO synthase production, suggesting that NO is a vasoactive mediator of CBF.

High levels of immunoreactive alpha(1A)AR and alpha(1D)AR in brain and heart and of alpha(1B)AR in liver and heart of neonatal rats were detected. In adult rat tissues, the abundance of alpha(1A)AR protein was most marked in the brain, intermediate in heart, aorta, liver, vas deferens, and adrenals, and minimal in the kidney and prostate; relative to other tissues, the expression of alpha(1B)AR was higher in brain and heart and that of alpha(1D)AR in brain. All the three receptor subtypes increased with age in the brain cortex, whereas the abundance of alpha(1B)AR increased in the heart but decreased in the liver; alpha(1A)AR and alpha(1D)AR in liver, kidney, and heart were not affected by age. It is concluded that alpha(1)AR subtypes are widely expressed in different neonatal and adult rat tissues.

Recent anatomical evidence suggests that sst1 and sst2 may be involved in the central regulation of GH secretion. Given the lack of specific receptor antagonists, we used selective antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) to test the hypothesis that one or both of these subtypes are involved in the intrahypothalamic network regulating pulsatile GH secretion. In mouse neuronal hypothalamic cultures the proportion of GHRK neurons coexpressing sst1 or sst2 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) was identical. In contrast, sst1 mRNAs were more often present than sst2 in SRIH-expressing neurons. Firstly, sst1 antisense ODN in vitro treatment abolished sst1, but not sst2, receptor modulation of glutamate sensitivity and decreased sst1, but not sst2, mRNAs. The reverse was true after treatment with sst2 antisense; Sense ODNs did not alter the effects of SRIH agonists. In a second series of experiments, nonanaesthetized adult male rats were infused for 120 h intracerebroventricularly with ODNs. Only the sst1 antisense ODN diminished the amplitude of ultradian GH pulses without modifying their frequency. In parallel, sst1 antisense ODN strongly diminished sst1 immunoreactivity in the anterior periventricular nucleus and median eminence, as well as sst1 periventricular nucleus mRNA levels. The effectiveness of the ssta antisense ODN was attested by the inhibition of hypothalamic binding of [I-125]Tyr(0)- D-Trp(8)-SRIH. Scrambled ODNs had no effect on GH secretion or on sst mRNAs or SRIH binding levels. These results favor a preferential involvement of sst1 receptors in the intrahypothalamic regulation of GH secretion by SRIH.

Because it disrupts brain maturation, it has long been thought to produce non-specific consequences such as mental deficiency and behavioral problems. However, advances in medical knowledge have shown that childhood epilepsy should not be considered as a single disorder, and it is now becoming apparent that various clinical entities have different cognitive expressions that yet need to be specified. The purpose of this paper is to provide an up-to-date analysis of this multi-faceted pathology. The first section is devoted to the characterization of the neuropsychological profile that accompanies focal epilepsies, as defined by the site of the epileptic process. We report the first group study of children with frontal robe epilepsy. The results indicate that frontal lobe epilepsy produces symptoms (deficits of planning, attention and motor dexterity) that are akin to those found in frontal-lesioned adults. Similarly, like in adults, temporal lobe epilepsy produces memory impairment in children as well as behavioral and academic disturbances. Occipito-parietal lobe epilepsy is rare in children and its effects still need to be specified. The second section deals with the neuropsychological techniques used in presurgical evaluation. Finally, the various neurosurgical procedures that are increasingly being used as part of the arsenal of epilepsy treatment are described along with the neuropsychological findings that are associated with these interventions. It can be concluded that the beneficial effects of epilepsy surgery (callosotomy, hemispherectomy, temporal and extra-temporal resections) by far outweigh the few cognitive deficits that are occasionally reported following these interventions.

A CTG repeat was proposed to function as a potential repressor element in nonpermissive cells, and a sequence similar to the JC virus silencer element was found to function as a negative element in permissive primary astrocytes. The objective of this study was to characterize further the mechanisms governing cell-type specific MT-3 gene transcription. We searched for a suitable cell line expressing the MT-3 gene to be used for determination of MT-3 promoter tissue specificity, and showed that MT-3 expression is activated during neuroectodermal differentiation of P19 cells induced by retinoic acid to levels similar to those found in whole brain. Deletion of the CTG repeat or of the JC virus silencer did not promote MT-3 promoter activity in nonpermissive cells, or enhance expression in permissive cells. We identified MT-3 promoter sequences interacting with liver and brain nuclear proteins, as assayed by DNase I footprinting analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and assessed the role of these sequences in the regulation of MT-3 expression by cotransfection experiments. We generated stable transfectants in permissive C6 and nonpermissive NIH-3T3 cells, and analysed the methylation status of the MT-3 gene. These studies show that regulation of tissue-specific MT-3 gene expression does not appear to involve a repressor, and suggest that other mechanisms such as chromatin organization and epigenetic modifications could account for the absence of MT-3 gene transcription in nonpermissive cells.

UB-VERTICAL-BAR; BEAUTY HADRONS; HEAVY QUARKS; DETECTOR; LEP; GAMMA(Z(0)->B(B)OVER-BAR)/GAMMA(Z(0)->HADRONS); FRAGMENTATION; RESONANCE; LEPTONS	A measurement of inclusive semileptonic branching fractions of b hadrons produced in Z(0) decays is presented. An enriched Z(0) --> b (b) over bar sample is obtained with a lifetime flavour-tagging technique. The leptonic events are then selected from, this sample, and classified according to their origin, which is determined by comparing the distribution of several kinematic variables using artificial neural network techniques. Using 3.6 million multihadronic events collected with the OPAL detector at energies near the Z(0) resonance, the values BR(b --> lX) = (10.84 +/- 0.09 (stat.) +/- 0.21 (syst.) (+0.21)(-0.13) (model)) BR(b --> c --> lX) = (8.39 +/- 0.15 (stat.) +/- 0.22 (syst.) -(+0.33)(0.29) (model)). are measured, where b denotes all weakly decaying b hadrons and l represents either e or mu The second error includes all experimental systematic uncertainties whereas the last error is due to uncertainties in modelling of the lepton momentum spectrum in semileptonic decays and b quark fragmentation. The average fraction of the beam energy carrried by the weakly decaying b hadron, < x(E)> is measured to be < x(E)> = 0.709 +/- 0.003 (stat.) +/- 0.003 (syst.) +/- 0.013 (model) where the modelling error is dominated by the choice of b fragmentation model. The agreement between data and various semileptonic decay models and fragmentation functions is also investigated.

TRNs were antidromically identified by electrical stimulation of the predorsal bundle. The auto- and cross-correlation histograms of visual responses of both types of neurones were recorded and analysed. A delayed, sharp peak in cross-correlograms allowed us to verify whether SLN and TRN cells were coupled; in addition, oscillatory activities were compared to verify if rhythmic responses of SLN sites were transmitted to TRN sites. We found that oscillatory activity was rarely observed in spontaneous activity of superficial (1/74) and TRN sites (1/48). Moving light bars induced oscillation in 31% (23/74) of the superficial-layer and in 23% (11/48) of the TRN sites. The strength of the rhythmic responses was determined by specific ranges of stimulus velocity in 83% (19/23) and 64% (7/11) of oscillating SLN and TRN sites, respectively. Frequencies of oscillations ranged between 5 and 125 Hz and were confined, for 53% of the cells, to the 5-20 Hz band. Thus, the bandwidth of frequencies of the stimulus-related oscillations in the superior colliculus was broader than the gamma range. Analysis of cross-correlation histograms revealed a significant predominant peak with a mean delay of 2.7+/-0.9 ms in 46% (17/37) of SLN-TRN pairs. Most correlated SLN-TRN pairs (88%: 15/17) had superimposed receptive fields, suggesting they were functionally interconnected. However, individual oscillatory frequencies of correlated and oscillatory SLN and TRN cells were never the same (0/8). Together, these results suggest that the neurones in collicular superficial layer contact TRNs and, consequently, support the idea that the superficial layers contribute to collicular outputs producing eye- and head-orienting movements.

The present study aimed to establish the presence of NPY Y-1 receptors on cultured hippocampal astrocytes using similar strategies. Immunocytochemical experiments were carried out using three antisera directed against distinct domains (amino adds sequence 185-203, 198-213 and 355-382) of the Y-1 receptor. Double-labeling experiments and confocal microscopy with these Y-1 receptor antisera demonstrated their recognition of the same sub-population (20%) of GFAP-positive astrocytes in culture. The immunostaining seen with all three Y-1 receptor antisera took the form of large irregular clusters distributed throughout cell bodies and processes. Further experiments using radioactive ligands confirmed the, presence of NPY receptors on cultured hippocampal astrocytes. Emulsion receptor autoradiography using a newly developed ligand, [I-125]GR231118 in the presence of PYY, hPP or BIBP3226 (1 mu M), pharmacologically established the Y-1 nature of these receptors. Specific [I-125]GR231118 binding was competed by PYY and the selective Y-1 antagonist BIBP3226 but not by hPP (a Y-4/Y-5 agonist) . Similar autoradiographic labeling patterns were obtained using [I-125][Leu(31).Pro(34)]PYY (a Y-1/Y-4/Y-5 agonist)whereas [I-112]PYY3-36 (a Y-2/Y-5 agonist) failed to generate any specific signal. Hence, rat cultured hippocampal astrocytes express a typical Y-1 receptor without evidence for the presence of Y-2, Y-4 or Y-5 subtypes. These data suggest a preferential regulation by NPY, acting via the Y-1 receptors, of astrocytic function. GLIA 30.82-91, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In this paper we report the detailed characterization of the immune cell response as well as changes in the expression of cell adhesion molecules and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier after microinjection of LPC into the adult mouse spinal cord. T cells and neutrophils were seen in the spinal cord 6-12 h after LPG injection, but not in PBS-injected mice. Mac-1+ monocytes were also seen at 6 h and 12 h in the white and gray matter of mice injected with LPC and PBS but were significantly greater in the white matter after LPC injections. At later time points LPC induced an increase in the number of activated Mac-1+ macrophages that displayed a variety of morphologies in the white and gray matter. These cells were not present in PBS-injected control mice. LPC also induced widespread microglial activation in the white and gray matter. The number of these Mac-1+ microglia reduced drastically at 96 h after LPG injection suggesting that they may have transformed into Mac-1+ phagocytic cells with a different morphology. These LPC-induced changes in immune cells were accompanied by significant increases in VCAM-1+ and ICAM-1+ blood vessels in the spinal cord. In addition, LPC induced a rapid and widespread disruption of the blood-brain barrier, as compared to PBS injected mice. Therefore, LPC can induce an early and transient T cell and neutrophil response in the CNS. These cells likely promote the rapid influx of monocytes followed by widespread and effective activation of macrophages that mediate rapid phagocytosis of myelin debris. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Our laboratory isolated a novel rho GTPase-activating protein (rhoGAP) gene named ARHGAP6 from the MLS region. ARHGAP6 contains 14 exons encoding a 974 amino acid protein with three putative SH3-binding domains. Because exons 2-14 are deleted in all MLS patients, we hypothesized that ARHGAP6 may be responsible for some of the phenotypic features of MLS. We pursued two approaches to study the function of ARHGAP6 and its role in the pathogenesis of MLS: gene targeting of the rhoGAP domain in mouse embryonic stem cells and in vitro expression studies, Surprisingly, loss of the rhoGAP function of Arhgap6 does not cause any detectable phenotypic or behavioral abnormalities in the mutant mice, Transfected mammalian cells expressing ARHGAP6 lose their actin stress fibers, retract from the growth surface and extend thin, branching processes resembling filopodia, The ARHGAP6 protein co-localizes with actin filaments through an N-terminal domain and recruits F-actin into the growing processes, Mutation of a conserved arginine residue in the rhoGAP domain prevents the loss of stress fibers but has little effect on process outgrowth. These results suggest that ARHGAP6 has two independent functions: one as a GAP with specificity for RhoA and the other as a cytoskeletal protein that promotes actin remodeling.

In these studies, a cause-effect relationship between biological variables and cognitive deficits, sometimes complex due to multiple agents, has been hypothesised. As for the psychosocial consequences, adaptation to the cancer-related stress has been the main focus, at both the individual and family levels. In this paper, we advocate the use of a global model for the development of handicap, derived from the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH) by the World Health Organisation. This revised model proposes that handicap is the result of complex interactions between the characteristics of a person's impairment, disabilities, and the characteristics of the environment. At each of these levels? risk/resilience factors are defined. This means that depending on the environmental obstacles they face, persons with an impairment or a disability may or may not experience a situation creating a handicap which is no longer seen as a stable status resulting from a disease to which the individual must adapt. By reviewing animal and clinical studies, current knowledge pertaining to leukaemia sequelae are integrated into the different levels defined by the model: organic impairment, disabilities, environmental obstacles, and handicap situation. Practical implications for research, policies, and individual treatments, and comparisons with existing models, are also outlined.

In contrast, sustained desipramine administration for 2 and 21 d (10 mg/kg.d) robustly reduced LC Bring activity, though only to the same extent, following these two treatment periods. The enhancement of the firing rate of LC neurons produced by the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (10-50 mu g/kg, i.v.) in desipramine- and citalopram-treated rats was abolished, indicating a desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors. However, the attenuation of the Bring rate of LC neurons induced by the 5-HT2 agonist DOI (5-50 mu g/kg, i.v.) was decreased approx. 2-fold in citalopram-treated rats but not significantly altered in desipramine-treated rats. Since 5-HT neurons exert a tonic inhibitory effect on LC neurons, it appears that enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission by sustained SSRI administration leads to a reduction of the firing rate of noradrenergic neurons. In conclusion, SSRIs attenuate the activity of noradrenergic neurons with a delay that is consistent with their beneficial effect in depression and some anxiety disorders, such as panic, generalized and social anxiety disorders. However, given the hyperadrenergic state often observed in anxiogenic conditions the latter phenomenon is believed to contribute more to the anxiolytic effect of SSRIs than to their antidepressant action.

Patients and Methods: Patients with previously untreated NSCLC were randomized to receive either tirapazamine (390 mg/m(2) infused over 2 hours) followed 1 hour later by cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) over 1 hour) or 75 mg/m(2) of cisplatin alone, every 3 weeks for a maximum of eight cycles. Results: A total of 446 patients with NSCLC (17% with stage IIIB disease and pleural effusions: 83% with stage IV disease) were entered onto the study. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was greater than or equal to 60 for all patients (for 10%, KPS = 60; for 90%, KPS = 70 to 100). Sixty patients (14%) had clinically stable brain metastases. The median survival was significantly longer (34.6 v 27.7 weeks; P = .0078) and the response rate was significantly greater (27.5% v 13.7%; P < .001) for patients who received tirapazamine plus cisplatin (n = 218) than for those who received cisplatin alone in = 219). The tirapazamine-plus-cisplatin regimen was associated with mild to moderate adverse events, including acute, reversible hearing loss, reversible, intermittent muscle cramping, diarrhea, skin rash, nausea, and vomiting. There were no incremental increases in my elosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, or renal, hepatic, or cardiac toxicity and no deaths related to tirapazamine. Conclusion: The CATAPULT 1 study shows that tirapazamine enhances the activity of cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC and confirms that hypoxia is an exploitable therapeutic target in human malignancies.

In the rat, this treatment increases hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and dampens plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses to stressors. The objectives of this study were to determine whether neonatal handling of pigs would effect permanent changes in plasma corticosteroid binding capacity (CBG), basal or stresser-induced plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations, brain or pituitary GR levels, dexamethasone suppression of plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations, behaviour in an open field-test pen, and body weights. Twelve litters of pigs were randomly assigned to either neonatal handling or no disturbance. Handled litters were removed from the farrowing crate for 10 min per day for the first 14 days of life. Male pigs were kept for the study and the boars were weighed monthly. At 7 months of age, boars were tested for locomotory behaviour in an open field-test pen. The boars were implanted with indwelling ear-vein catheters and blood samples were obtained basally, during and after application of a nose snare, and after 0.04 mg/kg dexamethasone. Boars were killed and blood samples were obtained and the brain and pituitary glands collected. Handled boars had greater (P<0.05) plasma CBG binding and lower basal total (P<0.05) and calculated free (P<0.03) plasma cortisol concentrations. No significant differences between treatments were found in plasma ACTH or cortisol responses to a nose-snare stressor; however, when killed, handled boars had greater (P<0.02) plasma ACTH concentrations. Handled and non-handled boars did not: differ in plasma ACTH or cortisol responses to dexamethasone. There was no treatment effect on GR expression in the pituitary gland, frontal cortex, hippocampus, or hypothalamus. Behaviourally, the handled boars had higher (P<0.03) locomotor scores over inner squares and a lower (P<0.05) ratio of outer:inner squares entered in open field-tests. During the first 7 months of life, body weights were lower (P<0.004) for handled boars. In conclusion, neonatal handling permanently altered HPA function in pigs, but in a manner dissimilar to that found in the rat. These changes induced in the pig were not beneficial for commercial production with respect to body weight.

Using an in vivo stimulation and recording technique, we provide evidence for both sensory and motor functions in the mesocerebral neuronal population. Some neurones were specifically sensitive to tactile stimuli delivered to the skin on the superior tentacles and around the genital pore. Electrical stimulation of the right mesocerebrum evoked genital eversion and, in combination with tactile stimulation, dart-shooting and penial eversion. Genital eversions were also elicited by injections of APGWamide. During courtship, one recorded unit increased its activity only in correlation with penial eversion, while six other units increased their activity only during dart-shooting. Three additional units increased their activity during both types of behaviour. In addition, most of the recorded units showed increased neuronal activity during times of contact with a partner. Comparison of our results with available data from other molluscs leads us to conclude that the right anteromedial region of the cerebral ganglion is an evolutionarily conserved region of the gastropod brain specialised for the control of male mating behaviour. It is striking to find such functional conservation in the central nervous system of phylogenetically distant gastropods given the large differences in behaviour during mating.

In AD a reduction in CBF/trkA-containing neurons has been suggested to trigger a hyperexpression of galaninergic fibers within the nucleus basalis subfield of the basal forebrain, The present study examined the interrelationship between reductions in CBF/trkA-containing neurons and the overexpression of galaninergic fibers within the nucleus basalis in DS, Within the nucleus basalis stereologic evaluation revealed a 46% reduction in the number of trkA-immunopositive neurons, whereas optical density measurements displayed a nonsignificant 18% reduction in neuronal trkA immunoreactivity in DS as compared with age-matched controls. Western blot analysis also showed a significant reduction in cortical trkA protein levels in DS. A semiquantitative examination of galaninergic fibers in the nucleus basalis revealed only a modest hypertrophy of galaninergic fibers within the nucleus basalis in DS. The present findings indicate a significant reduction in trkA within the nucleus basalis and cortex with only a moderate hypertrophy of galaninergic fibers in DS. These observations suggest that DS may not be an exact genetic model for investigation of changes in the AD basal forebrain.

They represent the most frequent malignant pediatric brain tumors, but their origin still remains unresolved and controversial. IMB cells correspond to different stages of neural development and differentiation as illustrated by their expression of neuronal and glial markers. In the present study, we examined the expression pattern of the common low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR) in a series of 167 MBs by immunohistochemistry. While p75(NTR) was present in only 17% of classic MBs (CMB), we found expression of p75(NTR) in all desmoplastic (nodular) MBs (DMB) examined, and in 71% of those MBs with a significant desmoplastic component. Furthermore, both desmoplastic histology and p75(NTR) expression were present preferentially in those tumors of adolescents and adults that are frequently located laterally in the cerebellar hemispheres. In DMBs, p75(NTR) was expressed predominantly in the proliferative, reticulin-rich areas, which may show coexpression of GFAP. In the pale islands of DMB, p75(NTR) was expressed only weakly or was absent. The expression pattern showed an inverse relation to that of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin that was predominant in p75(NTR) negative classic MBs. Since the neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR) is expressed in cells of the external granule cell layer (EGL) of the fetal cerebellum, our findings suggest that progenitor cells of the EGL are the cellular origin of a distinct subset of MB, namely the desmoplastic variant and MBs with a significant desmoplastic component.

Using simultaneous field potential and [K+](o) recordings, we found that entorhinal and dentate ictal epileptiform discharges were accompanied by comparable elevations in [K+](o) (up to 12 mM from a baseline value of 3.2 mM), whereas smaller rises in [K+](o), (up to 6 mM) were associated with ictal activity in CA3. Cutting the Schaffer collaterals disclosed the occurrence of ictal discharges that were associated with larger rises in [K+](o) as compared with the intact slice. Further lesion of the perforant path blocked ictal activity and the associated [K+](o) increases in the dentate gyms, indicating synaptic propagation to this area. Time delay measurements demonstrated that ictal epileptiform activity in the intact hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slice propagated via the trisynaptic path. However, after Schaffer collateral cut, ictal discharges continued to occur in CA1 and subiculum and spread to these areas directly from the entorhinal cortex. Thus our data indicate that the increased epileptogenicity of the dentate gyrus (a prominent feature of temporal lobe epilepsy as well), may depend on perforant path propagation of entorhinal ictal discharges, irrespective of mossy fiber reorganization. Moreover, hippocampal neuronal damage that is acutely mimicked in our model by Schaffer collateral cut, may contribute to "short-circuit" propagation of activity by pathways that are masked when the hippocampus is intact.

The device consists of a transplantation cannula and microinjector system that has been specifically designed to reduce implantation-related trauma and to maximize the number of graft deposits per injection. The system was evaluated first in an experimental rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Animals in which transplantation with this system had been performed showed excellent graft survival with minimal trauma to the brain. Following this experimental stage, the cannula and microinjector system were used in eight patients with PD enrolled in the Halifax Neural Transplantation Program who received bilateral putaminal transplants of fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue. A total of 16 transplantation operations and 64 trajectories were performed in the eight patients, and there were no intraoperative or perioperative complications. Magnetic resonance imaging studies obtained 24 hours after surgery revealed no evidence of tissue damage or hemorrhage. Transplant survival was confirmed by fluorodopa positron emission tomography scans obtained 6 and 12 months after surgery. As neural transplantation procedures for the treatment of neurological conditions evolve, the ability to deliver viable grafts safely will become critically important. The device presented here has proved to be of value in maximizing the number of graft deposits while minimizing implantation-related trauma to the host brain.

Without an understanding of the factors that determine renewed drug-seeking, the urge to use drugs, and the persistent craving for them, it is unlikely that health care professionals can provide effective treatment, Using an animal model of relapse, the author and her team are studying factors that induce reinstatement of drug-taking behaviour after short and long periods of abstinence, and they are exploring the neurobiological basis of these effects. In their experiments, rats are trained to self-administer drugs intravenously by pressing 1 of 2 levers. During a subsequent period, the drug is no longer available, but the rats are free to try to obtain the drug (a period of "extinction training"). After extinction of responding, the investigators test for the ability of various events to reinitiate drug-seeking. On this background of renewed drug-seeking or relapse, the investigators search for pharmacological and neurochemical manipulations that might block or attenuate such behaviour. They have found that the 2 most effective events for reinstating responding after both short and long drug-free periods are re-exposure to the drug itself and exposure to a brief period of stress. The critical neurochemical pathways mediating drug-induced relapse are not identical to those mediating stress-induced relapse. Relapse induced by "priming" injections of heroin or cocaine involves activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways, whereas relapse induced by stress involves actions of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the brain, and of brain noradrenergic (NE) systems. In addition, evidence shows that CRF and NE may interact at the level of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in stress-induced relapse. By contrast, relapse induced by "priming" injections of drugs is relatively unaffected by manipulation of CRF and NE systems of the brain.

Typicality of atypical antipsychotics	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						antipsychotic agents; clozapine; cognition; receptors; dopamine; risperidone; schizophrenia	TREATMENT-RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA; D2-DOPAMINE RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY; DOUBLE-BLIND; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; ACOUSTIC STARTLE; DOPAMINE D-2; LONG-TERM; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROFILE; SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER; REFRACTORY SCHIZOPHRENIA	The typicality of atypical antipsychotic drugs remains debatable. Preclinical studies and findings from randomized, controlled and open trials of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, sertindole, ziprasidone and a substituted benzamide were examined. A MEDLINE search was conducted using key words, including "extrapyramidal side effects," "cognition," "schizophrenia" and the generic drug names. Over 140 articles from peer-reviewed journals were reviewed, some of which were based on a meta-analysis. New-generation neuroleptic agents were found to have greater efficacy on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and to cause fewer unwanted extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) than the traditional antipsychotic drugs. On one hand, atypical neuroleptic agents could be strictly defined as any neuroleptic agent with antipsychotic effects at a dosage that does not cause extrapyramidal side effects. Thus, clozapine is regarded as the "standard" atypical antipsychotic drug. On the other hand, typicality is about dimension rather than category, and we suggest the use of the term "spectrum of atypicality." For example, an emphasis is placed on quetiapine to illustrate where a new compound fits in this spectrum. Although dose-related, atypicality may be more a question of prescription attitude than of a specific characteristic of a compound. The degree to which a new compound is clinically superior to another atypical antipsychotic drug, in terms of improving positive, negative or affective symptoms, cognitive function and long-term outcome, will require further a priori hypotheses based on conceptual frameworks that are clinically meaningful. In addition, the results from industry-sponsored trials should be more comparable to those obtained from investigator-leading trials. Finally, the patient characteristics that define a patient's response to a specific antipsychotic drug are unknown.

To determine the prevalence and socioeconomic and clinical predictors of early organ damage in a cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) of 2-7 years' duration randomly sampled at 5 centers and balanced by socioeconomic status and race. Methods. The Systemic Lupus international Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) Damage Index was measured in 200 patients who met the ACR criteria for SLE with a mean disease duration of 3.8 years. The SLICC/ACR scores for each organ system and the prevalence of damage within organ systems were assessed. Logistic regression analyses evaluated the simultaneous effects of age at diagnosis, disease duration, disease activity, and sociodemographic factors. Results. Sixty-one percent of the patients had damage within 7 years of onset (mean 3.8 yrs). Neuropsychiatric (20.5%) and musculoskeletal (18.5%) systems were the most frequently involved, followed by renal (15.5%) and skin (12.5%) systems, all with median SLICC/ACR organ system scores of 1. In multivariate models, African-American race was associated with skin damage but nor with damage in other specific organ systems. Socioeconomic status was not associated with organ system damage. Older age at diagnosis correlated with cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, ocular, and pulmonary damage. Clinical factors such as longer disease duration correlated with higher renal and cardiovascular damage, and greater disease activity at diagnosis of SLE correlated with greater renal, musculoskeletal, and pulmonary damage. Conclusion. There is evidence of organ system damage in SLE within a mean of 3.8 years after onset. We found little evidence for differences in early organ damage according to race or socioeconomic status. Damage to most organ systems was related to age at diagnosis of SLE and clinical factors such as disease duration.

Materials and Methods: A total of 160 neurologically impaired patients were enrolled in the North American UroLume Multicenter Study Group for detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia application. Analysis was performed in 2 groups of patients in which the device was removed during insertion and after implantation, respectively. Results: Device retrieval was required during insertion in 21 patients (13%) mainly due to misplacement or migration in 17. Extraction was done with minimal complications and in all but 2 cases subsequent UroLume implantation was successful. Of 158 men with the device in place 31 (19.6%) required removal. In 34 procedures 44 devices were removed, mainly due to migration. Time from implantation to removal ranged from 4 days to 66 months (mean 22 months). The UroLume was removed en bloc in 20 cases and in parts or wire by wire in 19. The majority of patients had no or minimal complications after extraction. Only 2 patients had serious temporary complications, including bleeding and urethral injury, with no lasting consequences. No malignancy developed as a result of UroLume insertion. Conclusions: While there is a potential for urethral injury and bleeding, UroLume endoprosthesis removal is largely a simple procedure with minimal complications and consequences.

Neuropathologic evaluation reveals significant cerebral cortical atrophy, delayed myelination and Alzheimer type II astrocytosis. Using an animal model of congenital OTC deficiency, the sparse fur (spf) mouse, studies reveal convincing evidence of a loss of forebrain cholinergic neurons in this condition. Evidence includes (i) reduced activities of the cholinergic nerve terminal enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), (ii) a 25% loss of ChAT immunostaining, (iii) reduced high affinity transport of [H-3]choline by cortical synaptosomes and (iv) a selective reduction in densities of presynaptic muscarinic M-2 binding sites, in spf mouse brain compared to controls. A partial correction of the cholinergic deficit was observed following treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine, Possible mechanisms responsible for cholinergic neuronal loss in congenital OTC deficiency include decreased synthesis of the ChAT substrate acetyl CoA, impaired cerebral energy metabolism and NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Loss of forebrain cholinergic neurons is consistent with the severe cognitive impairment characteristic of congenital OTC deficiency.

In neuroendocrine cells, the dopamine D2 receptor short form (D2S receptor) inhibits cell proliferation, whereas in mesenchymal cells the same receptor enhances cell proliferation. Nontransformed BALB/c 3T3 fibroblast cells were stably transfected with the D2S receptor cDNA to study the G proteins that direct D2S signaling to stimulate cell proliferation. Pertussis toxin inactivates G(i) and G(o) proteins and blocks signaling of the D2S receptor in these cells. D2S receptor signaling was reconstituted by individually transfecting pertussis toxin-resistant G alpha(i/o) subunit mutants and measuring D2-induced responses in pertussis toxin-treated cells. This approach identified G alpha(i)2 and G alpha(i)3 as mediators of the D2S receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity; G alpha(i)2-mediated D2S-induced stimulation of p42 and p44 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) and DNA synthesis, whereas G alpha(i)3 was required for formation of transformed foci, Transfection of toxin-resistant G alpha(i)1 cDNA induced abnormal cell growth independent of D2S receptor activation, while G alpha(o) inhibited dopamine-induced transformation. The role of G beta gamma subunits was assessed by ectopic expression of the carboxyl-terminal domain of G protein receptor kinase to selectively antagonize G beta gamma activity. Mobilization of G beta gamma subunits was required for D2S-induced calcium mobilization, MAPK activation, and DNA synthesis, These findings reveal a remarkable and distinct G protein specificity for D2S receptor-mediated signaling to initiate DNA synthesis (G alpha(i)2 and G beta gamma) and oncogenic transformation (G alpha(i)3), and they indicate that acute activation of MAPK correlates with enhanced DNA synthesis but not with transformation.

We have investigated the role of the calcium-dependent adhesion molecules, the cadherins, in oligodendrocyte-astrocyte interaction and oligodendrocyte progenitor migration. Immunostaining demonstrated the expression of N-cadherin on the surfaces of both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte-like cells adhered to and spread on N-cadherin substrates. The blocking of cadherin function by antisera or specific peptides reduced adhesion of oligodendroglia to astrocyte monolayers, diminished contact time between oligodendrocyte processes and individual astrocytes, and significantly increased the migration of oligodendrocyte-like cells on astrocyte monolayers. Furthermore, a soluble cadherin molecule without adhesive properties increased oligodendroglial proliferation on various extracellular matrix substrates. These data suggest that cadherins are at least partially responsible for the poor migration-promoting properties of astrocytes and that decreasing cell-cell adhesion might effect repopulation of demyelinated multiple sclerosis lesions by oligodendrocyte progenitors.

The majority of untreated patients experience irreversible impairment of cognitive development. Although it is one of the best known hereditary metabolic disorders, mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of the disease are still not fully understood; to this end, the availability of an orthologous animal model is relevant. Various mutant hyperphenylalaninemic mouse models with an HPA phenotype, generated by N-ethyl-N'-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis at the Pah locus, have become available. Here we report a new hybrid strain, ENU1/2, with primary enzyme deficiency, produced by cross breeding. The ENU1, ENU1/2, and ENU2 strains display mild, moderate, and severe phenotypes, respectively, relative to the control strain (BTBR/Pas), The Pah enzyme activities of the various models correlate inversely with the corresponding phenylalanine levels in plasma and brain and the delay in plasma clearance response following a phenylalanine challenge, The maternal HPA effect on the fetus correlates directly with the degree of hyperphenylalaninemia, but only the ENU2 strain has impaired learning.

Several clinical reports indicated that many patients with RLS also have arm paresthesia and restlessness. In the present study, the incidence of arm restlessness was assessed by questionnaire in 230 patients diagnosed with idiopathic RLS. Arm restlessness was reported by 48.7% of the patients. Patients with and without arm restlessness were compared with regard to clinical and polysomnographic parameters. No between-group differences were found for age at onset of RLS, duration of illness, gender, presence of a family history of RLS, sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and pe riodic leg movements index during sleep. However, arm restlessness was more frequent in patients with severe RLS. Interestingly, the polysomnographic data failed to differentiate the patients with arm restlessness from those without arm restlessness, except for sleep efficiency, which tended to be lower in patients with arm restlessness. In conclusion, the results of the present study are in agreement with clinical observations that a large proportion of patients with RLS have arm restlessness.

To establish the cause of our recent finding of reduced brain levels of phospholipids in FA, we assayed activities of 10 phospholipid-metabolizing: enzymes in the autopsied cerebellar cortex of patients with the disorder and, for comparison, in a group of patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA-I), a disease characterized, unlike FA, by marked neuronal loss in the cerebellar cortex. Enzyme activities were also measured in four brain areas which are relatively unaffected morphologically in both FA and SCA-1. We found that ethanolamine kinase activity was increased in multiple brain regions of patients with FA (increased 31%-137%) and, more modestly, in SCA-I (increased 39%-60%), suggesting a nonspecific enhancement of phosphoethanolamine production in both disorders. In contrast, the activity of phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (PECT), the rate-limiting enzyme of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis, was significantly and markedly decreased by 35%-78% in the cerebellar, frontal, and occipital cortices of patients with FA but was normal in SCA-1. Reduced PECT activity in FA may explain the lower brain levels of phosphatidylethanolamine in the disorder. Moreover, because decreased PECT activity in FA occurs in brain regions having no, or only modest, morphologic damage, this may represent a systemic change consequent to the frataxin gene defect. Our data also suggest: that therapeutic intervention in FA designed to increase synthesis of membrane phospholipids may warrant further investigation.

A 66-year-old man suffered a comminuted fracture of the proximal humerus after a fall. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed a severe proximal median neuropathy and a mild distal radial mononeuropathy. Proximal median neuropathy rarely occurs in humeral neck fracture, mostly because the median nerve is not in close contact with the humerus proximally. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Previous work has shown that sleep deprivation of any type can exacerbate seizure activity, leading to speculation that the intrinsically poor sleep in these patients may serve as a threshold-lowering factor, and that this factor might be partially reversed by effective antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). However, to better understand this interaction, it is necessary to know whether the sleep disorder of epilepsy is caused by repetitive ictal events or whether it is part of a process that causes epilepsy to emerge in the first place. In addition, to separate and analyze the sleep effects of AEDs, one must compare studies of normal controls, which have only rarely been accomplished, with studies of drug-free patients, which are difficult to achieve. As little as is known about the detailed effects of AEDs on sleep architecture, et en less is known about the mechanisms by which AEDs might cause such effects. Nevertheless, there is great potential for those undertaking such work, due to the wealth of basic science accumulating in the field of sleep mechanisms and the prodigious amount of information already amassed in the area of anticonvulsant mechanisms.

As adults, handled animals showed reduced startle responsivity, increased exploration in a novel open field, and decreased novelty-induced suppression of feeding relative to the handled (H) and/or maternal separation (MS) groups. As compared with handled animals, both nonhandled (NH) and MS animals displayed: (1) reduced GABA(A) receptor levels in the locus coeruleus (LC) and the n. tractus solitarius (NTS); (2) reduced CBZ receptor sites in the central and lateral n. of the amygdala, the frontal cortex, and in the LC and NTS; and (3) reduced levels of the mRNA for the gamma 2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor complex, which confers high affinity BZ binding, in the amygdaloid nucleic as well as the he LC and NTS. Both the amygdala and the ascending nonadrenergic systems have been considered as critical sites for the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines. These data suggest that early life events influence the development of the GABA(A) receptor system, thus altering the expression of fearfulness in adulthood.

Studies with animals have shown that in utero exposure to cocaine interferes with fetal brain development by disrupting the processes of neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and migration, often leading to subsequent neurobehavioral deficits. However, studies with humans have produced inconsistent findings. Although neurobehavioral abnormalities have been observed among cocaine-exposed infants in several studies and in some cases dose-response effects have been found, the specific neurobehaviors affected vary from one study to the next. Researchers studying the effects of fetal cocaine-exposure are faced with many difficult challenges. For example, women who use cocaine typically use other substances in addition to cocaine, many of the methods available for identifying cocaine-exposed neonates are not reliable, and the available methods for assessing cocaine-exposed newborns may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect the subtle effects of cocaine on the developing central nervous system. Despite these difficulties, there is a growing body of research that suggests that fetal cocaine exposure is associated with subsequent language deficits among children exposed in utero. However, it is virtually impossible to disentangle the effects of the impoverished environments in which these children are often raised from the effect, if any, of fetal cocaine exposure. To determine the effects of fetal cocaine exposure independent of postnatal environmental effects, cocaine-exposed neonates would ideally be tested within the first few weeks of birth, and to identify early risks for subsequent language delay, well-researched auditory information processing measures could be used. Objective. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of fetal cocaine exposure on neonatal auditory information processing ability. To overcome limitations of some previous studies on the neuroteratogenic effects of cocaine, such as unreliable subject identification techniques, inadequate control over confounding variables, and questionable measures of central nervous system integrity, a valid measure of auditory information processing was used in a rigorous, case-control design. Method. Newborn information processing was assessed using habituation and recovery of head-turning toward an auditory stimulus across the 3 phases of the procedure: familiarization, novelty, and dishabituation. During the familiarization phase, the infant orients and habituates to a repeated word; during the novelty phase, the infant recovers head-turning to a novel word and subsequently habituates to this word; and during the dishabituation phase the infant displays renewed head-turning to the return of the original stimulus. Testing takes similar to 20 minutes. This procedure has been shown previously to discriminate among infants at high-, moderate-, and low-risk for subsequent developmental delay. Twenty-five cocaine-exposed and 25 nonexposed control neonates, identified by meconium analysis, urine analysis, and/or maternal self-report, were tested on the auditory information processing procedure. The majority of infants were tested within the first few days of birth. Cocaine-exposed and control neonates were matched on birth weight, gestational age, Apgar scores, age at testing, and socioeconomic status as reflected by household income. Mothers were matched on age, weight gain, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. Results. Fetal cocaine exposure was associated with impaired auditory information processing. Both cocaine-exposed and nonexposed control neonates oriented to the familiarization stimulus, but cocaine-exposed neonates displayed impaired habituation. Moreover, cocaine-exposed neonates did not recover or habituate to the novel stimulus or dishabituate to the return of the familiarization stimulus. Whereas nonexposed, control infants exhibited high levels of turning away from the familiarization stimulus during habituation (implying boredom), followed by high levels of turning toward the novel stimulus, indicating recovery of attention, the cocaine-exposed infants turned randomly. Clearly, auditory information processing of cocaine-exposed infants was impaired, despite the fact that they exhibited the same overall number of head-turns and the same high level of positive state as the nonexposed infants. Conclusions. The results imply that cocaine is a neuroteratogenic agent that impairs auditory information processing ability during the newborn period. Cocaine-exposed neonates exhibited a response pattern that is consistent with slower speed of auditory information processing. These deficits were observed within the first few days of birth, before adverse postnatal environmental influences could exert their effect. Moreover, the case-control design increased the probability that the observed information processing deficits were due primarily to the direct effects of fetal exposure to cocaine and not other prenatal factors. However, the long-term implications of these findings for the development of the infant/child are not known and must be addressed in follow-up studies.

As a model to study regulation of convertases in embryo, we use the P19 embryonal carcinoma cell line, which can differentiate into various cell types. The expression of convertase PC2 and its specific binding peptide 7B2 are co-induced during neuronal differentiation of P19 cells. We investigated the possibility that expression of both proteins may be coregulated by T3 and dexamethasone, activators of nuclear receptors, isobutylmethylxanthine, and dibutyryl cAMP, activators of protein kinase A, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C. Western blotting results show that expression of PC2 and 7B2 can be upregulated by modulators of the protein kinases, and upregulation needs not be strictly stoichiometric.

Activation of CGRP receptors (subtypes 1 or 2) usually induces vasodilation and/or muscle relaxation, but its effects in dog and on gastroduodenal motility are still unclear. This study looked for the effect of CGRP and the antagonist CGRP8-37, specific for CGRP type 1 receptor, 1) on GT motility (interdigestive and postprandial), and 2) on hemodynamy, in conscious dogs. During the interdigestive period, the infusion of CGRP1-37 (200 pmol/kg/h) or CGRP8-37 (2000 pmol/kg/h) did not modify the duration of the migrating motor complex nor the release nor the motor action of plasma motilin. The gastric emptying of a solid meal (15 g meat/kg) was reduced by the administration of CGRP1-37 (AUC: 2196 +/- 288.6 versus 3618 +/- 288.4 with saline or T1/2: 78 +/- 7.3 versus 50 +/- 4.3 min; P < 0.01) and this effect was reversed by the antagonist CGRP8-37. CGRP1-37 significantly (P ( 0.01) diminished arterial pressures (118 +/- 1.6/64 +/- 1.4 vs. 125 +/- 1.4/75 +/- 1.2 mmHg with saline) and accelerated the basal cardiac rhythm (110 +/- 1.4 versus 83 +/- 1.6 beats/min). However, CGRP8-37 failed to block the cardiovascular effects of CGRP1-37. In dog, CGRP could influence digestive motility by slowing the gastric emptying of a meal through an action on CGRP-I receptors. Hemodynamic effects of CGRP were not blocked by CGRP8-37 and seem therefore mediated by CGRP-2 receptor subtype. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Herein we describe a rapid method for isolating relatively large amounts of MBP from bovine brain with a purity greater than that currently available from commercial sources. Lipids were first extracted from the CNS tissue by homogenization in sec-butanol. Washes under neutral and mildly basic conditions were employed to remove neutral and acidic proteins from the defatted residue. MBP was subsequently extracted under acidic conditions and further purified by chromatography on CM Sephadex C-25. Potential contaminating enzyme activities were destroyed by heart treatment. This method typically yields a recovery of 1.0-1.5 mg MBP per gram of starting material with a purity of greater than 95%. The MBP prepared in this manner was suitable for determination of kinase activities by both solution and the "in gel" kinase assay systems. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

A comparative study on the position of pediclescrews in patients treated surgically with and without computer assistance. Objectives, To evaluate the accuracy of computer-assisted pedicle screw installation, and to evaluate its clinical benefit as compared with conventional pedicle screw installation techniques. Summary of Background Data. In vitro and clinical studies have documented a significant rate of misplaced screws in the thoracolumbar area, Neurologic complications are recognized problems caused by screw misplacement. Methods. Patients treated surgically with computer assistance were compared with a historical control group of patients treated surgically with conventional techniques in the same hospital and by the same surgical team. All screw positions were measured with a postoperative magnetic resonance tomography, and cortical effractions were categorized in 2-mm increments. Patients' charts also were reviewed to assess individual neurologic outcomes. Results. The control cohort was composed of 100 patients, with 544 screws from T5 to S1. The computer assisted cohort was composed of 50 patients, with 294 screws from T2 to S1. In the control cohort, 461 of 544 screws (85%) were found completely within their pedicles as compared with 278 of 294 screws (95%) correctly placed in the computer-assisted group (P< 0.0001). All 16 screws incorrectly placed with computer assistance were found 0.1 mm to 2 mm from the pedicle cortex. In the control cohort, 68 screws were found 0.1 mm to 2 mm, 10 screws 2.1 mm to 4 mm, and 5 screws more than 4 mm from the pedicle cortex. Seven patients in the control cohort were surgically retreated because of postoperative neurologic deficits, whereas no patients in the computer assisted group were surgically retreated. Conclusions. Computer assistance can decrease the incidence of incorrectly positioned pedicle screws.

Stroke is no exception. Methods-Detailed information on healthcare use was collected in conjunction with two 12-week international trials designed primarily to assess the safety and efficacy of a new potential neuroprotective agent. The information was gathered prospectively by means of a customized resource use instrument that included both acute and long-term inpatient management as well as community care. In this report, the results pertaining to the 1341 acute ischemic stroke patients are described. Results-More than 70% of the mean cost ($13 668) was explained by the initial hospitalization, which averaged 24 days. The total cost and its components varied according to patient age, the presence of comorbidities, and several indicators of disease severity. Pronounced country differences could be observed in the management of this fairly homogeneous patient group. Conclusions-This study provides a comprehensive picture of the healthcare services used for the treatment and rehabilitation of stroke victims, presented with respect to various patient and disease characteristics. It is expected that researchers evaluating the cost-efficiency of specific stroke treatments will benefit from the detailed information presented in this report.

Neurotrophins and their receptors are important targets for the therapy of human disease, with potential applications ranging from the treatment of chronic or acute neurodegeneration to pain and cancer. Neurotrophins have been used clinically but are poor pharmacological agents. Consequently, approaches to develop pharmacological agents th at target neurotrophins, their receptors or neurotrophin signaling pathways have been attempted.

The anticholinesterase eserine provoked interictal-like discharges in the CA3 area of PTZ-injected rats (19/33), but not in controls (0/15), an effect mimicked by carbachol and reversed by atropine. This enhanced response to eserine Was recorded in slices from 25-100% of the PTZ-injected rats, the percentage varying with the age at injection and post-injection interval. These results suggest that seizures in immature brain may have long-term consequences in cholinergic neurotransmission, converting a rise in endogenous ACh into an epileptogenic stimulus, which in turn would presumably facilitate the recurrence of seizures.

Here, we examined the scalp distribution of components NI and P3 of auditory evoked potentials during a sound localization task in four totally blind subjects who had previously shown better performance than sighted subjects. Both NI and P3 waves peaked at their usual positions while blind acid sighted individuals performed the task. However, in blind subjects these two components were also found to be robust over occipital regions while in sighted individuals this pattern was not seen. We conclude that deafferented posterior visual areas in blind individuals are recruited to carry:out auditory functions, enabling these individuals to compensate for their lack of vision.

Heterologous expression of HERG1 gives rise to K+ currents that are similar (but not identical) to the rapid component of delayed rectification, I-Kr in cardiac myocytes, In addition, N-terminal splice variants of HERG1 and MERG1 (mouse ERG1) referred to as HERG1b and NIERG1b have been cloned and suggested to play roles in the generation of functional I-Kr channels. In the experiments here, antibodies generated against HERG1 were used to examine ERG1 protein expression in heart and in brain. In Western blots of extracts of QT-6 cells expressing HERG1, MERG1, dr RERG1 (rat ERG1) probed with antibodies targeted against the C terminus of HERG1, a single 155-kDa protein is identified, whereas a 95-kDa band is evident in blots of extracts from cells expressing MERG1b or HEBG1b. In immunoblots of fractionated rat (and mouse) brain and heart membrane proteins, however, two prominent high molecular mass proteins of 165 and 205 kDa were detected. Following treatment with glycopeptidase F, the 165- and 205-kDa proteins were replaced by two new bands at 175 and 130 kDa, suggesting that ERG1 is differentially glycosylated in rat/mouse brain and heart. In human heart, a single HERG1 protein with an apparent molecular mass of 145 kDa is evident. In rats, ERG1 protein (and I-Kr) expression is higher in atria than ventricles, whereas in humans, HERG1 expression is higher in ventricular, than atrial, tissue. Taken together, these results suggest that the N-terminal alternatively spliced variants of ERG1 (i.e. ERG1b) are not expressed at the protein level in rat, mouse, or human heart and that these variants do not, therefore, play roles in the generation of functional cardiac I-Kr channels.

Wild type (+/+) and Lc/+ mice were treated for 40 days with L-tryptophan or buspirone, and serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and their main metabolites were measured in the cerebellum. In +/+ mice, only buspirone increased concentrations of 5-HT metabolites. In the hypoplastic Lc/+ cerebellum, indoleamines were higher, and increased further after both treatments. The 5-HT turnover index was increased in +/+ mice by buspirone, while in Lc/+ mutants it increased after L-tryptophan but was decreased by buspirone, indicating that in the mutants nerve terminals synthesize and accumulate 5-HT, but may not utilize it efficiently. Catecholamine contents remained unchanged in +/+ mice, but in Lc/+ mutants with higher endogenous NA, L-tryptophan further increased NA and 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and buspirone augmented NA, DA and DOPAC levels.

This novel cyclic hexapeptide did not bind the SRIF receptor. Thus, a single mutation converted L-363,301, a SRIF agonist with potency ca. 2-8 times the potency of SRIF in laboratory animals,(24) into a selective NK-1 receptor antagonist with an IC50 of 2 nM in vitro. During the screening of the same libraries for ligands of the delta-opioid receptor, we identified four compounds (1-4) which represent a new class of d-opioid antagonists, some of which were also NK-1 receptor antagonists. The most potent delta-opioid antagonist, c[-Pro-1-Nal-D-Trp-Tyr-Thr-Phe-] (2), showed a K-e value of 128 nM in the mouse vas deferens assay and a delta-receptor binding affinity constant of 152 nM in the rat brain membrane binding assay. These results are of interest because they represent a novel class of delta-opioid antagonists and, like two previously reported delta-opioid antagonists, they lack a positive charge. To examine further the requirement for a positive charge in the delta-opioid ligands, we prepared two analogues of the beta-casomorphin-derived mixed mu-agonist/delta-antagonist, H-Dmt-c[-D-Orn-2-Nal-D-Pro-Gly-] (7), in which we eliminated the positive charge either through formylation of the primary amino group (5) or by the deletion of this N-terminal amino group (6). These latter compounds proved to be delta-opioid antagonists with K-e values in the 16-120 nM range, as well as fairly potent mu-opioid antagonists (K-e approximate to 200 nM). These six compounds provide the most convincing evidence to date that there is no requirement for a positive charge in mu- and delta-opioid receptor antagonists. In addition, cyclic hexapeptide 4 lacks a phenolic hydroxyl group. Taken together, these data suggest that the prevailing assumptions about delta- and mu-opioid receptor binding need revision and that the receptors for these opioid ligands have much in common with the NK-I and somatostatin receptors.

Reaction product was found in restricted populations of neurons and astrocyte-like cells. Neurons immunoreactive for ER-alpha were diffusely distributed within the basal forebrain and preoptic area, infundibular region, central hypothalamus. basal ganglia and amygdala. Immunoreactive astrocyte-like cells were noted within specific brain regions, including the lamina terminalis and subependymal peri-third-ventricular region. These data are consistent with the location of estrogen receptors in the basal forebrain of other species and the known effects of estrogens on the cellular functions of both neurons and supporting elements within the human hypothalamus and basal forebrain.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a mouse homologue of extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)3. The mouse Erk3 cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 720 residues, which displays 94% identity with human ERK3. Transcription and translation of this cDNA in vitro generates a 100 kDa protein similar to the human gene product ERK3. Immunoblot analysis with an antibody raised against a unique sequence of ERK3 also recognizes a 100 kDa protein in mouse tissues. A single transcript of Erk3 was detected in every adult mouse tissue examined, with the highest expression being found in the brain. Interestingly, expression of Erk3 mRNA is acutely regulated during mouse development, with a peak of expression observed at embryonic day 11. The mouse Erk3 gene was mapped to a single locus on central mouse chromosome 9, adjacent to the dilute mutation locus and in a region syntenic to human chromosome 15q21, Finally, we provide several lines of evidence to support the existence of a unique Erk3 gene product of inn kDa in mammalian cells.

In this review, we consider properties of resident cells of the CNS, that participate in regulating the neural antigen (Ag)-directed immune responses implicated in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Under such conditions, the CNS is usually viewed as the target or victim of the immune assault, because such immune responses are thought to be initiated and regulated within the systemic immune compartment, The CNS-endogenous cells may themselves, however, initiate, regulate and sustain an immune response. We consider the immune regulatory functions within the CNS in terms of events occurring within the CNS parenchyma (microglia, astroglia) and at the vascular interface. These regulatory functions involve antigen presentation to T cells and polarization of the cytokine response of these cells. Such responses may contribute not only to the overall tissue injury in primary immune disorders but also in a wide range of traumatic, ischemic and degenerative processes. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, the discharge properties of cholinergic cells in relation to the electroencephalogram (EEG) are not yet known. In the present study, cells were recorded in the basal forebrain in association with cortical EEG activity in urethane-anesthetized rats, and their discharge was examined during EEG irregular slow activity and during stimulation-induced cortical activation, characterized by rhythmic slow (theta) and high-frequency (gamma) activities. Recorded cells were labeled with Neurobiotin (Nb), using the juxtacellular technique and identified as cholinergic by immunohistochemical staining for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Nb-positive/ChAT-positive neurons were distinctive and significantly different from Nb-positive/ChAT-negative neurons, which were heterogeneous in their discharge properties. All Nb1/ChAT1 cells increased their discharge rate with stimulation, and most shifted from an irregular tonic discharge during EEG slow irregular activity to a rhythmic burst discharge during rhythmic slow activity. The stimulation-induced rhythmic discharge was cross-correlated with the EEG rhythmic slow activity. In some units the rhythmic discharge matched the rhythmic slow activity of the retrosplenial cortex; in others, it matched that of the prefrontal cortex, which occurred at a slower frequency, suggesting that subsets of cholinergic neurons may influence their cortical target areas rhythmically at particular frequencies. Cholinergic basal forebrain neurons thus may evoke and enhance cortical activation via both an increase in rate and a change in pattern to rhythmic bursting that would stimulate rhythmic slow (theta-like) activity in cortical fields during active waking and paradoxical sleep states.

During perfusion of artificial extracellular fluid into the VTA, injections of 0.74 mg of the excitatory amino acid NMDA into the VS elevated accumbens DA to >150% of basal values. During intra-VTA perfusion of either 1 mu M tetrodotoxin (which blocks impulse flow) or 1 mM kynurenic acid (which blocks excitatory glutamate receptors), injections of NMDA into the VS failed to elevate accumbens DA. Thus, increased impulse flow through VTA DA neurons, mediated by excitatory glutamate inputs to this region, appears critical for VS stimulation to elevate NAS DA. Increased impulse flow through VTA DA neurons was confirmed using single-unit recording in anesthetized rats. Intra-VS NMDA injections increased the firing rates of 45% (14 of 31), decreased the firing rates of 13% (4 of 31), and had no effect on 42% (13 of 31) of VTA DA neurons. Increases in firing rates were evident within 15 min of NMDA injections, a time at which VS NMDA injections elevate accumbens DA in awake animals. The results of the present experiments identify the VTA as a critical site through which outputs from the VS modulate NAS dopaminergic neurotransmission.

Previous results have demonstrated that the procerebral cell population is morphologically heterogeneous. In the present study, serial sections and electron microscopy were used to investigate differences in synapse distributions. The results demonstrate that procerebral neurons with different sites of arborization have distinct patterns of synapse distribution that probably reflect different functional contributions to the olfactory pathway. Cells that have all their arborizations in the procerebrum, but none in the internal mass, have multiple large varicosities that are specialized for output. On the other hand cells that arborize in the internal mass or outside the procerebrum have mostly input synapses proximal to the soma and mostly output synapses in the terminal region of the neurites. These cells appear to transmit information from the procerebral cell body mass to other central nervous system regions, e.g., the internal mass and the mesocerebrum. The implications of these data are twofold. Firstly, the procerebrum directly participates in distributing processed olfactory information to more central regions of the nervous system. Secondly, the procerebral neuronal population may be divisible into two subgroups: 1) intrinsically arborizing interneurons; and 2) projection neurons. This is significant because the neural organization of the procerebrum may now be compared with that of olfactory systems in other organisms. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The classical cadherins contain an evolutionarily conserved His-Ala-Val (HAV) sequence, and linear peptides harboring this motif are capable of inhibiting a variety of cadherin-dependent processes. We now demonstrate that short cyclic HAV peptides can inhibit N-cadherin function. Interestingly, the nature of the amino acids that flank the HAV motif determine both the activity and specificity of the peptides. For example, when the HAV motif is flanked by a single aspartic acid, which mimics the natural HAVD sequence of N-cadherin, the peptide becomes a much more effective inhibitor of N-cadherin function. In contrast, when the HAV motif is flanked by a single serine, which mimics the natural HAVS sequence of E-cadherin, it loses its ability to inhibit the N-cadherin response. Our results demonstrate that subtle changes in the amino acids that flank the HAV motif can account for cadherin specificity and that small cyclic peptides can inhibit cadherin function. An emerging role for cadherins in a number of pathological processes suggests that the cyclic peptides reported in this study might be developed as therapeutic agents.

J	Patel, BN; Dunn, RJ; David, S				Patel, BN; Dunn, RJ; David, S			Alternative RNA splicing generates a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored form of ceruloplasmin in mammalian brain	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IRON UPTAKE; GENE-EXPRESSION; PLASMA-PROTEINS; ACERULOPLASMINEMIA; CELLS; PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL; METABOLISM; RETINA; ORIGIN	Ceruloplasmin is a copper containing ferroxidase that is essential for normal iron homeostasis. Whereas ceruloplasmin in plasma is produced and secreted by hepatocytes, in the brain a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is expressed on the surface of astrocytes, By using a cDNA cloning approach, we have now determined that the GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is generated by alternative RNA splicing. The splicing occurs downstream of exon 18 and replaces the C-terminal 5 amino acids of the secreted form with an alternative 30 amino acids that signal GPI anchor addition. RNase protection analysis demonstrates that the GPI-anchored form is the major form in the brain, whereas the secreted form predominates in the liver. Individuals with aceruloplasminemia, a hereditary deficiency of ceruloplasmin, have severe iron deposition in a number of organs, including the brain where it results-in neurodegeneration. Therefore, this novel GPI-anchored form of ceruloplasmin is likely to play an important role in iron metabolism in the central nervous system.

To determine the precise localization of these receptors, we examined their respective cellular and subcellular distributions in the nucleus raphe dorsalis and hippocampal formation (5-HT1A) and in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra (5-HT1B), using light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with specific antibodies. Both immunogold and immunoperoxidase preembedding labelings were achieved. In the nucleus raphe dorsalis, 5-HT1A immunoreactivity was found exclusively on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites, and mostly along extrasynaptic portions of their plasma membrane. After immunogold labeling, the density of membrane-associated 5-HT1A receptors could be estimated to be at least 30-40 times that in the cytoplasm. In the hippocampal formation, the somata as well as dendrites of pyramidal and granule cells displayed 5-HT1A immunoreactivity, which was also prominent on the dendritic spines of pyramidal cells. In both substantia nigra and globus pallidus, 5-HT1B receptors were preferentially associated with the membrane of fine, unmyelinated, preterminal axons, and were not found on axon terminals. A selective localization to the cytoplasm of endothelial cells of microvessels was also observed. Because the 5-HT1A receptors are somatodendritic, they are ideally situated to mediate serotonin effects on neuronal firing, both as auto- and as heteroreceptors. The localization of 5-HT1B receptors to the membrane of preterminal axons suggests that they control transmitter release from nonserotonin as well as serotonin neurons by mediating serotonin effects on axonal conduction. The fact that these two receptor subtypes predominate at extrasynaptic and nonsynaptic sites provides further evidence for diffuse serotonin transmission in the CNS. J. Comp.

The majority of patients are heteroplasmic for a mutation (A3243G) in the tRNA(leu(UUR)) gene in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In cells cultured in vitro, the mutation produces a severe mitochondrial translation defect only when the proportion of mutant mtDNAs exceeds 95% of total mtDNAs, However, most patients are symptomatic well below this threshold, a paradox that remains unexplained. We studied the relationship between the level of heteroplasmy for the mutant mtDNA and the clinical and biochemical abnormalities in a large pedigree that included 8 individuals carrying the A3243G mutation, 4 of whom were asymptomatic. Unexpectedly, we found that brain lactate, a sensitive indicator of oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction, was linearly related to the proportion of mutant mtDNAs in all individuals carrying the mutation, whether they were symptomatic or not. There was no evidence for threshold expression of the metabolic defect. These results suggest that marked tissue-specific differences may exist in the pathogenic expression of the A3243G mutation and explain why a neurological phenotype can be observed at relatively low levels of heteroplasmy.

We studied 21 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy and bilateral hippocampal atrophy defined by magnetic resonance imaging volumetric measurements who underwent surgical treatment. H-1-MRSI was used to determine the relative resonance intensity ratio of the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate to creatine + phosphocreatine (NAA/Cr) for mid and posterior temporal lobe regions of the left and right hemisphere, as well as an asymmetry index. Values lower than 2 SDs bellow the normal mean were considered abnormal. We used Engel's classification to assess surgical outcome with respect to seizure control. Eleven patients (52%) were in class I-II and 10 (48%) were in class III-TV. All 21 were operated on the side of maximal electroencephalographic (EEG) lateralization. Concordant lateralization of decreases in NAA/Cr to the side of surgery and normal NAA/Cr values in the contralateral posterior-temporal region were significantly associated with good surgical outcome: 11 (69%) of 16 patients with H-1-MRSI abnormalities concordant with EEG lateralization and none of the 5 patients with nonconcordant H-1-MRSI had a good outcome (class I-II); 10 (77%) of 13 patients with normal NAA/Cr contralateral to the EEG lateralization versus 1 (12.5%) of 8 of those with NAA/Cr reduction contralateral to EEG lateralization were in class I-II. Regression correlation analysis showed significant linear correlation between the midtemporal NAA/Cr relative asymmetry ratio and surgical outcome; the greater the asymmetry, the better the outcome. We conclude that discriminant H-1-MRSI features associated with favorable surgical outcome in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and bilateral hippocampal atrophy were (1) concordant H-1-MRSI lateralization, (2) a greater side-to-side asymmetry off NAA/Cr, and (3) an absence of contralateral posterior NAA/Cr reduction.

In a preliminary study, 5 mg of ENU was shown to induce 30 to 40% neurogenic tumors in F344 rats offspring after 420 days of observation. In the present study, 400 female rats were divided into eight different groups (50 animals/group) and exposed in utero ton day 18 of gestation) to a single intravenous dose of either Saline (Group I), or ENU, 5 mg/kg (Group II to VIII). Dams in group II were given no further treatment while dams in Groups III to VII were exposed to 5 different intensities of MFs forty eight hours later. Animals in group III were sham exposed (< 0.02 mu T) while groups IV to VII were exposed to 2, 20, 200 and 2000 mu T, respectively. Dams in Group VIII were injected intraperitoneally with 12-O-tetradecanoylphrobol-13-acetate (TPA; 10 mu g/kg) from day 19 until delivery, and then their female offspring continued to be injected every 15 days, starting at day 14 after birth until sacrifice (positive controls). Accordingly, this study included three different types of controls: Internal controls (Groups II and III and positive control (Group VIII). Body weight, mortality and clinical observations were evaluated in all groups of animals during in-life exposure. Necropsy was performed on all exposed and central animals that died, were found moribund or sacrificed at termination of the study. Histopathological evaluation was done for all brains, spinal cords, cranial nerves, major organs (lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, pituitary, thyroid and adrenals) and all gross lesions observed during necropsy. All clinical observations and pathological evaluations were conducted under "blinded" conditions. The findings from this ENU/MFs promotion study clearly demonstrate that, under our defined experimental conditions, exposure to 60 Hz linear (single axis) sinusoidal, continuous wave MFs had no effect on the survival of female F344 rats or on the number of animals bearing neurogenic tumors. These results suggest that MFs have no promoting effect on neurogenic tumors in the female F344 rats exposed transplacentally to ENU. (C) 2000,Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Further, we investigated which sumatriptan-sensitive receptors are present in human coronary artery by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 2 Agonists with affinity at the 5-HT1B receptor, such as sumatriptan, alniditan and/or IS-159, elicited dose-dependent contraction in both human and bovine cerebral arteries. They behaved as full agonists at the sumatriptan-sensitive 5-HT1 receptors in both species. In contrast, PNU-109291 and LY344864, selective agonists at 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors, respectively, were devoid of any significant vasocontractile activity in cerebral arteries, or did not affect the sumatriptan-induced vasocontraction. The rank order of agonist potency was similar in both species and could be summarized as 5-HT = alniditan > sumatriptan = IS-159 > > > PNU-109291 = LY344864. 3 In bovine cerebral arteries, the 5-HT1 receptor antagonist GR127935 dose-dependently inhibited the vasoconstrictions elicited by both 5-HT and sumatriptan, with respective pA(2) values of 8.0 and 8.6. 4 RT-PCR studies in human coronary arteries showed a strong signal for the 5-HT1B receptor while message for the 5-HT1F receptor was weak and less frequently detected. Expression of 5-HT1D receptor mRNA was not detected in any sample. 5 The present results demonstrate that the triptan-induced contraction in brain vessels is mediated exclusively by the 5-HT1B receptor, which is also present in a majority of human coronary arteries. These results suggest that selective 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptor agonists might represent new antimigraine drugs devoid of cerebro- and cardiovascular effects.

The models computed present two important characteristics: an average intensity and an average shape, both in a single image. We provide results showing convergence toward the centroid of the image set used for the computation of the model. In particular, the RMS distances between the model and the MR images contained in the set stabilize in a range of 2.88 to 3.36 mm from a range of 4.62 to 5.51 mm initially after only one iteration. As for the influence of the reference image chosen for the model construction, this is minimal with differences of about 1.0 mm, from approximately 3.5 mm initially. These results ensure the usefulness of our approach. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

J	Noubani, A; Farookhi, R; Gutkowska, J				Noubani, A; Farookhi, R; Gutkowska, J			B-type natriuretic peptide receptor expression and activity are hormonally regulated in rat ovarian cells	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							FOLLICLE-STIMULATING-HORMONE; GUANYLYL CYCLASE RECEPTORS; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; GRANULOSA-CELLS; GONADOTROPIN RECEPTORS; PROGESTERONE SECRETION; ENDOTHELIAL PRODUCTION; ESTROUS-CYCLE; PORCINE BRAIN; DIFFERENTIATION	Natriuretic peptides form a family of structurally related peptides known to regulate salt and water homeostasis and to cause vasodilation. Synthesis of atrial (ANP), brain (BNP), and C-type (CNP) natriuretic peptides occurs mainly in the heart and brain and has been identified recently in the female reproductive tract. The expression of ANP and CNP as well as their cognate guanylyl cyclase receptors (NPR-A and NRP-B, respectively) have been detected in the rat ovary. We have shown previously that the expression of the natriuretic peptides and their receptors in the rat ovary appears to be modulated by the estrous cycle. In the present study we have evaluated the expression of the natriuretic peptide system (peptide and receptor) in ovarian cells (granulosa and thecal-interstitial cells) obtained from immature female rats treated with either diethylstilbestrol (DES), an estrogen analog, or equine CG (eCG), a gonadotropin that possesses both LH and FSH activity. Using a whole cell RRA, we found that CNP binding was increased by 2-fold in granulosa cells taken from animals treated with either DES or eCG. Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that granulosa cells from DES- or eCG-treated animals have increased levels of NPR-B messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, which was in good agreement with the increased binding. The activity of the receptors was assessed by ligand-dependent stimulation of cGMP release. CNP, but not ANP, stimulated the release of cGMP from granulosa cells obtained from DES-treated, but not from eCG-treated, animals. The relative levels of CNP mRNA in granulosa cells were unaltered by either DES or eCG treatment. In contrast, CNP mRNA levels were increased more than 2-fold, but only in theca-interstitial from the eCG-treated animals. Our results indicate that CNP and NPR-B are expressed in the ovary, and their expression is responsive to hormonal treatments. Furthermore, expression of these components of the natriuretic peptide system appears to be compartmentalized, with CNP being derived from the extrafollicular compartment and acting, through NPR-B, on the granulosa cells.

There were 8 patients (4 men), ranging in age from 31 to 68 years in three generations. One affected patient was deceased at the time of the study. Genealogical study strongly supported autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance, as three unaffected individuals transmitted the disease. Clinical anticipation could not be assessed because of the ascertainment method. Male to male transmission occurred. Identifiable antecedents for seizures were present in only two patients, who had a simple febrile convulsion and a closed head trauma, respectively. Migraine was overrepresented in this family. Onset of seizures ranged from 17 to 52 years (mean: 27 years). All patients had weekly simple partial seizures suggestive of temporal origin with vegetative or experiential phenomena. Very rare partial complex seizures occurred in 6/7 patients. One had two generalized nocturnal seizures as well. Two had previously been misdiagnosed as having gastritis or panic attacks, and one had not been diagnosed. Interictal anteromesiotemporal spiking was seen in 5/7 patients, and occurred mostly during NREM sleep. Neurological examination, brain CT or MR scans were normal. Antiepileptic medication always controlled the seizures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Arlet, V				Arlet, V			Anterior thoracoscopic spine release in deformity surgery: a meta-analysis and review	EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						scoliosis; endoscopy; thoracoscopy; thoracic disc; videoassisted thoracic surgery	FUSION; MODEL; COMPLICATIONS; THORACOTOMY; DISKECTOMY; CHILDREN	Videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) allows the surgeon to perform an anterior thoracoscopic spine release for spinal deformities. It is an alternative to open thoracotomy. Several years after its introduction the present author gives an update on the indications, surgical techniques, results, and complications of this new technology. A metaanalysis of previously published papers is organized in tables in an attempt to answer all the questions and controversies that this technique has aroused. A series of ten selected articles were available for review, comprising a total of 151 procedures. No study had any long-term follow-up. Most series were pediatric and involved a variety of etiologies (mostly neuromuscular, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, and Scheuermann's kyphosis). The surgical technique was for most authors a convex side approach in the lateral decubitus through four or more ports in the anterior or midaxillary line. Single lung ventilation was used in most cases. Posterior surgery was carried out the same day in most cases. The total number of discs excised varied between 4 and 7, but the quality of disc excision was rarely reported. Most authors carried out a spine fusion at the time of the disc release. The total VATS procedure lasted between 2 h 30 min and 4 h, depending on the series and the surgeon's previous experience. In most series curves were in the range of 55 degrees-80 degrees, with an average of 65 degrees. The percentage of Cobb angle correction was 55%-63% after VATS and posterior spine fusion. For kyphotic deformities only one series had significant numbers to allow conclusions to be drawn. The mean preoperative Cobb angle was 78 degrees and postoperatively the kyphosis was corrected to 44 degrees. Length of hospital stay was quite similar in most series and was around 9 days. The cost of the VATS procedure was studied in one series and was found to be 28% more expensive than thoracotomy. The total complications reported were 18%; most were pulmonary complications with prolonged ventilatory support in patients with neuromuscular pathologies. The VATS procedure has been used with success in most series for pediatric curves (average Cobb angle of 65 degrees or kyphosis of 75 degrees). No report of the surgical outcome (balance, rate of fusion, rib hump correction, cosmetic correction, pain, and patient satisfaction) was available for any series. Further prospective study in eluding these parameters will be required to determine the real benefit of such procedures to the patient, bearing in mind that the correction of spinal deformities is the result of the surgeon's experience, skill, and the available technology.

Radiological methods to assess fusion are not standardized and are often unreliable. Cages have been stated to provide good Segmental distraction, provide axial load support and reduce segmental mobility, but there have been reports of failed fusions because of implant failure. This paper presents a critical opinion on current cage designs, stressing their clinical and biomechanical implications. Threaded cage designs compromise endplate integrity, and when placed in pairs have inherent limitations for distraction. Non-threaded cage designs usually preserve endplate integrity, but geometry may be inadequate to provide a good surface match to the endplate. The concept of an open frame type cage is believed to have biological advantages, because large graft volumes inside the cage can be in direct contact with host bone. Cadaveric tests suggest that open frame constructs have compressive strength similar to that of full surface contact cages. Restoration of segmental height, sagittal balance and increased neuroforaminal clearance are all functions of disc space distraction. The effect of cage instrumentation on axial load distribution, however, is not well understood. Biomechanical experiments strongly suggest supplementing cage instrumentation with posterior fixation, to achieve a marked increase in initial segmental stability. In the absence of gross segmental instability, micromotion at the host graft interface may still exist. As a result, fusion will never occur, instead a pseudoarthrosis will develop. For monitoring fusion, the use of non-metallic cages has distinct advantages, because no metal artifacts will disturb radiological assessment.

A class of mutants, the eat mutants, are defective in this behavior. We have identified a novel eat gene, eat-20, encoding a unique transmembrane protein with three EGF motifs. Staining with a specific polyclonal antibody reveals that EAT-20 is expressed predominantly in the pharyngeal muscles and a subset of neurons. Some hypodermal cells also express EAT-20, eat-20 mutant animals are starved, have smaller brood sizes, and have prolonged egg-laying periods. The starvation apparently results from pharyngeal pumping defects, including a reduced pumping rate and "slippery pumping," in which the contents of the pharynx sometimes move rostrally. However, electrical activity of eat-20 mutants appears normal by electropharyngeogram.

Patterns of estrus termination following vaginocervical stimulation	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article							ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR IMMUNOREACTIVITY; PREOPTIC AREA; C-FOS; VAGINAL STIMULATION; LORDOSIS REFLEX; BRAIN; HYPOTHALAMUS; MODULATION; INTROMISSION; ESTRADIOL	Copulation with intromission or manual vaginocervical stimulation (VCS) shortens the duration that intact female rats maintain lordosis responding during estrus. The present study examined whether VCS could shorten the duration of both appetitive and consummatory measures of female sexual behavior, and whether these effects occur differentially in time and across different hormone priming intervals. Ovariectomized, sexually experienced female rats were administered subcutaneous injections of estradiol benzoate 48 h and progesterone 4 h, before receiving 50 manual VCSs with a lubricated glass rod distributed over 1 h. Control females received sham VCSs distributed over the same time. The females were then tested for sexual behavior in bilevel chambers with two sexually vigorous males (to one ejaculatory series or 10 min with each male, separated by 5 min) 12, 16, and 20 h after VCS. Prior to the final hormone treatment, different groups of females had been given the same hormone treatment either 28, 14, 7, or 4 days before. In females tested at 28- and 14-day hormone intervals, VCS induced both active and passive rejection responses at 12, 16, and 20 h. In contrast, females that received sham VCS displayed relatively normal sexual behavior at 12 h, although by 16 and 20 h these females displayed active and passive rejection. Females tested at 7- or 4-day intervals displayed normal levels of lordosis at all testing times, regardless of VCS treatment. These data indicate that VCS facilitates rejection responses that precede the decrease in lordosis responsiveness. However, the effects of VCS are dependent on the frequency of hormone priming, suggesting that hormone treatment may block some of the long-term inhibitory effects of VCS on female sexual behavior.

Nevertheless, due to the imaging process, the 3-D single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images are very blurred and, consequently, their interpretation by the clinician is often difficult and subjective. In order to improve the resolution of these 3-D images and then to facilitate their interpretation, me propose herein to extend a recent image blind deconvolution technique (called the nonnegativity support constraint-recursive inverse filtering deconvolution method) in order to improve both the spatial and the interslice resolution of SPECT volumes. This technique requires a preliminary step in order to find the support of the object to be restored. In this paper, ae propose to solve this problem with an unsupervised 3-D Markovian segmentation technique. This method has been successfully tested on numerous real and simulated brain SPECT volumes, yielding very promising restoration results.

The capabilities of the proposed structures for representing the nonlinear input-output map of the flexible manipulator are shown analytically. Selection criteria for specifying the fixed structural parameters as well as the adaptation laws for updating the adjustable parameters of the networks are provided. During identification, the two-link flexible manipulator is under nonlinear control and the input-output data sets are generated for different desired trajectories. Simulation results reveal that the proposed neuro-dynamic structures are capable of successfully identifying a highly nonlinear system without any a priori information about the nonlinearities of the system and without any off-line training.

The second step (recognition) is achieved by using a holographic nearest-neighbor algorithm (HNN), in which vectors obtained in the preprocessing step are used as inputs to it. The algorithm is tested in character recognition, using the 26 upper case letters of the alphabet. Only four different orientations and one size (for each letter) vr ere used for training. Recognition was tested with 17 different sizes and 14 rotations. The results are encouraging, since we achieved 98% correct recognition. Tolerance to boundary deformations and random noise was tested. Results for character recognition in "real" images of car plates are presented as well.

This response is mediated in part by nitric oxide (NO) and reportedly involves both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, some of which are possibly located in the vessel wall. In the present study, the vasomotor response(s) elicited by acetylcholine (ACh) on isolated and pressurized bovine and/or human intracortical penetrating arterioles were investigated, and pharmacological characterization of the receptor involved in this response was carried out. Acetylcholine (10(-11) to 10(-4) mol/L) dose dependently dilated bovine and human intracortical arterioles at spontaneous tone (respective pD(2) values of 6.4 +/- 0.3 and 7.2 +/- 0.3 and E-Amax of 65.0 +/- 26.8 and 43.2 +/- 30.1% of the maximal dilation obtained with papaverine) and bovine arterioles after preconstriction with serotonin (pD(2) = 6.3 +/- 0.1, E-Amax = 80.0 +/- 17.9% of induced tone). rn contrast, nicotine (10(-8) to 10(-4) mol/L) failed to induce any vasomotor response in bovine vessels whether at spontaneous or at pharmacologically induced tone. Application of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-omega nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 10(-5) mol/L) elicited a gradual constriction (similar to 20%) of the arterioles, indicating the presence of constitutive NO Ic lease in these vessels. N-omega-Nitro-L-argigine (10(-5) to 10(-4) mol/L) also significantly blocked the dilation induced by ACh. The muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) antagonists pirenzepine, I-DAMP, and AF-DX 384 close dependently inhibited the dilatation induced by ACh (10(-5) mol/L) with the following rank order of potency: I-DAMP (pIC(50) = 9.2 +/- 0.3) >> pirenzepine (pIC(50) = 6.7 +/- 0.4) > AF-DX 384 (pIC(50) = 5.9 +/- 0.2). These results suggest that ACh can induce a potent, dose-dependent, and NO-mediated dilation of bovine and/or human intracortical arterioles via interaction with an mAChR that best corresponds to the M5 subtype.

A/J macrophages permissive to L, pneumophila replication. The mouse Lgn1 region is syntenic with the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) locus on human chromosome 5 and includes several copies of the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (Naip) gene. We have analyzed a possible link among Lgn1, Naip, and macrophage function. RNA expression studies show that Naip (mostly copy 2) mRNA transcripts are expressed in macrophage-rich tissues such as spleen, lung, and liver and are abundant in primary macrophages, Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation analyses identify Naip protein expression in mouse macrophages and in macrophage cell lines RAW 264.7 and J774A, Interestingly, macrophages from permissive A/J mice express significantly less Naip protein than their nonpermissive C57BL/6J counterpart. Naip protein expression is increased after phagocytic events, Naip protein levels during infection with either virulent or avirulent strains of L, pneumophila increase during the first 6 h postinfection and remain elevated during the 48-h observation period, This enhanced expression is also observed in macrophages infected with Salmonella typhimurium, Likewise, an increase in Naip protein levels in macrophages is observed 24 h after phagocytosis of Lates beads. The cosegregation of Lgn1 and Naip together with the detected Naip protein expression in host macrophages as well as its modulation after phagocytic events and during intracellular infection make it an attractive, candidate for the Lgn1 locus.

Two isoforms of this protein, CNP1 and CNP2, are detectable, They differ by a 20-amino acid extension exclusive to CNP2. Additionally, CNP2 is essentially the only isoform to be phosphorylated in vivo. In this study, we examine the phosphorylation of CNP2 in transfected cells. CNP2 was selectively expressed ectopically in 293T cells and labeled with (32)p. Immunoprecipitation of labeled CNP2 and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping analyses identified serines 9 and 22 as the major sites of phosphorylation. Only serine 22 was phosphorylated initially in oligodendrocyte-enriched cultures of neonatal rat brain glial cells. However, 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) induced the phosphorylation of serine 9, thereby producing the same pattern seen in 293T cells. These results suggest that serine 9 is phosphorylated by a PDB-sensitive kinase, likely protein kinase C, and that serine 22 appears to be constitutively phosphorylated.

Endothelial cells are the first cells of the blood-brain barrier encountered by migrating lymphocytes. To investigate the antigen-presenting capacity of human adult brain endothelial cells (HBECs), we used HBECs derived from surgically resected temporal lobe tissue, cocultured with allogeneic peripheral blood derived CD4(+) T lymphocytes, HBECs in response to IFN-gamma, but not under basal culture conditions, expressed HLA-DR, B7.1 and B7.2 antigens. Despite such up-regulation, these IFN-gamma-treated HBECs, in contrast to human microglia and PB monocytes, did not sustain allogeneic CD4(+) cell proliferation, supported only low levels of IL-2 and IFN-gamma production, and did not stimulate IL-2 receptor expression. CD4(+) T cell proliferation and increased IL-2 receptor expression could be obtained by addition of IL-2. Our data suggests that, although HBECs cannot alone support T cell proliferation and cytokine production, HBECs acting in concert with cytokines derived from a proinflammatory environment could support such a response.

J	Krnjevic, K; Zhao, YT				Krnjevic, K; Zhao, YT			2-deoxyglucose-induced long-term potentiation of monosynaptic IPSPs in CA1 hippocampal neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							INHIBITORY SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION; DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS; RECEPTOR FUNCTION; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; VISUAL-CORTEX; GABA; PLASTICITY; LTP; MODULATION	In previous experiments on excitatory synaptic transmission in CA1, temporary (10-20 min) replacement of glucose with 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) consistently caused a marked and very sustained potentiation (2-DG LTP). To find out whether 2-DG has a similar effect on inhibitory synapses, we recorded pharmacologically isolated mononosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs; under current clamp) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs; under voltage clamp); 2-DG was applied both in the presence and the absence of antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). In spite of sharply varied results (some neurons showing large potentiation, lasting for >1 h, and many little or none), overall there was a significant and similar potentiation of IPSP conductance, both for the early (at approximate to 30 ms) and later (at approximate to 140 ms) components of IPSPs or IPSCs: by 35.1 +/- 10.25% (mean +/- SE;for n = 24, P = 0.0023) and 36.5 +/- 16.3% (for n = 19, P = 0.038), respectively. The similar potentiation of the early and late IPSP points to a presynaptic mechanism of LTP. Overall, the LTP was statistically significant only when 2-DG was applied in the absence of glutamate antagonists. Tetanic stimulations (in presence or absence of glutamate antagonists) only depressed IPSPs (by half). In conclusion, although smaller and more variable, 2-DG-induced LTP of inhibitory synapses appears to be broadly similar to the 2-DG-induced LTP of excitatory postsynaptic potentials previously observed in CA1.

It has been proposed that the emergence of DB underlies the therapeutic and side effects of this drug. However, the relevance of DB to the clinical actions of haloperidol has been questioned on the grounds that chronic drug-induced DB has not yet been demonstrated in freely moving animals. In this study, responding for rewarding electrical brain stimulation was used to assess the occurrence of DB in rats chronically treated with haloperidol or clozapine. The time course of the effects of acute haloperidol (7.8-500 mu g/kg) and clozapine (5-40 mg/kg) and of withdrawal from chronic drug treatment on reward and performance measures were also characterized. Haloperidol and clozapine dose-dependently attenuated reward and performance, haloperidol producing a predominant suppression of performance, and clozapine preferentially attenuating reward. Chronic (21 d) treatment with haloperidol (500 mg/kg) caused responding to cease in the six rats tested, and repeated injection with apomorphine restored the behavior in all of them; such an effect of apomorphine was observed in only two of six rats treated acutely with the same dose of haloperidol. Chronic treatment with clozapine (20 mg/kg) increased reward thresholds, an effect that was reversed by apomorphine in chronically, but not acutely, treated rats. The times at which chronic haloperidol-treated rats resumed responding was positively correlated with indices of behavioral supersensitivity after withdrawal, suggesting that the effect of apomorphine was not caused by direct stimulation of upregulated postsynaptic receptors. These findings constitute the first behavioral evidence of DB in unanesthetized, freely moving animals treated chronically with antipsychotics. They also demonstrate that the neural substrates mediating reward and performance are functionally independent and differentially sensitive to haloperidol and clozapine.

Changes in cortical representation in patients with cerebral lesions may alter the correlation between cortical anatomy and function. This is of potential clinical significance when the extent of cortical resection is based on surface anatomical landmarks. Methods. Fifty-one patients with supratentorial lesions were studied. Nineteen harbored noncentral lesions (no involvement of pre- or postcentral gyrus), whereas 32 had central lesions. Control studies consisted of stimulation of the hand contralateral to the unaffected hemisphere. Positron emission tomography activation studies were performed using the [O-15]H2O tracer. Somatosensory stimulation of the hand or foot was performed using a mechanical vibrator. Motor activation consisted of hand clenching or foot tapping. The t-statistic volumes were generated from images showing the mean change in regional cerebral blood flow, and coregistered with a T-1-weighted magnetic resonance image. At the threshold selected, exclusive contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex activation was elicited in 100% of the control studies. A different pattern of cortical activation was associated with central lesions in 35 (78%) of 45 patients, which occurred significantly more often than with noncentral lesions (eight [31%] of 26 patients). The most common difference in the pattern of activation with central lesions was activation of cortical regions outside the central area (including the supplementary sensorimotor area and the secondary somatosensory cortex). No sensorimotor activation was observed in gyri adjacent to the pre- or postcentral gyrus. Conclusions. Central lesions are more frequently associated with altered patterns in activation than lesions in noncentral locations. Characteristic patterns include activation of secondary sensorimotor areas. The absence of activation in gyri adjacent to the sensorimotor strip has clinical significance for the planning of resections in the central area.

Applications of veratridine (25 mu M) or increasing extracellular concentrations of K+ (6-100 mM) induced robust increases of endogenous ACh release (similar to 500-15,000 fmol/well/10 min). Release stimulated with K+ (25 mM) was sustainable and did not differ significantly over 180 min. ACh release was dependent on extracellular choline and decreased proportionally to choline concentrations (0-10 mu M). For example, after 30 min of stimulation with K+ (25 mM), release in the absence of extracellular choline was similar to 25% of that associated with 10 mM choline. The vesicular transport blocker vesamicol (0-5 mu M) almost completely prevented stimulated and basal ACh release at the highest concentration evaluated, which suggests a mostly vesicular mode of release in this model. The M-2-like muscarinic receptor antagonist AF-DX 384 (0-10 mu M) enhanced stimulated ACh release (similar to 150% at the highest concentration evaluated), whereas the nonspecific muscarinic receptor agonist oxotremorine (0-10 mu M) decreased stimulated release (similar to 60% at the highest concentration evaluated), suggesting that functional muscarinic autoreceptors exist in primary embryonic septal cultures. Novel findings concerning ACh release from primary embryonic septal cultures are reported herein, and the demonstration of ACh release gives further credit to the use of these cultures for studying cholinergic system functioning and in relation to physiology and pathology.

In these transgenic mice, however, the fragmentation of the neuronal GA was associated with cytoplasmic and mitochondrial vacuoles not seen in ALS. The present new series of transgenic mice expressing 14-17 trans gene copies of SOD1(G93A), compared to 25 copies in the mice we studied previously, showed consistent fragmentation of the GA of spinal cord motor neurons, axonal swellings, Lewy-like body inclusions in neurons and glia, but none of the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial vacuoles originally reported. Thus, this animal model recapitulates the clinical and most neuropathological findings of sporadic ALS. Neurofilaments (NF) accumulate in axons and, less often, in neuronal perikarya in most cases of sporadic ALS and they have been implicated in its pathogenesis. In order to investigate whether fragmentation of the neuronal GA also occurs in association with accumulation of perikaryal NFs, we studied the organelle in transgenic mice expressing the heavy subunit of human neurofilaments (NF-H) which developed a motor neuronopathy resembling ALS. The neuronal GA of mice expressing NF-H, however, was intact despite massive accumulation of NFs in both perikarya and axons of motor neurons. In contrast, in transgenic mice expressing SOD1(G93A), the GA was fragmented despite the absence of accumulation of perikaryal NFs. These findings suggest that, in transgenic mice with neuronopathies caused by the expression of mutant SOD1(G93A) or the human NF-H, the GA and the perikaryal NFs are independently involved in the pathogenesis. The evidence suggests that the GA plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the vast majority of sporadic ALS and in FALS with SOD1 mutations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

J	Drouin, J				Drouin, J			Selector genes, limb identity and laterality in vertebrates	M S-MEDECINE SCIENCES			French	Article							LEFT-RIGHT ASYMMETRY; CHICK EMBRYOGENESIS; SPECIFICATION; MORPHOGENESIS; PATHWAY	Early in the development of the embryo the primary axes are defined morphologically ana at the molecular level. The recent discovery of vertebrate homeodomain-containing transcription factors related to drosophila bicoid has revealed that many of these factors play a role in specification of identity for large embryonic fields. Whereas Otx2 was previously shown to confer identity to the most rostral neuroepithelium and has been postulated to play a role in the head organizer function, the recently identified genes Pitx1 and Pitx2 behave as determinants of posterior and left lateral plate mesoderm, respectively. Pitx1 thus appears to be at the head of a regulatory cascade for specification of hindlimb identity. This cascade includes Tbx4, a brachyury-related gene, expressed only in hindlimbs in contrast to the related Tbx5 gene which appears to play a similar role in forelimbs. Pitx2 is uniquely expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm and appears to be the transcriptional effector for development of asymmetric internal organs such as the heart, stomach, intestine and lungs. Its expression in the left lateral plate mesoderm is under stringent control of a regulatory cascade that has been best defined in chicken. The discovery of the Pitx genes has provided the first molecular insight into the mechanisms for the development of non-symmetrical structures in vertebrates.

The paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei are major integration centers for the output of the hypothalamus to the pituitary. The bHLH-PAS transcription factor SIM1 is crucial for the development of several neuroendocrine lineages within the PVN and SON. bHLH-PAS proteins require heterodimerization for their function. ARNT, ARNT2, and BMAL1 are the three known general heterodimerization partners for bHLH-PAS proteins. Here. we provide evidence that Sim1 and Arnt2 form dimers in vitro, that they are co-expressed in the PVN and SON, and that their loss of function affects the development of the same sets of neuroendocrine cell types within the PVN and SON. Together, these results implicate ARNT2 as the in vivo dimerization partner of SIM1 in controlling the development of these neuroendocrine lineages. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

D3 binds the Ig-like C2 region of the extracellular domain of TrkA, competes the binding of another TrkA agonist, affords selective trophic protection to TrkA-expressing cell lines and neuronal primary cultures, and induces the differentiation of primary neuronal cultures. These results indicate that a small beta-turn peptidomimetic can activate a tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptor that normally binds a relatively large protein ligand. Agents such as D3 that bind the extracellular domain of Trk receptors will be useful pharmacological agents to address disorders where Trk receptors play a role, by targeting populations selectively.

We previously mapped the gene responsible for ARSACS to chromosome 13q11 and identified two ancestral haplotypes. Here we report the cloning of this gene, SAGS, which encodes the protein sacsin. The ORF of SAGS is 11,487 bp and is encoded by a single gigantic exon spanning 12,794 bp. This exon is the largest to be identified in any vertebrate organism. The ORF is conserved in human and mouse. The putative protein contains three large segments with sequence similarity to each other and to the predicted protein of an Arabidopsis thaliana ORF. The presence of heat-shock domains suggests a function for sacsin in chaperone-mediated protein folding. SAGS is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the central nervous system. We identified two SAGS mutations in ARSACS families that lead to protein truncation, consistent with haplotype analysis.

Here we show psychophysically that circles are perceived in these patterns only around specific points that are quantitatively predicted by a neural model of configural units hypothesized to reside in cortical area V4. Circles superimposed on the pattern mask perception of illusory circles. A neural model of lateral inhibitory interactions among V4 configural units showing spike-frequency adaptation quantitatively accounts for the human data. The model is consistent with ideas on the neural basis of attention in V4, and it suggests that attention may be biased via neuromodulation of slow hyperpolarizing potentials in cortical neurons.

Oxidative stress is believed to play an important role in neuronal dysfunction and cell death in AD. We now provide evidence that in the hippocampus of AD, the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and the APOE genotype are linked. Within AD cases, the levels of TBARS were found to be higher among epsilon 4 carriers while the apoE protein concentrations were lower. The relationship between the levels of TBARS and apoE proteins was corroborated by the results from the APOE-deficient mice, in which the levels of TBARS were higher than those in wild-type mice. Among AD cases, tissues from patients with the E4 allele of APOE displayed lower activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase and lower concentration of glutathione than tissues from patients homozygous for the epsilon 3 allele of APOE. Together these data demonstrate that, in AD, the epsilon 4 allele of APOE is associated with higher oxidative insults. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Because survival time in the absence of effective therapy is short, the ability to predict the potential chemosensitivity of individual brain tumors noninvasively would represent a significant advance in chemotherapy planning. METHODS: Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1 MRSI), we studied 16 patients with a recurrent malignant glioma before and during treatment with high-dose orally administered tamoxifen. We evaluated whether 1H MRSI data could predict eventual therapeutic response to tamoxifen at the pretreatment and early treatment stages. RESULTS: Seven patients responded to tamoxifen therapy (three with glioblastomas multiforme; four with anaplastic astrocytomas), and nine did not (six with glioblastomas multiforme; three with anaplastic astrocytomas). Responders and nonresponders exhibited no differences in their age, sex, tumor type, mean tumor volume, mean Karnofsky scale score, mean number of weeks postradiotherapy, or mean amount of prior radiation exposure. Resonance profiles across the five metabolites measured on H-1 MRSI spectra (choline-containing compounds, creatine and phosphocreatine, N-acetyl groups, lactate, and lipids) differed significantly between these two groups before and during treatment. Furthermore, linear discriminant analyses based on patients' in vivo biochemical information accurately predicted individual response to tamoxifen both before and at very early treatment stages (2 and 4 wk). Similar analyses based on patient sex, age, Karnofsky scale score, tumor type, and tumor volume could not reliably predict the response to tamoxifen treatment at the same time periods. CONCLUSION: It is possible to accurately predict the response of a tumor to tamoxifen on the basis of noninvasively acquired in vivo biochemical information. H-1 MRSI has potential as a prognostic tool in the pharmacological treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas.

More recently, motilin receptors were identified in the colon where their biologic significance remains unclear. We aimed here to characterize the motilin receptors of the rabbit colon. Distal colon and duodenum were obtained from sacrificed rabbits. Tissues homogenized by Polytron were submitted to differential centrifugation to obtain neural synaptosomes or smooth muscle plasma membranes enriched solutions. Motilin binding to these membranes was determined by the displacement of I-125 MOT by the native peptide MOT 1-22, or by peptide analogues MOT 1-12 [CH2NH](10-11) or GM-109 and by erythromycin derivative GM-611. Motilin binding capacity was maximum in colon nerves (49.5 +/- 6.5 fmol/mg protein vs. 19.9 +/- 2.5 in colon muscles or 9.4 +/- 2.8 and 6.6 +/- 1.2 in duodenal muscles and antral nerves respectively); all tissues expressed similar affinity for MOT 1-22, and the motilin agonist GM-611 bound equally to neural or muscle tissues from the rabbit colon; the synthetic antagonist MOT 1-12 [CH2NH](10-11) showed greater affinity for colon nerves than for colon muscles (pIC50: 7.23 +/- 0.07 vs. 6.75 +/- 0.03). Similar results were obtained with the peptide antagonist GM-109; receptor affinity toward MOT 1-12 [CH2NH10-11] was always five times superior in neural tissues, whether they came from the colon or the antrum, than in muscle tissues, whether they were obtained From colon or from duodenum. Motilin receptors are found in very high concentration in nerves and in muscles from rabbit colon: specific motilin receptor subtypes are identified in nerves (N) and muscles (M) of the rabbit colon; N acid M receptor subtypes seem independent of the organ location.

J	Bader, G; Lavigne, G				Bader, G; Lavigne, G			Sleep bruxism; an overview of an oromandibular sleep movement disorder	SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS			English	Review						bruxism; sleep; teeth clenching; teeth grinding; parasomnia	CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; NOCTURNAL BRUXISM; MOTOR-ACTIVITY; PAIN-DYSFUNCTION; SPLINT THERAPY; CLINICAL-TRIAL; MUSCLE PAIN; L-DOPA; FIBROMYALGIA; PROPRANOLOL	Sleep bruxism (SB) is a stereotyped movement disorder characterized by grinding or clenching of the teeth driving sleep. The majority of the population will at some time during their lifetime,grind or clench their teeth. It becomes a pathological condition when the subject presents severe tooth damage or complains of non-restorative sleep. The prevalence of SB is difficult to estimate, since quite often the subjects are unaware of having the disorder. There is no gender difference. SB is more frequent ill the younger generation, with a decline over age. The symptom recognized in children can persist in adulthood. The aetio-pathophysiology is still unclear. SB has been associated with tooth interference, psychosocial and environmental factors, brain transmitters and basal ganglia dysfunction. Attempts have been made to specify the personality traits of bruxers, reported to be greater anxiety or vulnerability to stress; however, this is still controversial. SB subjects were observed to present vigilance-sleepiness and somatic problems. However, they are generally good sleepers. Some authors reported SB during all sleep stages, others observed the majority of bruxe episodes during light sleep and REM and often associated with arousal transients. No abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system could be shown in awake SB subjects. While some studies have shown ail association between SB and PLM or breathing disorders, others did not confirm this. There is no specific treatment for SB: each subject has to be individually evaluated and treated. Three management alternatives are used: dental, pharmacological and psychobehavioural, (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

glutamate antagonists; neuroprotection; stroke, acute; stroke therapy	ISCHEMIC STROKE; HYPERGLYCEMIA; TRIAL	Background and Purpose-GV150526, a selective glycine site antagonist, reduces infarct volume in rats with focal cerebral ischemia. Safety and efficacy in humans with acute stroke are being investigated, We sought to further explore the safety. pharmacokinetics, and preliminary outcome of GV150526 treatment in patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke. Methods-Two trials were conducted in North America. The North American Glycine Antagonist in Neuroprotection trial (GAIN 1) (GLYA2001; United States only) was designed as a sequential dose escalation study. GAIN 2 (GLYA2005; United States and Canada) was designed to further assess the safety of the highest dose tolerated in GAIN 1. Both trials were randomized (2:1), double-blind, and placebo controlled, Treatment was started within 12 hours of symptom onset; patients with both ischemic stroke and primary intracerebral hemorrhage were included in both trials. Results-The dose escalation study (GAIN 1) completed 3 dosing tiers. Enrollment was suspended before escalation to the fourth tier because of laboratory reports of transiently elevated bilirubin levels in a concurrent European study that employed the dose targeted for this tier. After review by an independent safety committee of the worldwide safety data, the second study (GAIN 2) commenced. One hundred nine patients were randomized and dosed with study drug, either an 800-mg loading dose followed by 200 mg every 12 hours for 3 days of GV150526 or placebo. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in the drug and placebo groups. Mild irritation at the infusion site and symptoms suggestive of mild and reversible altered mentation were reported more frequently in the GV150526 group than in the placebo group. Hyperbilirubinemia was reported in 6% of GV150526-treated patients compared with 3% of placebo-treated patients. Outcome at 4 weeks after stroke was better in GV150526-treated patients, but the studies were not powered to show statistical significance, and the baseline neurological deficits in the GV150526-treated patients were less severe. Conclusions-These preliminary studies suggest that GV150526 is well tolerated by patients with suspected acute stroke. Further pivotal studies testing the efficacy and safety of GV150526 in acute stroke are ongoing.

We studied the vasomotor mode of actions of the peroxidation product 15-F-2t-isoprostane (15-F-2t-IsoP) (8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 alpha) On periventricular region during development. Methods-Effects of 15-F-2t-IsoP on periventricular microvessels of fetal, newborn, and juvenile pigs were studied by video imaging and digital analysis techniques, Thromboxane formation and intracellular Ca2+ were measured by radioimmunoassay and by using the fluorescent indicator fura 2-AM. Results-15-F-2t-IsoP-mediated constriction of periventricular microvessels decreased as a function of age such that in the fetus it was approximate to 2.5-fold greater than in juvenile pigs, 15-F-2t-IsoP evoked more thromboxane formation in the fetus than in the newborn, which was greater than that in the juvenile periventricular region; this was associated with immunoreactive thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) synthase expression in the fetus that was greater than that in newborn pigs, which was greater than that in juvenile pigs. 15-F-2t-IsoP-induced vasoconstriction was markedly inhibited by TXA(2) synthase and receptor blockers (CGS12970 and L670596), Vasoconstrictor effects of the TXA(2) mimetic U46619 on fetal, neonatal, and juvenile periventricular microvessels did not differ, 15-F-2t-IsoP increased TXA(2) synthesis by activating Ca2+ influx through non-voltage-gated channels in endothelial cells (SK&F96365 sensitive) and N-type voltage-gated channels (omega-conotoxin sensitive) in astrocytes; smooth muscle cells were not responsive to 15-F-2t-IsoP but generated Ca-2t transients to U46619 via L-type voltage-sensitive channels, Conclusions-15-F-2t-IsoP causes periventricular brain region vasoconstriction in the fetus that is greater than that in the newborn, which in turn is greater than that in the juvenile due to greater TXA(2) formation generated through distinct stimulatory pathways, including from endothelial and astroglial cells. The resulting hemodynamic compromise may contribute to the increased vulnerability of the periventricular brain areas to oxidant stress-induced injury in immature subjects.

In addition, in order to examine the effect of the regenerating axons on cellular responses in the visual pathways, we did a similar analysis of animals with the right eye removed (ER). Finally, we used double labeling protocols to demonstrate that the proliferating cells that we were counting were mostly phagocytic cells of the mononuclear lineage. In animals with an ONC, we observed an early burst of proliferation that peaked between 7 and 14 days after surgery in all parts of the visual system. Zn the optic tract, there was also a secondary rise that peaked at ?1 days. Levels of proliferation returned to normal by 32 days postoperative in the tract and tectum, while they remained somewhat elevated in the optic nerve for at least 93 days. The total number of non-neuronal cells in the visual paths also rose to peak values between 7 and 14 days after ONC surgery. In the optic tract and tectum the values fell rapidly after this time, while in the optic nerve, there was a secondary peak at 32 days after which values remained elevated for the duration of the experiment. As compared to animals with an ONC, enucleation resulted in elevated proliferation and hyperplasia at early postoperative intervals. However, because these differences occurred when axons had not vet regenerated into the affected structures, these data do not provide strong evidence for a direct effect of regenerating optic axons on the early cellular responses during Wallerian degeneration in the goldfish. In addition, in the tectum, there was an early increment in cell number that was not associated with elevated levels of proliferation. We believe that this increment represents immigration of resident microglia from other regions of the brain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Coimmunoprecipitation of P-gp and caveolin from CH(R)C5 lysates suggests that there is a physical interaction between them. Furthermore, co-localization of P-gp and caveolin was found in caveolae from brain capillaries, indicating that this association also takes place in vivo.

Within the endoplasmic reticulum of LoVo cells, proSKI-1 is converted to SKI-1 by processing of its prosegment into 26-, 24-, 14-, 10-, and 8-kDa products, some of which remain tightly associated with the enzyme. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis were used to map the cleavage sites of the most abundant fragments, which were confirmed by synthetic peptide processing. To characterize its in vitro enzymatic properties, we generated a secreted form of SKI-1. Our data demonstrate that SKI-1 is a Ca2+-dependent proteinase exhibiting optimal cleavage at pH 6.5. We present evidence that SKI-1 processes peptides mimicking the cleavage sites of the SKI-1 prosegment, pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the sterol regulatory element-binding protein SREBP-2. Among the candidate peptides encompassing sections of the SKI-1 prosegment, the RSLK137-,and RRLL186-containing peptides were best cleaved by this enzyme. Mutagenesis of the latter peptide allowed us to develop an efficiently processed SKI-I substrate and to assess the importance of several P and P' residues. Finally, we demonstrate that, in vitro, recombinant prosegments of SKI-1 inhibit its activity with apparent inhibitor constants of 100-200 nM.

Methods: We reviewed charts of children with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke seen at Hopital Sainte-Justine, Montreal between 1991 and 1997. Results: We found 51 ischemic strokes: 46 arterial and 5 sinovenous thromboses. Risk factors were variable and multiple in 12 (24%) of the 51 ischemic strokes. Ischemic stroke recurred in 3 (8%) patients with a single or no identified risk factor and in 5 (42%) of 12 patients with multiple risk factors (p = 0.01). We also found 21 hemorrhagic strokes, 14 (67%) of which were caused by vascular abnormalities. No patient with hemorrhagic stroke had multiple risk factors. Hemorrhagic stroke recurred in two patients (10%). Outcome in all 72 stroke patients was as follows: asymptomatic, 36%; symptomatic epilepsy or persistent neurologic deficit, 45%; and death, 20%. Death occurred more frequently in patients with recurrent stroke (40%) than in those with nonrecurrent stroke (16%). Conclusions: Multiple risk factors are found in many ischemic strokes and may predict stroke recurrence. Recurrent stroke tends to increase rate of mortality. Because of the high prevalence and importance of multiple risk factors, a complete investigation, including hematologic and metabolic studies and angiography, should be considered in every child with ischemic stroke, even when a cause is known.

Although the perception of speaker-related features of voice plays a major role in human communication, little is known about its neural basis(4-7) Here:we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in human volunteers, that voice-selective regions can be found bilaterally along the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS), These regions showed greater neuronal activity when subjects listened passively to vocal sounds, whether speech or non-speech, than to non-vocal environmental sounds. Central STS regions also displayed a high degree of selectivity by responding significantly more to vocal sounds than to matched control stimuli, including scrambled voices and amplitude-modulated noise. Moreover, their response to stimuli degraded by frequency filtering paralleled the subjects' behavioural performance in voice-perception tasks that used these stimuli. The voice-selective areas in the STS may represent the counterpart of the face-selective areas in human visual cortex(8,9); their existence sheds new light on the functional architecture of the human auditory cortex.

In this study, we examined the distribution of the endogenous NAIP protein in normal human spinal cord and brain tissue by using a polyclonal antibody against NAIP. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that NAIP is strongly expressed in anterior horn and motor cortex neurons of normal brains, and it is not altered in the remaining motor neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). NAIP is also located in human fetal neurons and in adult choroid plexus cells. These results suggest that the antiapoptotic molecule NAIP may be important in motor neurons, but it specifically does not appear to be altered in ALS.

PPs lasted up to about 2s, and disappeared during application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. Topiramate (10-100 mu M, n = 22 neurons) decreased and eventually abolished in a dose-dependent manner these PPs, even when the function of excitatory amino acid and GABA(A) receptors was blocked. Hence, topiramate depresses muscarinic receptor-dependent PPs in the rat subiculum, thus suggesting that this form of excitation may represent a target for the mechanism of action of this antiepileptic compound.

We compared the sleep of eight patients with AS with that of participants matched for age and gender. Patients with AS showed decreased sleep rime in the first two-thirds of the night, increased number of shifts into REM sleep from a waking epoch, and all but one patient showed signs of REM sleep disruption. EEG sleep spindles were significantly decreased while K complexes and REM sleep rapid eye movements were normal. Three patients with AS, but none of the comparison participants, showed a pathological index of periodic leg movements in sleep. These observations show that sleep disorders are associated with AS and suggest that defective sleep control systems may be associated with the clinical picture of AS.

These receptors have high calcium permeability and exhibit strong inward rectification, two important physiological features that enable them to facilitate transmitter release. Previously, we showed that intracellular polyamines act as gating molecules to block neuronal nAChRs in a voltage-dependent manner, leading to inward rectification. Our goal is to identify the structural determinants that underlie the block by intracellular polyamines and govern calcium permeability of neuronal nAChRs. We hypothesize that two ring-like collections of negatively charged amino acids (cytoplasmic and intermediate rings) near the intracellular mouth of the pore mediate the interaction with intracellular polyamines and also influence calcium permeability. Using site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology on alpha(4)beta(2) and alpha(3)beta(4) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, we observed that removing the five negative charges of the cytoplasmic ring had little effect on either inward rectification or calcium permeability. However, partial removal of negative charges of the intermediate ring diminished the high-affinity, voltage-dependent interaction between intracellular polyamines and the receptor, abolishing inward rectification. In addition, these non-rectifying mutant receptors showed a drastic reduction in calcium permeability. Our results indicate that the negatively charged glutamic acid residues at the intermediate ring form both a high-affinity binding site for intracellular polyamines and a selectivity filter for inflowing calcium ions; that is, a common site links inward rectification and calcium permeability of neuronal nAChRs. Physiologically, this molecular mechanism provides insight into how presynaptic nAChRs act to influence transmitter release.

We have modified some of the techniques of classical quantal analysis and examined the kinetics of synaptic depression under different stimulation protocols to answer this question. Our analysis shows that both synaptic depression caused by homosynaptic activity and synaptic facilitation induced by an endogenous facilitatory transmitter occur by means of the shutting off and turning on, respectively, of synaptic sites, without intermediate changes in the probability of release. Our findings imply that other forms of plasticity at these synapses, such as post-tetanic potentiation, long-term facilitation, and long-term potentiation, are also expressed by all-or-none changes in activity at individual sites. We thus show that in addition to the mechanisms of synaptic integration that are known to operate in single cells and networks, neurons can exercise a further layer of fine control, at the level of individual release sites.

However, it has not been determined whether BDNF promotes the survival of 5-HT axons during PCA-insult or facilitates their regenerative sprouting after injury. We show here that BDNF fails to protect most 5-HT axons from PCA-induced degeneration. Instead, chronic BDNF infusions markedly stimulate the sprouting of both intact and PCA-lesioned 5-HT axons, leading to a hyperinnervation at the neocortical infusion site. BDNF treatment promoted the regrowth of 5-HT axons when initiated up to a month after PCA administration. The sprouted axons persisted in cortex for at least 5 weeks after terminating exogenous BDNF delivery. BDNF also encouraged the regrowth of the 5-HT plexus in the hippocampus, but only in those lamina where 5-HT axons normally ramify. In addition, intracortical BDNF infusions induced a sustained local activation of the TrkB receptor. The dose-response profiles for BDNF to stimulate 5-HT sprouting and Trk signaling were remarkably similar, suggesting a physiological link between the two events; both responses were maximal at intermediate doses of BDNF but declined at higher doses ("inverted-U-shaped" dose-response curves). Underlying the downregulation of the Trk signal with excessive BDNF was a decline in full-length TrkB protein, but not truncated TrkB protein or TrkB mRNA levels. Thus, BDNF-TrkB signaling does not protect 5-HT neurons from axonal injury, but has a fundamental role in promoting the structural plasticity of these neurons in the adult brain.

We reported previously that repeated amphetamine treatment results in increased astrocytic expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra compacta (SNc) and that this effect is prevented by coadministration of a nonspecific glutamate receptor antagonist. Here we show that the development of sensitization to amphetamine is prevented when amphetamine injections are preceded by infusions of a neutralizing antibody to bFGF into the VTA. In addition, we show that astrocytic bFGF expression is increased in the VTA and SNc of animals that exhibit behavioral sensitization and that the number of bFGF-immunoreactive astrocytes in these regions is strongly and positively correlated with the magnitude of sensitization. Cotreatment with an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist blocks both the development of behavioral sensitization and bFGF induction. These results show that endogenous bFGF is necessary for the development of sensitization to amphetamine and suggest that bFGF mediates the glutamatergic-dopaminergic interaction that initiates the long-term consequences of repeated drug use.

We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a splice variant of beta 1, termed beta 1A, that results from an apparent intron retention event. beta 1 and beta 1A are structurally homologous proteins with type I membrane topology; however, they contain little to no amino acid homology beyond the shared Ig loop region. beta 1A mRNA expression is developmentally regulated in rat brain such that it is complementary to beta 1. beta 1A mRNA is expressed during embryonic development, and then its expression becomes undetectable after birth, concomitant with the onset of beta 1 expression, In contrast, beta 1A mRNA is expressed in adult adrenal gland and heart. Western blot analysis revealed beta 1A protein expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and adrenal gland but not in adult brain or spinal cord. Immunocytochemical analysis of beta 1A expression revealed selective expression in brain and spinal cord neurons, with high expression in heart and all dorsal root ganglia neurons. Co-expression of alpha IIA and beta 1A subunits in Chinese hamster lung 1610 cells results in a 2.5-fold increase in sodium current density compared with cells expressing alpha IIA alone. This increase in current density reflected two effects of beta 1A: 1) an increase in the proportion of cells expressing detectable sodium currents and 2) an increase in the level of functional sodium channels in expressing cells. [H-3]Saxitoxin binding analysis revealed a 4-fold increase in B-max with no change in K-D in cells coexpressing alpha IIA and beta 1A compared with cells expressing alpha IIA alone. beta 1A-expressing cell lines also revealed subtle differences in sodium channel activation and inactivation. These effects of beta 1A subunits on sodium channel function may be physiologically important events in the development of excitable cells.

At five stimulation sites near the fornix, the effectiveness of the rewarding electrical stimulation was enhanced by chronic food restriction and attenuated by intracerebroventricular infusion of leptin. In contrast, the rewarding effect of stimulating neighboring sites was insensitive to chronic food restriction and was enhanced by leptin in three of four cases. These opposing effects of Leptin may mirror complementary changes in the rewarding effects of feeding and of competing behaviors.

Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations increased significantly within 5 min, reached a peak at 15 min, and declined by 30 min to still-elevated values maintained for 180 min. Changes in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were the mirror image of those of AVP, Plasma ANP levels were correlated with decreased ANP in the left ventricle at 30 min and increased ANP mRNA in the right atrium at 180 min. All urinary changes were reversed by a potent AVP type 2 receptor (V2R) antagonist. Control 0.9% NaCl injections evoked an immediate increase in blood pressure and heart rate measured by telemetry within 3-5 min, This elevation of blood pressure was markedly inhibited by CRH (5 mu g). We hypothesize that the effects are mediated by rapid, direct vasodilation induced by CRH that decreases baroreceptor input to the brain stem, leading to a rapid release of AVP that induces the antidiuresis by direct action on the V(2)Rs in the kidney. Simultaneously, acting on V(2)Rs in the heart, AVP inhibits ANP release and synthesis, resulting in a decrease in renal cGMP output that is responsible for the antinatriuretic and antikaliuretic effects.

Six cortices were obtained from monkeys of a variety of ages: five from developing animals with ages spanning the critical period and one adult. At post-natal day (PD) 0, immunohistochemistry with the SMI-32 antibody revealed immunoreactive (IR) cells in layer IVB and in infragranular layer VI. Early in the critical period (PD 7), these layers become more defined with an increase in the density of immunopositive cells. At the height of the critical period (PD 30 and 42), a drastic increase in the density of SMI-32 labelled pyramidal neurons in layers V and VI was observed. Similarly, layer IVC showed an abundance of dendritic fragments and dendrites that appeared to originate from the infragranular layers. At the end of the critical period (PD 103), a trend toward morphological maturation for individual neurons found within each layer was observed. During any developmental time point, neurons at first appearance tended to show an immature morphology with staining largely restricted to the cell bodies. As such, the characteristic arborizations common to mature pyramidal and multipolar cells was not evident. We propose that the staining pattern seen in this study is consistent with the idea that layers anatomically associated with the magnocellular (M) pathway develop earlier than their parvocellular (P) counterparts.

There are two major drawbacks of ITFs that limit their use in the CNS - cell-type expression specificity and stimulus-transcription coupling uncertainty. Recent technical advances in the field of molecular activity mapping now permit dual-labeling approaches that help resolve some of these ambiguities and identify neurons that are activated by different sensory stimuli. Furthermore, the recent identification of the robl/LC7-like gene, which shows immediate-early repression after stimulation, may have utility in functional mapping where it can be used to delineate quiescent neurons and serve as a complement to molecular activity markers.

As parr of a series of studies to address these issues, the effects of moderate drinking (60-90g ethanol per day) or heavy drinking (> 100 g ethanol pet. day) on peripheral nervous function and thiamine status was measured in 73 patients admitted to a detoxification unit. Electromyographic evaluation revealed significant reductions in median and ulnar sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities in both moderate drinkers (n = 30) and heavy drinkers (n = 43) compared to age-matched controls. Twelve moderate drinkers and 25 heavy drinkers manifested clinical neurological signs of peripheral neuropathy. Thiamine deficiency, as revealed by erythrocyte transketolase activation assay, was detected in two moderate drinkers and seven heavy drinkers but was not significantly correlated with electromyographic alterations with the exception of ulnar nerves. These findings provide evidence for significant early peripheral nerve dysfunction in moderate drinkers and a possible contributory role of thiamine deficiency to the ulnar nerve conduction deficits. Whether deficits in other water-soluble vitamins or a direct neurotoxic effect of ethanol are implicated in alcoholic peripheral neuropathy awaits further studies.

In this paper we propose a new architecture for modeling high-dimensional data that requires resources (parameters and computations) that grow only at most as the square of the number of variables, using a multi-layer neural network to represent the joint distribution of the variables as the product of conditional distributions. The neural network can be interpreted as a graphical model without hidden random variables, but in which the conditional distributions are tied through the hidden units. The connectivity of the neural network can be pruned by using dependency tests between the variables. Experiments on modeling the distribution of several discrete data sets show statistically significant improvements over other methods such as naive Bayes and comparable Bayesian networks, and show that significant improvements can be obtained by pruning the network.

The selectivity of this injury could be conferred either by the properties of the effecters or the targets. The former would involve antigen specific recognition by either antibody or T cell receptor of the adaptive immune system. OLs are also susceptible to non antigen restricted injury mediated by components of the innate immune system including macrophages/microglia and NK cells. Target related selectivity could reflect the expression of death inducing surface receptors (such as Fas or TNFR-1) required for interaction with effector mediators and subsequent intracellular signaling pathways, including the caspase cascade. Development of therapeutic delivery systems, which would reach the site of disease activity within the CNS, will permit the administration of inhibitors either of the cell death pathway or of effector target interaction and opens new avenues to neuroprotection approach.

Lapierre et al. [1995, Neuropsychologia 33:139-151] have investigated a more specific hypothesis of orbitofrontal deficits in psychopaths and found that psychopathic criminals are impaired on tasks involving behavioral inhibition and olfactory discrimination, The present study sought to replicate these results with juvenile psychopaths 14 to 18 years of age. As expected, psychopaths were found to be significantly impaired on behavioral inhibition tasks. However, psychopathic and nonpsychopathic inmates performed similarly on measures related to the dorsolateral area of the frontal lobe, Also, no significant intergroup difference was noted on the olfactory discrimination task. Although an orbitofrontal deficit in psychopathy remains possible, it is suggested to explain results through a functional inhibition deficit that is not specifically related to orbitofrontal processing.

The coordinated expression of apoE and its different receptors, the so-called LDL receptor family, appears to regulate the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids during the early and middle phases of the reinnervation in the adult mammalian brain. As neurons undergo dendritic remodelling and synaptogenesis using cholesterol internalization through the apoEALDL receptor pathway, they progressively shut down 3,3-hydroxymethylglutaryi-Coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase activity, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol. These results suggest that cholesterol delivery and synthesis in the brain are tightly regulated through an apoE-dependent mechanism. The discovery that the apolipoprotein e4 allele is strongly linked to both sporadic and familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) has raised the possibility that a dysfunction of lipid transport could explain the poor compensatory synaptogenesis reported by several independent research groups in the brain of AD subjects. Recently, it has been shown that alterations of cholesterol homeostasis in the brain by exogenous administration of dietary cholesterol, or through inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, markedly affect beta amyloid production (1-40 and 1-42) and deposition and significantly impair amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism. In vivo, it has been shown that breeding of APP-overexpressing mice with apoE knockout mice completely abolishes amyloid plaque deposition in the brain of hybrid animals, without affecting beta amyloid steady state levels. Conversely, introduction of the human apoE3 and apoE4 genes in APP-overexpressing mice drastically reduced beta amyloid deposition in the brain of hybrid mice, confirming the proposed biological role of apoE in the clearance of extracellular beta amyloid. These results indicate that lipid homeostasis is controlled in large part by the apoE lipoprotein transport system in the extracellular space, whereas alterations in intracellular lipid homeostasis markedly affect APP processing, beta amyloid production and plaque formation in vivo. The convergence of the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis (Hardy et at., 1992) and of the apoE/lipid recycling cascade model (Poirier, 1994) is consistent with the notion that alterations in lipid homeostasis could serve as the common denominator for apoE and beta amyloid dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease. It is also interesting to note that lipid homeostasis is also a central feature of one of the most important neurotransmitter systems in the brain: the cholinergic system. This system is unique in the CNS since it relies heavily on lipid bioavailability to locally synthesize acetylcholine. It is thus quite tempting to propose that two of the most common neuropathologic landmarks of AD - namely, cholinergic dysfunction and amyloid deposition - may in fact depend on the integrity of local lipid homeostatic processes, Which in turn are strongly dependent upon proper lipid delivery by the apoE transport system.

The motilin receptor has not been cloned yet, but motilin-receptor agonists appear to be potent prokinetic agents for the treatment of dysmotility disorders. The aim of this study was to determine neural or muscular localization of motilin receptors in human upper gastrointestinal tract and to investigate their pharmacological characteristics. The binding of I-125- labeled motilin to tissue membranes prepared from human stomach and duodenum was studied; rabbit tissues were used for comparison. Solutions enriched in neural synaptosomes or in smooth muscle plasma membranes were obtained. Various motilin analogs were used to displace the motilin radioligand from the various tissue membranes. The highest concentration of human motilin receptors was found in the antrum, predominantly in the neural preparation. Human motilin receptors were sensitive to the NH2-terminal portion of the motilin molecule, but comparison with rabbit showed that both species had specific affinities for various motilin analogs [i.e., Mot-(1-9), Mot-(1-12), Mot-(1-12) (CH2NH)(10-11), and erythromycin]. Motilin receptors obtained from synaptosomes or muscular plasma membranes of human antrum expressed different affinity for two motilin-receptor agonists, Mot-(1-12) and Mot-(1-12) (CH2NH)(10-11), suggesting that they correspond to specific receptor subtypes. We conclude that human motilin receptors are located predominantly in nerves of the antral wall, are functionally (and probably structurally) different from those found in other species such as the rabbit, and express specific functional (and probably structural) characteristics dependent on their localization on antral nerves or muscles, suggesting the existence of specific receptor subtypes, potentially of significant physiological or pharmacological relevance.

Due to this fact many developments in constructive neural networks have been concentrated on only constructive or adaptive one-hidden-layer FNNs. However, this fact does not necessarily imply that one-hidden-layer networks are the most efficient and the best network structure feasible, as one has no explicit guideline to properly select the network structure. Consequently, in practice it has been observed that networks with more than one hidden layer may perform better than the one-hidden-layer networks in some applications. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for constructing a multi-hidden-layer FNN with regular connections. The new algorithm incorporates in part the policy for adding (growing) hidden units from a one-hidden-layer constructive algorithm, and has in part its own new policy for additional layer creation. Extensive simulations are performed for nonlinear noisy regression problems, and it is found that the proposed algorithm converges quite fast and produces networks with one or as many hidden layers/units as required, which are dictated by the complexity of the underlying problem.

Functional level adaptation has not received considerable attention, since selecting the activation functions will increase the search space considerably, and a systematic and a rigorous algorithm for accomplishing the search will be required as well. In this paper, we present a new strategy that is applicable to both the fixed structure as well as the constructive network trainings by using different activation functions having hierarchical degrees of nonlinearities, as the constructive learning of a one-hidden-layer feed-forward neural network (FNN) is progressing. Specifically, the orthonormal Hermite polynomials are used as the activation functions of the hidden units, which have certain interesting properties that are beneficial in network training. Simulation results for several noisy regression problems have revealed that our scheme can produce FNNs that generalize much better than one-hidden-layer constructive FNNs with identical sigmoidal activation functions, in particular as applied to rather complicated problems.

The transformation of the low-level internal representation in a neural network into higher-level knowledge or information that can be interpreted more easily by humans and integrated with symbol-oriented mechanisms is the subject of the first group of papers. The second group of papers uses specific applications as starting point, and describes approaches based on neural networks for the knowledge representation required to solve crucial tasks in the respective application. The companion first part of the special issue [1] contains papers dealing with representation and reasoning issues on the basis of neural networks.

However, to our knowledge, association of EDS with another type of cortical cerebral dysplasia, bilateral focal polymicrogyria, has never previously been described. Setting: Two research-oriented hospitals. Patients: We describe 2 patients with EDS and bilateral polymicrogyria. The first, a 29-year-old black man, presented with EDS of unspecified type, seizures, and bilateral frontocentral and frontoposterior polymicrogyria with hypoplasia of the inferior part of the cerebellar vermis. The second, a 20-year-old woman, had type III EDS, seizures and congenital bilateral perisylvian syndrome with polymicrogyria. Conclusions: The association of bilateral focal polymicrogyria and EDS in these 2 patients suggests that extracellular matrix proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of EDS, such as collagen and tenascin, may play an important role in cerebral cortical formation and organization. In a clinical setting, the association of EDS with these cortical structural lesions has implications for diagnosis and management.

That is, certain song types may occur together repeatedly, even on different days. We determined whether clustering of meadowlark songs correlated with repertoire size. We also tested whether clustered songs reflect either their structural similarities, or dissimilarities. Our data were obtained from recordings of free-living individuals of two meadowlark species, eastern, Sturnella magna, and western, S. neglecta. Eastern meadowlarks have approximately 10 times more song types per bird than do westerns. Therefore, if clustering is related to repertoire size, we predicted that there should be (1) proportionately more song clusters in eastern meadowlarks than in westerns, and (2) a similar correlation across individual birds within a species, especially so in easterns, which have a broader range of repertoire sizes. All 14 easterns examined showed clusters whereas only 5 of 11 westerns did so, and the easterns had proportionately more per bird. Many of the same clusters occurred in different recordings of individual easterns. In easterns, the extent of clustering as measured by a PCA analysis correlated strongly with estimated repertoire size. Clustered songs were neither more similar in structure, nor less so, than randomly-paired songs.

However, reward signals from the medial prefrontal cortex do summate with signals from the medial forebrain bundle, suggesting some overlap in the underlying neural circuitry. We have previously used Fos immunohistochemistry to visualize neurons activated by rewarding stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle. In this study, we assessed Fos immunolabeling after self-stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex. Among the structures showing a greater density of labeled neurons in the stimulated hemisphere were the prelimbic and cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens, lateral preoptic area, substantia innominata, lateral hypothalamus, anterior ventral tegmental area, and pontine nuclei. Surprisingly, little or no labeling was seen in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus or the locus coeruleus. Double immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase and Fos showed that within the ventral tegmental area, a substantial proportion of dopaminergic neurons did not express Fos. Despite previous suggestions to the contrary, comparison of the present findings with those of our previous Fos studies reveals a number of structures activated by rewarding stimulation of both the medial prefrontal cortex and the medial forebrain bundle. Some subset of activated cells in the common regions showing Fos-like immunoreactivity may contribute to the rewarding effect produced by stimulating either site. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the present study, adaptive psychophysical procedures were used to determine auditory perceptual thresholds in 14 neurologically normal subjects, and in 31 patients who had undergone surgical resection from either the right or left temporal lobe for the relief of intractable epilepsy. In a subset of the patients, the lesion encroached significantly upon the gyrus of Heschl or its underlying white matter as determined from MRI analysis, Subjects were asked to perform two different perceptual tasks on the same set of stimuli. In a pitch discrimination task, the subject had to decide whether two elements of a pure tone pair were the same or different. In a task requiring the judgement of direction of pitch change, subjects decided whether pitch rose or fell from the first tone fro the second. Thresholds were determined by measuring the minimum pitch difference required for correct task performance; Mean thresholds in the pitch discrimination task did not differ between patient groups and control subjects, In contrast, patients with temporal lobe excisions that encroached upon the gyrus of Heschl in the right hemisphere (but not in the left) showed significantly elevated thresholds when judging the direction of pitch change. These findings support a specialization of function linked to right auditory cortical areas for the processing of pitch direction, and specifically suggest a dissociation between simple sensory discrimination and higher order perception.

Intracerebroventricular administration of [H-3]-chlorisondamine in rats results in an anatomically restricted and persistent intracellular accumulation of radioactivity. The initial aim of the present study was to test whether nicotinic receptor antagonism by chlorisondamine is also anatomically restricted. 2 Male adult rats were pretreated several times with nicotine to avoid the disruptive effects of the drug seen in drug-naive animals. They then received chlorisondamine (10 mu g i.c.v.) or saline, and local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was measured 4 weeks later after acute nicotine (0.4 mg kg(-1) s.c.) or saline administration. During testing, rats were partially immobilized. Nicotine significantly increased LCGU in the anteroventral thalamus and in superior colliculus. Chlorisondamine completely blocked the first of these effects. Chlorisondamine significantly reduced LCGU in the lateral habenula, substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, and cerebellar granular layer. 3 The second experiment was of similar design, but the rats were not pre-exposed to nicotine, and were tested whilst freely-moving. Acute nicotine significantly increased LCGU in anteroventral thalamus, superior colliculus, medial habenula and dorsal lateral geniculate. Overall, however, nicotine significantly decreased LCGU. Most or all of the central effects of nicotine on LCGU were reversed by chlorisondamine given 4 weeks beforehand. 4 These findings suggest that chlorisondamine blocks nicotinic effects widely within the brain. They also indicate that in freely-moving rats, nicotine can reduce or stimulate cerebral glucose utilization, depending on the brain area.

Negative admittance phase in the region above 0.2 Hz suggested operation of an arterial baroreflex. The present study was designed to test this interpretation and to identify the neurotransmitter involved. In rats anesthetized with isoflurane, blood pressure and mesenteric blood flow (transit time ultrasound) were measured with central mechanisms intact, after sinoaortic denervation, and after denervation of the mesenteric bed. Sinoaortic denervation abrogated the negative phase in the band from 0.3 to 0.6 Hz and increased admittance gain in this region. Subsequent mesenteric denervation had no further effect on the pressure-flow transfer function. In a separate experiment, alpha(1)-adrenergic blockade reduced, but did not remove, the negative admittance phase in the 0.2- to 0.5-Hz band without altering admittance gain. It is concluded that the baroreflex acting on the mesenteric circulation can be identified by admittance phase, but that admittance gain is uninformative. Part of the response is mediated by alpha(1)-adrenergic transmission.

Design: Retrospective survey. Participants: 289 players reporting to CFL training camp. Of these, 154 players had played in the CFL during the 1997 season. Main Outcome Measures: Based on self-reported symptoms, calculations were made to determine the number of concussions experienced during the previous season, the duration of symptoms, the time for return to play after concussion, and any associated risk factors for concussions. Results: Of all the athletes who played during the 1997 season, 44.8% experienced symptoms of a concussion. Only 18.8% of these concussed players recognized they had suffered a concussion. 69.6% of all concussed players experienced more than one episode. Symptoms lasted at least 1 day in 25.8% of cases. The odds of experiencing a concussion increased 13% with each game played. A past history of a loss of consciousness while playing football and a recognized concussion while playing football were both associated with increased odds of experiencing a concussion during the 1997 season. Conclusion: Many players experienced a concussion during the 1997 CFL season, but the majority of these players may not have recognized that fact. Players need to be better informed about the symptoms and effects of concussions.

This analysis applies to signals with unique waveform characteristics, such as seizures. Methods: The method extracts activity from an EEG data matrix as a spatiotemporal component having waveforms uncorrelated to the other concurrent activities. The method also provides the location and orientation of the dipole generating this activity. We applied this method to ten scalp seizures in three patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and single-focus seizures confirmed by intracerebral recordings. A realistic head model based on MRI was used for computation of field distributions. Results: When seizure activity was still not visually identifiable on the scalp, the method demonstrated in all scalp seizures a source in the temporal neocortex corresponding clearly to the region of seizure activity in intracerebral recordings. Frequency characteristics of the estimated activities also resembled those of the intracerebral seizures. Conclusions: This method enables estimation of focal brain activity when its effect on scalp EEG is unclear to visual examination. It works in situations where currently available source analyses methods, which require noiseless definite activity, are not applicable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

How far apart in time do two events have to be before they are perceived as sequential? It was this problem in the Greenwich Observatory in 1795 that led to the brst experiments in perceptual thresholds in the 1830s, and the development of psychophysics. Laboratory experiments in this century have yielded contradictory results about the magnitude of temporal offset (or asynchrony) that gives rise to the perception of successiveness, perhaps (we argue) because of the artificial nature of the tasks involved. Accurate successiveness and asynchrony judgments require the human organism to invoke precise neural anticipatory mechanisms, comparative mechanisms, as well as feedback and recursion modules in order to correctly perceive the actual order of events in the real world. Among many problems in modeling the neural apprehension of such anticipations and synchronization judgments is the fat that the time it takes for sensory signals to arrive at the brain is heavily dependent on the sensory modality stimulated. This paper reports data from new experiments in which the authors developed a crossmodal simultaneity task to have greater ecological validity. The results indicate that the threshold for successiveness is smaller than that found in previous experiments, suggesting that people are more accurate at discriminating temporal asynchrony than has been previously thought. The present findings are relevant to theories of time and order perception (1, 2, 3) and consciousness (4, 5).

This study aims to determine if children with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) who required home oxygen therapy were at greater risk for neurological and motor deficits at school age than preterm peers without BPD, This study evaluated 27 subjects with BPD and Br preterm control infants matched for gestational age, birthweight, sex, and year of birth at a mean age of 9.9 years (2.0 SD) using standardized neuromotor outcome measures, Pair-matched comparisons and regression analyses were used to determine if subjects with BPD were at increased risk for neuromotor sequelae, Neurological abnormalities, including subtle neurological signs, cerebral palsy, microcephaly, and behavioral difficulties were highly prevalent in the BPD group (71 % compared with 19 % in control group, P < 0.005). Over half the BPD cohort had difficulties in gross and/or fine motor skills, There were significant differences in postural stability between groups. Duration of hospitalization and home oxygen treatment, and decreased lung function at school age, markers of severity of illness, correlated with motor outcomes. The findings underline the importance of preventing the cardiorespiratory complications associated with chronic lung disease to minimize disability in preterm children. For children with severe BPD, better recognition and subsequent remediation of neuromotor impairments that manifest at school age may help maximize their functional potential.

Furthermore, roles in sperm transport, testicular steroidogenesis, erection, natriuresis, as well as prolactin and ANF release have been proposed. In addition to its classical site of biosynthesis in specific hypothalamic neurons, we have discovered that the uterine epithelium represents a major site of OT gene expression that is highly induced prior to term or by ovarian steroid administration. The multiple biological actions of OT are mediated by a single type of OT receptor (OTR). A remarkable feature of the OTR is the dramatic tissue-specific regulation of its expression. By Northern blot and RT-PCR assays we determined that, during pregnancy, OTR gene expression is increased >25-fold in the uterus and mammary gland and >3-fold in hypothalamic neurons and pituitary lactotrophs. By contrast, OTR expression in several extra-hypothalamic brain regions remains unchanged and renal OTR expression even significantly decreases at the end of pregnancy. Whereas uterine OTR expression undergoes a sharp decrease immediately after delivery, mammary gland OTR expression remains elevated throughout lactation, compatible with a switch in OT's biological target from uterus (pre-delivery) to mammary gland (post-delivery). In addition, whereas uterine OTR gene expression is strongly induced by estrogens, mammary gland OTR expression remains unaffected by ovarian steroids. These findings imply that the OTR gene regulatory mechanisms involve a combinatorial interplay of cell-specific and hormone-responsive transcriptional regulators. Although we were unable to identify an estrogen response element that is functional at its original position within the OTR promoter, we defined a functional AP-1 site within the rat OTR promoter that may be involved in mediating genomic effects of steroids, we found that progesterone is able to decrease OT binding in vitro to membranes containing rat OTR, implying that non-genomic mechanisms may further modulate the biological actions of OT.

To elucidate the mechanisms regulating cell surface availability of the somatostatin (SRIF) receptor subtype sst,, we characterized its internalization properties in transfected COS-7 cells using biochemical, confocal microscopic, and electron microscopic techniques. Our results demonstrated rapid and efficient sequestration of specifically bound [I-125]Tyr(0)-D-Trp(8)-SRIF (up to 45% of bound radioactivity). Combined immunocytochemical detection of sst, and visualization of a fluorescent SRIF analog by confocal microscopy revealed that whereas the internalized ligand progressively clustered toward the cell center with time, immunoreactive receptors remained predominantly associated with the plasma membrane. The preservation of cell surface receptors was confirmed by binding experiments on whole cells revealing a lack of saturability of [I-125]Tyr(0)-D-Trp(8)-SRIF binding at 37 C. Binding was rendered saturable by the drug monensin, showing that receptor recycling played a key role in the preservation of cell surface receptors. Electron microscopy demonstrated that in addition to receptor recycling, internalization of receptor-ligand complexes triggered a massive recruitment of sst, receptor molecules from intracellular stores to the membrane. This combination of recycling and recruitment of spare receptors may protect sst(5) from long term downregulation through sequestration and, therefore, facilitate extended SRIF signaling.

Gravid females were placed in presence and absence of aphids. Fecundity, fertility, dispersion and hatching synchrony were compared. Results indicate a statistical difference in the hatching synchrony of eggs. However, no statistical differences were observed in the proportion of infertile eggs and in egg dispersion. We suggest that C. rufilabris can alter hatching synchrony of eggs in condition of food scarcity in order to favour intra-clutch egg cannibalism by newly hatched larvae and thus increase its overall reproductive success.

Here we studied the role of noradrenaline (NE), one of the main brain neurotransmitters involved in responses to stress, in reinstatement of heroin seeking. We first determined the effect of clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that decreases NE cell firing and release, on stress-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Rats were trained to self-administer heroin (0.1 mg/kg per infusion, IV, three 3-h sessions per day) for 9-10 days. Extinction sessions were given for up to II days during which saline was substituted for the drug. Tests for reinstatement were then conducted after exposure to intermittent footshock (5, 15 and 30 min, 0.5 mA). During testing, clonidine was injected systemically (10-40 mu g/kg, i.p.) or directly into the lateral or fourth ventricles (1-3 mu g) Clonidine (1-2 mu g per site) or its charged analogue, 2-[2,6-diethylphenylamino]-2-imidazole (ST-91, 0.5-1 mu g per site), was also injected bilaterally into the locus coeruleus (LC), the main noradrenergic cell group in the brain. Clonidine blocked stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking when injected systemically or into the cerebral ventricles. In contrast, neither clonidine nor ST-91 consistently altered stress-induced reinstatement when injected into the locus coeruleus. We therefore studied the effect of lesions of the lateral tegmental NE neurons on stress-induced reinstatement. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions performed after training for heroin self-administration had no effect on extinction of heroin-taking behaviour, but significantly attenuated reinstatement induced by intermittent footshock. These data suggest that: (i) clonidine prevents stress-induced relapse to heroin seeking by its action on neurons other than those of the locus coeruleus; and (ii) activation of the lateral tegmental NE neurons contributes to stress-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking.

We investigated the prevalence of PAM during nocturnal sleep and awakenings in 22 RLS patients, Fifteen patients had a PAM index >5 movements per hour during wakefulness and among them only 3 had a PAM index >5 during sleep. Twenty patients had a periodic leg movement (PLM) index >5 during wakefulness and 17 had a PLM index>5 during sleep. In 42.8% of cases, PAM showed temporal relationship with PLM during wakefulness. These results show that PAM is frequent in RLS and suggest that the basic neurological dysfunction responsible for RLS is probably not located exclusively at the level of the lumbar spinal cord but involves neuronal systems located at upper levels.

Broadband noise bursts and simulated moving sounds were delivered from 16 loudspeakers fixed on the horizontal plant in a quasi-anechoic sound-isolation chamber. The activity of 78 neurons was recorded and quantitatively analyzed. Most cells responded to at least the static sound. The relative strengths of their responses suggested that the cells could be classed as omnidirectional (37.2%), contralateral hemifield (29.5%), ipsilateral hemifield (2.5%) and azimuth (7.7%) selective. The remaining 23.1% could not be classified. All cells responded to a simulated moving sound displaced at five different speeds. A majority (88%) of them showed some directional preference in that they discharged at least twice as strongly for one direction as for the other for at least one speed. 14.7% displayed angular speed selectivity. Different patterns of neuronal discharges were evoked. For static sounds, most of the cells gave ON-type responses. A large proportion (60%) of the cells responded in a sustained manner to maintained stimulation. Among these, 68% also gave sustained discharges to moving sounds. The spatial tuning and the directional and angular speed selectivity of neurons in the posterior part of the AEC suggest that this area is involved in the processing of static and moving sounds.

The evoked and spontaneous firing of single CA1 neurons was characterized before and after LTP of the contralateral (commissural) Schaffer collaterals and again after LTP of the ipsilateral (associational) Schaffer collaterals. Individual CA1 neurons displayed either increases or decreases in evoked and spontaneous firing after LTP. As many as five discriminated cells were recorded simultaneously, and they typically responded discordantly, so that after LTP, firing in some neurons increased while in others it decreased. The response of individual neurons to in vivo LTP may be modulated by heterogeneous synaptic changes on individual and local groups of cells, and by changes in feed-forward excitation and inhibition provided by local hippocampal circuitry.

Because no specific behaviors were learned during this procedure, the existence of learned spatial information was inferred from its retarding effect on subsequent conditioned cue preference (CCP) learning on the same maze. Previous experiments have shown that this form of spatial learning, measured in this way, requires an intact fimbria-fornix and functional N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. However, in the present experiments, large neurotoxic lesions of the dorsal hippocampus that impaired win-shift learning failed to eliminate the retarding effect of exploration on CCP learning. This result was obtained in three independent replications. These findings fail to confirm the hypothesis that the hippocampus is involved in spatial learning when that learning occurs in the absence of reinforcers and does not produce any specific learned behaviors. Previous work showed that this form of "pure" spatial learning requires an intact fimbria-fornix for acquisition but not for expression; the present findings suggest that the hippocampus is not required for either of these processes. The fimbria-fornix may interact with other temporal lobe structures in mediating this form of learning. The function of the hippocampus may be limited in some way to situations that involve reinforcers and/or situations in which specific behaviors are learned. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In the present study, changes in glutamate receptors elicited by calcium treatment of previously frozen mouse brain sections were evaluated by qualitative as well as quantitative analysis of tritiated ligand binding to both alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor subtypes. Quantitative analysis revealed that H-3-AMPA binding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by calcium in the cerebral cortex and striatum formations. However, an opposite change in AMPA receptor properties was observed in the hippocampus, as calcium generated an increase of AMPA binding in all hippocampal fields. Analysis of the saturation kinetics of 3H-AMPA binding showed that the calcium-induced augmentation of AMPA binding in the stratum radiatum of the CA, region was due to an alteration in the maximal number of sites, while the reduction of binding elicited by calcium in the cortex appeared to be due to modified AMPA receptor affinity. Calcium-induced downregulation of AMPA receptor affinity in the cortex and striatum was affected by baicalein, a selective inhibitor of the lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism, whereas the same inhibitor did not modify calcium-mediated upregulation of receptor number in the CA, region of the hippocampus. On the other hand, the effect of calcium appeared to be specific for the AMPA receptor, as the same treatment did not affect glutamate binding to the NMDA glutamate receptor subtype. Our results suggest the possibility that, depending on the brain regions, calcium ions may generate opposite modulation of AMPA receptor properties. Because the regulation of AMPA receptors by calcium-dependent enzymes has been implicated in synaptic plasticity, our results suggest that regional variations in the effect of calcium on AMPA binding account for differential plasticity at glutamatergic synapses.

J	Goyette, P; Rozen, R				Goyette, P; Rozen, R			The thermolabile variant 677C -> T can further reduce activity when expressed in CIS with severe mutations for human methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase	HUMAN MUTATION			English	Article						methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTHFR; homocystinuria; folate	CORONARY-ARTERY DISEASE; RISK FACTOR; PLASMA HOMOCYSTEINE; COMMON MUTATION; COLORECTAL-CANCER; VASCULAR-DISEASE; GENE; POLYMORPHISM; DEFICIENCY; IDENTIFICATION	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyses the reduction of 5,10-methylene- tetrahydrofolate to 5 methyltetrahydrofolate, a carbon donor for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. Severe MTHFR deficiency is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. These patients show a wide variety of neurological and vascular symptoms, with variable age of onset. Residual enzyme activity is usually less than 20% of control values, and correlates reasonably well with age of onset of symptoms. A milder deficiency of MTHFR, with 30%-50% residual enzyme activity and increased enzyme thermolability, has been described as a risk factor for vascular disease and for neural tube defects. Tn earlier work, we isolated the human cDNA for MTHFR, and reported 14 mutations in severe MTHFR deficiency, as well as a common 677C-->T missense mutation (Ala-->Val) that encodes the thermolabile MTHFR. This variant has also been observed in some patients with severe MTHFR deficiency in cis with their severe mutations. We report here the in vitro expression of seven severe MTHFR mutations in a bacterial expression system; six of these were expressed in cis with the Val allele to mimic the situation in the patients. We show that three of these constructs have significantly reduced enzyme activity (<10% of control); the presence of the thermolabile variant in these patients in cis is unlikely to affect enzyme function since activity is already low. One mutation causes a dramatic increase in activity when it is expressed in cis with the Ala allele, but is associated with extreme lability when in cis with the Val allele. Three mutations cause moderate decreases in enzyme activity, with. a further decrease in activity when they are in cis with the Val allele, We hypothesize that deleterious mutations which alter stability may be compromised to a greater degree when the thermolabile variant is present on the same allele, Hum Mutat 16:132-138, 2000.

Patients are characterized by severe hyperhomocysteinemia, homocystinuria and a variety of neurological and vascular problems, Eighteen rare mutations have been reported in this group of patients, Two polymorphisms which cause mild enzyme deficiencies have been described (677C-->T and 1298A-->C), The first sequence change encodes a thermolabile enzyme and is associated with mild hyperhomocysteinemia. Six novel point mutations are described in patients with severe deficiency of MTHFR, along with their associated polymorphisms and clinical phenotypes. Of the two nonsense mutations (1762A-->T, 1134C-->G) and four missense mutations (1727C-->T, 1172G-->A, 1768G-->A, and 358G-->A), one was identified in the N-terminal catalytic domain, while the others were located in the regulatory C-terminal region. All four residues affected by missense mutations are conserved in one or more MTHFRs of other species, This report brings the total to 24 mutations identified in severe MTHFR deficiency, with two mutations identified in each of 22 patients, Hum Mutat 15:280-287, 2000, (C) 2000 Wiley Liss, Inc.

Given its ubiquity in human transactions, machine recognition of handwriting has practical significance, as in reading handwritten notes in a PDA, in postal addresses on envelopes, in amounts in bank checks, in handwritten fields in forms, etc. This overview describes the nature of handwritten language, how it is transduced into electronic data, and the basic concepts behind written language recognition algorithms. Bath the on-line case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification, writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered.

In this paper we review some of the approaches which have been proposed to incorporate them into probabilistic models of sequential data, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We also discuss new developments and new ideas in this area, in particular how ANNs can be used to model high-dimensional discrete and continuous data to deal with the curse of dimensionality, and how the ideas proposed in these models could be applied to statistical language modeling to represent longer-term context than allowed by trigram models, while keeping word-order information.

Here we investigate learning architectures in which the kernel functions can be replaced by more general similarity measures that can have arbitrary internal parameters. The training criterion used in SVMs is not appropriate for this purpose so we adopt the simple criterion that is generally used when training neural networks for classification tasks. Several experiments are performed which show that such Neural Support Vector Networks perform similarly to SVMs while requiring significantly fewer support vectors, even when the similarity measure has no internal parameters.

The re-defined output approach is used here by feeding back this output to guarantee the minimum phase behavior of the resulting closed loop system. No a priori knowledge about the nonlinearities of the system is needed where the payload mass is also assumed to be unknown. The weights of the networks are adjusted using a modified on-line error backpropagation algorithm that is based on the propagation of output error, derivative of error and the tip deflection of the manipulator. The real-time controller is implemented on an experimental setup. The results achieved by the proposed neural network (NN) controller are compared experimentally with conventional PD and inverse dynamics controls to substantiate the advantages of our scheme and its promising potentials.

One is based an scaling of the network output error to which output of a hidden unit is expected to maximally correlate. Results from extensive simulations of many regression problems are then summarized to demonstrate that constructive FNNs generalization capabilities may be significantly improved by the new technique. The second contribution is a proposal for a new criterion for input-side weight pruning. This pruning technique removes redundant input-side weights simultaneously with the network constructive scheme, leading to a smaller network with comparable generalization capabilities. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning technique.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						handedness; physiological tremor; laterality; neuromotor activity; manual dominance	MOTOR; PREFERENCE; ASYMMETRY; HAND	The purpose of this study was to quantify with precision the characteristics of normal physiological tremor in the dominant and nondominant hand of a group of right-handed females. Twenty-two right-handed females (aged 20 to 40) gave informed consent to participate. Manual dominance determined with a questionnaire had to be equal to, or above 90%, for subjects to be accepted in the study. While the subjects kept their eyes closed, tremor was recorded simultaneously in the two extended index fingers during 40 s. Preceding the recording of postural tremor there was a period during which the subjects were asked to relax (control condition); to exert a pressure with the two index ringers on two strain gauges (static condition); or to press on and off with both index fingers on two strain gauges (dynamic condition). Each condition was recorded twice with two helium neon velocity lasers. This procedure was repeated after permutation of the lasers, thus a total of twelve sweeps of data were recorded. Seven parameters were used to analyze the tremor signal including measures of harmonicity, median frequency, proportional power in the 7-12 Hz range, amplitude, waveform morphology, entropy, and nonlinearity. Significant differences between hands were found in three parameters (median frequency, power in 7-12 Hz and entropy) but not in tremor amplitude (RMS). In addition, significant differences were found in five out of seven characteristics between conditions. These results suggest that neuromotor activity preceding the recording of tremor has a significant influence on tremor characteristics and that some of these characteristics are significantly different between the right and left hand in right-handed females.

Naturally, the fixed point, fixed word length data format used causes some output differences with respect to floating point computer simulation. These differences are observed when using realistic input data. The effects of input quantization and the accumulation of round off errors in the arithmetic operations making up the algorithm are analyzed. Even a small quantization or round off error can trigger a change in the clustering produced. This does not mean that the clustering is not valid. Indeed, the validity of the clustering can be comparable to that obtained by floating point computer simulation, provided the word length is sufficient. This is verified on realistic input data consisting of radar pulses received from a number of emitters.

In Sol, after 4 wk of paralysis, fibers containing type I MHC were either pure type I (14%) or also contained developmental (D; 76%), IIa (26%), or IIx (18%) MHC. Values for corresponding fibers in dGM were 8.5, 65, 38, and 22%. Also, by 4 wk an increase was seen in the proportions of fibers expressing IIa MHC in Sol (from 16 to 38%) and dGM (from 24 to 74%). In a region of sGM in control muscles containing pure IIb fibers, a major proportion (86%) remained pure after 4 wk of paralysis, with the remainder coexpressing IIb and IIx. The results indicate that TTX-induced muscle paralysis results in an increase in fibers containing multiple MHC isoforms and that the D isoform appears in a major proportion of these hybrid fibers.

During H2 or when slices were kept in 4 mmol/L glucose, AV vanished even more quickly, but the times to block did not differ significantly between slices from controls and mutants. After reoxygenation, AV fully recovered in most slices. Rates of blockade of fEPSPs were comparable in all slices, and most fEPSPs recovered fully after H1. But even in the presence of 10 mmol/L glucose, the second hypoxia suppressed fEPSPs irreversibly in some slices: 2 of 10 from control, 3 of 7 from mdx, and 1 of 6 from mdx(3cv) mice. Most slices in 4 mmol/L glucose showed no recovery at all: six of seven from control, three of five from mdx, and four of five from mdx(3cv) mice. Thus, slices from mdx mice were more susceptible than other slices to irreversible hypoxic failure when slices were kept in 10 mmol/L glucose, but they were less susceptible than other slices when kept in 4 mmol/L glucose. In conclusion, the lack of full-length dystrophin (427 kDa) predisposes to quicker loss of nerve conduction in slices from mdx and mdx(3cv) mutants and improved posthypoxic recovery of fEPSPs in 4 mmol/L glucose in slices from mdx but not mdx(3cv) mutants, perhaps because the 70-kDa and other C-terminal isoforms are still present in mdx mice.

Patient MV was observed for two years from the age of 5 years and 6 months. Initially, this young patient exhibited unintelligible and atypical speech production (multiword utterances without consonants), delay in balance and coordination, and impairments in rhythmic tasks; but she was otherwise developing normally with no intellectual impairment or behavioral disorder. MRI scans showed moderately enlarged ventricles, a thin, incompletely myelinated corpus callosum and intact basal ganglia. Two years later, MV's performance was nearly normal only in comprehension aspects of language. In contrast, production aspects of language and speech and neuromotor development showed very little improvement after two years. These observations first suggest that development of receptive and expressive domains within language may be asynchronous, and that the progression of motor control of language appears to follow a parallel course to neuromotor development.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we studied the organisation of the visual cortex in a patient with callosal agenesis and colpocephaly, whose visual acuity and binocular visual fields were normal. The stimulus used was a moving grating confined to one hemifield, on a background of moving dots. In addition to activation patterns elicited by stimulation of each hemifield in the patient, the activation pattern was compared to that seen in six normal volunteers, fMRI demonstrated large scale reorganisation of visual cortical areas in the left hemisphere, and fewer activation fool were observed in both occipital robes when compared with normal subjects.

This functional shape is obtained when the option pricing function is homogeneous of degree one with respect to the underlying asset price (S-t) and the strike price (K). We show that pricing accuracy gains can be made by exploiting this generalized Black-Scholes shape. Instead of setting up a learning network mapping the ratio S-t/K and the time to maturity ( tau) directly into the derivative price, we break down the pricing function into two parts, one controlled by the ratio S-t/K, the other one by a function of time to maturity. The results indicate that the homogeneity hint always reduces the out-of-sample mean squared prediction error compared with a feedforward neural network with no hint. Both feedforward network models, with and without the hint, provide similar delta-hedging errors that are small relative to the hedging performance of the Black-Scholes model. However, the model with hint produces a more stable hedging performance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

Precipitating factors are common and include an oral protein load, gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of sedatives. HE is common following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunts (TIPS), Neuropathologically, HE in cirrhotic patients is characterized by astrocytic (rather than neuronal) changes known as Alzheimer type II astrocytosis and in altered expression of key astrocytic proteins. Magnetic resonance imaging in cirrhotic patients reveals bilateral signal hyperintensities particularly in globus pallidus on T-1-weighted imaging, a phenomenon which may result from manganese deposition. Proton (H-1) magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows increases in the glutamine resonance in brain, a finding which confirms previous biochemical studies and results no doubt from increased brain ammonia removal (glutamine synthesis). Additional evidence for increased brain ammonia uptake and removal in cirrhotic patients is provided by studies using positron emission tomography and (NH3)-N-13, Recent molecular biological studies demonstrate increased expression of genes coding for neurotransmitter-related proteins in chronic liver failure. Such genes include monoamine oxidase (MAO-A isoform), the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and nitric oxide synthase (nNOS isoform), Activation of these systems has the potential to lead to alterations of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter function as well as modified cerebral perfusion in chronic liver failure. Prevention and treatment of HE in cirrhotic patients continues to rely on ammonia-lowering strategies which include assessment of dietary protein intake and the use of lactulose, neomycin, sodium benzoate and L-ornithine-aspartate, The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil may be effective in certain cases. A more widespread use of central nervous system-acting drugs awaits a more complete understanding of the precise neurotransmitter systems involved in the pathogenesis of HE in chronic liver failure.

Using homology modeling, the structure of human lysosomal neuraminidase was constructed and the structural changes caused by these missense mutations were deduced. The predicted change due to V217M was smaller than that caused by G243R, the latter resulting in a drastic, widespread alteration. The overexpressed gene products containing these mutations had the same molecular weight as that of the wild type, although the amounts of the products were moderately decreased. A biochemical study demonstrated that the expressed neuraminidase containing a V217M mutation was partly transported to lysosomes and showed residual enzyme activity, although a G243R mutant was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi area and had completely lost the enzyme activity. Considering the data, we surmise that the V217M substitution may be closely associated with the phenotype of sialidosis type 1 with a late onset and moderate clinical course.

The proposed approach is based on quasi-linear dynamic models of the plant. Classical optimal controllers for each set of operating conditions were developed. These controllers are used to construct a single fuzzy-logic gain scheduling-like controller. Adaptive-neuro-fuzzy inference system was used to construct the rules for the fuzzy gain schedule. This will guarantee the continuos change in the gains as the system parameters change in time or space. This procedure is systematic and can be used to design controllers for many nonlinear systems. Two degrees of freedom (dof) planar manipulator was chosen to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A robot manipulator is inherently unstable and displays a strong nonlinearity. The resulting system is stable for different reference trajectories. The system is also robust for wide range of driving frequencies of the input. This system is able to deal with slow as well as fast varying systems, which is a significant improvement on conventional gain scheduling.

The selectivity of this injury could be conferred either by the properties of the effecters or the targets. The former would involve antigen specific recognition by either antibody or T cell receptor of the adaptive immune system. OLs are also susceptible to non antigen restricted injury mediated by components of the innate immune system including macrophages/microglia and NK cells. Target related selectivity could reflect the expression of death inducing surface receptors (such as Fas or TNFR-1) required for interaction with effector mediators and subsequent intracellular signaling pathways, including the caspase cascade. Development of therapeutic delivery systems, which would reach the site of disease activity within the CNS, will permit the administration of inhibitors either of the cell death pathway or of effector target interaction and opens new avenues to neuroprotection approach.

In myoblasts differentiating in culture the molecular mass of alpha-DG is not significantly increased by their replication, fusion, or differentiation into myotubes. Monoclonal antibody IIH6, which recognizes a carbohydrate epitope on alpha-DG, preferentially binds to the larger forms, suggesting that the core protein is differentially glycosylated beginning at E16. Consistent with prior observations implicating the IIH6 epitope in laminin binding, the smaller forms of alpha-DG bind more weakly to laminin affinity columns than the larger ones. In blots of adult rat skeletal muscle probed with radiolabeled laminin or monoclonal antibody IIH6, alpha-DG appears as a >200-kDa band that decreases in molecular mass but increases in intensity following denervation, Northern blots reveal a single mRNA transcript, indicating that the reduction in molecular mass of alpha-DG after denervation is not obviously a result of alternative splicing but is likely due to posttranslational modification of newly synthesized molecules. The regulation of alpha-DG by the nerve and its increased affinity for laminin suggest that glycosylation of this protein may be important in myofiber-basement membrane interactions during development and after denervation.

Thus, postnatal handling dampens HPA responsivity to stress, while prolonged periods of maternal separation have the opposite effect. HPA responses to stress are initiated by the release of corticotropin-releasing factor and/or arginine vasopressin from the neurones of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNh). A major source of input to the PVNh arises from brainstem noradrenergic neurones with signalling occurring via alpha(1) adrenoreceptors. We examined the noradrenergic response to stress in the PVNh in adult animals exposed to daily periods of handling or maternal separation over the first 2 weeks of life using microdialysis in conscious animals. Maternal separation increased, while handling greatly decreased and norepinepherine responses to restraint stress in the PVNh as compared to non-handled controls; the same pattern was observed for plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) responses to stress. Rearing condition did not affect either alpha(1) or alpha(2) receptor levels in the PVNh. However, alpha(2) receptor binding levels in the noradrenergic cell body regions of the locus coeruleus and the n. tractus solitarius were significantly increased in handled animals. These alpha(2) receptors are principally located on noradrenergic neurones (i.e. autoreceptors) and inhibit noradrenaline release at terminal sites. The effects on alpha(2) receptor levels could serve as a mechanism for the differences in stress-induced noradrenaline levels in the PVNh and in HPA activity among handled vs non-handled and maternal separation animals.

To investigate its mechanism, we examined 2-DG's effect in CA1 neurons recorded with sharp 3 M KCI electrodes containing a strong chelator, 50 or 100 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). In most cases, field EPSPs were simultaneously recorded and conventional LTP was also elicited in some cells by tetanic stimulation of stratum radiatum. 2-DG potentiated intracellular EPSP slopes by 48 +/-: 5.1% (SE) in nine cells recorded with plain KCI electrodes and by 52 +/- 6.2% in seven cells recorded with EGTA-containing electrodes. In four of the latter cells, tetanic stimulation (twice 100 Hz for 1 s) failed to evoke LTP (2 +/- 1.1%), although field EPSPs were clearly potentiated (by 28 +/- 6.9%). Thus unlike tetanic LTP, 2-DG LTP is not readily prevented by postsynaptic intraneuronal injection of EGTA. These findings agree with other evidence that the rise in postsynaptic (somatic) [Ca2+](i) caused by 2-DG is not the principal trigger for the subsequent 2-DG LTP and that it may be a purely presynaptic phenomenon.

In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and blockers of inhibitory receptors (strychnine and picrotoxin), we detected fast glutamatergic mEPSCs that were blocked by the AMPA/kainate receptor-selective antagonist 6-cyano-7-ninoquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). At positive voltages or in the absence of Mg2+, a second, slower component of the mEPCs was revealed that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-selective antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP-5) abolished. In the presence of both CNQX and AP-5, all mEPSCs were eliminated. The NMDA component of reticulospinal mEPSCs had a large single-channel conductance estimated to be 48 pS. Larval AMPA/kainate and NMDA components of the mEPSCs decayed with biexponential time courses that changed little during development. At all stages examined, approximately one-half of synapses had only NMDA responses (lacking AMPA/kainate receptors), whereas the remainder of the synapses were composed of a mixture of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors. There was an overall increase in the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs with an NMDA component in reticulospinal (but not motoneurons) during development. These results indicate that glutamate is a prominent excitatory transmitter in the locomotor regions of the developing zebrafish and that it activates either NMDA receptors alone at functionally silent synapses or together with AMPA/kainate receptors.

Prior studies have shown that BNs carry eye movement-related signals during saccades and carry head as well as eye movement-related signals during gaze shifts. Therefore MNs receive signals related to head motion during gaze shifts, yet they solely drive eye motion. Here we addressed whether the relationship between MN tiring rates and eye movements is influenced by the additional premotor signals present during gaze shifts. Neurons in the abducens nucleus of monkeys were first studied during saccades made with the head stationary. We then recorded from the same neurons during voluntary combined eye-head gaze shifts. We conclude that the activity of MNs, in contrast to that of BNs, is related to eye motion by the same dynamic relationship during head-restrained saccades and head-unrestrained gaze shifts. In addition, we show that a standard metric-based analysis [i.e., counting the number of spikes (NOS) in a burst] yields misleading results when applied to the same data set. We argue that this latter approach fails because it does not properly consider the system's dynamics or the strong interactions between eye and head motion.

RECEPTOR CHANNELS; FROG-MUSCLE; ION CHANNELS; PATCH-CLAMP; TIME-COURSE; CURRENTS; MOTONEURONS; ACTIVATION; ENDPLATE; CELLS	At larval zebrafish neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), miniature end plate currents (mEPCs) recorded in vivo have an unusually fast time course. We used fast-flow application of acetylcholine (ACh) onto outside-out patches to mimic the effect of synaptic release onto small numbers of ACh receptor channels (AChRs). Positively charged ACh acted at hyperpolarized potentials and at millimolar concentrations as a fast ("flickering") open channel blocker of AChRs. Because of filtering, the open channel block resulted in reduced amplitude of single channel currents. Immediately after brief (1 msec) application (without significant desensitization) of millimolar ACh at hyperpolarized potentials, a slower, transient current appeared because of delayed reversal of the block. This rebound current depended on the ACh concentration and resembled in time course the mEPC. A simple kinetic model of the AChR that includes an open channel-blocking step accounted for our single channel results, as well as the experimentally observed slowing of the time course of mEPCs recorded at a hyperpolarized compared with a depolarized potential. Recovery from AChR block is a novel mechanism of synaptic transmission that may contribute in part at all NMJs.

Although epidermal growth factor (EGF) elicits many of the same early biochemical and molecular changes in PC12 cells observed in response to NGF, EGF does not induce molecular or morphological differentiation of PC12 cells. The identification of genes whose expression is differentially regulated by NGF versus EGF in PC12 cells has, therefore, been considered a source of potential insight into the molecular specificity of neurotrophin-driven neuronal differentiation. A "second generation" representational difference analysis procedure now identifies the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (UPAR) as a gene that is much more extensively induced by NGF than by EGF in PC12 cells. Both an antisense oligonucleotide for the UPAR mRNA and an antibody directed against UPAR protein block NGF-induced morphological and biochemical differentiation of PC12 cells; NGF-induced UPAR expression is required for subsequent NGF-driven differentiation.

However, few neural networks have been identified in which the production, transport, and effects of BDNF on postsynaptic neurons can be analyzed in detail. In this study, we have identified such a network. BDNF has been colocalized by immunocytochemistry with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in nerve fibers and nerve terminals within the lateral septum of rats. BDNF-containing nerve fibers terminate on a population of calbindin-containing neurons in lateral septum that contain TrkB, the high-affinity receptor for BDNF. Overexpression of BDNF in noradrenergic neurons increased levels of calbindin in septum, as well as in whole-brain lysates. Septal levels of calbindin and BDNF partially decreased after unilateral lesions of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), induced with 6-hydroxydopamine, a treatment that abolished TH staining. These data suggest that BDNF is anterogradely transported within the MFB in catecholaminergic neurons arising from brainstem nuclei. To determine whether BDNF affects the production of calbindin in lateral septal neurons directly, we tested the effects of BDNF on cultures of septal neurons from embryonic day 16-17 rats. BDNF promoted the expression of calbindin, as well as the arborization of calbindin-containing neurons, but BDNF had no effect on cell division or survival. Together, these results suggest that BDNF, anterogradely transported in catecholaminergic neurons, regulates calbindin expression within the lateral septum.

Both the rate and pattern of myelin disappearance from the optic nerve and tract were determined using immunohistochemistry on frozen sections, as well as plastic sections and electron microscopy. Animals with and without regenerating optic axons were examined in order to determine whether the axons play a role in myelin clearance. We found that myelin is cleared at different rates along the visual paths. Thus, virtually all myelin debris is gone in the optic tract and distal optic nerve stump by 4 weeks after surgery, while in the cranial nerve segment, myelin clearance is still incomplete at 6 weeks postoperative. These temporal and spatial patterns of myelin clearance are the same in animals with and without regenerating axons, thus indicating that growing axons do not influence this process. Finally, ultrastructural observations revealed that both astrocytes and microglia participate in phagocytosing myelin debris in the optic nerve, while in the tract, the vast majority of debris is removed by microglia alone. These data are discussed with regard to possible mechanisms controlling the differential expression of myelin clearance. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Removal or disconnection of an entire cerebral hemisphere is occasionally used to treat refractory seizures. Patients who have undergone a hemispherectomy provide useful models to study the reorganization of cortical somatosensory representation. This plasticity may be a consequence of the pathological lesion: the hemispherectomy itself, or both. Methods. Three patients who had undergone hemispherectomy were studied with functional magnetic resonance (fMR) imaging. Responses to sensory stimulation in normal hands and hands opposite the lesioned hemisphere were studied. Multislice T-2*-weighted gradient-echo echoplanar images were obtained using a 1.5-tesla MR imager. The activation condition consisted of somatosensory stimulation of the index finger. A T-1-weighted anatomical MR image was acquired. The fMR and anatomical MR images were coregistered, and statistically significant activation foci (p < 0.01) were identified. Stimulation of the normal hand produced activation in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in all patients. Stimulation of the impaired hand resulted in activation of the ipsilateral parietal operculum (second somatosensory area [SII]) and posterior parietal lobe (Brodmann's Area 7) in all cases, but no activation was elicited in the SI in any patient. In addition, other areas within the ipsilateral frontal and parietal lobes were activated in some individuals. Conclusions. Residual somatosensory function in the hand opposite the lesioned hemisphere is mediated by the SII and other cortical regions in the intact hemisphere, without involvement of the SI.

The hippocampus plays a crucial rule in the behavioral manifestations of the syndrome as it is richest in glucocorticoid receptors and is thus particularly vulnerable to glucocorticoid excess. The wide distribution of glucocorticoid receptors throughout the cerebral cortex, however, suggests that several cognitive functions can also be affected by the dysregulation of glucocorticoids. In this study, we investigated how an excess of glucocorticoid hormones affects cognitive processes. Nineteen patients with chronic hypercortisolemia due to CS were compared to healthy controls matched for age, sex, education, and occupation in tests of processing of visual and spatial information, memory, reasoning and concept formation, language and verbal functions, and attention. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed overall differences in tests of treatment of visual and spatial information, reasoning and concept formation as well as in verbal and language performance, with poorer performance from CS patients. Differences were also observed in nonverbal aspects of memory and in attention tasks. The results suggest that chronic exposure to elevated levels of cortisol is associated with deficits in several areas of cognition, particularly those involving processing of selective attention and visual components. This study also shows that hormones play an important role in the modulation of cognitive function and that their influence on cerebral structure and function merits closer scrutiny.

Fifty-two AD patients (26 men, 23 estrogen non-using women and three estrogen-using women), mean age 76.2 years, were recruited and assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), a test of mood, and a radioimmunoassay measure of E-2 levels at the time of testing. The AD patients were compared to a control group of age and gender-matched healthy elderly men and women estrogen-users and non-users. No differences were found between the AD patients and the controls in overall E-2 levels, but, as expected, the women estrogen-users in both the AD and control groups had higher E-2 levels than the men and the female estrogen non-users. Both groups of men had higher E-2 levels than the estrogen non-using women. There was a significant negative correlation between E-2 levels and GDS scores in the full sample, which was particularly strong in the estrogen-using women. This indicates that those subjects with higher E-2 levels had less mood symptomatology. Overall, mood scores in the AD patients were higher than in the healthy controls, indicating higher levels of depressive symptomatology; the highest depression scores occurred in the AD women who were estrogen non-users. This suggests that depressive symptoms are common in AD patients, and that women with AD who are not taking estrogen replacement may be especially vulnerable to depression.

This modularity of linguistic competence can be observed in aphasics, who may lose the procedural morpho-syntactic component of their primary language while preserving the declarative, lexical-semantic component (Wernicke's aphasia), or may show complementary deficits (Broca's aphasia). Theoretically, however, the morpho-syntactic component of a secondary language may be primarily supported by explicit, rather than implicit systems, if the L2 morpho-syntax has been learnt in an explicit manner. Evidence from brain-imaging studies of bilinguals and from unusual patterns of recovery in bilingual aphasics suggest that secondary languages studied in a formal, scholastic setting show greater dependence than the LI on explicit memory systems.

In the vast majority of right-handed individuals, these areas include portions of the left hemisphere surrounding the Sylvian fissure, particularly the posterior inferior frontal lobe and the posterior temporal lobe. In the case of bilinguals, the question which naturally arises is that of how separate languages are anatomically stored in the brain. There are 3 basic hypotheses: 1) L1 and L2 are represented in the same cortical substrates; 2) L1 and 1,2 are represented in distinct cortical areas; and 3) LI and L2 are represented in different but overlapping areas'. Any attempt to answer this question should address two separate but related issues: 1) How are words in different languages represented in the bilingual brain?; and 2) How are the implicit grammatical rules underlying linguistic competence represented in the bilingual brain! This paper will address the first of these issues, namely the cortical representation of words in the bilingual brain.

As a result of the craniotomy, the accuracy of stereotactic localization techniques is reduced unless the brain shift can be accurately measured. If an ultrasound probe is tracked by a 3D optical tracking system, intraoperative ultrasound images acquired through the craniotomy can be compared to pre-operative MRI images to quantify the shift. We have developed 2D and 3D image overlay tools which allow interactive, realtime visualization of the shift as well as software that uses homologous landmarks between the ultrasound and MRI image volumes to create a thin-plat e-spline warp transformation that provides a mapping between pre-operative imaging coordinates and the shifted intra-operative coordinages. Our techniques have been demonstrated on poly vinyl alcohol cryogel phantoms which exhibit mechanical and imaging properties similar to those of the human brain.

Nevertheless, due to the imaging process, SPECT images are blurred and consequently their interpretation by the clinician is often difficult. In order to improve the spatial resolution of these images and then to facilitate their interpretation, we propose herein to implement a deconvolution procedure relying on an accurate distribution mixture parameter estimation procedure. Parameters of this distribution mixture are efficiently exploited in order to prevent overfitting of the noisy data or to determine the support of the object to be deconvolved when this one is needed. In this context, we compare the deconvolution results obtained by the Lucy-Richardson(1) method and by the recent blind deconvolution technique called the NAS-RIF algorithm(2) on real and simulated brain SPECT images. The NAS-RIF performs the best and shows significant contrast enhancement with little mottle (noise) amplification.

The cell lines express a unique, low-threshold, transient type of Ca-2+ current that is not affected by L-type Ca-2+ channel blocker (PN 200-110), N-type Ca2+ channel blocker (omega-conotoxin GVIA) or P-type Ca2+ channel blocker (Agatoxin IVA) but is blocked by either Cd2+ or Ni2+. This pharmacological profile most closely resembles that of T-type Ca2+ channels [1-3]. Exposure to androgen had no effect on control cell lines or cells transfected with normal AR but significantly changed the steady-state activation in cells transfected with expanded AR. The observed negative shift in steady-state activation results in a large increase in the T-type Ca2+ channel window current. We suggest that Ca2+ overload due to abnormal voltage-dependence of transient Ca2+ channel activation may contribute to motor neuron toxicity in spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). This hypothesis is supported by the additional finding that, at concentrations that selectively block T-type Ca2+ channel currents, Ni2+ significantly reduced cell death in cell lines transfected with polyGln-expanded AR.

J	Jackson, MF; Esplin, B; Capek, R				Jackson, MF; Esplin, B; Capek, R			Reversal of the activity-dependent suppression of GABA-mediated inhibition in hippocampal slices from gamma-vinyl GABA (vigabatrin)-pretreated rats	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						GABA; anticonvulsant; vigabatrin; inhibition; paired-pulse; IPSPs	ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; ACETYLENIC GABA; TRANSAMINASE INHIBITORS; CORTICAL SYNAPTOSOMES; AMINOBUTYRIC ACID; VIGABATRIN; RELEASE; SEIZURE; BRAIN; CA1	The antiepileptic drug, gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG, vigabatrin), is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-transaminase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of GABA. In hippocampal slices prepared from rats pretreated with either an anticonvulsant dose of GVG (1500 mg/kg) or saline, electrophysiological recordings were performed in order to examine the effects of GVG pretreatment on GABAergic neurotransmission. Although GVG had no effect on the effectiveness of GABA-mediated inhibition when elicited by a single stimulus, it reversed the activity-dependent depression of inhibition which is typically observed when inhibitory pathways are activated repetitively by a train of stimuli delivered at low frequency. Similarly, GVG pretreatment prevented the progressive decline in the amplitude of monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) during low-frequency stimulation of inhibitory interneurons. Thus, in slices from GVG pretreated rats, the amplitudes of both the fast and slow components of the last of a series of IPSPs evoked by a 5 Hz, 4 s train were maintained at 91.5 +/- 6.6% and 87.7 +/- 6.5%, respectively, compared to 61.1 +/- 3.9% and 57.1 +/- 5.0% in control slices. Finally, in slices from GVG pretreated rats, we observed a reduction in the ability of the GABA, receptor agonist, baclofen, to decrease the amplitude of monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that GVG may produce its frequency-dependent actions by reducing the function of release regulating presynaptic GABA(B), autoreceptors. The frequency-dependent reinforcement of inhibition by GVG may importantly contribute to the anticonvulsant effectiveness of this compound. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nicotine increased 5-HT release from striatal synaptosomes (maximally by 15-30%) but not from cerebral cortex or hippocampal synaptosomes. Release of striatal 5-HT was increased in a concentration-dependent manner by nicotine, epibatidine, cytisine, and ACh (with added esterase inhibitor and muscarinic antagonist). Respective EC50 values were: 0.5, 0.003, 0.1 and 0.7 mu M. The maximal effect of each agonist was virtually completely blocked by a high concentration of the insurmountable nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine; at a higher concentration of epibatidine (3 mu M), a mecamylamine-insensitive effect was revealed. Nicotine, ACh and epibatidine appeared equally efficacious, whereas cytisine was of lower efficacy (60-70% of ACh). Release evoked by a half-maximal concentration of nicotine was inhibited by the nicotinic antagonists dihydro-beta-erythroidine (IC50 0.04 mu M) and methyllycaconitine (IC50 0.06 mu M). Nicotine-evoked 5-HT release was not reduced by tetrodotoxin given in a concentration that blocked veratridine-evoked release. These findings provide functional evidence for a direct action of nicotine on 5-HT neurons in the brain. The presynaptic nAChRs that modulate striatal 5-HT release appear to possess a novel pharmacological profile. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Binding studies have suggested that clozapine also antagonises GABA(A) receptors, but physiological evidence for such a block at functional synapses is lacking. In this study, we explored this antagonism by using electrophysiological techniques on GABAergic neurones of the ventral tegmental area in culture. Inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked in isolated GABAergic neurones were found to be dose-dependently inhibited by clozapine. Compatible with a post-synaptic mechanism, we found that membrane currents evoked by exogenous applications of GABA were similarly dose-dependently inhibited by clozapine. An analysis of miniature inhibitory pest-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) showed that clozapine reduced the amplitude of quantal events in a way similar to SR-95531, a specific GABA(A) receptor antagonist. Both drugs caused a similar leftward shift of the cumulative probability distribution of mIPSC amplitudes. This suggests that clozapine acts on both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that clozapine produces a functional antagonism of GABA(A) receptors at synapses. Because this effect occurs at concentrations that could be found in the brain of patients treated with clozapine, a reduction in GABAergic synaptic transmission could be implicated in the therapeutic actions and/or side-effects of clozapine.

The RT50 values for 5-HT were increased by both 10 and 40 mg/kg/day regimens of venlafaxine, whereas those for NE were increased only by the 40 mg/kg/day regimen, indicative of a greater potency of venlafaxine in blocking 5-HT reuptake. The sensitivity of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors was altered by neither regimen of venlafaxine. Using a paradigm by which the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 can induce a dishinbition of firing activity of CA(3) pyramidal neurons, it was demonstrated that the high, but not the low, dose of venlafaxine led to an enhanced tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal hippocampus. The duration of the suppressant effect of the firing activity of CA(3) hippocampus pyramidal neurons produced by the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway was significantly reduced when the frequency of the stimulation was enhanced from 1 Hz to 5 Hz in control rats and in rats treated with 10 mg/kg/day, but not with 40 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine. Hence, venlafaxine induced a desensitization of the terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptor only at the high dose. A 2-day treatment with 10 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine induced a suppression of the firing activity of 5-HT neurons of the dorsal raphe. The firing activity of these neurons was back to control level in rats that had been treated for 21 days with the same dose of venlafaxine. The suppressant effect of the i.v. administration of the 5-HT autoreceptor agonist LSD on the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was reduced in rats that had been treated for 21 days with 10 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine. A 2-day treatment with 40 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine, unlike the 10 mg/kg/day regimen, induced a marked suppression of the firing activity of locus coeruleus NE neurons. However, in contrast to 5-HT neurons, NE neurons did not recover their firing activity after a 21-day treatment. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that the low dose of venlafaxine blocked selectively the reuptake of 5-HT, whereas the high dose blocked the reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. Moreover, an enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission by venlafaxine was only achieved under conditions whereby the desensitization of the terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptor is appended to that of the somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptor.

The high, but not the low, dose regimen of venlafaxine enhanced the electrically-evoked release of [H-3]5-HT while treatment with the high dose of venlafaxine failed to alter the electrically-evoked release of [H-3]NE. The inhibitory effect of the 5-HT1B agonist CP 93,129 on the electrically evoked release of [H-3]5-HT was unaltered by the low dose regimen of venlafaxine;while it was attenuated in rats treated with the high dose of venlafaxine, indicative of a functional desensitization of the terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptor. Unexpectedly, neither regimen of venlafaxine altered the inhibitory effect of UK 14,304 on the electrically evoked release of both [H-3]5-HT and [H-3]NE, indicating that neither the alpha(2)-adrenergic auto- nor heteroreceptors were desensitized. Finally, the functions of the 5-HT and NE reuptake process were assessed. None of the treatment regimens altered the basal uptake of [H-3]5-HT from hippocampal or mesencephalic slices nor that of [H-3]NE from hippocampal slices. Finally, the enhancing effect of 1 mu M of paroxetine in the perfusion medium on the electrical release of [H-3]5-HT was unaltered in hippocampal slices prepared from rats that had been treated for 21 days with 40 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine. Taken together, these results indicate that, in terms of alteration of the sensitivity of the terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptor, alpha(2)-adrenergic auto-and heteroreceptors, the effects of long-term administration of venlafaxine are no different than those observed with classical SSRI's.

J	Rompre, PP; Perron, S				Rompre, PP; Perron, S			Evidence for a role of endogenous neurotensin in the initiation of amphetamine sensitization	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						amphetamine; locomotion; neurotensin; sensitization; SR-48692	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; H-3 DOPAMINE RELEASE; RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; IN-VITRO; RAT; NEURONS; ANTAGONIST; SR-48692	This study was aimed at testing the hypothesis that endogenous neurotensin plays a role in the initiation of sensitization to the locomotor activating effect of amphetamine. During an initial training phase, different groups of male rats were injected on four occasions (every second day: Days 1, 3, 5 and 7) with one of three doses (40, 80 or 160 mu g/kg, ip) of the neurotensin antagonist, SR-48692, or its vehicle, followed 30 min later by amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg,, ip), or saline. Ambulatory, non-ambulatory, and vertical movements were measured for 2 h in photocell cages immediately following the second injection. One week after the training phase, sensitivity to amphetamine (0.75 mg/kg, ip) was tested in all the rats (sensitization test). The results show that SR-48692, when given alone, produced levels of locomotor activity that were not statistically different from control. At the low dose, it potentiated amphetamine-induced ambulatory and non-ambulatory movements, an effect observed on Day 7 but not on Day 1. On the day of the sensitization test, rats pre-exposed to amphetamine alone displayed stronger ambulatory and non-ambulatory movements than vehicle pre-exposed rats, a sensitization effect that was attenuated and prevented by SR-48692 at 80 and 160 mu g/kg, respectively. The present results demonstrate that activation of neurotensin receptors by endogenous neurotensin is required for the initiation of amphetamine sensitization. They provide additional evidence that an increase in central neurotensinergic neurotransmission may lead to a lasting increased sensitivity to psychostimulant drugs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Subjects produced simple reaction times (RTs) to visual targets shown to the left or right visual hemifield. Preceding the target by an interval of 500 ms, arrow cues predicting the target location were shown left and right of the point of ocular fixation. For a majority of total and anterior callosotomy patients, results with valid focused cues (both arrows pointing to the target location) and with divided-attention cues (arrows pointing away from fixation) did not differ and both conditions produced shorter RTs than with neutral cues (equal signs). In contrast, neurologically intact subjects showed equal RTs with divided-attention and neutral cues, whereas valid focused cues produced reduced RTs relative to neutral cues. These results indicate that most split-brains, in contrast to normal observers, are capable of directing their attention to left and right visual field locations simultaneously, and therefore that each cerebral hemisphere controls its own visuo-spatial attention mechanism.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of experimentally reducing catecholamine neurotransmission by means of acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion (APTD). healthy female volunteers ingested: (1) a nutritionally balanced amino acid (AA) mixture (n = 14); (2) a mixture deficient in the serotonin precursor, tryptophan (n = 15); or (3) one deficient in the catecholamine precursors, phenylalanine and tyrosine (n = 12). Mood was measured at three times: at baseline and both immediately before and after an aversive psychological challenge (public speaking and mental arithmetic) conducted 5 hours after AA mixture ingestion. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) lowered mood and energy and increased irritability scores. These effects were statistically significant only after the psychological challenge. The effect of APTD on mood was similar to that of ATD. APTD did not attenuate the anxiety caused by the psychological challenge. These findings suggest that, in healthy women, reduced serotonin and/or catecholamine neurotransmission increases vulnerability to lowered mood, especially following exposure to aversive psychological events.

Thus, the sensitized locomotor response to a challenge injection of amphetamine is greater if the drug is given in the environment previously associated with intermittent injections than if given in a different environmental contest. 2,13,16,18,20,21 Contrary to the wealth of information on the significance of contextual cues, little is known about the importance of time cues in the expression of sensitized responding to amphetamine. Ln the present study me, therefore, asked whether time of injection might influence the expression of amphetamine sensitization. We found that time can readily act as a conditioned stimulus to control the expression of behavioral sensitization to amphetamine in rats. This finding is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying sensitization to psychostimulant drugs and its impact on behavior. (C) 2000 IBRO, Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

In aged Long-Evans rats, emergence of functional deficits has been related to the increase in the alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subtype in most hippocampal subfields, not observed in other brain structures. As AMPA receptors expressed in astrocytes may participate in the delayed and long-term glial response to injury, we investigated whether astrocytes participate in the increase of AMPA receptor observed in these aged rats. To this end, distribution of monoamine oxidase B, used as an astroglial marker, was characterized by quantitative autoradiography in the hippocampus and septum of young adults (six months) and aged (24-25 months) rats using [H-3]lazabemide. Specific binding to brain sections of young, aged unimpaired, and aged impaired animals were calculated densitometrically, Compared to young animals, all hippocampal subfields in the aged unimpaired group showed a significant age-related increased labeling, which was not present in the aged impaired group. This contrasts with the increased glial transcription described in this last group. We propose that increase in AMPA receptors in the aged memory-impaired animals may be related to an atypic astrocytic reactivity. (C) 2000 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Li, H; Henry, JL				Li, H; Henry, JL			Adenosine receptor blockade reveals N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor- and voltage-sensitive dendritic spikes in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in vitro	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						endogenous adenosine; synchronized giant EPSPs; epileptiform; dendritic spikes; hippocampus; neuromodulator	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GUINEA-PIG HIPPOCAMPUS; ENDOGENOUS ADENOSINE; GLUTAMATE RELEASE; NEURONS; SLICES; INVITRO; ACTIVATION; ISCHEMIA; BRAIN	The present study was done to determine the possible effects of endogenous adenosine, present in the extracellular fluid of the hippocampal slice, on pyramidal cells in the CA1 region using intracellular recording techniques. Administration of 5 mu M of the adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (n = 11), induced a depolarization (2.6 +/- 0.4 mV, mean +/- S.E.M.) with an increase in input resistance (6.7 +/- 2.1%) in pyramidal cells, and increased the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials elicited by stimulation of Schaffer collateral afferents; 50 mu M 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (n = 68) produced a similar depolarization (3.4 +/- 1.7 mV) and an increase in input resistance (26 +/- 3.0%), but also produced spontaneous, synchronized giant excitatory postsynaptic potentials which could generate bursts of spikes. These effects lasted more than 10 min after washout. In the presence of 20 mu M 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione, a non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, and 50 mu M D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, 50 mu M 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (n = 4) induced only depolarization (3.1 +/- 1.3 mV) and an increase in input resistance (23 +/- 3.8%). In the presence of 20 mu M 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione only, 50 mu M 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (n = 7) induced not only the depolarization with an increase in input resistance, but also the occurrence of small-amplitude (11 +/- 5.6 mV), fast rising, all-or-none, voltage-sensitive spikes of 2-3 ms duration, which were attributed to a dendritic origin. The latency of these dendritic spikes in response to stimulation of Schaffer collateral afferents lasted up to 21 ms. These dendritic spikes could generate one or more action potentials, depending on the resting membrane potential and the frequency of the dendritic spikes. In the presence of 50 mu M 8-sulfophenyltheophylline plus 20 mu M 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione, 50 mu M D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate blocked the spontaneous dendritic spikes (n = 4). In the presence of 5 mu M 8-sulfophenyltheophylline, 200 mu M N-methyl-D-aspartate (n = 5) increased the occurrence of dendritic spikes. These data indicate that adenosine present in the extracellular fluid of the hippocampal slice tonically inhibits not only (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate-mediated synaptic transmission, but also voltage- and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-sensitive dendritic spikes. Endogenous adenosine acting on adenosine A(1) receptors is thus visualized as a control to prevent the genesis of synchronized giant excitatory postsynaptic potentials. In our experiments, blockade of this tonic activation of adenosine receptors appears to have altered the origins of action potentials and led to epileptiform firing in CA1 pyramidal cells.

Hippocampal and cortical neuronal nitric oxide synthase and haem oxygenase-2 expressions were compared in young adult (6 months) and aged (24-26 months) Long-Evans rats. Aged rats were assigned as either cognitively unimpaired or impaired based on their performances in the Morris water maze behavioural task. In situ hybridization revealed increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA levels in selected regions of the hippocampi and cortices of aged rats. Moreover, aged cognitively impaired animals showed significantly higher neuronal nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA expression than aged cognitively unimpaired animals in several brain regions. For haem oxygenase-2 mRNA expressions, both young and aged cognitively impaired rats showed increased expressions in hippocampi compared with aged cognitively unimpaired rats, while no difference was found in cortices between all three animal groups. The increase in neuronal nitric oxide synthase messenger RNA expression levels in the aged animals may be related to increased free radical production occurring in ageing. Alternatively, elevated neuronal nitric oxide synthase and haem oxygenase-2 messenger RNA expressions may represent compensatory responses to oxidative stress and age-related changes in neuronal functions. Regarding cognitive status, aged cognitively impaired rats showed significant spatial memory deficits relative to young and aged cognitively unimpaired rats. Our data suggest a correlation between age-related cognitive impairment and change in messenger RNA expressions for the neuronal nitric oxide synthase and haem oxygenase-2 systems in brain areas implicated in learning and memory processes.

These findings are consistent with the proposed role of calbindin-D28k in photic signaling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus,(32) and point to the possibility that suppression of calbindin-D28k expression is linked to the mechanism by which constant light disrupts circadian rhythms.

Here we examine the effects of prolonged exposure to an escalating-dose regimen of amphetamine known to induce long-lasting sensitization to amphetamine and leading to increases in neuronal dendritic length and spine density in nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex and to decreases in spine density in occipital cortex. Astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor immunoreactivity was increased in both dopaminergic cell body and terminal regions one week after termination of a two-week amphetamine treatment (1-4 mg/kg). These effects were not evident one week after a five-week treatment (1-9 mg/kg) and, in fact, one month later basic fibroblast growth factor levels in cell body regions were decreased. In the occipital cortex, basic fibroblast growth factor immunoreactivity was decreased one week after the two-week amphetamine treatment, but was not different from that seen in saline-treated animals after the five-week treatment. Increased astrocytic basic fibroblast growth factor expression appears to be an early, but relatively prolonged, response to amphetamine exposure and seems to parallel structural changes induced by repeated drug exposure. These findings suggest that basic fibroblast growth factor may participate in the development of structural changes brought about by amphetamine. The fact that the basic fibroblast growth factor response is not maintained after prolonged intense exposure to amphetamine suggests that the factors that initially induce basic fibroblast growth factor expression are self-regulating.

J	Funk, D; Amir, S				Funk, D; Amir, S			Enhanced Fos expression within the primary olfactory and limbic pathways induced by an aversive conditioned odor stimulus	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR PERIRHINAL CORTEX; GENE C-FOS; CATECHOLAMINE INNERVATION; LATENT INHIBITION; LOCUS-COERULEUS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; NERVE INPUT; FEAR; RAT; AMYGDALA	A central question in olfactory learning is how animals become tuned to odor stimuli that gain significance through conditioning. A leading view is that tuning to conditioned odor stimuli involves functional modifications within the primary olfactory pathways, themselves.(7) Here we studied this idea further by investigating responses within the olfactory system to an odor that had previously been paired with footshock in classical fear-conditioning trials in adult rats. Using the transcription factor Fos as a marker of odor-induced neuronal activation,(1,14) we found that in rats that had received forward pairings of odor and footshock during training, presentation of the conditioned odor stimulus, alone, produced an enhanced increase in levels of Fos in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs and anterior olfactory nucleus compared with that found in animals that had received backward presentations of the stimuli or of odor alone. These results demonstrate that Fos responses to an odor within the primary olfactory pathways can be modified through aversive conditioning, and are consistent with other evidence that olfactory conditioning can lead to functional changes within these pathways,(7) (C) 2000 IBRO.

J	Poirier, JL; Capek, R; De Koninck, Y				Poirier, JL; Capek, R; De Koninck, Y			Differential progression of dark neuron and fluoro-jade labelling in the rat hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						argyophilia; acidophilia; NeuN; GFAP; confocal microscopy; stereology	ELECTRON-MICROSCOPIC FINDINGS; HYPOGLYCEMIC BRAIN-DAMAGE; TEMPORAL EVOLUTION; STEREOLOGICAL METHODS; PATHOLOGICAL RESEARCH; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SEIZURES; DEGENERATION; EPILEPSY; INJURY	To investigate the progression of cellular injury in a model of hippocampal epileptogenesis, we used two histochemical methods reported to specifically label injured neurons, the Dark Neuron stain and Fluoro-Jade. Pilocarpine was administered systemically (380 mg/kg i.p.) to induce status epilepticus. The duration of status epilepticus was controlled to last 1 h by stopping it with diazepam (4 mg/kg i.p.). The progression of cellular damage was quantified at six specific time points following the initial pilocarpine-induced insult: 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, one week, and three weeks. To assess, in parallel, neuronal loss in specific hippocampal regions throughout epileptogenesis, the neuronal nuclear protein NeuN was used as a specific marker of neurons. Results revealed a different time-dependent progression of Dark Neuron and Fluoro-Jade labelling following status epilepticus. A significantly greater proportion of silver impregnated cells labelled by the Dark Neuron stain was quantified in the stratum radiatum and stratum pyramidale of CA1 at the early time point of 3 h compared with the proportion of Fluoro-Jade labelling in adjacent sections. In contrast, the maximal staining with Fluoro-Jade appeared at a later stage during epileptogenesis (between 24 h and one week), with a significantly greater proportion of neurons labelled compared to the Dark Neuron stain in the stratum radiatum of CA1, stratum pyramidale of CA1, stratum radiatum of CA3 and the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. Neurons from control animals were not significantly labelled by either of the two staining methods. Interestingly, the increase in Fluoro-Jade labelling corresponded in time to neuron loss. The two stains therefore appear to highlight separate processes of neuronal damage. This finding indicates that distinct cellular events take place at different stages of epileptogenesis, which may differ considerably from the permanent changes observed in chronically epileptic tissue.

J	Trudeau, LE				Trudeau, LE			Neurotensin regulates intracellular calcium in ventral tegmental area astrocytes: Evidence for the involvement of multiple receptors	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neurotensin; astrocytes; calcium; ventral tegmental area; desensitization; phospholipase C	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; RAT SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; H-3 DOPAMINE RELEASE; BINDING-SITE DENSITY; NEUROMEDIN-N; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; PRIMARY CULTURE; NEURONS	Recent evidence suggests that some types of neurotensin receptors may be expressed by astrocytes. In order to explore the function of neurotensin receptors in astrocytes, the effect of a neurotensin receptor agonist, neurotensin(8-13), on intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in mixed neuronal/glial cultures prepared from rat ventral tegmental area was examined. It was found that neurotensin(8-13) induces a long-lasting rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a subset of glial fibrilary acidic protein-positive glial cells. This response displays extensive desensitization and appears to implicate both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ sources. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, neurotensin(8-13) evokes only a short-lasting rise in intracellular Ca2+. The neurotensin-evoked intracellular Ca2+ accumulation is blocked by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 and by thapsigargin, suggesting that it is initiated by release of Ca2+ from an inositol triphosphate-dependent store. The Ca2+-mobilizing action of neurotensin(8-13) in astrocytes is dependent on at least two receptors, because the response is blocked in part only by SR48692, a type 1 neurotensin receptor antagonist, and is blocked completely by SR142948A, a novel neurotensin receptor antagonist. The finding that the type 2 neurotensin receptor agonist levocabastine fails to mimic or alter the effects of neurotensin(8-13) on intracellular Ca2+ makes it unlikely that the type 2 neurotensin receptor is involved. In summary, these results show that functional neurotensin receptors are present in cultured ventral tegmental area astrocytes and that their activation induces a highly desensitizing rise in intracellular Ca2+. The pharmacological profile of this response suggests that a type 1 neurotensin receptor is involved but that another, possibly novel, non-type 2 neurotensin receptor is also implicated. If present in vivo, such signalling could be involved in some of the physiological actions of neurotensin. (C) 2000 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Given its purported role in motion analysis and the conflicting reports regarding the texture sensitivity of this area, we have investigated the response properties of cells in PMLS to moving texture patterns ("visual noise"). In contrast to previous reports, we have found that a large majority of cells (80.1%) responds to the motion of a texture pattern with sustained discharges. In general, responses to noise were more broadly tuned for direction compared to gratings; however, direction selectivity appeared more pronounced in response to noise. The majority of cells was selective for drift velocity of the noise pattern (mean optimal velocity: 26.7 degrees/s). Velocity tuning was comparable to that of its principal thalamic input, the lateral posterior pulvinar nucleus. In general, responsiveness of cells in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex increased with increasing texture element size, although some units were tuned to smaller element sizes than the largest presented. Finally, the magnitude of these noise responses was dependent on the area of the visual field stimulated. In general, a stimulus corresponding to roughly twice the size of the receptive field was required to elicit an equivalent half-maximal response to that for gratings. The results of this study indicate that the majority of cells in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex can be driven by the motion of a fine texture field, and highlight the importance of this area in motion analysis.

J	Tardif, E; Lepore, F; Guillemot, JP				Tardif, E; Lepore, F; Guillemot, JP			Spatial properties and direction selectivity of single neurons in area 21b of the cat	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						spatial frequency; temporal frequency; area 21b; contrast sensitivity	SUPRASYLVIAN VISUAL-CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; ORIENTATION SPECIFICITY; RESPONSE PROPERTIES	The receptive field properties of single units were assessed in area 21b of the cat visual cortex. Visual cells in this area were binocular and showed relatively large receptive fields. Most cells were strongly sensitive to the direction of drifting gratings. The mean value of the half-widths of the direction tuning curves (32 degrees) suggests broader direction tunings than are typically found in other visual areas. The spatial frequency tuning functions were either band-pass or low-pass. Cells responded optimally to low spatial frequencies (mean = 0.08 c/deg) and also showed low spatial resolution (mean = 0.29 c/deg.). The estimated values of spatial bandwidths (mean = 2.2 octaves) suggest that area 21b cells act as relatively good spatial filters. Although some cells exhibited a low contrast threshold, most cells began to respond at intermediate or high contrast values (mean threshold = 15.5%). Temporal frequency tuning functions were mostly band-pass and usually broad (mean temporal bandwidth = 3.3 octaves). Cells were found that responded optimally to various temporal frequencies (mean optimal temporal frequency = 3.2 Hz), although the majority preferred a temporal frequency below 4 Hz. These results suggest that visual properties (receptive fields sizes, spatial resolution and orientation/direction selectivity) of cells in area 21b differ from those of cells previously observed in the adjoining area 21a. These differences provide evidence in support of functional distinction between these two visual areas. (C) 2000 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here we report on the effects of bilateral neonatal (postnatal day 7) ibotenate-induced lesions to the medial prefrontal cortex on nucleus accumbens dopamine and neuroendocrine function in adult rats. Voltammetry was used to monitor the dopamine response to each of five, once-daily exposures to tail-pinch stress whereas alterations in neuroendocrine function were determined from the plasma corticosterone response to a single 20-min episode of restraint stress. Potential lesion-induced deficits in sensory-motor gating were assessed by measuring prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response before and after repeated stress. Our data show that each daily stress episode elicited larger and longer-lasting dopamine increases in prefrontal cortex-lesioned animals than in sham-lesioned controls. Furthermore, greater stress-induced elevations in plasma corticosterone were seen in lesioned animals than in their sham-lesioned counterparts. However, while repeated stress potentiated startle responses in animals of both groups, there was no effect of lesion on the amplitude or on prepulse inhibition of the startle response. Together, these findings indicate that neonatal prefrontal cortex damage can lead to changes in mesolimbic dopamine and neuroendocrine function during adulthood. They also add to a growing body of experimental and clinical evidence implicating abnormal prefrontal cortex neuronal development in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other disorders linked to central dopamine dysfunction.

This period of enhanced excitation is followed by a rebound overshoot in these animals. As previous evidence indicates opioid mechanisms in a similar rebound in normal animals, the present study was done to determine the effects of systemic administration of morphine and the opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone, on the stimulus-induced responses in the tail withdrawal reflex. Once baseline reaction times had been taken, different combinations of saline, naloxone and morphine were administered intraperitoneally to transgenic and control mice of either sex. A mechanical conditioning stimulus of 450 g was then applied to the tip of the tail for 2 s. This stimulus was innocuous in control mice given saline or naloxone, but provoked a nociceptive response in transgenic mice given these compounds. In control and transgenic mice, following morphine administration there was an antinociceptive effect. In control mice the subsequent mechanical stimulus had no effect. However, in transgenic mice the mechanical stimulus produced a further antinociception. Naloxone blocked the effect of morphine and the subsequent conditioning stimulus in both control and transgenic mice. The results indicate that while morphine is equally effective on the withdrawal reflex in both types of animal, in the transgenic mice morphine reveals an intrinsic, naloxone sensitive antinociceptive mechanism. The data are interpreted to suggest that overexpression of substance P or some other factor in the spinal cord of transgenic mice is associated with the up-regulation or facilitation of an opiate-mediated intrinsic antinociceptive mechanism. This is a novel observation because the genetic manipulation in this transgenic mouse results in a transient over-expression of nerve growth factor during development that leads to the formation of ectopic primary afferent fibres in the spinal cord containing substance P. These fibres persist indefinitely after the nerve growth factor levels return to normal. Opioid mechanisms, which are likely of dorsal horn origin, do not fall under the direct influence of nerve growth factor mechanisms and therefore the intriguing possibility is raised that opioid mechanisms in the spinal cord are regulated at least in part by substance P-related mechanisms.

Compared with non-ataxic controls, staggerer mutants had inferior performances in the open field, the wooden beam, the wooden edge, and the rotorod tests. An increase in cytochrome oxidase activity in the deep cerebellar nuclei and in some cerebellar efferent regions, such as the lateral vestibular nucleus, the parvicellular red nucleus, and the ventral tegmental area, was found in staggerer mutant mice. Abnormally high cytochrome oxidase activity in the interpositus and the dentate nuclei was linearly correlated with poor performance on the wooden beam and on the rotorod. High cytochrome oxidase activity in the lateral vestibular nucleus was also associated with poor performance on the wooden beam. Moreover, high cytochrome oxidase activity in the fastigial nucleus was associated with poor performance on the wooden beam but with high motor activity in the open field. These results indicate that a lack of innervation of Purkinje cells to the deep cerebellar nuclei is in part the cause of motor co-ordination deficits in staggerer mutant mice. (C) 1999 IBRO.

This study explored the possible role of brainstem mu- and delta-opioid systems in these effects. Medullary sections were obtained from 6 to 7 (young) and 20 to 21-day-old (older) piglets either unexposed or exposed prenatally to a 2-mg/kg intravenous cocaine hydrochloride dose, injected to the pregnant sow four times a day during the last third of gestation. mu- and delta-opioid receptor binding was assessed by quantitative autoradiography using, respectively, I-125-DAMGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N-Me-Phe-Gly-ol) and I-125-DPDPE (Tyr-D-Pen-Gly-pCl-Phe-D-Pen). At control, delta-, but not mu-opioid, receptor density increased with postnatal age. In contrast, cocaine-induced mu-, but not delta-opioid, receptor density increased 1) in the dorsal motor vagal (dmnX) and facial (nF) nuclei, and, at borderline significance level, in the cardiorespiratory-related gigantocellular reticular nucleus (nRG) of the young, and 2) in the spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract (nSp5), and in the cardiorespiratory-related medial solitary tract (nTSm) and lateral reticular (nRL) nuclei of both age groups. These findings support a possible participation of the mu-opioid system in the attenuation of arousal and cardiorespiration after repeated prenatal exposure to cocaine. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

It is considered to be a mediator of many of the effects of stress, and its analgesic properties have been demonstrated in many studies. However, for primarily methodological reasons, the effects of CRF in the central nervous system have been neglected whereas the peripheral effects of CRF have been overemphasized. We present evidence that: (1) CRF can act at all levels of the neuraxis to produce analgesia; (2) the release of beta-endorphin does not explain the analgesia following intravenous or intracranial CRF administration; (3) inflammation must be present for local CRF to evoke analgesia and (4) the analgesic effects of CRF show specificity for prolonged pain. These findings suggest that CRF may have a significant role in chronic pain syndromes associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis abnormalities. Furthermore, CRF may represent a new class of analgesics that merits further study. Implications for the relationship between stress and pain are discussed.

In vivo studies have shown that layer II of the EC is a robust generator of theta as well as gamma activity, Theta may also be present in layer V, but the layer V network is particularly prone to genesis of short-lasting high-frequency oscillations ("ripples"). Interestingly, in vitro studies have shown that EC layers II and V,but not layer III, have the potential to act as independent pacemakers of population oscillatory activity. Moreover, it has also been shown that subgroups of principal neurons both within layers II and V, but not layer III, are endowed with autorhythmic properties. These are characterized by subthreshold oscillations where the depolarizing phase is driven by the activation of "persistent" Na+ channels, We propose that the oscillatory properties of layer II and V neurons and local circuits are responsible for setting up the proper temporal dynamics for the coordination of the multiple sensory inputs that converge onto EC and thus help to generate sensory representations and memory encoding.

In all three spatial memory experiments presented in this paper, patients with Lesions that included the right parahippocampal cortex were seriously impaired. Their impairment, together with the performance of patients with lesions to the right hippocampus (sparing the right parahippocampal cortex), provides the different patterns of deficits that lead to different interpretations of the function of the parahippocampal cortex. The distinction between the effects of functional damage in hippocampus and the effects of a lesion to the hippocampus or to regions surrounding the hippocampus, such as the parahippocampal cortex, is emphasized. We conclude that the right parahippocampal cortex participates in spatial memory beyond serving as a gateway to the hippocampus.

We have developed detailed simulations of entorhinal cortical neurons and networks, with an emphasis on the role of acetylcholine in entorhinal cortical function. Computational modeling suggests that when acetylcholine levels are high, this sets appropriate dynamics for the storage of stimuli during performance of delayed matching tasks. In particular, acetylcholine activates a calcium-sensitive nonspecific cation current which provides an intrinsic cellular mechanism which could maintain neuronal activity across a delay period. Simulations demonstrate how this phenomena could underlie entorhinal cortex delay activity as described in previous unit recordings.(191,164) Acetylcholine also induces theta rhythm oscillations which may be appropriate for timing of afferent input to be encoded in hippocampus and for extraction of individual stored sequences from multiple stored sequences. Lower levels of acetylcholine may allow sharp wave dynamics which can reactivate associations encoded in hippocampus and drive the formation of additional traces in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during consolidation.

We performed high-resolution MRI volumetric analysis to examine in vivo the morphology of the parahippocampal region in 20 healthy subjects and 6 TLE patients with MRI evidence of unilateral hippocampal atrophy. In normal controls the standardized volume of the left entorhinal cortex (EC) was 1305 +/- 138 mm(3) and that of the right EC was 1376 +/- 170 mm(3); the left perirhinal cortex (PC) was 2900 +/- 554 mm(3) and the right PC was 2771 +/- 486 mm3; the Left posterior parahippocampal cortex (PPC) was 2499 +/- 583 mm(3) and the right PPC was 2234 +/- 404 mm(3). Using a 2 standard deviation cutoff from the mean of normal controls, we found ipsilateral to the seizure focus: (i) a reduction in the volume of the EC in all patients; (ii) a reduction of the PC in 2/6 (33%) patients; (iii) no reduction in the volume of the PPC in any patient. In 3/6 (50 %) of patients, the EC was also abnormally small contralateral to the seizure focus, In patients with unilateral TLE, the EC is the most affected structure within the parahippocampal region, Whether this is due to a primary role of the EC in the genesis of TLE or is the consequence of its pivotal position in the reciprocal flow of information between the hippocampus and the neo- and limbic cortices remains to be explored.

Accumulation of p27kip1 in post-mitotic neurons is a major event of neurogenesis. We hypothesized that a dysregulation of the expression of p53 and these cdk inhibitors underlies cellular proliferation in medulloblastomas, and tested this hypothesis by investigating p27kip1, p21cip1, Bcl2 and p53 immunoreactivity in 14 medulloblastoma tumors. We noted an inverse relationship between p27kip1 expression and cellular proliferation (MIB1). Focal islands of neuroblastic or glial differentiation expressed high levels of p27kip1, while the undifferentiated, highly-proliferative population of tumor cells showed no detectable p27kip1 expression, thus suggesting a role for p27kip1 in cell cycle control in medulloblastoma. In addition, there was no detectable p21cip1 expression in any of the medulloblastomas studied. The low level of apoptosis displayed by these tumors was not associated with the expression of Bcl-2. A significant relationship was found between detection of p53 protein and poor survival. Since: p21cip1 and p27kip1 are often co-expressed with other INK4 family of cdk inhibitors during the induction of cellular differentiation and are synergistic in their effect, a deregulation of their coordinate expression may underlie the lack of complete differentiation in medulloblastoma.

Questions for the patient should attempt to rule out systemic symptoms and clarify the pain pattern. Some of the most possible causes of groin pain include stress fracture of the femoral neck or pubic ramus, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, acetabular labral tears, iliopectineal bursitis, avulsion fracture, osteitis pubis, strain of the thigh muscles or rectus abdominis, inguinal hernia, ilioinguinal neuralgia, and the 'sports hernia'. Depending on the diagnosis, conservative treatment is often effective.

However, TKs appear to have an indirect effect in HIB by releasing leukotriene (LT)D-4. We postulated that BK may cause bronchoconstriction through a cascade involving TK and LTD4. We examined the role of TK and LTD4 in BK-induced bronchoconstriction in ventilated Hartley guinea-pigs, Respiratory resistance (R-rs) was monitored for 2 h following insufflation of BK (150 nM). Animals were pretreated with propranolol, then with either neurokinin (NK)1 (CP-99,994) + NK2 (SR-48,968) receptor antagonists or pranlukast (90 mu g or 900 mu g), an LTD4 antagonist, Control animals received no pretreatment. BK-induced bronchoconstriction was significantly lower in NK1/NK2 (128% +/- 6% baseline R-rs SEM) and pranlukast (90 mu g; 205 +/- 22, 900 mu g; 169 +/- 20) animals compared to controls (284 +/- 22), P<0.0001 ANOVA. Bile from control and saline challenged animals,vas analysed for LTD, by HPLC and radio-immunoassay, However, LTD, excretion rate showed no significant difference over a 2-h collection period following insufflation of either BK or saline, respectively; baseline = 2.5 pmol/h +/- 0.6 SEM vs, 2.3 +/- 0.2, 0-1 h = 2.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.6, 1-2 h = 2.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.7. We conclude that BK-induced bronchoconstriction is mediated in part through the release of both TK and LTD4, but the latter is released in insufficient quantities to be detectable by biliary analysis, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Among the inadequacies identified (Shepperd et al.) in most of the proposed measures for the similarity attribute, the most critical is that they are used only when the software projects are described by numerical variables (interval, ratio or absolute scale). However, in practice, many factors which describe software projects, such as the experience of programmers and the complexity of modules, are measured in terms of an ordinal (or nominal) scale composed of qualifications such as 'low' and 'high'. To overcome this limitation, we propose a set of new measures based on fuzzy logic for similarity when the software projects are described by categorical data. In this work, the proposed measures are validated by means of an axiomatic validation approach. We also present in this paper the results of an empirical validation of our similarity measures, based on the COCOMO'81 database.

Recently, several neural network (NN) based schemes developed in this area. In particular, constructive feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) have been attempted by many researchers to this problem. The constructive NN-based schemes are promising given their lower training cost, satisfactory performance and automatic determination of proper network size. In this paper, we first consider a NN-based technique that uses a constructive one-hidden-layer FNN for image compression. In standard NN-based schemes when a new hidden unit is added to the net the whole net is retrained, while in this scheme the input-side weights are first trained and then all the network output-side weights are adjusted, resulting in a considerably less computational efforts. Next, two pruning techniques are proposed to remove the unnecessary input-side weights during the network construction, without sacrificing the performance of the network, to yield a smaller and a more economical network. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, we have applied them to both regression problems and image compression. It has been found that a significant number of weights can be pruned without degenerating the network performance.

Its efficacy and safety were tested in the CLomethiazole Acute Stroke Study (CLASS). The protocol allowed a CT scan to be done after randomization but within 7 days of stroke onset to minimize delays before start of treatment. Ninety-five of the 1360 patients randomized were diagnosed as having intracranial hemorrhage rather than ischemic stroke. Safety results for clomethiazole compared with-placebo in this group are reported. Methods-The study included patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute hemispheric cerebral infarction. Treatment was a 24-hour intravenous infusion of 75 mg/kg clomethiazole or placebo. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage discovered on a postrandomization CT were withdrawn from study treatment if treatment was ongoing, and all patients were followed up to 90 days. Results-Ninety-four patients received treatment, 47 in each group. The hemorrhage was classified as intracerebral in 89 patients (94%). Mortality at 90 days was 19.1% in the clomethiazole group and 23.4% in the placebo group, Sedation was the most common adverse event, occurring at a higher incidence in clomethiazole-treated patients (clomethiazole 53%, placebo 17%), followed by rhinitis and coughing. The incidence and pattern of serious adverse events was similar between the treatment groups. The percentage of patients reaching relative functional independence on the Barthel Index (score greater than or equal to 60) at 90 days was 59.6% in the clomethiazole group and 53.2% in the placebo group. Conclusions-Clomethiazole appears safe to administer to hemorrhagic stroke patients compared with placebo. These results would obviate the need for a CT scan before therapy is initiated in acute stroke. The safety of clomethiazole in hemorrhagic stroke patients will be further evaluated in a prospective study that is under way in North America.

VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						crowding; foveal vision; visual system	IDENTIFICATION; CONTRAST; CORTEX; ACUITY; VISION	It has been known for some lime that both foveal and peripheral visual acuity is higher for single letters than for letters in a row. Early work showed that this was due to the destructive interaction of adjacent contours (termed 'crowding' or contour interaction). It has been assumed to have a neural basis and a number of competing explanations have been advanced which implicate either high-level or low-level stages of visual processing. Our results suggest a much simpler explanation, one primarily determined by the physics of the stimulus rather than the physiology of the visual system. We show that, under conditions of contour. interaction or 'crowding', the most relevant physical spatial frequency band of the letter is displaced to higher spatial frequencies and that foveal vision tracks this change in spatial scale.

This study explores the accuracy with which subjects can discriminate head orientation when the eyes are centered in the head. Discrimination thresholds averaged 1.9 degrees of head rotation for base head orientations of 0 degrees and 15 degrees, bur discrimination was markedly poorer around a 30 degrees head orientation. Results were independent of spatial frequency and size over a 4-fold range. Neither negative contrast nor head inversion affected discrimination; Experiments dissociating the internal features from head outline revealed the presence of two main cues to discrimination: deviation of the head profile from bilateral symmetry, and deviation of nose orientation from vertical. Simulations show that model V4 units revealed in previous experiments with Glass patterns can extract the relevant head orientation information. The data are consistent with neurological data indicating a selective loss of face recognition in prosopagnosia with spared gaze discrimination. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Contrast thresholds of older and younger observers were measured for static and drifting gratings defined by luminance (first-order) or by contrast (second-order), and for a temporally segmented second-order motion stimulus. Results showed that older individuals had a larger threshold elevation for the perception of second-order stimuli than for the perception of first-order stimuli. This suggests a dissociation between the mechanisms underlying the perception of first and second-order stimuli, and demonstrates that aging may affect the more numerous processing steps required for the analysis of higher level stimuli.

In keeping with previous results, we find that performance dominated by a linear motion mechanism is obtained using high densities of micropatterns and small temporal intervals between frames, while nonlinear performance is found with low densities and longer temporal intervals [Boulton, J. C., & Baker, C. L. (1994) Proceedings of SPIE, computational vision based on neurobiology, 2054, 124-133]. We compare direction discrimination and detection thresholds in the presence of variable luminance and chromatic noise, Our results show that the linear motion response obtained from chromatic stimuli is selectively masked by luminance noise; the effect is selective for motion since luminance noise masks direction discrimination thresholds but not stimulus detection. Furthermore, we find that chromatic noise has the reverse effect to luminance noise: detection thresholds for the linear chromatic stimulus are masked by chromatic noise but direction discrimination is relatively unaffected. We thus reveal a linear 'chromatic' mechanism that is susceptible to luminance noise but relatively unaffected by color noise. The nonlinear chromatic mechanism behaves differently since both detection and direction discrimination are unaffected by luminance noise but masked by chromatic noise. The double dissociation between the effects of chromatic and luminance noise on linear and nonlinear motion mechanisms is not based on stimulus speed or differences in the temporal presentations of the stimuli. We conclude that: (1) 'chromatic' linear motion is solely based on a luminance signal, probably arising from cone-based temporal phase shifts; (2) the nonlinear chromatic motion mechanism is purely chromatic; and (3) we find the same results for both perifoveal and foveal presentations.

Studies of contour integration and motion trajectory detection suggest that network operations between local detectors underlie the encoding of extended contours in space and extended trajectories in motion. Here we ask whether such network operations also occur between second-order-detectors known to exist in visual cortex. We compared performance for stimuli composed of either first-order or second-order elements equated for visibility, and we show that unlike the first-order case, there is little or no linking interaction between local second-order detectors. Near chance performance was found for elements defined by second-order attributes when observers had to identify either an elongated spatial contour or an extended motion trajectory embedded in noise elements. This implies that the network operations thought to underlie these two global tasks receive, at best, an impoverished input from local detectors that encode second-order image attributes.

J	Scott-Samuel, NE; Smith, AT				Scott-Samuel, NE; Smith, AT			No local cancellation between directionally opposed first-order and second-order motion signals	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						motion; motion detection; human vision; contrast modulation; second-order motion	2ND-ORDER MOTION; VISUAL-MOTION; BRAIN-DAMAGE; PERCEPTION; PATTERNS	Despite strong converging evidence that there are separate mechanisms for the processing of first-order and second-order motion, the issue remains controversial. Qian, Andersen and Adelson (J. Neurosci., 14 (1994), 7357-7366) have shown that first-order motion signals cancel if locally balanced. Here we show that this is also the case for second-order motion signals, but not for a mixture of first-order and second-order motion even when the visibility of the two types of stimulus is equated. Our motion sequence consisted of a dynamic binary noise carrier divided into horizontal strips of equal height, each of which was spatially modulated in either contrast or luminance by a 1.0 c/deg sinusoid. The modulation moved leftward or rightward (3.75 Hz) in alternate strips. The single-interval task was to identify the direction of motion of the central strip. Three conditions were tested: all second-order strips, all first-order strips, and spatially alternated first-order and second-order strips. In the first condition, a threshold strip height for the second-order strips was obtained at a contrast modulation depth of 100%. In the second condition, this height was used for the first-order strips, and a threshold was obtained in terms of luminance contrast. These two previously-obtained threshold values were used to equate visibility of the first-order and second-order components in the third condition. Direction identification, instead of being at threshold, was near-perfect for all observers. We argue that the first two conditions demonstrate local cancellation of motion signals, whereas in the third condition this does not occur. We attribute this non-cancellation td separate processing of first-order and second-order motion inputs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
