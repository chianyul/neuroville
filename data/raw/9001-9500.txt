The Rates of Protein Synthesis and Degradation Account for the Differential Response of Neurons to Spaced and Massed Training Protocols	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM-MEMORY; C APL-II; APLYSIA SENSORY NEURONS; KINASE-C; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; COUPLED-RECEPTOR; HETEROSYNAPTIC FACILITATION; ISOFORM SPECIFICITY; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PDZ-DOMAIN	The sensory-motor neuron synapse of Aplysia is an excellent model system for investigating the biochemical changes underlying memory formation. In this system, training that is separated by rest periods (spaced training) leads to persistent changes in synaptic strength that depend on biochemical pathways that are different from those that occur when the training lacks rest periods (massed training). Recently, we have shown that in isolated sensory neurons, applications of serotonin, the neurotransmitter implicated in inducing these synaptic changes during memory formation, lead to desensitization of the PKC Apl II response, in a manner that depends on the method of application (spaced versus massed). Here, we develop a mathematical model of this response in order to gain insight into how neurons sense these different training protocols. The model was developed incrementally, and each component was experimentally validated, leading to two novel findings: First, the increased desensitization due to PKA-mediated heterologous desensitization is coupled to a faster recovery than the homologous desensitization that occurs in the absence of PKA activity. Second, the model suggests that increased spacing leads to greater desensitization due to the short half-life of a hypothetical protein, whose production prevents homologous desensitization. Thus, we predict that the effects of differential spacing are largely driven by the rates of production and degradation of proteins. This prediction suggests a powerful mechanism by which information about time is incorporated into neuronal processing.

The silica beads are derivatized by poly-D-lysine or lipid bilayers. Molecular features known to exist at presynapses are clearly present at these artificial synapses, as visualized by cryo-EM. Key synaptic features such as the membrane contact area at synaptic junctions, the presynaptic bouton containing presynaptic vesicles, as well as microtubular structures can be identified. This is the first report of the direct, label-free observation of ultrastructural details of artificial synapses.	[Gopalakrishnan, Gopakumar; Madwar, Carolin; Lennox, R.

Brain Perfusion in Asphyxiated Newborns Treated with Therapeutic Hypothermia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; WHOLE-BODY HYPOTHERMIA; NEONATAL ENCEPHALOPATHY; FETAL SHEEP; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; PERINATAL ASPHYXIA; BIRTH ASPHYXIA; INJURY; OXYGENATION	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Induced hypothermia is thought to work partly by mitigating reperfusion injury in asphyxiated term neonates. The purpose of this study was to assess brain perfusion in the first week of life in these neonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, MR imaging and ASL-PI were used to assess brain perfusion in these neonates. We measured regional CBF values on 1-2 MR images obtained during the first week of life and compared these with values obtained in control term neonates. The same or later MR imaging scans were obtained to define the extent of brain injury. RESULTS: Eighteen asphyxiated and 4 control term neonates were enrolled; 11 asphyxiated neonates were treated with hypothermia. Those developing brain injury despite being treated with induced hypothermia usually displayed hypoperfusion on DOL 1 and then hyperperfusion on DOL 2-3 in brain areas subsequently exhibiting injury. Asphyxiated neonates not treated with hypothermia who developed brain injury also displayed hyperperfusion on DOL 1-6 in brain areas displaying injury. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that ASL-PI may be useful for identifying asphyxiated neonates at risk of developing brain injury, whether or not hypothermia is administered. Because hypothermia for 72 hours may not prevent brain injury when hyperperfusion is found early in the course of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, such neonates may be candidates for adjustments in their hypothermia therapy or for adjunctive neuroprotective therapies.

Rare variants in the CYP27B1 gene are associated with multiple sclerosis	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							VITAMIN-D DEFICIENCY; D-DEPENDENT RICKETS; 1-ALPHA-HYDROXYLASE DEFICIENCY; RISK ALLELES; GENOME; MUTATIONS; DISEASE; ALIGNMENT; FAMILIES; LINKAGE	Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurological disease. Genetic linkage analysis and genotyping of candidate genes in families with 4 or more affected individuals more heavily loaded for susceptibility genes has not fully explained familial disease clustering. Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing to further understand the heightened prevalence of MS in these families. Results: Forty-three individuals with MS (1 from each family) were sequenced to find rare variants in candidate MS susceptibility genes. On average, >58,000 variants were identified in each individual. A rare variant in the CYP27B1 gene causing complete loss of gene function was identified in 1 individual. Homozygosity for this mutation results in vitamin D-dependent rickets I (VDDR1), whereas heterozygosity results in lower calcitriol levels. This variant showed significant heterozygous association in 3,046 parent-affected child trios (p = 1 x 10(-5)). Further genotyping in >12,500 individuals showed that other rare loss of function CYP27B1 variants also conferred significant risk of MS, Peto odds ratio = 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 2.3-9.4; p = 5 x 10(-7)). Four known VDDR1 mutations were identified, all overtransmitted. Heterozygous parents transmitted these alleles to MS offspring 35 of 35x (p = 3 x 10(-9)). Interpretation: A causative role for CYP27B1 in MS is supported; the mutations identified are known to alter function having been shown in vivo to result in rickets when 2 copies are present. CYP27B1 encodes the vitamin D-activating 1-alpha hydroxylase enzyme, and thus a role for vitamin D in MS pathogenesis is strongly implicated.

Rare copy number variants are an important cause of epileptic encephalopathies	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; RECURRENT MICRODELETIONS; 15Q13.3 MICRODELETIONS; CHROMOSOMAL DELETIONS; DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY; 16P13.11 PREDISPOSE; MENTAL-RETARDATION; GENOMIC DISORDERS; INFANTILE SPASMS; EPISODIC ATAXIA	Objective: Rare copy number variants (CNVs)deletions and duplicationshave recently been established as important risk factors for both generalized and focal epilepsies. A systematic assessment of the role of CNVs in epileptic encephalopathies, the most devastating and often etiologically obscure group of epilepsies, has not been performed. Methods: We evaluated 315 patients with epileptic encephalopathies characterized by epilepsy and progressive cognitive impairment for rare CNVs using a high-density, exon-focused, whole-genome oligonucleotide array. Results: We found that 25 of 315 (7.9%) of our patients carried rare CNVs that may contribute to their phenotype, with at least one-half being clearly or likely pathogenic. We identified 2 patients with overlapping deletions at 7q21 and 2 patients with identical duplications of 16p11.2. In our cohort, large deletions were enriched in affected individuals compared to controls, and 4 patients harbored 2 rare CNVs. We screened 2 novel candidate genes found within the rare CNVs in our cohort but found no mutations in our patients with epileptic encephalopathies. We highlight several additional novel candidate genes located in CNV regions. Interpretation: Our data highlight the significance of rare CNVs in the epileptic encephalopathies, and we suggest that CNV analysis should be considered in the genetic evaluation of these patients. Our findings also highlight novel candidate genes for further study.

Early Risk Factors for Hyperactivity-Impulsivity and Inattention Trajectories From Age 17 Months to 8 Years	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; PHYSICAL AGGRESSION; PREMATURE-INFANTS; BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS; PRENATAL SMOKING; MATERNAL SMOKING; GESTATIONAL-AGE; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN BORN; TOBACCO-SMOKE	Context: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is an etiologically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition with long-term negative outcomes. However, the early developmental course of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms and their association with previous environmental risk factors are still poorly understood Objectives: To describe the developmental trajectories of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms and to identify their prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors. Design: Birth cohort from the general population. Setting: Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. Participants: The sample consisted of 2057 individuals, followed up from age 5 months to 8 years. Main Outcome Measures: Prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors assessed at age 5 months were considered predictors of group membership in high hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention trajectories from age 17 months to 8 years. Results: The frequency of hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms tended to slightly decrease with age, whereas the frequency of inattention symptoms substantially increased up to age 6 years. However, trajectories of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms were significantly associated with each other. Risk factors for high trajectories of both types of symptoms were premature birth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.93; 95% CI, 1.07-3.50), low birth weight (2.11; 1.12-3.98), prenatal tobacco exposure (1.41; 1.03-1.93), nonintact family (1.85; 1.26-2.70), young maternal age at birth of the target child (1.78; 1.17-2.69), paternal history of antisocial behavior (1.78; 1.28-2.47), and maternal depression (1.35; 1.18-1.54). Conclusions: A large range of early risk factors, including prenatal, perinatal social, and parental psychopathology variables, act independently to heighten the likelihood of having persistently high levels of hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms from infancy to middle childhood. Early interventions should be experimented with to provide effective tools for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder prevention.

In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, CD8(+) T lymphocytes are found in spinal cord and brainstem lesions. However, the exact phenotype of central nervous system-infiltrating CD8(+) T lymphocytes and the mechanism by which these cells cross the blood-brain barrier remain largely unknown. Using cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and coronavirus-induced encephalitis, we demonstrate that central nervous system-infiltrating CD8(+) T lymphocytes are mostly of the effector memory phenotype (CD62L(-) CCR7(-) granzymeB(hi)). We further show that purified human effector memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes transmigrate more readily across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells than non-effector memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and that blood-brain barrier endothelium promotes the selective recruitment of effector memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the recruitment of interferon-gamma- and interleukin-17-secreting CD8(+) T lymphocytes by human and mouse blood-brain barrier endothelium. Finally, we show that in vitro migration of CD8(+) T lymphocytes across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells is dependent on alpha 4 integrin, but independent of intercellular adhesion molecule-1/leucocyte function-associated antigen-1, activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule/CD6 and the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1/CCL2. We also demonstrate that in vivo neutralization of very late antigen-4 restricts central nervous system infiltration of CD8(+) T lymphocytes in active immunization and adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and in coronavirus-induced encephalitis. Our study thus demonstrates an active role of the blood-brain barrier in the recruitment of effector memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes to the CNS compartment and defines alpha 4 integrin as a major contributor of CD8(+) T lymphocyte entry into the brain.

We used a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach to assess the involvement of the dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene polymorphism in mediating reading disability and poor attention in a general population sample of primary school children aged 6-11 years in the UK. The potential confounding effects of IQ and chronological age were also investigated. We found an independent association between the homozygous DAT1 10/10 repeat genotype and RD that was not accounted for by the level of ADHD symptoms. This finding suggests that the DAT1 gene polymorphism may influence a common neural mechanism underlying both reading acquisition and ADHD symptoms. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

B cells in multiple sclerosis: connecting the dots	CURRENT OPINION IN IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review							MYELIN OLIGODENDROCYTE GLYCOPROTEIN; ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC ANTIBODY; ANTIMYELIN BASIC-PROTEIN; NERVOUS-SYSTEM TISSUE; EXPANDED PLASMA-CELLS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; IMMUNOGLOBULIN-G; AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; CLONAL EXPANSION	Over the past two decades B cells have increasingly moved into the spotlight in multiple sclerosis (MS) research. This interest was fuelled by growing understanding and acceptance of pathological involvement of B cells and antibodies in MS. Data derived from animal models of MS, human histopathological studies, and analyses of B cells in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have permitted the integration of B cells in our overall picture of MS immunopathogenesis. The as yet strongest direct evidence for a central role of B cells in MS autoimmunity was the demonstration that peripheral B cell depletion leads to a rapid decline of disease-activity in MS. While lending formidable impact to peripheral blood B cells as mediators of disease activity, the effects of anti-CD20 treatment also seemingly challenged the paradigm of a role of antibodies in targeted central nervous system (CNS) myelin destruction. This review shall attempt to provide an overview of our current understanding of B cell and antibody mediated mechanisms relevant to MS. We will include findings from, both, human studies, and animal models to highlight the complexity of B cell function as it pertains to MS. B cells appear to be effective drivers of inflammatory activity in MS by way of a diverse toolset of cellular functions. These functions appear to be closely linked to B cells that can be found in the periphery. However, by serving as the source of antibodies, B cells offer a direct humoral response that may target the CNS and lead to tissue specific destruction. Therefore, B cells participate in MS pathogenesis on both sides of the blood-brain barrier.

Early markers are needed to identify children who will show major as well as more subtle neurodevelopmental impairments. Such a challenge could be achieved with the Amiel-Tison Neurological Assessment at Term (ATNAT). Aims; This study assesses the usefulness of the ATNAT in the prediction of developmental problems at two years of corrected age (CA) in infants born between 29 and 37 weeks of gestation. Method: Inclusion criteria were: gestational age between 29(0/7) and 36(6/7) weeks inclusively, birth weight below 2500 g and minimal 24-hour stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Sainte-Justine Hospital. A sample of 147 was prospectively recruited and assessed at two ages: at term with the ATNAT and at 24 months CA with Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II. Results: No major impairment such as cerebral palsy and no neurosensory impairment were observed. Developmental delay defined by an index <70 on the mental or psychomotor scale was reported respectively in 6.2% and 5.4% of the cohort. Significant differences in mental, psychomotor and behavioral performances were found according to neurological status. Neurological status was the only variable to enter the predictive model for psychomotor and behavioral indexes. Gender and neurological status remained in the predictive model for mental performance. Conclusion: This study supports the inclusion of the ATNAT among the eligibility criteria for systematic neurodevelopmental surveillance as it allows early identification of infants at higher risk of low developmental performances at 24 months CA.

Objectives: Our goal was to determine how timing and severity of exposure during pregnancy to objective and subjective stress due to a natural disaster influenced gestation length and fetal growth patterns. Methods: We assessed objective and subjective PNMS levels among 172 women exposed to an ice storm during or shortly before pregnancy. We analyzed associations between PNMS levels and outcomes (gestation length, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and growth ratios), controlling for other variables such as age, obstetric complications, socioeconomic status, and trait anxiety. Results: Gestation lengths and predicted birth weights were shorter among participants exposed to the ice storm during early to mid pregnancy, compared to 3 rd trimester and pre-pregnancy exposure. Birth lengths were shorter in the sample compared to population references, and predicted values were shorter among participants with a "discrepancy" between their objective and subjective PNMS levels. High objective PNMS levels predicted smaller head circumferences in early pregnancy, but we also observed patterns in predicted values of head circumference to birth length ratios suggesting the sparing of brain development relative to birth length among boys in early pregnancy. These sparing effects decreased in later pregnancy. Conclusions: Exposure to stressful events during pregnancy influences birth outcomes independently of other factors. Exposure timing, newborn sex, and the type of stressor influence the effects observed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results from 2 studies found support for an active but also discriminant role of autobiographical memories and their related networked memories on negative emotions. In addition, in line with self-determination theory, thwarting of the psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness was found to be the critical component of autobiographical memory affecting negative emotional experiences. Study 1 revealed that need thwarting in a specific autobiographical memory network related to the theme of loss was positively associated with depressive negative emotions, but not with other negative emotions. Study 2 showed within a prospective design a differential predictive validity between 2 autobiographical memory networks (an anger-related vs. a guilt-related memory) on situational anger reactivity with respect to unfair treatment. All of these results held after controlling for neuroticism (Studies 1 and 2), self-control (Study 2), and for the valence (Study 1) and emotions (Study 2) found in the measured autobiographical memory network. These findings highlight the ongoing emotional significance of representations of need thwarting in autobiographical memory networks.

MRI analysis in temporal lobe epilepsy: Cortical thinning and white matter disruptions are related to side of seizure onset	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; MRI; Diffusion tensor imaging; Cortical thickness	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; FIELD INHOMOGENEITIES; NETWORK ATROPHY; HUMAN BRAIN; TRACTOGRAPHY; ABNORMALITIES; PROGRESSION; REPRODUCIBILITY; VULNERABILITY	Purpose: Past studies reported more widespread structural brain abnormalities in patients with left compared to right temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but the profile of these differences remains unknown. This study investigated the relationship between cortical thinning, white matter compromise, epilepsy variables, and the side of seizure onset, in patients with TLE. Methods: We performed diffusion tensor imaging tractography and cortical thickness analyses of 18 patients with left TLE (LTLE), 18 patients with right TLE (RTLE), and 36 controls. We investigated the relationship among brain structural abnormalities, side of seizure onset, age of seizure onset, and disease duration. Key Findings: Patients with TLE displayed cortical thinning and white matter compromise, predominately on the side ipsilateral to the seizure onset. Relative to RTLE, patients with LTLE showed more widespread abnormalities, particularly in white matter fiber tracts. Greater compromise in white matter integrity was associated with earlier age of seizure onset, whereas cortical thinning was marginally associated with disease duration. Significance: These data support previous findings of LTLE showing greater structural compromise than RTLE, and suggest that mechanisms may not be uniform for gray and white matter compromise in patients with LTLE and RTLE. These results may indicate that LTLE is different from RTLE, possibly due to greater vulnerability of the left hemisphere to early injury and the progressive effects of seizures.

Leukocyte entry into the CNS is nonetheless an early event in multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory disorder of the CNS. Whether BBB dysfunction precedes immune cell infiltration or is the consequence of perivascular leukocyte accumulation remains enigmatic, but leukocyte migration modifies BBB permeability. Immune cells of MS subjects express inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enzymes that can facilitate their migration to the CNS by influencing BBB function, either directly or indirectly. In this review, we describe how immune cells from the peripheral blood overcome the BBB and promote CNS inflammation in MS through BBB disruption.

The control of this class of complex systems is difficult to handle by the traditional controller designs around their operating points. This paper, however, explores the concepts of controller-driven model and virtual unmodeled dynamics to propose a new design framework. The design consists of two controllers with distinct functions. First, using input and output data, a self-tuning controller is constructed based on a linear controller-driven model. Then the output signals of the controller-driven model are compared with the true outputs of the system to produce so-called virtual unmodeled dynamics. Based on the compensator of the virtual unmodeled dynamics, the second controller based on a nonlinear controller-driven model is proposed. Those two controllers are integrated by an adaptive switching control algorithm to take advantage of their complementary features: one offers stabilization function and another provides improved performance. The conditions on the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are analyzed. Both simulation and experimental tests on a heavily coupled nonlinear twin-tank system are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

There is some evidence that the T allele in rs4675690, a single-nucleotide polymorphism near the CREB1 gene, is involved in the modulation of neural responses to negative stimuli. It is not known whether differential brain activity during negative mood state appears early in life in T allele carriers. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain activity, during a transient state of sadness, in children homozygous for the T allele or the C allele. This primary emotion was selected given that it is the prevailing mood in major depressive disorder (MDD). Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal changes were measured while subjects viewed blocks of neutral film excerpts and blocks of sad film excerpts. Results: There was significantly greater BOLD activation in the TT group, compared to the CC group, in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann area [BA 24]), right putamen, right caudate nucleus and left anterior temporal pole (BA 21), when the brain activity associated with the viewing of the emotionally neutral film excerpts was subtracted from that associated with the viewing of the sad film excerpts. Limitations: A replication study using larger samples may be required for more definitive conclusions. Conclusions: The different pattern of regional brain activation found here during transient sadness - in children carrying the T allele, compared to those carrying the C allele - might increase later in life susceptibility to emotional dysregulation and depressive symptoms.

Methods: The children, comprising 136 children (65 boys and 71 girls) of mothers with varying levels of depressive symptomatology, were scanned - using a 1.5-Tesla system - while they watched 5 blocks of both sad and neutral film excerpts. Following scanning, they rated the emotions they experienced, and if they identified sadness, they were also asked to rate its intensity. Results: In children whose mothers exhibited higher depressive symptomatology, compared to children whose mothers displayed lower depressive symptomatology, altered neural responses to sad film excerpts were noted in brain regions known to be involved in sadness and MD, notably the insula, anterior cingulate cortex and caudate nucleus, even though the children did not differ in current mood. Limitations: Whether this represents genetic vulnerability or a consequence of exposure to maternal depressive symptoms at a young age is unknown. Discussion: The results are consistent with the results of studies in healthy adults and MD patients. The present study suggests that an altered pattern of regional brain responses to sad stimuli, is already present in childhood and might represent vulnerability for MD later in life.

To validate a Spanish language version of the Screen for Caregiver Burden, the full-length or long (25-item) and short (seven-item) versions in Mexican caregivers of patients with mixed, vascular and Alzheimer's dementia. Background. Patients with dementia display impaired executive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as behavioural changes and sleep disturbances. These symptoms can make patients become more dependent. The experience of caregiving for patients under these conditions is burdensome. It is important to detect this burden to protect both the caregiver and the patient from negative outcomes. Design. Survey. Methods. Participants were 143 primary caregivers of patients with dementia and 30 caregivers of older adults without dementia in two hospitals in Mexico City. Results. The internal reliability was Cronbach's alpha = 0.89 and 0.82 for the 25-item and the seven-item versions, respectively. The item-total correlations for two Screen for Caregiver Burden versions were significant from r = 0.26 to r = 0.77 p < 0.001. The test-retest was ICC = 0.78 p < 0.001; CI 95% (0.55-0.89) and ICC = 0.72 p < 0.001; CI 95% (0.41-0.86) for the 25-item and the seven-item, respectively. We found from non-significant to highly significant correlations between two Screen for Caregiver Burden versions and other measures ranged. Validity of known groups showed that the caregivers of demented patients experienced more burden than those caring for non-demented patients. Conclusions. Given these psychometric properties, both versions of the Screen for Caregiver Burden are valid tools and can be reliably used to assess the presence and level of caregiver burden in caregivers of demented patients. Relevance to clinical practice. The Screen for Caregiver Burden in the Spanish Language can be used in clinical practice to detect caregiver burden in family members. We recommend using the long or full-length version when the objective is to assess the caregiver burden carefully and the short version (seven-item) as a screening method of caregiver burden that requires attention.

Sparse and dense coding of natural stimuli by distinct midbrain neuron subpopulations in weakly electric fish. J Neurophysiol 106: 3102-3118, 2011. First published September 21, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00588.2011.-While peripheral sensory neurons respond to natural stimuli with a broad range of spatiotemporal frequencies, central neurons instead respond sparsely to specific features in general. The nonlinear transformations leading to this emergent selectivity are not well understood. Here we characterized how the neural representation of stimuli changes across successive brain areas, using the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish as a model system. We found that midbrain torus semicircularis (TS) neurons were on average more selective in their responses than hindbrain electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) neurons. Further analysis revealed two categories of TS neurons: dense coding TS neurons that were ELL-like and sparse coding TS neurons that displayed selective responses. These neurons in general responded to preferred stimuli with few spikes and were mostly silent for other stimuli. We further investigated whether information about stimulus attributes was contained in the activities of ELL and TS neurons. To do so, we used a spike train metric to quantify how well stimuli could be discriminated based on spiking responses. We found that sparse coding TS neurons performed poorly even when their activities were combined compared with ELL and dense coding TS neurons. In contrast, combining the activities of as few as 12 dense coding TS neurons could lead to optimal discrimination. On the other hand, sparse coding TS neurons were better detectors of whether their preferred stimulus occurred compared with either dense coding TS or ELL neurons. Our results therefore suggest that the TS implements parallel detection and estimation of sensory input.

COL4A1 Mutations Associated with a Characteristic Pattern of Intracranial Calcification	NEUROPEDIATRICS			English	Article						intracranial calcification; COL4A1; periventricular leukomalacia	WHITE-MATTER DISORDERS; SMALL-VESSEL DISEASE; COLLAGEN-IV A1; FRONTOPARIETAL POLYMICROGYRIA; INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; CONGENITAL INFECTION; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; HANAC SYNDROME; PSEUDO-TORCH; STROKE	Introduction: Intracranial calcification (ICC) is a relatively common radiological finding in children undergoing investigation for neurological disorders. Many causes are recognised, and ICC is often regarded as a non-specific sign. Methods: From an ongoing study of ICC, we identified 5 patients with characteristic radiological features, in whom a mutation in the COL4A1 gene was found. Results: All patients had CT and MR imaging. MR images demonstrated features of periventricular leukomalacia with irregular dilatation of the lateral ventricles with or without porencephaly, loss of hemispheric white matter volume, and high signal on T(2) and FLAIR sequences within periventricular and deep white matter. Calcification was apparent on MR in 4 patients. CT scans demonstrated spot and linear calcification in the subependymal region and around areas of porencephaly. Calcification was also visible in the deep cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. 1 patient showed calcification in the central pons. Conclusion: ICC occurs in COL4A1-related disease. The radiological features are distinct from other conditions demonstrating recognisable patterns of ICC, such as congenital cytomegalovirus infection and Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome. In the absence of a known risk factor for periventricular leukomalacia, the presence of these radio logical findings should suggest the possibility of COL4A1-related disease.

Materials and methods: Twenty-nine patients with HNSCC were included. CT and PET/CT obtained for treatment planning purposes were reviewed respectively by a neuroradiologist and a nuclear medicine specialist who were blinded to the findings from each other. The attending radiation oncologist together with the neuroradiologist initially defined all gross tumor volume of the primary (GTVp) and the suspicious lymph nodes (GTVn) on CT. Subsequently, the same radiation oncologist and the nuclear medicine specialist defined the GTVp and GTVn on (18)F-FDG-PET/CT. Upon disagreement between CT and (18)F-FDG-PET on the status of a particular lymph node, an ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration was performed. Volumes based on CT and (18)F-FDG-PET were compared with a paired Student's t-test. Results: For the primary disease, four patients had previous diagnostic tonsillectomy and therefore, FDG uptake occurred in 25 patients. For these patients, GTVp contoured on (18)F-FDG-PET (GTVp-PET) were smaller than the GTVp contoured on CT (GTVp-CT) in 80% of the cases, leading to a statistically significant volume difference (p = 0.001). Of the 60 lymph nodes suspicious on PET, 55 were also detected on CT. No volume change was observed (p = 0.08). Ten biopsies were performed for lymph nodes that were discordant between modalities and all were of benign histology. Distant metastases were found in two patients and one had a newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma. Conclusions: GTVp-CT was significantly larger when compared to GTVp-PET. No such change was observed for the lymph nodes. (18)F-FDG-PET modified treatment management in three patients, including two for which no curative radiotherapy was attempted. Larger multicenter studies are needed to ascertain whether combined (18)F-FDG-PET/CT in target delineation can influence the main clinical outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Concerns have been raised with regard to the toxicity of both pre- and postnatal exposures towards the developing nervous system. Although there is an increasing body of literature on the disruption of brain cell functions by certain PBDE congeners in vitro, some challenges have yet to be tackled to enable the translation of in vitro findings into their in vivo counterparts. In this paper, we review findings on the PBDE neurotoxicity in human cells and discuss the research gaps to be addressed. Moreover, we propose a scheme for the incorporation of in vitro data in human risk assessment, namely through (i) the determination of in vitro cell benchmark levels; (ii) the consideration of uncertainties in establishing equivalency between the in vitro and the in vivo tissue benchmark levels (e.g., chronic vs. acute exposure, interactions with other chemicals); and (iii) relating tissue benchmark levels to surrogate levels of internal exposure. Alongside the assessment of brain dosimetry following exposure to PBDEs, in vitro neurotoxicity data provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the risks of prenatal and early life exposures on children neurodevelopment.

Biomarkers of Methylmercury Exposure Immunotoxicity among Fish Consumers in Amazonian Brazil	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						autoantibodies; cytokine; immune response; mercury; selenium	MERCURY EXPOSURE; ICP-MS; INORGANIC MERCURY; ORGANIC MERCURY; HAIR MERCURY; RIVER-BASIN; BLOOD; CONSUMPTION; SELENIUM; PLASMA	BACKGROUND: Mercury (Hg) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant with neurodevelopmental and immune system effects. An informative biomarker of Hg-induced immunotoxicity could aid studies on the potential contribution to immune-related health effects. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to test the hypothesis that methylmercury (MeHg) exposures affect levels of serum biomarkers and to examine interactions between Hg and selenium (Se) in terms of these responses. METHODS: This cross-sectional epidemiological study assessed adults living along the Tapajos River, a system long affected by MeHg. We measured antinuclear (ANA) and antinucleolar (ANoA) autoantibody levels and eight cytolcines in serum samples (n = 232). Total Hg (including MeHg) and Se were measured in blood, plasma, hair, and urine. RESULTS: The median (range) total Hg concentrations were 14.1 mu g/g (1.1-62.4), 53.5 mu g/L (4.3-288.9), 8.8 mu g/L (0.2-40), and 3.0 mu g/L (0.2-16.1) for hair, blood, plasma, and urine, respectively. Elevated titers of ANA (but not ANoA) were positively associated with MeHg exposure (log-transformed, for blood and plasma), unadjusted [odds ratio (OR) = 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 6.2] and adjusted for sex and age (OR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.1, 7.5). Proinflammatory [interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-gamma], anti-inflammatory (IL-4), and IL-17 cytokine levels were increased with MeHg exposure; however, in the subset of the population with elevated ANA, proinflammatory IL-1 beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and anti-inflammatory (IL-4) cytokine levels were decreased with MeHg exposure. Although Se status was associated with MeHg level (correlation coefficient = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.29, 1.43), Se status was not associated with any changes in ANA and did not modify associations between Hg and ANA titers. CONCLUSIONS: MeHg exposure was associated with an increased ANA and changes in serum cytokine profile. Moreover, alterations in serum cytokine profiles differed based on ANA response, suggesting a specific phenotype of MeHg susceptibility. Further research on the potential health implications of these observed immunological changes is warranted.

We reviewed the results of genetic studies investigating associations between putative susceptibility genes for ADHD and neuropsychological traits relevant for this disorder. A PubMed database search identified 47 studies. Most of them (n = 36) examined a single candidate gene, while seven studies examined two or three genes and only four studies examined 10 genes or more. The most investigated genes were DRD4, DAT1, COMT, MAOA, and DBH. Regarding DRD4, association of high reaction time variability with the 7-R allele absence appears to be the most consistent result. Speed of processing, set shifting, and cognitive impulsiveness were less frequently investigated, but seem to be altered in the 7-R allele carriers. Regarding DAT1, majority of studies reported negative results indicating that this gene may have a modulating effect rather than direct influence on cognitive functioning. The other genes were investigated in fewer studies, and the reported findings need to be replicated. The principal methodological issues that could represent confounding factors and may explain conflicting results are discussed.

Sensorimotor integration for speech motor learning involves the inferior parietal cortex	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						human; rTMS; sensorimotor adaptation; speech production	PRISM ADAPTATION; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; BRAIN ACTIVATION; PREMOTOR CORTEX; VERBAL FEEDBACK; OVERT SPEECH; FMRI; CEREBELLUM; PLASTICITY; REPRESENTATIONS	Sensorimotor integration is important for motor learning. The inferior parietal lobe, through its connections with the frontal lobe and cerebellum, has been associated with multisensory integration and sensorimotor adaptation for motor behaviors other than speech. In the present study, the contribution of the inferior parietal cortex to speech motor learning was evaluated using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) prior to a speech motor adaptation task. Subjects auditory feedback was altered in a manner consistent with the auditory consequences of an unintended change in tongue position during speech production, and adaptation performance was used to evaluate sensorimotor plasticity and short-term learning. Prior to the feedback alteration, rTMS or sham stimulation was applied over the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Subjects who underwent the sham stimulation exhibited a robust adaptive response to the feedback alteration whereas subjects who underwent rTMS exhibited a diminished adaptive response. The results suggest that the inferior parietal region, in and around SMG, plays a role in sensorimotor adaptation for speech. The interconnections of the inferior parietal cortex with inferior frontal cortex, cerebellum and primary sensory areas suggest that this region may be an important component in learning and adapting sensorimotor patterns for speech.

J	Desjardins, C; Chaib-draa, B				Desjardins, Charles; Chaib-draa, Brahim			Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: A Reinforcement Learning Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Autonomous vehicle control; cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC); neural networks; policy-gradient algorithms; reinforcement learning (RL)	POLICY-GRADIENT ESTIMATION/; INFINITE-HORIZON; FUZZY CONTROL; MANEUVERS; SYSTEMS	Recently, improvements in sensing, communicating, and computing technologies have led to the development of driver-assistance systems (DASs). Such systems aim at helping drivers by either providing a warning to reduce crashes or doing some of the control tasks to relieve a driver from repetitive and boring tasks. Thus, for example, adaptive cruise control (ACC) aims at relieving a driver from manually adjusting his/her speed to maintain a constant speed or a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him/her. Currently, ACC can be improved through vehicle-to-vehicle communication, where the current speed and acceleration of a vehicle can be transmitted to the following vehicles by intervehicle communication. This way, vehicle-to-vehicle communication with ACC can be combined in one single system called cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC). This paper investigates CACC by proposing a novel approach for the design of autonomous vehicle controllers based on modern machine-learning techniques. More specifically, this paper shows how a reinforcement-learning approach can be used to develop controllers for the secure longitudinal following of a front vehicle. This approach uses function approximation techniques along with gradient-descent learning algorithms as a means of directly modifying a control policy to optimize its performance. The experimental results, through simulation, show that this design approach can result in efficient behavior for CACC.

The aim of the present study was to provide additional evidence that OLE acts as an anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant mediator in Pb exposed rats. 4-weeks old Wistar rats were exposed or not to 250 mg/l Pb for 13-weeks and then exposed to tap water containing or not 0.1% OLE for additional 2-weeks. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry showed significantly elevated Pb levels in the hippocampus and serum and reaches 5 and 42 mu g/mg tissue, respectively. In the hippocampus, the examination of markers of apoptosis and inflammation revealed an increase in caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta and prostaglandin E2 in Pb-exposed rats. In addition, our findings showed that Pb induced 4-hydroxynonenal production and inhibited antioxidant-related enzyme activity, such as glutathione-S-transferase as wells as energy metabolism-related enzyme activity, such as NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase and glucose transporter. Upon examination of signaling pathways involved in apoptosis process, we found that Pb induced p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt phosphorylation, but in contrast, inhibited that of ERK1/2. Interestingly, OLE administration diminished tissue Pb deposition and prevented all Pb effects. In the frontal cortex, our data also showed that OLE-abolished Pb-induced caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Collectively, these data support the use of OLE by traditional medicine to counter Pb neurotoxicity.

In this study we used a unique approach for targeted, single-copy transgene insertion to generate transgenic mice carrying a Mthfr upstream or Mthfr downstream promoter-reporter construct located 5' to the endogenous Hprt (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) locus. The Mthfr downstream promoter demonstrated activity in the neural tube, neural crest cells, dorsal root ganglia, heart, and endothelial cells of blood vessels in 10.5-days post coitum embryos and placentas. Upstream promoter activity was absent at this developmental stage. Postnatally, both promoters demonstrated activity in the brain stem, hippocampus, and thalamus of 1-week-old brain that became stronger in the adult. The Mthfr upstream promoter also showed activity in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Both promoters were active in male reproductive tissues, including 1-week-old epididymides, and there was upstream promoter-specific activity in the adult testis. Our investigation of Mthfr regulation in an in vivo mouse model revealed temporal- and tissue-specific regulation that supports important roles for MTHFR in the developing embryo, and in postnatal brain and male reproductive tissues.

However, difficulties in clinical translation suggest that improving the "know how" demands that we improve our fundamental knowledge on mechanisms that regulate NSC transplantation outcome. In this article, we will focus on recent works conducted in our laboratory and by others supporting the fact that the sex of NSCs (the donor) may be a determining factor in the outcome of NSCs grafts. In particular, we will discuss the intrinsic sexual dimorphism recently reported in NSCs showing a differential expression of estrogen receptor alpha and beta as well as aromatase and how it affected NSCs transplantation outcome. An emphasis will be put on the importance of taking such sexual dimorphism into consideration for the design of future brain repair strategies.

Neurofeedback for Insomnia: A Pilot Study of Z-Score SMR and Individualized Protocols	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Z-Score; EEG; Sleep; Insomnia; QEEG; SMR; Biofeedback	SLEEP QUALITY INDEX; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGIC INSOMNIA; SENSORIMOTOR RHYTHM; EEG BIOFEEDBACK; ACTIGRAPHY; VALIDATION; DISORDERS; VALIDITY; SCALE	Insomnia is an epidemic in the US. Neurofeedback (NFB) is a little used, psychophysiological treatment with demonstrated usefulness for treating insomnia. Our objective was to assess whether two distinct Z-Score NFB protocols, a modified sensorimotor (SMR) protocol and a sequential, quantitative EEG (sQEEG)-guided, individually designed (IND) protocol, would alleviate sleep and associated daytime dysfunctions of participants with insomnia. Both protocols used instantaneous Z scores to determine reward condition administered when awake. Twelve adults with insomnia, free of other mental and uncontrolled physical illnesses, were randomly assigned to the SMR or IND group. Eight completed this randomized, parallel group, single-blind study. Both groups received fifteen 20-min sessions of Z-Score NFB. Pre-post assessments included sQEEG, mental health, quality of life, and insomnia status. ANOVA yielded significant post-treatment improvement for the combined group on all primary insomnia scores: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI p < .005), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI p < .0001), PSQI Sleep Efficiency (p < .007), and Quality of Life Inventory (p < .02). Binomial tests of baseline EEGs indicated a significant proportion of excessively high levels of Delta and Beta power (p < .001) which were lowered post-treatment (paired z-tests p < .001). Baseline EEGs showed excessive sleepiness and hyperarousal, which improved post-treatment. Both Z-Score NFB groups improved in sleep and daytime functioning. Post-treatment, all participants were normal sleepers. Because there were no significant differences in the findings between the two groups, our future large scale studies will utilize the less burdensome to administer Z-Score SMR protocol.

We describe a case of multilingual lexical-gustatory synesthesia for whom some synesthesias were bidirectional as some tastes also triggered auditory word associations. Evoked concurrents could be gustatory but also tactile sensations. In addition to words and pseudowords, many voices were effective inducers, suggesting increased connections between cortical taste areas and both voice-selective and language-selective areas. Lasting changes in some evoked tastes occurred during childhood suggesting that some plasticity can be present after the initial learning of associations. Inducers were often linked to taste concurrents phonologically or semantically, but also through identifiable childhood episodes (persons or events). Several inducers were phonologically linked to episodic inducers suggesting a process of secondary acquisition for many inducers. Implications of these observations are discussed.

Functional deficits in peripheral nerve mitochondria in rats with paclitaxel- and oxaliplatin-evoked painful peripheral neuropathy	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Acetyl-L-carnitine; Bioenergetics; Mitotoxicity; Neuropathic pain; Sensory neuropathy	ACETYL-L-CARNITINE; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; PERMEABILITY TRANSITION; PROTEASOME INHIBITOR; MUSCLE MITOCHONDRIA; OXIME TRO19622; CELLS; NEUROTOXICITY; FIBER; CISPLATIN	Cancer chemotherapeutics like paclitaxel and oxaliplatin produce a dose-limiting chronic sensory peripheral neuropathy that is often accompanied by neuropathic pain. The cause of the neuropathy and pain is unknown. In animal models, paclitaxel-evoked and oxaliplatin-evoked painful peripheral neuropathies are accompanied by an increase in the incidence of swollen and vacuolated mitochondria in peripheral nerve axons. It has been proposed that mitochondrial swelling and vacuolation are indicative of a functional impairment and that this results in a chronic axonal energy deficiency that is the cause of the neuropathy's symptoms. However, the significance of mitochondrial swelling and vacuolation is ambiguous and a test of the hypothesis requires a direct assessment of the effects of chemotherapy on mitochondrial function. The results of such an assessment are reported here. Mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were measured in rat sciatic nerve samples taken 1-2 days after and 3-4 weeks after induction of painful peripheral neuropathy with paclitaxel and oxaliplatin. Significant deficits in Complex l-mediated and Complex II-mediated respiration and significant deficits in ATP production were found for both drugs at both time points. In addition, prophylactic treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine, which inhibited the development of paclitaxel-evoked and oxaliplatin-evoked neuropathy, prevented the deficits in mitochondrial function. These results implicate mitotoxicity as a possible cause of chemotherapy-evoked chronic sensory peripheral neuropathy. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we analyzed the role of one core PCP gene PRICKLE1 in these malformations. We screened this gene in 810 unrelated NTD patients and identified seven rare missense heterozygous mutations that were absent in all controls analyzed and predicted to be functionally deleterious using bioinformatics. Functional validation of five PRICKLE1 variants in a zebrafish model demonstrated that one variant, p.Arg682Cys, antagonized the CE phenotype induced by the wild-type zebrafish prickle1a (zpk1a) in a dominant fashion. Our study demonstrates that PRICKLE1 could act as a predisposing factor to human NTDs and further expands our knowledge of the role of PCP genes in the pathogenesis of these malformations. 32:13711375, 2011.

Forty different heterozygous germline DICER1 mutations have been reported worldwide in 42 probands that developed as children or young adults, pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), cystic nephroma (CN), ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors (especially Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor [SLCT]), and/or multinodular goiter (MNG). We report DICER1 mutations in seven additional families that manifested uterine cervix embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (cERMS, four cases) and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (cPNET, one case), Wilms tumor (WT, three cases), pulmonary sequestration (PS, one case), and juvenile intestinal polyp (one case). One carrier developed (age 25 years) a pleomorphic sarcoma of the thigh; another carrier had transposition of great arteries (TGA). These observations show that cERMS, cPNET, WT, PS, and juvenile polyps fall within the spectrum of DICER1-related diseases. DICER1 appears to be the first gene implicated in the etiology of cERMS, cPNET, and PS. Young adulthood sarcomas and perhaps congenital malformations such as TGA may also be associated. 32:13811384, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We have previously reported that both acute food deprivation (FD) and NPY injections can reinstate extinguished drug-seeking behavior, a proposed animal model of relapse to drug abuse. However, it is not clear whether the FD effect on drug seeking is dependent on NPY transmission. Here, we used the reinstatement model to assess the role of NPY Y1 and Y5-receptor-mediated transmission in FD-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Methods Rats were trained to self-administer heroin for 10-12 days (0.1 mg/kg/infusion/intravenous). Animals then underwent extinction training followed by drug-seeking reinstatement tests under 21 h of FD and sated conditions. Results Injections of a novel NPY Y5-receptor antagonist, Lu AA33810 (0.0, 1.0, or 30.0 mg/kg/IP), resulted in a significant attenuation of FD-induced reinstatement of extinguished heroin seeking. However, no significant effects on reinstatement were found for the Y1-receptor antagonist, BIBO 3304 (0.0, 5.0, or 10.0 nmol/intracerebroventricular). Conclusions These results suggest that while signals mediated through NPY Y1 receptors play a modest role in reinstatement, activation of Y5 receptors has a critical function in FD-induced reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior.

METHOD This is a case-control study of children diagnosed with isolated CBMs. Each child was matched on age and sex to two typically developing children. Using advanced three-dimensional volumetric magnetic resonance imaging, the cerebrum was segmented into tissue classes and partitioned into eight regions. Analysis of variance was used to compare cerebral volumes between children with CBMs and control children, and linear regressions to examine the impact of cerebellar volume reduction on cerebral volumes. RESULTS Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at amean age of 27 months in 20 children (10 males, 10 females) with CBMs and 40 typically developing children. Children with CBMs showed significantly smaller deep grey matter nuclei (p< 0.001), subgenual white matter (p= 0.03), midtemporal whitematter (p= 0.02), and inferior occipital greymatter (p= 0.03) volumes than typically developing children. Greater cerebellar volumetric reduction in children with CBMs was associated with decreased total cerebral volume and deep grey matter nuclei (p= 0.02), subgenual white / grey matter (p= 0.001), midtemporal white (p= 0.02) and greymatter (p= 0.01), and parieto-occipital greymatter (p= 0.004). INTERPRETATION CBMs are associated with impaired regional cerebral growth, suggesting deactivation of principal cerebello-cerebral pathways.

However, little research exists with MF exposures comparable to the highest levels experienced in occupations like power line workers and industrial welders. This research aims to evaluate the impact of a 60 Hz, 3 mT MF on human cognitive performance. Ninety-nine participants completed the double-blind protocol, performing a selection of psychometric tests under two consecutive MF exposure conditions dictated by assignment to one of three groups (sham/sham, MF exposure/sham, or sham/MF exposure). Data were analyzed using a 3 x 2 mixed model analysis of variance. Performance between repetitions improved in 11 of 15 psychometric parameters (practice effect). A significant interaction effect on the digit span forward test (F - 5.21, P < 0.05) revealed an absence of practice effects for both exposure groups but not the control group. This memory test indicates MF-induced abolition of the improvement associated with practice. Overall, this study does not establish any clear MF effect on human cognition. It is speculated that an ELF MF may interfere with the neuropsychological processes responsible for this short-term learning effect supported by brain synaptic plasticity.

Method: This study tested 27 adults with moderate or severe TBI and 27 controls matched for age, sex and education on the budgeting task of the IADL Profile. The budgeting task is a complex real-world problem involving the preparation of a yearly budget for an individual living on a fixed income with the goal of saving money to purchase a car. Main results: The results showed that TBI subjects, the majority of whom had documented frontal lesions and/or diffuse axonal injury based on CT scan reports, were more likely than control subjects to experience difficulties on all task-related operations (planning, carrying out and verifying attainment of goal), with planning being particularly affected. These deficits were shown to impact on financial abilities, an issue of particular concern for TBI individuals reporting full responsibility of their finances. Conclusions: The budgeting task of the IADL Profile discriminates TBI subjects from controls. Planning was shown to be the most significant difficulty underlying reduced independence in the task.

Yet, the role of voice-sensitive regions in representing voice identity remains unclear. Using a functional magnetic resonance adaptation design, we aimed at disentangling acoustic- from identity-based representations of voices. Sixteen participants were scanned while listening to pairs of voices drawn from morphed continua between 2 initially unfamiliar voices, before and after a voice learning phase. In a given pair, the first and second stimuli could be identical or acoustically different and, at the second session, perceptually similar or different. At both sessions, right mid-STS/superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal pole (sTP) showed sensitivity to acoustical changes. Critically, voice learning induced changes in the acoustical processing of voices in inferior frontal cortices (IFCs). At the second session only, right IFC and left cingulate gyrus showed sensitivity to changes in perceived identity. The processing of voice identity appears to be subserved by a large network of brain areas ranging from the sTP, involved in an acoustic-based representation of unfamiliar voices, to areas along the convexity of the IFC for identity-related processing of familiar voices.

Human vision with a lesion of the parvocellular pathway: an optic neuritis model for selective contrast sensitivity deficits with severe loss of midget ganglion cell function	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Parvocellular; Magnocellular; Optic neuritis; Contrast sensitivity; Color vision; L/M cone opponency; Spatial frequency; Temporal frequency; Retina; LGN	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE VISUAL-SYSTEM; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; COLOR-OPPONENT; DETECTION MECHANISMS; CHROMATIC GRATINGS; PARALLEL PATHWAYS; TREATMENT TRIAL; PRIMATE RETINA; RED-GREEN	Achromatic visual function in primates is distributed between two pathways from retina to cortex, the parvocellular and the magnocellular. The relative contribution of these to human achromatic vision is controversial and largely unknown. Here, we use an optic neuritis (ON) model to investigate the effects of a severe loss of parvocellular function on human contrast sensitivity. In our first experiment, we use Gabor stimuli (0.5 cpd, 2 Hz) to show that, compared to normal control eyes, ON causes selective deficits in the two chromatic, cone opponent pathways, with L/M cone opponency affected more than S cone opponency, and a relative sparing of achromatic function. Since L/M cone opponency is carried exclusively by the midget ganglion cells of the parvocellular pathway, this demonstrates a selective deficit of parvocellular function. In a second experiment, we report on two subjects who have lost all L/M cone opponent response in both eyes, indicating a severe loss of parvocellular function. We measure the spatial and temporal contrast sensitivity functions of their remaining achromatic vision, compared with a normal control group, to determine the selectivity of the visual deficit caused by the differential parvocellular loss, and assess the relative contributions of the parvocellular and magnocellular pathways to achromatic contrast sensitivity. We find that parvocellular function contributes selectively at mid- to high spatial frequencies (at low temporal frequencies), whereas magnocellular function determines contrast sensitivity over a very broad temporal frequency range (at low spatial frequencies). Our data bear a striking resemblance to results obtained from primate parvocellular lesions.

Se deficiency has been associated with both cognitive and neuromotor impairment, while sensory and motor deficits have been attributed to excess Se. In the Lower Tapajos Region of the Brazilian Amazon, riverside populations present a wide range of Se levels. These fish-eating communities have among the highest mercury (Hg) exposures reported in the world today, and recently, lead (Pb) exposure has been identified. Some studies suggest that Se intake can be protective for Hg and/or Pb toxicity, however, data from animal and human studies are inconsistent. The objective of the present study was to examine the relations between biomarkers of Se and motor functions, taking into account co-variables and biomarkers of exposure to Hg and Pb. Participants (n = 448), aged 15-87y, were recruited from 12 communities along the Tapajos River. Se concentrations were measured in whole blood (B-Se), plasma (P-Se), hair (H-Se) and urine (U-Se) by ICP-MS. Whole blood Hg (B-Hg) and Pb (B-Pb) were also measured by ICP-MS. Interview-administered questionnaires served to collect information on socio-demographics and medical history. All participants underwent a complete visual examination and performed tests of motor functions (Branches Alternate Movement Task, Santa Ana Test, Dynamometer and Grooved Pegboard Test). B-Se varied from 103 to 1500 mu g/L (median 228 mu g/L), P-Se from 53.6 to 913 mu g/L (median 135 mu g/L), H-Se from 0.4 to 3.8 mu g/g (median 0.7 mu g/g) and U-Se from 2.3 to 1375 mu g/g cr. (median 33.6 mu g/g Cr.). Median B-Hg and B-Pb levels were 42.5 mu g/L and 113 mu g/L respectively. In multivariable analysis, Se biomarkers (log-transformed) were positively related to better performance on all motor tests, taking into account socio-demographic co-variables and B-Hg and B-Pb levels. P-Se consistently showed stronger associations to motor performance compared to the other Se biomarkers. Regression estimates for Se biomarkers were considerably stronger when controlling for B-Hg. When stratifying at the median for B-Hg concentrations, P-Se consistently presented associations with the outcomes only at high B-Hg concentrations. This is the first human study to report beneficial effects of high Se status on motor functions. For this population with elevated Hg exposure, high dietary Se intake may be critical for brain and muscle functions. However, these findings are not necessarily applicable to populations with lower Hg exposure and/or Se status, which is the case for people who do not rely heavily on fish consumption, be they in Brazil, the United States or elsewhere. The associations were mostly observed with P-Se, suggesting that P-Se or plasma selenoproteins may be good biomarkers for these outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Analysis and Design of Tunable Amplifiers for Implantable Neural Recording Applications	IEEE JOURNAL ON EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Biomedical sensor interface; neural recording; pseudo resistor; tunability		In this paper, an in-depth design methodology for fully-integrated tunable low-noise amplifiers for neural recording applications is presented. In this methodology, a modified system design is proposed to optimize the area/noise/linearity performance. A novel linear pseudo-resistor with a wide range of tunability is also proposed. As a case study, a low-noise tunable and reconfigurable amplifier for neural recording applications is designed and simulated in a 0.18 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process in all process corners. Simulated characteristics of the amplifier include tunable gain of 54 dB, tunable high-cutoff frequency of 10 kHz, programmable low-cutoff frequency ranging from 4 to 300 Hz, and power consumption of 20.8 mu W at 1.8 V. According to postlayout simulations, integrated input-referred noise of the amplifier is 2.6 mu V (rms) and 2.38 mu V (rms) over the 0.5 Hz-50 kHz frequency range for low-cutoff frequency of 4 and 300 Hz, respectively. The amplifier also provides output voltage swing of 1 VP-P with total harmonic distortion of -46.24 dB at 300 Hz, and -45.97 dB at 10 kHz.

The proposed algorithm combines the advantages associated with voltage-window count-based and event-based threshold-voltage detections. The result is an algorithm that is more tolerant to noise, dc offsets, baseline energy variations, and seconds-long nonseizure related sharp activities. In addition, only one parameter (one threshold voltage) needs to be optimized per patient, and for that, only one seizure per patient is used for training, making the process of optimizing the patient-specific detector a simple task. The time evaluation period when counting is performed is kept constant across all patients studied, and is fixed at 5 s in this work. A novel dual path digital signal processing unit in the back-end of the detector is included and is shown to decrease the detection latency by 14%. Experimental results on a printed circuit board using commercially available discrete components confirm the correct functionality of the proposed detector. The proposed algorithm achieves 100% sensitivity, 10.7 s average detection delay, and a single false alarm when evaluated on a total of 25 seizures and 24 nonseizure datasets of intracerebral electroencephalographic (icEEG) recordings from five patients from the epilepsy monitoring unit of Notre-Dame Hospital in Montreal. In addition, monolithic integration of the overall system, including bio-amplification and comparison, is also carried out in a TSMC 0.18-mu m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. Simulations show that a static power dissipation of 7, 99% of which is consumed by the front-end bio-amplifier, is achieved, showing the potential of using the proposed seizure detector in a closed-loop brain-prosthesis device interface for seizure control and treatment.

The actions of others serve as valuable social stimuli in this respect, offering the observer an insight into the actor's emotional state. Social cognition continues to mature throughout adolescence. Here we assess longitudinally the development of functional connectivity during early adolescence within two neural networks implicated in social cognition: one network of brain regions consistently engaged during action observation and another one associated with mentalizing. Using fMRI, we reveal a greater recruitment of the social-emotional network during the observation of angry hand actions in male relative to female adolescents. These findings are discussed in terms of known sex differences in adolescent social behavior.

Neural Correlates of Subsecond Time Distortion in the Middle Temporal Area of Visual Cortex	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TERM MOTION ADAPTATION; SUBJECTIVE DURATION; PERCEIVED DURATION; MT; MACAQUE; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; STIMULUS; NEURONS	How does the brain represent the passage of time at the subsecond scale? Although different conceptual models for time perception have been proposed, its neurophysiological basis remains unknown. We took advantage of a visual duration illusion produced by stimulus novelty to link changes in cortical activity in monkeys with distortions of duration perception in humans. We found that human subjects perceived the duration of a subsecond motion pulse with a novel direction longer than a motion pulse with a repeated direction. Recording from monkeys viewing identical motion stimuli but performing a different behavioral task, we found that both the duration and amplitude of the neural response in the middle temporal area of visual cortex were positively correlated with the degree of novelty of the motion direction. In contrast to previous accounts that attribute distortions in duration perception to changes in the speed of a putative internal clock, our results suggest that the known adaptive properties of neural activity in visual cortex contributes to subsecond temporal distortions.

The M1/M4 preferring agonist xanomeline is analgesic in rodent models of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain via central site of action	PAIN			English	Article						Xanomeline; Supraspinal; Neuropathic; Inflammatory; MT-7; MT-3	MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; NUCLEUS RAPHE MAGNUS; ROSTRAL VENTROLATERAL MEDULLA; RAT SPINAL-CORD; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; KNOCKOUT MICE; INDUCED ANTINOCICEPTION; VENTROMEDIAL MEDULLA; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; M-1 RECEPTORS	The role of muscarinic receptor subtype-1 (M1) in chronic pain is unclear. In an attempt to gain an understanding of its role, we have tested xanomeline, an M1/M4-preferring agonist, together with nonselective (scopolamine and pirenzepine), and selective (MT-7 and MT-3) muscarinic receptor (M1 and M4, respectively) antagonists in a number of inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Xanomeline potently and effectively reversed tactile allodynia and heat hyperalgesia associated with established neuropathic and inflammatory pain in both rat and mouse models. Scopolamine and pirenzepine completely blocked the analgesic response to xanomeline, confirming that the analgesic effect is mediated by the muscarinic system. The highly selective M1 receptor toxin, MT-7, almost completely abolished the analgesic response to xanomeline when administered supraspinally. However, the highly selective M4 receptor toxin, MT-3, only marginally reversed the analgesia when given supraspinally, and had no effect when given spinally. In conclusion, the data presented show that the nonselective muscarinic agonist xanomeline is analgesic in models of persistent pain and suggest that the activation of supraspinal M1 receptors, and to a lesser extent supraspinal M4 receptors, contributes to that analgesia.

The fine neuroanatomy of astrocytes, however, remains to be investigated in these psychiatric conditions. In this study, we performed a detailed morphometric analysis of 3D-reconstructed gray and white matter astrocytes in Golgi-impregnated anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) samples from depressed suicides and matched controls. Postmortem ACC samples (BA24) from 10 well-characterized depressed suicides and 10 matched sudden-death controls were obtained from the Quebec Suicide Brain Bank. Golgi-impregnated protoplasmic astrocytes (gray matter, layer VI) and fibrous astrocytes (adjacent white matter) were reconstructed, and their morphometric features were analyzed using the Neurolucida software. For each cell, the soma size as well as the number, length, and branching of processes were determined. The densities of thorny protrusions found along the processes of both astrocytic subtypes were also determined. Protoplasmic astrocytes showed no significant difference between groups for any of the quantified parameters. However, fibrous astrocytes had significantly larger cell bodies, as well as longer, more ramified processes in depressed suicides, with values for these parameters being about twice as high as those measured in controls. These results provide the first evidence of altered cortical astrocytic morphology in mood disorders. The presence of hypertrophic astrocytes in BA24 white matter is consistent with reports suggesting white matter alterations in depression, and provides further support to the neuroinflammatory theory of depression.

Vigabatrin therapy for infantile spasms: review of major trials in Europe, Canada, and the United States; and recommendations for dosing	ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Review						clinical trials; epilepsy; infantile spasms; review; vigabatrin; West syndrome	MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; WEST-SYNDROME; COMPARING VIGABATRIN; EPILEPSY OUTCOMES; AGE; ACTH; MONOTHERAPY; LONG; LINE	Infantile spasms (IS) are a unique and severe form of epilepsy associated with poor neurologic and developmental outcomes. The refractory spasms and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns associated with the condition are believed to have a progressively detrimental impact. Therefore, rapid and complete control of spasms is the primary goal of treatment. Well-controlled clinical trials in Europe, Canada, and the United States have demonstrated that vigabatrin is efficacious and generally well-tolerated as monotherapy for IS. Several key studies, including pivotal trials that led to United States approval of vigabatrin in 2009, as well as comparative trials of vigabatrin and hormonal treatment, are the focus of this review. All studies assessed spasm cessation - usually as the primary endpoint - and adverse events. Vigabatrin dosages generally ranging from 100 to 150 mg/kg/day demonstrated efficacy to decrease or eradicate spasms and eliminate hypsarrhythmic EEG in patients with newly diagnosed IS. Several studies demonstrated long-term sustainability of spasm freedom with no negative impact on developmental outcomes. Vigabatrin was generally well-tolerated with few severe adverse events. Visual field defects cannot be adequately assessed in infants and young children, so this potential adverse effect was not evaluated in children with spasms. Notably, the time to response with vigabatrin was very rapid, generally occurring within 2 weeks of initial treatment. This allows for early treatment modification as needed. For infants who respond well to vigabatrin, treatment duration up to 6 months appears to be appropriate for realizing spasm freedom while limiting potential risks of adverse events and recurrences.

Although neuromodulation by dopamine and noradrenaline in the cortex is known to be important for proper cognitive function, little is known on how cortical noradrenergic and dopaminergic presynaptic boutons are affected in normal aging. Using rats we investigated whether these two neurotransmitter systems undergo structural reorganization in aging, and if these changes correlated with cognitive loss. Young and aged rats were tested for cognitive performance using the Morris water maze. Following the behavioral characterization, the animals were sacrificed and the cortical tissue was processed for immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) to detect and discriminate noradrenergic and dopaminergic varicosities. We observed a significant increase in dopaminergic varicosities in lamina V of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of aged cognitively unimpaired rats when compared to young and aged-impaired animals. In laminae II and III of the ACC, we observed a significant decrease of dopaminergic varicosities in aged-impaired animals when compared to young or aged cognitively unimpaired animals. Changes in noradrenergic varicosities never reached statistical significance in any group or brain region. The data suggests that the remodeling of mesocortical dopaminergic fibers may participate in age-associated cognitive decline. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Despite the implicit assumption that clinicians can discriminate individuals with executive function deficits from healthy controls, investigating the validity of this assumption is critical to informed treatment plans. A convenience sample of 90 occupational therapists and neuropsychologists were recruited. Clinicians analyzed 27 one- to three-minute video clips illustrating errors made during the Baycrest Multiple Errands Test (Dawson et al., 2009). The clinicians indicated whether each error had been committed by a person with or without neurological impairment. Clinicians attributed only 15 of the 27 errors (55.6%) to the correct population at a proportion significantly different than chance (p < .05). Therapists should be cautious when interpreting single errors observed in individuals with cognitive deficits.

However, it is not clear whether the effects of speech degradation by vocoding are related to acoustical degradation or by the associated loss in intelligibility. Using vocoding and a parametric variation of the number of frequency bands used for the encoding, we investigated the effects of the degradation of auditory spectral content on cerebral processing of intelligible speech (words), unintelligible speech (words in a foreign language), and complex environmental sounds. Results: Vocoding was found to decrease activity to a comparable degree for intelligible and unintelligible speech in most of the temporal lobe. Only the bilateral posterior temporal areas showed a significant interaction between vocoding and intelligibility, with a stronger vocoding-induced decrease in activity for intelligible speech. Comparisons to responses elicited by environmental sounds showed that portions of the temporal voice areas (TVA) retained their greater responses to voice even under adverse listening conditions. The recruitment of specific networks in temporal regions during exposure to degraded speech follows a radial and anterior-posterior topography compared to the networks recruited by exposure to speech that is not degraded. Conclusions: Different brain networks are involved in vocoded sound processing of intelligible speech, unintelligible speech, and non-vocal sounds. The greatest differences are between speech	[Strelnikov, Kuzma; Massida, Zoe; Barone, Pascal] Univ Toulouse 3, Univ Toulouse, Ctr Rech Cerveau & Cognit, F-31062 Toulouse, France; [Strelnikov, Kuzma; Massida, Zoe; Barone, Pascal] Hop Purpan, CNRS, UMR 5549, Toulouse, France; [Strelnikov, Kuzma] CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France; [Rouger, Julien; Belin, Pascal] Univ Glasgow, Ctr Cognit NeuroImaging CCNi, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Rouger, Julien; Belin, Pascal] Univ Glasgow, Inst Neurosci & Psychol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Belin, Pascal] Univ Montreal, Int Labs Brain Mus & Sound, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Belin, Pascal] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rouger, Julien] Brain Innovat BV, Maastricht, Netherlands	Strelnikov, K (reprint author), Univ Toulouse 3, Univ Toulouse, Ctr Rech Cerveau & Cognit, F-31062 Toulouse, France.	kuzma@cerco.ups-tlse.fr	Barone, Pascal/A-4008-2009; Imhof, Margarete/F-8471-2011; Belin, Pascal/C-6247-2009	Belin, Pascal/0000-0002-7578-6365	ANR Hearing Loss [ANR-06-Neuro-021-04]; Cifre Convention [Cochlear France SAS-ANRT No979/2006]; PHRC interregional CHU Purpan [API2009]; Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale [BBSRC BB/E003958/1]	ANR Hearing Loss (ANR-06-Neuro-021-04) (P.

Attentional Modulation of Neuromagnetic Evoked Responses in Early Human Visual Cortex and Parietal Lobe following a Rank-Order Rule	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SPATIAL SELECTIVE ATTENTION; HUMAN AREA MT; NEURAL MECHANISMS; TOP-DOWN; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; CORTICAL NETWORK; TASK-DIFFICULTY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FILTERED MEG; COLOR-CENTER	Top-down voluntary attention modulates the amplitude of magnetic evoked fields in the human visual cortex. Whether such modulation is flexible enough to adapt to the demands of complex tasks in which abstract rules must be applied to select a target in the presence of distracters remains unclear. We recorded brain neuromagnetic activity using whole-head magnetoencephalography in 14 human subjects during a rule-guided target selection task, and applied event-related Synthetic Aperture Magnetometry to image instantaneous changes in neuromagnetic source activity throughout the brain. During the task subjects selected one of two stimuli (the target) and ignored the other (the distracter) based on a color-rank rule (color 1 > color 2 > color 3). Our results revealed that in early visual color-sensitive areas and the parietal cortex visual stimuli evoke activity that scaled following the rank-order rule. This effect was stronger and occurred later in the parietal lobe (similar to 200 ms after target/distracter onset) relative to early visual areas (similar to 180 ms). Moreover, we found that transient changes in the target's motion direction evoked stronger responses relative to similar changes in the distracter at similar to 180 ms from change onset in contralateral areas hM+/V5. These results suggest that during target selection and allocation of attention to a stimulus, top-down signals adjust their intensity following complex selection rules according to the organism's priorities, thereby differentially modulating neuromagnetic activity across visual cortical areas.

Natural history of MELAS associated with mitochondrial DNA m.3243A > G genotype	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							LACTIC-ACIDOSIS; MUTATION LOAD; CLINICAL SPECTRUM; A3243G MUTATION; EPISODES MELAS; MTDNA; 3243A-GREATER-THAN-G; ENCEPHALOMYOPATHIES; ENCEPHALOPATHY; PHENOTYPES	Objective: To describe the natural history of clinical and laboratory features associated with the m.3243A>G mitochondrial DNA point mutation. Natural history data are needed to obtain prognostic information and for clinical trial planning. Methods: We included 85 matrilineal relatives from 35 families with at least 2 visits in this prospective cohort study. Thirty-one were fully symptomatic with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and 54 were carrier relatives. Evaluations included standardized questionnaires (medical history and daily living functioning), physical examination, neuropsychological testing, and a battery of imaging and laboratory tests. We evaluated changes in clinical and laboratory features over time and survival. Outcomes are reported over a follow-up period of up to 10.6 years (mean 3.8 +/- 2.2 years for patients and 5.5 +/- 3.0 for carrier relatives). Results: Neurologic examination, neuropsychological testing, and daily living scores significantly declined in all patients with MELAS, whereas no significant deterioration occurred in carrier relatives. Cerebral MRI scores declined significantly in patients with MELAS. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimates of lactate in the lateral ventricles increased over time, and high lactate was associated with increased mortality. Symptom onset in childhood often was associated with worse outcome. Patients with MELAS had a greater death rate than carrier relatives. Conclusions: Patients with MELAS carrying the m.3243A>G mutation show a measurable decline in clinical and imaging outcomes. It is hoped that these data will be helpful in anticipating the disease course and in planning clinical trials for MELAS.

Circulating IL-6 contributes to peripheral LPS-induced mPGES-1 expression in the rat brain	BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN			English	Article						Immune-to-brain communication; Prostaglandins; fever; STAT3; COX2; Localized inflammation	SENSORY CIRCUMVENTRICULAR ORGANS; NUCLEAR STAT3 TRANSLOCATION; PROSTAGLANDIN-E SYNTHASE-1; FEVER INDUCTION PATHWAYS; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; LOCALIZED INFLAMMATION; FEBRILE RESPONSE; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION; SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS	Interleukin-(1)6 is the most prominent circulating cytokine induced by systemic infection and inflammation, and the main humoral mediator to the brain in fever. We have previously demonstrated that the PG-pathway, the ultimate step in fever generation, is activated by circulating IL-6 by triggering the expression of the rate limiting enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)2 in the brain. Downstream of COX2, another enzyme, microsomal PG synthase (mPGES)-1 has also been implicated in the inflammatory response but relatively little is known about its role in cytokine mediated inflammation. Here, we investigated for the first time the direct role of circulating IL-6 in brain and peripheral mPGES-1-expression. Rats were either treated with LPS into a subcutaneous air pouch combined with intraperitoneal injection of a rat specific IL-6 antiserum (AS) or received a single intraperitoneal injection of IL-6. LPS increased the expression of mPGES-1 mRNA in the brain, liver and brown adipose tissue (BAT) but not epididymal white (eW) adipose tissue. This response was reversed by IL-6AS in LPS-injected animals for the brain and liver. IL-6-treatment only induced mPGES-1-expression in the brain and its immunoreactivity co-localized with phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 the main transcription factor activated by IL-6. Moreover, circulating IL-6 levels and the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3, a broadly used marker of STAT3-activation, strongly correlated with mPGES-1 expression in the brain. In summary, we have clearly shown that circulating IL-6 can directly induce mPGES-1 linked to STAT3-activation in the brain but not peripheral tissues of rats during localised peripheral inflammation.

Functionally Specific Changes in Resting-State Sensorimotor Networks after Motor Learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SECONDARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; GLOBAL SIGNAL; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; DECISION-MAKING; PREMOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN; MEMORY; DISCRIMINATION; RECALIBRATION	Motor learning changes the activity of cortical motor and subcortical areas of the brain, but does learning affect sensory systems as well? We examined in humans the effects of motor learning using fMRI measures of functional connectivity under resting conditions and found persistent changes in networks involving both motor and somatosensory areas of the brain. We developed a technique that allows us to distinguish changes in functional connectivity that can be attributed to motor learning from those that are related to perceptual changes that occur in conjunction with learning. Using this technique, we identified a new network in motor learning involving second somatosensory cortex, ventral premotor cortex, and supplementary motor cortex whose activation is specifically related to perceptual changes that occur in conjunction with motor learning. We also found changes in a network comprising cerebellar cortex, primary motor cortex, and dorsal premotor cortex that were linked to the motor aspects of learning. In each network, we observed highly reliable linear relationships between neuroplastic changes and behavioral measures of either motor learning or perceptual function. Motor learning thus results in functionally specific changes to distinct resting-state networks in the brain.

Influence of glioma tumour microenvironment on the transport of ANG1005 via low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						brain cancer; drug; cancer phenotype; Angiopep-2; blood-brain barrier; low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; DELIVERY VECTOR ANGIOPEP-2; CELL-MIGRATION; DRUG-DELIVERY; EXPRESSION; IDENTIFICATION; METASTASIS; SUPPRESSOR; HYPOXIA; METALLOPROTEINASES	BACKGROUND: ANG1005 consists of three molecules of paclitaxel conjugated via ester bonds to the 19-amino-acid peptide Angiopep-2. The new chemical agent has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by receptor-mediated transcytosis via low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). The experiments here examined the role of LRP1 in the subsequent endocytosis of drug into cancer cells. METHODS: Localisation of ANG1005 and Angiopep-2 was examined by immunohistochemistry and in-vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging in mice carrying orthotopic glioma tumours. Transport of ANG1005 and Angiopep-2 was examined in U87 glioblastoma cell lines. RESULTS: Systemically administered ANG1005 and Cy5.5Angiopep-2 localised to orthotopic glioma tumours in mice. The glioma transplants correlated with high expression levels of LRP1. Decreasing LRP1 activity, by RNA silencing or LRP1 competitors, decreased uptake of ANG1005 and Angiopep-2 into U87 glioblastoma cells. Conversely, LRP1 expression and endocytosis rates for ANG1005 and Angiopep-2 increased in U87 cells under conditions that mimicked the microenvironment near aggressive tumours, that is, hypoxic and acidic conditions. CONCLUSION: ANG1005 might be a particularly effective chemotherapeutic agent for the wide array of known LRP1-expressing brain and non-brain cancers, in particular those with an aggressive phenotype.

Glucose can lower the activity of one/hcrt cells, but whether other dietary macronutrients have similar effects is unclear. We show that orx/hcrt cells are stimulated by nutritionally relevant mixtures of amino acids (AAs), both in brain slice patch-clamp experiments, and in c-Fos expression assays following central or peripheral administration of AAs to mice in vivo. Physiological mixtures of AAs electrically excited orx/hcrt cells through a dual mechanism involving inhibition of K(ATP) channels and activation of system-A amino acid transporters. Nonessential AAs were more potent in activating orx/hcrt cells than essential AAs. Moreover, the presence of physiological concentrations of AAs suppressed the glucose responses of orx/hcrt cells. These results suggest a new mechanism of hypothalamic integration of macronutrient signals and imply that orx/hcrt cells sense macronutrient balance, rather than net energy value, in extracellular fluid.

Methods and Materials: We performed a retrospective review of 50 consecutive patients diagnosed with juxtapapillary choroidal melanoma and treated with linear accelerator-based stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy between April 2003 and December 2009. Patients with small to medium sized lesions (Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study classification) located within 2 mm of the optic disc were included. The prescribed radiation dose was 60 Gy in 10 fractions. The primary endpoints included local control, enucleation-free survival, and complication rates. Results: The median follow-up was 29 months (range, 1-77 months). There were 31 males and 29 females, with a median age of 69 years (range, 30-92 years). Eighty-four percent of the patients had medium sized lesions, and 16% of patients had small sized lesions. There were four cases of local progression (8%) and three enucleations (6%). Actuarial local control rates at 2 and 5 years were 93% and 86%, respectively. Actuarial enucleation-free survival rates at 2 and 5 years were 94% and 84%, respectively. Actuarial complication rates at 2 and 5 years were 33% and 88%, respectively, for radiation-induced retinopathy; 9.3% and 46.9%, respectively, for dry eye; 12% and 53%, respectively, for cataract; 30% and 90%, respectively, for visual loss [Snellen acuity (decimal equivalent), <0.1]; 11% and 54%, respectively, for optic neuropathy; and 18% and 38%, respectively, for neovascular glaucoma. Conclusions: Linear accelerator-based stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy using 60 Gy in 10 fractions is safe and has an acceptable toxicity profile. It has been shown to be an effective noninvasive treatment for juxtapapillary choroidal melanomas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.	[Al-Wassia, Rolina; Dal Pra, Alan; Shun, Kitty; Shaban, Ahmed; Cury, Fabio L.

Kallikreins 5, 6 and 10 Differentially Alter Pathophysiology and Overall Survival in an Ovarian Cancer Xenograft Model	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN TISSUE KALLIKREINS; PROTEINASE-ACTIVATED RECEPTORS; CELL-LINES; SERINE-PROTEASE; IMMUNOFLUOROMETRIC ASSAY; ZYME/PROTEASE M/NEUROSIN; SUBSTRATE-SPECIFICITY; CLINICAL-APPLICATIONS; BIOLOGICAL-FLUIDS; PROSTATE ANTIGEN	Human tissue kallikreins (KLKs) are members of a multigene family of serine proteases aberrantly expressed in many cancer types. In ovarian cancer, 12 KLKs are upregulated, and of those KLK5, 6 and 10 have been the focus of investigations into new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. However, little is known about the contributions of KLK5, 6 and 10 to ovarian cancer pathophysiology. In this study, a panel of 13 human ovarian cancer cell lines was screened by ELISA for secretion of KLK5, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 14. The ES-2 cell line, devoid of these kallikreins, was transfected with expression vectors of KLK5, 6 and 10 individually or in pairs. Co-expression of KLK5, 6 and 10 was correlated with lessened aggressivity of ovarian cancer cell lines as defined by reduced colony formation in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice. ES-2 clones overexpressing KLK5, 10/5, 10/6, 5/6 made significantly fewer colonies in soft agar. When compared to control mice, survival of mice injected with ES-2 clones overexpressing KLK10, 10/5, 10/6, 5/6 was significantly longer, while KLK6 was shorter. All groups displaying a survival advantage also differed quantitatively and qualitatively in their presentation of ascites, with both a reduced incidence of ascites and an absence of cellular aggregates within those ascites. The survival advantage conferred by KLK10 overexpression could be recapitulated with the exogenous administration of a recombinant KLK10. In conclusion, these findings indicate that KLK5, 6 and 10 may modulate the progression of ovarian cancer, and interact together to alter tumour pathophysiology. Furthermore, results support the putative role of KLK10 as a tumour suppressor and suggest it may hold therapeutic potential in ovarian cancer.

An arrhythmia that is particularly common in the elderly, AF is growing in prevalence with the aging of the population. Our understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern AF occurrence and persistence has been increasing rapidly. This article reviews the basic pathophysiology of AF over a broad range of levels, touching on the tissue mechanisms that maintain the arrhythmia, the relationship between clinical presentation and basic mechanisms, ion channel and transporter abnormalities that lead to ectopic impulse formation, basic models and tissue determinants of reentry, ion channel determinants of reentry, the nature and roles of electric and structural remodeling, autonomic neural components, anatomic factors, interactions between atrial and ventricular functional consequences of AF, and the basic determinants of atrial thromboembolism. We then review the potential implications of the basic pathophysiology of the arrhythmia for its management. We first discuss consequences for improved rhythm control pharmacotherapy: targeting underlying conditions, new atrium-selective drug targets, new targets for focal ectopic source suppression, and upstream therapy aiming to prevent remodeling. We then review the implications of basic mechanistic considerations for rate control therapy, AF ablation, and the prevention of thromboembolic events. We conclude with some thoughts about the future of translational research related to AF mechanisms. (Circulation. 2011;124:2264-2274.)

Thirty patients with iRBD and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects underwent one polysomnographic (PSG) noctumal sleep recording. SW automatic detection was performed on F3, C3, P3, and O1 leads and SW characteristics were derived (SW density, amplitude, frequency, slope, and duration of negative and positive phases). We also compared iRBD patients and control subjects on PSG variables and delta (025-4.0 Hz) spectral power. No between-group differences were found on PSG variables, delta spectral power, or SW characteristics. Results show no SW abnormalities in iRBD patients compared to healthy participants, which suggests similar level of synchronization of thalamo-cortical neurons during N-REM sleep.

However, the relationship between exposure to light and mood regulation remains unclear. As compared with green light, blue light was shown to acutely modulate emotion brain processing in healthy individuals. Here, we investigated the impact of light on emotion brain processing in patients with SAD and healthy control subjects and its relationship with retinal light sensitivity. Methods: Fourteen symptomatic untreated patients with SAD(34.5 +/- 8.2 years; 9 women) and 16 healthy control subjects (32.3 +/- 7.7 years; 11 women) performed an auditory emotional task in functional magnetic resonance imaging during the fall/winter season, while being exposed to alternating blue and green monochromatic light. Scotopic and photopic retinal light sensitivities were then evaluated with electroretinography. Results: Blue light enhanced responses to auditory emotional stimuli in the posterior hypothalamus in patients with SAD, whereas green light decreased these responses. These effects of blue and green light were not observed in healthy control subjects, despite similar retinal sensitivity in SAD and control subjects. Conclusions: These results point to the posterior hypothalamus as the neurobiological substrate involved in specific aspects of SAD, including a distinctive response to light and altered emotional responses.

Most genetic and/or environmental factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of human NTDs are unknown. Recently, however, pathogenic mutations of VANGL1 and VANGL2 genes have been associated with some cases of human NTDs. Vangl genes encode proteins of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway that regulates cell behavior during early stages of neural tube formation. Homozygous disruption of PCP genes in mice results in a spectrum of NTDs, including defects that affect the entire neural axis (craniorachischisis), cranial NTDs (exencephaly) and spina bifida. In this paper, we report the dynamic expression of another PCP gene, Fuzzy, during neural tube formation in mice. We also identify non-synonymous Fuzzy amino acid substitutions in some patients with NTDs and demonstrate that several of these Fuzzy mutations affect formation of primary cilia and ciliary length or affect directional cell movement. Since Fuzzy knockout mice exhibit both NTDs and defective primary cilia and Fuzzy is expressed in the emerging neural tube, we propose that mutations in Fuzzy may account for a subset of NTDs in humans.

The biological activity of DOCK180 is tightly linked to its binding partner ELMO. We previously reported that autoinhibited ELMO proteins regulate signaling from this pathway. One mechanism to activate the ELMO-DOCK180 complex appears to be the recruitment of this complex to the membrane via the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of ELMO. In the present study, we aimed to identify novel ELMO-interacting proteins to further define the molecular events capable of controlling ELMO recruitment to the membrane. To do so, we performed two independent interaction screens: one specifically interrogated an active GTPase library while the other probed a brain cDNA library. Both methods converged on Arl4A, an Arf-related GTPase, as a specific ELMO interactor. Biochemically, Arl4A is constitutively GTP-loaded, and our binding assays confirm that both wild-type and constitutively active forms of the GTPase associate with ELMO. Mechanistically, we report that Arl4A binds the ELMO RBD and acts as a membrane localization signal for ELMO. In addition, we report that membrane targeting of ELMO via Arl4A promotes cytoskeletal reorganization including membrane ruffling and stress fiber disassembly via an ELMO-DOCK1800-Rac signaling pathway. We conclude that ELMO is capable of interacting with GTPases from Rho and Arf families, leading to the conclusion that ELMO contains a versatile RBD. Furthermore, via binding of an Arf family GTPase, the ELMO-DOCK180 is uniquely positioned at the membrane to activate Rac signaling and remodel the actin cytoskeleton.

FATTY ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE EXPRESSION DURING RETINAL POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT IN RATS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						endocannabinoids; anandamide; CB1R; immunohistochemistry; bipolar cells; retinogenesis	DEVELOPING MOUSE RETINA; CONE BIPOLAR CELLS; CHOLINERGIC AMACRINE CELLS; CB2 CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NUCLEAR ANTIGEN PCNA; GANGLION-CELLS; HORIZONTAL CELLS; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; GLUTAMINE-SYNTHETASE	The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is thought to participate in developmental processes in the CNS. The rodent retina represents a valuable model to study CNS development because it contains well-identified cell types with established developmental timelines. The distribution of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) was recently revealed in the developing retina; however, the expression patterns of other elements of this system remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of the degradative enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), a key regulator of the eCB system, in the rat retina during postnatal development. To identify the cells expressing the enzyme, co-stainings were carried out for FAAH and retinal cell type markers. FAAH was expressed at postnatal day (P) 1 in ganglion and cholinergic amacrine cells. In the course of development, it appeared in cones, horizontal, and bipolar cells. For most cell types (horizontal, cholinergic amacrine cells, and cone bipolar cells), FAAH was transiently expressed, suggesting an important redistribution of the enzyme during postnatal development and thus a potential role of the eCB system in developmental processes. Our results also indicated that, in the adult retina, FAAH is expressed in cones, rod bipolar cells, and some retinal ganglion cells. The presence of FAAH in adult animals supports the hypothesis that the eCB system is involved in retinal functions.

IBS pain symptoms have been hypothesized to depend on peripheral and central mechanisms, but the pathophysiology is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of cerebral and cerebrospinal processes to pain inhibition deficits in IBS. Fourteen female patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) and 14 healthy female volunteers were recruited. Acute pain and the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (RIII reflex) were evoked by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the right sural nerve with modulation by hetero-segmental counter-irritation produced by sustained cold pain applied on the left forearm. Psychological symptoms were assessed by questionnaires. Shock pain decreased significantly during counter-irritation in the controls (P<0.001) but not in IBS patients (P=0.52). Similarly, RIII-reflex amplitude declined during counter-irritation in the controls (P=0.009) but not in IBS patients (P=0.11). Furthermore, pain-related anxiety increased during counter-irritation in IBS patients (P=0.003) but not in the controls (P=0.74). Interestingly, across all subjects, counterirritation analgesia was positively correlated with RIII-reflex inhibition (r=0.39, P=0.04) and negatively with pain-related anxiety (r=-0.61, P<0.001). In addition, individual differences in counter-irritation analgesia were predicted independently by the modulation of RIII responses (P=0.03) and by pain catastrophizing (P=0.01), with the latter mediating the effect of pain-related anxiety. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that pain inhibition deficits in female IBS-D patients depend on two potentially separable mechanisms reflecting: (1) altered descending modulation and (2) higher-order brain processes underlying regulation of pain and affect.

Here, we assessed the contribution of the calcium-dependent K+ channel KCNN4 (KCa3.1, IK1, SK4) to secondary damage after moderate contusion lesions in the lower thoracic spinal cord of adult mice. Changes in KCNN4 mRNA levels (RT-PCR), KCa3.1 protein expression (Western blots), and cellular expression (immunofluorescence) in the mouse spinal cord were monitored between 1 and 28 d after SCI. KCNN4 mRNA and KCa3.1 protein rapidly increased after SCI; double labeling identified astrocytes as the main cellular source accounting for this upregulation. Locomotor function after SCI, evaluated for 28 d in an open-field test using the Basso Mouse Scale, was improved in a dose-dependent manner by treating mice with a selective inhibitor of KCa3.1 channels, TRAM-34 (triarylmethane-34). Improved locomotor function was accompanied by reduced tissue loss at 28 d and increased neuron and axon sparing. The rescue of tissue by TRAM-34 treatment was preceded by reduced expression of the proinflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta in spinal cord tissue at 12 h after injury, and reduced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase at 7 d after SCI. In astrocytes in vitro, TRAM-34 inhibited Ca2+ signaling in response to metabotropic purinergic receptor stimulation. These results suggest that blocking the KCa3.1 channel could be a potential therapeutic approach for treating secondary damage after spinal cord injury.

Engagement of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) expressed on activated T cells with its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) suppresses T cell responses. We recently demonstrated in MS lesions elevated PD-L1 expression by glial cells and absence of PD-1 on many infiltrating CD8 T cells. We have now investigated whether human brain endothelial cells (HBECs), which maintain the BBB, can express PD-L1 or PD-L2 and thereby modulate T cells. Methods: We used primary cultures of HBECs isolated from non-tumoral CNS tissue either under basal or inflamed conditions. We assessed the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 using qPCR and flow cytometry. Human CD8 T cells were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors and co-cultured with HBECs. Following co-culture with HBECs, proliferation and cytokine production by human CD8 T cells were measured by flow cytometry whereas transmigration was determined using a well established in vitro model of the BBB. The functional impact of PD-L1 and PD-L2 provided by HBECs was determined using blocking antibodies. We performed immunohistochemistry for the detection of PD-L1 or PD-L2 concurrently with caveolin-1 (a cell specific marker for endothelial cells) on post-mortem human brain tissues obtained from MS patients and normal controls. Results: Under basal culture conditions, PD-L2 is expressed on HBECs, whilst PD-L1 is not detected. Both ligands are up-regulated under inflammatory conditions. Blocking PD-L1 and PD-L2 leads to increased transmigration and enhanced responses by human CD8 T cells in co-culture assays. Similarly, PD-L1 and PD-L2 blockade significantly increases CD4 T cell transmigration. Brain endothelium in normal tissues and MS lesions does not express detectable PD-L1; in contrast, all blood vessels in normal brain tissues are PD-L2-positive, while only about 50% express PD-L2 in MS lesions. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that brain endothelial cells contribute to control T cell transmigration into the CNS and immune responses via PD-L2 expression. However, such impact is impaired in MS lesions due to downregulation of endothelium PD-L2 levels.

Given the variety of timescales underlying events in the natural world, determining the temporal characteristics of adaptation is important to understanding how perception adjusts to its sensory environment. Previous work has shown that neural adaptation can occur on a timescale of milliseconds, but perceptual adaptation has generally been studied over relatively long timescales, typically on the order of seconds. This disparity raises important questions. Can perceptual adaptation be observed at brief, functionally relevant timescales? And if so, how do its properties relate to the rapid adaptation seen in cortical neurons? We address these questions in the context of visual motion processing, a perceptual modality characterized by rapid temporal dynamics. We demonstrate objectively that 25 ms of motion adaptation is sufficient to generate a motion aftereffect, an illusory sensation of movement experienced when a moving stimulus is replaced by a stationary pattern. This rapid adaptation occurs regardless of whether the adapting motion is perceived. In neurophysiological recordings from the middle temporal area of primate visual cortex, we find that brief motion adaptation evokes direction-selective responses to subsequently presented stationary stimuli. A simple model shows that these neural responses can explain the consequences of rapid perceptual adaptation. Overall, we show that the motion aftereffect is not merely an intriguing perceptual illusion, but rather a reflection of rapid neural and perceptual processes that can occur essentially every time we experience motion.

Newborn human infants can discriminate phonetic contrasts and extract rhythm, prosodic information, and simple regularities from speech. Yet, there is scarce evidence that infants can recognize common words from the surrounding language before four months of age. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied one hundred and twelve 1-5 day-old infants, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We found that newborns tested with a novel bisyllabic word show greater hemodynamic brain response than newborns tested with a familiar bisyllabic word. We showed that newborns recognize the familiar word after two minutes of silence or after hearing music, but not after hearing a different word. Conclusions/Significance: The data show that retroactive interference is an important cause of forgetting in the early stages of language acquisition. Moreover, because neonates forget words in the presence of some -but not all- sounds, the results indicate that the interference phenomenon that causes forgetting is selective.

On the Time Course of Vocal Emotion Recognition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							UNIVERSAL FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; SPOKEN WORD RECOGNITION; AFFECT DECISION TASK; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION; MEANINGLESS SPEECH; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ERP EVIDENCE; PROSODY; LANGUAGE	How quickly do listeners recognize emotions from a speaker's voice, and does the time course for recognition vary by emotion type? To address these questions, we adapted the auditory gating paradigm to estimate how much vocal information is needed for listeners to categorize five basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness) and neutral utterances produced by male and female speakers of English. Semantically-anomalous pseudo-utterances (e. g., The rivix jolled the silling) conveying each emotion were divided into seven gate intervals according to the number of syllables that listeners heard from sentence onset. Participants (n = 48) judged the emotional meaning of stimuli presented at each gate duration interval, in a successive, blocked presentation format. Analyses looked at how recognition of each emotion evolves as an utterance unfolds and estimated the "identification point" for each emotion. Results showed that anger, sadness, fear, and neutral expressions are recognized more accurately at short gate intervals than happiness, and particularly disgust; however, as speech unfolds, recognition of happiness improves significantly towards the end of the utterance (and fear is recognized more accurately than other emotions). When the gate associated with the emotion identification point of each stimulus was calculated, data indicated that fear (M = 517 ms), sadness (M = 576 ms), and neutral (M = 510 ms) expressions were identified from shorter acoustic events than the other emotions. These data reveal differences in the underlying time course for conscious recognition of basic emotions from vocal expressions, which should be accounted for in studies of emotional speech processing.

A custom-built PET phantom design for quantitative imaging of printed distributions	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							DIGITAL BRAIN PHANTOM	This note presents a practical approach to a custom-made design of PET phantoms enabling the use of digital radioactive distributions with high quantitative accuracy and spatial resolution. The phantom design allows planar sources of any radioactivity distribution to be imaged in transaxial and axial (sagittal or coronal) planes. Although the design presented here is specially adapted to the high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT), the presented methods can be adapted to almost any PET scanner. Although the presented phantom design has many advantages, a number of practical issues had to be overcome such as positioning of the printed source, calibration, uniformity and reproducibility of printing. A well counter (WC) was used in the calibration procedure to find the nonlinear relationship between digital voxel intensities and the actual measured radioactive concentrations. Repeated printing together with WC measurements and computed radiography (CR) using phosphor imaging plates (IP) were used to evaluate the reproducibility and uniformity of such printing. Results show satisfactory printing uniformity and reproducibility; however, calibration is dependent on the printing mode and the physical state of the cartridge. As a demonstration of the utility of using printed phantoms, the image resolution and quantitative accuracy of reconstructed HRRT images are assessed. There is very good quantitative agreement in the calibration procedure between HRRT, CR and WC measurements. However, the high resolution of CR and its quantitative accuracy supported by WC measurements made it possible to show the degraded resolution of HRRT brain images caused by the partial-volume effect and the limits of iterative image reconstruction.

Here we study the retinal neuronal RGC-5 cell line after laser transection, demonstrating that the ability of these cells to initiate a regenerative response correlates with axon length and cell motility after injury. We show that low energy picosecond laser pulses can achieve transection of unlabeled single axons in vitro and precisely induce damage with micron precision. We established the conditions to achieve axon transection, and characterized RGC-5 axon regeneration and cell body response using time-lapse microscopy. We developed an algorithm to analyze cell trajectories and established correlations between cell motility after injury, axon length, and the initiation of the regeneration response. The characterization of the motile response of axotomized RGC-5 cells showed that cells that were capable of repair or regrowth of damaged axons migrated more slowly than cells that could not. Moreover, we established that RGC-5 cells with long axons could not recover their injured axons, and such cells were much more motile. The platform we describe allows highly controlled axonal damage with subcellular resolution and the performance of high-content screening in cell cultures.

Previous studies have reported an involvement of dopamine-related ventral striatum. However, structural brain correlates of video game playing have not been investigated. On magnetic resonance imaging scans of 154 14-year-olds, we computed voxel-based morphometry to explore differences between frequent and infrequent video game players. Moreover, we assessed the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task during functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT). We found higher left striatal grey matter volume when comparing frequent against infrequent video game players that was negatively correlated with deliberation time in CGT. Within the same region, we found an activity difference in MID task: frequent compared with infrequent video game players showed enhanced activity during feedback of loss compared with no loss. This activity was likewise negatively correlated with deliberation time. The association of video game playing with higher left ventral striatum volume could reflect altered reward processing and represent adaptive neural plasticity.

Similarly, several lines of evidence suggest that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) could be due to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. As part of a project aimed at exploring rare and/or de novo mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders, we have sequenced the seven genes encoding for NMDA receptor subunits (NMDARs) in a large cohort of individuals affected with SCZ or ASD (n = 429 and 428, respectively), parents of these subjects and controls (n 568). Here, we identified two de novo mutations in patients with sporadic SCZ in GRIN2A and one de novo mutation in GRIN2B in a patient with ASD. Truncating mutations in GRIN2C, GRIN3A and GRIN3B were identified in both subjects and controls, but no truncating mutations were found in the GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B and GRIN2D genes, both in patients and controls, suggesting that these subunits are critical for neurodevelopment. The present results support the hypothesis that rare de novo mutations in GRIN2A or GRIN2B can be associated with cases of sporadic SCZ or ASD, just as it has recently been described for the related neurodevelopmental disease intellectual disability. The influence of genetic variants appears different, depending on NMDAR subunits. Functional compensation could occur to counteract the loss of one allele in GRIN2C and GRIN3 family genes, whereas GRIN1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B and GRIN2D appear instrumental to normal brain development and function.

Measurement of cerebral microvascular compliance in a model of atherosclerosis with optical coherence tomography	BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BLOOD-FLOW; ANGIOGRAPHY; BRAIN	Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has recently been used to produce 3D angiography of microvasculature and blood flow maps of large vessels in the rodent brain in-vivo. However, use of this optical method for the study of cerebrovascular disease has not been fully explored. Recent developments in neurodegenerative diseases has linked common cardiovascular risk factors to neurodegenerative risk factors hinting at a vascular hypothesis for the development of the latter. Tools for studying cerebral blood flow and the myogenic tone of cerebral vasculature have thus far been either highly invasive or required ex-vivo preparations therefore not preserving the delicate in-vivo conditions. We propose a novel technique for reconstructing the flow profile over a single cardiac cycle in order to evaluate flow pulsatility and vessel compliance. A vascular model is used to simulate changes in vascular compliance and interpret OCT results. Comparison between atherosclerotic and wild type mice show a trend towards increased compliance in the smaller arterioles of the brain (diameter < 80 mu m) in the disease model. These results are consistent with previously published ex-vivo work confirming the ability of OCT to investigate vascular dysfunction.

The superior colliculi (SC) may be involved in USN expression, and the spatial summation effect (SSE), where reaction times to bilateral stimuli are faster than to unilateral, may be a behavioral index of SC function. We determined the feasibility of investigating SC contribution to poststroke USN using the SSE in 3 groups. Methods: Seven participants with left near-extrapersonal space USN (USN+) following right hemisphere stroke, 10 without (USN-), and 10 controls were tested under binocular/monocular (right eye patched) conditions while responding to unilateral/bilateral stimuli. Control and USN- groups completed the SSE paradigm. Results: Most USN+ participants were unable to initiate the SSE paradigm due to poor visual fixation and demonstrated higher contrast sensitivity for left-sided stimuli. Controls showed an SSE (under both viewing conditions) while the USN- showed an abnormal SSE whereby reaction times to bilateral stimuli were faster than to unilateral-left but not to unilateral-right stimuli (under both binocular/monocular conditions). Conclusion: This study is the first to investigate SC contribution in poststroke USN using the SSE; we identified higher contrast sensitivity to left-sided stimuli and poor fixation in the USN+ group. These findings suggest avenues for research that may lead to novel rehabilitation interventions.

Methods: From March 1, 2005 to February 28, 2008, an average of 2,545 paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists were surveyed monthly through the established network of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program. We calculated incidence rates using the number of confirmed cases over the product of the duration of the study (3 years) and population estimates by age group. Results: There were 220 confirmed cases of head injury from suspected child maltreatment. The annual incidence rate was 14.1 per 100,000 for children less than 1 year of age and 1.4 per 100,000 for those less than 15 years. Seventy three percent (141) of cases involved infants less than 12 months of age and 52% (100) of cases involved infants less than 6 months of age. Seventy-five percent (165) of cases presented to the emergency room. With regard to outcome, 12% (27) of cases resulted in death and 45% (75) of survivors had neurological sequelae at discharge. Thirty percent (67) of all cases, as well as, 30% (8) of deaths were previously known to child welfare authorities. Conclusion: This study provides an estimate of the rate of head injury secondary to suspected child maltreatment in Canada. The young age and poor medical outcomes of those involved highlights the need for prevention efforts that are implemented early in life. Given that a significant percentage of injured infants and children were already known to child welfare authorities, the study also highlights the need to establish and evaluate additional preventive efforts for parents and caregivers already in the child welfare system.

Caffeine was started at 200 mg daily and was increased to a maximum of 1,000 mg. Results: Of 25 subjects, 20 tolerated 200 mg, 17 tolerated 400 mg, 7 tolerated 800 mg, and 3 tolerated 1,000 mg. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal discomfort, anxiety, and worsening/emerging tremor. At 400 mg daily, we found potential improvements in motor manifestations and somnolence (UPDRS III: -4.5 +/- 4.6, P = 0.003; Epworth: -2.0 +/- 3.0, P = 0.015). Conclusion: Maximum dose tolerability for caffeine in PD appears to be 100 to 200 mg BID. We found pilot preliminary evidence that caffeine may improve some motor and nonmotor aspects of PD, which must be confirmed in longer term, placebo-controlled, clinical trials.

Aims To investigate the effects of lowered serotonin on cocaine-induced (1.0 mg/kg cocaine, self-administered intranasally) dopamine responses and drug craving. Method In non-dependent cocaine users, serotonin transmission was reduced using the acute tryptophan depletion method. Striatal dopamine responses were measured using positron emission tomography with [C-11]raclopride. Results Acute tryptophan depletion increased drug craving and striatal dopamine responses to cocaine. These acute tryptophan depletion-induced increases did not occur in the absence of cocaine. Conclusions The results suggest that low serotonin transmission can increase dopaminergic and appetitive responses to cocaine. These findings might identify a mechanism by which individuals with low serotonin are at elevated risk for both substance use disorders and comorbid conditions.	[Cox, Sylvia M.

Neuroinflammation in acute liver failure: Mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Neuroinflammation; Hepatic encephalopathy; Acute liver failure; Ammonia; Proinflammatory cytokines; Microglia	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER; N-ACETYLCYSTEINE; BRAIN EDEMA; INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; ARTERIAL AMMONIA; MILD HYPOTHERMIA; CEREBRAL EDEMA	It is increasingly evident that neuroinflammatory mechanisms are implicated in the pathogenesis of the central nervous system (CNS) complications (intracranial hypertension, brain herniation) of acute liver failure (ALF). Neuroinflammation in ALF is characterized by microglial activation and arteriovenous difference studies as well as studies of gene expression confirm local brain production and release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha and the interleukins IL-1 beta and IL-6. Although the precise nature of the glial cell responsible for brain cytokine synthesis is not yet established, evidence to date supports a role for both astrocytes and microglia. The neuroinflammatory response in ALF progresses in parallel with the progression of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and with the severity of brain edema (astrocyte swelling). Mechanisms responsible for the relaying of signals from the failing liver to the brain include transduction of systemic proinflammatory signals as well as the effects of increased brain lactate leading to increased release of cytokines from both astrocytes and microglia. There is evidence in support of a synergistic effect of proinflammatory cytokines and ammonia in the pathogenesis of HE and brain edema in ALF. Therapeutic implications of the findings of a neuroinflammatory response in ALF are multiple. Removal of both ammonia and proinflammatory cytokines is possible using antibiotics or albumen dialysis. Mild hypothermia reduces brain ammonia transfer, brain lactate production, microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine production resulting in reduced brain edema and intracranial pressure in ALF. N-Acetylcysteine acts as both an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent at both peripheral and central sites of action independently resulting in slowing of HE progression and prevention of brain edema. Novel treatments that directly target the neuroinflammatory response in ALF include the use of etanercept, a TNF-alpha neutralizing molecule and minocycline, an agent with potent inhibitory actions on microglial activation that are independent of its antimicrobial properties; both agents have been shown to be effective in reducing neuroinflammation and in preventing the CNS complications of ALF. Translation of these findings to the clinic has the potential to provide rational targeted approaches to the prevention and treatment of these complications in the near future. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The Perceptual Consequences of Interocular Suppression in Amblyopia	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; SPATIAL VISION; NEURAL BASIS; DEFICIT; NOISE; INHIBITION; THRESHOLD; SUMMATION; HUMANS	PURPOSE. It is known that information from an amblyopic eye can be strongly suppressed when both eyes are open. The authors investigated the way in which suppression influences the relative perception of suprathreshold contrast and luminance between a person's eyes under dichoptic viewing conditions. METHODS. Stimuli consisted of four patches of luminance or four patches containing gratings. Two patches were presented to each eye. Ten amblyopes with mild suppression (six strabismic, three anisometropic and strabismic, and one deprivation; mean age, 34.5 years) and three control observers with normal vision (mean age, 33.0 years) matched the appearance of the stimuli presented to each eye. The match involved manipulation of either luminance or contrast. RESULTS. Amblyopes with mild suppression decreased stimulus luminance in the fellow fixing eye or increased luminance in the amblyopic eye to achieve a match (mean matching luminance, 21.1 and 39.6 cd/m(2) for the fellow fixing eye and the amblyopic eye, respectively; standard luminance, 30 cd/m(2)). This interocular mismatch was also observed when luminance was variable and contrast was kept constant (mean matching luminance, 22.8 cd/m(2) for the fellow fixing eye). On the other hand, the amblyopic eye showed no loss of perceived contrast. There was little or no mismatch between the two eyes of control participants with normal binocular vision. CONCLUSIONS. Amblyopes have monocular deficits in contrast perception but dichoptic deficits in luminance perception, suggesting that suppression in its mild form involves luminance processing.

J	MacLean, DM; Bowie, D				MacLean, David M.; Bowie, Derek			Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein regulation of competitive antagonism: a problem of interpretation	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							RAT HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; KAINATE RECEPTORS; GLUTAMATE; DESENSITIZATION; CNQX; DEACTIVATION; DOMAINS; NEURONS; CHANNEL	Synaptic AMPA receptors are greatly influenced by a family of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) which control trafficking, channel gating and pharmacology. The prototypical TARP, stargazin (or gamma 2), shifts the blocking ability of several AMPAR-selective compounds including the commonly used quinoxalinedione antagonists, CNQX and NBQX. Stargazin's effect on CNQX is particularly intriguing as it not only apparently lowers the potency of block, as with NBQX, but also renders it a partial agonist. Given this, agonist behaviour by CNQX has been speculated to account for its weaker blocking effect on AMPAR-TARP complexes. Here we show that this is not the case. The apparent effect of stargazin on CNQX antagonism can be almost entirely explained by an increase in the apparent affinity for L-glutamate (L-Glu), a full agonist and neurotransmitter at AMPAR synapses. Partial agonism at best plays a minor role but not through channel gating per se but rather because CNQX elicits AMPAR desensitization. Our study reveals that CNQX is best thought of as a non-competitive antagonist at glutamatergic synapses due to the predominance of non-equilibrium conditions. Consequently, CNQX primarily reports the proportion of AMPARs available for activation but may also impose additional block by receptor desensitization.

HERVs influence cellular gene expression and contribute to normal physiological processes such as cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. HERVs have also been associated with certain pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. As HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and has been shown to modulate host gene expression mainly through the expression of the powerful Tax transactivator, herein we were interested in looking at the potential modulation capacity of HTLV-1 Tax on HERV expression. In order to evaluate the promoter activity of different HERV LTRs, pHERV-LTR-luc constructs were co-transfected in Jurkat T-cells with a Tax expression vector. Tax expression potently increased the LTR activity of HERV-W8 and HERV-H (MC16). In parallel, Jurkat cells were also stimulated with different T-cell-activating agents and HERV LTRs were observed to respond to different combination of Forskolin, bpV[pic] a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, and PMA. Transfection of expression vectors for different Tax mutants in Jurkat cells showed that several transcription factors including CREB appeared to be important for HERV-W8 LTR activation. Deletion mutants were derived from the HERV-W8 LTR and the region from -137 to -123 was found to be important for LTR response following Tax expression in Jurkat cells, while a different region was shown to be required in cells treated with activators. Our results thus demonstrated that HTLV-1 Tax activates several HERV LTRs. This raises the possibility that upregulated HERV expression could be involved in diseases associated with HTLV-1 infection.

Data regarding the long-term disease progression outside of therapeutic trials are lacking. We examined the effects of standard of care for AD patients on the prognosis of the disease in a real-life study over a 4-year period. Methods: A total of 686 patients with mild-moderate All were enrolled in 16 memory clinics (REseau sur la maladie d' Alzheimer FRancais [REAL.FR] cohort) and followed up twice annually with tools used in therapeutic trials (Mini-Mental Status Examination, Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale [ADAS-cog]: cognitive function, Clinical Dementia Rating: dementia severity, Activity of Daily Living [ADL]: incapacities, NeuroPsychiatric Inventory: neuropsychiatric symptom). Results: More than 90% of the patients used AD-specific medication over 4 years. Patients lost on average 2.4 points per year on the Mini-Mental Status Examination and gained 4.5 points on the ADAS-cog. ADL and NeuroPsychiatric Inventory scores became significantly worse over time. Incidence of incapacities for ADL and worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms were 52.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.7-57.4) and 51.1 (95% CI: 46.2-56.1), respectively. Rates of mortality and institutionalization were 7.4(95% CI: 6.2-8.5) and 13.4(95% CI: 11.7-15.1). In all, 17% of patients in mild stage at baseline (Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5) did not experience a major event (functional disabilities, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or death) over a 4-year period. Conclusions: As compared with previous surveys, the current study shows slower rates of decline in AD patients.

We reviewed this literature and our current practice to better inform the critical care practitioner and to identify gaps for future research. We electronically searched observational, intervention and outcome studies addressing sedation, analgesia and delirium in the NICU, and their bibliographies. Practice patterns were assessed in three critical care units with specialized neurological care in Montreal. Bedside pain assessment tools are psychometrically validated in the neuro-critically ill but sedation and delirium tools are not. Rigorous pain and sedation assessments appear feasible; delirium screening has not been tested. Publications addressing outcomes and responses to pharmacologic treatment lack consistency, rigor or both. In daily practice, pharmacologic management varies greatly. Clearly, little information exists on analgesia, sedation and delirium in the NICU. Systematic evaluation of pain improves outcome. No evidence-based therapeutic recommendations can be proffered.

Neurolathyrism in Vapniarka: Medical Heroism in a Concentration Camp	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review							MOTOR-NEURON DISEASES; LATHYRUS EXCITOTOXIN; ACID; MECHANISM; OSTEOLATHYRISM; FEATURES; ODAP	Stories abound about the medical abuses that have come to define medicine and the "pseudo"-neurosciences in the Third Reich. Well known are the Nazi program of euthanasia and the neuroscientific publications that arose from it. Nevertheless, during this widespread perversion of medical practice and science, true medical heroics persisted, even in the concentration camps. In December 1942, inmates of Camp Vapniarka began experiencing painful lower extremity muscle cramps, spastic paraparesis, and urinary incontinence. In order to reduce the cost of feeding the 1200, mostly Jewish, inmates of Camp Vapniarka and surreptitiously hasten their deaths, the Nazi-affiliated Romanian officers of the camp had begun feeding them a diet high in Lathyrus sativus. L. sativus is the neurotoxin implicated in neurolathyrism, a degenerative disease of the upper motor neurons. Dr. Arthur Kessler, one of the camp's prisoners, eventually identified the source of the epidemic. Armed with this knowledge, the inmates collectively organized to halt its spread.

In this study, we examined the effects of using phenytoin prophylaxis on mild, moderate, and severe TBIs. There have been no studies looking at compliance rate and side effects of systematic use of phenytoin at a large population scale. The goal of this study is to determine 1) the proportion of TBI patients receiving phenytoin prophylaxis; 2) which parameters decided when to decide administer phenytoin; 3) prophylaxis efficacy and complication rate. Methods: We retrospectively studied all patients admitted with a TBI over a two year-period and collected the following information: age, GCS score, CT-scan Marshall grade, incidence of early PTS, incidence of phenytoin use and time delay, side effects, and incidence of over-dosage or under-dosage. Results: 1008 patients were included. 5.4% had early PTS, 2.3 % while on prophylaxis and 3.1% while not on prophylaxis, 1.9% before reaching the hospital and 1.2% prior to phenytoin administration while in hospital. Delay of administration was 5 hours. 64.8% received prophylaxis and physicians used positive CT scan as the primary decision-making parameter (p<.001). Compliance with guidelines was 99.7%. Adverse reactions occurred in 0.5%. Levels were drawn in 42.2% (52% therapeutic, 41% low, 7% high). Conclusions: Phenytoin is used according to guidelines, with CT scan being the main decision factor for its use. The frequency of early PTS rate is low and side effects are rare. However, earlier administration of phenytoin and adequate levels could further prevent early PTS.

J	Gauthier, Y				Gauthier, Yvon			Child analysis in a changing world. In the face of a paradigm shift from the mind to the brain: Can we meet the challenge?	INFANT MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article							PSYCHOTHERAPY; ATTACHMENT; MOTHER	Child analysts and child therapists are now practicing in a new environment where an increased emphasis is made on identifying the symptoms and finding the shortest possible way to get rid of them, from the knowledge of brain functioning. From that perspective, the history of the symptom, of the child who owns it, and of the family in which this child is being raised are not emphasized as strongly. Searching for a specific meaning of such symptoms seems to be of no more interest. How can such a heavy trend be met? Major changes also have occurred within the psychoanalytic milieu. Advances from the observational world, from Spitz (1945) to Bowlby's (1987) attachment theory, provide essential knowledge to the field of early childparent interactions. Longitudinal research in recent decades has shown close ties between early development and future outcomes. Such new knowledge is inspiring child analysis with very young children as well as with severely disturbed, older children. Early intervention with disadvantaged populations is showing the importance of the nonspecific aspects of the therapeutic relationship as a factor of change. In light of recent neurobiologic research on the influence of a specific environmentattachment experienceson early development of the brain, it is now possible to speak of the social brain (Cozolino, 2006).

Do symptoms of bipolar disorder exhibit seasonal variation? A multisite prospective investigation	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						bipolar disorder; multi-level modeling; photoperiod; seasonality	SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; MANIA; DEPRESSION; CLIMATE; UNIPOLAR; PATTERN; MOOD; NEUROTICISM; PSYCHOSIS	Objectives: Evidence that symptoms of bipolar disorder (BD) vary seasonally is inconclusive. Here, a multisite prospective investigation of patients with BD was used to test the hypothesis that, on average, depressive symptoms peak in autumn / winter and hypo / manic symptoms peak in spring / summer. Secondary analyses explored gender and diagnosis [bipolar I disorder (BD-I) versus bipolar II disorder (BD-II)] effects on seasonality. Methods: A sample of 429 patients with BD (61.6% female; 56.2% BD-I) were recruited from 12 sites across Canada. Clinician-rated measures of manic [Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), n = 4,753 total observations] and depression symptoms [Montgomery-A sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), n = 4,691 observations] were taken at scheduled three-month visits as well as any unscheduled visits. At scheduled visits only, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) assessments (n = 3,153 observations) were also made. Multi-level modeling (MLM) analyses were conducted separately for the three dependent variables and three definitions of Time: calendar month, nominal season, and harmonic analysis. Results: Primary analyses of the whole sample found that for manic symptoms (YMRS), neither calendar month nor nominal season were significant, and harmonic analyses found an unpredicted frequency two sinusoid, with peaks at 4 th December and 4 th June (p < 0.018). Secondary analyses found that this sinusoid approximately fit the YMRS data for females and those diagnosed with BD-II. For depression symptoms measured on the MADRS and Ham-D, no significant seasonal patterns were found in primary analyses of the whole sample. Secondary analyses found a significant increase in MADRS scores in November / December among females, but this pattern was not corroborated in nominal season or harmonic analyses. Conclusions: No evidence of systematic seasonal variation in symptoms was found in the sample as a whole. Primary analyses found no evidence that hypo / manic symptoms peaked in the lighter months and depressive symptoms peaked in the darker months. The present findings align with broadly negative conclusions from three earlier prospective investigations, and provide the strongest evidence to date that seasonal changes do not in fact cause coordinated variation in BD symptoms.

Increasing findings suggest that CORT exerts its impact on synaptic plasticity by altering the functional properties of glutamate receptors, which include changes in the motility and function of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid subtype of glutamate receptor (AMPAR) that are responsible for the expression of synaptic plasticity. Here we provide evidence that CORT could also regulate synaptic plasticity by modulating the function of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which mediate the induction of synaptic plasticity. We found that stress level CORT applied to adult rat hippocampal slices potentiated evoked NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses within 30 min. Surprisingly, following this fast-onset change, we observed a slow-onset (>1 hour after termination of CORT exposure) increase in synaptic expression of GluN2A-containing NMDARs. To investigate the consequences of the distinct fast-and slow-onset modulation of NMDARs for synaptic plasticity, we examined the formation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) within relevant time windows. Paralleling the increased NMDAR function, both LTP and LTD were facilitated during CORT treatment. However, 1-2 hours after CORT treatment when synaptic expression of GluN2A-containing NMDARs is increased, bidirectional plasticity was no longer facilitated. Our findings reveal the remarkable plasticity of NMDARs in the adult hippocampus in response to CORT. CORT-mediated slow-onset increase in GluN2A in hippocampal synapses could be a homeostatic mechanism to normalize synaptic plasticity following fast-onset stress-induced facilitation.

Attentional bias toward aversive cues in PTSD has been hypothesized as being part of the dysfunction causing etiology and maintenance of PTSD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cognitive strategy underlying attentional bias in PTSD and whether normal cognitive processing is restored after a treatment suppressing core PTSD symptoms. Methods: Nineteen healthy controls were matched for age, sex and education to 19 PTSD patients. We used the emotional stroop and detection of target tasks, before and after an average of 4.1 sessions of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. Results: We found that on both tasks, patients were slower than controls in responding in the presence of emotionally negative words compared to neutral ones. After symptoms removal, patients no longer had attentional bias, and responded similarly to controls. Conclusion: These results support the existence of an attentional bias in PTSD patients due to a disengagement difficulty. There was also preliminary evidence that the disengagement was linked to PTSD symptomatology. It should be further explored whether attentional bias and PTSD involve common brain mechanisms.

Characteristics and Outcome After Hospitalization for Acute Right Heart Failure in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension	CIRCULATION-HEART FAILURE			English	Article						acute heart failure syndrome; pulmonary hypertension; right heart failure; cardiorenal syndrome; echocardiography	BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; TRICUSPID REGURGITATION; CARDIAC-OUTPUT; RENAL-FUNCTION; OF-CARDIOLOGY; ASSOCIATION; MORTALITY; PROGNOSIS; SURVIVAL; ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY	Background-Although much is known about the risk factors for poor outcome in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, much less is known about the syndrome of acute heart failure primarily affecting the right ventricle (acute right heart failure). Methods and Results-By using Stanford Hospital's pulmonary hypertension database, we identified consecutive acute right heart failure hospitalizations in patients with PAH. We used longitudinal regression analysis with the generalized estimating equations method to identify factors associated with an increased likelihood of 90-day mortality or urgent transplantation. From June 1999 to September 2009, 119 patients with PAH were hospitalized for acute right heart failure (207 episodes). Death or urgent transplantation occurred in 34 patients by 90 days of admission. Multivariable analysis identified a higher respiratory rate on admission (>20 breaths per minute; OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.5-7.8), renal dysfunction on admission (glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.2-6.3), hyponatremia (serum sodium <= 136 mEq/L; OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.7-7.9), and tricuspid regurgitation severity (OR, 2.5 per grade; 95% CI, 1.2-5.5) as independent factors associated with an increased likelihood of death or urgent transplantation. Conclusions-These results highlight the high mortality after hospitalizations for acute right heart failure in patients with PAH. Factors identifiable within hours of hospitalization may help predict the likelihood of death or the need for urgent transplantation in patients with PAH. (Circ Heart Fail. 2011;4:692-699.)

The phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT pathway is a crucial regulator of cellular processes including apoptosis. Thioredoxin 1, an inhibitor of tumor-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog, is overexpressed in many tumors. The objective of this study was to explore phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT pathway activation and regulation by thioredoxin 1 to identify potential therapeutic targets. Immunohistochemical analysis was done on tissue microarrays from tumor samples of 101 patients, using antibodies against phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, AKT, activated AKT, phosphatase and tensin homolog, phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog, thioredoxin 1, epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor and receptors (vascular endothelial growth factor 1 and vascular endothelial growth receptor 2), platelet-derived growth factor receptors, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2, phosphorylated 70-kd S6 protein kinase, 4E-binding protein 1, and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin. Using 3 neuroblastoma cell lines, we investigated cell viability with AKT-specific inhibitors (LY294002, RAD001) and thioredoxin 1 alone or in combination. We found activated AKT and AKT expressed in 97% and 98%, respectively, of neuroblastomas, despite a high expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog correlated with thioredoxin 1. AKT expression was greater in metastatic than primary tumors. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor type 2, vascular endothelial growth receptor 1, and downstream phosphorylated 70-kd S6 protein kinase were correlated with activated AKT. LY294002 and RAD001 significantly reduced AKT activity and cell viability and induced a G(1) cell cycle arrest. Thioredoxin 1 decreased cytotoxicity of AKT inhibitors and doxorubicin, up-regulated AKT activation, and induced cell growth. Thus, vascular endothelial growth receptor 1, tyrosine kinase receptor type 2, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and thioredoxin 1 emerged as preferentially committed to phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/AKT pathway activation as observed in neuroblastoma. Thioredoxin 1 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cell lines, Md108 and Md66, from the hemocytes of Malacosoma disstria (Lepidoptera) display aspects of plasma-free innate non-self activities	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Malacosoma; Hemocytes; Bacillus; Xenorhabdus; Lipopolysaccharides; Lipoteichoic acids	GALLERIA-MELLONELLA INSECTA; MANDUCA-SEXTA; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; PSEUDOPLUSIA-INCLUDENS; MEMBRANE SKELETON; FOREIGN SURFACES; LARVAL HEMOCYTES; NODULE FORMATION; C. INSECTA	The innate non-self response systems of the deciduous tree pest, the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria has been documented by us in terms of in vitro and in vivo reactions towards the Gram-positive nonpathogenic bacterium, Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative pathogenic microbe, Xenorhabdus nematophila and their respective surface antigens, lipopoteichoic acids (LTA) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). These studies, often conducted in whole and diluted hemolymph, preclude examination of plasma-free cellular (hemocyte) responses. Plasma-free hemocytes as primary cultures are difficult to obtain. The floating cell line Md66 and attached cell line Md108 from M. disstria hemocytes were examined as a model for plasma-free M. disstria hemocyte non-self responses. Herein, it was established that although both lines differed from each other and from the primary hemocyte cultures of M. disstria in growth parameters, cell composition and sizes both cell lines displayed granular cell-like (GL) cells and plasmatocyte-like (PL) cells according to morphological criteria and to some extent antigenic similarities based on labeling with anti-Chrysodeixis includens hemocyte monoclonal antibodies. Hemocyte-specific neuroglian-like protein was detected on cells of both cell lines and in the primary hemocyte cultures albeit with staining patterns differing according to culture and cell types, confluency levels and cell-cell adhesion. Both cell lines bound B. subtilis and X. nematophila, the reaction extent varying with the cell line and its cell types. LPS damaged both cell types in the two cell lines whereas LTA enhanced the adhesion of Md66 GL cells to flask surfaces followed by PL cell adhesion. PL cells of both lines, like the primary cultures, phagocytosed FITC-labeled B. subtilis; only Md108 GL cells phagocytosed B. subtilis. In either case phagocytosis was always less in frequency and intensity than the primary cultures. Proteins released from the cell lines differed in pattern and magnitude but contained bacterial binding proteins that enhanced differential bacterial adhesion to both cell types in both cell lines: the GL cells both cultures, and those of granular cells in primary cultures, were more involved than the primary plasmatocytes and PL cells. Only Md66 cells possessed lysozyme and both cell types of both lines contained phenoloxidase. Neither enzyme type was released during early phase reaction with the bacteria. LPS inhibited phenoloxidase activity. The similarities and differences between the lines and primary cultures make Md66 and Md108 useful for the systematic examination of plasma-free cellular non-self reactions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This has stimulated interest in understanding the role of progranulin in the central nervous system, and in particular, how this relates to neurodegeneration. Progranulin has many roles outside the brain, including regulation of cellular proliferation, survival, and migration, in cancer, including cancers of the brain, in wound repair, and inflammation. It often acts through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phopshatidylinositol-3-kinases pathways. The neurobiology of progranulin has followed a similar pattern with proposed roles for progranulin (PGRN) in the central nervous system as a neuroprotective agent and in neuroinflammation. Here we review the structure, biology, and mechanism of progranulin action. By understanding PGRN in a wider context, we may be better able to delineate its roles in the normal brain and in neurodegenerative disease.	[Toh, Huishi; Chitramuthu, Babykumari P.; Bennett, Hugh P.

The latter is mediated by the nuclear translocation of the mitochondrial flavoprotein apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Nicotine has been shown to decrease A beta neurotoxicity via inhibition of caspase-dependent apoptosis, but it is unknown if its neuroprotection is mediated through caspase-independent pathways. In the present study, pre-treatment with nicotine in rat cortical neuronal culture markedly reduced A beta(1-42) induced neuronal death. This effect was accompanied by a significant reduction of mitochondrial AIF release and its subsequent nuclear translocation as well as significant inhibition of cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation. Pre-treatment with selective alpha 7nicotinic acetylcholine receptor(nAChR) antagonist (methyllycaconitine), but not the alpha 4 nAChR antagonist (dihydro-beta-erythroidine), could prevent the neuroprotective effect of nicotine on AIF release/translocation, suggesting that nicotine inhibits the caspase-independent death pathway in a alpha 7 nAChR-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the neuroprotective action of nicotine on AIF release/translocation was suppressed by LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. Pre-treatment with nicotine significantly restored Akt phosphorylation, an effector of PI3K, in A beta(1-42)-treated neurons. These findings indicate that the alpha 7 nAChR activation and PI3K/Akt transduction signaling contribute to the neuroprotective effects of nicotine against A beta-induced cell death by modulating caspase-independent death pathways.

The Natural History of Trauma-Related Coagulopathy: Implications for Treatment	JOURNAL OF TRAUMA-INJURY INFECTION AND CRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Coagulopathy; Trauma; Brain injury; Resuscitation	DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION; SEVERE INTRAABDOMINAL HEMORRHAGE; LIFE-THREATENING COAGULOPATHY; DAMAGE CONTROL RESUSCITATION; PROTEIN-C PATHWAY; BRAIN-INJURY; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE; PATIENT HYPOTHERMIA; BLOOD-COAGULATION; ELDERLY-PATIENTS	Background: Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death in trauma patients and coagulopathy is a significant contributor. Although the exact mechanisms of trauma-associated coagulopathy (TAC) are incompletely understood, hemostatic resuscitation strategies have been developed to treat TAC. Our study sought to identify which trauma patients develop TAC and the factors associated with its development, to describe the natural history of TAC, and to identify patients with TAC who may not require hemostatic resuscitation. Methods: Patients with early coagulopathy (International Normalized Ratio >1.3) who were admitted directly from the scene within 1 hour of injury were identified in our institutional trauma registry. We analyzed these data for the presence of TAC, predictors of early and delayed TAC, and evolution of TAC during the first 24 hours of admission. Results: Of 2,473 patients, 290 (12%) had early TAC (International Normalized Ratio >1.3) and 271 (11%) developed delayed TAC. Multivariate analysis identified female gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.25 [1.11-1.41]), lower pH (OR 0.08 [0.015-0.47]), lower hemoglobin (OR 0.96 [0.95-0.97]), lower temperature (OR 0.82 [0.70-0.95]), and blunt mechanism (OR 0.49 [0.33-0.71]) as factors significantly associated with development of early TAC. Progression of early TAC occurred in 64%, and these patients had more severe abdominal injury and received more emergency room crystalloid. Of patients with early TAC who did not receive fresh frozen plasma, only 49% developed worsening coagulopathy. Patients with isolated intracranial hemorrhage had higher rates of bleeding progression (75% vs. 20%, p < 0.005) in the presence of early TAC. Conclusions: TAC may appear in an early or delayed form and its presence and progression are associated with a number of identifiable factors. Al-though TAC commonly progresses, it also resolves spontaneously in many patients. Further research is required to identify which patients with TAC require hemostatic treatment, although those with intracranial hemorrhages seem to warrant aggressive therapy.

In contrast, accumulating evidence suggests that schizophrenia is a developmental disorder in which brain abnormalities may occur even before birth. This has brought the major challenge to explain such discrepancy of brain deficits occurring during prenatal period and emergence of symptoms during adulthood. A number of ideas have been proposed to explain delayed emergence of symptoms at adulthood in relation to maturational processes of various brain systems during adolescence. However, these still lack clear relationship to prenatal deficits. Thus, a key to better understand the pathology of schizophrenia is to unveil a theory or model that can explain the relationship between prenatal deficits and post-pubertal onset of symptoms. Here we propose a novel hypothesis, along with discussion of several lines of evidences supporting it, that schizophrenia may not be a disorder in a strict sense, but rather be understood as the biological state occurring as consequence of adaptation to severe environmental conditions during the prenatal periods, which explains the relationship between prenatal developmental deficits and the postnatal maturational process for onset of symptoms.

Influence of Birth Weight on Internalizing Traits Modulated by Serotonergic Genes	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						genes; genomic polymorphisms; serotonin; internalizing traits; child development; birth weight	BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE-DISORDER; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS; 2A RECEPTOR GENE; TRANSPORTER GENE; HPA AXIS; TRYPTOPHAN HYDROXYLASE-2; ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT; ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION; SUSCEPTIBILITY GENE	OBJECTIVE: Fetal growth predicts childhood behavioral problems associated with brain serotonergic systems. We hypothesized that allelic variations in genes involved in serotonergic function would moderate associations between birth weight (BW) and internalizing traits in childhood. METHODS: The Child Behavior Checklist was administered to 545 healthy Singaporean children at 8 to 12 years. BW, corrected for gestational age, and candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TPH2, HTR2A, and SCL6A4 genes were investigated. RESULTS: There was no significant main effect of BW on internalizing T scores (F = 1.08; P = .36). After multiple corrections, significant main effects on internalizing T scores were found for HTR2A rs2296972 (adjusted: F = 2.85; P = .019) and HTR2A rs6313 (adjusted: F = 5.91; P = .0002). Significant interactions were found between BW and SNPs for the TPH2 gene (rs2171363: P = .008; rs7305115: P = .007) and the HTR2A gene (rs2770304: P = .001; rs6313: P = .026) for internalizing T scores. The CC genotype of TPH2 rs2171363, GG genotype of TPH2 rs7305115, CC genotype of HTR2A rs2770304, and CC genotype of HTR2A rs6313 were associated with reduced internalizing scores for children born in the quartile above the midpoint. No significant main effects or interactions were found for SCL6A4 SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that sequence variations in genes involved in serotonergic functions modulate relationships between BW and internalizing traits and might be candidates for plasticity mechanisms that determine individual differences in responses to environmental influences over the course of development.

We present, to our knowledge, the first prospective study combining cortical thickness and voxel-based morphometry in adults diagnosed as having ADHD in childhood. Objectives: To test whether adults with combined-type childhood ADHD exhibit cortical thinning and decreased gray matter in regions hypothesized to be related to ADHD and to test whether anatomic differences are associated with a current ADHD diagnosis, including persistent vs remitting ADHD. Design: Cross-sectional analysis embedded in a 33-year prospective follow-up at a mean age of 41.2 years. Setting: Research outpatient center. Participants: We recruited probands with ADHD from a cohort of 207 white boys aged 6 to 12 years. Male comparison participants (n=178) were free ofADHD in childhood. We obtained magnetic resonance images in 59 probands and 80 comparison participants (28.5% and 44.9% of the original samples, respectively). Main Outcome Measures: Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry and vertexwise cortical thickness analyses. Results: The cortex was significantly thinner in ADHD probands than in comparison participants in the dorsal attentional network and limbic areas (false discovery rate <0.05, corrected). In addition, gray matter was significantly decreased in probands in the right caudate, right thalamus, and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. Probands with persistent ADHD (n=17) did not differ significantly from those with remitting ADHD (n=26) (false discovery rate < 0.05). At uncorrected P < .05, individuals with remitting ADHD had thicker cortex relative to those with persistent ADHD in the medial occipital cortex, insula, parahippocampus, and prefrontal regions. Conclusions: Anatomic gray matter reductions are observable in adults with childhood ADHD, regardless of the current diagnosis. The most affected regions underpin top-down control of attention and regulation of emotion and motivation. Exploratory analyses suggest that diagnostic remission may result from compensatory maturation of prefrontal, cerebellar, and thalamic circuitry.

Influential neurocognitive models relevant to atypical perception (i.e., weak central coherence, enhanced perceptual functioning) can, to differing degrees, account for these findings. However, the neural underpinnings mediating atypical visuospatial autistic perception have yet to be elucidated. Methods: In the present study, we used a lateral masking paradigm to assess the functional integrity of lateral interactions mediating visuospatial information processing within early visual areas of autistic (n = 18) and nonautistic (n = 15) observers. Detection thresholds were measured for centrally presented Gabor targets flanked collinearly at different distances (experiment 1) and flanked orthogonally at different contrasts (experiment 2). Results: Autistic and nonautistic groups showed increased target sensitivity when the distance between collinear targets and flankers was small (3 lambda) but not large (6 lambda). However, the effect of small-distance facilitation was significantly greater for the autistic group. In addition, we observed a group-specific effect of contrast: in the autistic group, target sensitivity was enhanced by low flanker contrasts of both 5% and 10% luminance difference, whereas for the nonautistic group, this effect occurred at 10% contrast only. Conclusions: These findings support the idea that atypical visuospatial perception in autismmayoriginate from altered lateral connectivity within primary visual areas, differentially affecting perception at the earliest levels of feature extraction.

In age-related macular degeneration and diabetes, for example, dysregulation of lipid metabolism is closely associated with disease onset and progression. At the same time, some lipids and their metabolites can exert beneficial effects in the same disorders. This review summarises our current knowledge of the contributions of lipids to both the pathogenesis and treatment of neovascular eye disease. The clinical entities covered are exudative age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, with a special emphasis on the potential therapeutic effects of omega 3- (also known as n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Using an oxygen limitation model and a BOLD signal model, we obtain a transcendental equation relating CBF and CMRO (2) changes with the corresponding BOLD signal, which is solved in terms of the Lambert W function. Inserting this result in the dynamic bioheat equation describing the rate of temperature changes in the brain, we obtain a nonautonomous ordinary differential equation that depends on the BOLD response, which is solved numerically for each brain voxel. Temperature maps obtained from a real BOLD dataset registered in an attention to visual motion experiment were calculated, obtaining temperature variations in the range: (-0.15, 0.1) which is consistent with experimental results. The statistical analysis revealed that significant temperature activations have a similar distribution pattern than BOLD activations. An interesting difference was the activation of the precuneus in temperature maps, a region involved in visuospatial processing, an effect that was not observed on BOLD maps. Furthermore, temperature maps were more localized to gray matter regions than the original BOLD maps, showing less activated voxels in white matter and cerebrospinal fluid.

Music is particularly well suited for studying neuronal plasticity in the human brain because musical training is more complex and multimodal than most other daily life activities, and because prospective and professional musicians usually pursue the training with high and long-lasting commitment. Therefore, music has increasingly been used as a tool for the investigation of human cognition and its underlying brain mechanisms. Music relates to many brain functions like perception, action, cognition, emotion, learning and memory and therefore music is an ideal tool to investigate how the human brain is working and how different brain functions interact. Novel findings have been obtained in the field of induced cortical plasticity by musical training. The positive effects, which music in its various forms has in the healthy human brain are not only important in the framework of basic neuroscience, but they also will strongly affect the practices in neuro-rehabilitation.

Species vary widely in their rates of innovation, and these differences can be quantified using counts of novel behavior observed in the wild. One of the assumed benefits of innovativeness is that it allows species to exploit a wider variety of habitats and foods, enhancing survival when resources are in shortage or when individuals invade new environments. However, the relationship between innovation propensity and ecological generalism lacks firm empirical support. Moreover, innovativeness does not only imply benefits but may also lead to higher risks incurred in the wide array of habitats exploited. In this study, we test whether innovative species exploit a wider variety of habitats and food types as well as face the potential risk of more predators as a consequence of their ecological generalism. Using data for 193 North American bird species in a phylogenetically informed analysis, we find a significant positive relationship between innovation rate and habitat generalism, but not diet breadth. Although habitat generalism is also associated with exposure to a wider variety of predators, there is no direct relationship between innovation rate and predation. Our results suggest that although innovators use a wider variety of habitats, they are not necessarily diet generalists, challenging the classic view that feeding generalism is equivalent to feeding flexibility.

To test the hypothesis that orgasm is related to autonomic hyperreflexia (AHR) in individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI). SUBJECTS AND METHODS A total of 97 men with SCI, of whom 50 showed AHR at ejaculation and 39 showed no AHR, were compared. Ejaculation was obtained through natural stimulation, vibrostimulation or vibrostimulation combined with midodrine (5-25 mg). Cardiovascular measures were recorded before, at, and after each test. Responses to the questionnaire were divided into four categories: cardiovascular, muscular, autonomic and dysreflexic sensations. RESULTS Significantly more sensations were described at ejaculation than with sexual stimulation alone. Men with SCI who experienced AHR at ejaculation reported significantly more cardiovascular, muscular, autonomic and dysreflexic responses than those who did not. There was no difference between men with complete and those with incomplete lesions. CONCLUSIONS The findings show that the questionnaire is a useful tool to assess orgasm and to guide patients in identifying the bodily sensations that accompany or build up to orgasm. The findings also support the hypothesis that orgasm may be related to the presence of AHR in individuals with SCI. Data from able-bodied men also suggest that AHR could be related to orgasm, as increases in blood pressure are observed at ejaculation along with cardiovascular, autonomic and muscular sensations.

Methods: Retrospective cohort study using the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network including patients presenting with an acute ischemic stroke between 2003 and 2008. Preexisting dementia was defined as any type of dementia that was present prior to the index stroke case. Palliative patients were excluded. Demographic information, clinical presentation, selected process measures (e. g., thrombolysis, admission to stroke unit, carotid imaging, stroke prevention), pneumonia, death, disability, and disposition at discharge were analyzed. Results: Among 9,304 eligible patients with an acute ischemic stroke, 702 (9.1%) had a history of dementia. Patients with dementia were older (mean age 81 vs 70 years; p < 0.001), had more severe strokes (Canadian Neurological Scale score < 4, 20.7% vs 10.5%; p < 0.001), and were more likely to have atrial fibrillation (22.8% vs 15.3%; p < 0.001) than those without dementia. Patients with dementia were slightly less likely to be admitted to a stroke unit (63% vs 67.6%; odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.96) or to receive thrombolysis (10.5% vs 15.7%; OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81). There were no differences in other performance measures. Patients with preexisting dementia had higher disability at discharge (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.64-3.87) and were less likely to be discharged to their prestroke place of residence (24% vs 45%; p < 0.001). Conclusions: In patients with stroke, preexisting dementia is associated with high rates of disability and institutionalization, representing an increasing challenge for the health care system.

The purpose of the present article was to provide guidance to clinicians on the clinical management of extrapyramidal side effects of second-generation antipsychotics. METHODS: Published literature, key informant interviews, and discussions with panel members and stakeholder partners were used to identify key clinical areas of guidance and preferences on format for the present recommendations. Draft recommendations were presented to a guideline panel. Members of the guideline panel evaluated the information gathered from the systematic review of the literature and used a nominal group process to reach a consensus on treatment recommendations. A description of the neurological abnormalities commonly seen with antipsychotic medications is provided, as well as recommendations on how to examine and quantify these abnormalities. A stepwise approach to the management of neurological abnormalities is provided. RESULTS: Several different types of extrapyramidal symptoms can be seen secondary to antipsychotic use in children including neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia, neuroleptic-induced akathisia, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia and tardive akathisia, and withdrawal dyskinesias. The overwhelming majority of evidence on the treatment of antipsychotic-induced movement disorders comes from adult patients with schizophrenia. Given the scarcity of paediatric data, recommendations were made with reference to both the adult and paediatric literature. Given the limitations in the generalizability of data from adult subjects to children, these recommendations should be considered on the basis of expert opinion, rather than evidence based. CONCLUSION: Clinicians must be aware of the potential of second-generation antipsychotics to induce neurological side effects, and should exercise a high degree of vigilance when prescribing these medications.

Knowledge of the stakes of the network form of organization is critical in deciding whether or not to implement a TBI network to improve the continuity of TBI care. Goals of the study: To report the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a TBI network and to consider these elements in a discussion about whether networks are a suitable solution to fragmented TBI care. Methods: In-depth interviews with 12 representatives of network organization members. Interviews were qualitatively analyzed using the EGIPSS model of performance. Results: The majority of elements reported were related to the network's adaptation to its environment and more precisely to its capacity to acquire resources. The issue of value maintenance also received considerable attention from participants. Discussion: The network form of organization seems particularly sensitive to environmental issues, such as resource acquisition and legitimacy. The authors suggest that the network form of organization is a suitable way to increase the continuity of TBI care if the following criteria are met: (1) expectations toward network effectiveness to increase continuity of care are moderate and realistic; (2) sufficient resources are devoted to the design, implementation, and maintenance of the network; (3) a network's existence and actions are deemed legitimate by community and organization member partners; and (4) there is a good collaborative climate between the organizations.

In the present study we investigated whether these factors might affect the role of dopamine (DA). Using the acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion method (APTD), DA synthesis was transiently decreased in three groups of abstinent smokers (n = 47): (1) early low-frequency smokers, who had smoked a maximum of five cigarettes per day for less than one year, (2) stable low-frequency smokers smoking at the same level as early low-frequency smokers for at least 3 years, and (3) stable high-frequency smokers, who smoked a minimum of 10 or more cigarettes per day for at least 5 years. Motivation to obtain tobacco was measured using a progressive ratio breakpoint schedule for nicotine-containing and de-nicotinized cigarettes. Compared with a nutritionally balanced control mixture, APTD decreased the self-administration of nicotine-containing cigarettes, and this occurred in all three groups of smokers. The results suggest that DA influenced the willingness to sustain effort for nicotine reward, and this was seen in participant; at all three levels of cigarette addiction. In the transition from sporadic to addicted use, the role of DA in the motivation to seek drug may change less than previously proposed.

To evaluate the specific role of VMAT2 in 5-HT neurons, we produced a conditional ablation of VMAT2 under control of the serotonin transporter (slc6a4) promoter. VMAT2(sert-cre) mice showed a major (-95%) depletion of 5-HT levels in the brain with no major alterations in other monoamines. Raphe neurons contained no 5-HT immunoreactivity in VMAT2(sert-cre) mice but developed normal innervations, as assessed by both tryptophan hydroxylase 2 and 5-HT transporter labeling. Increased 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor coupling to G protein, as assessed with agonist-stimulated [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding, was observed in the raphe area, indicating an adaptive change to reduced 5-HT transmission. Behavioral evaluation in adult VMAT2(sert-cre) mice showed an increase in escape-like reactions in response to tail suspension and anxiolytic-like response in the novelty-suppressed feeding test. In an aversive ultrasound-induced defense paradigm, VMAT2(sert-cre) mice displayed a major increase in escape-like behaviors. Wild-type-like defense phenotype could be rescued by replenishing intracellular 5-HT stores with chronic pargyline (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) treatment. Pargyline also allowed some form of 5-HT release, although in reduced amounts, in synaptosomes from VMAT2(sert-cre) mouse brain. These findings are coherent with the notion that 5-HT has an important role in anxiety, and provide new insights into the role of endogenous 5-HT in defense behaviors.

We thus tested the hypothesis that persistent PSI inhibition and neuronal death are causally linked. Neuronal viability strongly correlated with both protein synthesis and levels of eukaryotic (translation) initiation factor 4G1 (eIF4G1). We determined that in vitro ischemia activated calpain, which degraded eIF4G1. Overexpression of the calpain inhibitor calpastatin or eIF4G1 resulted in increased protein synthesis and increased neuronal viability compared with controls. The neuroprotective effect of eIF4G1 overexpression was due to restoration of cap-dependent protein synthesis, as well as protein synthesis-independent mechanisms, as inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not completely prevent the protective effect of eIF4G1 overexpression. In contrast, shRNA-mediated silencing of eIF4G1 exacerbated ischemia-induced neuronal injury, suggesting eIF4G1 is necessary for maintenance of neuronal viability. Finally, calpain inhibition following global ischemia in vivo blocked decreases in eIF4G1, facilitated protein synthesis, and increased neuronal viability in ischemia-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons. Collectively, these data demonstrate that calpain-mediated degradation of a translation initiation factor, eIF4G1, is a cause of both persistent PSI and neuronal death.	[Bennett, Michael V.

A Randomized Comparison Between Subepineural and Conventional Ultrasound-Guided Popliteal Sciatic Nerve Block	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							INTRANEURAL INJECTION; REGIONAL ANESTHESIA; FOSSA; GUIDANCE; INJURY; BIFURCATION; DEFICITS	Background: This prospective, randomized, observer-blinded trial compared a subepineural sciatic injection at the neural bifurcation (SUB group) and separate postbifurcation injections around the tibial and peroneal nerves. Methods: Ultrasound-guided posterior popliteal sciatic nerve block was carried out in 50 patients. In the group that had separate postbifurcation injections around the tibial and peroneal nerves, the volume of local anesthetic (LA) (30 mL of lidocaine 1%-bupivacaine 0.25%- epinephrine 5 mu g/mL) was divided equally between the tibial and peroneal nerves. In the SUB group, the 2 divisions were identified exactly at the neural bifurcation. In this location, both nerves can still be found inside a common epineural sheath. The entire volume of LA was injected between the 2 branches, inside the common sheath. A blinded observer recorded the success rate (complete sensory block at 30 mins) and onset time. The performance time, number of needle passes, and adverse events were also recorded. Total anesthesia-related time was defined as the sum of performance and onset times. Results: Compared with targeted injections around the tibial and peroneal divisions, a subepineural injection resulted in a higher success rate (84% vs 56%; P = 0.032) as well as improved efficiency (decreased performance/onset/total anesthesia-related times and fewer needle passes; all P <= 0.028). In the SUB group, we observed no instance of neural swelling. In 3 subjects randomized to separate injections, sonographic swelling of the tibial nerve occurred after the injection of 2 mL of LA. The needle was carefully withdrawn, and the injection completed uneventfully. In 45 patients, follow-up 1 week after the surgery revealed no sensory or motor deficit. Five subjects were lost to follow-up. Conclusions: Compared with separate injections around the tibial and peroneal divisions, a single subepineural injection at the neural bifurcation provides a higher success rate and requires shorter performance, onset, and total anesthesia-related times. Further studies are required to validate the safety of the subepineural technique.	[Tran, De Q.

A Context for Normalizing Impulsiveness at Work for Adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (Combined Type)	ARCHIVES OF CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Adult ADHD; Executive functions; Videogame; Motivational; Incidental retrospective memory; Errors of commission	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; 6 ELEMENTS TEST; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; REWARD ANTICIPATION; PROSPECTIVE MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DOPAMINE RELEASE; ADHD; CHILDREN	Impaired executive function and impulsiveness or intolerance to boredom in adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are thought to compromise performance at work. Several task parameters help people with ADHD to perform better on computerized cognitive tasks, namely reduced response-to-stimulus interval, discriminative feedback, or a format resembling a videogame. However, still very little is known about how these contexts might be helpful in a real work environment. We developed a computerized task resembling a fast-paced videogame with no response-to-stimulus interval and constant and diverse discriminative error feedback. The task included several measurements of high-order executive function (planning, working memory, and prospective memory) formatted as a single multitask simulating occupational activities (SOA). We also administered the Continuous Performance Test-II (CPT-II), a very simple vigilance task without discriminative feedback and with long response-to-stimulus intervals. We tested 30 adults answering to DSM-IV criteria of ADHD (combined type) and 30 IQ-matched adults without ADHD. As has been reported many times, the ADHD participants made significantly more errors of commission than the control participants on the CPT-II, whereas the two groups made the same number of errors of commission on the SOA. The ADHD group also sought discriminative feedback significantly more actively on the SOA than the control group and performed at par with the control group in all respects. There was no speed/accuracy trade-off, nor was there any evidence of other costs of normalization on the SOA. Impulsiveness in adult ADHD is compensable on a task simulating the work environment.

Genetic studies have identified mutations in the CACNA1,ATP1A2 and SCN1A genes in the rare familial hemiplegic migraine. Recently, a mutation in the KCNK18 gene, encoding the TRESK two-pore domain potassium channel, was described in a large family with migraine with aura. This review will elaborate on the possible role of the TRESK channel in regulating neuronal excitability, its role in migraine pathogenesis, and on promising therapeutic opportunities targeting this channel.

We conducted an international study of WBRT (37.5 Gy in 15 fractions) and SRS (15-21 Gy) with the addition of MGd (5 mg/kg preceding each fraction beginning week 2). The primary endpoint was to evaluate the rate of irreversible grade 3 or any grade >= 4 neurotoxicity and establish feasibility in preparation for a phase III trial. Sixty-five patients were enrolled from 14 institutions, of which 45 (69%) received SRS with MGd as intended and were available for evaluation. Grade >= 3 neurotoxicity attributable to radiation therapy within 3 months of SRS was seen in 2 patients (4.4%), including generalized weakness and radionecrosis requiring surgical management. Immediately following the course of MGd plus WBRT, new brain metastases were detected in 11 patients (24.4%) at the time of the SRS treatment planning MRI. The actuarial incidence of neurologic progression at 6 months and 1 year was 17 and 20%, respectively. The median investigator-determined neurologic progression free survival and overall survival times were 8 (95% CI: 5-14) and 9 months (95% CI: 6-not reached), respectively. We observed a low rate of neurotoxicity, demonstrating that the addition of MGd does not increase the incidence or severity of neurologic complications from WBRT with SRS boost.

Experiment 1 isolated an ERP component, the sustained anterior negativity (SAN), that increased in amplitude with increasing memory load in ASTM using stimuli with equal duration at all memory loads. The SAN load effect found in Experiment 1, when pitch had to be remembered to perform the task, was absent in Experiment 2 using the same sounds when memory was not required. In Experiment 3, the memory task was performed without or with concurrent articulatory suppression during the retention interval to prevent rehearsal via an articulatory loop. Load-related effects observed in Experiment 1 were found again, whether participants engaged in concurrent suppression or not.

Methods: A cohort of epileptic pregnant women was identified within the Quebec Pregnancy Registry and was divided into three groups based on maternal AED use during pregnancy: AED monotherapy, AED polytherapy and no AED use. Results: Of the 349 pregnancies meeting eligibility criteria, 79.6% were exposed to AED monotherapy and 5.8% to polytherapy during pregnancy; 14.6% discontinued AED prior to pregnancy. The most commonly used AEDs were carbamazepine (29.9%) and valproic acid (19.7%); the most common AED polytherapy combination was carbamazepine combined with clobazam (2.5%). Of 111 deliveries in the group of women on monotherapy during pregnancy, 9.9% (n = 11) were born with major congenital malformations; in the group of women treated with polytherapy, 19.0% (n = 8 over 42) of babies had major congenital malformations compared to 20.0% in women who discontinued AEDs prior to pregnancy. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the majority of women suffering from epilepsy were treated with monotherapy rather than polytherapy during pregnancy. While most used other agents, an important number of women continued to use valproate in pregnancy despite the long standing evidence of its teratogenicity and increasing evidence of its neuro-toxicity to the fetus.

Moreover, the activity of both the CRH and dynorphin systems in CeA is altered by alcohol treatments, effects suggesting interactions between the CRH and dynorphin systems. Thus, the objectives of the present study were to investigate the effects of (1) activating CRH receptors (CRHRs) by microinjection of CRH in CeA and (2) blocking CRHRs by local microinjections of CRHR antagonists in the CeA on the alcohol-induced changes in the extracellular concentrations of dynorphin A1-8 with in vivo microdialysis experiments. Microdialysis probes with a microinjection port were implanted in the CeA of alcohol-naive Sprague-Dawley rats. Microinjections of CRH or antalarmin, a CRH receptor type 1 (CRHR1) antagonist, or anti-sauvagine-30, a CRH receptor type 2 (CRHR2) antagonist, at the level of CeA were followed by an intraperitoneal injection of either saline or 2.8 g ethanol/kg body weight. The content of dynorphin A1-8 was determined in dialyzate samples obtained prior to and following the various treatments using a specific radioimmunoassay. Activation of CRHRs in CeA induced an increase in the extracellular concentrations of dynorphin A1-8. Moreover, acute alcohol administration increased the extracellular concentrations of dynorphin A1-8 in CeA, an effect that was attenuated by blocking CRHR2 with anti-sauvagine-30 microinjection but not blocking CRHR1 with antalarmin microinjection. Therefore, the findings suggest an interaction between the CRH and dynorphin A1-8 systems at the level of CeA in response to acute alcohol exposure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We assessed the intensity of pain in 87 intellectually disabled surgical patients recruited in four Canadian and French hospitals in the pre- and post-operative settings using the GED-DI, a 100-mm visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and the Rosen sedation scale. The validity of the GED-DI was measured by the difference in scores between pre- and postoperative conditions. The checklist was made up of 30 items divided into seven subgroups. Items were rated from 0 to 3 for a total score ranging from 0 to 90 points. The mean (standard deviation) age of the patients was 17 (11) yr and the mean mental age 24.5 (24) months. The total GED-DI score was 6.1 (4.9) pre- and 13.4 (11.2) post-surgery (P < 0.001). All subgroups had a higher score after surgery (P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, comparing the absence of pain to mild pain scores and moderate to severe pain scores, showed a cutoff at 6 (mild pain) and 11 (moderate to severe pain). The French version of the NCCPC-PV can be used to assess pain in non-communicating patients with intellectual disabilities in a postoperative setting. It has good content validity, as the total pre-surgery score for the GED-DI was significantly lower than the postoperative score, and showed a good concurrent validity when compared to the VAS.

Astrocytes, in particular, play a critical and complex role in synapse development, maintenance, and plasticity. Likewise, neurons reciprocally influence astrocyte physiology. However, the molecular signaling events that enable astrocytes and neurons to effectively communicate with each other are only partially defined. Recent findings have revealed that Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and ephrins play an important role in contact-dependent neuron-glia communication at synapses. Upon binding, these two families of cell surface-associated proteins trigger bidirectional signaling events that regulate the structural and physiological properties of both neurons and astrocytes. This review will focus on the emerging role of Eph receptors and ephrins in neuron-astrocyte interaction at synapses and discuss implications for synaptic plasticity, behavior, and disease.

In the scanner, participants were successively presented with faces that varied in identity, viewpoint, both, or neither and performed a head size detection task independent of identity or viewpoint. In right fusiform face area (FFA), older adults failed to show adaptation to the same face repeatedly presented in the same view, which elicited the most adaptation in young adults. We also performed a multivariate analysis to examine correlations between whole-brain activation patterns and behavioral performance in a face-matching task tested outside the scanner. Despite poor neural adaptation in right FFA, high-performing older adults engaged the same face-processing network as high-performing young adults across conditions, except the one presenting a same facial identity across different viewpoints. Low-performing older adults used this network to a lesser extent. Additionally, high-performing older adults uniquely recruited a set of areas related to better performance across all conditions, indicating age-specific involvement of this added network. This network did not include the core ventral face-processing areas but involved the left inferior occipital gyrus, frontal, and parietal regions. Although our adaptation results show that the neuronal representations of the core face-preferring areas become less selective with age, our multivariate analysis indicates that older adults utilize a distinct network of regions associated with better face matching performance, suggesting that engaging this network may compensate for deficiencies in ventral face processing regions.

J	Hwang, H; Steinhauer, K				Hwang, Hyekyung; Steinhauer, Karsten			Phrase Length Matters: The Interplay between Implicit Prosody and Syntax in Korean "Garden Path" Sentences	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BRAIN POTENTIALS; POSITIVE SHIFT; WORD-ORDER; JAPANESE; BOUNDARIES; RESOLUTION; AMBIGUITY; COMPLEXITY; ATTACHMENT; DISCOURSE	In spoken language comprehension, syntactic parsing decisions interact with prosodic phrasing, which is directly affected by phrase length. Here we used ERPs to examine whether a similar effect holds for the on-line processing of written sentences during silent reading, as suggested by theories of "implicit prosody." Ambiguous Korean sentence beginnings with two distinct interpretations were manipulated by increasing the length of sentence-initial subject noun phrases (NPs). As expected, only long NPs triggered an additional prosodic boundary reflected by a closure positive shift (CPS) in ERPs. When sentence materials further downstream disambiguated the initially dispreferred interpretation, the resulting P600 component reflecting processing difficulties ("garden path" effects) was smaller in amplitude for sentences with long NPs. Interestingly, additional prosodic revisions required only for the short subject disambiguated condition-the delayed insertion of an implicit prosodic boundary after the subject NP-were reflected by a frontal P600-like positivity, which may be interpreted in terms of a delayed CPS brain response. These data suggest that the subvocally generated prosodic boundary after the long subject NP facilitated the recovery from a garden path, thus primarily supporting one of two competing theoretical frameworks on implicit prosody. Our results underline the prosodic nature of the cognitive processes underlying phrase length effects and contribute cross-linguistic evidence regarding the on-line use of implicit prosody for parsing decisions in silent reading.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that, in CeA, alcohol stimulates CRH release, which then stimulates beta-endorphin release. Rats were unilaterally implanted with a guide cannula to aim microdialysis probes in CeA. Experiment 1: rats received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of various ethanol doses (0.0, 2.0, 2.4, or 2.8 g ethanol/kg body weight) and microdialysates were sampled at 30-min intervals to determine the effects over time of acute alcohol on the extracellular CRH concentrations in CeA. Experiment 2: phosphate-buffered saline, CRH, or CRH receptor (CRHR) antagonists (antalarmin or anti-sauvagine-30) was microinjected into CeA followed by a saline or 2.8 g/kg ethanol IP injection to determine the effects of CRHR activation or blockade in CeA on the basal and alcohol-stimulated release of beta-endorphin. CRH and beta-endorphin dialysate contents were determined using specific radioimmunoassays. Acute alcohol induced a delayed increase in the extracellular CRH levels in CeA. Behavioural data showed no difference in locomotion between alcohol- and saline-treated rats. However, a transient increase in grooming was observed which did not correspond with alcohol-induced changes in CRH. Local CRH microinjections increased the extracellular beta-endorphin concentrations in CeA. CRHR1 and CRHR2 blockade with microinjections of antalarmin and anti-sauvagine-30, respectively, attenuated the alcohol-induced increase of extracellular beta-endorphin in CeA. Acute alcohol exerts indirect actions on CRH release and induced interactions of the CRH and beta-endorphin systems in CeA.

To decipher the organization of the local cholinergic circuitry in the spinal dorsal horn, we used transgenic mice expressing enchanced green fluorescent protein specifically in cholinergic neurons (ChAT::EGFP) and characterized the morphology, neurochemistry, and firing properties of the sparse population of cholinergic interneurons in this area. Three-dimensional reconstruction of lamina III ChAT::EGFP neurons based either on their intrinsic fluorescence or on intracellular labeling in live tissue demonstrated that these neurons have long and thin processes that grow preferentially in the dorsal direction. Their dendrites and axon are highly elongated in the rostrocaudal direction, beyond the limits of a single spinal segment. These unique morphological features suggest that dorsal horn cholinergic interneurons are the main contributors to the plexus of cholinergic processes located in lamina IIi, just dorsal to their cell bodies. In addition, immunostainings demonstrated that dorsal horn cholinergic interneurons in the mouse are gamma-aminobutyric acidergic and express nitric oxide synthase, as in rats. Finally, electrophysiological recordings from these neurons in spinal cord slices demonstrate that two-thirds of them have a repetitive spiking pattern with frequent rebound spikes following hyperpolarization. Altogether our results indicate that, although they are rare, the morphological and functional features of cholinergic neurons enable them to collect segmental information in superficial layers of the dorsal horn and to modulate it over several segments.

The need for therapies that can protect and/or improve mitochondrial function is obvious. However, the development of mitoprotective drugs has been hampered by a number of challenges, and there are at present no approved therapies for mitochondrial dysfunction. This article describes the original discovery, preclinical development, and clinical development of a novel class of small peptide molecules that selectively target the inner mitochondrial membrane and protect mitochondrial function. These compounds have the potential to be a paradigm-shifting approach to the treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction, which underlies many common diseases, including cardiorenal, neurologic, and metabolic disorders.

Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Five anaesthetized male New Zealand rabbits with a mean +/- SD weight of 3.2 +/- 0.2 kg. Methods After femoral nerve localization by electrostimulation, an injection catheter and a microdialysis probe were slowly and simultaneously inserted into a cannula left into place in the perineural region. Both were then secured into place, after removal of the cannula. At the end of the experiment, methylene blue was injected to confirm the distance from the femoral nerve during subsequent postmortem anatomical dissection of the injection site. Results Staining was adequate and the catheter found to be located within 4 mm of the femoral nerve in three out of five rabbits. Conclusions and clinical relevance This procedure allows direct implantation of a microdialysis probe near the injection site of LA during a femoral nerve block without loosing nerve localization accuracy. This procedure has been used successfully to monitor the regional pharmacokinetics of LA after a peripheral nerve block.

However, it usually requires sectioning the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve which may be associated with lateral cutaneous hypesthesia and neuroma formation. We asked whether an anterolateral skin incision to the knee would decrease the area of skin hypesthesia and associated postoperative discomfort. We randomized 69 knees to receive a TKA through either a midline or an anterolateral skin incision. We assessed skin sensitivity by application of the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament at 13 reference points at 6 weeks and 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The area of hypesthesia was measured using Mesurim Pro 9(A (R)) software. Patient knee ROM, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and WOMAC clinical score also were assessed. The area of hypesthesia was less after an anterolateral compared with a midline incision up to 1 year after surgery: the areas of hypesthesia were, respectively, 32 cm(2) versus 76 cm(2) at 6 weeks, 14 cm(2) versus 29 cm(2) at 6 months, and 7 cm(2) versus 19 cm(2) at 1 year. Clinical scores and knee ROM were similar in both groups at each followup. At 1 year, in the entire group we observed a correlation between a smaller area of paresthesia and better WOMAC and KOOS scores and greater knee flexion. Compared with the midline skin incision, the anterolateral incision is associated with fewer sensory disturbances and appears to be a reasonable alternative in TKA. Level I, therapeutic study.

Transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor by enhanced levels of endogenous angiotensin II contributes to the overexpression of Gi alpha proteins in vascular smooth muscle cells from SHR	CELLULAR SIGNALLING			English	Article						Angiotensin II; Gi alpha protein; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Oxidative Stress; VSMC; SHR	SPONTANEOUSLY-HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; NUCLEOTIDE REGULATORY PROTEIN; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; ALTERED EXPRESSION; MYOCARDIAL SARCOLEMMA; TYPE-1 RECEPTOR; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; MODULATION; ACTIVATION	We earlier showed that the increased expression of Gi proteins exhibited by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was attributed to the enhanced levels of endogenous endothelin. Since the levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) are also enhanced in VSMC from SHR, the present study was undertaken to examine the role of enhanced levels of endogenous Ang II in the overexpression of Gi alpha proteins in VSMC from SHR and to further explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increase. The enhanced expression of Gi alpha-2 and Gi alpha-3 proteins in VSMC from SHR compared to WKY was attenuated by the captopril, losartan and AG1478, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme. AT(1) receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respectively as well as by the siRNAs of AT1, cSrc and EGFR. The enhanced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by low concentrations of GTP gamma S (receptor-independent functions) and of inhibitory responses of hormones on adenylyl cyclase activity (receptor-dependent functions) in VSMC from SHR was also attenuated by losartan. Furthermore, the enhanced phosphorylation of EGFR in VSMC from SHR was also restored to control levels by captopril, losartan, PP2, a c-Src inhibitor and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) scavenger, whereas enhanced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was attenuated by captopril and losartan. Furthermore, NAC also restored the enhanced phosphorylation of c-Src in SHR to control levels. These results suggest that the enhanced levels of endogenous Ang II in VSMC from SHR, transactivate EGFR, which through MAP kinase signaling, enhance the expression of Gi alpha proteins and associated adenylyl cyclase signaling.

Long Timescale fMRI Neuronal Adaptation Effects in Human Amblyopic Cortex	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; DEFICIT; MECHANISMS; REPETITION; ADULTS; BRAIN; MAP	An investigation of long timescale (5 minutes) fMRI neuronal adaptation effects, based on retinotopic mapping and spatial frequency stimuli, is presented in this paper. A hierarchical linear model was developed to quantify the adaptation effects in the visual cortex. The analysis of data involved studying the retinotopic mapping and spatial frequency adaptation effects in the amblyopic cortex. Our results suggest that, firstly, there are many cortical regions, including V1, where neuronal adaptation effects are reduced in the cortex in response to amblyopic eye stimulation. Secondly, our results show the regional contribution is different, and it seems to start from V1 and spread to the extracortex regions. Thirdly, our results show that there is greater adaptation to broadband retinotopic mapping as opposed to narrowband spatial frequency stimulation of the amblyopic eye, and we find significant correlation between fMRI response and the magnitude of the adaptation effect, suggesting that the reduced adaptation may be a consequence of the reduced response to different stimuli reported for amblyopic eyes.

The N250 brain potential to personally familiar and newly learned faces and objects	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERP's; face recognition; object recognition; familiar faces; N170; N250	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; OWN FACE; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; RECOGNITION; REPRESENTATIONS; ERP; ACQUISITION; ADAPTATION; PERCEPTION; EXPERTISE	Studies employing event-related potentials have shown that when participants are monitoring for a novel target face, the presentation of their own face elicits an enhanced negative brain potential in posterior channels approximately 250 ms after stimulus onset. Here, we investigate whether the own face N250 effect generalizes to other highly familiar objects, specifically, images of the participant's own dog and own car. In our experiments, participants were asked to monitor for a pre-experimentally unfamiliar target face (Joe), a target dog (Experiment1: Joe's Dog) or a target car (Experiment 2: Joe's Car). The target face and object stimuli were presented with non-target foils that included novel face and object stimuli, the participant's own face, their own dog (Experiment 1), and their own car (Experiment 2). The consistent findings across the two experiments were the following: (1) the N250 potential differentiated the target faces and objects from the non-target face and object foils and (2) despite being non-targets, the own face and own objects produced an N250 response that was equal in magnitude to the target faces and objects by the end of the experiment. Thus, as indicated by its response to personally familiar and recently familiarized faces and objects, the N250 component is a sensitive index of individuated representations in visual memory .

This field, at the frontier of host/guest chemistry and pharmacology, has met a renewed interest in the past decade due to the clinical success of several sequestrants, like sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel (R)) or sugammadex (Bridion (R)). In many instances, multivalent binding by the macromolecular drugs can modify the properties of the substrate, and may prevent it from reaching its site of action and/or trigger a biological response. From small (e. g., ions) to larger substrates (e. g., bacteria and cells), this review presents the state-of-the-art of macromolecular binders and provides detailed illustrative examples of recent developments bearing much promise for future pharmaceutical applications.

However, it remains unclear how this volumetric decline correlates with age-related changes in whole-brain activity during context encoding, and subsequent context retrieval. In the current study we examine this. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data in young and older adults during the encoding of item, spatial context and temporal context. HH volume and subsequent retrieval performance was measured in all participants. In young adults only there was a positive three-way correlation between larger HH volumes, better memory retrieval, and increased activity in right hippocampus, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and midline brain regions during episodic encoding. In contrast, older adults exhibited a positive three-way association between HH volume, generalized activity in bilateral hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC across all encoding tasks, and subsequent spatial context retrieval. Young adults also engaged this network, but only during the most difficult temporal context encoding task and activity in this network correlated with subsequent temporal context retrieval. We conclude that age-related volumetric reductions in HH disrupted the structure-function association between the hippocampus and activity in the first general encoding network recruited by young adults. Instead, older adults recruited those brain regions young adults only engaged for the most difficult temporal task, at lower difficulty levels. This altered pattern of association correlated with spatial context retrieval in older adults, but was not sufficient to maintain context memory abilities overall.

Spinal Cord Toll-Like Receptor 4 Mediates Inflammatory and Neuropathic Hypersensitivity in Male But Not Female Mice	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NERVE INJURY; MELANOCORTIN-1 RECEPTOR; INDUCED HYPERALGESIA; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; INNATE IMMUNITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; RAT MODEL; PAIN; ANALGESIA; TLR4	The innate immune system is increasingly appreciated to play an important role in the mediation of chronic pain, and one molecule implicated in this process is the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here, using pharmacological and genetic manipulations, we found that activating TLR4 in the spinal cord, with the agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS), causes robust mechanical allodynia but only in male mice. Spinal LPS had no pain-producing effect in female mice. TLR4 also has a sex-specific role in inflammatory (complete Freund's adjuvant) and neuropathic (spared nerve injury) pain: pain behaviors were TLR4 dependent in males but TLR4 independent in females. The sex differences appear to be specific to the spinal cord, as LPS administered to the brain or the hindpaw produces equivalent allodynia in both sexes, and specific to pain, as intrathecal LPS produces equivalent hypothermia in both sexes. The involvement of TLR4 in pain behaviors in male mice is dependent on testosterone, as shown by gonadectomy and hormone replacement. We found no sex differences in spinal Tlr4 gene expression at baseline or after LPS, suggesting the existence of parallel spinal pain-processing circuitry in female mice not involving TLR4.

Expansion of MT Neurons Excitatory Receptive Fields during Covert Attentive Tracking	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MULTIPLE-OBJECT TRACKING; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; CORTICAL AREA MT; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; NORMALIZATION MODEL; TASK-DIFFICULTY; MOVING TARGETS; MODULATION; RESPONSES	Primates can attentively track moving objects while keeping gaze stationary. The neural mechanisms underlying this ability are poorly understood. We investigated this issue by recording responses of neurons in area MT of two rhesus monkeys while they performed two different tasks. During the Attend-Fixation task, two moving random dot patterns (RDPs) translated across a screen at the same speed and in the same direction while the animals directed gaze to a fixation spot and detected a change in its luminance. During the Tracking task, the animals kept gaze on the fixation spot and attentively tracked the two RDPs to report a change in the local speed of one of the patterns' dots. In both conditions, neuronal responses progressively increased as the RDPs entered the neurons' receptive field (RF), peaked when they reached its center, and decreased as they translated away. This response profile was well described by a Gaussian function with its center of gravity indicating the RF center and its flanks the RF excitatory borders. During Tracking, responses were increased relative to Attend-Fixation, causing the Gaussian profiles to expand. Such increases were proportionally larger in the RF periphery than at its center, and were accompanied by a decrease in the trial-to-trial response variability (Fano factor) relative to Attend-Fixation. These changes resulted in an increase in the neurons' performance at detecting targets at longer distances from the RF center. Our results show that attentive tracking dynamically changes MT neurons' RF profiles, ultimately improving the neurons' ability to encode the tracked stimulus features.

Wnt Signaling Mediates Pathological Vascular Growth in Proliferative Retinopathy	CIRCULATION			English	Article						angiogenesis; retinopathy; vasculopathy	FAMILIAL EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; OXYGEN-INDUCED RETINOPATHY; NORRIE-DISEASE; ENDOTHELIAL-CADHERIN; RETINAL NEOVASCULARIZATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; TUMOR-GROWTH; MOUSE MODEL; VESSEL LOSS	Background-Ischemic proliferative retinopathy, characterized by pathological retinal neovascularization, is a major cause of blindness in working-age adults and children. Defining the molecular pathways distinguishing pathological neovascularization from normal vessels is critical to controlling these blinding diseases with targeted therapy. Because mutations in Wnt signaling cause defective retinal vasculature in humans with some characteristics of the pathological vessels in retinopathy, we investigated the potential role of Wnt signaling in pathological retinal vascular growth in proliferative retinopathy. Methods and Results-In this study, we show that Wnt receptors (Frizzled4 and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein5 [Lrp5]) and activity are significantly increased in pathological neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced proliferative retinopathy. Loss of Wnt coreceptor Lrp5 and downstream signaling molecule dishevelled2 significantly decreases the formation of pathological retinal neovascularization in retinopathy. Loss of Lrp5 also affects retinal angiogenesis during development and formation of the blood-retinal barrier, which is linked to significant downregulation of tight junction protein claudin5 in Lrp5(-/-) vessels. Blocking claudin5 significantly suppresses Wnt pathway-driven endothelial cell sprouting in vitro and developmental and pathological vascular growth in retinopathy in vivo. Conclusions-These results demonstrate an important role of Wnt signaling in pathological vascular development in retinopathy and show a novel function of Cln5 in promoting angiogenesis.

In addition, the impact of therapies targeting mast cells proliferation, differentiation and degranulation on psychic symptoms of depression have never been investigated. Our objective was to determine the prevalence and to describe features of depression in a large cohort of mastocytosis patients (n = 288) and to investigate the therapeutic impact of the protein kinase inhibitor masitinib in depression symptoms. The description of depression was based on the analysis of a database with Hamilton scores using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Efficacy of masitinib therapy was evaluated using non parametric Wilcoxon test for paired data within a three months period (n = 35). Our results show that patients with indolent mastocytosis present an elevated prevalence of depression (64%). Depression was moderate in 56% but severe in 8% of cases. Core symptoms (such as psychic anxiety, depressed mood, work and interests) characterized depression in mastocytosis patients. Masitinib therapy was associated with significant improvement (67% of the cases) of overall depression, with 75% of recovery cases. Global Quality of Life slightly improved after masitinib therapy and did not predicted depression improvement. In conclusion, depression is very frequent in mastocytosis patients and masitinib therapy is associated with the reduction its psychic experiences. We conclude that depression in mastocytosis may originate from processes related to mast cells activation. Masitinib could therefore be a useful treatment for mastocytosis patients with depression and anxiety symptoms.

The loss of orexin peptides or functional OX2R has been shown to cause the sleep disorder, narcolepsy. Since the regulation of orexin receptors remains largely undefined, we searched for novel protein partners of the intracellular tail of orexin receptors. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening strategy in combination with co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found interactions between OX1R and the dynein light chains Tctex-type 1 and 3 (Dynlt1, Dynlt3). These interactions were mapped to the C-terminal region of the dynein light chains and to specific residues within the last 10 amino acids of OX1R. Hence, we hypothesized that dynein light chains could regulate orexin signaling. In HEK293 cells expressing OX1R, stimulation with OX-A produced a less sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation when Dynlt1 was co-expressed, while it was prolonged under reduced Dynlt1 expression. The amount of OX1R located at the plasma membrane as well as the kinetics and extent of OX-A-induced internalization of OX1R (disappearance from membrane) were not altered by Dynlt1. However, Dynlt1 reduced the localization of OX1R in early endosomes following initial internalization. Taken together, these data suggest that Dynlt1 modulates orexin signaling by regulating OX1R, namely its intracellular localization following ligand-induced internalization.

The neurotrophic factor neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is involved in many aspects of brain development, from cell fate determination to neuronal maturation. However, nothing is known about the influence of NRG1 on neurodevelopmental processes occurring in the mature hippocampus. Methods: Adult male mice were given subcutaneous NRG1 or saline to assess dentate gyrus proliferation and neurogenesis, as well as cell fate determination. Mice also underwent behavioral testing. Expression of ErbB3 and ErbB4 NRG1 receptors in newborn dentate gyrus cells was assessed at various time points between birth and maturity. The phenotype of ErbB-expressing progenitor cells was also characterized with cell type-specific markers. Results: The current study shows that subchronic peripheral NRG1 beta administration selectively increased cell proliferation (by 71%) and neurogenesis (by 50%) in the caudal dentate gyrus within the ventral hippocampus. This pro-proliferative effect did not alter neuronal fate, and may have been mediated by ErbB3 receptors, which were expressed by newborn dentate gyrus cells from cell division to maturity and colocalized with SOX2 in the subgranular zone. Furthermore, four weeks after cessation of subchronic treatment, animals displayed robust antidepressant-like behavior in the absence of changes in locomotor activity, whereas acute treatment did not produce antidepressant effects. Conclusions: These results show that neuregulin-1 beta has pro-proliferative, neurogenic and antidepressant properties, further highlight the importance of peripheral neurotrophic factors in neurogenesis and mood, and support the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in mediating antidepressant effects.

It is not known why this is. Environmental stimuli associated with drugs can promote the development and persistence of addiction by invigorating and precipitating drug-seeking behaviour. We determined, therefore, whether cues associated with the self-administration of rapidly delivered cocaine (injected intravenously over 5 versus 90 seconds) would acquire greater conditioned rewarding properties, as assessed by the performance of an operant response reinforced solely by the cues. Rats nose-poked for intravenous cocaine infusions delivered either over 5 or 90 seconds. Discrete visual cues accompanied each infusion. The rats could then press a lever to obtain the cues-now a conditioned reward-or an inactive lever. Rats in both the 5- and 90-second groups pressed more on the active versus inactive lever following extensive (24 sessions) but not following limited (3 sessions) self-administration training. There were no group differences in this behaviour. Following withdrawal from cocaine self-administration, lever discrimination progressively abated in both groups and was lost by withdrawal day 30. However, the rewarding properties of the cues were not "forgotten" because on withdrawal days 32-33, amphetamine selectively enhanced active-lever pressing, and did so to a similar extent in both groups. Thus, cues paired with rapid or slower cocaine delivery acquire similar conditioned rewarding properties. We conclude, therefore, that the rapid delivery of cocaine to the brain promotes addiction by mechanisms that might not involve a greater ability of drug cues to control behaviour.

Double Dissociation of Stimulus-Value and Action-Value Learning in Humans with Orbitofrontal or Anterior Cingulate Cortex Damage	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; DECISION-MAKING; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REWARD; BEHAVIOR; NEURONS; CHOICES; REPRESENTATIONS; NEUROBIOLOGY; PREDICTION	Adaptive decision making involves selecting the most valuable option, typically by taking an action. Such choices require value comparisons, but there is debate about whether these comparisons occur at the level of stimuli (goods-based) value, action-based value, or both. One view is that value processes occur in series, with stimulus value informing action value. However, lesion work in nonhuman primates suggests that these two kinds of choice are dissociable. Here, we examined action-value and stimulus-value learning in humans with focal frontal lobe damage. Orbitofrontal damage disrupted the ability to sustain the correct choice of stimulus, but not of action, after positive feedback, while damage centered on dorsal anterior cingulate cortex led to the opposite deficit. These findings argue that there are distinct, domain-specific mechanisms by which outcome value is applied to guide subsequent decisions, depending on whether the choice is between stimuli or between actions.

In vitro and in vivo plasmalogen replacement evaluations in rhizomelic chrondrodysplasia punctata and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease using PPI-1011, an ether lipid plasmalogen precursor	LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE			English	Article						Rhizomelic chrondrodysplasia punctata type 1; Rhizomelic chrondrodysplasia punctata type 2; Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease; Pex7 mouse; lymphocytes; plasmalogen precursor; DHA; peroxisomal disorders; PPI-1011	CHONDRODYSPLASIA PUNCTATA; DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID; PROTEOLIPID PROTEIN; BRAIN; BIOSYNTHESIS; LIPOPROTEINS; DEFICIENCY; TYPE-2	Background: Childhood peroxisomal disorders and leukodystrophies are devastating diseases characterized by dysfunctional lipid metabolism. Plasmalogens (ether glycerophosphoethanolamine lipids) are decreased in these genetic disorders. The biosynthesis of plasmalogens is initiated in peroxisomes but completed in the endoplasmic reticulum. We therefore undertook a study to evaluate the ability of a 3-substituted, 1-alkyl, 2-acyl glyceryl ether lipid (PPI-1011) to replace plasmalogens in rhizomelic chrondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1) and rhizomelic chrondrodysplasia punctata type 2 (RCDP2) lymphocytes which possess peroxisomal mutations culminating in deficient plasmalogen synthesis. We also examined plasmalogen synthesis in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) lymphocytes which possess a proteolipid protein-1 (PLP1) missense mutation that results in abnormal PLP1 folding and it's accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the cellular site of the last steps in plasmalogen synthesis. In vivo incorporation of plasmalogen precursor into tissue plasmalogens was also evaluated in the Pex7 mouse model of plasmalogen deficiency. Results: In both RCDP1 and RCDP2 lymphocytes, PPI-1011 repleted the target ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn16: 0/22:6) in a concentration dependent manner. In addition, deacylation/reacylation reactions resulted in repletion of PlsEtn 16:0/20:4 in both RCDP1 and RCDP2 lymphocytes, repletion of PlsEtn 16:0/18:1 and PlsEtn 16:0/18: 2 in RCDP2 lymphocytes, and partial repletion of PlsEtn 16: 0/18: 1 and PlsEtn 16: 0/18: 2 in RCDP1 lymphocytes. In the Pex7 mouse, oral dosing of labeled PPI-1011 demonstrated repletion of tissue levels of the target plasmalogen PlsEtn 16: 0/22: 6 with phospholipid remodeling also resulting in significant repletion of PlsEtn 16: 0/20: 4 and PlsEtn 16:0/18:1. Metabolic conversion of PPI-1011 to the target plasmalogen was most active in the liver. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that PPI-1011 is activated (removal of 3-substitution) and converted to PlsEtn in vitro in both RCDP1 and RCDP2 lymphocytes and in vivo in the Pex7 mouse model of RCPD1 effectively bypassing the peroxisomal dysfunction present in these disorders. While PPI-1011 was shown to replete PlsEtns 16:0/x, ether lipid precursors of PlsEtn 18: 0/x and PlsEtn 18:1/x may also be needed to achieve optimal clinical benefits of plasmalogen replacement in these complex patient populations. In contrast, only limited plasmalogen replacement was observed in PMD lymphocytes suggesting that the effects of protein misfolding and accumulation in the ER negatively affect processing of plasmalogen precursors in this cellular compartment.

However, the sources and involvement of cytokines such as IL-15 in activating these cells is still unresolved. To investigate the role of IL-15 in enhancing the activation of CD8 T cells in the context of MS, we determined cell types expressing the bioactive surface IL-15 in the peripheral blood of patients and evaluated the impact of this cytokine on CD8 T cell cytotoxicity and migration. Flow cytometric analysis showed a significantly greater proportion of B cells and monocytes from MS patients expressing IL-15 relative to controls. We established that CD40L activation of B cells from healthy donors increased their IL-15 levels, reaching those of MS patients. We also demonstrated an enhanced cytotoxic profile in CD8 T cells from MS patients upon stimulation with IL-15. Furthermore, we showed that IL-15 expressed by B cells and monocytes is sufficient and functional, enhancing granzyme B production by CD8 T cells upon coculture. Exposure of CD8 T cells to this cytokine enhanced their ability to kill glial cells as well as to migrate across an in vitro inflamed human blood-brain barrier. The elevated levels of IL-15 in patients relative to controls, the greater susceptibility of CD8 T cells from patients to IL-15, in addition to the enhanced cytotoxic responses by IL-15-exposed CD8 T cells, stresses the potential of therapeutic strategies to reduce peripheral sources of IL-15 in MS.

Since its first description, many variants of this technique have been described, with varying values for specific parameters such as electrode type and spacing, voltage, pulse duration and plasmid DNA concentration. Here we examine the influence of some of these variables and derive a detailed and optimal protocol for electroporating the caudal neural tube during the third day of embryonic development. Our findings highlight the importance of electrode placement and DNA dilution buffer for optimal expression and absence of electroporation artifacts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Diffusion tensor imaging and cognitive speed in children with multiple sclerosis	JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Pediatric; Demyelination; Multiple sclerosis; Diffusion tensor imaging; Cognition	WHITE-MATTER; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; BRAIN; IMPAIRMENT; CHILDHOOD; MRI; REGISTRATION; DISABILITY; ROBUST	Objectives: To compare white matter (WM) integrity in children with MS and healthy children using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and correlate DTI findings with disease activity, lesion burden, and cognitive processing speed. Methods: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were measured in four corpus callosum (CC), eight hemispheric regions, and the normal-appearing thalamus of 33 children and adolescents with MS and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Images were acquired on a GE LX 1.51 scanner. DTI parameters used were 25 directions, b = 1000 s/mm(2), and 5 mm slice thickness. MS patients had T2 lesion volumes and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were measured; all participants underwent two speeded cognitive tasks (Visual Matching and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)). Results: MS participants displayed lower FA values in the genu (p<0.005), splenium (p<0.001) and in NAWM of bilateral parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes (p<0.001) versus controls. FA and MD in the thalamus did not differ between groups. Higher lesion volumes correlated with reduced FA in CC and hemispheric NAWM. DTI metrics did not correlate with EDSS. FA values in CC regions correlated with Visual Matching (p<0.001) and SDMT (p<0.005) in MS participants only. Interpretation: DTI analyses indicate widespread NAWM disruption in children with MS-with the degree of abnormality correlating with impaired cognitive processing speed. These findings support an early onset tissue pathology in MS and illustrate its functional consequence. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Bethune, A.; Tipu, V.; Sled, J.

GATA4 and GATA6 are associated with outflow tract and septal defects in human. The heart expresses 3 GATA factors, GATA4, 5 and 6 in a partially overlapping pattern. Here, we report that compound Gata4/Gata5 and Gata5/Gata6 mutants die embryonically or perinatally due to severe congenital heart defects. Almost all Gata4(+/-)Gata5(+/-) mutant embryos have double outlet right ventricles (DORV), large ventricular septal defects (VSD) as well as hypertrophied mitral and tricuspid valves. Only 25% of double compound Gata4/Gata5 heterozygotes survive to adulthood and these mice have aortic stenosis. Compound loss of a Gata5 and a Gata6 allele also leads to DORVs associated with subaortic VSDs. Expression of several transcription factors important for endocardial and myocardial cell differentiation, such as Tbx20, Mef2c, Hey1 and Hand2, was reduced in compound heterozygote embryos. These findings suggest the existence of important genetic interactions between Gata5 and the 2 other cardiac GATA factors in endocardial cushion formation and outflow tract morphogenesis. The data identify GATA5 as a potential genetic modifier of congenital heart disease and provide insight for elucidating the genetic basis of an important class of human birth defects.

Human studies investigating stress-induced changes in dopamine levels, however, have focused solely on striatal dopamine transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate in vivo dopamine release in the human prefrontal cortex in response to a psychosocial stress challenge, using the highly selective dopamine D-2/3 PET radioligand [F-18]fallypride in healthy subjects. Twelve healthy subjects (age (y): 39.8; SD = 15.8) underwent a single dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning session after intravenous administration of 185.2 (SD = 10.2) MBq [F-18]fallypride. Psychosocial stress was initiated at 100 min postinjection. PET data were analyzed using the linearized simplified reference region model (LSRRM), which accounts for time-dependent changes in [F-18]fallypride displacement. Voxel-based statistical maps, representing specific D-2/3 binding changes, were computed to localize areas with increased ligand displacement after task initiation, reflecting dopamine release. The psychosocial stress challenge induced detectable amounts of dopamine release throughout the prefrontal cortex, with dopaminergic activity in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex being associated with subjectively rated experiences of psychosocial stress. The novel finding that a mild psychosocial stress in humans induces increased levels of endogenous dopamine in the PFC indicates that the dynamics of the dopamine-related stress response cannot be interpreted by focusing on mesolimbic brain regions alone.

DOUBLE-BLIND, VEHICLE-CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED TWELVE-MONTH NEURODEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY STUDY OF COMMON ALUMINUM SALTS IN THE RAT	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aluminum; Morris watermaze; development; toxicity	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DRINKING-WATER; ORAL ALUMINUM; DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY; OLD RATS; CITRATE; BRAIN; EXPOSURE; BIOAVAILABILITY; RISK	This good laboratory practice (GLP) study of aluminum salts in Sprague-Dawley rats was conducted according to double-blind, vehicle-controlled randomized design by exposing offspring to aluminum citrate in-utero, through lactation, and then in drinking water post-weaning. Three dose levels were used: 30, 100, 300 mg Al/kg bw/day, in addition to control groups that received either water or a sodium citrate solution (27.2 g/L). Endpoints were assessed in both female and male pups: behavioral (motor activity, T-maze, auditory startle, the Functional Observational Battery (FOB) with domains targeting autonomic function, activity, neuromuscular function, sensimotor function, and physiological function), cognitive function (Morris swim maze), brain weight, clinical chemistry, hematology, tissue/blood levels of aluminum and neuropathology. The most notable treatment-related effect observed in the offspring was renal pathology, most prominently in the male pups. Higher mortality and significant morbidity were observed in the male pups in the high Al-citrate dose group; leading to euthanization of this group at day 89. There was evidence for dose-response relationships between neuromuscular measurements hind-limb and fore-limb grip strength and Al-treatment in both males and females, although some of the effects may be secondary to body weight changes. No consistent treatment-related effects were observed in ambulatory counts (motor activity) in the different cohorts. No significant effects were observed for the auditory startle response, T-maze tests (pre-weaning day 23 cohort) or the Morris water maze test (day 120 cohort). None of the lesions seen on histopathological examination of brain tissues of the day 364 group was reported as treatment-related and, as these were also seen in the control group, were likely due to aging. In conclusion, these results indicate that concentrations of aluminum in the drinking water that are required to produce minimally detectable neurobiological effects in the rat are about 10,000 times higher than what is typically found in potable drinking water.

It is hoped that multimodal integration will address these limitations by using the complementary features of already available data. However, purely statistical integration can prove problematic owing to the disparate signal sources. As an alternative, we propose here an advanced neural population model implemented on an anatomically sound cortical mesh with freely adjustable connectivity, which features proper signal expression through a realistic head model for the electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as a haemodynamic model for functional magnetic resonance imaging based on blood oxygen level dependent contrast (fMRI BOLD). It hence allows simultaneous and realistic predictions of EEG and fMRI BOLD from the same underlying model of neural activity. As proof of principle, we investigate here the influence on simulated brain activity of strengthening visual connectivity. In the future we plan to fit multimodal data with this neural population model. This promises novel, model-based insights into the brain's activity in sleep, rest and task conditions.

Voltage-Gated Na+ Channel beta 1B: A Secreted Cell Adhesion Molecule Involved in Human Epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FEBRILE SEIZURES PLUS; SUBUNIT-MEDIATED MODULATION; SODIUM-CHANNEL; GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; RAT-BRAIN; MESSENGER-RNA; MUTATIONS; ANKYRIN	Scn1b-null mice have a severe neurological and cardiac phenotype. Human mutations in SCN1B result in epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia. SCN1B is expressed as two developmentally regulated splice variants, beta 1 and beta 1B, that are each expressed in brain and heart in rodents and humans. Here, we studied the structure and function of beta 1B and investigated a novel human SCN1B epilepsy-related mutation (p.G257R) unique to beta 1B. We show that wild-type beta 1B is not a transmembrane protein, but a soluble protein expressed predominantly during embryonic development that promotes neurite outgrowth. Association of beta 1B with voltage-gated Na+ channels Na(v)1.1 or Na(v)1.3 is not detectable by immunoprecipitation and beta 1B does not affect Na(v)1.3 cell surface expression as measured by [H-3] saxitoxin binding. However, beta 1B coexpression results in subtle alteration of Na(v)1.3 currents in transfected cells, suggesting that beta 1B may modulate Na+ current in brain. Similar to the previously characterized p.R125C mutation, p.G257R results in intracellular retention of beta 1B, generating a functional null allele. In contrast, two other SCN1B mutations associated with epilepsy, p.C121W and p.R85H, are expressed at the cell surface. We propose that beta 1B p.G257R may contribute to epilepsy through a mechanism that includes intracellular retention resulting in aberrant neuronal pathfinding.

Hypertonicity Sensing in Organum Vasculosum Lamina Terminalis Neurons: A Mechanical Process Involving TRPV1 But Not TRPV4	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NORMAL THIRST RESPONSES; MICE LACKING; WATER-INTAKE; RECEPTOR; CHANNEL; RAT; VASOPRESSIN; PATHWAYS; PRESSURE; OSMOSENSATION	Primary osmosensory neurons in the mouse organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) transduce hypertonicity via the activation of nonselective cation channels that cause membrane depolarization and increased action potential discharge, and this effect is absent in mice lacking expression of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (Trpv1) gene (Ciura and Bourque, 2006). However other experiments have indicated that channels encoded by Trpv4 also contribute to central osmosensation in mice (Liedtke and Friedman, 2003; Mizuno et al., 2003). At present, the mechanism by which hypertonicity modulates cation channels in OVLT neurons is unknown, and it remains unclear whether Trpv1 and Trpv4 both contribute to this process. Here, we show that physical shrinking is necessary and sufficient to mediate hypertonicity sensing in OVLT neurons isolated from adult mice. Steps coupling progressive decreases in cell volume to increased neuronal activity were quantitatively equivalent whether shrinking was evoked by osmotic pressure or mechanical aspiration. Finally, modulation of OVLT neurons by tonicity or mechanical stimulation was unaffected by deletion of trpv4 but was abolished in cells lacking Trpv1 or wild-type neurons treated with the TRPV1 antagonist SB366791. Thus, hypertonicity sensing is a mechanical process requiring Trpv1, but not Trpv4.

Fragile X Related Protein 1 Clusters with Ribosomes and Messenger RNAs at a Subset of Dendritic Spines in the Mouse Hippocampus	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MENTAL-RETARDATION PROTEIN; ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT TRAFFICKING; MAMMALIAN STRESS GRANULES; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; BINDING PROTEINS; NEURONS; FXR1; FMRP; TRANSLATION; LOCALIZATION	The formation and storage of memories in neuronal networks relies on new protein synthesis, which can occur locally at synapses using translational machinery present in dendrites and at spines. These new proteins support long-lasting changes in synapse strength and size in response to high levels of synaptic activity. To ensure that proteins are made at the appropriate time and location to enable these synaptic changes, messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is tightly controlled by dendritic RNA-binding proteins. Fragile X Related Protein 1 (FXR1P) is an RNA-binding protein with high homology to Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) and is known to repress and activate mRNA translation in non-neuronal cells. However, unlike FMRP, very little is known about the role of FXR1P in the central nervous system. To understand if FXR1P is positioned to regulate local mRNA translation in dendrites and at synapses, we investigated the expression and targeting of FXR1P in developing hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro. We found that FXR1P was highly expressed during hippocampal development and co-localized with ribosomes and mRNAs in the dendrite and at a subset of spines in mouse hippocampal neurons. Our data indicate that FXR1P is properly positioned to control local protein synthesis in the dendrite and at synapses in the central nervous system.

J	Hughes, BG; Hekimi, S				Hughes, Bryan G.; Hekimi, Siegfried			A Mild Impairment of Mitochondrial Electron Transport Has Sex-Specific Effects on Lifespan and Aging in Mice	PLOS ONE			English	Article							C-OXIDASE DEFICIENCY; MN SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; SYSTEMATIC RNAI SCREEN; LIVED MCLK1(+/-) MICE; OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; RESPIRATORY-CHAIN; BRAIN MITOCHONDRIA; METABOLIC-RATE; COMPLEX-III	Impairments of various aspects of mitochondrial function have been associated with increased lifespan in various model organisms ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to mice. For example, disruption of the function of the 'Rieske' iron-sulfur protein (RISP) of complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain can result in increased lifespan in the nematode worm C. elegans. However, the mechanisms by which impaired mitochondrial function affects aging remain under investigation, including whether or not they require decreased electron transport. We have generated knock-in mice with a loss-of-function Risp mutation that is homozygous lethal. However, heterozygotes (Risp(+/P224S)) were viable and had decreased levels of RISP protein and complex III enzymatic activity. This decrease was sufficient to impair mitochondrial respiration and to decrease overall metabolic rate in males, but not females. These defects did not appear to exert an overtly deleterious effect on the health of the mutants, since young Risp(+/P224S) mice are outwardly normal, with unaffected performance and fertility. Furthermore, biomarkers of oxidative stress were unaffected in both young and aged animals. Despite this, the average lifespan of male Risp(+/P224S) mice was shortened and aged Risp(+/P224S) males showed signs of more rapidly deteriorating health. In spite of these differences, analysis of Gompertz mortality parameters showed that Risp heterozygosity decreased the rate of increase of mortality with age and increased the intrinsic vulnerability to death in both sexes. However, the intrinsic vulnerability was increased more dramatically in males, which resulted in their shortened lifespan. For females, the slower acceleration of age-dependent mortality results in significantly increased survival of Risp(+/P224S) mice in the second half of lifespan. These results demonstrate that even relatively small perturbations of the mitochondrial electron transport chain can have significant physiological effects in mammals, and that the severity of those effects can be sex-dependent.

However, comparability of individual data cannot be taken for granted when information from different studies has to be summarized. By means of statistical standardization approaches the comparability of data might be increased. An analysis of individual data on the neurobehavioral impact of manganese (Mn) exemplifies challenges and effects of a multilevel statistical procedure. Confounding from individual-level and study-level covariates was shown by analyses of variance, but could be reduced by linear regressions and z-normalization using data of the respective control groups. Fixed models that were used to estimate the impact of the neurotoxic exposure, provided evidence that the employed procedures, especially the z-normalization, effectively reduced variance that was unrelated to the neurotoxic exposure. Even after this statistical treatment the fixed effect models revealed differences among studies that did not seem to be exhaustively explicable by concentration differences obvious from the Mn biomarker at hand. IPD studies using confounded endpoints as effects markers can be reasonably summarized when appropriate statistical operations are employed. For the data at hand the proposed normalization allowed new insights into exposure-effect relationships, in general it appears appropriate to investigate the effect of the independent variable more closely.

In rodents, social exploration and play behavior increase during the juvenile period, suggesting that this timeframe represents an important window for socialization. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms necessary to support this developmental process have not been elucidated. Neurogenesis during the juvenile period, like that in adults, is mainly confined to the subgranular and subventricular zones. Nevertheless, the levels of neurogenesis are significantly higher during the juvenile period, suggesting unique functions not shared with adult neurogenesis. Here we use a transgenic mouse approach that allows for ablation of neurogenesis during different developmental phases. We find that ablating neurogenesis during either juvenile or adult phases altered anxiety and memory in adult female mice, demonstrating an age-independent function of new neurons for certain behaviors. Blocking neurogenesis during the juvenile period resulted in a profound impairment in the ability of these mice to interact with other adult females or to retrieve pups, without causing gross olfactory deficits. Interestingly, ablating neurogenesis in adult females had no effect on these social behaviors. This work defines a novel role for juvenile neurogenesis in establishing brain circuits necessary for socialization, and demonstrates that juvenile and adult neurogenesis make different contributions to social competency in adult female mice. Additional work is needed to determine whether ablation of juvenile neurogenesis in the subgranular zone and/or the subventricular zone is responsible for the social abnormalities seen after global elimination of juvenile neurogenesis.

Canadian Critical Care Trials Grp	Mortality associated with withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy for patients with severe traumatic brain injury: a Canadian multicentre cohort study	CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Article							INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; PROGNOSTIC MODELS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; SUPPORT; IMPACT; RATES	Background: Severe traumatic brain injury often leads to death from withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, although prognosis is difficult to determine. Methods: To evaluate variation in mortality following the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and hospital mortality in patients with critical illness and severe traumatic brain injury, we conducted a two-year multicentre retrospective cohort study in six Canadian level-one trauma centres. The effect of centre on hospital mortality and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy was evaluated using multi-variable logistic regression adjusted for baseline patient-level covariates (sex, age, pupillary reactivity and score on the Glasgow coma scale). Results: We randomly selected 720 patients with traumatic brain injury for our study. The overall hospital mortality among these patients was 228/720 (31.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 28.4%-35.2%) and ranged from 10.8% to 44.2% across centres (chi(2) test for overall difference, p < 0.001). Most deaths (70.2% [160/228], 95% CI 63.9%-75.7%) were associated with withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, ranging from 45.0% (18/40) to 86.8% (46/53) (chi(2) test for overall difference, p < 0.001) across centres. Adjusted odd ratios (ORs) for the effect of centre on hospital mortality ranged from 0.61 to 1.55 (p < 0.001). The incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy varied by centre, with ORs ranging from 0.42 to 2.40 (p = 0.001). About one half of deaths that occurred following the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies happened within the first three days of care. Interpretation: We observed significant variation in mortality across centres. This may be explained in part by regional variations in physician, family or community approaches to the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Considering the high proportion of early deaths associated with the withdrawal of life sustaining therapy and the limited accuracy of current prognostic indicators, caution should be used regarding early withdrawal of life sustaining therapy following severe traumatic brain injury.

A visual field dependent architecture for second order motion processing	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Cortical hierarchy; Second order; Motion perception; Eccentricity; Motion gradients	CORTICAL MAGNIFICATION FACTOR; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; TEXTURE SEGREGATION; CORTEX; MECHANISMS; NEURONS; MT; PERCEPTION; MONKEYS; MODEL	The visual system exploits a cortical hierarchy to process complex inputs such as those defined by modulations of motion and/or texture. One class of visual stimuli, composed of alternate stripes of opposing motion requires at least 2 separate stages of computation within this cortical hierarchy, thought to involve cortical area V1 and extra-striate regions like global motion area MT respectively. Using a psychophysical task, we characterise sensitivity to such stimuli containing periodic spatial modulations of motion gradients as a function of the ratio of the spatial parameters at the two processing levels by manipulating the spatial properties of the carrier and modulator. We find band-passed functions for foveal stimulus presentations showing an optimum sensitivity at ratios in the range of r <= 10, informative of the coupling relationship between frequency channels at the carrier and modulator levels. An annulus stimulus (excluding the fovea) with a radius of 15.5 degrees exhibited optima of sensitivity at r > 15. This difference in the optimal coupling between filtering stages reflects a processing architecture that changes with eccentricity, consistent with the previously observed smaller differences between mean receptive field sizes in striate and extra-striate filtering stages in the fovea compared to the periphery. This is also important for visual psychophysics when comparing sensitivity for first and second order stimuli across retinal eccentricity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its accessible neural architecture shares similarities with mammalian sensory systems and allows for recordings from successive brain areas to test hypotheses about neural coding. Further, electrosensory stimuli encountered during prey capture, navigation, and communication, can be readily synthesized in the laboratory. These features enable analyses of the neural circuitry that reveal general principles of encoding and decoding, such as segregation of information into separate streams and neural response sparsification. A systems level understanding arises via linkage between cellular differentiation and network architecture, revealed by in vitro and in vivo analyses, while computational modeling reveals how single cell dynamics and connectivity shape the sparsification process.

Case Report: Fluorescein angiography and spectral optical coherence tomography was performed in a 37-year-old woman using a SD-OCT device with axial resolution of 6 mu m. Enzyme assay followed. The patient was diagnosed with type I sialidosis by enzymatic assay. Besides a normal angiogram, a thickened nerve fiber layer was observed on spectral optical coherence tomography. Conclusions: The thickened nerve fiber layer was probably caused by accumulation of metabolic products such as sialylated oligosaccharides and glycopeptides, suggesting that SD-OCT, due to its enhanced resolution, can be a useful tool for diagnosis of rare neurological conditions.

Study Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Tertiary care centre. Patients: Group 1 (57 patients) and group 2 (87 patients) underwent translabyrinthine VS excision with and without systematic ET obliteration, respectively. Main Outcome Measures: Petrous apex pneumatization level and postoperative CSF leak were evaluated. Group 1 patients had a late postoperative otologic examination, tympanometric test, Valsalva manoeuvre, and ear symptom evaluation. Results: There were six cases of CSF rhinorrhea in group 2, whereas no cases were observed in group 1 (p = 5.043), despite its larger tumour grade (p = 5.002). In group 2, CSF rhinorrhea was absent at pneumatization level 1. Three of six CSF rhinorrhea cases developed meningitis. None of the 27 tested patients of group 1 demonstrated a tympanic membrane retraction or a positive Valsalva manoeuvre. Tympanometry showed a type A curve (2 patients), a type As curve (14 patients), and a type B curve (11 patients). Air volumes and air pressures of the operated ears were lower than those of the nonoperated ears (p < .001). Conclusion: Patients of group 1 tolerated the procedure well, with preserved tympanic membrane compliance. Bidirectional air exchange throughout a normal middle ear mucosa explains this fact. We recommend obliteration of both the petrous apex cells and ET in all cases of petrous apex pneumatization levels 2 to 4.

NGF plays an important role in ocular surface maintenance and corneal wound healing and was recently shown to have mucin secretagogue activity in conjunctival cells. We investigated whether MIM-D3 increased glycoconjugate secretion in conjunctival cells in vitro and in rat tear fluids in vivo. Primary rat conjunctival cell cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of MIM-D3 and evaluated for glycoconjugate secretion, proliferation and MAPK1/2 activation. Glycoconjugates were quantitated in tear fluids from normal rats treated topically with increasing doses of MIM-D3 (0.4%, 1% and 2.5%). Dry eye was induced in rats by subcutaneous scopolamine treatment, administered by surgically implanted osmotic pumps for 14 or 28 days. Aqueous tear production, tear clearance, fluorescein corneal staining and tear break-up time (tBUT) were evaluated. Glycoconjugates and NGF were quantitated in the tear fluids by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), respectively. We found that 50 mu M MIM-D3 statistically significantly induced a 1.3-fold increase in glycoconjugate secretion and a 2.3-fold increase in MAPK1/2 activation without increasing proliferation from conjunctival cell cultures. Application of 2.5% MIM-D3 in normal rat eyes statistically significantly increased tear glycoconjugate concentration by 2.3-fold. In the experimental dry eye model, application of 1% MIM-D3 to rat eyes for either 1 or 17 consecutive days, followed by 1 week of no dosing produced a statistically significant decrease in corneal staining (p < 0.001), a slight increase in tBUT, and increases in tear glycoconjugates (p < 0.05) compared to vehicle. Scopolamine treatment also caused a statistically significant increase of endogenous NGF in tears (p < 0.005). We concluded that the increase in glycoconjugate concentration by the 1% MIM-D3 dose may have improved the quality and stability of the tear film, and thereby improved healing on the ocular surface in dry eye. Therefore, MIM-D3 may have therapeutic potential as a topical agent for the treatment of dry eye. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their presence affects the molecular properties and structure of glycoconjugates, modifying their function and interactions with other molecules. Consequently, the sialylation state of glycoproteins and glycolipids has been recognized as a critical factor modulating molecular recognitions inside the cell, between the cells, between the cells and the extracellular matrix, and between the cells and certain exogenous pathogens. Sialyltransferases that attach sialic acid residues to the glycan chains in the process of their initial synthesis were thought to be mainly responsible for the creation and maintenance of a temporal and spatial diversity of sialylated moieties. However, the growing evidence also suggests that in mammalian cells, at least equally important roles belong to sialidases/neuraminidases, which are located on the cell surface and in intracellular compartments, and may either initiate the catabolism of sialoglycoconjugates or just cleave their sialic acid residues, and thereby contribute to temporal changes in their structure and functions. The current review summarizes emerging data demonstrating that neuraminidase 1 (NEU1), well known for its lysosomal catabolic function, can be also targeted to the cell surface and assume the previously unrecognized role as a structural and functional modulator of cellular receptors.

Of the different imaging modalities, two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) is becoming an important tool for cellular-resolution measurements of NADH changes associated with cellular metabolic changes. However, NADH fluorescence emission is strongly absorbed by hemoglobin. As a result, in vivo measurements are significantly affected by the hemodynamics associated with physiological and pathophysiological manipulations. We model NADH fluorescence excitation and emission in TPLSM imaging based on precise maps of cerebral microvasculature. The effects of hemoglobin optical absorption and optical scattering from red blood cells, changes in blood volume and hemoglobin oxygen saturation, vessel size, and location with respect to imaging location are explored. A simple technique for correcting the measured NADH fluorescence intensity changes is provided, with the utilization of a parallel measurement of a physiologically inert fluorophore. The model is applied to TPLSM measurements of NADH fluorescence intensity changes in rat somatosensory cortex during mild hypoxia and hyperoxia. The general approach of the correction algorithm can be extended to other TPLSM measurements, where changes in the optical properties of the tissue confound physiological measurements, such as the detection of calcium dynamics.

We find that both the continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion (c-WWI) and the standard, stroboscopic Wagon Wheel Illusion (WWI) can be explained by a recurrent model in which the cortex provides both excitatory and inhibitory feedback to a weakly tuned input from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Comparison of data from recent psychophysics experiments with theoretical predictions derived from the network dynamics leads to excellent agreement. Conversely, this agreement confirms the validity of the model and highlights the fact that the Wagon Wheel Illusion can serve as a useful probe of the human striate cortex. We find that the WWI results from phase-locking in the visual system and that a circle map determines the dynamics of the illusion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the c-WWI is a consequence of continuous processing and cannot be used to support claims of discrete processing by the visual system.

In vivo conditions influence the coding of stimulus features by bursts of action potentials	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Weakly electric fish; Burst; Neural coding; Model	WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; ELECTROSENSORY NEURONS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; NEURAL INFORMATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SENSORY NEURONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; LINE LOBE	The functional role of burst firing (i.e. the firing of packets of action potentials followed by quiescence) in sensory processing is still under debate. Should bursts be considered as unitary events that signal the presence of a particular feature in the sensory environment or is information about stimulus attributes contained within their temporal structure? We compared the coding of stimulus attributes by bursts in vivo and in vitro of electrosensory pyramidal neurons in weakly electric fish by computing correlations between burst and stimulus attributes. Our results show that, while these correlations were strong in magnitude and significant in vitro, they were actually much weaker in magnitude if at all significant in vivo. We used a mathematical model of pyramidal neuron activity in vivo and showed that such a model could reproduce the correlations seen in vitro, thereby suggesting that differences in burst coding were not due to differences in bursting seen in vivo and in vitro. We next tested whether variability in the baseline (i.e. without stimulation) activity of ELL pyramidal neurons could account for these differences. To do so, we injected noise into our model whose intensity was calibrated to mimic baseline activity variability as quantified by the coefficient of variation. We found that this noise caused significant decreases in the magnitude of correlations between burst and stimulus attributes and could account for differences between in vitro and in vivo conditions. We then tested this prediction experimentally by directly injecting noise in vitro through the recording electrode. Our results show that this caused a lowering in magnitude of the correlations between burst and stimulus attributes in vitro and gave rise to values that were quantitatively similar to those seen under in vivo conditions. While it is expected that noise in the form of baseline activity variability will lower correlations between burst and stimulus attributes, our results show that such variability can account for differences seen in vivo. Thus, the high variability seen under in vivo conditions has profound consequences on the coding of information by bursts in ELL pyramidal neurons. In particular, our results support the viewpoint that bursts serve as a detector of particular stimulus features but do not carry detailed information about such features in their structure.

Psychometric properties of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in French clinical and nonclinical adults	REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			English	Article						Cut-off scores; Confirmatory factor analyses; Ordered-categorical items; WLSMV; CES-D; Depression; Mood disorders; Diagnosis; Convergent validity	CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW MINI; ITEM-RESPONSE BIAS; OF-FIT INDEXES; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; FACTORIAL INVARIANCE; SEX-DIFFERENCES; PSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; AFFECTIVE-DISORDERS; SYMPTOMS	Background. - Previous research on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) has five main limitations. First, no study provided evidence of the factorial equivalence of this instrument across samples of depressive and community participants. Second, only one study included systematic tests of measurement invariance based on confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), and this study did not consider the higher-order factor structure of depression, although it is the CES-D global scale score that is most often used in the context of epidemiological studies. Third, few studies investigated the screening properties of the CES-D in non-English-language samples and their results were inconsistent. Fourth, although the French version of the CES-D has been used in several previous studies, it has never been systematically validated among community and/or depressed adults. Finally, very few studies have taken into account the ordered-categorical nature of the CES-D answer scale. The purpose of the study reported herein was therefore to examine the construct validity (i.e., factorial, reliability, measurement invariance, latent mean invariance, convergence, and screening properties) of the CES-D in a French sample of depressed patients and community adults. Methods. - A total sample of 469 participants, comprising 163 clinically depressed patients and 306 community adults, was involved in this study. The factorial validity, and the measurement and latent mean invariance of the CES-D across gender and clinical status, were verified through CFAs based on ordered-categorical items. Correlation and receiver operator characteristic curves were also used to test the convergent validity and screening properties of the CES-D. Results. - The present results: (i) provided support for the factor validity and reliability of a second-order measurement model of depression based on responses to the CES-D items; (ii) revealed the full measurement invariance of the first- and second-order measurement models across gender; (iii) showed the partial strict measurement invariance (four uniquenesses had to be freely estimated, but the factor variance-covariance matrix also proved fully invariant) of the first-order factor model and the complete measurement invariance of the second-order model across patients and community adults; (iv) revealed a lack of latent mean invariance across gender and across clinical and community subsamples (with women and patients reporting higher scores on all subscales and on the full scale); (v) confirmed the convergent validity of the CES-D with measures of depression, self-esteem, anxiety, and hopelessness; and (vi) demonstrated the efficacy of the screening properties of this instrument among clinical and nonclinical adults. Conclusion. - This instrument may be useful for assessing depressive symptoms or for the screening of depressive disorders in the context of epidemiological studies targeting French patients and community men and women with a background similar to those from the present study.

In the present study we investigated the effects of sports concussion on white matter using three different diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial diffusivity (AD). We compared a group of 10 non-concussed athletes with a group of 18 concussed athletes of the same age (mean age 22.5 years) and education (mean 16 years) using a voxel-based approach (VBA) in both the acute and chronic post-injury phases. All concussed athletes were scanned 1-6 days post-concussion and again 6 months later in a 3T Siemens Trio (TM) MRI. Three 2 x 2 repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted, one for each measure of DTI used in the current study. There was a main group effect of FA, which was increased in dorsal regions of both corticospinal tracts (CST) and in the corpus callosum in concussed athletes at both time points. There was a main group effect of AD in the right CST, where concussed athletes showed elevated values relative to controls at both time points. MD values were decreased in concussed athletes, in whom analyses revealed significant group differences in the CST and corpus callosum at both time points. Although the use of VBA does limit the analyses to large tracts, and it has clinical limitations with regard to individual analyses, our results nevertheless indicate that sports concussions do result in changes in diffusivity in the corpus callosum and CST that are not detected using conventional neuroimaging techniques.

The onset of cancer can be postponed by pharmacological and dietary anti-aging interventions. We recently found in yeast cellular models of aging that lithocholic acid (LCA) extends longevity. Here we show that, at concentrations that are not cytotoxic to primary cultures of human neurons, LCA kills the neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines BE(2)-m17, SK-n-SH, SK-n-MCIXC and Lan-1. In BE(2)-m17, SK-n-SH and SK-n-MCIXC cells, the LCA anti-tumor effect is due to apoptotic cell death. In contrast, the LCA-triggered death of Lan-1 cells is not caused by apoptosis. While low concentrations of LCA sensitize BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cells to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptotic cell death controlled by mitochondria, these LCA concentrations make primary cultures of human neurons resistant to such a form of cell death. LCA kills BE(2)-m17 and SK-n-MCIXC cell lines by triggering not only the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic cell death pathway driven by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and initiator caspase-9 activation, but also the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway of apoptosis involving activation of the initiator caspase-8. Based on these data, we propose a mechanism underlying a potent and selective anti-tumor effect of LCA in cultured human NB cells. Moreover, our finding that LCA kills cultured human breast cancer and rat glioma cells implies that it has a broad anti-tumor effect on cancer cells derived from different tissues and organisms.

For fMRI data sets, spatial dimension being much greater than temporal dimension, spatial ICA is the computationally tractable approach generally proposed. However, for some neuroscientific applications, temporal independence of source signals can be assumed and temporal ICA becomes then an attractive exploratory technique. In this work, we use a classical linear algebra result ensuring the tractability of temporal ICA. We report several experiments on synthetic data and real MRI data sets that demonstrate the potential interest of our R package.

Methods: This multicenter randomized 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 612 subjects with a diagnosis of SPMS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3.5-6.5, stratified according to baseline EDSS score (3.5-5.0, or 5.5-6.5) and HLA haplotype (DR2(+) or DR4(+), or DR2(-)/DR4(-)). Upon entry of 100 DR2(-)/DR4(-) subjects, further study enrollment was limited to DR2(+) or DR4(+) subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned to either 500 mg MBP8298 or placebo, given by IV injection once every 6 months for 2 years. The primary outcome measure was time to progression by >= 1.0 EDSS point (or 0.5 point if baseline EDSS was 5.5 or higher), confirmed 6 months later. Secondary outcomes included mean change in EDSS, mean change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, MRI changes, annualized relapse rate, and quality of life. Results: There were no significant differences between treatment groups in either the primary or secondary endpoints. MBP8298 was well tolerated in all treated subjects with no safety issues identified. Conclusion: In the population studied, treatment with MBP8298 did not provide a clinical benefit compared to placebo. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class 1 evidence that MBP8298 is not effective in patients with SPMS who are HLA DR2(+) or DR4(+). Neurology (R) 2011;77:1551-1560	[Freedman, M.

Evidence Report: Genetic and metabolic testing on children with global developmental delay Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							COMPARATIVE GENOMIC HYBRIDIZATION; IDIOPATHIC MENTAL-RETARDATION; ARRAY-CGH; DYSMORPHIC FEATURES; CHROMOSOMAL-ABNORMALITIES; MICROARRAY ANALYSIS; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; CLINICAL GENETICS; HR-CGH; IMBALANCES	Objective: To systematically review the evidence concerning the diagnostic yield of genetic and metabolic evaluation of children with global developmental delay or intellectual disability (GDD/ID). Methods: Relevant literature was reviewed, abstracted, and classified according to the 4-tiered American Academy of Neurology classification of evidence scheme. Results and Conclusions: In patients with GDD/ID, microarray testing is diagnostic on average in 7.8% (Class III), G-banded karyotyping is abnormal in at least 4% (Class II and III), and subtelomeric fluorescence in situ hybridization is positive in 3.5% (Class I, II, and III). Testing for X-linked ID genes has a yield of up to 42% in males with an appropriate family history (Class III). FMR1 testing shows full expansion in at least2% of patients with mild to moderate GDD/ID (Class II and III), and MeCP2 testing is diagnostic in 1.5% of females with moderate to severe GDD/ID (Class III). Tests for metabolic disorders have a yield of up to 5%, and tests for congenital disorders of glycosylation and cerebral creatine disorders have yields of up to 2.8% (Class III). Several genetic and metabolic screening tests have been shown to have a better than 1% diagnostic yield in selected populations of children with GDD/ ID. These values should be among the many factors considered in planning the laboratory evaluation of such children. Neurology (R) 2011;77:1629-1635	[Michelson, D.

Prospective study on neurotoxic effects in manganese-exposed bridge construction welders	NEUROTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Follow-up study; Welders; Manganese; Neurological; Neuropsychological	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DANISH STEEL WORKERS; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; NEUROMOTOR FUNCTION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; DIOXIDE; COHORT; SPACE	Background: In a group of 43 confined space welders dose-effect relationships had been identified for adverse neurological/neuropsychological functional effects in relation to manganese (Mn) in blood or air (cumulative exposure index). The welders' exposure to Mn was unprotected and with poor ventilation, lasting on average 16.5 months. A follow-up examination 3.5 years later, after cessation of confined space welding, was carried out to re-assess the status of mood, movement/neuromotor and cognitive functions, and olfaction. Methods: In 2008, 26 welders (70% response rate) were retested using a similar methodology as at baseline (Bowler et al., 2007). A general linear model was used to estimate individual-specific endpoint differences over time. Mean age was 47 years, mean years of education 12.4, and mean total years of welding 16.9 years. Thirteen participants no longer welded. Results: At follow-up, mean blood Mn concentration had decreased from 10.0 to 8.4 mu g/L (p = 0.002). Those still welding had higher blood Mn than those no longer welding (9.9 mu g/L vs. 6.8 mu g/L, p = 0.002). Several domains of cognitive functioning improved substantially as shown by large effect sizes. Emotional disturbance improved only slightly clinically, but complaints of depression and anxiety persisted. Motor dexterity/tactile function and graphomotor tremor improved significantly, while psychomotor speed remained unchanged. The findings of the neurological examination (UPDRS) did not change compared to baseline, whereas rigidity, dominant postural hand tremor and body sway worsened. Olfactory test scores remained depressed. Conclusion: After 3.5 years of cessation of confined space welding, only cognitive function improved significantly, while olfactory, extrapyramidal, and mood disturbances remained constant or were exacerbated. This suggests differential intrinsic vulnerabilities of the brain loci involved with Mn exposure. As the Mn exposure of the Bay Bridge welders frequently exceeded the Cal-OSHA TLV of 0.2 mg Mn/m(3) at baseline, a more stringent preventive measure is recommended for confined space welding.

The first NN identifier uses the output signals from the actual system for the system identification. The on-line update laws for dynamic neural networks have been developed using the Lyapunov function and singularly perturbed techniques. In the second NN identifier, all the output signals from nonlinear system are replaced with the state variables of the neuron networks. The on-line identification algorithm with dead-zone function is proposed to improve nonlinear system identification performance. Compared with other dynamic neural network identification methods, the proposed identification methods exhibit improved identification performance. Three examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Fifteen dementia and geriatric clinics across Canada. Participants: Community-living patients with AD (n = 370) with Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores greater than 10. Measurements: Patients rated their QOL by using two utility indexes, the European QOL-5 Dimensions and the Quality of Well-Being Scale, a global QOL Visual Analog Scale, and the disease-specific QOL-AD instrument. Cognition was assessed with the AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale and MMSE, function with the Disability Assessment for Dementia, and behavioral and psychological symptoms with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). One-way analysis of variance and fully adjusted multiple linear regression were used to assess the relationship between core dementia symptoms and QOL ratings. Results: The QOL measures had only small-to-moderate correlations with each other. For all QOL measures, patient ratings were significantly lower among patients with more depressive symptoms. In multivariable analyses, the GDS score was the only significant independent predictor of patient self-ratings for all four QOL measures. Conclusions: Self-rated symptoms of depression were a consistent independent predictor of patient-rated QOL across diverse QOL measures, while performance-based measures of cognition and informant-based functional status were not. These findings confirm the importance of identifying and treating depression in patients with AD and endorse the use of measures of self-rated depressive symptoms and QOL as outcomes in AD clinical trials.

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Fifteen dementia and geriatric clinics across Canada. Participants: Family caregivers (n = 412) of community-living patients with AD of all severities. Measurements: Caregiver ratings of patient QOL using three utility indexes, the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, Quality of Well-Being Scale and Health Utilities Index; a global QOL visual analogue scale; a disease-specific measure, the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease; and a generic health status measure, the Short Form-36. Patient cognition was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination, function with the Disability Assessment for Dementia, and behavioral and psychological symptoms with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Caregiver burden was assessed with the Zarit Burden Interview and caregiver depression with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. One-way analysis of variance and fully adjusted multiple linear regression were used to assess the relationship between patient dementia symptom and caregiver variables with QOL ratings. Results: In multivariable analyses, caregiver ratings of patient function and depressive symptoms were the only consistent independent predictors of caregiver-rated QOL across the QOL measures. Conclusions: Caregiver ratings of patient function and depression were consistent independent predictors of caregiver-rated QOL, using a spectrum of QOL measures, while measures of patient cognition and caregiver burden and depression were not. These findings support the continued use of caregiver ratings as an important source of information about patient QOL and endorse the inclusion in AD clinical trials of caregiver-rated measures of patient function, depression, and QOL.

INTERPHONE Study Grp	Acoustic neuroma risk in relation to mobile telephone use: Results of the INTERPHONE international case-control study	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Acoustic neuroma; Vestibular schwannoma; Brain tumour; Mobile phones; Radiofrequency electromagnetic fields; Epidemiology	PHONE USE; VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA; BRAIN-TUMORS; CELLULAR TELEPHONES; CORDLESS TELEPHONES; SELECTION BIAS; CANCER-RISK; LOUD NOISE; EXPOSURE; RECALL	Background: The rapid increase in mobile telephone use has generated concern about possible health risks of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from these devices. Methods: A case-control study of 1105 patients with newly diagnosed acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) and 2145 controls was conducted in 13 countries using a common protocol. Past mobile phone use was assessed by personal interview. In the primary analysis, exposure time was censored at one year before the reference date (date of diagnosis for cases and date of diagnosis of the matched case for controls); analyses censoring exposure at five years before the reference date were also done to allow for a possible longer latent period. Results: The odds ratio (OR) of acoustic neuroma with ever having been a regular mobile phone user was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.69-1.04). The OR for >= 10 years after first regular mobile phone use was 0.76 (0.52-1.11). There was no trend of increasing ORs with increasing cumulative call time or cumulative number of calls, with the lowest OR (0.48 (0.30-0.78)) observed in the 9th decile of cumulative call time. In the 10th decile (>= 1640 h) of cumulative call time, the OR was 1.32 (0.88-1.97); there were, however, implausible values of reported use in those with >= 1640 h of accumulated mobile phone use. With censoring at 5 years before the reference date the OR for >= 10 years after first regular mobile phone use was 0.83 (0.58-1.19) and for >= 1640 h of cumulative call time it was 2.79(1.51-5.16). but again with no trend in the lower nine deciles and with the lowest OR in the 9th decile. In general, ORs were not greater in subjects who reported usual phone use on the same side of the head as their tumour than in those who reported it on the opposite side, but it was greater in those in the 10th decile of cumulative hours of use. Conclusions: There was no increase in risk of acoustic neuroma with ever regular use of a mobile phone or for users who began regular use 10 years or more before the reference date. Elevated odds ratios observed at the highest level of cumulative call time could be due to chance, reporting bias or a causal effect. As acoustic neuroma is usually a slowly growing tumour, the interval between introduction of mobile phones and occurrence of the tumour might have been too short to observe an effect, if there is one.

Deeper coma generally displays a burst-suppression pattern characterized by alternating episodes of isoelectric (flat) EEG and bursting slow waves. The latter are the result of cortical hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by intracellular recordings in anesthetized animals. Further deepening of the coma yields to continuous isoelectric EEG and eventually results in a newly discovered type of spiky waves that have been termed m-complexes. They originate in the hippocampus as a result of intrinsically generated oscillations (ripples) in the delta range.

Their taxonomic richness varies considerably among their hosts. Previous studies have already explored some important factors shaping louse diversity. An unexplored potential correlate of louse taxonomic richness is host behavioural flexibility. In this comparative study, we examine the relationship between louse generic richness, innovative capabilities (as a proxy for behavioural flexibility), and brain size while controlling for host species diversity, phylogeny, body size and research effort. Using data for 108 avian families, we found a highly significant positive relationship between host innovative capabilities and the taxonomic richness of amblyceran lice, but a lack of a similar relationship in ischnoceran lice. Host brain size had only a marginal impact on amblyceran diversity and no correlation with ischnoceran diversity. This suggests that the effect in Amblycera is not mediated by metabolic limitations due to the energetic costs of brain size and maintenance, rather directly caused by the ecological differences between hosts with differing cognitive capabilities. We propose four alternative and mutually non-exclusive hypotheses that may explain this phenomenon. (C) 2011 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Contrast sensitivity of MT receptive field centers and surrounds. J Neurophysiol 106: 1888-1900, 2011. First published July 13, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00165.2011.-Neurons throughout the visual system have receptive fields with both excitatory and suppressive components. The latter are responsible for a phenomenon known as surround suppression, in which responses decrease as a stimulus is extended beyond a certain size. Previous work has shown that surround suppression in the primary visual cortex depends strongly on stimulus contrast. Such complex center-surround interactions are thought to relate to a variety of functions, although little is known about how they affect responses in the extrastriate visual cortex. We have therefore examined the interaction of center and surround in the middle temporal (MT) area of the macaque (Macaca mulatta) extrastriate cortex by recording neuronal responses to stimuli of different sizes and contrasts. Our findings indicate that surround suppression in MT is highly contrast dependent, with the strongest suppression emerging unexpectedly at intermediate stimulus contrasts. These results can be explained by a simple model that takes into account the nonlinear contrast sensitivity of the neurons that provide input to MT. The model also provides a qualitative link to previous reports of a topographic organization of area MT based on clusters of neurons with differing surround suppression strength. We show that this organization can be detected in the gamma-band local field potentials (LFPs) and that the model parameters can predict the contrast sensitivity of these LFP responses. Overall our results show that surround suppression in area MT is far more common than previously suspected, highlighting the potential functional importance of the accumulation of nonlinearities along the dorsal visual pathway.

First published July 20, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn. 00116.2011.-Directional selectivity, in which neurons respond strongly to an object moving in a given direction ("preferred") but respond weakly or not at all to an object moving in the opposite direction ("null"), is a critical computation achieved in brain circuits. Previous measures of direction selectivity have compared the numbers of action potentials elicited by each direction of movement, but most sensory neurons display patterning, such as bursting, in their spike trains. To examine the contribution of patterned responses to direction selectivity, we recorded from midbrain neurons in weakly electric fish and found that most neurons responded with a combination of both bursts and isolated spikes to moving object stimuli. In these neurons, we separated bursts and isolated spikes using an interspike interval (ISI) threshold. The directional bias of bursts was significantly higher than that of either the full spike train or the isolated spike train. To examine the encoding and decoding of bursts, we built biologically plausible models that examine 1) the upstream mechanisms that generate these spiking patterns and 2) downstream decoders of bursts. Our model of upstream mechanisms uses an interaction between afferent input and subthreshold calcium channels to give rise to burst firing that occurs preferentially for one direction of movement. We tested this model in vivo by application of calcium antagonists, which reduced burst firing and eliminated the differences in direction selectivity between bursts, isolated spikes, and the full spike train. Our model of downstream decoders used strong synaptic facilitation to achieve qualitatively similar results to those obtained using the ISI threshold criterion. This model shows that direction selective information carried by bursts can be decoded by downstream neurons using biophysically plausible mechanisms.

Recovery of hindlimb locomotion after incomplete spinal cord injury in the cat involves spontaneous compensatory changes within the spinal locomotor circuitry. J Neurophysiol 106:1969-1984, 2011. First published July 20, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00368.2011.-After incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), compensatory changes occur throughout the whole neuraxis, including the spinal cord below the lesion, as suggested by previous experiments using a dual SCI paradigm. Indeed, cats submitted to a lateral spinal hemisection at T10-T11 and trained on a treadmill for 3-14 wk re-expressed bilateral hindlimb locomotion as soon as 24 h after spinalization, a process that normally takes 2-3 wk when a complete spinalization is performed without a prior hemisection. In this study, we wanted to ascertain whether similar effects could occur spontaneously without training between the two SCIs and within a short period of 3 wk in 11 cats. One day after the complete spinalization, 9 of the 11 cats were able to re-express hindlimb locomotion either bilaterally (n = 6) or unilaterally on the side of the previous hemisection (n = 3). In these 9 cats, the hindlimb on the side of the previous hemisection (left hindlimb) performed better than the right side in contrast to that observed during the hemispinal period itself. Cats re-expressing the best bilateral hindlimb locomotion after spinalization had the largest initial hemilesion and the most prominent locomotor deficits after this first SCI. These results provide evidence that 1) marked reorganization of the spinal locomotor circuitry can occur without specific locomotor training and within a short period of 3 wk; 2) the spinal cord can reorganize in a more or less symmetrical way; and 3) the ability to walk after spinalization depends on the degree of deficits and adaptation observed in the hemispinal period.

This study examined the antecedents and correlates of presenteeism, absenteeism, and productivity loss attributed to presenteeism. Predictors included work context, personal characteristics, and work experiences. Business school graduates employed in a variety of work positions (N = 444) completed a Web-based survey. Presenteeism was positively associated with task significance, task interdependence, ease of replacement, and work to family conflict and negatively associated with neuroticism, equity, job security, internal health locus of control, and the perceived legitimacy of absence. Absenteeism was positively related to task significance, perceived absence legitimacy, and family to work conflict and negatively related to task interdependence and work to family conflict. Those high on neuroticism, the unconscientious, the job-insecure, those who viewed absence as more legitimate, and those experiencing work-family conflict reported more productivity loss. Overall, the results reveal the value of a behavioral approach to presenteeism over and above a strict medical model.

IMPULSIVE PHENOMENA, THE IMPULSIVE CHARACTER (DER TRIEBHAFTE CHARAKTER) AND DSM PERSONALITY DISORDERS	JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY DISORDERS			English	Article							EATING-DISORDERS	Impulsive phenomena have frequently been associated with personality disorders, beginning with Reich's description of the impulsive-character (Reich, 1925/1975). However, questions remain regarding the co-occurrence of a wide variety of impulsive phenomena and whether an underlying structure influences the differential association of impulses to individual personality disorders. Adults entering residential treatment for treatment-refractory disorders were interviewed about their lifetime histories of 33 impulse items, following independent diagnostic interviews. Factor analysis suggested 12 underlying dimensions of impulsive phenomena, explaining 68% of the variance. Borderline and antisocial PDs had the highest impulse scores, followed by self-defeating, narcissistic, depressive, and passive-aggressive PDs. Schizoid, avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, and dependent types were negatively associated with impulsive phenomena. Individuals with the highest impulse scores showed higher levels of borderline, antisocial and either self-defeating or passive-aggressive personality pathology, and were characterized by high Neuroticism and Openness and low Agreeableness on the NEO-FFI. Personality disorders and the NEO-FFI personality traits both predicted unique variance in impulsive phenomena, with the former predominating. Our findings bear striking similarities to Reich's (1925/1975) descriptions of the impulsive character.	[Perry, J.

Early studies have shown that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition controls neuronal excitability and thus the occurrence of seizures. However, more complex, and at times unexpected, mechanisms of GABAergic signaling have been identified during epileptiform discharges over the last few years. Here, we will review experimental data that point at the paradoxical role played by GABA(A) receptor-mediated mechanisms in synchronizing neuronal networks, and in particular those of limbic structures such as the hippocampus, the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, or the amygdala. After having summarized the fundamental characteristics of GABA(A) receptor-mediated mechanisms, we will analyze their role in the generation of network oscillations and their contribution to epileptiform synchronization. Whether and how GABA(A) receptors influence the interaction between limbic networks leading to ictogenesis will be also reviewed. Finally, we will consider the role of altered inhibition in the human epileptic brain along with the ability of GABA(A) receptor-mediated conductances to generate synchronous depolarizing events that may lead to ictogenesis in human epileptic disorders as well.

Here, we used ERPs to demonstrate that a similar effect holds for prosodic boundaries in spoken language. Participants judged the acceptability of temporarily ambiguous English "garden path" sentences whose prosodic boundaries were either in line or in conflict with the actual syntactic structure. Sentences with incongruent boundaries were accepted less than those with missing boundaries and elicited a stronger on-line brain response in ERPs (N400/P600 components). Our results support the notion that mentally deleting an overt prosodic boundary is more costly than postulating a new one and extend previous findings, suggesting an immediate role of prosody in sentence comprehension. Importantly, our study also provides new details on the profile and temporal dynamics of the closure positive shift (CPS), an ERP component assumed to reflect prosodic phrasing in speech and music in real time. We show that the CPS is reliably elicited at the onset of prosodic boundaries in English sentences and is preceded by negative components. Its early onset distinguishes the speech CPS in adults both from prosodic ERP correlates in infants and from the "music CPS" previously reported for trained musicians.

In particular, neglect has been demonstrated to be related to the contralesional side of the subject's body (egocentric reference frames) as well as to the contralesional side of individual objects irrespective of their position to the patient (object-based reference frame). There has been discussion whether this distinction separates neglect into body-and object-based forms. The present experiment aimed to prove possible interactions between object-based and egocentric aspects in spatial neglect. Neglect patients' eye and head movements were recorded while they explored objects at five egocentric positions along the horizontal dimension of space. The patients showed both egocentric as well as object-based behavior. Most interestingly, data analysis revealed that object-based neglect varied with egocentric position. Although the neglect of the objects' left side was strong at contralesional egocentric positions, it ameliorated at more ipsilesional egocentric positions of the objects. The patients showed steep, ramp-shaped patterns of exploration for objects located on the far contralesional side and a broadening of these patterns as the locations of the objects shifted more to the ipsilesional side. The data fitted well with the saliency curves predicted by a model of space representation, which suggests that visual input is represented in two modes simultaneously: in veridical egocentric coordinates and in within-object coordinates.

Observations: We describe the first case of RPLS in a 65-year-old woman who underwent ustekinumab therapy for psoriasis. Approximately 2 1/2 years after the patient began ustekinumab therapy, she experienced an acute onset of confusion, headache, nausea, vomiting, and seizures. Computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images of her head revealed characteristic findings, including white matter abnormalities consistent with edema in the absence of infarction. There was no evidence of vasospasm, thrombosis, or infection. Cerebrospinal fluid tests were negative for the JC virus. The patient improved clinically and was discharged 6 days after she presented to the emergency department. She made a full neurologic recovery, with a reversal of the radiologic findings. Conclusions: Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is an increasingly recognized neurologic disorder that has been reported with the use of systemic and biologic agents to treat moderate to severe psoriasis. Although the relationship between RPLS and ustekinumab therapy remains unclear, this case emphasizes the need for dermatologists to recognize the syndrome's signs and symptoms and to refer patients promptly for evaluation and appropriate treatment if the clinical features of RPLS are suspected.

So far, most investigations of primary immunodeficiency disorders have focused on those conferring susceptibility to viral, bacterial, or mycobacterial infections, providing powerful insight into human determinants of host resistance to these microbes. Monogenic disorders that increase susceptibility to fungal infections are increasingly being recognised. Although infections associated with these disorders are probably less common than are iatrogenic associated mycoses, they provide valuable insight into human immunity to fungal infections. Investigation of these immunological pathways will ultimately lead to improvements in management of such infections in secondarily immunocompromised patients.

The netrin-1 receptor, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), is upregulated by repeated amphetamine treatment selectively in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of adult rats and wild-type mice. Furthermore, adult dcc heterozygous mice fail to show amphetamine-induced increases in VTA DCC expression and do not develop sensitization to this drug. Objectives The effects of netrin-1 receptor signaling on mesocorticolimbic dopamine system function change across development. However, the effects of AMPH on DCC receptor regulation and behavioral sensitization before puberty have not been determined. Here we examined whether (1) repeated amphetamine treatment would also alter DCC expression in juvenile rats and wild-type mice, and (2) dcc heterozygotes treated with amphetamine during the juvenile period (PND 22-32) would develop behavioral sensitization to this drug. Results Repeated amphetamine downregulates DCC expression selectively in the VTA of juvenile rodents. Moreover, the behavioral phenotype of adult dcc heterozygous mice is not present before puberty and is abolished by amphetamine treatment during the juvenile period. Remarkably, adult dcc heterozygotes pretreated with amphetamine as juveniles no longer exhibit reduced DCC expression in the VTA compared to wild-type controls. Conclusions Our results indicate that netrin-1 receptor signaling may be a key factor in determining individual differences in vulnerability to the behaviorally sensitizing effects of amphetamine at different ages. Moreover, they suggest that the juvenile period marks a window of vulnerability during which exposure to stimulant drugs can reverse the behavioral phenotype of adult dcc heterozygous mice.

However, little is known about the type of model and conditions of observation that can optimize learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of the model's handedness and the observer's viewpoint on the learning of a complex spatiotemporal task. Four groups of right-handed participants observed, from either a first- or third-person viewpoint, right- or left-handed models performing the task. Observation resulted in significant learning. More importantly, observation of same-handed models resulted in improved learning as compared with observation of opposite-handed models, regardless of the observer's viewpoint. This suggests that the action observation network (AON) is more sensitive to the model's handedness than to the observer's viewpoint. Our results are consistent with recent studies that suggest that the AON is linked to or involves sensorimotor regions of the brain that simulate motor programming as if the observed movement was performed with one's own dominant hand.

Imaging studies performed after unilateral stimulation have shown conflicting results regarding the effects of tDCS on surrogate markers of neuronal activity. The aim of this study was to directly measure these effects on activation-induced changes in regional cerebral blood flow (Delta rCBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) during bilateral tDCS. Nine healthy subjects underwent repeated rCBF measurements with O-15-water and PET during a simple motor task while receiving tDCS or sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were also assessed before and after real and sham stimulation. During tDCS with active movement, Delta rCBF in M1 was significantly lower on the cathodal than the anodal side when compared with sham stimulation. This decrease in Delta rCBF was accompanied by a decrease in MEP amplitude on the cathodal side. No effect was observed on resting or activated rCBF relative to sham stimulation. We thus conclude that it is the interaction of cathodal tDCS with activation-induced Delta rCBF rather than the effect on resting or activated rCBF itself which constitutes the physiological imaging correlate of tDCS.

We identify and explain these challenges, some of which are rarely discussed in contemporary medicine and biomedical ethics, partly because they are not considered genuine "ethical" challenges per se. Most of these challenges are heavily shaped by broader social context and institutional practices, which highlights the importance of nonbiological aspects of the care of young persons with cerebral palsy from an ethics standpoint.

Moreover, recent studies on children with cerebral palsy seem to indicate that this population is at higher risk for sleep disorders. The importance of the recognition and treatment of sleep problems in children with cerebral palsy cannot be overemphasized. It is well known that the consequences of sleep disorders in children are broad and affect both the child and family. This review article explores the types and possible risk factors associated with the development of sleep problems in children with cerebral palsy and the impact of this disorder on the child and family. In addition, a brief summary of current diagnostic and treatment modalities is provided. Finally, the characteristics, diagnostic techniques, and management of sleep-related breathing disorders in children with cerebral palsy are discussed.

Bcl-x(L) regulates metabolic efficiency of neurons through interaction with the mitochondrial F1F0 ATP synthase	NATURE CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article							MANGANESE-SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; CELL-DEATH; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; BCL-X; OXIDATIVE-PHOSPHORYLATION; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; UNCOUPLING PROTEIN-2; INNER MITOCHONDRIAL; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS	Anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins such as Bcl-x(L) protect cells from death by sequestering apoptotic molecules, but also contribute to normal neuronal function. We find in hippocampal neurons that Bcl-x(L) enhances the efficiency of energy metabolism. Our evidence indicates that Bcl-x(L)interacts directly with the beta-subunit of the F1F0 ATP synthase, decreasing an ion leak within the F1F0 ATPase complex and thereby increasing net transport of H+ by F1F0 during F1F0 ATPase activity. By patch clamping submitochondrial vesicles enriched in F1F0 ATP synthase complexes, we find that, in the presence of ATP, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Bcl-x(L) activity increases the membrane leak conductance. In addition, recombinant Bcl-x(L) protein directly increases the level of ATPase activity of purified synthase complexes, and inhibition of endogenous Bcl-x(L) decreases the level of F1F0 enzymatic activity. Our findings indicate that increased mitochondrial efficiency contributes to the enhanced synaptic efficacy found in Bcl-x(L)-expressing neurons.

Towards resolving the transcription factor network controlling myelin gene expression	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							BASIC-PROTEIN GENE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; UCSC GENOME BROWSER; PROBE LEVEL DATA; OLIGODENDROCYTE DIFFERENTIATION; REGULATORY SEQUENCES; NONCODING SEQUENCES; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; PROGENITOR-CELL; TRANSGENIC MICE	In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is produced from spirally-wrapped oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and, as exemplified by the debilitating effects of inherited or acquired myelin abnormalities in diseases such as multiple sclerosis, it plays a critical role in nervous system function. Myelin sheath production coincides with rapid up-regulation of numerous genes. The complexity of their subsequent expression patterns, along with recently recognized heterogeneity within the oligodendrocyte lineage, suggest that the regulatory networks controlling such genes drive multiple context-specific transcriptional programs. Conferring this nuanced level of control likely involves a large repertoire of interacting transcription factors (TFs). Here, we combined novel strategies of computational sequence analyses with in vivo functional analysis to establish a TF network model of coordinate myelin-associated gene transcription. Notably, the network model captures regulatory DNA elements and TFs known to regulate oligodendrocyte myelin gene transcription and/or oligodendrocyte development, thereby validating our approach. Further, it links to numerous TFs with previously unsuspected roles in CNS myelination and suggests collaborative relationships amongst both known and novel TFs, thus providing deeper insight into the myelin gene transcriptional network.

Investigation into the cross-correlation of salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase responses to psychological stress	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Cortisol; Salivary alpha-amylase; Covariance; Psychological stress	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; SYMPATHETIC-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; HUMAN-PAROTID-GLAND; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; ADRENERGIC ACTIVITY; ENZYME-SECRETION; FACTOR RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; HUMANS; ORGANIZATION	Stress is a multidimensional construct. To accurately represent stress physiology, multiple stress measures across multiple stress-related systems should be assessed. However, associations may be masked given that different systems underlie different time courses. Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA) are reliable biological stress markers of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, respectively. Studies examining the link between sAA and cortisol levels in response to stress have produced inconsistent results. Here, we investigated whether the covariance of stress-induced sAA and cortisol release is dependent on the distinct temporal dynamics of the two stress markers. A total of 50 male participants were exposed to a psychological laboratory stressor with high frequency (2-min interval) saliva sampling in two independent studies. Synchronized time series of sAA and cortisol measures before, during and after stress induction were obtained. Cross-correlation analysis was applied to test for the association of sAA and cortisol levels at various stages relative to the onset of the stressor. Positive and negative cross-correlations between lagged pairs of sAA and cortisol measures were found in both studies. The strongest correlation was found for sAA preceding cortisol release by 13.5 min (r = .27, p < .001). With a smaller effect size cortisol also significantly preceded sAA by 13.5 min (r = -.16, p < .001). We suggest that sAA and cortisol stress responses are reliably associated at various time lags throughout a stressful situation. As a possible connection site between HPA axis and SNS that may underlie sAA-cortisol associations, we discuss CRF neurons of the hypothalamus involved in sympathetic regulation.

J	Mendrek, A; Lakis, N; Jimenez, J				Mendrek, Adrianna; Lakis, Nadia; Jimenez, Jose			Associations of sex steroid hormones with cerebral activations during mental rotation in men and women with schizophrenia	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; fMRI; Visuo-spatial processing; Testosterone; Estradiol; Sex differences	NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; ESTROGEN; GONADOTROPINS; TESTOSTERONE; SEVERITY	Sex steroid hormones have been implicated in the visuo-spatial abilities in the general population, as well as in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, almost nothing is known about the association between levels of testosterone and/or estrogen with brain activations during visuo-spatial processing in schizophrenia. The fMRI data collected during performance of a mental rotation task in 42 schizophrenia patients (21 women) and 42 matched controls, were correlated with the levels of testosterone and estrogen. Results revealed significant relationship between sex steroid hormones and cerebral activations in healthy men and in schizophrenia women, but no correlations were detected in healthy women or in male patients. The lack of correlations and the overall diminished levels of testosterone in male patients are consistent with some existing literature. On the other hand, the findings of augmented levels of testosterone and its implication in cerebral activations in female patients are unprecedented and merit further exploration.

X-linked VACTERL With Hydrocephalus Syndrome: Further Delineation of the Phenotype Caused by FANCB Mutations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A			English	Article						Fanconi anemia; FANCB; VACTERL; hydrocephalus; X-inactivation	COMPLEMENTATION GROUP-B; TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA; CHROMOSOME BREAKAGE; ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA; ANEMIA PATHWAY; ASSOCIATION; DEFECTS; GENE; INHERITANCE; FAMILY	X-linked VACTERL-hydrocephalus syndrome (X-linked VACTERL-H) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the gene FANCB which underlies Fanconi Anemia (FA) complementation group B. Cells from affected males have increased chromosome breakage on exposure to DNA cross-linking agents. Only five FANCB mutations found in six affected males, including an affected uncle and nephew, have been reported. We have identified FANCB mutations in a further four affected families. The VACTERL-H phenotype segregates as an X-linked recessive trait in three of these. Each mutation is predicted to truncate the FANCB open reading frame and results in highly skewed X-inactivation in unaffected carrier females. Phenotypic data were available on six affected males. Comparison of the clinical findings in our patients with published clinical data (total 12 patients) shows that ventriculomegaly, bilateral absent thumbs and radii, vertebral defects, renal agenesis, and growth retardation are the major phenotypic signs in affected males. Less frequent are brain, pituitary, ear and eye malformations, gastrointestinal atresias (esophageal, duodenal and anal), tracheoesophageal fistula, lung segmentation defects, and small genitalia. Three of six of our patients survived the perinatal period. One boy lived up to 2 years 10 months but developed aplastic anemia and died of renal failure. These data show that loss-of-function FANCB mutations result in a recognizable, multiple malformation phenotype in hemizygous males for which we propose clinical criteria to aid diagnosis.

An Anatomically Based Imaging Sign to Detect Adventitial Cyst Derived from the Superior Tibiofibular Joint	CLINICAL ANATOMY			English	Article						Ganglion cyst; adventitial cystic disease; synovial cyst; articular theory; imaging patterns	PERONEAL INTRANEURAL GANGLIA; POPLITEAL ARTERY; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; ARTICULAR BRANCH; KNEE-JOINT; INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION; DISEASE; ANATOMY; NERVE; DEGENERATION	The origin for complex intraneural cysts remains controversial despite recent emerging evidence to support their articular origin. The coexistence of intraneural and adventitial cysts has been described due to the proximate neurovascular bundle, i.e., the articular (neural) branch and vessels at the joint capsule. To clarify the pathogenesis, anatomically based imaging patterns can be identified. This paper characterizes a common finding identified on MRI describing the adventitial component originating from the superior tibiofibular joint (STFJ). MRIs of patients with fibular (peroneal) (n = 24) and tibial (n = 7) intraneural ganglion cysts were reviewed. Eleven patients with fibular intraneural ganglion cysts were identified as having a coexisting adventitial component. In all cases, the adventitial cyst extended from the anterior portion of the STFJ, within the capsular vessels, and along the anterior tibial vessels. The reproducible anatomy permitted the identification of an imaging pattern: the "vascular U" sign, consisting of cystic anterior tibial vessels running through the interosseous membrane between the proximal tibia and fibula. This sign was seen on axial MR image(s) obtained at the level of the fibular neck in all cases. To generalize these findings, the rare tibial intraneural ganglion cysts (derived from the posterior aspect of the STFJ) were examined; two cases had coexisting adventitial cysts with visualization of the vascular U sign. This new imaging pattern can improve the identification of adventitial cysts at the level of the STFJ. Clin. Anat. 24:893-902, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

On netrin-1 stimulation, DCC is phosphorylated and induces the assembly of signaling complexes within the growth cone, leading to activation of cytoskeleton regulators, namely the GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. The molecular mechanisms that link netrin-1/DCC to the actin machinery remain unclear. In this study we seek to demonstrate that the actin-binding proteins ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) are effectors of netrin-1/DCC signaling in embryonic cortical neurons. We show that ezrin associates with DCC in a netrin-1-dependent manner. We demonstrate that netrin-1/DCC induces ERM phosphorylation and activation and that the phosphorylation of DCC is required in that context. Moreover, Src kinases and RhoA/Rho kinase activities mediate netrin-1-induced ERM phosphorylation in neurons. We also observed that phosphorylated ERM proteins accumulate in growth cone filopodia, where they colocalize with DCC upon netrin-1 stimulation. Finally, we show that loss of ezrin expression in cortical neurons significantly decreases axon outgrowth induced by netrin-1. Together, our findings demonstrate that netrin-1 induces the formation of an activated ERM/DCC complex in growth cone filopodia, which is required for netrin-1-dependent cortical axon outgrowth.

Brain Connectivity: Gender Makes a Difference	NEUROSCIENTIST			English	Review						gender; anatomical connectivity; morphometric connectivity; functional connectivity; brain network	HUMAN CORPUS-CALLOSUM; DIFFUSION TENSOR TRACTOGRAPHY; SMALL-WORLD NETWORKS; LOBE WHITE-MATTER; SEX-DIFFERENCES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL THICKNESS; LIFE-SPAN; DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES; UNDERLYING INTELLIGENCE	It has been well known that gender plays a critical role in the anatomy and function of the human brain, as well as human behaviors. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated gender effects on not only focal brain areas but also the connectivity between areas. Specifically, structural MRI and diffusion MRI data have revealed substantial gender differences in white matter based anatomical connectivity. Structural MRI data further demonstrated gender differences in the connectivity revealed by morphometric correlation among brain areas. Functional connectivity derived from functional neuroimaging (e.g., functional MRI and PET) data is also modulated by gender. Moreover, male and female human brains display differences in the network topology that represents the organizational patterns of brain connectivity across the entire brain. In this review, the authors summarize recent findings in the nnultimodal brain connectivity/network research with gender, focusing on large-scale data sets derived from modern neuroimaging techniques. The literature provides convergent evidence for a substantial gender difference in brain connectivity within the human brain that possibly underlies gender-related cognitive differences. Therefore, it should be mandatory to take gender into account when designing experiments or interpreting results of brain connectivity/network in health and disease. Future studies will likely be conducted to explore the interdependence between gender-related brain connectivity/network and the gender-specific nature of brain diseases as well as to investigate gender-related characteristics of multimodal brain connectivity/network in the normal brain.

MAPPINO Collaboration	Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Preterm Infants: An Individual-Patient Data Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials	PEDIATRICS			English	Review						inhaled nitric oxide; chronic lung disease; respiratory disease; preterm infants; individual-patient data meta-analysis	SEVERE RESPIRATORY-FAILURE; CHRONIC LUNG-DISEASE; PREMATURE-INFANTS; BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA; DISTRESS-SYNDROME; VENTILATION; THERAPY; GROWTH; INJURY; MODEL	BACKGROUND: Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is an effective therapy for pulmonary hypertension and hypoxic respiratory failure in term infants. Fourteen randomized controlled trials (n = 3430 infants) have been conducted on preterm infants at risk for chronic lung disease (CLD). The study results seem contradictory. DESIGN/METHODS: Individual-patient data meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials of preterm infants (<37 weeks' gestation). Outcomes were adjusted for trial differences and correlation between siblings. RESULTS: Data from 3298 infants in 12 trials (96%) were analyzed. There was no statistically significant effect of iNO on death or CLD (59% vs 61%: relative risk [RR]: 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92-1.01]; P = .11) or severe neurologic events on imaging (25% vs 23%: RR: 1.12 [95% CI: 0.98-1.28]; P = .09). There were no statistically significant differences in iNO effect according to any of the patient-level characteristics tested. In trials that used a starting iNO dose of >5 vs <= 5 ppm there was evidence of improved outcome (interaction P = .02); however, these differences were not observed at other levels of exposure to iNO. This result was driven primarily by 1 trial, which also differed according to overall dose, duration, timing, and indication for treatment; a significant reduction in death or CLD (RR: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.74-0.98]) was found. CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of iNO for treatment of respiratory failure in preterm infants cannot be recommended. The use of a higher starting dose might be associated with improved outcome, but because there were differences in the designs of these trials, it requires further examination.

J	Humbert, L; Kneeshaw, D				Humbert, Lionel; Kneeshaw, Daniel			Identifying insect outbreaks: a comparison of a blind-source separation method with host vs non-host analyses	FORESTRY			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SPRUCE BUDWORM OUTBREAKS; TREE-RING EVIDENCE; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; BOREAL FOREST; GROWTH; DISTURBANCE; DYNAMICS; DEFOLIATION; COMPETITION	The identification of past insect outbreaks is often determined using a comparison of host/non-host tree ring growth chronologies. Yet this may be a problem when non-hosts are either affected by the outbreaking insect or when the growth of host and non-host trees does not respond similarly to the same climatic factors. We investigate the use of a blind source separation method to identify past outbreaks. This method, used in neurology and called independent components analysis (ICA), directly identifies disturbance patterns. We analysed the tree-ring data from papers dealing with insect outbreaks. These papers focus on western spruce budworm, pandora moth and Douglas-fir tussock moth outbreaks. We compared the results of the original analyses, conducted using the host/non-host approach, with results from ICA. We detected the outbreaks identified in the original papers. However, the start and end dates for the outbreaks were different in 75 per cent of the ICA analyses. On the other hand, we were able to detect growth reduction in non-host Ponderosa pine chronologies as well as increased growth during outbreak periods. Since conventional methods may be less robust when the growth of non-host trees is affected, the ICA may provide a powerful new method to identify outbreaks in such situation.

Truncating mutations in NRXN2 and NRXN1 in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia	HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							EXCITATORY SYNAPSE FORMATION; COPY NUMBER VARIATION; ALPHA-NEUREXINS; MENTAL-RETARDATION; STRUCTURAL VARIANTS; BETA-NEUREXINS; DELETION; GENES; NEUROLIGINS; REARRANGEMENTS	Growing genetic evidence is converging in favor of common pathogenic mechanisms for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID or mental retardation) and schizophrenia (SCZ), three neurodevelopmental disorders affecting cognition and behavior. Copy number variations and deleterious mutations in synaptic organizing proteins including NRXN1 have been associated with these neurodevelopmental disorders, but no such associations have been reported for NRXN2 or NRXN3. From resequencing the three neurexin genes in individuals affected by ASD (n = 142), SCZ (n = 143) or non-syndromic ID (n = 94), we identified a truncating mutation in NRXN2 in a patient with ASD inherited from a father with severe language delay and family history of SCZ. We also identified a de novo truncating mutation in NRXN1 in a patient with SCZ, and other potential pathogenic ASD mutations. These truncating mutations result in proteins that fail to promote synaptic differentiation in neuron coculture and fail to bind either of the established postsynaptic binding partners LRRTM2 or NLGN2 in cell binding assays. Our findings link NRXN2 disruption to the pathogenesis of ASD for the first time and further strengthen the involvement of NRXN1 in SCZ, supporting the notion of a common genetic mechanism in these disorders.

Here we examined the effect of exposure to a 26-h T cycle (T26, 1 h:25 h LD) on patterns of expression of the clock protein, PERIOD2 (PER2), in the SCN and in four regions of the limbic forebrain known to exhibit robust circadian oscillations in PER2: the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov), central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and dentate gyrus (DG). All rats showed stable entrainment of running wheel activity rhythms to the T26 cycle. As previously shown, PER2 expression in the SCN was stably entrained, peaking around the onset of locomotor activity. In contrast, exposure to the T26 cycle uncoupled the rhythms of PER2 expression in the BNSTov and CEA from that of the SCN, whereas PER2 rhythms in the BLA and DG were unaffected. These results show that exposure to long light cycles can uncouple circadian oscillators in select nuclei of the limbic forebrain from the SCN clock and suggest that such cycles may be used to study the functional consequences of coupling and uncoupling of brain circadian oscillators.

Neuroimaging findings and comorbidities data were extracted from the Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry for children born in a 4-year birth interval (1999-2002) covering half of the province's population. Neuroimaging studies were classified into 10 mutually exclusive categories (periventricular white matter injury/leukomalacia, cerebral malformation, cerebral vascular accident, deep gray matter injury, superficial gray matter injury, diffuse gray matter injury, intracranial hemorrhage, infection, nonspecific findings, and normal). Comorbidities studied included cortical blindness, severe auditory impairment, inability to communicate verbally, assisted feeding, and the presence of afebrile seizures in the prior 12 months. Neuroimaging results were available for a total of 213 children. Only deep gray matter injury (defined as signal abnormality or volume loss in subcortical gray matter, n = 9) was significantly (P < 0.05) linked with the occurrence of both the inability to communicate verbally (n = 5, 55.6% vs n = 46, 22.5%, P = 0.04) and with a higher mean number of comorbidities (1.67 vs 0.70, P < 0.01), and therefore with increased burden of comorbidities. These findings may improve our ability to prognosticate the outcome of children with cerebral palsy, enabling targeted early direct interventions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Developmental changes in adolescents' neural response to challenge	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Adolescents; fMRI; Emotion x cognition interaction; Anterior insula		Adolescents often fail to adaptively regulate their emotions and behaviors. This is most clearly demonstrated by the marked increase during this period in fatalities that are attributable to preventable causes. Using functional magnetic resonance methodology, this study explored whether adolescents and adults differed in their engagement of prefrontal circuitry in response to a cognitive and emotional challenge. Twenty-four adolescents and twenty-three adults were scanned while they solved difficult math problems with induced failure and negative social evaluation. Data is reported from 23 adolescents and 23 adults. Adult and adolescent participants showed similar increases in heart rate when responding to the experimental challenge. Despite the similarity of the autonomic response, adolescents recruited a more restricted network of prefrontal regions as compared to adults. Both adolescents and adults recruited the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, however adults additionally recruited the anterior insula. Functional connectivity between the anterior insula and other prefrontal regions was stronger in adults as compared to adolescents. Further, for adults, the magnitude of activity in the insula predicted lower autonomic activity in response to the challenge. Differences between adolescents and adults engagement of prefrontal networks may relate to adolescents' poor behavioral and emotional regulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Context dependence of receptive field remapping in superior colliculus. J Neurophysiol 106: 1862-1874, 2011. First published July 13, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00288.2011.-Our perception of the positions of objects in our surroundings is surprisingly unaffected by movements of the eyes, head, and body. This suggests that the brain has a mechanism for maintaining perceptual stability, based either on the spatial relationships among visible objects or internal copies of its own motor commands. Strong evidence for the latter mechanism comes from the remapping of visual receptive fields that occurs around the time of a saccade. Remapping occurs when a single neuron responds to visual stimuli placed pre-saccadically in the spatial location that will be occupied by its receptive field after the completion of a saccade. Although evidence for remapping has been found in many brain areas, relatively little is known about how it interacts with sensory context. This interaction is important for understanding perceptual stability more generally, as the brain may rely on extraretinal signals or visual signals to different degrees in different contexts. Here, we have studied the interaction between visual stimulation and remapping by recording from single neurons in the superior colliculus of the macaque monkey, using several different visual stimulus conditions. We find that remapping responses are highly sensitive to low-level visual signals, with the overall luminance of the visual background exerting a particularly powerful influence. Specifically, although remapping was fairly common in complete darkness, such responses were usually decreased or abolished in the presence of modest background illumination. Thus the brain might make use of a strategy that emphasizes visual landmarks over extraretinal signals whenever the former are available.

We describe here the unique case of a sellar paraganglioma that extended into the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. We have also reviewed all reported cases of sellar paragangliomas to better define best management strategies. Clinical presentation: A 63-year-old male presented with left eye proptosis and conjunctival vessel dilatation. Intervention: Resection of the intraorbital component of the tumor was accomplished using a transcranial-transorbital approach. Conclusion: This is the first report of a sellar/parasellar paraganglioma extending into the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. While an appropriate treatment paradigm has not been established, a review of all previously reported cases suggests that radiotherapy is an important consideration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

METHOD Six electronic databases (PsychINFO, Embase, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, PubMed, and AMED) were searched using the following keywords to identify all studies that examined the predictive validity of the GMsA: 'general movements', 'assessment', 'movement', 'child development', 'infant', and 'predictive value of test'. Only English-and French-language studies were included, whereas studies that focused on spontaneous mobility in preterm infants, but not necessarily the GMsA, or which did not report on the predictive value of the GMsA were excluded. A total of 39 studies were included in the final analysis. RESULTS Studies were separated according to the age at follow-up: 12 to 23 months, 2 to 3, 4 to 11, and 12 to 18 years. All used a longitudinal cohort study design; however, the outcome measures differed greatly amongst the studies. Values for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value varied amongst studies. The overall trend indicated that the presence of abnormalities in the quality of fidgety movements at 12 weeks adjusted age is more predictive of adverse outcomes than abnormal writhing movements. INTERPRETATION The GMsA demonstrates potential as a cost-effective, non-intrusive means of infant examination. However, current studies include important sources of bias. Future methodologically rigorous studies with functional outcomes are suggested.

Chymotrypsin C (Caldecrin) Is Associated with Enamel Development	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						amelogenesis; CTRC; enamel; serine proteases; caldecrin; chymotrypsin C; biomineralization	CALCIUM-DECREASING FACTOR; HYPOMATURATION AMELOGENESIS-IMPERFECTA; PORCINE PANCREAS; DENTAL ENAMEL; EXPRESSION; KLK4; MUTATION; PROTEIN; CLONING; MATURATION	Two main proteases cleave enamel extracellular matrix proteins during amelogenesis. Matrix metalloprotease-20 (Mmp20) is the predominant enzyme expressed during the secretory stage, while kallikrein-related peptidase-4 (Klk4) is predominantly expressed during maturation. Mutations to both Mmp20 and Klk4 result in abnormal enamel phenotypes. During a recent whole-genome microarray analysis of rat incisor enamel organ cells derived from the secretory and maturation stages of amelogenesis, the serine protease chymotrypsin C (caldecrin, Ctrc) was identified as significantly up-regulated (> 11-fold) during enamel maturation. Prior reports indicate that Ctrc expression is pancreas-specific, albeit low levels were also noted in brain. We here report on the expression of Ctrc in the enamel organ. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot analysis were used to confirm the expression of Ctrc in the developing enamel organ. The expression profile of Ctrc is similar to that of Klk4, increasing markedly during the maturation stage relative to the secretory stage, although levels of Ctrc mRNA are lower than for Klk4. The discovery of a new serine protease possibly involved in enamel development has important implications for our understanding of the factors that regulate enamel biomineralization.	[Lacruz, R.

J	Sherwin, BB; Chertkow, H; Schipper, H; Nasreddine, Z				Sherwin, Barbara B.; Chertkow, Howard; Schipper, Hyman; Nasreddine, Ziad			A randomized controlled trial of estrogen treatment in men with mild cognitive impairment	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Mild cognitive impairment; Elderly men; Estrogen; Testosterone; Verbal memory; Randomized controlled trial	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ELDERLY-MEN; OLDER MEN; TESTOSTERONE SUPPLEMENTATION; THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS; VERBAL MEMORY; WOMEN; DEMENTIA; STEROIDS; BRAIN	This randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study investigated whether estrogen treatment would have a beneficial effect on tests of verbal memory in men with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Forty-three men newly diagnosed with MCI were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests before randomly receiving 12 weeks of treatment with estrogen or placebo followed by a 12 week cross-over treatment. A significant improvement in the total score, and in two subscale scores of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test occurred following estrogen treatment compared to both pretreatment and post-placebo scores (p<0.05). However, benefit occurred only in the men who had received estrogen for 12 weeks following 12 weeks of placebo. Although these findings tentatively suggest that treatment with estrogen may improve verbal memory in men with MCI, the fact that the improvement occurred only in the group that received estrogen following 12 weeks of placebo and the absence of improvement on every test of verbal memory administered suggests that these findings need to be replicated using a larger sample size.

Autoantibodies as biomarkers for the prediction of neuropsychiatric events in systemic lupus erythematosus	ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES			English	Article							RIBOSOMAL-P PROTEIN; INTERNATIONAL INCEPTION COHORT; ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODIES; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; PREVALENCE; ASSOCIATION; DISEASE; PSYCHOSIS; DIAGNOSIS	Objective Neuropsychiatric events occur unpredictably in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and most biomarker associations remain to be prospectively validated. This study examined a disease inception cohort of 1047 SLE patients to determine which autoantibodies at enrolment predicted subsequent neuropsychiatric events. Methods Patients with a recent SLE diagnosis were assessed prospectively for up to 10 years for neuropsychiatric events using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions. Decision rules of graded stringency determined whether neuropsychiatric events were attributable to SLE. Associations between the first neuropsychiatric event and baseline autoantibodies (lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin, anti-beta(2) glycoprotein-I, anti-ribosomal P and anti-NR2 glutamate receptor) were tested by Cox proportional hazards regression. Results Disease duration at enrolment was 5.4 +/- 4.2 months, follow-up was 3.6 +/- 2.6 years. Patients were 89.1% female with mean (+/- SD) age 35.2 +/- 13.7 years. 495/1047 (47.3%) developed one or more neuropsychiatric event (total 917 events). Neuropsychiatric events attributed to SLE were 15.4% (model A) and 28.2% (model B). At enrolment 21.9% of patients had LA, 13.4% anticardiolipin, 15.1% anti-beta(2) glycoprotein-I, 9.2% anti-ribosomal P and 13.7% anti-NR2 antibodies. LA at baseline was associated with subsequent intracranial thrombosis (total n=22) attributed to SLE (model B) (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.94). Anti-ribosomal P antibody was associated with subsequent psychosis (total n=14) attributed to SLE (model B) (HR 3.92, 95% CI 1.23 to 12.5, p=0.02). Other autoantibodies did not predict neuropsychiatric events. Conclusion In a prospective study of 1047 recently diagnosed SLE patients, LA and anti-ribosomal P antibodies are associated with an increased future risk of intracranial thrombosis and lupus psychosis, respectively.

Participants' age-onset of sign language acquisition ranged from birth to 14 years: length of sign language experience was substantial and did not vary in relation to age of acquisition. For both tasks, a more left lateralized pattern of activation was observed, with activity for grammatical judgment being more anterior than that observed for phonemic-hand judgment, which was more posterior by comparison. Age of acquisition was linearly and negatively related to activation levels in anterior language regions and positively related to activation levels in posterior visual regions for both tasks.

Methods: Forty healthy seniors performed two visual working memory tasks requiring different levels of mental effort, while ECG was recorded. They underwent the same tasks and recordings 2 weeks later. Traditional and 13 non-linear indices of HRV including Poincare, entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) were determined. Results: Time domain, especially mean R-R interval (RRI), frequency domain and, among non-linear parameters - Poincare and DFA were the most reliable indices. Mean RRI, time domain and Poincare were also the most sensitive to different mental effort task loads and had the largest effect size. Conclusions: Overall, linear measures were the most sensitive and reliable indices to mental effort. In non-linear measures, Poincare was the most reliable and sensitive, suggesting possible usefulness as an independent marker in cognitive function tasks in healthy seniors. Significance: A large number of HRV parameters was both reliable as well as sensitive indices of mental effort, although the simple linear methods were the most sensitive.

Sensitive periods in human development: Evidence from musical training	CORTEX			English	Review						Motor learning; Musical rhythm; Auditory-motor integration; Timing; Development; Plasticity; Age of acquisition	PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; WHITE-MATTER DEVELOPMENT; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ABSOLUTE PITCH; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; NORMAL-CHILDREN; YOUNG-CHILDREN	One of the primary goals of cognitive neuroscience is to understand the interaction between genes, development and specific experience. A particularly fascinating example of this interaction is a sensitive period - a time during development when experience has a differential effect on behavior and the brain. Behavioral and brain imaging studies in musicians have provided suggestive evidence for a possible sensitive period for musical training; showing that musicians who began training early show better task performance and greater changes in auditory and motor regions of the brain. However, these studies have not controlled for likely differences between early- (ET) and late-trained (LT) musicians in the number of years of musical experience. This review presents behavioral work from our laboratory comparing the performance of ET (before age seven) and LT musicians who were matched for years of experience on the ability to tap in synchrony with auditory and visual rhythms. The results demonstrate the existence of a possible sensitive period for musical training that has its greatest impact on measures of sensorimotor integration. Work on motor learning in children and how this might relate to the observed sensitive period effect is also reviewed. These studies are described in the context of what is currently known about sensitive periods in animals and humans; drawing on evidence from anatomy and physiology, studies of deafness, as well as structural and functional neuroimaging studies in trained musicians. The possible mechanisms underlying sensitive periods for musical training are discussed based on current theories describing the influence of both low-level features of sensory experience and higher-level cognitive processing.

This review aims to explore the radiographic, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of calvarial neoplastic, inflammatory, and congenital lesions that are common in adults in order to facilitate a structured approach to their diagnosis and limit the differential diagnosis. In addition to reviewing the literature, we reviewed the records of 141 patients of the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital with radiologically documented calvarial lesions between 2001 and June 2009. CT is ideal for detecting bony lesions and is helpful in precisely localizing a lesion pre-surgically. MRI is best at identifying intradiploic lesions before they affect the cortical tables and is able to establish extraosseous involvement, especially when paramagnetic contrast is employed.

Methods: Two years prospective study in a tertiary referral center. Tests consist on Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) and sound localization after 6 months of BAHA use. Quality of life was assessed by the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire. The paired T-test and the analysis of variance were used for the statistical measures. Results: Twenty-one subjects participated in this study. HINT: patients score better when speech and noise are spatially separated and noise is not presented to the healthy ear. In the right-handed group (left dominant brain), unaided left-implanted patients performed better than right-implanted patient when speech is in front and noise to the good ear; when speech is presented to the good ear and noise to the front, aided right-implanted patients performed better than aided left-implanted patients. Sound localization: correct answers attain 35% at best. No statistical difference between the frequencies was found, neither between the left and right implanted patients. APHAB: the score improvement is statistically significant for the global score, the background noise subscale at 5 weeks and for the reverberation subscale at 6 months. Conclusion: It seems that left dominant hemisphere is able to filter crossed noise better than the right hemisphere. Results of uncrossed speech to the dominant left brain are better than the uncrossed speech to the non-dominant right brain. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Biochemical characterization and in vitro activity of AZ513, a noncovalent, reversible, and noncompetitive inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Fatty acid amide hydrolase; Cannabinoids; CB(1) receptor; Anandamide; Enzyme inhibitor`	SUBSTANTIA-GELATINOSA NEURONS; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RAT SPINAL-CORD; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; GAMMA-SECRETASE; MECHANISM; INACTIVATION; ANANDAMIDE; FAAH; DISCOVERY	Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) hydrolyzes several bioactive lipids including the endocannabinoid anandamide. Synthetic FAAH inhibitors are being generated to help define the biological role(s) of this enzyme, the lipids it degrades in vivo, and the disease states that might benefit from its pharmacological modulation. AZ513 inhibits human FAAH (IC(50)=551 nM), is 20-fold more potent against rat FAAH (IC(50)=27 nM), and is inactive at 10 mu m against the serine hydrolases acetylcholinesterase, thrombin, and trypsin. In contrast to most other potent FAAH inhibitors, AZ513 showed no evidence of covalently modifying the enzyme and displayed reversible inhibition. In an enzyme cross-competition assay. AZ513 did not compete with OL-135, an inhibitor that binds to the catalytic site in FAAH, which indicates that AZ513 does not bind to the catalytic site and is therefore noncompetitive with respect to substrate. AZ513 has good cell penetration as demonstrated by inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis in human FAAH-transfected HEK293 cells (IC(50)= 360 nM). AZ513 was tested in a rat spinal cord slice preparation where CBI activation reduces excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs). In this native tissue assay of synaptic activity, AZ513 reduced EPSCs, which is consistent with inhibiting endogenous FAAH and augmenting endocannabinoid tone. AZ513 has a unique biochemical profile compared with other published FAAH inhibitors and will be a useful tool compound to further explore the role of FAAH in various biological processes.

NUCLEUS-SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF MEAL DURATION ON DAILY PROFILES OF PERIOD1 AND PERIOD2 PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN RATS HOUSED UNDER RESTRICTED FEEDING	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						circadian clock gene; dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus; oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; central nucleus of the amygdala; basolateral amygdala; dentate gyrus	DORSOMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; FOOD-ANTICIPATORY ACTIVITY; ENTRAINABLE CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; STRIA TERMINALIS; LIMBIC FOREBRAIN; CLOCK PROTEIN; OVAL NUCLEUS; GENE-EXPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNA	Restricted feeding (RF) schedules provide a cycle of fasting and feeding each day and induce circadian rhythms in food-anticipatory activity. In addition, daily rhythms in the expression of circadian clock genes, such as rhythms in Period1 (PER1) or Period2 (PER2), are also shifted in many brain areas that are important for the regulation of motivation and emotion. In order to differentiate brain areas that respond to the time of food presentation from areas that are sensitive to the degree of restriction, the present study compared RF schedules that provided rats with either a 2 h-meal (2hRF) or a 6 h-meal (6hRF) each day. As expected, 2hRF was associated with less food-consumption, more weight-loss, and more food-anticipatory running-wheel activity than 6hRF. In association with these metabolic and behavioral differences, the daily pattern of PERI and PER2 expression in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), which has been proposed to be integral to the generation and/or maintenance of food-anticipatory activities, peaked earlier in the 2hRF group and later in the 6hRF group. Because both RF groups exhibited approximately synchronous food-anticipatory activity, but phase shifted rhythms of PER1 and PER2 expression in the DMH, it suggests that the phase of food-anticipatory activity is not directly regulated by this brain area. Next, daily rhythms of PER2 expression in the limbic forebrain responded to each RF schedule in a nucleus-specific manner. In some brain areas, the amplitude of the PER2 rhythm was differentially adjusted in response to 2hRF and 6hRF, while other areas, responded similarly to both RF schedules. These findings demonstrate that daily rhythms of clock gene expression can be modulated by the motivational state of the animal, as influenced by meal duration, weight loss and food-consumption.

Autocrine Netrin Function Inhibits Glioma Cell Motility and Promotes Focal Adhesion Formation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GROWTH-CONE ATTRACTION; COLORECTAL-CANCER DCC; SPINAL-CORD; AXON GUIDANCE; TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION; FILOPODIA FORMATION; BRAIN-TUMORS; RECEPTOR DCC; C-ELEGANS; EXPRESSION	Deregulation of mechanisms that control cell motility plays a key role in tumor progression by promoting tumor cell dissemination. Secreted netrins and their receptors, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), neogenin, and the UNC5 homologues, regulate cell and axon migration, cell adhesion, and tissue morphogenesis. Netrin and netrin receptor expression have previously been shown to be disrupted in invasive tumors, including glioblastoma. We determined that the human glioblastoma cell lines U87, U343, and U373 all express neogenin, UNC5 homologues, and netrin-1 or netrin-3, but only U87 cells express DCC. Using transfilter migration assays, we demonstrate DCC-dependent chemoattractant migration of U87 cells up a gradient of netrin-1. In contrast, U343 and U373 cells, which do not express DCC, were neither attracted nor repelled. Ectopic expression of DCC by U343 and U373 cells resulted in these cells becoming competent to respond to a gradient of netrin-1 as a chemoattractant, and also slowed their rate of spontaneous migration. Here, in addition to netrins' well-characterized chemotropic activity, we demonstrate an autocrine function for netrin-1 and netrin-3 in U87 and U373 cells that slows migration. We provide evidence that netrins promote the maturation of focal complexes, structures associated with cell movement, into focal adhesions. Consistent with this, netrin, DCC, and UNC5 homologues were associated with focal adhesions, but not focal complexes. Disrupting netrin or DCC function did not alter cell proliferation or survival. Our findings provide evidence that DCC can slow cell migration, and that neogenin and UNC5 homologues are not sufficient to substitute for DCC function in these cells. Furthermore, we identify a role for netrins as autocrine inhibitors of cell motility that promote focal adhesion formation. These findings suggest that disruption of netrin signalling may disable a mechanism that normally restrains inappropriate cell migration.

In the brain, PSA is exclusively synthesized by the two polysialyltransferases ST8SiaII (also known as STX) and ST8SiaIV (also known as PST). By modulating adhesive property of NCAM, PSA plays a critical role in several neural development processes such as cell migration, neurite outgrowth, axon pathfinding, synaptogenesis and activity-dependent plasticity. The expression of PSA is temporally and spatially regulated during neural development and a tight regulation of PSA expression is essential to its biological function. In mouse visual cortex, PSA is downregulated following eye opening and its decrease allows the maturation of GABAergic synapses and the opening of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. Relatively little is known about how PSA levels are regulated by sensory experience and neuronal activity. Here, we demonstrate that while both ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV mRNA levels decrease around the time of eye opening in mouse visual cortex, only ST8SiaII mRNA level reduction is regulated by sensory experience. Using an organotypic culture system from mouse visual cortex, we further show that ST8SiaII gene expression is regulated by spiking activity and NMDA-mediated excitation. Further, we show that both ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV mRNA levels are positively regulated by PKC-mediated signaling. Therefore, sensory experience-dependent ST8SiaII gene expression regulates PSA levels in postnatal visual cortex, thus acting as molecular link between visual activity and PSA expression.

We hypothesized that dysregulated translation regulation pathways may underlie neuropathic pain. Peripheral nerve injury induced reorganization of translation machinery in the peripheral nervous system of rats and mice, including enhanced mTOR and ERK activity, increased phosphorylation of mTOR and ERK downstream targets, augmented eIF4F complex formation and enhanced nascent protein synthesis. The AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, metformin and A769662, inhibited translation regulation signaling pathways, eIF4F complex formation, nascent protein synthesis in injured nerves and sodium channel-dependent excitability of sensory neurons resulting in a resolution of neuropathic allodynia. Therefore, injury-induced dysregulation of translation control underlies pathology leading to neuropathic pain and reveals AMPK as a novel therapeutic target for the potential treatment of neuropathic pain.

We investigated here the possible role of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), p38 and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in CGRP regulation following chronic morphine treatment. Results: A 7-day treatment with morphine (15 mu g/day) led to an increase in CGRP contents in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and this effect was prevented by the inhibition of the ERK, p38 or CaMKII pathway. The phosphorylation/activation of ERK, p38 and CaMKII was enhanced in the SCDH following chronic morphine while in DRG only the phosphorylation of CaMKII was increased. Moreover, our chronic morphine treatment up-regulated neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) levels in the SCDH, an effect blocked by the inhibition of the ERK, p38 or CaMKII pathway. The blockade of nNOS activity also suppressed chronic morphine-induced CGRP increases in the DRG and SCDH. Double immunofluorescence studies revealed that nNOS and CaMKII are co-localized in the SCDH and that CaMKII is activated in CGRP-expressing DRG neurons. Conclusions: The activation of spinal ERK, p38 and CaMKII, alongside nNOS, is involved in chronic morphine-induced CGRP up-regulation in both the DRG and SCDH. Moreover, the stimulation of CaMKII in the DRG likely directly regulates the expression of CGRP associated with morphine analgesic tolerance.

Although Lcn2 is expressed in a number of aseptic inflammatory conditions, its role in these conditions remains unclear. We examined the expression and role of Lcn2 after spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult mice by using a contusion injury model. Lcn2 expression at the protein level is rapidly increased 12-fold at 1 d after SCI and decreases gradually thereafter, being three times as high as control levels at 21 d after injury. Lcn2 expression is strongly induced after contusion injury in astrocytes, neurons, and neutrophils. The Lcn2 receptor (Lcn2R), which has been shown to influence cell survival, is also expressed after SCI in the same cell types. Lcn2-deficient (Lcn2(-/-)) mice showed significantly better locomotor recovery after spinal cord contusion injury than wild-type (Lcn2(+/+)) mice. Histological assessments indicate improved neuronal and tissue survival and greater sparing of myelin in Lcn2(-/-) mice after contusion injury. Flow cytometry showed a decrease in neutrophil influx and a small increase in the monocyte population in Lcn2(-/-) injured spinal cords. This change was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of several pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase early after SCI in Lcn2(-/-) mice compared with wild-type animals. Our results, therefore, suggest a role for Lcn2 in regulating inflammation in the injured spinal cord and that lack of Lcn2 reduces secondary damage and improves locomotor recovery after spinal cord contusion injury.

The Functional Link between Area MT Neural Fluctuations and Detection of a Brief Motion Stimulus	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DECISION-RELATED ACTIVITY; TEMPORAL VISUAL AREA; CORTICAL AREA; PERCEPTUAL DECISION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; SENSORY NEURONS; TASK STRATEGY; V2 NEURONS; MACAQUE MT; CHOICE	Fluctuations of neural firing rates in visual cortex are known to be correlated with variations in perceptual performance. It is important to know whether these fluctuations are functionally linked to perception in a causal manner or instead reflect non-causal processes that arise after the perceptual decision is made. We recorded from middle temporal (MT) neurons from monkey subjects while they detected the random occurrence of a brief 50 ms motion pulse that occurred in either of two (or simultaneously in both) random dot patches located in the same hemisphere. The receptive field parameters of the motion pulse were matched to that preferred by each MT neuron under study. This task contained uncertainty in both space and time because, on any given trial, the subjects did not know which patch would contain the motion pulse or when the motion pulse would occur. Covariations between MT activity and behavior began just before the motion pulse onset and peaked at the maximum neural response. These neural-behavioral covariations were strongest when only one patch contained the motion pulse and were still weakly present when a patch did not contain a motion pulse. A feedforward temporal integration model with two independent detector channels captured both the detection performance and evolution of the neural-behavior covariations over time and stimulus condition. The results suggest that, when detecting a brief visual stimulus, there is a causal relationship between fluctuations in neural activity and variations in behavior across trials.	[Smith, Jackson E.

Repeated Vulvovaginal Fungal Infections Cause Persistent Pain in a Mouse Model of Vulvodynia	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							NOCICEPTIVE SENSORY INNERVATION; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; VESTIBULITIS SYNDROME; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; GENITAL-TRACT; GLABROUS SKIN; RAT; WOMEN; IMMUNE; ENDOMETRIOSIS	Provoked vestibulodynia, the most common form of vulvodynia (unexplained pain of the vulva), is a prevalent, idiopathic pain disorder associated with a history of recurrent candidiasis (yeast infections). It is characterized by vulvar allodynia (painful hypersensitivity to touch) and hyperinnervation. We tested whether repeated, localized exposure of the vulva to a common fungal pathogen can lead to the development of chronic pain. A subset of female mice subjected to recurrent Candida albicans infection developed mechanical allodynia localized to the vulva. The mice with allodynia also exhibited hyperinnervation with peptidergic nociceptor and sympathetic fibers (as indicated by increased protein gene product 9.5, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 immunoreactivity in the vaginal epithelium). Long-lasting behavioral allodynia in a subset of mice was also observed after a single, extended Candida infection, as well as after repeated vulvar (but not hind paw) inflammation induced with zymosan, a mixture of fungal antigens. The hypersensitivity and hyperinnervation were both present at least 3 weeks after the resolution of infection and inflammation. Our data show that infection can cause persistent pain long after its resolution and that recurrent yeast infection replicates important features of human provoked vulvodynia in the mouse.

The 24-hour stability of a levothyroxine solution admixed and stored in three common infusion containers and infused through polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing was evaluated. Methods. Levothyroxine sodium 1-mu g/mL injection prepared in glass bottles and PVC and polyolefin bags were assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours; samples drawn directly from the containers, as well as from the distal end of attached PVC tubing, were assayed. The area under the time-versus-concentration curve (AUC) for predicted and delivered doses was calculated; analysis of variance was used for comparison of the percentages of predicted and actual AUC values. Results. The levothyroxine concentration was stable in glass bottles and polyolefin bags through 24 hours (mean +/- S.D. percentage of initial concentration remaining, 103.5% +/- 2.5% and 100.0% +/- 2.9%, respectively). In the PVC infusion bags, the amount of drug decreased to 90% of the initial concentration within 1 hour and then rose and remained within acceptability limits. The levothyroxine concentration of the samples infused through PVC line from glass and polyolefin containers decreased after 1 hour by about 13%; the loss of the drug from the samples infused from PVC bags was higher (18%), presumably due to additive adsorptive effects. In all samples tested, the drug concentration rebounded and remained above 90% to the end of the study. Conclusion. Levothyroxine sodium 1-mu g/mL solution was stable for 24 hours in glass bottles and polyolefin bags but when stored in PVC bags, the concentration decreased by 10% after 1 hour.

Mercury exposure and risks from dental amalgam in the US population, post-2000	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mercury; Dental amalgam; Exposure; Risk	RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIAL; LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; ORAL AIR MERCURY; BREAST-MILK; INORGANIC MERCURY; OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE; CREATININE EXCRETION; CHEMICAL-COMPOUNDS; FISH CONSUMPTION; LACTATING WOMEN	Dental amalgam is 50% metallic mercury (Hg) by weight and Hg vapour continuously evolves from in-place dental amalgam, causing increased Hg content with increasing amalgam load in urine, faeces, exhaled breath, saliva, blood, and various organs and tissues including the kidney, pituitary gland, liver, and brain. The Hg content also increases with maternal amalgam load in amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, meconium, various foetal tissues including liver, kidney and brain, in colostrum and breast milk. Based on 2001 to 2004 population statistics, 181.1 million Americans carry a grand total of 1.46 billion restored teeth. Children as young as 26 months were recorded as having restored teeth. Past dental practice and recently available data indicate that the majority of these restorations are composed of dental amalgam. Employing recent US population-based statistics on body weight and the frequency of dentally restored tooth surfaces, and recent research on the incremental increase in urinary Hg concentration per amalgam-filled tooth surface, estimates of Hg exposure from amalgam fillings were determined for 5 age groups of the US population. Three specific exposure scenarios were considered, each scenario incrementally reducing the number of tooth surfaces assumed to be restored with amalgam. Based on the least conservative of the scenarios evaluated, it was estimated that some 67.2 million Americans would exceed the Hg dose associated with the reference exposure level (REL) of 03 mu g/m(3) established by the US Environmental Protection Agency; and 122.3 million Americans would exceed the dose associated with the REL of 0.03 mu g/m(3) established by the California Environmental Protection Agency. Exposure estimates are consistent with previous estimates presented by Health Canada in 1995, and amount to 02 to 0.4 mu g/day per amalgam-filled tooth surface, or 0.5 to 1 mu g/day/amalgam-filled tooth, depending on age and other factors.

Effects of FGF-23 on skeleton, phosphate homeostasis, and cardiovascular system have been investigated; however, the effect of FGF-23 on the central nervous system (CNS) is unknown. To assess whether FGF-23 influences the function and structure of the CNS and whether the effect of FGF-23 on the CNS is mediated by FGF receptors directly or by hypophosphatemia indirectly, FGF-23 transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates were fed a normal diet or a high-phosphate diet containing a normal diet plus 1.25% phosphate in drinking water from weaning for 5 weeks and the phenotypes of the CNS were compared between FGF-23 transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates on the same diet. At the end of this time period, transgenic animals on the normal diet showed impaired spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, these mice exhibited the impairment of long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 region, and the reduction of hippocampal adenosine-triphosphate content and of choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in basal forebrain, possibly as pathogenetic factors contributing to the cognitive deficit. The central nervous phenotypes of transgenic mice were rescued following improved hypophosphatemia by the high-phosphate diet intake. This study demonstrates that FGF-23 overexpression can result in abnormalities in the CNS mediated by the secondary severe hypophosphatemia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Incubations were performed in situ within macrophytes beds using low-level spikes of (199)HgO and Me(200)Hg stable isotopes as tracers. To determine which microbial guilds are playing a role in these processes, methylation/demethylation experiments were performed in the absence and presence of different metabolic inhibitors: chloramphenicol (general bacteriostatic inhibitor), molybdate (sodium molybdate, a sulfate reduction inhibitor), BESA (2-bromoethane sulfonic acid, a methanogenesis inhibitor), and DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1 dimethyl urea, a photosynthesis inhibitor). Active microbes of the periphytic consortium were also characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Methylation rates in the absence of inhibitors varied from 0.0015 to 0.0180 d(-1) while demethylation rates ranged from 0.083 to 0.217 d(-1), which corresponds to a net methylmercury balance of - 0.51 to 1.28 ng gDW periphyton(-1) d(-1). Methylation rates were significantly decreased by half by DCMU and chloramphenicol, totally inhibited by BESA, and were highly stimulated by molybdate. This suggests that methanogens rather than sulfate reducing bacteria were likely the primary methylators in the periphyton of a temperate fluvial lake, a conclusion supported by the detection of 16S rRNA gene sequences that were closely related to those of methanogens. This first clear demonstration of methanogens' role in mercury methylation in environmental periphyton samples expands the known diversity of microbial guilds that contribute to the formation of the neurotoxic substance methylmercury.

GeoSentinel Surveillance Network	Patterns of Illness in Travelers Visiting Mexico and Central America: The GeoSentinel Experience	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							DISEASES; SURVEILLANCE; SPECTRUM; MALARIA	Background. Mexico and Central America are important travel destinations for North American and European travelers. There is limited information on regional differences in travel related morbidity. Methods. We describe the morbidity among 4779 ill travelers returned from Mexico and Central America who were evaluated at GeoSentinel network clinics during December 1996 to February 2010. Results. The most frequent presenting syndromes included acute and chronic diarrhea, dermatologic diseases, febrile systemic illness, and respiratory disease. A higher proportion of ill travelers from the United States had acute diarrhea, compared with their Canadian and European counterparts (odds ratio, 1.9; P < .0001). During the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak from March 2009 through February 2010, the proportionate morbidity (PM) associated with respiratory illnesses in ill travelers increased among those returned from Mexico, compared with prior years (196.0 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers vs 53.7 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers; P < .0001); the PM remained constant in the rest of Central America (57.3 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers). We identified 50 travelers returned from Mexico and Central America who developed influenza, including infection due to 2009 H1N1 strains and influenza-like illness. The overall risk of malaria was low; only 4 cases of malaria were acquired in Mexico (PM, 2.2 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers) in 13 years, compared with 18 from Honduras (PM, 79.6 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers) and 14 from Guatemala (PM, 34.4 cases per 1000 ill returned travelers) during the same period. Plasmodium vivax malaria was the most frequent malaria diagnosis. Conclusions. Travel medicine practitioners advising and treating travelers visiting these regions should dedicate special attention to vaccine-preventable illnesses and should consider the uncommon occurrence of acute hepatitis A, leptospirosis, neurocysticercosis, acute Chagas disease, onchocerciasis, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, neurocysticercosis, HIV, malaria, and brucellosis.

Regional brain atrophy in children with multiple sclerosis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							GRAY-MATTER ATROPHY; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; GREY; MRI; MS; DISABILITY; VOLUME	We used cross-sectional tensor-based morphometry to visualize reduced volume in the whole brains of pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis, relative to healthy controls. As a marker of local volume difference, we used the Jacobian determinant of the deformation field that maps each subject to a standard space. To properly assess abnormal differences in volume in this age group, it is necessary to account for the normal, age-related differences in brain volume. This was accomplished by computing normalized z-score Jacobian determinant values at each voxel to represent the local volume difference (in standard deviations) between an individual subject and an age- and sex-matched healthy normal population. Compared with healthy controls, pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis exhibited significantly reduced volumes within the thalamus and the splenium of the corpus callosum and significant expansions in the ventricles. While T2-weighted lesion volume was correlated with reduced splenium volume, no correlation was found between T2-weighted lesion volume and reduced thalamic volume. Reduced volumes of the optic pathways, including that of the optic tracts and optic radiations, correlated with disease duration. Our results suggest that focal inflammatory lesions may play an important role in tract degeneration, including transsynaptic degeneration. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Since different MR image contrasts can yield complementary information, multi-contrast images can be incorporated into the active appearance modeling to improve segmentation performance. During active appearance modeling, the weighting of each contrast is optimized to account for the potentially varying contribution of each image while optimizing the model parameters that correspond to the shape and appearance eigen-images in order to minimize the difference between the multi-contrast test images and the ones synthesized from the shape and appearance modeling. As appearance-based modeling techniques are dependent on the initial alignment of training data, we compare (i) linear alignment of whole brain, (ii) linear alignment of a local volume of interest and (iii) non-linear alignment of a local volume of interest. The proposed segmentation scheme can be used to segment human hippocampi (HC) and amygdalae (AG). which have weak intensity contrast with their background in MRI. The experiments demonstrate that non-linear alignment of training data yields the best results and that multimodal segmentation using T1-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density-weighted images yields better segmentation results than any single contrast. In a four-fold cross validation with eighty young normal subjects, the method yields a mean Dice kappa of 0.87 with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.946 for HC and a mean Dice kappa of 0.81 with ICC of 0.924 for AG between manual and automatic labels.

J	Schulz, K; Vulpe, CD; Harris, LZ; David, S				Schulz, Katrin; Vulpe, Chris D.; Harris, Leah Z.; David, Samuel			Iron Efflux from Oligodendrocytes Is Differentially Regulated in Gray and White Matter	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-ANCHORED FORM; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SEX-LINKED ANEMIA; PARANODAL JUNCTIONS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; PRECURSOR CELLS; RAT-BRAIN; CERULOPLASMIN; MICE	Accumulation of iron occurs in the CNS in several neurodegenerative diseases. Iron is essential for life but also has the ability to generate toxic free radicals if not properly handled. Iron homeostasis at the cellular level is therefore important to maintain proper cellular function, and its dysregulation can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Iron export, a key mechanism to maintain proper levels in cells, occurs via ferroportin, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein that partners with a ferroxidase. A membrane-bound form of the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin is expressed by astrocytes in the CNS and regulates iron efflux. We now show that oligodendrocytes use another ferroxidase, called hephaestin, which was first identified in enterocytes in the gut. Mice with mutations in the hephaestin gene (sex-linked anemia mice) show iron accumulation in oligodendrocytes in the gray matter, but not in the white matter, and exhibit motor deficits. This was accompanied by a marked reduction in the levels of the paranodal proteins contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr) and reticulon-4 (Nogo A). We show that the sparing of iron accumulation in white matter oligodendrocytes in sex-linked anemia mice is due to compensatory upregulation of ceruloplasmin in these cells. This was further confirmed in ceruloplasmin/hephaestin double-mutant mice, which show iron accumulation in both gray and white matter oligodendrocytes. These data indicate that gray and white matter oligodendrocytes can use different iron efflux mechanisms to maintain iron homeostasis. Dysregulation of such efflux mechanisms leads to iron accumulation in the CNS.

However, the extent to which the human brain responds to external stimuli during sleep is uncertain. We used simultaneous EEG and functional MRI to characterize brain responses to tones during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sounds during wakefulness elicited responses in the thalamus and primary auditory cortex. These responses persisted in NREM sleep, except throughout spindles, during which they became less consistent. When sounds induced a K complex, activity in the auditory cortex was enhanced and responses in distant frontal areas were elicited, similar to the stereotypical pattern associated with slow oscillations. These data show that sound processing during NREM sleep is constrained by fundamental brain oscillatory modes (slow oscillations and spindles), which result in a complex interplay between spontaneous and induced brain activity. The distortion of sensory information at the thalamic level, especially during spindles, functionally isolates the cortex from the environment and might provide unique conditions favorable for off-line memory processing.

Fabp7) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (Gfap). We used these transcripts to demarcate the distribution of spinal cord radial glia (SCRG) and screen for SCRG gene expression in the Allen Spinal Cord Atlas (ASCA). We reveal that neonatal and adult SCRG are anchored in a non-ventricular niche at the spinal cord (SC) pial boundary, and express a "signature" subset of 122 genes, many of which are shared with "classic" neural stem cells (NSCs) of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and SC central canal (CC). A core expressed gene set shared between SCRG and progenitors of the SVZ and CC is particularly enriched in genes associated with human disease. Visualizing SCRG in a Fabp7-EGFP reporter mouse reveals an extensive population of SCRG that extend processes around the SC boundary and inwardly (through) the SC white matter (WM), whose abundance increases in a gradient from cervical to lumbar SC. Confocal analysis of multiple NSC-enriched proteins reveals that postnatal SCRG are a discrete and heterogeneous potential progenitor population that become activated by multiple SC lesions, and that CC progenitors are also more heterogeneous than previously appreciated. Gene ontology analysis highlights potentially unique regulatory pathways that may be further manipulated in SCRG to enhance repair in the context of injury and SC disease.

Past studies, which have mostly examined each attentional mechanism in isolation, indicate that volitional and reflexive orienting depend on two functionally specialized cortical networks in the human brain. Here we investigated how the interplay between these two cortical networks affects sensory processing and the resulting overt behavior. By combining measurements of human performance and electrocortical recordings with a novel analytical technique for estimating spatiotemporal activity in the human cortex, we found that the subregions that comprise the reflexive ventrolateral attention network dissociate both spatially and temporally as a function of the nature of the sensory information and current task demands. Moreover, we found that together with the magnitude of the early sensory gain, the spatiotemporal neural dynamics accounted for the high amount of the variance in the behavioral data. Collectively these data support the conclusion that the ventrolateral attention network is recruited flexibly to support complex behaviors.

Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Trial of Early Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Celiac Plexus Neurolysis to Prevent Pain Progression in Patients With Newly Diagnosed, Painful, Inoperable Pancreatic Cancer	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article							MUSCLE SORENESS; BLOCK; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; LIFE	Purpose Celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is currently used as salvage therapy for morphine-resistant pancreatic cancer pain. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided CPN (EUS-CPN) can be performed early, at the time of EUS. We hypothesized that early EUS-CPN would reduce pain and morphine consumption, increase quality of life (QOL), and prolong survival. Patients and Methods Patients were eligible if referred for EUS for suspected pancreatic cancer with related pain. If EUS and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology confirmed inoperable adenocarcinoma, patients were randomly assigned to early EUS-CPN or conventional pain management. Pain scores (7-point Likert scale), morphine equivalent consumption, and QOL scores (Digestive Disease Questionnaire-15) were assessed at 1 and 3 months. Results Five hundred eighty eligible patients were seen between April 2006 and December 2008. Ninety-six patients were randomly assigned (48 patients per study arm). Pain relief was greater in the EUS-CPN group at 1 month and significantly greater at 3 months (difference in mean percent change in pain score = -28.9 [ 95% CI, -67.0 to 2.8], P = .09, and - 60.7 [ 95% CI, -86.6 to -25.5], P = .01, respectively). Morphine consumption was similar in both groups at 1 month (difference in mean change in morphine consumption = -1.0 [ 95% CI, -47.7 to 49.2], P = .99), but tended toward lower consumption at 3 months in the neurolysis group (difference in mean change in morphine consumption = -49.5 [ 95% CI, -127.5 to 7.0], P = .10). There was no effect on QOL or survival. Conclusion Early EUS-CPN reduces pain and may moderate morphine consumption in patients with painful, inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. EUS-CPN can be considered in all such patients at the time of diagnostic and staging EUS.

It is estimated that at least 30% to 40% of individuals remain without a precise diagnosis despite extensive investigations. We mapped tremor-ataxia with central hypomyelination (TACH) to 10q22.3-23.1 in French-Canadian families and sequenced candidate genes within this interval. Two missense and one insertion mutations in five individuals with TACH were uncovered in POLR3A, which codes for the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Because these families were mapped to the same locus as leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO) and presented clinical and radiological overlap with individuals with hypomyelination, hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H) syndrome, we sequenced this gene in nine individuals with 411 and eight with LO. In total, 14 recessive mutations were found in 19 individuals with TACH, 4H, or LO, establishing that these leukodystrophies are allelic. No individual was found to carry two nonsense mutations. Immunoblots on 411 fibroblasts and on the autopsied brain of an individual diagnosed with 414 documented a significant decrease in POLR3A levels, and there was a more significant decrease in the cerebral white matter compared to that in the cortex. Pol III has a wide set of target RNA transcripts, including all nuclear-coded tRNA. We hypothesize that the decrease in POLR3A leads to dysregulation of the expression of certain Pol III targets and thereby perturbs cytoplasmic protein synthesis. This type of broad alteration in protein synthesis is predicted to occur in other leukoencephalopathies such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-3, caused by mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein I (AIMP1).

Membrane-type Matrix Metalloproteinase-3 Regulates Neuronal Responsiveness to Myelin through Nogo-66 Receptor 1 Cleavage	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; P75 NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; AXONAL REGENERATION; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; CELL-MIGRATION; INHIBITORS; GROWTH; GLYCOPROTEIN; PROTEIN	Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor for myelin-associated inhibitors that restricts plasticity and axonal regrowth in the CNS. NgR1 is cleaved from the cell surface of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner; however, the mechanism and physiological consequence of NgR1 shedding have not been explored. We now demonstrate that NgR1 is shed from multiple populations of primary neurons. Through a loss-of-function approach, we found that membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MT3-MMP) regulates endogenous NgR1 shedding in primary neurons. Neuronal knockdown of MT3-MMP resulted in the accumulation of NgR1 at the cell surface and reduced the accumulation of the NgR1 cleavage fragment in medium conditioned by cortical neurons. Recombinant MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT5-MMPs promoted NgR1 shedding from the surface of primary neurons, and this treatment rendered neurons resistant to myelin-associated inhibitors. Introduction of a cleavage-resistant form of NgR1 reconstitutes the neuronal response to these inhibitors, demonstrating that specific metalloproteinases attenuate neuronal responses to myelin in an NgR1-dependent manner.

The qkI locus on 6q26-27 has also been implicated as a candidate tumor suppressor gene as the qkI locus maps to a region of genetic instability in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor of astrocytic lineage. As GBM frequently harbors mutations affecting p53, we crossbred qk(v) and p53 mutant mice to examine whether qk(v) mice on a p53(-/-) background have an increased incidence of GBM. qk(v/v); p53(-/-) mice had a reduced survival rate compared to p53(-/-) littermates, and the cause of death of the majority of the mice remains unknown. In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed Purkinje cell degeneration in the cerebellum. These results suggest that p53 and qkI are genetically linked for neuronal maintenance and survival.

These changes are the result of an interaction between hormonal state and maternal experience and are associated with increased dendritic spine density in this area. Here, we examined whether this upregulation of astrocytic proteins generalized to other glial markers and, in particular those associated with glutamate metabolism. We chose glial markers commonly used to reflect different aspects of glial function: vimentin, like GFAP, is a marker of intermediate filaments; glutamine synthetase (GS), and S-100beta, are used as markers for mature astrocytes and GS has also been used as a specific marker for glutamatergic enzymatic activity. In addition, we examined levels of proteins associated with glutamine synthetase, glutamate, glutamine and two excitatory amino acid transporters found in astrocytes, glt-1 and glast. S100beta immunoreactivity did not vary with reproductive state in either Cg2 or MPOA suggesting no change in the number of mature astrocytes across these conditions. Vimentin-ir did not differ across groups in Cg2, but expression of this protein decreased from Day 1 postpartum onwards in the MPOA. By contrast, GS-ir was increased within 24 h postpartum in Cg2 but not MPOA and similarly to GFAP and bFGF this upregulation of GS resulted from an interaction between hormonal state and maternal experience. Within Cg2, upregulation of GS was not accompanied by changes in the astrocytic glutamatergic transporters, glt-1 and glast, however, an increase in both glutamate and glutamine proteins were observed within the Cg2 of postpartum animals. Together, these changes suggest postpartum upregulation of glutamatergic activity and metabolism within Cg2 that is stimulated by pregnancy hormones and maternal experience.

Echo-Time and Field Strength Dependence of BOLD Reactivity in Veins and Parenchyma Using Flow-Normalized Hypercapnic Manipulation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; 7 T; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; FMRI; ACTIVATION; HUMANS; SIGNAL; EPI	While the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) contrast mechanism has demonstrated excellent sensitivity to neuronal activation, its specificity with regards to differentiating vascular and parenchymal responses has been an area of ongoing concern. By inducing a global increase in Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF), we examined the effect of magnetic field strength and echo-time (TE) on the gradient-echo BOLD response in areas of cortical gray matter and in resolvable veins. In order to define a quantitative index of BOLD reactivity, we measured the percent BOLD response per unit fractional change in global gray matter CBF induced by inhaling carbon dioxide (CO(2)). By normalizing the BOLD response to the underlying CBF change and determining the BOLD response as a function of TE, we calculated the change in R(2)* (Delta R(2)*) per unit fractional flow change; the Flow Relaxation Coefficient, (FRC) for 3T and 1.5T in parenchymal and large vein compartments. The FRC in parenchymal voxels was 1.76 +/- 0.54 fold higher at 3T than at 1.5T and was 2.96 +/- 0.66 and 3.12 +/- 0.76 fold higher for veins than parenchyma at 1.5T and 3T respectively, showing a quantitative measure of the increase in specificity to parenchymal sources at 3T compared to 1.5T. Additionally, the results allow optimization of the TE to prioritize either maximum parenchymal BOLD response or maximum parenchymal specificity. Parenchymal signals peaked at TE values of 62.0 +/- 11.5 ms and 41.5 +/- 7.5 ms for 1.5T and 3T, respectively, while the response in the major veins peaked at shorter TE values; 41.0 +/- 6.9 ms and 21.5 +/- 1.0 ms for 1.5T and 3T. These experiments showed that at 3T, the BOLD CNR in parenchymal voxels exceeded that of 1.5T by a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.4 at the optimal TE for each field.

Our goal was to examine how Parkinson's disease (PD) and cerebellar ataxia, as human lesion models of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, affect spatial navigation round a circular walking path, blindfolded. Twelve subjects with idiopathic PD (ON and OFF medication), eight subjects with cerebellar ataxia and a control group of 20 age-matched healthy subjects participated. All groups performed well when walking around the circle with eyes open. In the eyes-closed condition, control subjects overshot the outlined trajectory but returned to their initial position, thus walking a further distance with eyes closed than with eyes open. When OFF medication, PD subjects navigated a larger radius than controls with eyes closed. When ON levodopa, PD subjects walked a similar distance as controls but with even larger errors in endpoint. Surprisingly, cerebellar patients navigated the circular walking task in the eyes closed condition with even more accuracy (i.e. following the outlined circle) than control and PD subjects. We conclude that blindfolded navigation around a previously seen circle requires intact basal ganglia, but not cerebellar input. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent discoveries show that astrocytes modulate the activity of neuronal networks upon sustained and intense synaptic activity. However, their ability to regulate basal synaptic transmission remains ill defined and controversial. Here, we show that astrocytes in the hippocampal CA1 region detect synaptic activity induced by single-synaptic stimulation. Astrocyte activation occurs at functional compartments found along astrocytic processes and involves metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptors. In response, astrocytes increase basal synaptic transmission, as revealed by the blockade of their activity with a Ca(2+) chelator. Astrocytic modulation of basal synaptic transmission is mediated by the release of purines and the activation of presynaptic A(2A) receptors by adenosine. Our work uncovers an essential role for astrocytes in the regulation of elementary synaptic communication and provides insight into fundamental aspects of brain function.

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of axon regeneration should shed light on how this process becomes restricted in the postnatal stage and in the CNS and therefore could provide therapeutic targets for developing strategies to improve axon regeneration in the adult CNS. In this review, we first discuss the general view about nerve regeneration and the advantages of using C. elegans as a model system to study axon regeneration. We then compare the conserved regeneration patterns and molecular mechanisms between C. elegans and vertebrates. Lastly, we discuss the power of femtosecond laser technology and its application in axon regeneration research.

The Tryptophan Metabolite 3-Hydroxyanthranilic Acid Plays Anti-Inflammatory and Neuroprotective Roles During Inflammation	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article							HEME OXYGENASE-1/CARBON MONOXIDE; KYNURENINE PATHWAY METABOLISM; PRIMARY HUMAN ASTROCYTES; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; NEURONAL CELL-DEATH; INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE; QUINOLINIC ACID; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DENDRITIC CELLS	Tryptophan metabolism by the kynurenine pathway (KP) is important to the pathogenesis of inflammatory, infectious, and degenerative diseases. The 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) branch of the KP is activated in macrophages and microglia, leading to the generation of 3-HK, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), and quinolinic acid, which are considered neurotoxic owing to their free radical-generating and N-methyl-D-as-partic acid receptor agonist activities. We investigated the role of 3-HAA in inflammatory and antioxidant gene expression and neurotoxicity in primary human fetal central nervous system cultures treated with cytokines (IL-1 with or without interferon-gamma) or with Toll-like receptor ligands mimicking the proinflammatory central nervous system environment. Results were analyzed by microarray, Western blot, inununostain, enzyme-linked inununosorbent assay, and neurotoxicity assays. 3-HAA suppressed glial cytokine and chemokine expression and reduced cytokine-induced neuronal death. 3-HK also suppressed cytokine-induced neuronal death. Unexpectedly, 3-HAA was highly effective in inducing in astrocytes the expression of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), an antioxidant enzyme with anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. Optimal induction of HO-1 required 3-HAA and cytokines. In human naicroglia, 3-HAA weakly induced HO-1 and lipopolysaccharide suppressed microglial HO-1 expression. 3-HAA mediated HO-1 expression was confirmed in cultured adult human astrocytes and in vivo after 3-HAA injection to mouse brains. Together, our results demonstrate the novel neuroprotective activity of the tryptophan metabolite 3-HAA and have implications for future therapeutic approaches for neuroinflarnmatory disorders.

MDD is frequently accompanied by somatic pain symptoms and is a risk factor for chronic pain. Paradoxically, most experimental studies on pain perception in MDD have described hypoalgesic responses in patients.

Despite some positive evidence, this idea is still controversial. However, it is clear that schizophrenia is not a pain insensitivity syndrome. On neurophysiological basis, our group has gathered evidence linking schizophrenia to deficient excitatory pain mechanisms. Further studies are required, especially because insensitivity to pain in schizophrenia seems to be associated with significant functional consequences.

The study of human depression is hindered by the relatively significant heterogeneity of this disorder. As a result of these heterogeneities, studies using a sound and representative animal model of depression are extremely valuable and, in general, provide important information regarding the neurochemical/biological changes occurring during depression and the subsequent treatment of its symptoms. In this review we concentrate on two solid rat models of depression: olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rats and Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) of rats. These two models were selected because they possess all three characteristics of a good animal model; face, predictive and constructive validities. We also emphasize the brain serotonergic system and we discuss the open field and forced swim test to assess behaviour.

The clinical context brings specific constraints that include the requirement of a high channel count to cover the whole head, high sensitivity for single event detection, and portability for long-term bedside monitoring. For epilepsy and stroke monitoring, the combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is expected to provide useful clinical information, and efforts have been deployed to create prototypes able to simultaneously acquire both measurement modalities. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing systems lack portability, NIRS sensitivity, or have low channel count. We present a battery-powered, portable system with potentially up to 32 EEG channels, 32 NIRS light sources, and 32 detectors. Avalanche photodiodes allow for high NIRS sensitivity and the autonomy of the system is over 24 h. A reduced channel count prototype with 8 EEG channels, 8 sources, and 8 detectors was tested on phantoms. Further validation was done on five healthy adults using a visual stimulation protocol to detect local hemodynamic changes and visually evoked potentials. Results show good concordance with literature regarding functional activations and suggest sufficient performance for clinical use, provided some minor adjustments were made.

Several studies suggest that hypothermia may preserve myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We carried out a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia at reducing infarct size and decreasing major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and all-cause mortality in AMI patients. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, EMBASE, and MEDLINE through July 2010 for studies investigating therapeutic hypothermia in AMI patients. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers. We identified 5 studies (693 patients), 2 of which were feasibility trials and 3 of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Feasibility trials showed that therapeutic hypothermia is a safe and feasible intervention. RCTs showed that cardiac outcomes were similar at 30 days' follow-up for the hypothermia and control groups. Mean infarct size ranged from 2.0% to 14.1% of the left ventricle in the hypothermia group and from 8.0% to 13.8% of the left ventricle in the control group. MACEs ranged from 0.0% to 6.2% in the hypothermia group and 3.9% to 10.0% in the control group. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.0% to 3.4% and 2.2% to 10.0% in the hypothermia and control groups, respectively. Subgroup analyses suggested that hypothermia may reduce infarct size in patients with anterior wall infarction. Our review suggests that therapeutic hypothermia is safe and feasible. However, more evidence is needed to determine whether therapeutic hypothermia is associated with improved infarct size, MACEs, or all-cause mortality in RCTs of AMI patients.

Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy as a measure of nociceptive evoked activity in critically ill infants. Pain Res Manage 2011; 16(5):331-336. Signs of pain may be subtle or absent in a critically ill infant. The complex nature of pain may further obscure its identification and measurement. Because the use of monitoring and neuroimaging techniques has become more common in pain research, an understanding of these specialized technologies is important. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique for monitoring tissue hemodynamics and oxygenation. There are indications that NIRS is capable of detecting the cerebral hemodynamic changes associated with sensory stimuli, including pain, in infants. These developments suggest that NIRS may play an important role in research focusing on pain perception in critically ill infants. The present review briefly describes the cortical responses to noxious stimuli, which parallel cerebral hemodynamic responses to various stimuli. This is followed by an overview of NIRS technology including a summary of the literature on functional studies that have used NIRS in infants. Current NIRS techniques have well-recognized limitations that must be considered carefully during the measurement and interpretation of the signals. Nonetheless, until more advanced NIRS techniques emerge, the current devices have strengths that should be exploited.

Adrenocortical attunement in mother-child dyads: Importance of situational and behavioral characteristics	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Cortisol; Attunement; Mother-child dyad; Increased threat; Behavioral sensitivity	INFANT SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; SALIVARY CORTISOL; STRESS RESPONSES; NEUROENDOCRINE ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SEPARATION; SYNCHRONY; RISK; INTERVENTION; ATTACHMENT	Synchronization of behavior, emotions and autonomic physiology in mother-child dyads is related to adaptive functioning in children. It is important to explore the possibility of "attunement", or systematic synchronization, of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis because it is sensitive to social information processing at an unconscious level. Due to limited research in humans, the present study aimed to demonstrate mother-child cortisol attunement in a human population, and examine how behavioral sensitivity may moderate this association. Saliva samples were collected from 75 mother-child dyads during a home visit. A free-play task was used to determine behavioral sensitivity within the dyad. Findings suggest that mother-child dyads demonstrate attunement of HPA axis activity and that attunement is particularly prominent during times of increased challenge. Furthermore, results suggest factors associated with behavioral sensitivity may influence attunement within the dyad. Bidirectional synchronization of adrenocortical levels may serve to positively impact later developmental outcomes in children. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, dystonia is a complex disorder, with variable presentation, which can delay diagnosis. Methods: Data were gathered by questionnaire from 866 patients with dystonia or hemifacial spasm (HFS) treated in 14 movement disorders centres in Canada injecting botulinum toxin, to better understand the path to diagnosis, wait times and obstacles to treatment. Results: Most participants were female (64.1%), mean age was 58 years, and patients consulted an average of 3.2 physicians before receiving a dystonia or HFS diagnosis. Many patients (34%) received other diagnoses before referral to a movement disorders clinic, most commonly "stress" (42.7%). A variety of treatments were often received without a diagnosis. The mean lag time between symptom onset and diagnosis was 5.4 years. After the decision to use botulinum toxin, patients waited a mean of 3.1 months before treatment. The most common diagnoses were cervical dystonia (51.6% of patients), HFS (20.0%) and blepharospasm (9.8%). Conclusions: Survey results show that diagnosis of dystonias or of HFS, and therefore, access to treatment, is delayed. An educational program for primary care physicians may be helpful to decrease the time to diagnosis and referral to a specialist centre for treatment.

Impact of the Cognitive Status on the Memory Complaints in MS Patients	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE; RETROSPECTIVE MEMORY; IMPAIRMENT; DEPRESSION; QUESTIONNAIRE; DYSFUNCTION; AWARENESS; SYMPTOMS	Objective: Despite the evidence of cognitive deficits in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients, evaluation of their cognitive integrity is often limited to the use of clinical interviews and questionnaires. However, the consensus in the literature is that these patients under- or overestimate their deficits and repercussions. The objective of this study was to clarify why some patients overestimate while others underestimate their memory deficits. Method: Fifty-four participants (30 MS, 24 controls) completed the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) and were tested on a battery of neuropsychological tests. Based on the test results, MS patients were categorized as having either mild or moderate/severe cognitive deficits. Results: The moderate/severe MS group differed from the two other groups on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) but did not differ from the control group on the PRMQ. Conversely, the mild MS group did not differ from the control group on the RAVLT but did report significantly more problems than this group on the PRMQ. There was no difference between the two clinical groups on the Depression Index (Beck) but there was a significant correlation (r=.409) between the depression scores and the overestimation of prospective memory problems (PRMQ). Conclusion: The results explain the contradiction in the literature. It is the mild group who overestimates, maybe because they are overly concerned by their deficits, whereas the cognitive impairments of the moderate/severe group lead them to underestimate and may make their self-assessment unreliable. Formal testing or information from a significant other would be advisable.

The Effect of Intravitreal Injection of Bevacizumab on Retinal Circulation in Patients with Neovascular Macular Degeneration	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Research-in-Vision-and-Ophthalmology	MAY 03-07, 2009	Ft Lauderdale, FL	Assoc Res Vis & Ophthalmol			LASER-DOPPLER FLOWMETRY; ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; BLOOD-FLOW; CELLS; REPRODUCIBILITY; POPULATION; AVASTIN; SAFETY; EYE	PURPOSE. Intravitreal (ITV) injection of anti-VEGFs like bevacizumab are widely used to treat neovascular AMD. However, VEGF is essential for biologic functions such as blood pressure regulation. Indeed, anti-VEGF intravenous administration is associated with hypertension. Therefore, the effect of ITV bevacizumab on retinal circulation was examined. METHODS. Twenty-three patients with neovascular AMD treated with three repeat ITV injections of bevacizumab were recruited. Blood arteriolar diameter and flow measurements were performed with a bidirectional laser Doppler flowmeter at baseline, 1 week after the first injection, just before the second injection, and 5 weeks after the third injection. Scanning laser Doppler flowmetry was used to assess the effect of bevacizumab on tissue perfusion at the first and fourth visits. RESULTS. Arteriolar diameter significantly decreased from 122.5 +/- 14.5 mu m to 118.9 +/- 14.0 mu m (P = 0.03) during the first week to reach a mean value of 117.2 +/- 13.7 mu m at the end of the study (P < 0.01). Arterial blood flow did not change significantly. Neuroretinal rim perfusion decreased from 181.1 +/- 84.1 arbitrary flow units to 167.7 +/- 76.5 arbitrary flow units, which was borderline significant (P = 0.06). No significant change was observed in the peripapillary retina. CONCLUSIONS. Arteriolar diameter decreased significantly after the first injection and persisted until the end of the study suggesting a long-term effect of bevacizumab on vascular tone. However, the blood flow change is not significant. A borderline significant decrease in neuroretinal rim perfusion was observed and suggests that the neuroretinal rim may be more sensitive than the peripapillary retina to the effects of bevacizumab.

DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE (1975-May 2011), EMBASE (1980-May 2011), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1981-May 2011) were conducted to identify observational and interventional studies evaluating the efficacy or safety of NMBAs for management of acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), status asthmaticus, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and therapeutic hypothermia. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We excluded case reports, animal- Or laboratory-based studies, trials describing NMBA use during rapid sequence intubation or in the operating room, and studies published in languages other than English or French. DATA SYNTHESIS: Clinical applications of NMBAs in intensive care include, but are not limited to, immobilizing patients for procedural interventions, decreasing oxygen consumption, facilitating mechanical ventilation, reducing intracranial pressure, preventing shivering, and management of tetanus. Recent data on ARDS demonstrated that early application of NMBAs improved adjusted 90-day survival for patients with severe lung injury. These results may lead to increased use of these drugs. While emerging data support the use of cisatracurium in select patients with ALI/ARDS, current literature does not support the use of one NMBA over another for other critical care indications. Cisatracurium may be kinetically preferred for patients with organ dysfunction. Close monitoring with peripheral nerve stimulation is recommended with sustained use of NMBAs to avoid drug accumulation and minimize the risk for adverse drug events. Reversal of paralysis is achieved by discontinuing therapy or, rarely, the use of anticholinesterases. CONCLUSIONS: NMBAs are high-alert medications used to manage critically ill patients. New data are available regarding the use of these agents for treatment of ALI/ARDS and status asthmaticus, management of elevated ICP, and provision of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. To improve outcomes and promote patient safety, intensive care unit team members should have a thorough knowledge of this class of medications.

MS is a complex and chronic immune-mediated and neurodegenerative disease influenced by genetic susceptibility and environmental risk factors. The ideal treatment for MS would involve both attenuation of detrimental inflammatory responses, and induction of a degree of tissue protection/regeneration within the CNS. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that both human-derived and murine-derived MSCs are able to improve outcomes in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. How MSCs ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is being intensely investigated. One of the major mechanisms of action of MSC therapy is to inhibit various components of the immune system that contribute to tissue destruction. Emerging evidence now supports the idea that MSCs can access the CNS where they can provide protection against tissue damage, and may facilitate tissue regeneration through the production of growth factors. The prospect of cell-based therapy using MSCs has several advantages, including the relative ease with which they can be extracted from autologous bone marrow or adipose tissue and expanded in vitro to reach the purity and numbers required for transplantation, and the fact that MSC therapy has already been used in other human disease settings, such as graft-versus-host and cardiac disease, with initial reports indicating a good safety profile. This article will focus on the theoretical and practical issues relevant to considerations of MSC therapy in the context of MS.

J	Chughtai, F; Zayed, T				Chughtai, Fazal; Zayed, Tarek			Integrating WRc and CERIU Condition Assessment Models and Classification Protocols for Sewer Pipelines	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Sewer pipelines; Condition classification protocols; Condition assessment models; Unsupervised neural networks		Adoption of a suitable sewer pipeline condition classification protocol is recognized as an indispensable first step in worldwide sewer rehabilitation industry. Various condition classification systems for sewers have been developed in this regard. These systems differ according to local requirements in which no integrated and unified sewer condition assessment protocol is available. Therefore, an urgent need exists to develop standardized sewer condition assessment procedures. The presented research in this paper aims to review the historical development of different sewer condition classification protocols and develop a combined condition index (CCI) for sewers that integrates the combined effect of structural and operational conditions. To achieve these objectives, unsupervised neural network models have been developed. The CCI is divided into five condition categories ranging from "acceptable" to "critical." An unsupervised, self-organizing, neural network approach is also used to develop the CCI. The opinion of municipal practitioners is utilized to verify the CCI and integrated protocol. The developed integrated models and protocols will assist municipal engineers in developing a unified sewer condition assessment system. An unsupervised neural network methodology is adapted for integrating sewer condition assessment protocols and developing the CCI of sewer pipelines.

Evidence of neuroendocrine disruption in freshwater mussels exposed to municipal wastewaters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Neuroendocrine disruption; Municipal wastewater effluents; Freshwater mussels; Oxidative stress	DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA PALLAS; ZEBRA-MUSSEL; ELLIPTIO-COMPLANATA; WASTE-WATER; DIGESTIVE GLAND; ENVIRONMENT; SEROTONIN; BIOMARKER; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; VITELLOGENESIS	The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that exposure to municipal effluents can disrupt the neuroendocrine system in Elliptio complanata freshwater mussels. The capacity of ozonation to mitigate these effects was also examined. Mussels were exposed for 14 days to a continuous flow of increasing concentrations of the effluent before and after ozonation. Neuroendocrinal effects were examined by tracking changes in acetylcholinesterase, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyrate, serotonin, dopamine and their respective adenylcyclase activities in synapse membranes, monoamine oxidase and vitellogenin-like proteins. Oxidative stress and damage were examined by superoxide dismutase and lipid peroxidation, respectively, in the visceral tissues. The results revealed that the exposure of freshwater mussels increased the levels of vitellogenin-like proteins in both the primary-treated and ozonated effluents, dopamine and glutamate, and decreased the turnover of the neurostimulant acetylcholine. Moreover, these endpoints were significantly correlated with oxidative stress and damage. A canonical analysis of the responses revealed that dopamine and the neuroexcitatory neuromediators-acetylcholesterase and glutamate-were the endpoints more strongly related with oxidative stress and damage. Mussel morphology and estrogenic biomarkers (vitellogenin-like proteins, gonad lipid stores) were also significantly related, albeit to a lesser extent, to oxidative stress and damage. In general, ozone treatment was not sufficient to mitigate the observed neuroendocrinal effects in freshwater mussels. We conclude that the continuous exposure of freshwater mussels to municipal wastewater effluents leads to neuroendrocinal alterations and to oxidative stress.

J	Sohail, ASM; Bhattacharya, P				Sohail, Abu Sayeed Md; Bhattacharya, Prabir			CLASSIFYING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS USING LEVEL SET METHOD BASED LIP CONTOUR DETECTION AND MULTI-CLASS SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Facial feature points; facial expression; variational level set method; support vector machines	AUTOMATIC-ANALYSIS; IMAGE SEQUENCES; NEURAL-NETWORK; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION	This paper describes a fully automated computer vision system for detection and classification of the seven basic facial expressions using Multi-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM). Facial expressions are communicated by subtle changes in one or more discrete features such as tightening of the lips, raising the eyebrows, opening and closing of eyes or certain combination of them, which can be identified through monitoring the changes in muscle movements (Action Units), located around the regions of mouth, eyes and eyebrows. For classifying facial expressions, an analytic representation of face with 15 feature points has been used that provides visual observation of the discrete features responsible for the seven basic facial expressions. Feature points from the region of mouth are detected by segmenting the lip contour applying a variational formulation of the level set method. A multidetector approach of facial feature point detection is utilized for identifying the feature-points from the regions of eyes, eyebrows and nose. Feature vectors composed of 15 features are then obtained with respect to the average representation of neutral face and are used to train a Multiclass SVM classifier. The proposed method has been tested over two different facial expression image databases and the average successful recognition rates of 92.04% and 86.33% have been achieved.

ELND005-AD201 Investigators	A phase 2 randomized trial of ELND005, scyllo-inositol, in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							BETA IMMUNIZATION AN1792; A-BETA; CLINICAL-TRIALS; DEMENTIA; BRAIN; SCALE; MRI; PROGRESSION; INVENTORY; DIAGNOSIS	Objective: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2 study explored safety, efficacy, and biomarker effects of ELND005 (an oral amyloid anti-aggregation agent) in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: A total of 353 patients were randomized to ELND005 (250, 1,000, or 2,000 mg) or placebo twice daily for 78 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale. The primary analysis compared 250 mg (n = 84) to placebo (n = 82) after an imbalance of infections and deaths led to early discontinuation of the 2 higher dose groups. Results: The 250 mg dose demonstrated acceptable safety. The primary efficacy analysis at 78 weeks revealed no significant differences between the treatment groups on the NTB or ADCS-ADL. Brain ventricular volume showed a small but significant increase in the overall 250 mg group (p = 0.049). At the 250 mg dose, scyllo-inositol concentrations increased in CSF and brain and CSF A beta x-42 was decreased significantly compared to placebo (p = 0.009). Conclusions: Primary clinical efficacy outcomes were not significant. The safety and CSF biomarker results will guide selection of the optimal dose for future studies, which will target earlier stages of AD. Classification of evidence: Due to the small sample sizes, this Class II trial provides insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of ELND005.

We used the dual-task procedure and recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how mental rotation of a first stimulus (51) influences the shifting of visual-spatial attention to a second stimulus (52). Visual-spatial attention was monitored by using the N2pc component of the ERP. In addition, we examined the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN) believed to index the retention of information in visual short-term memory. We found modulations of both the N2pc and the SPCN, suggesting that engaging mechanisms of mental rotation impairs the deployment of visual-spatial attention and delays the passage of a representation of 52 into visual short-term memory. Both results suggest interactions between mental rotation and visual-spatial attention in capacity-limited processing mechanisms indicating that response selection is not pivotal in dual-task delays and all three processes are likely to share a common resource like executive control.

Vascular burden was determined clinically by computing the number of vascular risk factors and diseases and neuroradiologically by assessing the presence and severity of white matter lesions (WML). Strategic memory processes were measured with free recall and temporal contextual memory tasks requiring self-initiated retrieval. Nonstrategic memory retrieval processes were appraised with a five-choice recognition procedure. Results showed that MCI participants with high vascular burden displayed impairment of strategic memory processes, whereas MCI participants with no vascular burden showed impairment of both strategic and nonstrategic memory processes. A similar pattern was found whether vascular burden was measured using a clinical index of vascular risk profile or whether it was measured neuroradiologically by assessing the extent and severity of subcortical WML However, the effect of WML on memory differed as function of level of education, used here as a proxy for cognitive reserve. Among participants with MCI, those who had higher education and no WML were the least memory impaired. The study also examined memory as a function of whether patients later progressed to dementia after a three-year follow-up. When examining progressors' performance, strategic and nonstrategic processes were both impaired in progressors with no concomitant vascular conditions, whereas progressors with a high vascular burden showed less impairment of nonstrategic than strategic processes. Overall, results indicate that the presence of vascular burden in MCI is associated with selective impairment of strategic memory processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we use event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how differences between own-race and other-race faces influence the neural correlates of memory encoding and recognition. ERPs of Asian and Caucasian participants were recorded during the study and test phases of a Remember-Know paradigm with Chinese and Caucasian faces. A behavioral other-race effect was apparent in both groups, neither of which recognized other-race faces as well as own-race faces; however, Caucasian subjects showed stronger behavioral other-race effects. In the study phase, memory encoding was assessed with the ERP difference due to memory (Dm). Other-race effects in memory encoding were only found for Caucasian subjects. For subsequently "recollected" items, Caucasian subjects showed less positive mean amplitudes for own-race than other-race faces indicating that less neural activation was required for successful memory encoding of own-race faces. For the comparison of subsequently "recollected" and "familiar" items, Caucasian subjects showed similar brain activation only for own-race faces suggesting that subsequent familiarity and recollection of own-race faces arose from similar memory encoding processes. Experience with a race also influenced old/new effects, which are ERP correlates of recollection measured during recognition testing. Own-race faces elicited a typical parietal old/new effect, whereas old/new effects for other-race faces were prolonged and dominated by activity in frontal brain regions, suggesting a stronger involvement of post-retrieval monitoring processes. These results indicate that the other-race effect is a memory encoding- and recognition-based phenomenon. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effects of oxytocin on social cognition and behaviour in frontotemporal dementia	BRAIN			English	Article						frontotemporal dementia; oxytocin; facial expressions; theory of mind	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INVENTORY; FEARFUL EXPRESSIONS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NEURAL CIRCUITRY; HUMAN-MEMORY	Patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia demonstrate abnormalities in behaviour and social cognition, including deficits in emotion recognition. Recent studies suggest that the neuropeptide oxytocin is an important mediator of social behaviour, enhancing prosocial behaviours and some aspects of emotion recognition across species. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin on neuropsychiatric behaviours and emotion processing in patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design, 20 patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia received one dose of 24 IU of intranasal oxytocin or placebo and then completed emotion recognition tasks known to be affected by frontotemporal dementia and by oxytocin. Caregivers completed validated behavioural ratings at 8 h and 1 week following drug administrations. A significant improvement in scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory was observed on the evening of oxytocin administration compared with placebo and compared with baseline ratings. Oxytocin was also associated with reduced recognition of angry facial expressions by patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Together these findings suggest that oxytocin is a potentially promising, novel symptomatic treatment candidate for patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and that further study of this neuropeptide in frontotemporal dementia is warranted.

Yet, mutations in TARDBP, the gene encoding these inclusions are associated with only 3% of sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent transgenic mouse studies have revealed a high degree of toxicity due to transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 proteins when overexpressed under the control of strong neuronal gene promoters, resulting in early paralysis and death, but without the presence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like ubiquitinated transactive response DNA-binding protein 43-positive inclusions. To better mimic human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we generated transgenic mice that exhibit moderate and ubiquitous expression of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 species using genomic fragments that encode wild-type human transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 or familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked mutant transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (G348C) and (A315T). These novel transgenic mice develop many age-related pathological and biochemical changes reminiscent of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis including ubiquitinated transactive response DNA-binding protein 43-positive inclusions, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 cleavage fragments, intermediate filament abnormalities, axonopathy and neuroinflammation. All three transgenic mouse models (wild-type, G348C and A315T) exhibited impaired learning and memory capabilities during ageing, as well as motor dysfunction. Real-time imaging with the use of biophotonic transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 transgenic mice carrying a glial fibrillary acidic protein-luciferase reporter revealed that the behavioural defects were preceded by induction of astrogliosis, a finding consistent with a role for reactive astrocytes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis. These novel transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 transgenic mice mimic several characteristics of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal lobar degeneration and they should provide valuable animal models for testing therapeutic approaches.

A randomized placebo-controlled trial of idebenone in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy	BRAIN			English	Article						LHON; idebenone; mitochondrial disease; mitochondrial encephalomyopathy; mitochondrial DNA; optic atrophy; optic neuropathy	COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; MUTATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CYBRIDS; PATIENT; DRIVEN	Major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of inherited metabolic disease caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations have yet to translate into treatments of proven efficacy. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is the most common mitochondrial DNA disorder causing irreversible blindness in young adult life. Anecdotal reports support the use of idebenone in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, but this has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. We conducted a 24-week multi-centre double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 85 patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy due to m.3460G > A, m.11778G > A, and m.14484T > C or mitochondrial DNA mutations. The active drug was idebenone 900 mg/day. The primary end-point was the best recovery in visual acuity. The main secondary end-point was the change in best visual acuity. Other secondary end-points were changes in visual acuity of the best eye at baseline and changes in visual acuity for both eyes in each patient. Colour-contrast sensitivity and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness were measured in subgroups. Idebenone was safe and well tolerated. The primary end-point did not reach statistical significance in the intention to treat population. However, post hoc interaction analysis showed a different response to idebenone in patients with discordant visual acuities at baseline; in these patients, all secondary end-points were significantly different between the idebenone and placebo groups. This first randomized controlled trial in the mitochondrial disorder, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, provides evidence that patients with discordant visual acuities are the most likely to benefit from idebenone treatment, which is safe and well tolerated.

Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITOR; ANTICONVULSANT USE; ADJUVANT TEMOZOLOMIDE; GLIOMA-CELLS; BRAIN-TUMORS; CHEMOTHERAPY; RADIOTHERAPY; CONCOMITANT; EXPRESSION; INCREASE	Objective: This analysis was performed to assess whether antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) modulate the effectiveness of temozolomide radiochemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Methods: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 26981-22981/National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) CE.3 clinical trial database of radiotherapy (RT) with or without temozolomide (TMZ) for newly diagnosed glioblastoma was examined to assess the impact of the interaction between AED use and chemoradiotherapy on survival. Data were adjusted for known prognostic factors. Results: When treatment began, 175 patients (30.5%) were AED-free, 277 (48.3%) were taking any enzyme-inducing AED (EIAED) and 135 (23.4%) were taking any non-EIAED. Patients receiving valproic acid (VPA) only had more grade 3/4 thrombopenia and leukopenia than patients without an AED or patients taking an EIAED only. The overall survival (OS) of patients who were receiving an AED at baseline vs not receiving any AED was similar. Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16.9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93). Conclusions: VPA may be preferred over an EIAED in patients with glioblastoma who require an AED during TMZ-based chemoradiotherapy. Future studies are needed to determine whether VPA increases TMZ bioavailability or acts as an inhibitor of histone deacetylases and thereby sensitizes for radiochemotherapy in vivo.

Previous work suggests that an elevated dopaminergic response to stress may index vulnerability to psychosis in certain individuals. With functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured stress-induced changes in brain activity in healthy individuals at elevated risk of developing psychosis. Participants were 15 controls and 25 psychometric schizotypes: 12 with positive symptom schizotypy (perceptual aberrations) and 13 with negative symptom schizotypy (physical anhedonia), as determined by questionnaires (Chapman et al., 1976; Chapman and Chapman, 1978). In the scanner, participants performed the Montreal Imaging Stress Task and a matched sensory-motor control task. Measures of self-reported stress and salivary cortisol levels were taken throughout the experiment. All three groups showed significant increases in self-reported stress and significant fMRI signal change in the striatal, limbic and cortical regions. However, the Physical Anhedonia group showed greater stress-induced striatal and limbic deactivation than the other two groups. Deactivation in the striatum was significantly correlated with Physical Anhedonia score across all subjects. Our findings suggest the presence of abnormalities in striatal response to stress in negative symptom schizotypy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TRPV1 acts as an important signal integrator in sensory nociceptors under physiological and pathological conditions including inflammation and neuropathy. Because of its integrative signaling properties in response to inflammatory stimuli, TRPV1 agonists and antagonists are predicted to inhibit the sensation of ongoing or burning pain that is reported by patients suffering from chronic pain, therefore offering an unprecedented advantage in selectively inhibiting painful signaling from where it is initiated. In this article, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of the role of TRPV1 in pain signaling, including an overview of clinical pharmacological trials using TRPV1 agonists and antagonists. Finally, we also present an update on the mechanistic understanding and controlling of hyperthermia caused by TRPV1 antagonists, and provide perspectives for future studies.

Although the downstream targets of superoxide are unknown, chemical reduction of oxidized sulfhydryls has been shown to be neuroprotective for injured RGCs. On the basis of this, we developed novel phosphine-borane complex compounds that are cell permeable and highly stable. Here, we report that our lead compound, bis (3-propionic acid methyl ester) phenylphosphine borane complex 1 (PB1) promotes RGC survival in rat models of optic nerve axotomy and in experimental glaucoma. PB1-mediated RGC neuroprotection did not correlate with inhibition of stress-activated protein kinase signaling, including apoptosis stimulating kinase 1 (ASK1), c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) or p38. Instead, PB1 led to a striking increase in retinal BDNF levels and downstream activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 entirely blocked RGC neuroprotection induced by PB1. We conclude that PB1 protects damaged RGCs through activation of pro-survival signals. These data support a potential cross-talk between redox homeostasis and neurotrophin-related pathways leading to RGC survival after axonal injury.

J	Fiori, LM; Turecki, G				Fiori, Laura M.; Turecki, Gustavo			Epigenetic regulation of spermidine/spermine N-1-acetyltransferase (SAT1) in Suicide	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Polyamines; SAT1; Epigenetics; Gene expression; Suicide	GENE-EXPRESSION; DNA METHYLATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; HISTONE METHYLATION; POSTMORTEM BRAIN; FRONTAL-CORTEX; CANCER CELLS; COLON-CANCER; COMPLETERS	We have recently shown that the expression of spermidine/spermine N-1-acetyltransferase (SAT1) is downregulated across the brains of suicide completers, and that its expression is influenced by genetic variations in the promoter. Several promoter polymorphisms in SAT1, including rs6526342, have been associated with suicide and other psychiatric disorders, and display haplotype-specific effects on expression. However, these effects cannot explain total variability in SAT1 expression, and other regulatory mechanisms, such as epigenetic factors, may also be at play. In this study, we assessed the involvement of epigenetic factors in controlling SAT1 expression in the prefrontal cortex of suicide completers by mapping CpG methylation across a 1880-bp region of the SAT1 promoter, and measuring levels of tri-methylated histone-3-lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at the promoter in suicide completers and controls. Our results demonstrated that CpG methylation was significantly negatively correlated with SAT1 expression. Although overall or site-specific CpG methylation was not associated with suicide or SAT1 expression, we observed high levels of methylation at the polymorphic CpG site created by rs6526342, indicating a relationship between promoter haplotypes and methylation. There was no association between H3K27me3 and suicide, nor was this modification associated with SAT1 expression. Overall, our results indicate that epigenetic factors in the promoter region of SAT1 influence gene expression levels, and may provide a mechanism for both our previous findings of haplotype-specific effects of promoter variations on SAT1 expression, as well as the widespread downregulation of SAT1 expression observed in the brains of suicide completers.

The goal of my research is to gain insight into the nature of the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying the selective plasticity of mesocorticolimbic DA neurons. Here, I review work showing that the guidance cue netrin-1 is implicated in the organization, plasticity and function of mesocorticolimbic DA neurons in rodents. Developmental variations in netrin-1 receptor function result in selective reorganization of medial prefrontal DA circuitry during adolescence and in an adult phenotype protected against schizophrenia-like dopaminergic and behavioural abnormalities. Furthermore, in adulthood, expression of netrin-1 receptors is upregulated by repeated exposure to stimulant drugs of abuse in DA somatodendritic regions and is necessary for drug-induced behavioural plasticity. I propose that risk factors associated with DA-related adult psychiatric disorders alter netrin-1 function.

Here we present a two-dimensional microfluidic quadrupole and a theoretical analysis consistent with the experimental observations. The microfluidic quadrupole was formed by simultaneously injecting and aspirating fluids from two pairs of opposing apertures in a narrow gap formed between a microfluidic probe and a substrate. A stagnation point was formed at the centre of the microfluidic quadrupole, and its position could be rapidly adjusted hydrodynamically. Following the injection of a solute through one of the poles, a stationary, tunable, and movable-that is, 'floating'-concentration gradient was formed at the stagnation point. Our results lay the foundation for future combined experimental and theoretical exploration of microfluidic planar multipoles including convective-diffusive phenomena.

To achieve a compromise between the nonrigid registration accuracy and the associated computational cost, we implement a three-level hierarchical multiresolution approach such that the image resolution is increased in a coarse to fine fashion. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the registration accuracy of our approach. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated on a 3-D magnetic resonance data volume and also on clinically acquired 4-D CT image datasets.

Cholecalciferol Plus Calcium Suppresses Abnormal PBMC Reactivity in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Article							VITAMIN-D SUPPLEMENTATION; RESONANCE-IMAGING LESIONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; T-CELLS; 1,25-DIHYDROXYVITAMIN D-3; RELAPSE RATE; SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS; 25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D; PATIENTS TARGET; D DEFICIENCY	Context: The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D], is a potent modulator of immune cells in vitro. Objective: Our objective was to determine whether the sun-dependent nutrient, cholecalciferol, can alter disease-associated cellular immune abnormalities in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: This was an open-label, 12-month, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Patients with MS were recruited from the MS Clinic at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto. Patients: Forty-nine patients were matched(for age, sex, disease duration, disease-modifying drug, and disability) and enrolled (treated n = 25; control n = 24). Four patients were lost to follow-up (n = 2 from each group). Intervention: Treated patients received increasing doses of cholecalciferol (4,000-40,000 IU/d) plus calcium (1200 mg/d), followed by equilibration to a moderate, physiological intake (10,000 IU/d). Control patients did not receive supplements. Main Outcome Measures: At enrollment and at 12 months, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferative responses to disease-associated, MS-relevant, and control antigens were measured, along with selected serum biochemical markers. Results: At 12 months, mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were 83 +/- 35 nmol/liter and 179 +/- 76 nmol/liter in control and treated participants, respectively (paired t, P < 0.001). Serum 1,25(OH)(2)D did not differ between baseline and 1 yr. In treated patients, 12-month PBMC proliferative responses to neuron antigens myelin basic protein and exon-2 were suppressed (P = 0.002). In controls, there were no significant changes in disease-associated PBMC responsiveness. There were no significant differences between groups in levels of selected biomarkers. Interpretation: MS-associated, abnormal T cell reactivities were suppressed in vivo by cholecalciferol at serum 25(OH) D concentrations higher than 100 nmol/liter.

Evidence for the use of rotational optic flow cues for locomotor steering in healthy older adults. J Neurophysiol 106: 1089-1096, 2011. First published June 8, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00277.2011.-Optic flow is a powerful visual cue for the control of locomotion. Considerable research has focused on how healthy young people use and perceive optic flow. However, little is known on how older adults use this type of visual motion to control walking. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of young and older adults to adjust their physical walking trajectory in response to a rotation of the optic flow presented in a virtual environment. Ten healthy young adults (mean age 23.49 +/- 4.72 yr) and 10 healthy older adults (mean age 76.22 +/- 3.11 yr) participated in the study. Subjects were instructed to walk straight in a virtual environment viewed within a head-mounted display unit as they walked overground for 5 m, while the focus of expansion was gradually rotated to the left or the right by 40. All subjects responded with a similar strategy by rotating their head and body in the direction away from the orientation of the perturbation. The younger subjects achieved almost complete corrections and had very small net heading errors. In contrast, the older adults had delayed and smaller reorientations, particularly in the head, thus showing significantly larger heading errors compared with younger subjects. We conclude that older adults retain the ability to use optic flow to control their walking trajectory, although smaller, delayed head rotations and larger heading errors may indicate an age-dependent effect on sensorimotor coordination.

Here we investigated whether activation of cholinergic receptors, which can modulate synaptic plasticity, also mediates changes in dendritic spine structure. Using confocal time-lapse microscopy in mouse slice cultures we found that brief activation of muscarinic receptors induced the emergence of fine filopodia from spine heads in all CA1 pyramidal cells examined. This response was widespread occurring in 48% of imaged spines, appeared within minutes, was reversible, and was blocked by atropine. Electron microscopic analyses showed that the spine head filopodia (SHFs) extend along the presynaptic bouton. In addition, the decay time of miniature EPSCs was longer after application of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist methacholine (MCh). Both morphological and electrophysiological changes were reduced by preventing microtubule polymerization with nocodazole. This extension of SHFs during cholinergic receptor activation represents a novel structural form of subspine plasticity that may regulate synaptic properties by fine-tuning interactions between presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines.

Methods-On the basis of previous anatomic descriptions, high-resolution musculoskeletal sonography was used in an attempt to identify the distal posterior interosseous nerve in the wrists of 20 unembalmed cadaveric specimens (11 male and 9 female; ages 54-98 years). High-frequency scanning (17-5 MHz) of the fourth dorsal extensor compartment revealed a small (1-3 mm) hypoechoic structure located on the compartment floor, presumed to represent the posterior interosseous nerve. Electronic calipers measured the distance between Lister's tubercle and this structure, as well as the structure's radial-ulnar width and volar-dorsal height. The presumed posterior interosseous nerves of 10 specimens were then injected with diluted colored latex using sonographic guidance. Subsequent dissection definitively identified the sonographically visualized and injected structure. Results-Dissection revealed latex within the posterior interosseous nerve in all 10 injected specimens, thus confirming that the sonographically visualized structure represented the distal posterior interosseous nerve. The nerve was identified sonographically in all 20 examined specimens, was located an average of 4.88 mm (range, 2.10-10.0 mm) ulnar to Lister's tubercle, and had an average width and height of 2.35 mm (range, 1.20-3.50 mm) and 1.01 mm (range, 0.80-1.40 mm), respectively. Conclusions-High-resolution sonography can reliably identify the distal posterior interosseous nerve within the fourth dorsal extensor compartment. Clinicians should consider formal evaluation of the posterior interosseous nerve in patients presenting with dorsal wrist pain syndromes. Future investigations should explore the potential role of sonographically guided percutaneous procedures directed at the posterior interosseous nerve.

Minimum Effective Volume of Lidocaine for Ultrasound-Guided Supraclavicular Block	REGIONAL ANESTHESIA AND PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article							BRACHIAL-PLEXUS BLOCK; EFFECTIVE ANESTHETIC VOLUME; REGIONAL ANESTHESIA; DOUBLE-INJECTION; NERVE BLOCK; GUIDANCE; DESIGN	Background: The aim of this study was to determine the minimum effective volume of lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL in 90% of patients (MEV90) for double-injection ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block (SCB). Methods: Using an in-plane technique and a lateral to medial direction, a double-injection ultrasound-guided SCB was performed. A 17-gauge, 8-cm Tuohy needle was initially advanced until its tip was positioned at the intersection of the first rib and subclavian artery ("corner pocket"). Half the volume of lidocaine was injected in this location. Subsequently, the needle was redirected toward the neural cluster formed by the trunks and divisions of the brachial plexus. The remaining volume of lidocaine was deposited in this location. Volume assignment was carried out using a biased coin design up-and-down sequential method, where the total volume of local anesthetic administered to each patient depended on the response of the previous one. In case of failure, the next subject received a higher volume (defined as the previous volume with an increment of 2.5 mL). If the previous patient had a successful block, the next subject was randomized to a lower volume (defined as the previous volume with a decrement of 2.5 mL), with a probability of b = 0.11, or the same volume, with a probability of 1 - b = 0.89. Each increment or decrement was evenly distributed between the "corner pocket" (1.25 mL) and neural cluster (1.25 mL). Lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL was used in all subjects. Success was defined, at 30 minutes, as a minimal score of 14 of 16 points using a composite scale encompassing sensory and motor block. Patients undergoing surgery of the elbow, forearm, wrist, or hand were prospectively enrolled until 45 successful blocks were obtained. Results: Fifty-four patients were included in the study. Using isotonic regression and bootstrap confidence interval, the MEV90 for double-injection ultrasound-guided SCB was estimated to be 32 mL (95% confidence interval, 30-34 mL). All patients with a minimal composite score of 14 points at 30 minutes achieved surgical anesthesia intraoperatively. Conclusions: For double-injection ultrasound-guided SCB, the MEV90 of lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL is 32 mL. Further dose finding studies are required for other concentrations of lidocaine, other local anesthetic agents and single-injection techniques.	[Tran, De Q.

Cache Cty Investigators	Early Parental Death and Remarriage of Widowed Parents as Risk Factors for Alzheimer Disease: The Cache County Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						psychosocial stress; Alzheimer's disease; parental death; parental remarriage	STRESS; DEPRESSION; DEMENTIA; CHILDHOOD; CORTISOL; BRAIN; ADAPTATION; MEMORY; ADULTS; AGE	Objectives: Early parental death is associated with lifelong tendencies toward depression and chronic stress. We tested the hypothesis that early parental death is associated with higher risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) in offspring. Design: A population-based epidemiological study of dementia with detailed clinical evaluations, linked to one of the world's richest sources of objective genealogical and vital statistics data. Setting: Home visits with residents of a rural county in northern Utah. Participants: 4,108 subjects, aged 65-105. Measurements: Multistage dementia ascertainment protocol implemented in four triennial waves, yielding expert consensus diagnoses of 570 participants with AD and 3,538 without dementia. Parental death dates, socioeconomic status, and parental remarriage after widowhood were obtained from the Utah Population Database, a large genealogical database linked to statewide birth and death records. Results: Mother's death during subject's adolescence was significantly associated with higher rate of AD in regression models that included age, gender, education, APOE genotype, and socioeconomic status. Father's death before subject age 5 showed a weaker association. In stratified analyses, associations were significant only when the widowed parent did not remarry. Parental death associations were not moderated by gender or APOE genotype. Findings were specific to AD and not found for non-AD dementia. Conclusions: Parental death during childhood is associated with higher prevalence of AD, with different critical periods for father's versus mother's death, with strength of these associations attenuated by remarriage of the widowed parent.

Changes in Cortical Thickness During the Course of Illness in Schizophrenia	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							1ST EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN VOLUMES; ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; CHRONIC EXPOSURE; MACAQUE MONKEYS; CHILDHOOD-ONSET	Context: Whether cortical thickness changes in schizophrenia over time are more pronounced relative to the changes that can be attributed to normal aging has not been studied. Objective: To compare patients with schizophrenia and healthy control participants on cortical thickness change. Design: A 5-year longitudinal study comparing schizophrenic patients and healthy controls using 2 magnetic resonance images of the brain. Setting: Patients were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry at the University Medical Centre Utrecht and from other psychiatric hospitals in the Netherlands. Healthy controls were recruited via advertisement in newspapers and notice boards. Participants: Ninety-six schizophrenic patients and 113 healthy controls aged 16 to 56 years. Main Outcome Measures: Cortical thickness and change in cortical thickness on a vertex-by-vertex basis across the cortical mantle, measures of functional and symptomatic outcome, and cumulative intake of antipsychotics during the scan interval. Results: At baseline, the schizophrenic patients had thinner left orbitofrontal and right parahippocampal and superior temporal cortices and a thicker superior parietal lobule and occipital pole compared with the controls. Mean cortical thickness did not differ between the groups. Over time, excessive cortical thinning was found in widespread areas on the cortical mantle, most pronounced bilaterally in the temporal cortex and in the left frontal area. Poor outcome in patients was associated with more pronounced cortical thinning. Higher cumulative intake of typical antipsychotics during the scan interval was associated with more pronounced cortical thinning, whereas higher cumulative intake of atypical antipsychotic medication was associated with less pronounced cortical thinning. Conclusions: In schizophrenia, the cortex shows excessive thinning over time in widespread areas of the brain, most pronounced in the frontal and temporal areas, and progresses across the entire course of the illness. The excessive thinning of the cortex appears related to outcome and medication intake.	[van Haren, Neeltje E. M.; Schnack, Hugo G.; Cahn, Wiepke; van den Heuvel, Martijn P.; Pol, Hilleke E.

Design: Sixteen university athletes participated in the study: eight had one or more sport-related concussions, and eight never experienced a concussion. The Frequency Pattern Sequence test, the Duration Pattern Sequence test, the Synthetic Sentence Identification test, and the Staggered Spondaic Word test were used to assess auditory processing. Results: All nonconcussed athletes have normal auditory processing. In contrast, more than half of the concussed athletes had deficits for one or more of the auditory processing tests. Conclusions: The pattern of results suggests that sport-related concussions can disrupt the neurological mechanisms implicated in several auditory processes, including monaural low-redundancy speech recognition, tone pattern recognition, and dichotic listening.

Computerized testing augments pencil-and-paper tasks in measuring HIV-associated mild cognitive impairment	HIV MEDICINE			English	Article						executive function; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder; Rasch analysis; test development	MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OLDER-ADULTS; DEMENTIA; HIV/AIDS; PERFORMANCE; INFECTION; INDIVIDUALS; PREVALENCE	Background Existing tools for rapid cognitive assessment in HIV-positive individuals with mild cognitive deficits lack sensitivity or do not meet psychometric requirements for tracking changes in cognitive ability over time. Methods Seventy-five nondemented HIV-positive patients were evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a brief battery of standardized neuropsychological tests, and computerized tasks evaluating frontal-executive function and processing speed. Rasch analyses were applied to the MoCA data set and subsequently to the full set of data from all tests. Results The MoCA was found to adequately measure cognitive ability as a single, global construct in this HIV-positive cohort, although it showed poorer precision for measuring patients of higher ability. Combining the additional tests with the MoCA resulted in a battery with better psychometric properties that also better targeted the range of abilities in this cohort. Conclusion This application of modern test development techniques shows a path towards a quick, quantitative, global approach to cognitive assessment with promise both for initial detection and for longitudinal follow-up of cognitive impairment in patients with HIV infection.

Fourteen out of 18 family members were personally examined and 11 of them were scanned with computed tomography (CT). CT scans revealed existence of symmetrical calcifications in six family members from three generations (four symptomatic and two asymptomatic). Age at onset of clinical symptoms varied between 22.0 and 55.4 years. The main clinical findings included parkinsonism, severe gait disturbances with freezing of gait, and dyskinesia. Hyperechogenicities identified by transcranial sonography corresponded well to the CT images of hyperintense calcifications in the same structures, whereas brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated predominant hypoperfusion in the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia. After exclusion of linkage to known loci, our pedigree with IBGC further demonstrates locus heterogeneity in this disorder. Analysis of clinically affected individuals supports observation that the clinical features of IBGC appear to be varied both within and between families. The age at onset of the clinical symptoms appeared to be decreasing in two observed transmissions, suggestive of possible genetic anticipation.

Deposition of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is limited in forebrain of young obese fa/fa Zucker rats fed a diet high in alpha-linolenic acid but devoid of DHA	JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Hyperinsulinemia; Forebrain; DHA; alpha-linolenic acid; Young Zucker rats	POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS; ESTIMATED DESATURASE ACTIVITIES; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; BRAIN PHOSPHOLIPIDS; DELTA-5 DESATURASE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; COGNITIVE DECLINE; LIPID-COMPOSITION; GENE-EXPRESSION; ADIPOSE-TISSUE	Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is required for neurotransmitter synthesis and learning. Conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to DHA is considered adequate to support brain function in youth, but it is unknown if brain DHA can be maintained in insulin resistant states. This study investigated brain fatty acid and desaturase activities in young insulin resistant Zucker rats on diets with and without DHA. Male fa/fa and lean rats were fed diets enriched with flaxseed (FXO. ALA: 35.5% fatty acids), menhaden (MO. DHA: 9.2%) or safflower oil (SO, linoleic acid: 54.1%) for 9 weeks, n=8 per diet per genotype. Compared to lean, the 15 week old fa/fa rats were obese (56% heavier) and insulin-resistant (>18-fold in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance). The forebrain of fa/fa rats had higher palmitoleic (16:1n-7) and dihomo-gamma-linolenic (20:3n-6) acids, and higher Delta 9, Delta 6 but lower Delta 5 (all P <=.006) desaturase indices than lean. The Delta 9 and Delta 6 desaturase indices positively, while the Delta 5 negatively (all P <=.01) correlated with insulin resistance. The Delta 9 desaturase index positively correlated with adiposity index. The percentage of forebrain DHA of fa/fa rats was lower (P=.011) than lean rats when fed FXO diet while there was no difference (P>.05) between fa/fa and lean rats fed MO or SO diet. Thus, the alterations in the fatty acid and desaturase indices in the brain were consistent inhibited forebrain synthesis of DHA in the fa/fa rats. ALA may not have potential to effectively serve as a precursor for synthesizing DHA for youth forebrain during insulin resistance since Delta 5 desaturase activity is limited.

A 26-year-old male presented with progressive myoclonus epilepsy and declining mental status. He had failed in university studies because of impaired attention, memory and concentration. Generalized seizures started to occur approximately once a month, and he developed myoclonus and progressive gait disturbances. Neuroimaging revealed mild atrophy and multiple periventricular white matter lesions, consistent with demyelination. He progressively declined and died at age 34. Neuropathologic examination revealed widespread involvement of the cerebral cortex by numerous round eosinophilic inclusions in neuronal perikarya and neuropil, predominantly within the deep cortical layers. Numerous inclusions were also found in the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, brain stem, spinal gray matter, and dorsal root ganglia. They were essentially absent from the cerebellum. The inclusions were immunopositive for antibodies raised against neuroserpin. The white matter lesions showed histologic features compatible with multiple sclerosis. Genetic analysis revealed a nucleotide substitution in codon 47 in one allele of the PI12 gene, resulting in a proline for leucine amino acid substitution (L47P). In summary, we report a case of neuroserpin encephalopathy associated with a novel PI12 mutation and complicated by coexistent multiple sclerosis.

It also sought to determine whether sex differences in the EEG power spectra reflect differential patterns of maturation. A group of 56 adolescents were tested at age 10 years and then at two further time-points approximately 18 months apart. The EEG was recorded during both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions and Fourier transformed to provide estimates of absolute and relative spectral power at 0.5 Hz intervals from 0.5 to 40 Hz. The peak alpha frequency for each individual at each time-point was also determined for relative spectral power. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was used to determine the combination of electrodes and frequencies that showed developmental change, or differed between the sexes. As a function of age, absolute delta and theta frequencies power decreased, and relative alpha2 and beta frequencies increased, replicating the standard findings of a decrease in lower, and increase in higher, frequencies with age. A small but significant increase in peak alpha frequency with age was detected. Moreover PLS analysis performed with individual alpha frequencies aligned to 10 Hz suggested that the age-related increase seen in alpha2 relative power was driven by changes in the peak frequency. Although males demonstrated higher alpha power than females, there were no sex differences in peak frequency, suggesting that there may be more to sex differences in EEG power than simply different rates of maturation between the two sexes.

Computed Basis Functions for Finite Element Analysis Based on Tomographic Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bioelectromagnetism; computational modeling; electroencephalography; electrostatics; finite element method (FEM); MRI	MESH GENERATION; HUMAN SKULL; HEAD MODEL; EEG; RECORDINGS; SIMULATION	In bioelectromagnetics, the structures in which the electromagnetic field is to be computed are sometimes defined by a fine grid of voxels (3-D cells) whose tissue types are obtained by tomography. A novel finite element method is proposed for such cases. A simple, regular mesh of cube elements is constructed, each containing the same, integer number of voxels. There may be several different tissues present within an element, but this is accommodated by computing element basis functions that approximately respect the interface conditions between different tissues. Results are presented for a test model of 128(3) voxels, consisting of nested dielectric cubes, driven by specified charges. The electrostatic potential computed with the new method agrees well with that of a conventional finite element code: the rms difference along the sample line is 1.5% of the highest voltage. Results are also presented for the potential due to a current dipole placed in a brain model of 181 x 217 x 181 voxels, derived from MRI data. The new method gives potentials that are different to those obtained by treating each voxel as an element by 1% of the peak voltage, yet the global finite element matrix has a dimension which is more than 50 times smaller.

Binocular Balance in Normal Vision and Its Modulation by Mean Luminance	OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE			English	Article						eye dominance; binocular balance; mean luminance	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; OCULAR DOMINANCE; PATIENT SATISFACTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; MONOVISION; CAT; CONTRAST; AMBLYOPIA; NEURONS; EYE	Purpose. To better understand the neural basis of sensory dominance in the normal population, we applied a recently established test designed to quantify the degree of suppression in amblyopia to participants with normal binocular vision. Methods. This test quantifies the degree of dichoptic imbalance in coherent motion sensitivity by manipulating the contrast of stimuli seen by the two eyes. The contrast at which balanced dichoptic motion sensitivity occurs is referred to as the "balance point" and is an estimate of the degree of suppression. We apply the same logic to the measurement of sensory dominance by measuring the distribution of "balance points" within the normal population. Results. We show that although most subjects are balanced or only weakly imbalanced, a minority is strongly imbalanced. To ascertain the site of sensory dominance, we assessed the degree to which normal sensory balance can be modulated by changing the interocular mean luminance. We found that mismatches in mean luminance between the two eyes had a pronounced effect on the balance point determination. Conclusions. Because cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus exhibit a strong modulation to sustained changes in the mean light level, this may suggests that the inhibitory circuits underlying sensory eye dominance are located at a precortical site.

Women also show greater overall anxiety sensitivity than men. Given these differences, we hypothesized that sex differences in anxiety would explain sex differences in experienced pain and physiological responses to pain (at both spinal and cortical levels). By measuring subjective pain, state/trait anxiety, nociceptive flexion reflexes, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), it was possible to test the effects of anxiety on the processing of painful drives at different levels of the neuraxis while also documenting the role played by anxiety on sex differences in experienced pain. Results confirm that women are indeed more sensitive to pain than men. Importantly, this difference was accompanied by a significant sex difference in cortical activity (SEP amplitude) but not spinal nociceptive activity, suggesting that much of the sex difference in experienced pain is attributable to variations in thalamocortical processing and to ensuing changes in the appraisal of and/or emotional response to noxious insult. In support of this claim, we found that sex differences in cortical activity and subjective pain disappeared when trait anxiety was controlled for. This means that stable predispositions to respond with heightened apprehension contribute to baseline pain sensitivity differences between the sexes. These results indicate that the modulatory effect of affect on pain-related brain processes may explain why men and women experience painful shocks so differently. In our study, the mediating role of anxiety on sex differences in pain was tested and confirmed using path analysis. (C) 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Neurovascular coupling is so precise that it underlies neuroimaging techniques to map changes in neuronal activity. Therefore, understanding its basis is indispensable for the proper interpretation of imaging signals from functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, routinely used in humans. Although neurovascular coupling mechanisms are not yet fully understood, considerable progress has been made over the last decade. In this review, we present recent knowledge from in vivo studies on the cortical cellular network involved in neurovascular coupling responses and the mediators implicated in these haemodynamic changes. Recent findings have emphasized the intricate interplay between both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in neurovascular coupling, together with an intermediary role of astrocytes, which are ideally positioned between neurons and microvessels. Finally, we describe latest findings on the alterations of neurovascular function encountered in neuro-degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

During the preschool period, maturation of the prefrontostriatal circuitry parallels increases in inhibitory control (IC). Poor IC development could result in elevated levels of aggressive, disruptive, and impulsive behavior. In this investigation, the development of the relation between IC and EP was examined in preschool and early elementary school children using the Day/Night and Tapping tasks. Children with more EP made more incorrect responses on both IC tasks, consistently across age and sex. The associations between EP and response latencies differed across children, however, with longer latencies on the Tapping task being most characteristic for boys with high levels of EP. This association was not apparent for girls. Two prominent aspects of early EP, aggressive and inattentive behavior, showed only weak unique associations with IC performance. These findings imply that diminished IC accompanies elevated EP as early as the preschool years, and that this decrement persists into the elementary school-age years for both girls and boys, and that accuracy and response latency may confer different information about the development of IC.

After its activation, via DNA damage, oxidative stress, or aberrant expression of oncogenes, p53 transduces its classical effect through several mechanisms comprising activation of the DNA repair machinery, cell cycle arrest, and initiation of apoptosis or senescence. In the mammalian brain, p53 plays critical functions in normal development, tumor suppression, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging. Herein, we focus on the constitutive pro-oxidant activity of p53 in neurons and discuss the potential implication of this finding in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and normal brain aging.

BRAIN INJURY			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; corpus callosum; children; magnetic resonance imaging; shape	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; HEAD-INJURY; CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD; SHAPE; SIZE; REDUCTION; ADULTHOOD; FEATURES	Aim: The corpus callosum (CC) can be affected by childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI), through focal lesions, reductions in size and arrested development. Little is known, however, about what constitutes normal CC shape and appearance and how it may be affected in the long-term after early TBI. Methods: In this study, the appearance of the CC was investigated in individuals with TBI assessed 10 years post-injury (n = 52, mean age = 16.82 years, SD = 3.55 years, 24 male) and compared to age-matched healthy controls (n = 44, mean age = 15.77 years, SD = 1.21 years, 18 male). A simple visual analysis technique was used to code the appearance of the CC according to location of focal thinning and severity of thinning and results between groups were compared using Chi-square analysis. Results: A significantly higher proportion of patients with childhood TBI had focal posterior thinning of the CC than age-matched controls (p = 0.001). Conclusions: The findings call into question previous conclusions that focal posterior thinning is a normal variant of development. Instead, attenuations of the posterior portion of the CC in the long-term may reflect altered cortical and callosal development as a result of early brain injury, although the functional significance of this remains to be determined.

Here we use high-field MRI (7T) to assess the quantitative MRI properties of the CST at the PLIC level in 22 healthy young male participants. We used three different imaging modalities: the T (1) and T (2) relaxation times (T (1) and T (2)) and the Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR). These measurements obtained in the CST were compared with those in the anterior two-thirds of the PLIC. We observed longer T (1) and T (2) and lower MTR in the CST region compared with the adjacent (control) PLIC region. This effect is consistent with the presence of sparsely distributed, large-diameter fibres described in previous histological studies and, as such, might reflect lower myelin density and/or different morphology of fibres in the CST.

As morphometric studies have shown widespread structural damage in TLE, this condition is often referred to as a system disorder with disrupted structural networks. Studies based on univariate statistical comparisons can only indirectly test such hypothesis. Graph theory provides a new approach to formally analyze large-scale networks. Using graph-theoretical analysis of magnetic resonance imaging-based cortical thickness correlations, we investigated the structural basis of the organization of such networks in 122 TLE patients and 47 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Networks in patients and controls were characterized by a short path length between anatomical regions and a high degree of clustering, suggestive of a small-world topology. However, compared with controls, patients showed increased path length and clustering, altered distribution of network hubs, and higher vulnerability to targeted attacks, suggesting a reorganization of cortical thickness correlation networks. Longitudinal analysis demonstrated that network alterations intensify over time. Bootstrap simulations showed high reproducibility of network parameters across random subsamplings, indicating that altered network topology in TLE is a consistent finding. Increased network disruption was associated with unfavorable postoperative seizure outcome, implying adverse effects of epileptogenesis on large-scale network organization.

Little is however known about the antecedents of computer self-efficacy. This paper reports on a study of 143 non-users of a self-checkout library system available at a large Canadian university which was conducted to investigate the relationships between stable personality traits and gender with computer self-efficacy. Results indicate that four of the five stable personality traits, as measured by the Big-5 factors of personality, contribute to explain computer self-efficacy. Taking gender into account, results show that the traits of neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness are significantly related to computer self-efficacy for women but not for men. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Relevant literature was reviewed. Recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Conclusions and Recommendations: 1) Determination of brain death in term newborns, infants, and children is a clinical diagnosis based on the absence of neurologic function with a known irreversible cause of coma. Because of insufficient data in the literature, recommendations for preterm infants <37 wks gestational age are not included in this guideline. 2) Hypotension, hypothermia, and metabolic disturbances should be treated and corrected and medications that can interfere with the neurologic examination and apnea testing should be discontinued allowing for adequate clearance before proceeding with these evaluations. 3) Two examinations, including apnea testing with each examination separated by an observation period, are required. Examinations should be performed by different attending physicians. Apnea testing may be performed by the same physician. An observation period of 24 hrs for term newborns (37 wks gestational age) to 30 days of age and 12 hrs for infants and children (>30 days to 18 yrs) is recommended. The first examination determines the child has met the accepted neurologic examination criteria for brain death. The second examination confirms brain death based on an unchanged and irreversible condition. Assessment of neurologic function after cardiopulmonary resuscitation or other severe acute brain injuries should be deferred for >= 24 hrs if there are concerns or inconsistencies in the examination. 4) Apnea testing to support the diagnosis of brain death must be performed safely and requires documentation of an arterial PaCO2 20 mm Hg above the baseline and >= 60 mm Hg with no respiratory effort during the testing period. If the apnea test cannot be safely completed, an ancillary study should be performed. 5) Ancillary studies (electroencephalogram and radionuclide cerebral blood flow) are not required to establish brain death and are not a substitute for the neurologic examination. Ancillary studies may be used to assist the clinician in making the diagnosis of brain death a) when components of the examination or apnea testing cannot be completed safely as a result of the underlying medical condition of the patient; b) if there is uncertainty about the results of the neurologic examination; c) if a medication effect may be present; or d) to reduce the interexamination observation period. When ancillary studies are used, a second clinical examination and apnea test should be performed and components that can be completed must remain consistent with brain death. In this instance, the observation interval may be shortened and the second neurologic examination and apnea test (or all components that are able to be completed safely) can be performed at any time thereafter. 6) Death is declared when these criteria are fulfilled.

Persistent high levels of PGE2 likely exert chronic effects on nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that injured nerve-derived PGE2 contributes to the up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in DRG neurons following partial sciatic nerve ligation. In naive adult rats, IL-6 was expressed in only a few small size DRG neurons which all co-expressed EP4 receptors. Partial sciatic nerve ligation increased and shifted IL-6 expression from small to medium and large size damaged DRG neurons. Perineural injection of a selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor or a selective EP4 receptor antagonist significantly suppressed the up-regulation of IL-6 in DRG, suggesting that injured nerve derived PGE2 contributes to the de novo synthesis of IL-6 in DRG neurons through EP4 receptors. In cultured sensory ganglion explants, a stabilized PGE2 analog increased IL-6 mRNA and protein levels through the activation of EP4, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, extracelluar regulated protein kinase/MAPK, cAMP response element binding protein and NF kappa B signalling pathways. Taken together, these data indicate that facilitating the de novo synthesis of pain-related cytokines in injured medium and large size DRG neurons is a novel mechanism underlying the role of injured nerve derived PGE2 in the genesis of neuropathic pain.

A method is presented for selection of an optimum experimental design for quantitative magnetization transfer imaging based on the iterative reduction of a discrete sampling of the Z-spectrum. The applicability of the technique is demonstrated for human brain white matter imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T, and optimal designs are produced to target specific model parameters. The optimal number of measurements and the signal-to-noise ratio required for stable parameter estimation are also investigated. In vivo imaging results demonstrate that this optimal design approach substantially improves parameter map quality. The iterative method presented here provides an advantage over free form optimal design methods, in that pragmatic design constraints are readily incorporated. In particular, the presented method avoids clustering and repeated measures in the final experimental design, an attractive feature for the purpose of magnetization transfer model validation. The iterative optimal design technique is general and can be applied to any method of quantitative magnetization transfer imaging. Magn Reson Med 66:635-643, 2011. (C)2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We asked whether selective TrkA activation may have a different impact on learning, short-term memory, and long-term memory. We also asked whether TrkA activation might affect cognition differently in wild-type mice versus mice with cognitive deficits due to transgenic overexpression of mutant amyloid-precursor protein (APP mice). Mice were treated with wild-type NGF (a ligand of TrkA and p75(NTR)) or with selective pharmacological agonists of TrkA that do not bind to p75(NTR). In APP mice, the selective TrkA agonists significantly improved learning and short-term memory. These improvements are associated with a reduction of soluble A beta levels in the cortex and AKT activation in the cortex and hippocampus. However, this improved phenotype did not translate into improved long-term memory. In normal wild-type mice, none of the treatments affected learning or short-term memory, but a TrkA-selective agonist caused persistent deficits in long-term memory. The deficit in wild-type mice was associated temporally, in the hippocampus, with increased AKT activity, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor precursor, increased neurotrophin receptor homolog-2 (p75-related protein), and long-term depression. Together, these data indicate that selective TrkA activation affects cognition but does so differently in impaired APP mice versus normal wild-type mice. Understanding mechanisms that govern learning and memory is important for better treatment of cognitive disorders.	[Aboulkassim, Tahar; Brahimi, Fouad; Saragovi, H.

Risk of brain tumours in relation to estimated RF dose from mobile phones: results from five Interphone countries	OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							CELLULAR-TELEPHONE USE; CORDLESS TELEPHONES; POOLED ANALYSIS; CANCER; POPULATION; MENINGIOMA; GLIOMA; COHORT; USERS	Objectives The objective of this study was to examine the associations of brain tumours with radio frequency (RF) fields from mobile phones. Methods Patients with brain tumour from the Australian, Canadian, French, Israeli and New Zealand components of the Interphone Study, whose tumours were localised by neuroradiologists, were analysed. Controls were matched on age, sex and region and allocated the 'tumour location' of their matched case. Analyses included 553 glioma and 676 meningioma cases and 1762 and 1911 controls, respectively. RF dose was estimated as total cumulative specific energy (TCSE; J/kg) absorbed at the tumour's estimated centre taking into account multiple RF exposure determinants. Results ORs with ever having been a regular mobile phone user were 0.93 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.18) for glioma and 0.80 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.96) for meningioma. ORs for glioma were below 1 in the first four quintiles of TCSE but above 1 in the highest quintile, 1.35 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.90). The OR increased with increasing TCSE 7+ years before diagnosis (p-trend 0.01; OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.47 in the highest quintile). A complementary analysis in which 44 glioma and 135 meningioma cases in the most exposed area of the brain were compared with gliomas and meningiomas located elsewhere in the brain showed increased ORs for tumours in the most exposed part of the brain in those with 10+ years of mobile phone use (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.13 to 6.94 for glioma). Patterns for meningioma were similar, but ORs were lower, many below 1.0. Conclusions There were suggestions of an increased risk of glioma in long-term mobile phone users with high RF exposure and of similar, but apparently much smaller, increases in meningioma risk. The uncertainty of these results requires that they be replicated before a causal interpretation can be made.

However, the effects of stress may vary depending on the point or points along the developmental trajectory when adversity strikes. Past research has emphasized the consequences of stress on fully developed physiological systems in the brain and periphery, but more recent studies have explored the impact of stress on systems at different stages of maturation, with differential effects being revealed. This review provides an overview of the diverse effects of stress at critical developmental stages and the potential outcomes that may be associated with experiencing environmental adversity during ontogeny.

This process is critical for the establishment of neural circuits that control the proper integration of information perceived by the organism and the resulting response. While neurons at different levels of the CNS project axons across the midline, the molecules that regulate this process are common to many if not all midline-crossing regions. This article reviews the molecules that function as guidance cues at the midline in the developing vertebrate spinal cord, cortico-spinal tract and corpus callosum. As well, we describe the mutations that have been identified in humans that are linked to axon guidance and midline-crossing defects.

The effect of contact size (in the clinical range: 1-10 mm(2)) on HFO detection has not been determined. This study assesses the feasibility of HFO detection in a rat epilepsy model using macrocontacts and clinical amplifiers, and the effect of contact size on HFO detection within the macrocontact range. Methods: Eight epileptic rats were implanted with intracerebral electrodes containing three adjacent contacts of different sizes (0.02, 0.05 and 0.09 mm(2)). HFOs were manually marked on 5 min interictal EEG segments. HFO rates and durations were compared between the different contacts. Results: 10,966 ripples and 1475 fast ripples were identified in the recordings from 30 contacts. There were no significant differences in spike or HFO rates between the different contact sizes, nor was there a significant difference in HFO duration. Conclusions: HFOs can be detected in a rat epilepsy model using macrocontacts. Within the studied range, size did not significantly influence HFO detection. Significance: Using comparative anatomy of rat and human limbic structures, these findings suggest that reducing the size of macrocontacts (compared to those commercially available) would not improve HFO detection rates.

Methods: Thirteen healthy young adults performed a psychomotor vigilance task and postural tasks after a night of sleep and after 25 h of sleep deprivation. Primary outcome variables were calculated from the center of pressure (CoP) displacement measured by two force plates in various cognitive load and visual state conditions. Results: Sleep deprivation increased CoP anterior-posterior range in the no cognitive load condition and decreased CoP mediolateral range and velocity in the high cognitive load conditions. Sleep deprivation effects on the mediolateral range in the eyes open high cognitive load condition were significantly correlated with its effects on the psychomotor vigilance task. Conclusions: Sleep deprivation destabilizes postural control when attentional and sensory resources are not challenged. In high cognitive load condition, sleep loss induces a general freezing effect that seems to be modulated by the degree of impairment in psychomotor speed. Significance: This study demonstrates that sleep pressure has a destabilizing effect on postural control independently of circadian factors, therefore suggesting that sleep debt may be a significant risk factor for falls.

Significant cortical thinning was found in the participants with FASD in large areas of the bilateral middle frontal lobe, pre- and post- central areas, lateral and inferior temporal and occipital lobes compared to controls. No significant cortical thickness increases were observed for the FASD group. Cortical thinning with age in a linear model was observed in both groups, but the locations were different for each group. FASD participants showed thinning with age in the left middle frontal, bilateral precentral, bilateral precuneus and paracingulate, left inferior occipital and bilateral fusiform gyri; while controls showed decreases with age in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral precuneus gyrus, and bilateral occipital gyrus. A battery of cognitive assessments of memory, attention, motor, and verbal abilities was conducted with many of the FASD participants, but no significant correlations were found between these cognitive scores and regional cortical thickness. Non-invasive measurements of cortical thickness in children to young adults with FASD have identified both key regions of cortex that may be more deleteriously affected by prenatal alcohol exposure as well as cortical changes with age that differ from normal developmental thinning.

While the right hemisphere and valence hypotheses have long been used to explain the results of research on emotional stimulus processing, including nonverbal and verbal stimuli, data on emotional word processing are mostly inconsistent with both hypotheses. Three complementary lines of research data from behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies seem to suggest that both hemispheres have access to the meanings of emotional words, although their time course of activation may be different. The left hemisphere activates these words automatically early in processing, whereas the right hemisphere gains access to emotional words slowly when attention is recruited by the meaning of these words in a controlled manner. This processing dichotomy probably corroborates the complementary roles the two hemispheres play in data processing.

The second-to-fourth digit length ratio (2D:4D), a proxy of prenatal testosterone exposure, has been linked to a wide variety of sexually differentiated dispositions and behaviors. We examine the relationship between digit length ratios (2D:4D and rel2, the length of the second finger relative to the sum of the lengths of all four fingers) and risk-taking behaviors across five domains: financial, social, recreational, ethical, and health. In a sub-sample of male Caucasians (ethnically homogeneous), lower rel2 was predictive of greater financial, social, and recreational risk-taking, whereas lower 2D:4D was predictive of greater risk-taking in two domains (social and recreational). In the full male sub-sample (ethnically heterogeneous), the only significant correlation was a negative association between 2D:4D and financial risk. A composite measure of risk-taking across all five domains revealed that both rel2 and 2D:4D were negatively correlated with overall risk-taking in both male sub-samples. No significant correlations were found in the female sub-samples. Finally, men were more risk-seeking than women across all five contexts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the importance of the IL-1 and TNF systems for peripheral nerve regeneration and the mechanisms by which these cytokines mediate effects are to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that mRNA and protein levels of IL-1 beta and TNF are rapidly upregulated in the injured mouse sciatic nerve. Mice lacking both IL-1 beta and TNF, or both IL-1 type 1 receptor (IL-1R1) and TNF type 1 receptor (TNFR1), showed reduced nociceptive sensitivity (mechanical allodynia) compared with wild-type littermates after injury. Microinjecting recombinant IL-1 beta or TNF at the site of sciatic nerve injury in IL-1 beta- and TNF-knock-out mice restored mechanical pain thresholds back to levels observed in injured wild-type mice. Importantly, recovery of sciatic nerve function was impaired in IL-1 beta-, TNF-, and IL-1 beta/TNF-knock-out mice. Notably, the infiltration of neutrophils was almost completely prevented in the sciatic nerve distal stump of mice lacking both IL-1R1 and TNFR1. Systemic treatment of mice with an anti-Ly6G antibody to deplete neutrophils, cells that play an essential role in the genesis of neuropathic pain, did not affect recovery of neurological function and peripheral axon regeneration. Together, these results suggest that targeting specific IL-1 beta/TNF-dependent responses, such as neutrophil infiltration, is a better therapeutic strategy for treatment of neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury than complete blockage of cytokine production.

A subset of DA neurons has been shown to express the type 2 Vesicular glutamate transporter(Vglut2) and may therefore corelease glutamate. In the present study, we analyzed mice with a conditional deletion of Vglut2 in DA neurons (Vglut2(f/f;DAT-Cre)) to address the functional significance of the glutamate-DA cophenotype for responses to cocaine and food reinforcement. Biochemical parameters of striatal DA function were also examined by using DA receptor autoradiography, immediate-early gene quantitative in situ hybridization after cocaine challenge, and DA-selective in vivo chronoamperometry. Mice in which Vglut2 expression had been abrogated in DA neurons displayed enhanced operant self-administration of both high-sucrose food and intravenous cocaine. Furthermore, cocaine seeking maintained by drug-paired cues was increased by 76%, showing that reward-dependent plasticity is perturbed in these mice. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that adaptive changes occurred in both the ventral and dorsal striatum in the absence of VGLUT2: DA receptor binding was increased, and basal mRNA levels of the DA-induced early genes Nur77 and c-fos were elevated as after cocaine induction. Furthermore, in vivo challenge of the DA system by potassium-evoked depolarization revealed less DA release in both striatal areas. This study demonstrates that absence of VGLUT2 in DA neurons leads to perturbations of reward consumption as well as reward-associated memory, features of particular relevance for addictive-like behavior.

The present study thus aimed at identifying in human post-mortem brain tissues a set of suitable endogenous reference genes (ERG) for the expression analysis of potential candidate genes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mRNA levels of ten common ERGs (ACTB, GAPDH, GPS1,GUSB,M-RIP, PGK1, POL2RF, PPIA, UBE2D2, and YES1) were determined in the frontal cortex of autopsy-confirmed AD and non-demented control cases (n = 20) using SYBR Green technology. Then, these levels were ranked according to their expression stability using three software applications: geNorm, NormFinder and Best-Keeper. Whereas PPIA and UBE2D2 were among the ERGs with the most reliable expression. ACTS was the worst. Subsequently, using PPIA and UBE2D2 as ERGs for normalization, the mRNA levels of paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and paraoxonase 2 (PON2) were quantified in the frontal cortex of AD and control cases (n = 80) and analyzed using the REST 2009 program. Our results indicate that both paraoxonases are expressed in the human frontal cortex and that PON2 but not PON1 mRNA levels are up-regulated in AD relative to non-demented controls. However, re-analysis of the results by ANCOVA indicated that the significance of the difference between AD and control groups depended upon the ERG used for normalization. The use of a computational method allowing the inclusion of possible confounding factors is thus recommended for the analysis of data. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DNA methylation of SPARC and chronic low back pain	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article						SPARC; back pain; DNA methylation; epigenetics; intervertebral disc; aging; gene expression; disc degeneration	INTERVERTEBRAL DISC; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; NUCLEUS PULPOSUS; GENE-EXPRESSION; CPG METHYLATION; LUMBAR SPINE; DEGENERATION; CHROMATIN; MOUSE; MICE	Background: The extracellular matrix protein SPARC (Secreted Protein, Acidic, Rich in Cysteine) has been linked to degeneration of the intervertebral discs and chronic low back pain (LBP). In humans, SPARC protein expression is decreased as a function of age and disc degeneration. In mice, inactivation of the SPARC gene results in the development of accelerated age-dependent disc degeneration concurrent with age-dependent behavioral signs of chronic LBP. DNA methylation is the covalent modification of DNA by addition of methyl moieties to cytosines in DNA. DNA methylation plays an important role in programming of gene expression, including in the dynamic regulation of changes in gene expression in response to aging and environmental signals. We tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation down-regulates SPARC expression in chronic LBP in pre-clinical models and in patients with chronic LBP. Results: Our data shows that aging mice develop anatomical and behavioral signs of disc degeneration and back pain, decreased SPARC expression and increased methylation of the SPARC promoter. In parallel, we show that human subjects with back pain exhibit signs of disc degeneration and increased methylation of the SPARC promoter. Methylation of either the human or mouse SPARC promoter silences its activity in transient transfection assays. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that DNA methylation of a single gene plays a role in chronic pain in humans and animal models. This has important implications for understanding the mechanisms involved in chronic pain and for pain therapy.

As opposed to smell and taste, we still lack knowledge on the relationship between receptor binding and perception for the trigeminal system. We therefore investigated the sensitivity of the intranasal trigeminal system towards agonists of the trigeminal receptors TRPM8 and TRPA1 by assessing subjects' ability to identify which nostril has been stimulated in a monorhinal stimulation design. We summed the number of correct identifications resulting in a lateralization score. Stimuli were menthol (activating TRPM8 receptors), eucalyptol (TRPM8), mustard oil (TRPA1) and two mixtures thereof (menthol/eucalyptol and menthol/mustard oil). In addition, we examined the relationship between intensity and lateralization scores and investigated whether intensity evaluation and lateralization scores of the mixtures show additive effects. All stimuli were correctly lateralized significantly above chance. Across subjects the lateralization scores for single compounds activating the same receptor showed a stronger correlation than stimuli activating different receptors. Although single compounds were isointense, the mixture of menthol and eucalyptol (activating only TRPM8) was perceived as weaker and was lateralized less accurately than the mixture of menthol and mustard oil (activating both TRPM8 and TRPA1) suggesting suppression effects in the former mixture. In conclusion, sensitivity of different subpopulations of trigeminal sensory neurons seems to be related, but only to a certain degree. The large coherence in sensitivity between various intranasal trigeminal stimuli suggests that measuring sensitivity to one single trigeminal chemical stimulus may be sufficient to generally assess the trigeminal system's chemosensitivity. Further, for stimuli activating the same receptor a mixture suppression effect appears to occur similar to that observed in the other chemosensory systems. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Despite extensive study of these rhythms in the entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1, almost nothing is known regarding their generation and organization in the structure delivering the most prominent hippocampal output: the subiculum. Here we show using a complete rat hippocampal preparation in vitro that the subiculum intrinsically and independently generates spontaneous slow (25-50 Hz) and fast (100-150 Hz) gamma rhythms during the rising phase and peak of persistent subicular theta rhythms. These two gamma frequencies are phase modulated by theta rhythms without any form of afferent input from the entorhinal cortex or CA1. Subicular principal cells and interneurons phase lock to both fast and slow gamma, and single cells are independently phase modulated by each form of gamma rhythm, enabling selective participation in neural synchrony at both gamma frequencies at different times. Fast GABAergic inhibition is required for the generation of fast gamma, whereas slow gamma is generated by excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. In addition, the transverse subicular axis exhibits gamma rhythm topography with faster gamma coupling arising in the distal subiculum region. The subiculum therefore possesses a unique intrinsic circuit organization that can autonomously regulate the timing and topography of hippocampal output synchronization. These results suggest the subiculum is a third spontaneous gamma generator in the hippocampal formation (in addition to CA3 and the entorhinal cortex), and these gamma rhythms likely play an active role in mediating the flow of information between the hippocampus and multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions.

Methods: The present study investigated the effects of sports concussion on brain metabolism using (1)H-MR Spectroscopy by comparing a group of 10 non-concussed athletes with a group of 10 concussed athletes of the same age (mean: 22.5 years) and education (mean: 16 years) within both the acute and chronic post-injury phases. All athletes were scanned 1-6 days post-concussion and again 6-months later in a 3T Siemens MRI. Results: Concussed athletes demonstrated neurometabolic impairment in prefrontal and motor (M1) cortices in the acute phase where NAA:Cr levels remained depressed relative to controls. There was some recovery observed in the chronic phase where Glu:Cr levels returned to those of control athletes; however, there was a pathological increase of m-I:Cr levels in M1 that was only present in the chronic phase. Conclusions: These results confirm cortical neurometabolic changes in the acute post-concussion phase as well as recovery and continued metabolic abnormalities in the chronic phase. The results indicate that complex pathophysiological processes differ depending on the post-injury phase and the neurometabolite in question.

Larger amygdala but no change in hippocampal volume in 10-year-old children exposed to maternal depressive symptomatology since birth	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						child; brain; development; parental care	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; MAJOR DEPRESSION; HORMONE LEVELS; MENTAL-HEALTH; SEXUAL-ABUSE; CHILDHOOD; CORTISOL; CARE	Maternal separation and poor maternal care in animals have been shown to have important effects on the developing hippocampus and amygdala. In humans, children exposed to abuse/maltreatment or orphanage rearing do not present changes in hippocampal volumes. However, children reared in orphanages present enlarged amygdala volumes, suggesting that the amygdala may be particularly sensitive to severely disturbed (i.e., discontinous, neglectful) care in infancy. Maternal depressive symptomatology has been associated with reductions in overall sensitivity to the infant, and with an increased rate of withdrawn, disengaged behaviors. To determine if poor maternal care associated with maternal depressive symptomatology has a similar pattern of association to the volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala in children, as is the case for severely disturbed infant care (orphanage rearing), we measured hippocampal and amygdala volumes as well as stress hormone (glucocorticoid) levels in children exposed (n = 17) or not (n = 21) to maternal depressive symptomatology since birth. Results revealed no group difference in hippocampal volumes, but larger left and right amygdala volumes and increased levels of glucocorticoids in the children of mothers presenting depressive symptomatology since birth. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was observed between mothers' mean depressive scores and amygdala volumes in their children. The results of this study suggest that amygdala volume in human children may represent an early marker of biological sensitivity to quality of maternal care.

Counts of innovation per taxonomic group are now available in hundreds of avian and primate species, as are counts of tactical deception, tool use and social learning. Robust evidence suggests that innovation rate and its neural correlates allow birds and mammals to cope better with environmental change. The positive correlations between taxonomic counts, and the increasing number of cognitive and neural measures found to be associated with ecological variables, suggest that domain general processes might be more pervasive than previously thought in the evolution of intelligence.

For example, interaction torques arise when motion of individual arm segments propagates to adjacent segments causing their movement without any muscle contractions. Since these passive joint torques significantly add to the overall torques generated by active muscular contractions, they must be taken into account during planning or execution of goal-directed movements. We investigated the role of the corticospinal tract in compensating for the interaction torques during arm movements in humans. Twelve subjects reached to visual targets with their arm supported by a robotic exoskeleton. Reaching to one target was accompanied by interaction torques that assisted the movement, while reaching to the other target was accompanied by interaction torques that resisted the movement. Corticospinal excitability was assessed at different times during movement using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the upper-arm region of M1 (primary motor cortex). We found that TMS responses in shoulder monoarticular and elbow-shoulder biarticular muscles changed together with the interaction torques during movements in which the interaction torques were resistive. In contrast, TMS responses did not correlate with assistive interaction torques or with co-contraction. This suggests that the descending motor command includes compensation for passive limb dynamics. Furthermore, our results suggest that compensation for interaction torques involves the biarticular muscles, which span both shoulder and elbow joints and are in a biomechanically advantageous position to provide such compensation.

Here, we investigate the effects of immune cells on neuronal viability and axonal growth and show that conditioned media from myeloid lineage cells inhibit neurite outgrowth without causing apoptosis. Treatment with monocyte conditioned medium enhances myosin light chain phosphorylation in neurons and the neurite outgrowth inhibitory effect of myeloid lineage cells can be attenuated with the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin. Our results suggest that in the context of CNS inflammation myeloid cells may limit axonal repair in the CNS via a myosin II-dependent mechanism. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and immune activation are implicated in HAND pathogenesis, relationships of LPS and inflammatory markers to mild forms of HAND or impairment in specific cognitive domains are unknown. To examine these relationships, we compared plasma soluble CD14 (sCD14), CCL2, and LPS levels with neurocognitive test scores in a cART era cohort. Methods: We analyzed plasma from HIV+ subjects (n = 97) with nadir CD4 counts <300 and high frequency of hepatitis C virus coinfection and illicit drug use for relationships between sCD14, CCL2, and LPS levels and neurocognitive test scores. Results: Plasma sCD14 levels were higher in subjects with test scores indicating global impairment (P = 0.007), particularly in attention and learning domains (P = 0.015 and P = 0.03, respectively), regardless of HAND diagnosis. Plasma sCD14 levels correlated inversely with global, attention, and learning T scores (P = 0.036, 0.047, and 0.007, respectively) and yielded higher area under receiver operating characteristic values for predicting impaired scores than single-marker models based on plasma or cerebrospinal fluid viral load or CD4 count (area under receiver operating characteristic values = 0.71, 0.81, and 0.71, respectively) and in 4-marker models based on plasma sCD14 and 3 conventional markers compared with the 3-marker models. Conclusions: Plasma sCD14 is a biomarker associated with impaired neurocognitive testing in attention and learning domains in HIV-infected individuals with advanced disease, suggesting involvement of cortical and limbic pathways by inflammatory processes in the cART era. Plasma sCD14 is a potential biomarker to monitor HAND progression and therapeutic responses.

The interpretation of neuroimaging studies in the context of aging is rendered difficult due to the challenge in untangling the composite effect of these modifications. In this work we integrate multimodal optical imaging in biophysical models to investigate vascular and metabolic changes occurring in aging. Multispectral intrinsic optical imaging of an animal model of healthy aging, the LOU/c rat, is used in combination with somatosensory stimulation to study the modifications of the hemodynamic response with increasing age. Results are fitted with three macroscopic biophysical models to extract parameters, providing a phenomenological description of vascular and metabolic changes.

Thus, a central objective of this functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness on the neural responses to emotionally laden stimuli. Another major goal of this study was to examine the impact of the extent of mindfulness training on the brain mechanisms supporting the processing of emotional stimuli. Twelve experienced (with over 1000 h of practice) and 10 beginner meditators were scanned as they viewed negative, positive, and neutral pictures in a mindful state and a non-mindful state of awareness. Results indicated that the Mindful condition attenuated emotional intensity perceived from pictures, while brain imaging data suggested that this effect was achieved through distinct neural mechanisms for each group of participants. For experienced meditators compared with beginners, mindfulness induced a deactivation of default mode network areas (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) across all valence categories and did not influence responses in brain regions involved in emotional reactivity during emotional processing. On the other hand, for beginners relative to experienced meditators, mindfulness induced a down-regulation of the left amygdala during emotional processing. These findings suggest that the long-term practice of mindfulness leads to emotional stability by promoting acceptance of emotional states and enhanced present-moment awareness, rather than by eliciting control over low-level affective cerebral systems from higher-order cortical brain regions. These results have implications for affect-related psychological disorders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We predicted that manic, depressed, and euthymic bipolar patients (BPs) would display impaired decision-making, and we tested whether clinical characteristics could predict patients' decision-making performance. Methods: Subjects (N = 317; age range: 18-65 years) including 167 BPs (45 manic and 32 depressed inpatients, and 90 euthymic outpatients) and 150 age-, IQ-, and gender-matched healthy control (HC) participants, were included within three university psychiatric hospitals using a cross-sectional design. The relationship between predictor variables and decision-making was assessed by one-step multivariate analysis. The main outcome measures were overall decision-making ability on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and an index of sensitivity to punishment frequency. Results: Manic, depressed, and euthymic BPs selected significantly more cards from the risky decks than HCs (p < .001, p < .01, and p < .05, respectively), with no significant differences between the three BD groups. However, like HCs, BPs preferred decks that yielded infrequent penalties over those yielding frequent penalties. In multivariate analysis, decision-making impairment was significantly (p < .001) predicted by low level of education, high depressive scores, family history of BD, use of benzodiazepines, and nonuse of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants. Conclusions: BPs have a trait-related impairment in decision-making that does not vary across illness phase. However, some subtle differences between the BD groups in the individual deck analyses may point to subtle state influences on reinforcement mechanisms, in addition to a more fundamental trait impairment in risk-sensitive decision making.

KIF1A, an Axonal Transporter of Synaptic Vesicles, Is Mutated in Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy Type 2	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							SERINE PALMITOYLTRANSFERASE; GENE; MUTATIONS; PROTEIN; KINESIN; BINDING; EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR; SUBUNIT; ELEGANS	Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSANII) is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by peripheral nerve degeneration resulting in a severe distal sensory loss. Although mutations in FAM134B and the HSN2 exon of WNK1 were associated with HSANII, the etiology of a substantial number of cases remains unexplained. In addition, the functions of WNK1/HSN2 and FAM134B and their role in the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that KIF1A, an axonal transporter of synaptic vesicles, interacts with the domain encoded by the HSN2 exon. In parallel to this screen, we performed genome-wide homozygosity mapping in a consanguineous Afghan family affected by HSANII and identified a unique region of homozygosity located on chromosome 2q37.3 and spanning the KIF1A gene locus. Sequencing of KIF1A in this family revealed a truncating mutation segregating with the disease phenotype. Subsequent sequencing of KIF1A in a series of 112 unrelated patients with features belonging to the clinical spectrum of ulcero-mutilating sensory neuropathies revealed truncating mutations in three additional families, thus indicating that mutations in KIF1A are a rare cause of HSANII. Similarly to WNK1 mutations, pathogenic mutations in KIF1A were almost exclusively restricted to an alternatively spliced exon. This study provides additional insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HSANII and highlights the potential biological relevance of alternative splicing in the peripheral sensory nervous system.

Transit Defect of Potassium-Chloride Co-transporter 3 Is a Major Pathogenic Mechanism in Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRANSMEMBRANE CONDUCTANCE REGULATOR; CHANNEL ACTIVITY; CURCUMIN; KCC3; CL; EXPRESSION; TRUNCATION; MUTATIONS; CFTR	Missense and protein-truncating mutations of the human potassium-chloride co-transporter 3 gene (KCC3) cause hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC), which is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized by axonal dysfunction and neurodevelopmental defects. We previously reported that KCC3-truncating mutations disrupt brain-type creatine kinase-dependent activation of the co-transporter through the loss of its last 140 amino acids. Here, we report a novel and more distal HMSN/ACC-truncating mutation (3402C -> T; R1134X) that eliminates only the last 17 residues of the protein. This small truncation disrupts the interaction with brain-type creatine kinase in mammalian cells but also affects plasma membrane localization of the mutant transporter. Although it is not truncated, the previously reported HMSN/ACC-causing 619C -> T (R207C) missense mutation also leads to KCC3 loss of function in Xenopus oocyte flux assay. Immunodetection in Xenopus oocytes and in mammalian cultured cells revealed a decreased amount of R207C at the plasma membrane, with significant retention of the mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. In mammalian cells, curcumin partially corrected these mutant protein mislocalizations, with more protein reaching the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that mis-trafficking of mutant protein is an important pathophysiological feature of HMSN/ACC causative KCC3 mutations.

Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are primarily responsible for the substantially increased frequency of the disease seen in the relatives of affected individuals(2,3), and systematic attempts to identify linkage in multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest individual effect on risk(4). Modestly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS)(5-10) have enabled more than 20 additional risk loci to be identified and have shown that multiple variants exerting modest individual effects have a key role in disease susceptibility(11). Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the disease remains to be defined and is anticipated to require the analysis of sample sizes that are beyond the numbers currently available to individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries, we have replicated almost all of the previously suggested associations and identified at least a further 29 novel susceptibility loci. Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies the independent protective effect attributable to the class I region. Immunologically relevant genes are significantly overrepresented among those mapping close to the identified loci and particularly implicate T-helper-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

TRPM7 Is Required within Zebrafish Sensory Neurons for the Activation of Touch-Evoked Escape Behaviors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LARVAL ZEBRAFISH; EMBRYONIC-DEVELOPMENT; MG2+ HOMEOSTASIS; MAUTHNER CELL; IN-VIVO; CHANNEL; NETWORK; VERTEBRATE; KINASE; MOTOR	Mutations in the gene encoding TRPM7 (trpm7), a member of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) superfamily of cation channels that possesses an enzymatically active kinase at its C terminus, cause the touch-unresponsive zebrafish mutant touchdown. We identified and characterized a new allele of touchdown, as well as two previously reported alleles, and found that all three alleles harbor mutations that abolish channel activity. Through the selective restoration of TRPM7 expression in sensory neurons, we found that TRPM7's kinase activity and selectivity for divalent cations over monovalent cations were dispensable for touch-evoked activation of escape behaviors in zebrafish. Additional characterization revealed that sensory neurons were present and capable of responding to tactile stimuli in touchdown mutants, indicating that TRPM7 is not required for sensory neuron survival or mechanosensation. Finally, exposure to elevated concentrations of divalent cations was found to restore touch-evoked behaviors in touchdown mutants. Collectively, these findings are consistent with a role for zebrafish TRPM7 within sensory neurons in the modulation of neurotransmitter release at central synapses, similar to that proposed for mammalian TRPM7 at peripheral synapses.

The role of activated microglia in the pathogenesis of AD remains controversial: either clearing A beta deposits by phagocytosis or releasing proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic substances. Microglia can be activated via toll-like receptors (TLRs), a class of pattern-recognition receptors in the innate immune system. We previously demonstrated that an AD mouse model homozygous for a loss-of-function mutation of TLR4 had increases in A beta deposits and buffer-soluble A beta in the brain as compared with a TLR4 wild-type AD mouse model at 14-16 months of age. However, it is unknown if TLR4 signaling is involved in initiation of A beta deposition as well as activation and recruitment of microglia at the early stage of AD. Here, we investigated the role of TLR4 signaling and microglial activation in early stages using 5-month-old AD mouse models when Ab deposits start. Methods: Microglial activation and amyloid deposition in the brain were determined by immunohistochemistry in the AD models. Levels of cerebral soluble A beta were determined by ELISA. mRNA levels of cytokines and chemokines in the brain and A beta-stimulated monocytes were quantified by real-time PCR. Cognitive functions were assessed by the Morris water maze. Results: While no difference was found in cerebral A beta load between AD mouse models at 5 months with and without TLR4 mutation, microglial activation in a TLR4 mutant AD model (TLR4M Tg) was less than that in a TLR4 wild-type AD model (TLR4W Tg). At 9 months, TLR4M Tg mice had increased A beta deposition and soluble A beta 42 in the brain, which were associated with decrements in cognitive functions and expression levels of IL-1 beta, CCL3, and CCL4 in the hippocampus compared to TLR4W Tg mice. TLR4 mutation diminished A beta-induced IL-1 beta, CCL3, and CCL4 expression in monocytes. Conclusion: This is the first demonstration of TLR4-dependent activation of microglia at the early stage of beta-amyloidosis. Our results indicate that TLR4 is not involved in the initiation of A beta deposition and that, as A beta deposits start, microglia are activated via TLR4 signaling to reduce A beta deposits and preserve cognitive functions from A beta-mediated neurotoxicity.

CDF Collaboration	Measurement of the t(t)over-bar production cross section in p(p)over-bar collisions at root s=1.96 TeV using events with large missing transverse energy and jets	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS	In this paper we report a measurement of the t (t) over bar production cross section in p (p) over bar collisions at root s = 1.96 TeV using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb(-1) collected with the CDF II detector at the Tevatron accelerator. We select events with significant missing transverse energy and high jet multiplicity. This measurement vetoes the presence of explicitly identified electrons and muons, thus enhancing the tau contribution of t (t) over bar decays. Signal events are discriminated from the background using a neural network, and heavy flavor jets are identified by a secondary-vertex tagging algorithm. We measure a t (t) over bar production cross section of 7.99 +/- 0.55(stat) +/- 0.76(syst) +/- 0.46(lumi) pb, assuming a top mass m(top) = 172.5 GeV/c(2), in agreement with previous measurements and standard model predictions.

These SW comprise a negative phase, during which cortical neurons are mostly silent, and a positive phase, in which most neurons fire intensively. Previous work showed, using EEG spectral analysis as an index of cortical synchrony, that Morning-types (M-types) present faster dynamics of sleep pressure than Evening-types (E-types). We thus hypothesized that single SW properties will also show larger changes in M-types than in E-types in response to increased sleep pressure. SW density (number per minute) and characteristics (amplitude, slope between negative and positive peaks, frequency and duration of negative and positive phases) were compared between chronotypes for a baseline sleep episode (BL) and for recovery sleep (REC) after two nights of sleep fragmentation. While SW density did not differ between chronotypes, M-types showed higher SW amplitude and steeper slope than E-types, especially during REC. SW properties were also averaged for 3 NREM sleep periods selected for their decreasing level of sleep pressure (first cycle of REC [REC1], first cycle of BL [BL1] and fourth cycle of BL [BL4]). Slope was significantly steeper in M-types than in E-types in REC1 and BL1. SW frequency was consistently higher and duration of positive and negative phases constantly shorter in M-types than in E-types. Our data reveal that specific properties of cortical synchrony during sleep differ between M-types and E-types, although chronotypes show a similar capacity to generate SW. These differences may involve 1) stable trait characteristics independent of sleep pressure (i.e., frequency and durations) likely linked to the length of silent and burst-firing phases of individual neurons, and 2) specific responses to increased sleep pressure (i.e., slope and amplitude) expected to depend on the synchrony between neurons.

Worldwide, it is estimated there are 15-20 million HTLV-1-infected individuals; although the majority of HTLV-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic carriers (AC) during their lifetime, 2-5% of AC develops either ATL or HAM/TSP, but never both. Regardless of asymptomatic status or clinical outcome, HTLV-1 carriers are at high risk of opportunistic infection. The progression to pathological HTLV-1 disease is in part attributed to the failure of the innate and adaptive immune system to control virus spread. The innate immune response against retroviral infection requires recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) dependent pathways, leading to the induction of host antiviral and inflammatory responses. Recent studies have begun to characterize the interplay between HTLV-1 infection and the innate immune response and have identified distinct gene expression profiles in patients with ATL or HAM/TSP - upregulation of growth regulatory pathways in ATL and constitutive activation of antiviral and inflammatory pathways in HAM/STP. In this review, we provide an overview of the replicative lifecycle of HTLV-1 and the distinct pathologies associated with HTLV-1 infection. We also explore the innate immune mechanisms that respond to HTLV-1 infection, the strategies used by HTLV-1 to subvert these defenses and their contribution to HTLV-1-associated diseases.

The neural encoding of self-motion	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article							VESTIBULAR-NERVE AFFERENTS; PERIPHERAL INNERVATION PATTERNS; SEMICIRCULAR CANAL AFFERENTS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; PROPRIOCEPTIVE INPUTS; DETECTION THRESHOLDS; HEADING PERCEPTION; HIGH-FREQUENCY; VISUAL-CORTEX; EYE-MOVEMENT	As we move through the world, information can be combined from multiple sources in order to allow us to perceive our self-motion. The vestibular system detects and encodes the motion of the head in space. In addition, extra-vestibular cues such as retinal-image motion (optic flow), proprioception, and motor efference signals, provide valuable motion cues. Here I focus on the coding strategies that are used by the brain to create neural representations of self-motion. I review recent studies comparing the thresholds of single versus populations of vestibular afferent and central neurons. I then consider recent advances in understanding the brain's strategy for combining information from the vestibular sensors with extra-vestibular cues to estimate self-motion. These studies emphasize the need to consider not only the rules by which multiple inputs are combined, but also how differences in the behavioral context govern the nature of what defines the optimal computation.

The method performs tissue classification using a model of intensities of the normal appearing brain tissues. In order to estimate the model, a trimmed likelihood estimator is initialized with a hierarchical random approach in order to be robust to MS lesions and other outliers present in real images. The algorithm is first evaluated with simulated images to assess the importance of the robust estimator in presence of outliers. The method is then validated using clinical data in which MS lesions were delineated manually by several experts. Our method obtains an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.65, which is close to the average DSC obtained by raters (0.66).

Endoscopic Endonasal Resection of the Odontoid Process as a Standalone Decompressive Procedure for Basilar Invagination in Chiari Type I Malformation	MINIMALLY INVASIVE NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						transnasal approach; skull base; Chiari malformation; endoscopy	BRAIN-STEM COMPRESSION; CRANIOVERTEBRAL JUNCTION; TRANSORAL ODONTOIDECTOMY; CRANIOCERVICAL JUNCTION; ANTERIOR; EXPERIENCE	Background: The expanded endonasal approach of the cranio-cervical junction provides comfortable working space while avoiding some of the disadvantages of the transoral route. We report a purely endonasal endoscopic resection of the odontoid process for basilar invagination in a patient with a Chiari type I malformation, without posterior decompression or fusion. Case Report: A 54-year-old female patient presented with cranial nerve and brainstem deficits. CT and MRI showed a Chiari type I malformation and compression of the medulla by basilar invagination of the odontoid process. The tip of the latter was displaced up to the bulbo-pontine sulcus. The odontoid process was resected via the expanded endoscopic endonasal approach, without additional posterior decompression or fusion. The post-operative course was uneventful, including the absence of velopharyngeal insufficiency. Neurological deficits regressed rapidly. The preoperative cervical pain virtually disappeared. At 9 months follow-up, the patient had normal activity with minimal residual neurological deficits. Post-op dynamic radiography and CT showed stability of the cranio-cervical junction. Conclusion: Decompression of the bulbomedullary junction by purely endoscopic transnasal resection of the odontoid process is well tolerated and efficient. Immediate stabilization is not mandatory in all cases of congenital causes of basilar invagination.	[Scholtes, F.; Signorelli, F.; McLaughlin, N.; Bojanowski, M.

Method: Inclusive, double-blind, randomized, controlled, 8-week, parallel-group trial, conducted October 17, 2005 through January 30, 2009 in 8 Canadian academic and psychiatric clinics. Adult outpatients (N = 432) with MDE (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 5.0.0, criteria) lasting at least 4 weeks, including 40.3% taking antidepressants at baseline, were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of 1,050 mg/d of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 150 mg/d of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or matched sunflower oil placebo (2% fish oil). The primary outcome was the self-report Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR30); the secondary outcome was the clinician-rated Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Results: The adjusted mean difference between treatment and placebo. was 1.32 points (95% CI, -0.20 to 2.84; P = .088) on the IDS-SR30 and 0.97 points (95% CI, -0.012 to 1.95; P = .053) on the MADRS. Planned subgroup analyses revealed a significant interaction of comorbid anxiety disorders and study group (P = .035). For patients without comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 204), omega-3 supplementation was superior to placebo, with an adjusted mean difference of 3.17 points on the IDS-SR30 (95% CI, 0.89 to 5.45; P = .007) and 1.93 points (95% CI, 0.50 to 3.36; P = .008) on the MADRS. Conclusions: In this heterogeneous sample of patients with MDE, there was only a trend toward superiority of omega-3 supplementation over placebo in reducing depressive symptoms.

The aim of this study was to reproduce observations of regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities in a larger independent sample of patients and to explore correlations between regional cerebral blood flow and markers of neurodegeneration. Twenty patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and 20 healthy controls were studied by single-photon emission computerized tomography. Motor examination, color discrimination, and olfactory identification were examined. Patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder showed decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the frontal cortex and in medial parietal areas and increased regional cerebral blood flow in subcortical regions including the bilateral pons, putamen, and hippocampus. In rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, brain perfusion in the frontal cortex and occipital areas was associated with poorer performance in the color discrimination test. Moreover, a relationship between loss of olfactory discrimination and regional cerebral blood flow reduction in the bilateral anterior parahippocampal gyrus, a region known to be involved in olfactory functions, was found. This study provides further evidence of regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder that are similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Moreover, regional cerebral blood flow anomalies were associated with markers of neurodegeneration.

Recently, mutations in the Fused in sarcoma gene (FUS) were identified in familial (FALS) ALS cases and sporadic (SALS) patients. Similarly to TDP-43 (coded by TARDBP gene), FUS is an RNA binding protein. Using the zebrafish (Danio rerio), we examined the consequences of expressing human wild-type (WT) FUS and three ALS-related mutations, as well as their interactions with TARDBP and SOD1. Knockdown of zebrafish Fus yielded a motor phenotype that could be rescued upon co-expression of wild-type human FUS. In contrast, the two most frequent ALS-related FUS mutations, R521H and R521C, unlike S57 Delta, failed to rescue the knockdown phenotype, indicating loss of function. The R521H mutation caused a toxic gain of function when expressed alone, similar to the phenotype observed upon knockdown of zebrafish Fus. This phenotype was not aggravated by co-expression of both mutant human TARDBP (G348C) and FUS (R521H) or by knockdown of both zebrafish Tardbp and Fus, consistent with a common pathogenic mechanism. We also observed that WT FUS rescued the Tardbp knockdown phenotype, but not vice versa, suggesting that TARDBP acts upstream of FUS in this pathway. In addition we observed that WT SOD1 failed to rescue the phenotype observed upon overexpression of mutant TARDBP or FUS or upon knockdown of Tardbp or Fus; similarly, WT TARDBP or FUS also failed to rescue the phenotype induced by mutant SOD1 (G93A). Finally, overexpression of mutant SOD1 exacerbated the motor phenotype caused by overexpression of mutant FUS. Together our results indicate that TARDBP and FUS act in a pathogenic pathway that is independent of SOD1.

J	Mahfouz, W; Karsenty, G; Corcos, J				Mahfouz, Wally; Karsenty, Gilles; Corcos, Jacques			Injection of botulinum toxin type A in the urethral sphincter to treat lower urinary tract dysfunction: review of indications, techniques and results: 2011 update	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Review						botulinum toxin; urethral sphincter; detrusor sphincter dyssynergia; multiple sclerosis; spinal cord injury; detrusor hypocontractility	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; VOIDING DYSFUNCTION; TRANSPERINEAL INJECTION; BLADDER-NECK; DYSSYNERGIA; CHILDREN; EXPERIENCE; WOMEN; INCONTINENCE; DISORDERS	Introduction: The first application of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) in urology was its injection into the urinary sphincter to treat neurogenic detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) in quadriplegic men. Since that first report by Dyskatra et al in 1988, the results of focal BTA injections into the sphincter, the bladder wall and lately into the prostate have raised the interest of the urology community in this promising new therapeutic modality. This is an evidence-based review of the current indications, techniques and outcomes of BTA injections into the urethral sphincter. Materials and methods: The Medline database was searched for the period between 1966 and October 2010, using the keywords "botulinum toxin" and "urethra" or "urethral sphincter". English written articles were selected. A level of evidence according to the Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine was assigned to each article. Conclusion: Since our first review in 2006, very little has been added to the literature on the use of botulinum toxin injected into the external sphincter. At present, those most likely to benefit from intrasphincteric BTA injection are MS patients suffering the symptoms of DSD and quadriplegic men with DSD unable to perform self-catheterization. Well developed and conducted studies are necessary; these must be done urgently to better define the place and the results of this drug otherwise widely used in other indications in urology.

Possible Involvement of Programmed Cell Death Pathways in the Neuroprotective Action of Polyphenols	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article						AIF; Alzheimer's disease; caspases; epigallocatechin gallate; hippocampus; resveratrol	APOPTOSIS-INDUCING FACTOR; AMYLOID-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY; ALZHEIMER TRANSGENIC MICE; A-BETA TOXICITY; PRECURSOR PROTEIN; CASPASE-3 ACTIVATION; NITRIC-OXIDE; FACTOR AIF; DISEASE; GREEN	One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of senile plaques composed of extra-cellular aggregates of beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides. It is well established that at least in vitro, A beta triggers apoptotic cell death via the activation of caspase-dependent and -independent cell death effectors, namely caspase-3 and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), respectively. Epidemiological studies have reported that elderly people have a lower risk (up to 50%) of developing dementia if they regularly eat fruits and vegetables and drink tea and red wine (in moderation). Numerous studies indicate that polyphenols derived from these foods and beverages account for the observed neuroprotective effects. In particular, we have reported that polyphenols extracted from green tea (i.e. epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG) and red wine (i.e. resveratrol) block A beta-induced hippocampal cell death, by at least partially inhibiting A beta fibrillisation. It has been shown that polyphenols may also modulate caspase-dependent and -independent programmed cell death (PCD) pathways. Indeed, polyphenols including resveratrol, EGCG and luteolin significantly inhibit the activation of the key apoptotic executioner, caspase-3 and are able to modulate mitogen-activated protein kinases known to play an important role in neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, it has been reported that polyphenols may exert their anti-apoptotic action by inhibiting AIF release from mitochondria, thus providing new mechanism of action for polyphenols. This review aims to update the current knowledge regarding the differential effects of polyphenols on PCD pathways and discuss their putative neuroprotective action resulting from their capacity to modulate these pathways.

Participants and measures were derived from the Multimodal Treatment Study for ADHD including 534MTA participants and 254 normal controls. Despite improvement over time, MTA participants continued to receive higher ratings of ADHD symptomatology and exhibit greater difficulties across the majority of neuropsychological outcomes. No relations were found between improvements in neuropsychological functioning and ADHD symptomatology over time. Findings provide support for the persistence of neuropsychological functioning and ADHD symptomatology. Findings did not support the hypothesized relation between improvements in frontally-mediated neuropsychological functioning and ADHD symptomatology possibly due to the brief 1-year lag and limited assessment battery. Findings are discussed in relation to neuropsychological development including recommendations for future research.

The predictive classification performance of support vector machines method is investigated and compared with those of other classifiers such as artificial neural networks, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbours and decision trees. This paper discusses several validation strategies including randomization test, internal and external validations. The quality of the models was evaluated by the number of right classified compounds. The results obtained show that all methods used except k-nearest neighbours were good classifiers. The percentage of right classified compounds ranges from 87.7% to 95.4% and from 64.3% to 92.9% for the training and test sets, respectively. The relevant factors controlling the anti-HIV activity have been identified. The descriptors related to both steric characters ((6)chi(v)(ch), (4)chi(N)(P) and 1/S) and hydrophobic parameter (logP) seem to be very relevant in the establishment of structure-anti-HIV activity relationship.

Toxicology and Toxicokinetics of Oral Pantoprazole in Neonatal and Juvenile Dogs	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH PART B-DEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						juvenile toxicity; postnatal development; dog; pantoprazole	PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS; GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX DISEASE; LONG-TERM; CHILDREN; SAFETY	BACKGROUND: Pantoprazole is an irreversible inhibitor of H(+)/K(+) adenosine triphosphatase proton pump. This study encompassed the period of postnatal stomach development to determine whether immature animals are uniquely sensitive to progression of PPI-induced enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia. METHODS: Pantoprazole was administered to beagle dogs at 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day (10/sex/group) from PND 1 for 13 weeks, subsets of animals had a 13-week recovery period. Clinical signs, body weights, growth, clinical chemistry, and neurobehavioral endpoints were assessed. Selected organs were weighed and histologically examined. RESULTS: There were no effects on body weights, growth, landmarks of physical and reproductive development, or sensory and neurobehavioral function. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were increased at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, but resolved during the recovery period. Stomach weight was increased at all doses, but after recovery the differences in stomach weights resolved for females although male stomach weights remained slightly increased. Pantoprazole-related microscopic findings in the stomach consisted of increased mucosal height, glandular necrosis, and glandular dilation at all doses; and ECL cell hyperplasia, parietal cell vacuolation, and atrophy of chief cells are noted at 10 and/or 30 mg/kg/day. There was a partial recovery of these microscopic changes indicated by a decreased incidence and/or severity of increased mucosal height, glandular necrosis, ECL cell hyperplasia, and chief cell atrophy, and complete resolution of other microscopic observations. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole administered to beagles from PND 1 for 13 weeks resulted in findings similar to those in adult dogs and juvenile dogs, which showed no increase in severity or progression of ECL hyperplasia.

Inter- and intra-observer variation in soft-tissue sarcoma target definition	CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE			English	Article						Sarcoma; Radiotherapy; Contouring; Inter-observer variability; Intra-observer variability	GROSS TUMOR VOLUME; INTEROBSERVER VARIABILITY; CONFORMAL RADIOTHERAPY; BRAIN-TUMORS; LUNG-CANCER; DELINEATION; CT; PROSTATE; IMPACT; GTV	Purpose. - To evaluate inter- and intra-observer variability in gross tumor volume definition for adult limb/trunk soft tissue sarcomas. Patients and methods. - Imaging studies of 15 patients previously treated with preoperative radiation were used in this study. Five physicians (radiation oncologists, orthopedic surgeons and a musculoskeletal radiologist) were asked to contour each of the 15 tumors on T1-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images. These contours were drawn twice by each physician. The volume and center of mass coordinates for each gross tumor volume were extracted and a Boolean analysis was performed to measure the degree of volume overlap. Results. - The median standard deviation in gross tumor volumes across observers was 6.1% of the average volume (range: 1.8%-24.9%). There was remarkably little variation in the 3D position of the gross tumor volume center of mass. For the 15 patients, the standard deviation of the 3D distance between centers of mass ranged from 0.06 mm to 1.7 min (median 0.1 mm). Boolean analysis demonstrated that 53% to 90% of the gross tumor volume was common to all observers (median overlap: 79%). The standard deviation in gross tumor volumes on repeat contouring was 4.8% (range: 0.1-14.4%) with a standard deviation change in the position of the center of mass of 0.4 mm (range: 0 mm-2.6 mm) and a median overlap of 93% (range: 73%-98%). Conclusion. - Although significant inter-observer differences were seen in gross tumor volume definition of adult soft-tissue sarcoma, the center of mass of these volumes was remarkably consistent. Variations in volume definition did not correlate with tumor size. Radiation oncologists should not hesitate to review their contours with a colleague (surgeon, radiologist or fellow radiation oncologist) to ensure that they are not outliers in sarcoma gross tumor volume definition. Protocols should take into account variations in volume definition when considering tighter clinical target volumes. (C) 2011 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).

Infants treated for a single episode of SE, those treated for a single febrile seizure, and healthy infants were tested with respect to motor development, language, personal, and social skills and self-regulation. The children were divided into two age groups to investigate the impact of the convulsive event at different windows of brain maturation. We found that infants who had had SE were inferior to healthy controls on the development scales. Age differentiated SE impact on visuomotor development versus sociolinguistic development. Children who had been treated for SE had significantly more difficulties delaying a response to an attractive stimulus in one of the long-delay conditions. A single episode of SE can interfere with psychomotor and cognitive development in children without previous developmental delay, and it seems that the functions that are emerging at the time of insult are most vulnerable.

Few studies have examined whether chronic exposure at lower levels could adversely affect children's cognitive development. OBJECTIVE: We examined associations between prenatal and postnatal exposure to OP pesticides and cognitive abilities in school-age children. METHODS: We conducted a birth cohort study (Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas study) among predominantly Latino farmworker families from an agricultural community in California. We assessed exposure to OP pesticides by measuring dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites in urine collected during pregnancy and from children at 6 months and 1, 2, 3.5, and 5 years of age. We administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition, to 329 children 7 years of age. Analyses were adjusted for maternal education and intelligence, Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment score, and language of cognitive assessment. RESULTS: Urinary DAP concentrations measured during the first and second half of pregnancy had similar relations to cognitive scores, so we used the average of concentrations measured during pregnancy in further analyses. Averaged maternal DAP concentrations were associated with poorer scores for Working Memory, Processing Speed, Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, and Full-Scale intelligence quotient (IQ). Children in the highest quintile of maternal DAP concentrations had an average deficit of 7.0 IQ points compared with those in the lowest quintile. However, children's urinary DAP concentrations were not consistently associated with cognitive scores. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal but not postnatal urinary DAP concentrations were associated with poorer intellectual development in 7-year-old children. Maternal urinary DAP concentrations in the present study were higher but nonetheless within the range of levels measured in the general U.S. population.

Along with this assumption, slowing down the speed of presentation of these movements might improve their imitative performances. To test this hypothesis, 19 children with autism, 37 typically-developing children and 17 children with Down syndrome were asked to reproduce facial and body movements presented on a computer at a normal/ecological and two slowed down speeds. Our main result showed that a subgroup of individuals with severe autism better reproduced the movements when presented slowly than at the ecological speed. This finding opens a new window for comprehension and rehabilitation of perceptual and imitative deficits in autism.

Given that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a subcellular compartment involved in metabolic control and cell death signalling and that cytoskeleton disruption, as encountered during cancer cell invasion, can lead to ER stress, we questioned whether MT1-MMP contributes to ER stress. We found that MT1-MMP gene silencing or pharmacological inhibition of vesicular trafficking with Brefeldin-A abrogated MT1-MMP cell surface-mediated proMMP-2 activation by the lectin Concanavalin-A (ConA) in U87 glioblastoma cells. ConA, also known to trigger the expression of pro-inflammatory cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 through MT1-MMP signalling from the plasma membrane, failed to do so when MT1-MMP was prevented from reaching the cell surface by Brefeldin-A. Gene silencing of MT1-MMP antagonized the expression of ConA-induced COX-2 and of the ER stress marker glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78), further suggesting that plasma membrane localization of MT1-MMP contributes to signalling ER stress. MT1-MMP maturation, which partially occurs during its trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane, showed correlation of the 60 kDa MT1-MMP with GRP78 expression. Finally, Brefeldin-A treatment of glioblastoma cells led to Akt dephosphorylation; this effect was reversed when MT1-MMP was silenced. Collectively, our results provide a molecular rationale for a new role for MT1-MMP in the regulation of cancer cell death processes through ER stress signalling.

Research in estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) or beta (ER beta) knockout (KO) mice suggests that ER alpha increases and ERE decreases male aggression, while the opposite is found for female ER alpha KO and ER beta KO mice. Using a detailed behavioural analysis of the resident-intruder test, we have shown that the ER beta selective agonist WAY-200070 increased agonistic behaviours, such as aggressive grooming and pushing down a gonadectomized (gonadex) intruder, in gonadally intact but not gonadex male and female resident mice, while leaving attacks unaffected. The role of acute activation of ER alpha in agonistic behaviour in adult non-KO CD1 mice is presently unknown. The current study assesses the effects of the ER alpha selective agonist 1,3,5-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-propyl-1H-pyrazole (PPT) on the social and agonistic responses of gonadally intact and gonadex male and female CD1 mice to a gonadex, same-sex intruder. PPT had few effects in gonadally intact mice, but seems to increase sex-typical aggression (i.e., attacks in males, other dominance-related behaviours in females) in gonadex mice. In untreated mice, we confirmed our previous findings that gonadally intact males attacked the intruder more than females, but females spent more time engaged in agonistic behaviour than males. As in our previous results, we observed that gonadex mice generally show behaviour patterns more like those of the gonadally intact opposite sex, while leaving overall levels of agonistic behaviour unaffected. Taken together, our current and previous results show that exogenous activation of ER had no effects in gonadally intact mice, but increased sex-typical agonistic behaviour in gonadex mice, while ER beta had no effects in gonadex mice, but increased non-attack agonistic behaviour in gonadally intact animals. This suggests that, as in social recognition, ER alpha may be necessary for the activation of agonistic responses, while ER beta may play a modulatory role. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Cross-sectional and 35-year longitudinal assessment of salivary cortisol and cognitive functioning: The Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Cortisol; HPA axis; Aging; Cognition; Cognitive aging; VETSA	EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; CUSHINGS-SYNDROME; CORTICOSTEROID RECEPTORS; ELDERLY-MEN; BRAIN; STRESS; DEPRESSION; REGISTRY; HUMANS	High levels of cortisol, a sign of potential hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, have been associated with poor cognitive outcomes in older adults. Most cortisol research has focused on hippocampal-related abilities such as episodic memory; however, the presence of glucocorticoid receptors in the human prefrontal cortex suggests that cortisol regulation is likely to be associated with prefrontally-mediated executive function abilities. We hypothesized that elevated cortisol levels would be associated with poorer frontal-executive function in addition to episodic memory. We assessed cortisol from 15 saliva samples paralleling individual diurnal rhythms across three non-consecutive days in a group of 778 middle-aged twin men ages 51-60. Cognitive domains created from 24 standard measures included: general cognitive ability, verbal and visual spatial ability, verbal and visual-spatial memory, short-term/immediate memory, working memory, executive function, verbal fluency, abstract reasoning, and psychomotor processing speed. Adjusting for general cognitive ability at age 20, age, race, and multiple health and lifestyle indicators, higher levels of average area-under-the-curve cortisol output across three days were significantly associated with poorer performance in three domains: executive (primarily set-shifting) measures, processing speed, and visual spatial memory. In a 35-year longitudinal component of the study, we also found that general cognitive ability at age 20 was a significant predictor of midlife cortisol levels. These results possibly support the notion that glucocorticoid exposure is associated with cognitive functions that are mediated by frontal striatal systems, and is not specific to hippocampal-dependent memory. The results also suggest that the direction of effect is complex. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Integration of auditory and somatosensory error signals in the neural control of speech movements. J Neurophysiol 106: 667-679, 2011. First published May 11, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00638.2010.-We investigated auditory and somatosensory feedback contributions to the neural control of speech. In task I, sensorimotor adaptation was studied by perturbing one of these sensory modalities or both modalities simultaneously. The first formant (F1) frequency in the auditory feedback was shifted up by a real-time processor and/or the extent of jaw opening was increased or decreased with a force field applied by a robotic device. All eight subjects lowered F1 to compensate for the up-shifted F1 in the feedback signal regardless of whether or not the jaw was perturbed. Adaptive changes in subjects' acoustic output resulted from adjustments in articulatory movements of the jaw or tongue. Adaptation in jaw opening extent in response to the mechanical perturbation occurred only when no auditory feedback perturbation was applied or when the direction of adaptation to the force was compatible with the direction of adaptation to a simultaneous acoustic perturbation. In tasks II and III, subjects' auditory and somatosensory precision and accuracy were estimated. Correlation analyses showed that the relationships 1) between F1 adaptation extent and auditory acuity for F1 and 2) between jaw position adaptation extent and somatosensory acuity for jaw position were weak and statistically not significant. Taken together, the combined findings from this work suggest that, in speech production, sensorimotor adaptation updates the underlying control mechanisms in such a way that the planning of vowel-related articulatory movements takes into account a complex integration of error signals from previous trials but likely with a dominant role for the auditory modality.

Interictal scalp fast oscillations as a marker of the seizure onset zone	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PAROXYSMAL FAST ACTIVITY; HUMAN EPILEPTIC BRAIN; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; 100-500 HZ; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; INTRACRANIAL EEG; IN-VIVO	Objective: This study aims to identify if oscillations at frequencies higher than the traditional EEG can be recorded on the scalp EEG of patients with focal epilepsy and to analyze the association of these oscillations with interictal discharges and the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Methods: The scalp EEG of 15 patients with focal epilepsy was studied. We analyzed the rates of gamma (40-80 Hz) and ripple (>80 Hz) oscillations, their co-occurrence with spikes, the number of channels with fast oscillations inside and outside the SOZ, and the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of gamma, ripples, and spikes to determine the SOZ. Results: Gamma and ripples frequently co-occurred with spikes (77.5% and 63% of cases). For all events, the proportion of channels with events was consistently higher inside than outside the SOZ: spikes (100% vs 70%), gamma (82% vs 33%), and ripples (48% vs 11%); p < 0.0001. The mean rates (events/min) were higher inside than outside the SOZ: spikes (2.64 +/- 1.70 vs 0.69 +/- 0.26, p = 0.02), gamma (0.77 +/- 0.71 vs 0.20 +/- 0.25, p = 0.02), and ripples (0.08 +/- 0.12 vs 0.04 +/- 0.09, p = 0.04). The sensitivity to identify the SOZ was spikes 100%, gamma 82%, and ripples 48%; the specificity was spikes 30%, gamma 68%, and ripples 89%; and the accuracy was spikes 43%, gamma 70%, and ripples 81%. Conclusion: The rates and the proportion of channels with gamma and ripple fast oscillations are higher inside the SOZ, indicating that they can be used as interictal scalp EEG markers for the SOZ. These fast oscillations are less sensitive but much more specific and accurate than spikes to delineate the SOZ. Neurology (R) 2011;77:524-531	[Andrade-Valenca, L.

Antibodies to MOG are transient in childhood acute disseminated encephalomyelitis	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MYELIN OLIGODENDROCYTE GLYCOPROTEIN; PEDIATRIC MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME; DEMYELINATING DISEASES; ANTIMYELIN ANTIBODIES; BASIC-PROTEIN; AUTOANTIBODIES; SPECIFICITY; CHILDREN; ASSOCIATION	Objective: To study the longitudinal dynamics of anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) autoantibodies in childhood demyelinating diseases. Methods: We addressed the kinetics of anti-MOG immunoglobulins in a prospective study comprising 77 pediatric patients. This was supplemented by a cross-sectional study analyzing 126 pediatric patients with acute demyelination and 62 adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). MOG-transfected cells were used for detection of antibodies by flow cytometry. Results: Twenty-five children who were anti-MOG immunoglobulin (Ig) positive at disease onset were followed for up to 5 years. Anti-MOG antibodies rapidly and continuously declined in all 16 monophasic patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and in one patient with clinically isolated syndrome. In contrast, in 6 of 8 patients (75%) eventually diagnosed with childhood MS, the antibodies to MOG persisted with fluctuations showing a second increase during an observation period of up to 5 years. Antibodies to MOG were mainly IgG 1 and their binding was largely blocked by pathogenic anti-MOG antibodies derived from a spontaneous animal model of autoimmune encephalitis. The cross-sectional part of our study elaborated that anti-MOG Ig was present in about 25% of children with acute demyelination, but in none of the pediatric or adult controls. Sera from 4/62 (6%) adult patients with MS had anti-MOG IgG at low levels. Conclusions: The persistence or disappearance of antibodies to MOG may have prognostic relevance for acute childhood demyelination. Neurology (R) 2011;77:580-588	[Proebstel, A.

Mandible Changes Evaluated by Computed Tomography Following Botulinum Toxin A Injections in Square-faced Patients	AESTHETIC PLASTIC SURGERY			English	Article						Botulinum toxin A; Botox; Dysport; Bony changes; Square face; Masseteric hypertrophy	MASSETER MUSCLE; HYPERTROPHY	A facial contour that is oval is more pleasing in Asian women. Patients with a square face often seek facial contouring procedures to improve their appearance. Treatment often involves various combinations of Botulinum NeuroToxin A (BoNTA) injections into the masseters and/or mandibular angle resection. Many physicians claim that muscle paralysis with injections alone will decrease pulling on the underlying bone and also treat underlying bony flaring when present. Muscular changes after BoNTA injections have been well documented. However, the effect of BoNTA injections on the underlying mandibular bone morphology has not been studied to the best of the authors' knowledge. The goal of this study was to determine whether there are mandibular changes after masseter injection with botulinum toxin. In this retrospective study of ten female patients seeking treatment for a square face, three-dimensional CT scans were taken before and 3 months after standardized BoNTA injections in bilateral masseters. Mandibular cortex thickness, mandibular bone thickness, and mandibular volume were measured. Soft-tissue changes were observed but no bony changes were observed 3 months after injections. In this study of adult patients, there were no statistically significant mandibular changes 3 months after BoNTA injection. The current theory of mandibular flaring resolution after partial muscle paralysis is not supported by our findings. Therefore, a patient presenting both masseteric hypertrophy and bony flaring will most likely require a combined muscular and bony procedure.	[Chang, C. S.; Yu, C. C.; Chen, P. K. T.; Chen, Y.

J	Szyf, M				Szyf, Moshe			The early life social environment and DNA methylation DNA methylation mediating the long-term impact of social environments early in life	EPIGENETICS			English	Review						DNA methylation; psychiatry; development; epidemiology; environment	GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; ACTIVE DEMETHYLATION; GLYCOSYLASE ACTIVITY; BDNF TRANSCRIPTION; MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; STRESS RESPONSES; GENE-REGULATION; EUKARYOTIC DNA; IN-VIVO; BRAIN	Although epidemiological data provides evidence that there is an interaction between genetics (nature) and the social and physical environments (nurture) in human development; the main open question remains the mechanism. The pattern of distribution of methyl groups in DNA is different from cell-type to cell type and is conferring cell specific identity on DNA during cellular differentiation and organogenesis. This is an innate and highly programmed process. However, recent data suggests that DNA methylation is not only involved in cellular differentiation but that it is also involved in modulation of genome function in response to signals from the physical, biological and social environments. We propose that modulation of DNA methylation in response to environmental cues early in life serves as a mechanism of life-long genome "adaptation" that molecularly embeds the early experiences of a child ("nurture") in the genome ("nature"). There is an emerging line of data supporting this hypothesis in rodents, non-human primates and humans that will be reviewed here. However, several critical questions remain including the identification of mechanisms that transmit the signals from the social environment to the DNA methylation/demethylation enzymes.

J	Lee, YA; Goto, Y				Lee, Young-A.; Goto, Yukiori			Chronic stress modulation of prefrontal cortical NMDA receptor expression disrupts limbic structure-prefrontal cortex interaction	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						limbic structure; NMDA receptor; prefrontal cortex; stress; synaptic plasticity	SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; LONG-TERM-POTENTIATION; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; FEAR EXTINCTION; IN-VIVO; RAT; DEPRESSION; BLOCKADE; NR2B; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Chronic stress causes various detrimental effects including cognitive and affective dysfunctions. Given the recent findings emphasizing the importance of information processing between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic structures on cognitive and affective functions, impairments of these functions caused by chronic stress may be associated with stress-induced adaptive and maladaptive responses in limbic structure-PFC interaction. In this study we have shown that chronic stress disrupts limbic structure-PFC interaction by modulating N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression in the PFC. We found that chronic stress decreased expression of NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors in the PFC but not in the motor cortex. However, the reduction in NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors was larger in the dorsal part than the ventral part of PFC. In agreement with this observation, administration of the NMDA antagonist that was more selective for NMDA receptors containing NR2B subunits induced alterations of synchronous local field potentials between the PFC and limbic structures, synaptic plasticity induction in the limbic structure-PFC pathway, and spike firing of PFC neurons that were similar to those observed in the dorsal PFC of rats exposed to chronic stress. In contrast, administration of the NMDA antagonist that was not subunit-selective resulted in electrophysiological alterations resembling to those observed in the ventral PFC of rats exposed to chronic stress. These results suggest that chronic stress disrupts NMDA receptor-dependent limbic structure-PFC information processing.

J	Herholz, SC; Boh, B; Pantev, C				Herholz, Sibylle C.; Boh, Bastiaan; Pantev, Christo			Musical training modulates encoding of higher-order regularities in the auditory cortex	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical plasticity; implicit learning; magnetoencephalography; mismatch negativity; musicians	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; COMPARING MUSICIANS; TIME-COURSE; NONMUSICIANS; SOUND; BRAIN; PITCH; REORGANIZATION; PLASTICITY; RESOLUTION	We investigated the effect of long-term musical training on the time course of development of neuronal representations within the auditory cortex by means of magnetoencephalography. In musicians but not in nonmusicians, pre-attentive encoding of a complex regularity within a tone sequence was evident by a constant increase of the pattern mismatch negativity within < 10 min. The group difference was more pronounced in the left hemisphere, indicating stronger plastic changes in its structures supporting temporal analysis and sound pattern encoding. The results suggest an effect of long-term musical training on short-term auditory learning processes. This has implications not only for cognitive neuroscience in showing how short-term and long-term neuronal plasticity can interact within the auditory cortex, but also for educational and clinical applications of implicit auditory learning where beneficial effects of (musical) experience might be exploited.

Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency	GENETICS IN MEDICINE			English	Review						PAH deficiency; hyperphenylalaninemia; phenylketonuria	EARLY-TREATED PHENYLKETONURIA; TETRAHYDROBIOPTERIN-RESPONSIVE PHENYLKETONURIA; ANTICIPATES DIETARY REQUIREMENTS; GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS; BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; NEUTRAL AMINO-ACIDS; IN-VITRO EXPRESSION; LONG-TERM TREATMENT; CLASSICAL PHENYLKETONURIA; MATERNAL PHENYLKETONURIA	Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in intolerance to the dietary intake of the essential amino acid phenylalanine. It occurs in approximately 1: 15,000 individuals. Deficiency of this enzyme produces a spectrum of disorders including classic phenylketonuria, mild phenylketonuria, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia. Classic phenylketonuria is caused by a complete or near-complete deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity and without dietary restriction of phenylalanine most children will develop profound and irreversible intellectual disability. Mild phenylketonuria and mild hyperphenylalaninemia are associated with lower risk of impaired cognitive development in the absence of treatment. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency can be diagnosed by newborn screening based on detection of the presence of hyperphenylalaninemia using the Guthrie microbial inhibition assay or other assays on a blood spot obtained from a heel prick. Since the introduction of newborn screening, the major neurologic consequences of hyperphenylalaninemia have been largely eradicated. Affected individuals can lead normal lives. However, recent data suggest that homeostasis is not fully restored with current therapy. Treated individuals have a higher incidence of neuropsychological problems. The mainstay of treatment for hyperphenylalaninemia involves a low-protein diet and use of a phenylalanine-free medical formula. This treatment must commence as soon as possible after birth and should continue for life. Regular monitoring of plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations is necessary. Targets of plasma phenylalanine of 120-360 mu mol/L (2-6 mg/dL) in the first decade of life are essential for optimal outcome. Phenylalanine targets in adolescence and adulthood are less clear. A significant proportion of patients with phenylketonuria may benefit from adjuvant therapy with 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin stereoisomer. Special consideration must be given to adult women with hyperphenylalaninemia because of the teratogenic effects of phenylalanine. Women with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency considering pregnancy should follow special guidelines and assure adequate energy intake with the proper proportion of protein, fat, and carbohydrates to minimize risks to the developing fetus. Molecular genetic testing of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene is available for genetic counseling purposes to determine carrier status of at-risk relatives and for prenatal testing.

The stroke susceptibility assessment based on the analysis of human movements is one of the potential avenues needing investigation. As a first step in this direction, this paper reports results on the relationship linking the most important stroke risk factors to some characteristics of human movement. Various features were extracted using the Sigma-Lognormal model on 1440 stereotypical triangular movements performed by 120 subjects having different health conditions. These features were combined through a linear modeling to maximize the predictability of presence of stroke risk factors in the studied cohort. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under this curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the clinical significance of this relationship. Using only the information derived from the movements, the six tested risk factors (cardiac problems, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity, and cigarette smoking) can be predicted with an AUC ranging from .68 to .82.

We compared oscillator-and timekeeper-based accounts of temporal coordination by examining musicians' coordination of rhythmic musical sequences with a metronome that gradually changed rate at the end of a musical phrase (Experiment 1) or at the beginning of a phrase (Experiment 2). The rhythms contained events that occurred at the same periodic rate as the metronome and at half the period. Rate change consisted of a linear increase or decrease in intervals between metronome onsets. Musicians coordinated their performances better with a metronome that decreased than increased in tempo (as predicted by an oscillator model), at both beginnings and ends of musical phrases. Model performance was tested with an oscillator period or timekeeper interval set to the same period as the metronome (1:1 coordination) or half the metronome period (2:1 coordination). Only the oscillator model was able to predict musicians' coordination at both periods. These findings suggest that coordination is based on internal neural oscillations that entrain to external sequences.

Virtual imaging laboratories for marker discovery in neurodegenerative diseases	NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEMENTIA; MCI; AD	The unprecedented growth, availability and accessibility of imaging data from people with neurodegenerative conditions has led to the development of computational infrastructures, which offer scientists access to large image databases and e-Science services such as sophisticated image analysis algorithm pipelines and powerful computational resources, as well as three-dimensional visualization and statistical tools. Scientific e-infrastructures have been and are being developed in Europe and North America that offer a suite of services for computational neuroscientists. The convergence of these initiatives represents a worldwide infrastructure that will constitute a global virtual imaging laboratory. This will provide computational neuroscientists with a virtual space that is accessible through an ordinary web browser, where image data sets and related clinical variables, algorithm pipelines, computational resources, and statistical and visualization tools will be transparently accessible to users irrespective of their physical location. Such an experimental environment will be instrumental to the success of ambitious scientific initiatives with high societal impact, such as the prevention of Alzheimer disease. In this article, we provide an overview of the currently available e-infrastructures and consider how computational neuroscience in neurodegenerative disease might evolve in the future.

Evidence for Catch-up in Cognition and Receptive Vocabulary Among Adolescents Born Very Preterm	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						very low birth weight; prematurity; cognitive development; language	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; LOW-DOSE INDOMETHACIN; INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGE; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES; EXTREME PREMATURITY; CHILDREN BORN; AGE; LANGUAGE; INFANTS	BACKGROUND: Very preterm adolescents display persistent deficits in neuropsychological functions. OBJECTIVE: To compare cognitive and language outcomes at 16 years and cognitive and receptive vocabulary trajectories throughout school years between very preterm and term children and to determine child and family factors associated with better developmental trajectories. DESIGN AND METHODS: At 8, 12, and 16 years, 322 very preterm children with birth weights of 1250 g or less and 41 term children had cognitive and language testing. Hierarchical growth-curve modeling was used to delineate the differences in cognitive and receptive vocabulary development between participants. Cluster analyses allowed for the characterization of very preterm children with different patterns of cognitive and receptive vocabulary development. RESULTS: At 16 years, very preterm adolescents had deficits in general cognition and higher-order language skills (phonological awareness and phonemic decoding) compared with term peers. Although the between-group difference in cognitive scores remained stable from 8 to 16 years, very preterm children demonstrated catch-up gains in receptive vocabulary during the same period. Moreover, subgroups of very preterm children displayed developmental trajectories in cognition similar to term children (55% on the vocabulary and 46% on the block-design subtests). These children had lower rates of neurosensory impairment and mothers with higher education and were from an ethnic nonminority. CONCLUSIONS: Significant catch-up in receptive vocabulary is observed by the age of 16 years among very preterm children compared to term peers. The absence of neurosensory impairment and residing in a favorable socioeconomic milieu are associated with the most optimal developmental trajectories.

Objective: The objective of this study was to establish target values for Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) III scoring in rehabilitation for clinically complete spinal cord lesion (SCL) neurological levels. Setting: In total, 13 spinal cord units in six countries from North America, Europe and the Middle East were taken. Methods: Total SCIM III scores and gain at discharge from rehabilitation were calculated for SCL levels in 128 patients with American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A on admission to rehabilitation. Results: Median, quartiles, mean and s.d., values of discharge SCIM III scores and SCIM III gain for the various SCL levels are presented. Total SCIM III scores and gain were significantly correlated with the SCL level (r = 0.730, r = 0.579, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Calculated discharge SCIM III scores can be used as target values for functional achievements at various neurological levels in patients after AIS A SCL. They are generally, but not always, inversely correlated with SCL level.

Yet, little is known about how the infant's brain treats such information. Here, we investigated, using electrophysiology and source analyses, how newborns process their mother's voice compared with that of a stranger. Results suggest that, shortly after birth, newborns distinctly process their mother's voice at an early preattentional level and at a later presumably cognitive level. Activation sources revealed that exposure to the maternal voice elicited early language-relevant processing, whereas the stranger's voice elicited more voice-specific responses. A central probably motor response was also observed at a later time, which may reflect an innate auditory-articulatory loop. The singularity of left-dominant brain activation pattern together with its ensuing sustained greater central activation in response to the mother's voice may provide the first neurophysiologic index of the preferential mother's role in language acquisition.

Development and initial psychometric evaluation of the Stroke Arm Ladder - a measure of upper extremity function post stroke	CLINICAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Stroke; upper extremity (arm); measurement; rasch	CANADIAN NEUROLOGICAL SCALE; EARLY SUPPORTED DISCHARGE; UPPER-LIMB FUNCTION; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BLOCK TEST; RELIABILITY; POSTSTROKE; VALIDITY; REHABILITATION; VALIDATION	Objective: To develop an adaptive measure, the Stroke Arm Ladder, to parsimoniously quantify upper extremity function post stroke. Setting: Various studies conducted in Montreal and elsewhere in Canada. Subjects: A total of 4058 persons with stroke who participated in various studies were assessed on different occasions post stroke. Assessments spanned from 3 days to 1 year post stroke. Main measures: A calibrated bank containing 49 items from tests and indices designed to assess global motor recovery of the upper extremity, upper extremity function and activities involving the upper extremity was used. Data including all testing occasions were analysed to test whether they adhered to the expectations of the Rasch partial credit model and whether item hierarchy remained stable across testing occasions. Results: Fifteen items did not meet the requirements of the Rasch model and were deleted. An adaptive measure of upper extremity function, the Stroke Arm Ladder, containing 34 items was created. The easiest item was partially executing the bilateral task of tying a scarf around one's neck, while the hardest item was being able to transfer more than 60 blocks on the Box and Block Test. The items' difficulty thresholds cover a wide range of difficulty levels from -7.4 to 6.2 and the global fit statistics (chi(2): 331; probability: 0.18), confirmed content validity. Conclusion: The Stroke Arm Ladder demonstrates adequate initial psychometric properties. Further testing of the measure in its adaptive format is necessary before it can be used clinically.

Design: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Gynecologic screening occurred at a university hospital, and neuropsychological testing took place in a university laboratory. Patient(s): Twenty-four naturally menopausal women with an intact uterus who had never used hormone therapy were recruited by means of newspaper advertisements. All completed the study. Intervention(s): A battery of mood and neuropsychological tests was administered. Women were randomly assigned to receive CEE + PL (n = 7), CEE + MPA (n = 9), or CEE + MP (n = 8). The tests were readministered 12 weeks later. Main Outcome Measure(s): Standardized tests of mood, verbal memory, working memory, spatial abilities, and visual-spatial sequencing, and assays of serum sex hormone levels. Result(s): Mood improved after treatment in all groups. No changes in scores occurred over time in any cognitive test in the group that received CEE + PL. Only the CEE + MP group had a significant decrease in their delayed verbal memory scores from baseline to after treatment. The CEE + MP-treated women performed significantly better on a test of working memory than women in the other two groups. Conclusion(s): Coadministration of CEE with MPA or MP caused differential effects on aspects of memory in postmenopausal women. These findings need to be replicated with a larger sample size before their potential clinical implications can be determined. (Fertil Steril (R) 2011;96:399-403.

All children ages 8 to 17 years old presenting to an emergency department in 2008 who were treated for status migrainosus and discharged home were included. Of the total of 187 patients, 21 patients (11.2%) bounced back. Treatment given was not associated with the bounce back rate. The only factors reaching significance were the presence of a migraine equivalent in 28.6% of patients who bounced back as compared with only 6.7% in patients without recurrence (P = .006); brain imaging study in the emergency department (52.4% vs 16.9%, P =.001); and an arranged physician follow-up (66.6% vs 36.3%, P =.01). The results appear to suggest that no current treatment given to children presenting to the emergency department with status migrainosus seems to alter the immediate recurrence rate.

The Impact of Specialized Centers of Care for Spinal Cord Injury on Length of Stay, Complications, and Mortality: A Systematic Review of the Literature	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Review						hospitalization; spinal cord injury; systematic review	TRAUMA CENTER; EARLY ADMISSION; MANAGEMENT; EXPERIENCE; RECOVERY; BENEFITS; VOLUME	Specialized centers of care for spinal cord injury (SCI) were first established in 1944 in England. The objective of these centers is to improve care and neurological recovery of patients suffering from a spinal cord injury. An interdisciplinary group of experts composed of medical and surgical specialists treating patients with SCI formulated the following questions: (1) Is there any evidence to suggest that specialized centers of care in SCI decrease the length of patient stay? and (2) Is there evidence that specialized centers of care for SCI reduce mortality and secondary complications? A systematic review of the current evidence was performed using multiple databases to answer these two specific questions. Two independent reviewers graded each paper using the Black and Downs method. Recommendations were then formulated based on the evidence available and were reviewed by a panel of experts using a modified Delphi approach. Two recommendations were formulated and both received complete agreement from a panel of experts. The first recommendation is "Early transfer of a patient with traumatic SCI to a specialized center of care should be done promptly to decrease overall length of stay.'' The second recommendation is "Early transfer of patients with traumatic SCI to an integrated multidisciplinary specialized center of care decreases overall mortality, and the number and severity of complications.''

The use of MRI for imaging in the acute management of patients with spinal cord injury has increased significantly. This paper used a vigorous literature review with Downs and Black scoring, followed by a Delphi vote on the main conclusions. MRI is strongly recommended for the prognostication of acute spinal cord injury. The sagittal T2 sequence was particularly found to be of value. Four prognostication patterns were found to be predictive of neurological outcome (normal, single-level edema, multi-level edema, and mixed hemorrhage and edema). It is recommended that MRI be used to direct clinical decision making. MRI has a role in clearance, the ruling out of injury, of the cervical spine in the obtunded patient only if there is abnormality of the neurological exam. Patients with cervical spinal cord injuries have an increased risk of vertebral artery injuries but the literature does not allow for recommendation of magnetic resonance angiography as part of the routine protocol. Finally, time repetition (TR) and time echo (TE) values used to evaluate patients with acute spinal cord injury vary significantly. All publications with MRI should specify the TR and TE values used.

An interdisciplinary group of experts composed of medical and surgical specialists treating patients with SCI formulated the following questions: 1) What is the epidemiology of pediatric spinal cord injury and fractures?; 2) Are there unique features of pediatric SCI which distinguish the pediatric SCI population from adult SCI?; 3) Is there evidence to support the use of neuroprotective approaches, including hypothermia and steroids, in the treatment of pediatric SCI? A systematic review of the literature using multiple databases was undertaken to evaluate these three specific questions. A search strategy composed of specific search terms (Spinal Cord Injury, Paraplegia, Quadriplegia, tetraplegia, lapbelt injuries, seatbelt injuries, cervical spine injuries and Pediatrics) returned over 220 abstracts that were evaluated and by two observers. Relevant abstracts were then evaluated and papers were graded using the Downs and Black method. A table of evidence was then presented to a panel of experts using a modified Delphi approach and the following recommendation was then formulated using a consensus approach: Pediatric patients with traumatic SCI have different mechanisms of injury and have a better neurological recovery potential when compared to adults. Patients with SCI before their adolescent growth spurt have a high likelihood of developing scoliosis. Because of these differences, traumatic SCI should be highly suspected in the presence of abnormal neck or neurological exam, a high-risk mechanism of injury or a distracting injury even in the absence of radiological anomaly.

In rodents, pharmacological vitamin K deficiency has resulted in behavioral perturbations. To gain insight on the role of vitamin K status on brain function, we investigated learning abilities (Morris water maze), motor activity (open field), and anxiety (elevated plus maze) in distinct groups of 6-, 12-, and 20-mo-old female Sprague-Dawley rats that had been fed diets containing low (L; similar to 80 mu g/kg diet), adequate (A; similar to 500 mu g/kg diet), or high (H; similar to 2000 mu g/kg diet) levels of phylloquinone (mu g/kg diet; n = 9-12/diet) since weaning. In 20-mo-old rats, sphingolipids (cerebroside, sulfatide, sphingomyelin, ceramide, and gangliosides), phylloquinone, and menaquinone-4 were also assessed in cerebellum, midbrain, pons medulla, striatum, and hippocampus. Lifetime consumption of a low-vitamin K diet resulted in cognitive deficits in the 20-mo-old rats, with those in the L group having longer latencies than those in the H group (P < 0.05); this was associated with higher concentrations of ceramides in the hippocampus (P < 0.05) and lower gangliosides in the pons medulla and midbrain (P < 0.05). The low-vitamin K diet did not affect cognition at 6 and 12 mo of age, nor did it affect motor activity or anxiety at any age. Although much remains to be elucidated about the mechanism of action of vitamin K in cognition, this report points to vitamin K as an important nutritional factor contributing to cognitive health during aging.

We aimed at reviewing studies exploring dysfunctional cognitive processes, and their neuroanatomical basis, in suicidal behaviour, and to develop a neurocognitive working model. Methods. A literature search was conducted. Results. Several limitations were found. The main reported neuropsychological findings are a higher attention to specific negative emotional stimuli, impaired decision-making, lower problem-solving abilities, reduced verbal fluency, and possible reduced non-specific attention and reversal learning in suicide attempters. Neuroimaging studies mainly showed the involvement of ventrolateral orbital, dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and, to a lesser extent, the amygdala. In addition, alterations in white matter connections are suggested. Conclusions. These studies support the concept of alterations in suicidal behaviour distinct from those of comorbid disorders. We propose that a series of neurocognitive dysfunctions, some with trait-like characteristics, may facilitate the development of a suicidal crisis during stressful circumstances: (1) an altered modulation of value attribution, (2) an inadequate regulation of emotional and cognitive responses, and (3) a facilitation of acts in an emotional context. This preliminary model may represent a framework for the design of future studies on the pathophysiology, prediction and prevention of these complex human behaviours.

Data on all incident GBS cases meeting the Brighton Collaboration criteria that were diagnosed at 25 neurology centers in France were prospectively collected between March 2007 and June 2010, covering 3 influenzavirus seasons, including the 2009-2010 A/H1N1 outbreak. A total of 457 general practitioners provided a registry of patients from which 1,080 controls were matched by age, gender, index date (calendar month), and region to 145 cases. Causal relations were assessed by multivariate case-control analysis with adjustment for risk factors (personal and family history of autoimmune disorders, among others), while matching on age, gender, and calendar time. Influenza (seasonal or A/H1N1) or influenzalike symptoms in the 2 months preceding the index date was associated with GBS, with a matched odds ratio of 2.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7, 8.2). The difference in the rates of GBS occurring between influenza virus circulation periods and noncirculation periods was highly statistically significant (P = 0.004). Adjusted odds ratios for GBS occurrence within 6 weeks after seasonal and A/H1N1 vaccination were 1.3 (95% CI: 0.4, 4.1) and 0.9 (95% CI: 0.1, 7.6), respectively. Study results confirm that influenza virus is a likely risk factor for GBS. Conversely, no new concerns have arisen regarding influenza vaccination.

An Analysis of Comfort Medications Delivered to Dying Neonates	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS			English	Article							END-OF-LIFE; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; PALLIATIVE CARE; CIRCUMSTANCES; INFANTS; DEATHS; DRUGS	Objectives To clarify the use of end-of-life comfort medications or neuromuscular blockers (NMBs) in culturally different neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Study design Review of medical files of newborns > 22 weeks gestation who died in the delivery room or the NICU during 12 months in four NICUs (Chicago, Milwaukee, Montreal, and Groningen). We compared use of end-of-life comfort medications and NMBs. Results None of the babies who died in the delivery room received comfort medications. The use of opiods (77%) or benzodiazepines (41%) around death was similar in all NICUs. Increasing this medication around extubation occurred most often in Montreal, rarely in Milwaukee and Groningen, and never in Chicago. Comfort medications use had no significant impact on the time between extubation and death. NMBs were never used around death in Chicago, once in Montreal, and more frequently in Milwaukee and Groningen. Initiation of NMB after extubation occurred only in Groningen. Conclusion Comfort medications were administered to almost all dying infants in each NICU. Some, but not all, centers were comfortable increasing these medications around or after extubation. In three centers, NMBs were at times present at the time of death. However, only in Holland were NMBs initiated after extubation. (J Pediatr 2011; 159: 206-10).	[Verhagen, A. A.

Systematic resequencing of X-chromosome synaptic genes in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; schizophrenia; X chromosome; synaptic genes; rare variants	LINKED MENTAL-RETARDATION; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE-B; GENOMEWIDE SCREEN; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; POSTSYNAPTIC DENSITY; ANGELMAN SYNDROME; PROTEIN FAMILY; MUTATIONS; ASSOCIATION	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are two common neurodevelopmental syndromes that result from the combined effects of environmental and genetic factors. We set out to test the hypothesis that rare variants in many different genes, including de novo variants, could predispose to these conditions in a fraction of cases. In addition, for both disorders, males are either more significantly or more severely affected than females, which may be explained in part by X-linked genetic factors. Therefore, we directly sequenced 111 X-linked synaptic genes in individuals with ASD (n = 142; 122 males and 20 females) or SCZ (n = 143; 95 males and 48 females). We identified > 200 non-synonymous variants, with an excess of rare damaging variants, which suggest the presence of disease-causing mutations. Truncating mutations in genes encoding the calcium-related protein IL1RAPL1 (already described in Piton et al. Hum Mol Genet 2008) and the monoamine degradation enzyme monoamine oxidase B were found in ASD and SCZ, respectively. Moreover, several promising non-synonymous rare variants were identified in genes encoding proteins involved in regulation of neurite outgrowth and other various synaptic functions (MECP2, TM4SF2/TSPAN7, PPP1R3F, PSMD10, MCF2, SLITRK2, GPRASP2, and OPHN1).

Rats were injected with ((3)H) labelled alpha-methyl-l-tryptophan and the tracer distribution was measured using the autoradiographic method 14 days following the injection. In a separate experiment, the total brain concentration of 5-HT in the rat brain was found to be 2.4 +/- A 0.2 nmol/g. Based on this, and the assumption that the specific activity of in situ produced alpha-methyl-serotonin is the same as that of the injected tracer, it was possible to estimate the regional concentrations of 5-HT and the relative concentration of regional serotonergic innervations. It was found, and reported for the first time here, that the highest concentration of serotonergic innervation is present in the solitary nucleus. Regionally measured 5-HT concentrations accord well with previously reported concentrations of 5-HT.

Twenty studies published from 2002 to 2008 were identified, describing the statistically significant regulation of 2254 genes. Of those, a total of 79 genes were found to be statistically significant "hits" in 4 or more independent microarray experiments, corresponding to a conservative P < 0.01 overall. Gene ontology-based functional annotation clustering analyses revealed strong evidence for regulation of immune-related genes in pain states. A multi-gene quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiment was run on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord tissue from rats and mice given nerve (sciatic chronic constriction; CCI) or inflammatory (complete Freund's adjuvant) injury. We independently confirmed the regulation of 43 of these genes in the rat-CCI-DRG condition; the genetic correlates in all other conditions were largely and, in some cases, strikingly, independent. However, a handful of genes were identified whose regulation bridged etiology, anatomical locus, and/or species. Most notable among these were Reg3b (regenerating islet-derived 3 beta; pancreatitis-associated protein) and Ccl2 (chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2), which were significantly upregulated in every condition in the rat.

This study aimed at identifying neuroanatomical correlates of impulsive aggression in healthy children. Methods: Data from 193 representative 6- to 18-year-old healthy children were obtained from the National Institutes of Health Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of Normal Brain Development after a blinded quality control. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were obtained with automated software. Aggression levels were measured with the Aggressive Behavior scale (AGG) of the Child Behavior Checklist. AGG scores were regressed against cortical thickness and basal ganglia volumes using first-and second-order linear models while controlling for age, gender, scanner site, and total brain volume. Gender by AGG interactions were analyzed. Results: There were positive associations between bilateral striatal volumes and AGG scores (right: r = .238, p = .001; left: r = .188, p = .01). A significant association was found with right ACC and subgenual ACC cortical thickness in a second-order linear model (p < .05, corrected). High AGG scores were associated with a relatively thin right ACC cortex. An AGG by gender interaction trend was found in bilateral OFC and ACC associations with AGG scores. Conclusions: This study shows the existence of relationships between impulsive aggression in healthy children and the structure of the striatum and right ACC. It also suggests the existence of gender-specific patterns of association in OFC/ACC gray matter. These results may guide research on oppositional-defiant and conduct disorders.

These methods allow for distinct features to be computed, which in turn reflect properties of fibrous tissue in the brain and in other organs. A practical consideration is that to choose among these approaches requires very specialized knowledge. In order to bridge the gap between theory and practice in dMRI reconstruction and analysis we present a detailed review of the dMRI modeling literature. We place an emphasis on the mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings of the subject, categorizing existing methods according to how they treat the angular and radial sampling of the diffusion signal. We describe the features that can be computed with each method and discuss its advantages and limitations. We also provide a detailed bibliography to guide the reader. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Non-invasive examination of white matter fibers in the living SC can be conducted using magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging. However, this technique is challenging at the spinal level due to the small cross-sectional size of the cord and the presence of physiological motion and susceptibility artifacts. In this study, we acquired in vivo high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data at 3T in cats submitted to partial SC injury. Cats were imaged before. 3 and 21 days after injury. Spatial resolution was enhanced to 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 mm(3) using super-resolution technique and distortions were corrected using the reversed gradient method. Tractography-derived regions of interest were generated in the dorsal, ventral, right and left quadrants. to evaluate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Q-Ball imaging metrics with regards to their sensitivity in detecting primary and secondary lesions. A three-way ANOVA tested the effect of session (intact, D3, D21), cross-sectional region (left, right, dorsal and ventral) and rostrocaudal location. Significant effect of session was found for FA (P<0.001), GFA (P<0.05) and radial diffusivity (P<0.001). Post-hoc paired T-test corrected for multiple comparisons showed significant changes at the lesion epicenter (P<0.005). More interestingly, significant changes were also found several centimeters from the lesion epicenter at both 3 and 21 days. This decrease was specific to the type of fibers, i.e.. rostrally to the lesion on the dorsal aspect of the cord and caudally to the lesion ipsilaterally, suggesting the detection of Wallerian degeneration.

Josef Klingler's Models of White Matter Tracts: Influences on Neuroanatomy, Neurosurgery, and Neuroimaging	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Diffusion tensor imaging; Functional neurosurgery; History of neurosurgery; Josef Klingler; Neuroanatomy; University of Basel; White matter tracts	FIBER DISSECTION TECHNIQUE; TEMPORAL-LOBE; OPTIC RADIATIONS; BRAIN; ANATOMY	During the 1930s, white matter tracts began to assume relevance for neurosurgery, especially after Cajal's work. In many reviews of white matter neurobiology, the seminal contributions of Josef Klingler (1888-1963) and their neurological applications have been overlooked. In 1934 at the University of Basel under Eugen Ludwig, Klingler developed a new method of dissection based on a freezing technique for brain tissue that eloquently revealed the white matter tracts. Klingler worked with anatomists, surgeons, and other scientists, and his models and dissections of white matter tracts remain arguably the most elegant ever created. He stressed 3-dimensional anatomic relationships and laid the foundation for defining mesial temporal, limbic, insular, and thalamic fiber and functional relationships and contributed to the potential of stereotactic neurosurgery. Around 1947, Klingler was part of a Swiss-German group that independently performed the first stereotactic thalamotomies, basing their targeting and logic on Klingler's white matter studies, describing various applications of stereotaxy and showing Klingler's work integrated into a craniocerebral topographic system for targeting with external localization of eloquent brain structures and stimulation of deep thalamic nuclei. Klingler's work has received renewed interest because it is applicable for correlating the results of the fiber-mapping paradigms from diffusion tensor imaging to actual anatomic evidence. Although others have described white matter tracts, none have had as much practical impact on neuroscience as Klinger's work. More importantly, Josef Klingler was an encouraging mentor, influencing neurosurgeons, neuroscientists, and brain imaging for more than three quarters of a century.

We conducted a longitudinal study of 192 Chinese adolescents. In 10th grade, the adolescents were tested for their affective decision-making ability using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and working memory capacity using the Self-ordered Pointing Test (SOPT). Questionnaires were used to assess perceived parent-child engagement in decision-making, academic performance and drinking behavior. At one-year follow-up, the same neuropsychological tasks and questionnaires were repeated. Results indicate that working memory and academic performance were uninfluenced by parent-child engagement in decision-making. However, compared to adolescents whose parents made solitary decisions for them, adolescents engaged in everyday decision-making showed significant improvement on affective decision capacity and significantly less binge-drinking one year later. These findings suggest that parental engagement of children in everyday decision-making might foster the development of neurocognitive functioning relative to affective decision-making and reduce adolescent substance use behaviors.

The computational model permits generation of synthetic data to assist in the evaluation of new algorithms for epilepsy treatment via adaptive neurostimulation. The model implements both single-compartment pyramidal neurons and fast-spiking interneurons, arranged in a one-dimensional network using both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The model tracks changes in extracellular ion concentrations, which determine the reversal potentials of membrane currents. Changes in simulated ion concentration provide positive feedback which drives the system towards the epileptiform state. One mechanism of positive feedback explored by this model is the conversion of pyramidal cells from regular spiking to intrinsic bursting as extracellular potassium concentration increases. One of the main contributions of this work is the development of a slow depression mechanism that enforces seizure termination. The network spontaneously leaves the seizure-like state as the slow depression variable decreases. This is one of the first detailed computational models of epileptiform activity, which exhibits realistic transitions between inter-seizure and seizure states, and back, with state durations similar to the in vitro model. We validate the computational model by comparing its state durations to those of the biological model. We also show that electrical stimulation of the computational model achieves seizure suppression comparable to that observed in the in vitro model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we investigated the complex effects of auditory-focused attention and the signal-to-noise ratio of sound stimuli on three different auditory evoked field components (auditory steady-state response, N1m, and sustained field) by means of magnetoencephalography. The results indicate that the auditory steady-state response originating in primary auditory cortex reflects the signal-to-noise ratio of physical sound inputs (bottom-up process) rather than the listener's attentional state (top-down process), whereas the sustained field, originating in nonprimary auditory cortex, reflects the attentional state rather than the signal-to-noise ratio. The N1m was substantially influenced by both bottom-up and top-down neural processes. The differential sensitivity of the components to bottom-up and top-down neural processes, contingent on their level in the processing pathway, suggests a stream from bottom-up driven sensory neural processing to top-down driven auditory perception within human auditory cortex.

However, the role of developmental vision in the elaboration of a finger numeral representation remains unexplored. In the current study, 14 congenitally blind children and 14 matched sighted controls undertook three different test batteries that examined (a) general cognitive abilities, (b) the spontaneous use of finger-counting and finger-montring strategies (where "finger-montring" is a term used to characterize the way people raise their fingers to show numerosities to other people), and (c) the canonicity level of the finger-counting and finger-montring habits. Compared with sighted controls, blind children used their fingers less spontaneously to count and in a less canonical way to count and show quantities. These results demonstrate that the absence of vision precludes the development of a typical finger numeral representation and suggest that the use of canonical finger-counting and finger-montring strategies relies on the visual recognition of particular hand shapes.

The present study further investigated the role of Am in the maintenance of morphine tolerance, morphine-associated hyperalgesia and its cellular mechanisms. Intrathecal (it.) injection of morphine for 6 days induced a decline of its analgesic effect and hyperalgesia. Acute administration of the AM receptor antagonist AM(22-52) resumed the potency of morphine in a dose-dependent manner (12, 35.8 and 71.5 mu g, i.t.). The AM(22-52) treatment also suppressed morphine tolerance-associated hyperalgesia. Furthermore, i.t. administration of AM(22-52) at a dose of 35.8 mu g reversed the morphine induced-enhancement of nNOS (neuronal nitric oxide synthase) and CGRP immunoreactivity in the spinal dorsal horn and/or dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Interestingly, chronic administration of morphine reduced the expression of the endogenous opioid peptide bovine adrenal medulla 22 (BAM22) in small- and medium-sized neurons in DRG and this reduction was partially reversed by the administration of AM(22-52) (35.814). These results suggest that the activation of AM receptors was involved in the maintenance of morphine tolerance mediating by not only upregulation of the pronociceptive mediators, nNOS and CGRP but also the down-regulation of pain-inhibiting molecule BAM22. Our data support the hypothesis that the level of both pronociceptive mediators and endogenous pain-inhibiting molecules has an impact on the potency of morphine analgesia. Targeting AM receptors is a promising approach to maintain the potency of morphine analgesia during chronic use of this drug. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Rat Grimace Scale: A partially automated method for quantifying pain in the laboratory rat via facial expressions	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article							NEUROPATHIC PAIN; HYPERALGESIA; LAPAROTOMY; PARADIGM; MODEL; ASSAY	We recently demonstrated the utility of quantifying spontaneous pain in mice via the blinded coding of facial expressions. As the majority of preclinical pain research is in fact performed in the laboratory rat, we attempted to modify the scale for use in this species. We present herein the Rat Grimace Scale, and show its reliability, accuracy, and ability to quantify the time course of spontaneous pain in the intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant, intraarticular kaolin-carrageenan, and laparotomy (post-operative pain) assays. The scale's ability to demonstrate the dose-dependent analgesic efficacy of morphine is also shown. In addition, we have developed software, Rodent Face Finder (R), which successfully automates the most labor-intensive step in the process. Given the known mechanistic dissociations between spontaneous and evoked pain, and the primacy of the former as a clinical problem, we believe that widespread adoption of spontaneous pain measures such as the Rat Grimace Scale might lead to more successful translation of basic science findings into clinical application.

The effect of propranolol and midazolam on the reconsolidation of a morphine place preference in chronically treated rats	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reconsolidation; memory; reinforcement; place preference; morphine; midazolam; propranolol; drug dependence		A stable memory can be disrupted if amnestic treatment is applied in conjunction with memory reactivation. Recent findings in the conditioned place preference (CPP) model suggest that blocking reconsolidation attenuates the ability of environmental cues to induce craving and relapse in drug addicts, but the impact of prior physical dependence has not been described. We examined the effect of post-reactivation amnestic treatment on reconsolidation of a CPP for morphine, in animals naive to morphine, under chronic morphine experience or abstinent. Chronic morphine experience was induced by escalating doses of morphine from 10 mg/kg/day (s.c.), and maintained on 30 mg/kg/day during the course of conditioning and reactivation procedures, or conditioning alone. Naive and morphine-experienced animals were trained in a three-compartment apparatus by four morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) and four saline experiences paired with either of two large conditioning compartments. The memory was then reactivated by a CPP test, and immediately afterward animals received an injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg, s.c.), the GABAa agonist midazolam (1 mg/kg, i.p.), or saline. Morphine-naive rats received only a single reconsolidation-blocking treatment (Experiment 1), while chronic morphine rats were given eight reactivation sessions each followed by amnestic treatment, either before (Experiment 2) or after 10 days of withdrawal (Experiment 3). Propranolol and midazolam disrupted reconsolidation in morphine-naive rats, but failed to disrupt the CPP when rats were trained under chronic morphine treatment, even if they were recovered from chronic opiate exposure before reactivation. In fact, propranolol increased the preference for the drug-paired context in animals trained while maintained on chronic morphine. Midazolam had little effect. Morphine experience may produce neurochemical changes which alter memory storage processes and reduce the impact of amnestic treatments on reconsolidation.	[Robinson, Michael J.

While neurons and glia have been implicated in these functional changes, it remains largely underexplored whether the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) is also involved. The BSCB is an important component in the CNS homeostasis, and compromised BSCB has been associated with different pathologies affecting the spinal cord. Here, we demonstrated that a remote injury on the peripheral nerve in rats triggered a leakage of the BSCB, which was independent of spinal microglial activation. The increase of BSCB permeability to different size tracers, such as Evans Blue and sodium fluorescein, was restricted to the lumbar spinal cord and prominent for at least 4 weeks after injury. The spinal inflammatory reaction triggered by nerve injury was a key player in modulating BSCB permeability. We identified MCP-1 as an endogenous trigger for the BSCB leakage. BSCB permeability can also be impaired by circulating IL-1 beta. In contrast, antiinflammatory cytokines TGF-beta 1 and IL-10 were able to shut down the openings of the BSCB following nerve injury. Peripheral nerve injury caused a decrease in tight junction and caveolae-associated proteins. Interestingly, ZO-1 and occludin, but not caveolin-1, were rescued by TGF-beta 1. Furthermore, our data provide direct evidence that disrupted BSCB following nerve injury contributed to the influx of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of spinal blood borne monocytes/macrophages, which played a major role in the development of neuropathic pain. These findings highlight the importance of inflammation in BSCB integrity and in spinal cord homeostasis.

J	Karama, S; Armony, J; Beauregard, M				Karama, Sherif; Armony, Jorge; Beauregard, Mario			Film Excerpts Shown to Specifically Elicit Various Affects Lead to Overlapping Activation Foci in a Large Set of Symmetrical Brain Regions in Males	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELF-INDUCED SADNESS; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BASIC EMOTIONS; FMRI; METAANALYSIS; MODULATION; IMITATION; HAPPINESS	While the limbic system theory continues to be part of common scientific parlance, its validity has been questioned on multiple grounds. Nonetheless, the issue of whether or not there exists a set of brain areas preferentially dedicated to emotional processing remains central within affective neuroscience. Recently, a widespread neural reference space for emotion which includes limbic as well as other regions was characterized in a large meta-analysis. As methodologically heterogeneous studies go into such meta-analyses, showing in an individual study in which all parameters are kept constant, the involvement of overlapping areas for various emotion conditions in keeping with the neural reference space for emotion, would serve as valuable confirmatory evidence. Here, using fMRI, 20 young adult men were scanned while viewing validated neutral and effective emotion-eliciting short film excerpts shown to quickly and specifically elicit disgust, amusement, or sexual arousal. Each emotion-specific run included, in random order, multiple neutral and emotion condition blocks. A stringent conjunction analysis revealed a large overlap across emotion conditions that fit remarkably well with the neural reference space for emotion. This overlap included symmetrical bilateral activation of the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, the temporo-occipital junction, the basal ganglia, the brainstem, the amygdala, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the subthalamic nucleus, the posterior hypothalamus, the cerebellum, as well as the frontal operculum extending towards the anterior insula. This study clearly confirms for the visual modality, that processing emotional stimuli leads to widespread increases in activation that cluster within relatively confined areas, regardless of valence.

Smpd3 encodes a neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase2), which cleaves sphingomyelin to generate bioactive lipid metabolites. We examined endochondral ossification in embryonic day 15.5 fro/fro mouse embryos and observed impaired apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes and severely undermineralized cortical bones in the developing skeleton. In a recent study, it was suggested that nSMase2 activity in the brain regulates skeletal development through endocrine factors. However, we detected Smpd3 expression in both embryonic and postnatal skeletal tissues in wild-type mice. To investigate whether nSMase2 plays a cell-autonomous role in these tissues, we examined the in vitro mineralization properties of fro/fro osteoblast cultures. fro/fro cultures mineralized less than the control osteoblast cultures. We next generated fro/fro; Col1a1-Smpd3 mice, in which osteoblast-specific expression of Smpd3 corrected the bone abnormalities observed in fro/fro embryos without affecting the cartilage phenotype. Our data suggest tissue-specific roles for nSMase2 in skeletal tissues.

In a previous study we have shown that the cholinergic axonal segments which were in the microproximity with dopaminergic fibers possessed a greater density of en passant varicosities compared to more distant segments, suggesting an activity-dependent level of en passant varicosities in the axonal zone of interaction. To further evaluate this plastic relationship, the density of cholinergic varicosities was quantified on fiber segments within the microproximity of activated or non-activated pyramidal cells of the prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Repetitive 14 days patterned visual stimulation paired with an electrical stimulation of the cholinergic fibers projecting to the mPFC from the HDB was performed to induce persistent axonal plastic changes. The c-Fos early gene immunoreactivity was used as a neuronal activity marker of layer V pyramidal cells, labelled with anti-glutamate transporter EAAC1. Cholinergic fibers were labeled with anti-ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) immunostaining. The density of ChAT+ varicosities on and the length of fiber segments within the 3 mu m microproximity of c-Fos positive/negative pyramidal cells were evaluated on confocal images. More than 50% of the pyramidal cells in the mPFC were c-Fos immunoreactive. Density of ChAT+ varicosities was significantly increased within 3 mu m vicinity of activated pyramidal cells (0.50 +/- 0.01 per mu m of ChAT+ fiber length) compared to non-activated cells in this group (0.34 +/- 0.001; p <= 0.05) or control rats (0.32 +/- 0.02; p <= 0.05). Different types of stimulation (visual, HDB or visual/HDB) induced similar increase of the density of ChAT+ varicosities within microproximity of activated pyramidal cells. This study demonstrated at the subcellular level an activity-dependent enrichment of ChAT+ varicosities in the axonal zone of interaction with other neuronal elements.

Somatic genetic abnormalities affecting this pathway occur in the majority of pilocytic astrocytomas (PA), the most prevalent brain neoplasm in children. We investigated whether OIS is induced in PA. Experimental Design: We tested expression of established senescence markers in three independent cohorts of sporadic PA. We also assessed for OIS in vitro, using forced expression of wild-type and V600E-mutant BRAF in two astrocytic cell lines: human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized astrocytes and fetal astrocytes. Results: Our results indicate that PAs are senescent as evidenced by marked senescence-associated acidic beta-galactosidase activity, low KI-67 index, and induction of p16(INK4a) but not p53 in the majority of 52 PA samples (46 of 52; 88.5%). Overexpression of a number of senescence-associated genes [CDKN2A (p16), CDKN1A (p21), CEBPB, GADD45A, and IGFBP7] was shown at the mRNA level in two independent PA tumor series. In vitro, sustained activation of wild-type or mutant BRAF induced OIS in both astrocytic cell lines. Loss of p16(INK4a) in immortalized astrocytes abrogated OIS, indicative of the role of this pathway in mediating this phenomenon in astrocytes. OIS is a mechanism of tumor suppression that restricts the progression of benign tumors. We show that it is triggered in PAs through p16(INK4a) pathway induction following aberrant MAPK activation. Conclusions: OIS may account for the slow growth pattern in PA, the lack of progression to higher-grade astrocytomas, and the high overall survival of affected patients.

Wnt5a is a cell-extrinsic factor that supports self-renewal of mouse spermatogonial stem cells	JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE			English	Article						Germline; Stem cells; Wnt signaling; Mouse	BETA-CATENIN; STEM/PROGENITOR CELLS; WNT/BETA-CATENIN; UNDIFFERENTIATED SPERMATOGONIA; SIGNALING PROMOTES; FATE DETERMINATION; GERM-CELLS; IN-VITRO; PROTEIN; EXPRESSION	The maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) provides the foundation for life-long spermatogenesis. Although glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 are crucial for self-renewal of SSCs, recent studies have suggested that other growth factors have important roles in controlling SSC fate. Because beta-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling promotes self-renewal of various stem cell types, we hypothesized that this pathway contributes to SSC maintenance. Using transgenic reporter mice for beta-catenin-dependent signaling, we found that this signaling was not active in SSCs in vitro and in most spermatogonia in vivo. Nonetheless, a pan-Wnt antagonist significantly reduced SSC activity in vitro, suggesting that some Wnt molecules exist in our serum-free culture system and contribute to SSC maintenance. Here, we report that Wnt5a promotes SSC activity. We found that Wnt5a-expressing fibroblasts supported SSC activity better than those not expressing Wnt5a in culture, and that recombinant Wnt5a stimulated SSC maintenance. Furthermore, Wnt5a promoted SSC survival in the absence of feeder cells, and this effect was abolished by inhibiting the Jun N-terminal kinase cascade. In addition, Wnt5a blocked beta-catenin-dependent signaling. We detected the expression of Wnt5a and potential Wnt5a receptors in Sertoli cells and stem/progenitor spermatogonia, respectively. These results indicate that Wnt5a is a cell-extrinsic factor that supports SSC self-renewal through beta-catenin-independent mechanisms.

Some ligands are coexpressed in cis with their receptors, raising the question of the relative contribution of cis and trans interactions to axon guidance. Spinal motor axons use Eph receptors to select a limb trajectory in response to trans ephrins, while expressing ephrins in cis. We show that changes in motor neuron ephrin expression result in trajectory selection defects mirrored by changes in growth cone sensitivity to ephrins in vitro, arguing for ephrin cis-attenuation of Eph function. Furthermore, the relative contribution of trans-signaling and cis-attenuation is influenced by the subcellular distribution of ephrins to membrane patches containing Eph receptors. Thus, growth cone ephrins are essential for axon guidance in vivo and the balance between cis and trans modes of axon guidance ligand-receptor interaction contributes to the diversity of axon guidance signaling responses.

However, how these periodicities are represented in the brain remains largely unknown. Here, we test whether this function emerges from the entrainment of neurons resonating to the beat and meter. We recorded the electroencephalogram while participants listened to a musical beat and imagined a binary or a ternary meter on this beat (i.e., a march or a waltz). We found that the beat elicits a sustained periodic EEG response tuned to the beat frequency. Most importantly, we found that meter imagery elicits an additional frequency tuned to the corresponding metric interpretation of this beat. These results provide compelling evidence that neural entrainment to beat and meter can be captured directly in the electroencephalogram. More generally, our results suggest that music constitutes a unique context to explore entrainment phenomena in dynamic cognitive processing at the level of neural networks.

Mutations in a novel serine protease PRSS56 in families with nanophthalmos	MOLECULAR VISION			English	Article							MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; FRIZZLED-RELATED PROTEIN; ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA; MFRP GENE MUTATION; POSTERIOR MICROPHTHALMOS; RETINITIS-PIGMENTOSA; LINKAGE ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; FOVEOSCHISIS; HYPEROPIA	Purpose: Nanophthalmos is a rare genetic ocular disorder in which the eyes of affected individuals are abnormally small. Patients suffer from severe hyperopia as a result of their markedly reduced axial lengths, but otherwise are capable of seeing well unlike other more general forms of microphthalmia. To date one gene for nanophthalmos has been identified, encoding the membrane-type frizzled related protein MFRP. Identification of additional genes for nanophthalmos will improve our understanding of normal developmental regulation of eye growth. Methods: We ascertained a cohort of families from eastern Canada and Mexico with familial nanophthalmos. We performed high density microsatellite and high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping to identify potential chromosomal regions of linkage. We sequenced coding regions of genes in the linked interval by traditional PCR-based Sanger capillary electrophoresis methods. We cloned and sequenced a novel cDNA from a putative causal gene to verify gene structure. Results: We identified a linked locus on chromosome 2q37 with a peak logarithm (base 10) of odds (LOD) score of 4.7. Sequencing of coding exons of all genes in the region identified multiple segregating variants in one gene, recently annotated as serine protease gene (PRSS56), coding for a predicted trypsin serine protease-like protein. One of our families was homozygous for a predicted pathogenic missense mutation, one family was compound heterozygous for two predicted pathogenic missense mutations, and one family was compound heterozygous for a predicted pathogenic missense mutation plus a frameshift leading to obligatory truncation of the predicted protein. The PRSS56 gene structure in public databases is based on a virtual transcript assembled from overlapping incomplete cDNA clones; we have now validated the structure of a full-length transcript from embryonic mouse brain RNA. Conclusions: PRSS56 is a good candidate for the causal gene for nanophthalmos in our families.

Heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 1, a gene involved in extracellular sugar modifications, is mutated in patients with idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						heparan sulfotransferase; Kallmann syndrome	GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; HEPARAN-SULFATE 6-O-SULFOTRANSFERASE; KALLMANN-SYNDROME; FGF RECEPTOR; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; DEFICIENCY; MUTATIONS; SPECIFICITY; EXPRESSION; FAMILY	Neuronal development is the result of a multitude of neural migrations, which require extensive cell-cell communication. These processes are modulated by extracellular matrix components, such as heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharides. HS is molecularly complex as a result of nonrandom modifications of the sugar moieties, including sulfations in specific positions. We report here mutations in HS 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS6ST1) in families with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). IHH manifests as incomplete or absent puberty and infertility as a result of defects in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuron development or function. IHH-associated HS6ST1 mutations display reduced activity in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that HS6ST1 and the complex modifications of extracellular sugars are critical for normal development in humans. Genetic experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans reveal that HS cell-specifically regulates neural branching in vivo in concert with other IHH-associated genes, including kal-1, the FGF receptor, and FGF. These findings are consistent with a model in which KAL1 can act as a modulatory coligand with FGF to activate the FGF receptor in an HS-dependent manner.

However, a Dcc homolog has not yet been identified in the chicken genome, raising the possibility that Dcc is not present in avians. Here we show that the closely related family member neogenin may functionally substitute for Dcc in the developing chicken spinal cord. The expression pattern of chicken neogenin in the developing spinal cord is a composite of the distribution patterns of both rodent Dcc and neogenin. Moreover, whereas the loss of mouse neogenin has no effect on the trajectory of commissural axons, removing chicken neogenin by RNA interference results in a phenotype similar to the functional inactivation of Dcc in mouse. Taken together, these data suggest that the chick neogenin is functionally equivalent to rodent Dcc.

Misfolded SOD1 Associated with Motor Neuron Mitochondria Alters Mitochondrial Shape and Distribution Prior to Clinical Onset	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MUTANT SOD1; AXONAL-TRANSPORT; SPINAL-CORD; MOUSE MODEL; ALS; DISEASE; HB9; DEGENERATION; RECRUITMENT	Mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are causative for inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A proportion of SOD1 mutant protein is misfolded onto the cytoplasmic face of mitochondria in one or more spinal cord cell types. By construction of mice in which mitochondrially targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein is selectively expressed in motor neurons, we demonstrate that axonal mitochondria of motor neurons are primary in vivo targets for misfolded SOD1. Mutant SOD1 alters axonal mitochondrial morphology and distribution, with dismutase active SOD1 causing mitochondrial clustering at the proximal side of Schmidt-Lanterman incisures within motor axons and dismutase inactive SOD1 producing aberrantly elongated axonal mitochondria beginning pre-symptomatically and increasing in severity as disease progresses. Somal mitochondria are altered by mutant SOD1, with loss of the characteristic cylindrical, networked morphology and its replacement by a less elongated, more spherical shape. These data indicate that mutant SOD1 binding to mitochondria disrupts normal mitochondrial distribution and size homeostasis as early pathogenic features of SOD1 mutant-mediated ALS.

However, its molecular mechanism remains undetermined. We tested the hypothesis that differential expression of synaptotagmin (Syt) isoforms explains some of the differential properties of terminal and STD DA release. Down-regulation of the dendritically expressed Syt4 and Syt7 severely reduced STD DA release, whereas terminal release required Syt1. Moreover, we found that although mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores is inefficient, Ca(2+) influx through N- and P/Q-type voltage-gated channels is critical to trigger STD DA release. Our findings provide an explanation for the differential Ca(2+) requirement of terminal and STD DA release. In addition, we propose that not all sources of intracellular Ca(2+) are equally efficient to trigger this release mechanism. Our findings have implications for a better understanding of a fundamental cell biological process mediating transcellular signaling in a system critical for diseases such as Parkinson disease.

While previous studies have focused either on the kind of information that can be encoded or on the decay of the memory trace over time, we studied capacity in terms of the length of tone sequences, i.e., the number of individual tones that can be fully encoded and maintained. By means of magnetoencephalography (MEG) we recorded MMN responses to deviant tones that could occur at any position of standard tone patterns composed of four, six or eight tones during passive, distracted listening. Whereas there was a reliable MMN response to deviant tones in the four-tone pattern in both musicians and nonmusicians, only some individuals showed MMN responses to the longer patterns. This finding of a reliable capacity of the short-term auditory store underlying the MMN response is in line with estimates of a three to five item capacity of the short-term memory trace from behavioural studies, although pitch and contour complexity covaried with sequence length, which might have led to an understatement of the reported capacity. Whereas there was a tendency for an enhancement of the pattern MMN in musicians compared to nonmusicians, a strong advantage for musicians could be shown in an accompanying behavioural task of detecting the deviants while attending to the stimuli for all pattern lengths, indicating that long-term musical training differentially affects the memory capacity of auditory short-term memory for complex tone patterns with and without attention. Also, a left-hemispheric lateralization of MMN responses in the six-tone pattern suggests that additional networks that help structuring the patterns in the temporal domain might be recruited for demanding auditory processing in the pitch domain.

Moreover, there is evidence from studies with a wide range of species that the relevant parental signals are influenced by the quality of the parental environment. The link between the quality of the environment and the nature of the parental signal is consistent with the idea that parental effects, whether direct or indirect, might serve to influence the phenotype of the offspring in a manner that is consistent with the prevailing environmental demands. In this review we explore recent studies from the field of 'environmental epigenetics' that suggest that (1) DNA methylation states are far more variable than once thought and that, at least within specific regions of the genome, there is evidence for both demethylation and remethylation in post-mitotic cells and (2) that such remodeling of DNA methylation can occur in response to environmentally-driven, intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, studies of variation in mother-offspring interactions in rodents suggest that parental signals operate during pre-and/or post-natal life to influence the DNA methylation state at specific regions of the genome leading to sustained changes in gene expression and function. We suggest that DNA methylation is a candidate mechanism for parental effects on phenotypic variation.

The performance of monotonic and new non-monotonic gradient ascent reconstruction algorithms for high-resolution neuroreceptor PET imaging	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; ORDERED SUBSETS; EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; ECAT HRRT; TRANSMISSION	Iterative expectation maximization (EM) techniques have been extensively used to solve maximum likelihood (ML) problems in positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction. Although EM methods offer a robust approach to solving ML problems, they usually suffer from slow convergence rates. The ordered subsets EM (OSEM) algorithm provides significant improvements in the convergence rate, but it can cycle between estimates converging towards the ML solution of each subset. In contrast, gradient-based methods, such as the recently proposed non-monotonic maximum likelihood (NMML) and the more established preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG), offer a globally convergent, yet equally fast, alternative to OSEM. Reported results showed that NMML provides faster convergence compared to OSEM; however, it has never been compared to other fast gradient-based methods, like PCG. Therefore, in this work we evaluate the performance of two gradient-based methods (NMML and PCG) and investigate their potential as an alternative to the fast and widely used OSEM. All algorithms were evaluated using 2D simulations, as well as a single [(11)C] DASB clinical brain dataset. Results on simulated 2D data show that both PCG and NMML achieve orders of magnitude faster convergence to the ML solution compared to MLEM and exhibit comparable performance to OSEM. Equally fast performance is observed between OSEM and PCG for clinical 3D data, but NMML seems to perform poorly. However, with the addition of a preconditioner term to the gradient direction, the convergence behaviour of NMML can be substantially improved. Although PCG is a fast convergent algorithm, the use of a (bent) line search increases the complexity of the implementation, as well as the computational time involved per iteration. Contrary to previous reports, NMML offers no clear advantage over OSEM or PCG, for noisy PET data. Therefore, we conclude that there is little evidence to replace OSEM as the algorithm of choice for many applications, especially given that in practice convergence is often not desired for algorithms seeking ML estimates.

Here, we identified neurons recruited by whisker stimulation in the rat somatosensory cortex using double immunohistochemistry for c-Fos and markers of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and investigated in vivo their contribution along with that of astrocytes in the evoked perfusion response. Whisker stimulation elicited cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases concomitantly with c-Fos upregulation in pyramidal cells that coexpressed cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and GABA interneurons that coexpressed vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and/or choline acetyltransferase, but not somatostatin or parvalbumin. The evoked CBF response was decreased by blockade of NMDA (MK-801, -37%), group I metabotropic glutamate (MPEP + LY367385, -40%), and GABA-A (picrotoxin, -31%) receptors, but not by GABA-B, VIP, or muscarinic receptor antagonism. Picrotoxin decreased stimulus-induced somatosensory evoked potentials and CBF responses. Combined blockade of GABA-A and NMDA receptors yielded an additive decreasing effect (-61%) of the evoked CBF compared with each antagonist alone, demonstrating cooperation of both excitatory and inhibitory systems in the hyperemic response. Blockade of prostanoid synthesis by inhibiting COX-2 (indomethacin, NS-398), expressed by similar to 40% of pyramidal cells but not by astrocytes, impaired the CBF response (-50%). The hyperemic response was also reduced (-40%) after inhibition of astroglial oxidative metabolism or epoxyeicosatrienoic acids synthesis. These results demonstrate that changes in pyramidal cell activity, sculpted by specific types of inhibitory GABA interneurons, drive the CBF response to whisker stimulation and, further, that metabolically active astrocytes are also required.

Neto1 Is an Auxiliary Subunit of Native Synaptic Kainate Receptors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MOSSY-FIBER SYNAPSES; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; HIGH-AFFINITY; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; GLUR6-DEFICIENT MICE; EXCITATORY SYNAPSES; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; NMDA RECEPTORS	Ionotropic glutamate receptors of AMPA, NMDA, and kainate receptor (KAR) subtypes mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate CNS. Auxiliary proteins have been identified for AMPA and NMDA receptor complexes, but little is known about KAR complex proteins. We previously identified the CUB (complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmpl) domain protein, Neto1, as an NMDA receptor-associated polypeptide. Here, we show that Neto1 is also an auxiliary subunit for endogenous synaptic KARs. We found that Neto1 and KARs coimmunoprecipitated from brain lysates, from postsynaptic densities (PSDs) and, in a manner dependent on Neto1 CUB domains, when coexpressed in heterologous cells. In Neto1-null mice, there was an similar to 50% reduction in the abundance of GluK2-KARs in hippocampal PSDs. Neto1 strongly localized to CA3 stratum lucidum, and loss of Neto1 resulted in a selective deficit in KAR-mediated neurotransmission at mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell (MF-CA3) synapses: KAR-mediated EPSCs in Neto1-null mice were reduced in amplitude and decayed more rapidly than did those in wild-type mice. In contrast, the loss of Neto2, which also localizes to stratum lucidum and interacts with KARs, had no effect on KAR synaptic abundance or MF-CA3 transmission. Indeed, MF-CA3 KAR deficits in Neto1/Neto2-double-null mutant mice were indistinguishable from Neto1 single-null mice. Thus, our findings establish Neto1 as an auxiliary protein required for synaptic function of KARs. The ability of Neto1 to regulate both NMDARs and KARs reveals a unique dual role in controlling synaptic transmission by serving as an auxiliary protein for these two classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors in a synapse-specific fashion.

Because of their high lipophilicity and persistence, PBDEs bioaccumulate in all abiotic and biological matrices. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term neurobehavioral and physiological effects of exposure to environmental doses of PBDE-99 in adult rats. Rats received a daily administration of PBDE-99 for 90 days by oral gavage at 0.15, 1.5 and 15 mu g/kg, doses which are relevant of human exposure. Before and after the 90 days of exposure, behavioral tests including the open-field and the elevated plus-maze tests for locomotor activity and anxiety, and the Morris water maze for spatial learning were conducted. Physiological measures such as body weight, food and water consumption, organs weight, hepatic enzymes levels and PBDE-99 concentration in adipose tissue were also evaluated at the end of exposure. There was no effect on body weight, food and water consumption, organs weight, hepatic enzymes levels despite rising PBDE-99 concentration in adipose tissue with the doses tested. Moreover, there was no effect on locomotor activity and exploration, and spatial learning. Deleterious effects of PBDE-99 at high doses have often been highlighted in many studies after an acute dose whereas exposure during 90 days at realistic doses would have no significant effect in adult rats.

NTDs arise as consequence of the failure of fusion of the neural tube early during embryogenesis. NTDs' pathogenesis has teen linked to genes involved in folate metabolism, consistent with an epidemiologic evidence that 70% of NTDs can be prevented by maternal periconceptional supplementation. However, polymorphisms in such genes are not linked in all populations, suggesting that other genetic factors and environmental factors could be involved. Animal models have provided crucial mechanistic information and possible candidate genes to explain susceptibility to NTDs. A crucial role has been assigned to the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, a highly conserved, non-canonical Wnt-frizzled-dishevelled signaling cascade that plays a key role in establishing and maintaining polarity in the plane of the epithelium and in the process of convergent extension during gastrulation and neurulation in vertebrates. The Loop-tail (Lp) mouse that develops craniorachischisis carry missense mutations in the PCP core gene Vangl2, that is the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila Strabismus/Van gogh (Stbm/Vang). The presence of mutations in human VANGL1 and VANGL2 genes encourages us to extend the investigation to other PCP genes that, with VANGL, play an essential role in neurulation during development.

Methods: We performed a review of the English-language literature on the PubMed database using the terms hypothyroidism, muscle disease, hypothyroid myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, compression neuropathy, and acute compartment syndrome. Results: Myopathy occurs frequently among patients with overt hypothyroidism; however, severe myoneural injury seems to be precipitated or accompanied by comorbid conditions. Focal peroneal neuropathy may be related to hypothyroidism-induced extrinsic compression from severe myopathy and soft tissue swelling in a narrowed fascial compartment. Conclusion: Severe short-term iatrogenic hypothyroidism may lead to severe myopathy and compression nerve injury in patients with underlying diabetic neuropathy. We recommend avoidance of withdrawal of thyroid hormone for purposes of remnant ablation among patients with preexisting diabetic neuropathy.

ADAPT Res Grp	Extended results of the Alzheimer's disease anti-inflammatory prevention trial	ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Randomized controlled trial; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Follow-up; Biomarkers; Hypothesis	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MINI-MENTAL STATE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; DRUGS; CELECOXIB; NAPROXEN; NSAIDS; RISK; CYCLOOXYGENASE	Background: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) delay onset of Alzheimer's dementia (AD), but randomized trials show no benefit from NSAIDs in patients with symptomatic AD. The Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT) randomized 2528 elderly persons to naproxen or celecoxib versus placebo for 2 years (standard deviation = 11 months) before treatments were terminated. During the treatment interval, 32 cases of AD revealed increased rates in both NSAID-assigned groups. Methods: We continued the double-masked ADAPT protocol for 2 additional years to investigate incidence of AD (primary outcome). We then collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 117 volunteer participants to assess their ratio of CSF tau to A beta(1-42). Results: Including 40 new events observed during follow-up of 2071 randomized individuals (92% of participants at treatment cessation), there were 72 AD cases. Overall, NSAID-related harm was no longer evident, but secondary analyses showed that increased risk remained notable in the first 2.5 years of observations, especially in 54 persons enrolled with cognitive impairment-no dementia (CIND). These same analyses showed later reduction in AD incidence among asymptomatic enrollees who were given naproxen. CSF biomarker assays suggested that the latter result reflected reduced Alzheimer-type neurodegeneration. Conclusions: These data suggest a revision of the original ADAPT hypothesis that NSAIDs reduce AD risk, as follows: NSAIDs have an adverse effect in later stages of AD pathogenesis, whereas asymptomatic individuals treated with conventional NSAIDs such as naproxen experience reduced AD incidence, but only after 2 to 3 years. Thus, treatment effects differ at various stages of disease. This hypothesis is consistent with data from both trials and epidemiological studies. (C) 2011 The Alzheimer's Association.

Here, we investigate these questions by presenting 36 wild-caught adult male Carib grackles (Quiscalus lugubris) with a novel problem-solving task. Twenty birds solved the task ("innovators") while 16 did not ("non-innovators"). We compared innovators to non-innovators and explored variation in latency to innovate to determine the characteristics of an innovative bird. Innovativeness was not predicted by any morphological trait, but innovators had higher exploration scores and lower object neophobia scores than non-innovators. Within the innovators, latency to innovate was positively correlated with learning speed. Video analysis also revealed a marked difference in the way individuals interacted with the novel apparatus: when innovators contacted the correct part of the apparatus, they continued to do so until they solved the problem. Non-innovators often contacted the correct part of the apparatus, but did not persist in doing so. The importance of obstacle movement cues was confirmed by an experiment where they were manipulated.

Over the past few years the authors have been investigating sex differences in brain function in individuals with schizophrenia and have found an intriguing disturbance of normal sexual dimorphism during emotional and cognitive processing. These results can be partly accounted for by altered levels of sex steroid hormones (i.e., estrogen and testosterone) in patients. A handful of clinical research groups have tried low doses of estrogen, testosterone or their precursors as adjunct therapies to the currently available antipsychotic medications in women and men with schizophrenia. The results have been promising, but further investigation is warranted. In the future, new more specific steroidal compounds will be developed and we will see more studies examining sex differences in the brain, behavior and mental health problems. This research will help to identify individuals who may benefit greatest from adjunct hormonal therapies and will further our understanding of the etiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.

Research ethics boards (REBs) bear responsibility for the oversight of these challenges but neuroimagers struggle with the practical aspects of ethics review and report that administrative load and inconsistency contribute to eroding confidence and trust in ethics review. Our goal was to discuss and propose strategies for institutional and educational change to improve ethics review. We used an iterative and deliberative workshop-based writing process involving multiple disciplines. We propose recommendations in three tension areas: (1) communication between researchers and REBs; (2) collaboration and sharing of expertise between REBs; and (3) practical considerations and the needs of neuroimagers engaged in the ethics review process. Our recommendations are intended as openings rather than endpoints. Researchers and research ethics governance communities should decide on the future uptake of these recommendations.

Although several medications may temporarily augment cognitive abilities in AD, there presently exists no proven method to avoid the inevitable clinical deterioration in this devastating condition. The delineation of risk factors for the development of AD offers hope for the advent of effective prevention or interventions that might retard the onset of symptoms. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of midlife risk factors implicated in the etiopathogenesis of sporadic AD. Although some risk factors are heritable and largely beyond our control, others are determined by lifestyle or environment and are potentially modifiable. In a companion paper, we introduce the concept of an Alzheimer Risk Assessment Clinic for ascertainment and mitigation of these and other putative dementia risk factors in middle-aged adults.

A review of heritable and 'acquired' dementia risk factors, many operating at midlife, is presented in a companion paper. Objectives: In 2009, an Alzheimer Risk Assessment Clinic (ARAC) was established at the Jewish General Hospital (Montreal) to address the concerns increasingly being voiced by active middle-aged individuals at risk for AD. A positive family history of AD and/or perceived changes in personal cognitive function (predominantly short-term memory) are main reasons for referral. The primary objectives of ARAC are to (i) ascertain, inform and mitigate the risks of developing AD in cognitively-healthy persons aged 40-65 based on best available medical and epidemiological evidence, (ii) conduct scientific research on midlife dementia risk and prevention in this population and (iii) provide instruction in dementia risk assessment and management to health professionals, clinical/research fellows, medical residents and students. ARAC infrastructure, evaluation protocol, risk profile classification scheme, interventions, knowledge dissemination program, case vignettes, and seminal research projects are described. Conclusions: It is hoped that ARAC and similar initiatives will help prevent or delay dementia by innovating effective interventions based on increasingly nuanced estimation of modifiable AD risk in presymptomatic persons.

Aggressive medical management might not be sufficient to alleviate the increasing intracranial pressure (ICP), and decompressive craniectomy (DC) can be considered. Decompressive craniectomy can be divided into categories, according to the timing and rationale for performing the procedure: primary (done at the time of mass lesion evacuation) and secondary craniectomy (done to treat refractory ICP). Most studies analyze primary and secondary DC together. Our hypothesis is that these two groups are distinct and the aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the differences in order to better predict outcome after DC. Methods: Seventy patients had DC over a period of four years at our center. They were divided into two groups based on the timing of the DC. Primary DC (44 patients) was done within 24 hours of the injury for mass lesion evacuation. Secondary DC (26 patients) was done after 24 hours and purely for the treatment of refractory ICP. Pre-op characteristics and post-op outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results: There was a significant difference in the mechanism of injury, the pupil abnormalities and Marshall grade between primary and secondary DC. There was also a significant difference in outcome with primary DC showing 45.5% good outcome and 40.9% mortality and secondary DC showing 73.1% good outcome and 15.4% mortality. Conclusions: Primary and secondary DC have different indications and patients characteristics. Outcome prediction following DC should be adjusted according to the surgical indication.

Correlations between sadness-induced cerebral activations and schizophrenia symptoms: An fMRI study of sex differences	EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; fMRI; Sex differences; Emotion processing; Positive and negative symptoms	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; NEURAL RESPONSE; EMOTION RECOGNITION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; INTENSITY; PSYCHOSIS; PATTERN	Background: The functional neuroimaging studies of emotion processing in schizophrenia have revealed variable results attributed partly to differential symptomatology and sex of tested patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between cerebral activations during exposure to emotional material and schizophrenia symptoms in men versus women. Method: Fifteen men and 10 women with schizophrenia, equivalent in terms of age, medication and experienced symptomatology, underwent functional MRI during viewing sad and neutral film excerpts. Data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping Software (SPM2). Results: Across all the patients there was a significant inverse relationship between negative symptoms and activations in the right prefrontal cortex during processing of sad versus neutral stimuli. In men, activations during sad versus neutral stimuli in the prefrontal, temporal and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the caudate and cerebellum, were positively correlated with negative symptoms. In women, there were inverse correlations between positive symptoms and activations in the hippocampus, parietal and occipital cortex during the same condition. Conclusion: Present results confirmed association of prefrontal hypofunction with negative symptoms in schizophrenia. More interestingly, the results revealed a diametrically different pattern of symptom-correlated brain activity in men and women with schizophrenia, suggesting that the processing of sadness is mediated via neurophysiological mechanism related to negative symptoms in men and the mechanism related to positive symptoms in women.

Restless Legs Syndrome-Associated MEIS1 Risk Variant Influences Iron Homeostasis	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; BRAIN IRON; FERRITIN; TRANSFERRIN; EXPRESSION; GENES	Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent sleep disorder that is linked to disturbed iron homeostasis. Genetic studies identified MEIS1 as an RLS-predisposing gene, where the RLS risk haplotype is associated with decreased MEIS1 mRNA and protein expression. We show here that RNA interference treatment of the MEIS1 worm orthologue increases ferritin expression in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the RLS-associated haplotype leads to increased expression of ferritin and DMT1 in RLS brain tissues. Additionally, human cells cultured under iron-deficient conditions show reduced MEIS1 expression. Our data establish a link between the RLS MEIS1 gene and iron metabolism.

Uri			During Glaucoma, alpha 2-Macroglobulin Accumulates in Aqueous Humor and Binds to Nerve Growth Factor, Neutralizing Neuroprotection	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							GANGLION-CELL DEATH; OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA; NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; TNF-ALPHA; NEUROTROPHIC RATIONALE; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; OCULAR HYPERTENSION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TRKA; MECHANISM	PURPOSE. Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy caused by the chronic and progressive death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), resulting in irreversible blindness. Ocular hypertension is a major risk factor, but RGC death often continues after ocular hypertension is normalized, and can take place with normal tension. Continuous RGC death was related in rodents and humans to the local upregulation of neurotoxic proteins, such as TNF-alpha. In rat models of glaucoma, ocular hypertension also upregulates the expression of alpha 2-macroglobulin, which is neurotoxic. alpha 2-macroglobulin upregulation in the retina is long-lived, even after high IOP is reduced with medication. alpha 2-macroglobulin is examined as a possible biomarker in human glaucoma, and a possible neurotoxic mechanism of action is sought. METHODS. Quantitative Western blotting of alpha 2-macroglobulin in samples obtained from aqueous humor (human and rat) and retina (rat) was conducted. Ex vivo neuronal survival assays and nerve growth factor-alpha 2-macroglobulin binding studies using surface plasmon resonance were used. RESULTS. Increased soluble alpha 2-macroglobulin protein is also present in the aqueous humor in a rat glaucoma model, as well as in the aqueous humor of human glaucoma patients but not in cataract patients. One mechanism by which alpha 2-macroglobulin is neurotoxic is by inhibiting the neuroprotective activity of nerve growth factor via TrkA receptors. CONCLUSIONS. This work further documents a potential novel mechanism of RGC death and a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for glaucoma.

Does the Incidence of Traumatic Brain Injury in Children Increase After Craniofrontal Surgery?	JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Congress of the International-Society-of-Craniofacial-Surgery	OCT, 2009	Oxford, ENGLAND	Int Soc Craniofacial Surg		Traumatic brain injury (TBI); bony defects; craniofrontal surgery	CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY; COMPLICATIONS	Background: Craniofrontal reshaping (CR) for the treatment of craniosynostosis results in a temporary cranial defect due to the advancement and/or expansion of the supraorbital and frontal bones. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the incidence traumatic brain injury (TBI) was increased in patients after CR as a result of this breach in skull integrity. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with a diagnosis of craniosynostosis who underwent CR between 1997 and 2007 at our institution. The incidence of TBI (defined as a computed tomography-documented brain or skull injury or loss of consciousness) was determined during a 2-year postoperative follow-up period. Patients older than 1 year at the time of surgery, or those with less than 2 years of follow-up after surgery, were excluded. Results: A total of 396 patients met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of TBI was zero (95% confidence interval, 0-760/100,000). Conclusions: The estimated incidence of TBI after CR surgery is between 0 and 760 per 100,000 patients in our clinic population. These data indicate that although CR may be associated with a slightly increased risk of TBI while the skull is healing, the absolute incidence of such injury remains extremely rare.

To examine the association of engagement in cognitively stimulating activities with cognitive and functional decline in a population-based sample of incident Alzheimer's disease (AD). Method. After diagnosis, 187 participants (65% females) were followed semiannually for a mean 2.7 (SD = 0.4) years. Mean age and education were 84.6 (SD = 5.8) and 13.2 (SD = 2.9) years. Caregivers enumerated cognitively stimulating leisure activities via the Lifestyle Activities Questionnaire. Cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination and functional ability via the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes. Linear mixed models tested the association between stimulating activities and change over time in each outcome. Covariates were demographic factors, estimated premorbid IQ, presence/absence of the APOE epsilon 4 allele, duration of dementia, level of physical activity, and general health. Results. At initial assessment, 87% of participants were engaged in one or more stimulating activities, with mean (SD) activities = 4.0 (3.0). This number declined to 2.4 (2.0) at the final visit. There was a statistical interaction between dementia duration and number of activities in predicting rate of cognitive decline (p = .02) and overall functional ability (p = .006). Discussion. Active involvement in cognitively stimulating pursuits may be beneficial for persons with AD.

In vivo Conditions Induce Faithful Encoding of Stimuli by Reducing Nonlinear Synchronization in Vestibular Sensory Neurons	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							INTRINSIC MEMBRANE-PROPERTIES; PHASE-LOCKED RESPONSES; PERIPHERAL INNERVATION PATTERNS; SPIKE-FREQUENCY ADAPTATION; AUDITORY-NERVE FIBERS; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; NUCLEUS NEURONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; GUINEA-PIG	Previous studies have shown that neurons within the vestibular nuclei (VN) can faithfully encode the time course of sensory input through changes in firing rate in vivo. However, studies performed in vitro have shown that these same VN neurons often display nonlinear synchronization (i.e. phase locking) in their spiking activity to the local maxima of sensory input, thereby severely limiting their capacity for faithful encoding of said input through changes in firing rate. We investigated this apparent discrepancy by studying the effects of in vivo conditions on VN neuron activity in vitro using a simple, physiologically based, model of cellular dynamics. We found that membrane potential oscillations were evoked both in response to step and zap current injection for a wide range of channel conductance values. These oscillations gave rise to a resonance in the spiking activity that causes synchronization to sinusoidal current injection at frequencies below 25 Hz. We hypothesized that the apparent discrepancy between VN response dynamics measured in in vitro conditions (i.e., consistent with our modeling results) and the dynamics measured in vivo conditions could be explained by an increase in trial-to-trial variability under in vivo vs. in vitro conditions. Accordingly, we mimicked more physiologically realistic conditions in our model by introducing a noise current to match the levels of resting discharge variability seen in vivo as quantified by the coefficient of variation (CV). While low noise intensities corresponding to CV values in the range 0.04-0.24 only eliminated synchronization for low (< 8 Hz) frequency stimulation but not high (> 12 Hz) frequency stimulation, higher noise intensities corresponding to CV values in the range 0.5-0.7 almost completely eliminated synchronization for all frequencies. Our results thus predict that, under natural (i.e. in vivo) conditions, the vestibular system uses increased variability to promote fidelity of encoding by single neurons. This prediction can be tested experimentally in vitro.

Using intracerebral hemorrhage on a per-trajectory basis as our primary end point, we quantified the level of surgical risk associated with agent delivery to deep nuclei. Secondarily, we quantified other event rates and examined relationships between intracerebral hemorrhage and 8 variables related to patient and practice characteristics. Meta-analytic techniques were used to pool complication rates reported in published articles involving deep brain stimulator electrode implantation or infusion of vectors, tissues, or trophic factors. One hundred nine studies were included in our analysis, comprising 6237 patients and 9890 trajectories to deep nuclei. The estimated per-trajectory intracerebral hemorrhage rate was 1.57%(95% confidence interval, 1.26%-1.95%). The proportion of trajectories leading to permanent or serious neurological deficits was 0.41%(0.28%-0.60%). The estimated mortality rate per trajectory was 0.14% (0.07%-0.29%). No relationship between intracerebral hemorrhage and sex, age, duration of disease, or exclusion of patients with surgical complications was observed; a significant positive relationship was observed with the use of microelectrode recording and a significant negative relationship with putamenal delivery. Our results show a significant difference in intracerebral hemorrhage rates between inoculations and electrode implantation. Our findings suggest that studies involving multiple trajectories to deep nuclei involve a high level of risk. However, inoculations may be significantly safer than electrode implantation. Our analysis has implications for the ethics of preclinical research, independent review of risk, subject selection, and adverse event reporting.

The Rho family of small GTPases, in particular Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are important regulators of the cytoskeleton in neuronal cells acting, downstream of most, if not all, guidance cue receptors. Furthermore, recent studies using in vivo knockout mouse models provide new evidence of the primary role played by Rho GTPase signaling during the development of the nervous system. Here, we review our recent understanding of Rho GTPase signaling in response to classical axon guidance cues in mammalian cells. We also describe how in vivo knockout mouse models have been useful to implicate Rho GTPase signaling during the formation of the nervous system. Finally, we present several lines of evidence showing the involvement of Rho GTPase signaling in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

Genetic factors play an important role in both the onset and severity of the condition, with mutations in several ion-channel genes being implicated, including those encoding the GABA(A) receptor. Here, we evaluated the frequency of additional mutations in the GABA(A) receptor by direct sequencing of the complete open reading frame of the GABRA1 and GABRG2 genes from a cohort of French Canadian families with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Using this approach, we have identified three novel mutations that were absent in over 400 control chromosomes. In GABRA1, two mutations were found, with the first being a 25-bp insertion that was associated with intron retention (i.e. K353delins18X) and the second corresponding to a single point mutation that replaced the aspartate 219 residue with an asparagine (i.e. D219N). Electrophysiological analysis revealed that K353delins18X and D219N altered GABA(A) receptor function by reducing the total surface expression of mature protein and/or by curtailing neurotransmitter effectiveness. Both defects would be expected to have a detrimental effect on inhibitory control of neuronal circuits. In contrast, the single point mutation identified in the GABRG2 gene, namely P83S, was indistinguishable from the wildtype subunit in terms of surface expression and functionality. This finding was all the more intriguing as the mutation exhibited a high degree of penetrance in three generations of one French Canadian family. Further experimentation will be required to understand how this mutation contributes to the occurrence of IGE in these individuals.

Negative emotionality, depressive symptoms and cortisol diurnal rhythms: Analysis of a community sample of middle-aged males	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Cortisol; Negative emotionality; Depressive symptomatology	SALIVARY CORTISOL; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; STRESS-RESPONSE; NEUROTICISM; ASSOCIATIONS; ADULTHOOD; HEALTH; WOMEN; TWIN	Prior research suggests that individuals with particular personality traits, like negative emotionality, are at greater risk for adverse health outcomes. Despite bivariate associations between negative emotionality, depressive symptoms and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA axis), few studies have sought to understand the biological pathways through which negative emotionality, depressive symptomatology and cortisol one of the primary hormonal products of the HPA axis are associated. The present study explored whether negative emotionality influenced cortisol dysregulation through current depressive symptomatology and whether negative emotionality served as a moderator of the relationship between depressive symptoms and cortisol. In the community-based Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging, 783 male twins completed two days of cortisol saliva sampling in their natural environments. Three measures of cortisol were analyzed: waking levels, the cortisol awakening response, and the peak to bed slope. Depressive symptoms significantly mediated the associations between negative emotionality and the peak to bed slope. A 2-way interaction between depressive symptoms and negative emotionality was significant for the peak to bed slope and for waking levels of cortisol. Exploration of the interactions illustrated that depressive symptoms only affected cortisol slopes at average or high levels of negative emotionality and only affected waking levels at low levels of negative emotionality. Negative emotionality and depressive symptoms were not related to the cortisol awakening response. This is the first study to find indirect associations between negative emotionality and peak to bed cortisol slopes through depressive symptoms. These findings illustrate the complex interplay between personality characteristics, depressive symptoms and different indices of the cortisol diurnal rhythm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This review focuses on the unique properties of two classes of nanoparticles: gold nanoparticles (GNP) and quantum dots, and how these properties are benefiting cellular and in vivo imaging. We discuss the surface plasmon resonance of GNP and its implications for various imaging techniques of biological relevance. Furthermore, the key properties of quantum dots are reviewed, and their use alone or in combination with traditional fluorescent dyes for biological imaging are described. The underlying principles of these techniques are provided, along with some representative examples. Microsc. Res. Tech. 74: 592-604, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Eight pharmacoresistant patients, not candidates for ablative surgery, received chronic AH-DBS (130 Hz, follow-up 12-24 months): two patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and six patients with non-lesional mesial TLE (NLES). The effects of stepwise increases in intensity (0-Off to 2 V) and stimulation configuration (quadripolar and bipolar), on seizure frequency and neuropsychological performance were studied. The two HS patients obtained a significant decrease (65-75%) in seizure frequency with high voltage bipolar DBS (>= 1 V) or with quadripolar stimulation. Two out of six NLES patients became seizure-free, one of them without stimulation, suggesting a microlesional effect. Two NLES patients experienced reductions of seizure frequency (65-70%), whereas the remaining two showed no significant seizure reduction. Neuropsychological evaluations showed reversible memory impairments in two patients under strong stimulation only. AH-DBS showed long-term efficiency in most of the TLE patients. It is a valuable treatment option for patients who suffer from drug resistant epilepsy and who are not candidates for resective surgery. The effects of changes in the stimulation parameters suggest that a large zone of stimulation would be required in HS patients, while a limited zone of stimulation or even a microlesional effect could be sufficient in NLES patients, for whom the importance of the proximity of the electrode to the epileptogenic zone remains to be studied. Further studies are required to ascertain these latter observations. (C) 2011 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the long-term sequelae of inflammatory demyelination on neurons and axons. Spinal cord tissue of 31 MS patients was compared to three amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 10 control subjects. MS lesions were staged according to the density of KiM-1P positive macrophages and microglia and the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP) positive phagocytes. T cells were quantified in the parenchyma and meninges. Neuroaxonal changes were studied by immunoreactivity (IR) for amyloid precursor protein (APP) and variably phosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI312, SMI31, SMI32). Little T cell infiltration was still evident in chronic inactive lesions. The loss of SMI32 IR in ventral horn neurons correlated with MS lesion development and disease progression. Similarly, axonal loss in white matter (WM) lesions correlated with disease duration. A selective reduction of axonal phosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI31) was observed in WM lesions. In ALS, the loss of neuronal SMI32 IR was even more pronounced, whereas the relative axonal reduction resembled that found in MS. Progressive neuroaxonal neurofilament alterations in the context of chronic inflammatory demyelination may reflect changes in neuroaxonal metabolism and result in chronic neuroaxonal dysfunction as a putative substrate of clinical progression.

The MRI signature of newly diagnosed epilepsy is not yet fully defined, mainly because of the lack of a cohesive methodology to evaluate structural changes in the early stages of the disease. By revealing subtle lesions that previously eluded visual inspection in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, quantitative computer-assisted image analysis has clearly demonstrated increased sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional techniques. Therefore, the application of image processing methods in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy promises to reduce the trial-error period in potential surgical candidates, provide solid biomarkers for monitoring the disease and identifying treatment responders. A clearer understanding of brain pathology at the early stages of the disorder will help clinicians to develop better criteria for identifying patients who are at risk of secondary brain damage and for timely intervention that achieves seizure control.

The neuronal discharges taking place during an interictal spike or spike-wave burst result in an increase in metabolism and blood flow, which is reflected in the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal measured by fMRI. This increase is most intense in the region generating the discharge but is also present in regions affected by the discharge. On occasion, epileptic discharges result in decreased metabolism, the origin of which is only partially understood. EEG-fMRI applied to focal epilepsy results in maxima of the BOLD signal most often concordant with other methods of localization and has been shown to help in localizing epileptic foci in nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsy. It has also demonstrated the involvement of the thalamus in generalized epileptic discharges. In patients with new-onset epilepsy it could be used to evaluate the source and extent of the brain structures involved during discharges and their evolution as the disease progresses.

Indirect pathway between the primary auditory and visual cortices through layer V pyramidal neurons in V2L in mouse and the effects of bilateral enucleation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						blindness; cortico-cortical; heteromodal; morphology; plasticity	BLIND MOLE-RAT; CROSS-MODAL NEUROPLASTICITY; LASER-SCANNING MICROSCOPE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; STRIATE CORTEX; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS	Visual cortical areas are activated by auditory stimuli in blind mice. Direct heteromodal cortical connections have been shown between the primary auditory cortex (A1) and primary visual cortex (V1), and between A1 and secondary visual cortex (V2). Auditory afferents to V2 terminate in close proximity to neurons that project to V1, and potentially constitute an effective indirect pathway between A1 and V1. In this study, we injected a retrograde adenoviral vector that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein under a synapsin promotor in V1 and biotinylated dextran amine as an anterograde tracer in A1 to determine: (i) whether A1 axon terminals establish synaptic contacts onto the lateral part of V2 (V2L) neurons that project to V1; and (ii) if this indirect cortical pathway is altered by a neonatal enucleation in mice. Complete dendritic arbors of layer V pyramidal neurons were reconstructed in 3D, and putative contacts between pre-synaptic auditory inputs and postsynaptic visual neurons were analysed using a laserscanning confocal microscope. Putative synaptic contacts were classified as high-confidence and low-confidence contacts, and charted onto dendritic trees. As all reconstructed layer V pyramidal neurons received auditory inputs by these criteria, we conclude that V2L acts as an important relay between A1 and V1. Auditory inputs are preferentially located onto lower branch order dendrites in enucleated mice. Also, V2L neurons are subject to morphological reorganizations in both apical and basal dendrites after the loss of vision. The A1-V2L-V1 pathway could be involved in multisensory processing and contribute to the auditory activation of the occipital cortex in the blind rodent.	[Laramee, M.

However, the functional alterations occurring within an epileptic PC network are unknown. Here, we analyzed this issue by using in vitro electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry in brain tissue obtained from pilocarpine-treated epileptic rats and age-matched, nonepileptic controls (NECs). Neurons recorded intracellularly from the PC deep layers in the two experimental groups had similar intrinsic and firing properties and generated spontaneous depolarizing and hyperpolarizing postsynaptic potentials with comparable duration and amplitude. However, spontaneous and stimulus-induced epileptiform discharges were seen with field potential recordings in over one-fifth of pilocarpine-treated slices but never in NEC tissue. These network events were reduced in duration by antagonizing NMDA receptors and abolished by NMDA 1 non-NMDA glutamatergic receptor antagonists. Pharmacologically isolated isolated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials had reversal potentials for the early GABAA receptor-mediated component that were significantly more depolarized in pilocarpine-treated cells. Experiments with a potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 antibody identified, in pilocarpine-treated PC, a significant immunostaining decrease that could not be explained by neuronal loss. However, interneurons expressing parvalbumin and neuropeptide Y were found to be decreased throughout the PC, whereas cholecystokinin-positive cells were diminished in superficial layers.

Initially, drugs like l-dopa or dopaminergic agonists are able to control these symptoms, but with the progress of the disease these drugs become less effective. Previous studies have reported that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can improve these motor symptoms. The objective of this study was to investigate the neural mechanisms through which 25 Hz rTMS may improve motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effects of 25 Hz. rTMS in 10 Parkinson's disease patients. Fifteen rTMS sessions were performed over the primary cortex on both hemispheres (one after the other) during a 12-week period. The patients were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of a simple tapping and a complex tapping task, 1 week before the administration of the first rTMS session and just after the last session. rTMS improved bradykinesia, while functional magnetic resonance imaging showed different cortical patterns in prefrontal cortex when patients performed the complex tapping test. Furthermore, the improvement in bradykinesia is associated with caudate nucleus activity increases in simple tapping. Finally, we observed a relative change in functional connectivity between the prefrontal areas and the supplementary motor area after rTMS. These results show a potential beneficial effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease which is substantiated by neural changes observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging.

The effect of DZ on the behavioural and neural correlates of rule-guided response selection has not been directly investigated. We studied DZ effects, compared to placebo (PL), on performance and brain responses, using fMRI, during rule implementation, when arbitrary stimulus-specific rules were involved. BOLD activity was measured in eighteen healthy volunteers during rule-guided response selection with DZ or PL administered in two counterbalanced sessions. A 10 mg dose of DZ was sufficient to increase reaction times and to reduce accuracy in a rule-guided task but not in a motor task containing the same stimuli. With PL, implementing arbitrary rules activated right anterior cingulate/middle frontal gyri. Under DZ more brain areas were recruited during the task compared to PL, especially occipito-parietal cortices, as well as the left temporal lobe. For the congruent trials rules, more activity was observed in the right retrosplenial cortex when participants had taken DZ. These findings indicate that DZ might disrupt the neural activity necessary to implement novel rules, supporting the notion that DZ influence on behaviour goes beyond perceptual and motor processes that can potentially compromise complex cognitive functions.

Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity patterns in 20 right-handed nonmusicians as they listened to natural and temporally reordered musical and speech stimuli matched for familiarity, emotion, and valence. Heart rate variability and mean respiration rates were simultaneously measured and were found not to differ between musical and speech stimuli. Although the same manipulation of temporal structure elicited brain activation level differences of similar magnitude for both music and speech stimuli, multivariate classification analysis revealed distinct spatial patterns of brain responses in the 2 domains. Distributed neuronal populations that included the inferior frontal cortex, the posterior and anterior superior and middle temporal gyri, and the auditory brainstem classified temporal structure manipulations in music and speech with significant levels of accuracy. While agreeing with previous findings that music and speech processing share neural substrates, this work shows that temporal structure in the 2 domains is encoded differently, highlighting a fundamental dissimilarity in how the same neural resources are deployed.

However, the specificity of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the emotional and attentional modulation of pain still remains unclear. In order to differentiate the supra-spinal and spinal mechanisms involved in emotional and attentional modulation of pain, we measured pain perception (self-ratings) and the RIII reflex in healthy volunteers during the presentation of pleasant, unpleasant and neutral pictures, as well as during a baseline condition with no visual distractor (Experiment 1). In a second experiment, we manipulated the emotional arousal induced by pleasant and unpleasant pictures in order to compare more directly the effects of distraction and arousal. Whereas emotional valence influenced pain and the amplitude of the RIII reflex in the same direction (negative > positive), distraction by neutral pictures reduced pain but increased the RIII reflex relative to baseline. Increased arousal further potentiated the effects of negative valence on both pain and the RIII reflex and the effects of positive emotions on pain, as previously reported. However, arousal did not potentiate the inhibitory effect of positive pictures on the RIII and seems insufficient to account for the effect of distraction on the RIII. Overall, these data provide further evidence that attention and emotion modulate pain through partially dissociable neurophysiological mechanisms.

Hypoxia drives plastic divergence in cichlid body shape	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Constraints; Divergent selection; Environmental stressors; Geometric morphometrics; Gills; Local adaptation; Oxygen; Path analysis; Phenotypic plasticity; Trade-offs	PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; SWIMMING PERFORMANCE; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; AFRICAN CYPRINID; BARBUS-NEUMAYERI; CRUCIAN CARP; TRADE-OFF; FISH; MORPHOLOGY; VERTEBRATES	Organisms experience multiple selective agents that can influence phenotypes through heritable and/or plastic changes, often reflecting complex interactions between phenotype and environment. Environmental factors can directly influence phenotypes, but also indirectly affect phenotypic variation when genetic/plastic change in one trait results in correlated genetic/plastic change in another trait. In fishes, body shape is a trait that might be particularly prone to influence from environmental pressures that act on other morphological features. Variation in dissolved oxygen among aquatic environments has a large impact on the size of the gills and brains of fishes. It is likely that dissolved oxygen interacts with other environmental factors to both directly and indirectly influence patterns of body shape variation. We examined effects of dissolved oxygen on body shape variation among populations of an African cichlid fish (Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor) from multiple high- and low-oxygen sites within a single drainage in Uganda. A split-brood laboratory experiment was used to estimate plasticity of gill and brain size, and we used morphometric analyses to identify variation in body shape in F-1 offspring. Several analyses enabled us to identify genetic effects among populations, and effects of oxygen acting either directly on body shape or indirectly through its effects on gill and brain size. A large part of the variation in body shape was due to plastic variation in gill size associated with dissolved oxygen. Fish raised under low oxygen had deeper heads and shorter bodies, and this variation was driven by both direct effects of oxygen and indirect effects of gill size variation. Body shape variation in fishes should reflect interacting effects of multiple environmental factors that act directly or indirectly on morphology. Body shape might be particularly difficult to predict when phenotypes are plastic, because changes among populations would occur rapidly and be unrelated to genetic variation.

DBS is seen as a more reversible intervention than ablative neurosurgery but it is nonetheless a treatment that carries significant risks. A review of preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of DBS to treat addiction suggests that more animal research is required to establish the safety and efficacy of the technology and to identify optimal treatment parameters before investigating its use in addicted persons. Severely addicted persons who try and fail to achieve abstinence may, however, be desperate enough to undergo such an invasive treatment if they believe that it will cure their addiction. History shows that the desperation for a "cure" of addiction can lead to the use of risky medical procedures before they have been rigorously tested. In the event that DBS is used in the treatment of addiction, we provide minimum ethical requirements for clinical trials of its use in the treatment of addiction. These include: restrictions of trials to severely intractable cases of addiction; independent oversight to ensure that patients have the capacity to consent and give that consent on the basis of a realistic appreciation of the potential benefits and risks of DBS; and rigorous assessments of the effectiveness and safety of this treatment compared to the best available treatments for addiction.
