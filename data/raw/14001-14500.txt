Mechanisms of brain edema in acute liver failure and impact of novel therapeutic interventions	NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						acute liver failure; ammonia; brain edema; hypothermia; intracranial pressure	FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; UNCONTROLLED INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; HIGH-VOLUME PLASMAPHERESIS; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; PORTACAVAL ANASTOMOSIS; MILD HYPOTHERMIA; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; CULTURED ASTROCYTES; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE	Continued elucidation of the mechanisms of brain edema in acute liver failure (ALF) has established ammonia and the astrocyte as major players in its pathogenesis. The metabolism of ammonia to glutamine appears to be a requisite, and is followed by an osmotic disturbance in the brain, mitochondrial dysfunction with oxidative/nitrosative stress, and alterations of brain glucose metabolism. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is also altered in ALF and strongly influence the development of brain edema and intracranial hypertension. Additional factors such as systemic inflammation, alterations of the brain extracellular concentration of amino acids and neurotransmitters, and others have been identified and may contribute to the cerebral alterations of ALF. Such pathophysiologic insights are reflected in the various clinical trials of novel therapeutic interventions using ammonia-lowering agents, N-acetylcysteine, hypertonic saline, indomethacin, high-volume plasmapheresis, bio-artificial liver assist devices, albumin dialysis and mild hypothermia.

Acupuncture analgesia is a very useful clinical tool for pain relief, which has over 2500-year history in China. The present study investigated the role of oxytocin in acupuncture analgesia in the rat through oxytocin administration and measurement. Central administration of oxytocin (intraventricular injection or intrathecal injection) enhanced acupuncture analgesia, while central administration of anti-oxytocin serum weakened acupuncture analgesia in a dose-dependent manner. However, intravenous injection of oxytocin or anti-oxytocin serum did not influence acupuncture analgesia. Electrical acupuncture of "Zusanli" (St. 36) reduced oxytocin concentration in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, and elevated oxytocin concentration in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus, thalamic ventral nucleus, periaqueductal gray, raphe magnus nucleus, caudate nucleus, thoracic spinal cord and lumbar spinal cord, but did not alter oxytocin concentration in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, anterior pituitary, posterior pituitary and plasma. The data suggested that oxytocin in central nervous system rather than in peripheral organs is involved in acupuncture analgesia. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Yin and Yang of dopamine release: a new perspective	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						limbic system; prefrontal cortex; nucleus accumbens; cognitive functions; animal model; schizophrenia	RAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; IN-VIVO; WORKING-MEMORY; FIRING PATTERN; LIMBIC SYSTEM; IMPULSE FLOW; NEURONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MODULATION	Dopamine has undergone extensive investigation due to its known involvement in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In particular, studies into pathological conditions have focused on the roles of high amplitude, phasically evoked dopamine release in regions such as the prefrontal cortex and striatum. However, research has shown that dopamine release can be more complex than just phasic release; thus, there is also a tonic, background dopamine release, with alterations in tonic dopamine release likely having unique and important functional roles. Unfortunately, however, tonic dopamine release has received relatively little attention. In this review, we summarize our recent studies and discuss how modulation of the dopamine system, both in terms of phasic activation and attenuation of tonic dopamine are important for the functions of brain regions receiving this dopamine innervation, and that imbalances in these dopamine release mechanisms may play a significant role in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.

Focal gray matter changes in schizophrenia across the course of the illness: A 5-year follow-up study	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; MRI; follow-up; voxel-based morphometry; frontal lobe; antipsychotic medication	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; CHILDHOOD-ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; 1ST EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; CAUDATE NUCLEI VOLUMES; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; PROGRESSIVE DECREASE; BRAIN ABNORMALITIES; PSYCHOSIS; ADOLESCENCE; DIAGNOSIS	Recent volumetric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) studies have suggested brain volume changes in schizophrenia to be progressive in nature. Whether this is a global process or some brain areas are more affected than others is not known. In a 5-year longitudinal study, MRI whole brain scans were obtained from 96 patients with schizophrenia and 113 matched healthy comparison subjects. Changes over time in focal gray and white matter were measured with voxel-based morphometry throughout the brain. Over the 5-year interval, excessive decreases in gray matter density were found in patients in the left superior frontal area (Brodmann areas 9/10), left superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 42), right caudate nucleus, and right thalamus as compared to healthy individuals. Excessive gray matter density decrease in the superior frontal gray matter was related to increased number of hospitalizations, whereas a higher cumulative dose of clozapine and olanzapine during the scan interval was related to lesser decreases in this area. In conclusion, gray matter density loss occurs across the course of the illness in schizophrenia, predominantly in left frontal and temporal cortices. Moreover, the progression in left frontal density loss appears to be related to an increased number of psychotic episodes, with atypical antipsychotic medication attenuating these changes.

Neural substrates of blindsight after hemispherectomy	NEUROSCIENTIST			English	Review						blindsight; superior colliculus; hemispherectomized patients; S-cones; spatial summation effect; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VISUAL RESPONSE PROPERTIES; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; RESIDUAL VISION; STRIATE CORTEX; AREA MT; FUNCTIONAL HEMISPHERECTOMY; UNCONSCIOUS VISION; SPATIAL SUMMATION	Blindsight is a visual phenomenon whereby hemianopic patients are able to process visual information in their blind visual field without awareness. Previous research demonstrating the existence of blindsight in hemianopic patients has been criticized for the nature of the paradigms used, for the presence of methodological artifacts, and for the possibility that spared islands of visual cortex may have sustained the phenomenon because the patients generally had small circumscribed lesions. To respond to these criticisms, the authors have been investigating for several years now residual visual abilities in the blind field of hemispherectomized patients in whom a whole cerebral hemisphere has been removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain. These patients have offered a unique opportunity to establish the existence of blindsight and to investigate its underlying neuronal mechanisms because in these cases, spared islands of visual cortex cannot be evoked to explain the presence of visual abilities in the blind field. In addition, the authors have been using precise behavioral paradigms, strict control for potential methodological artifacts such as light scatter, fixation, criterion effects, and macular sparing, and they have utilized new neuroimaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging tractography to enhance their understanding of the phenomenon. The following article is a review of their research on the involvement of the superior colliculi in blindsight in hemispherectomized patients.

CDF Collaboration	Measurement of the p(p)over-bar -> t(t)over-bar production cross section and the top quark mass at root s=1.96 TeV in the all-hadronic decay mode	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PLUS JETS EVENTS; P(P)OVER-BAR COLLISIONS; ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER; PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; PBARP COLLISIONS; PAIR PRODUCTION; FERMILAB; DETECTOR; PHYSICS	We report the measurements of the t (t) over bar production cross section and of the top quark mass using 1.02 fb(-1) of p (p) over bar data collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. We select events with six or more jets on which a number of kinematical requirements are imposed by means of a neural network algorithm. At least one of these jets must be identified as initiated by a b-quark candidate by the reconstruction of a secondary vertex. The cross section is measured to be sigma(t (t) over bar)=8.3 +/- 1.0(stat)(-1.5)(+2.0)X(syst)+/- 0.5(lumi) pb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. The top quark mass of 174.0 +/- 2.2(stat)+/- 4.8(syst) GeV/c(2) is derived from a likelihood fit incorporating reconstructed mass distributions representative of signal and background.

D0 Collaboration	Measurement of the p(p)over-bar -> t(t)over-bar + X production cross section at root s=1.96 TeV in the fully hadronic decay channel	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PHYSICS	A measurement of the top quark pair production cross section in proton antiproton collisions at an interaction energy of root s=1.96 TeV is presented. This analysis uses 405 +/- 25 pb(-1) of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Fully hadronic t (t) over bar decays with final states of six or more jets are separated from the multijet background using secondary vertex tagging and a neural network. The t (t) over bar cross section is measured as sigma(t (t) over bar)=4.5(-1.9)(+2.0)(stat)(-1.1)(+1.4)(syst)+/- 0.3(lumi) pb for a top quark mass of m(t)=175 GeV/c(2).

Accordingly, we developed an organelle proteomic approach enabling the study of neurotransmission-related proteins in the prefrontal. cortex (PFC) of postpubertal (postnatal day 60 (PD60)) neonatally ventral hippocampal (nVH) lesioned rats, an extensively used neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia-like behaviors. The PFC was chosen because of its purported role in the etiology of the disease. Statistical analysis of 392 reproducible spots on 2-D organelle proteomic patterns revealed significant changes in intensity of 18 proteinous spots in plasma membrane-enriched fractions obtained from postpubertal nVH lesioned rats compared to controls. Mass spectrometric analysis and database searching allowed the identification of a single protein in each of the nine differential spots, including proteins of low abundance, such as neurocalcin delta. Most of the identified dysregulated proteins, including clathrin light chain B, syntaxin binding protein 1b and visinin-like protein 1 are known to be linked to various neurotransmitter systems and to play key roles in plasma membrane receptor expression and recycling as well as synaptic vesicle exocytosis /recycling. Organelle proteomic approaches have hence proved to be most useful to identify key proteins linked to a given behavior in animal models of brain diseases.

Object perception and masking: Contributions of sides and convexities	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						global shape; curvature; radial frequency; object recognition; masking	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; SHAPE-DISCRIMINATION; CONTOUR CURVATURE; AREA V4; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; STRIATE CORTEX	Object perception uses a variety of visual cues, including shape cues derived from sides and convexities. Two recent masking studies using radial frequency patterns have argued, respectively, for a predominant role of convexity [Habak, C., Wilkinson, F., Zakher, B., & Wilson, H. R. (2004). Curvature population coding for complex shapes in human vision. Vision Research, 44 (24), 2815-2823] or side information [Hess, R. F., Wang, Y. -Z., & Dakin, S. C. (1999). Are judgements of circularity local or global? Vision Research, 39, 4354-4360]. Here we resolve the controversy by separating the masks into their parts (e.g., convexities and sides), and measuring the relative masking influences of the different mask components. We found that both side and convexity information contribute to masking. However, masking due to side information was much less dependent on alignment compared to masking due to convexities. This supports a theory where convexities constitute a prime source of information for shape processing, and sides do also contribute but to a smaller extent. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is commonly suggested that the brain addresses these by first constructing representations of the world on which to build knowledge and make a decision, and then by computing and executing an action plan. However, neurophysiological data argue against this serial viewpoint. In contrast, it is proposed here that the brain processes sensory information to specify, in parallel, several potential actions that are currently available. These potential actions compete against each other for further processing, while information is collected to bias this competition until a single response is selected. The hypothesis suggests that the dorsal visual system specifies actions which compete against each other within the fronto- parietal cortex, while a variety of biasing influences are provided by prefrontal regions and the basal ganglia. A computational model is described, which illustrate show this competition may take place in the cerebral cortex. Simulations of the model capture qualitative features of neurophysiological data and reproduce various behavioural phenomena.

Distal truncation of KCC3 in non-french Canadian HMSN/ACC families	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CL COTRANSPORTER KCC3; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; ANDERMANN-SYNDROME; AGENESIS; NEUROPATHY; GENE	Background: Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC) is a severe and progressive autosomal recessive polyneuropathy. Mutations in the potassium-chloride cotransporter 3 gene (KCC3) were identified as responsible for HMSN/ACC in the French Canadian (FC) population. In the present study, the authors were interested in finding new mutations in non-FC populations, assessing the activity of mutant proteins and refining genotype-phenotype correlations. Methods: The authors screened KCC3 for mutations using direct sequencing in six non-FC HMSN/ACC families. They then assessed the functionality of the most common mutant protein using a flux assay in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Results: The authors identified mutations in exon 22 of KCC3: a novel mutation (del + 2994-3003; E1015X) in one family, as well as a known mutation (3031C -> T; R1011X) found in five unrelated families and associated with two different haplotypes. The function of the cotransporter was abolished, although a limited amount of mutant proteins were correctly localized at the membrane. Conclusions: KCC3 mutations in exon 22 constitute a recurrent mutation site for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC), regardless of ethnic origin, and are the most common cause of HMSN/ACC in the non-French Canadian (FC) families analyzed so far. Therefore, for genetic analysis, exon 22 screening should be prioritized in non-FC populations. Finally, the R1011X mutation leads to the abrogation of KCC3's function in Xenopus laevis oocytes, likely due to impaired transit of the cotransporter.

The EphA4 receptor regulates dendritic spine remodeling by affecting beta 1-integrin signaling pathways	JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; DOMAIN TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION; FOCAL-ADHESION-KINASE; SRC FAMILY KINASES; NMDA RECEPTOR; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; INTEGRIN FUNCTION; COMPLEX-FORMATION	Remodeling of dendritic spines is believed to modulate the function of excitatory synapses. We previously reported that the EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates spine morphology in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, but the signaling pathways involved were not characterized (Murai, K.K., L.N. Nguyen, F. Irie, Y. Yamaguchi, and E.B. Pasquale. 2003. Nat. Neurosci. 6: 153-160). In this study, we show that EphA4 activation by ephrin-A3 in hippocampal slices inhibits integrin downstream signaling pathways. EphA4 activation decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of the scaffolding protein Crk-associated substrate (Cas) and the tyrosine kinases focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and also reduces the association of Cas with the Src family kinase Fyn and the adaptor Crk. Consistent with this, EphA4 inhibits beta 1-integrin activity in neuronal cells. Supporting a functional role for beta 1 integrin and Cas inactivation downstream of EphA4, the inhibition of integrin or Cas function induces spine morphological changes similar to those associated with EphA4 activation. Furthermore, preventing beta 1-integrin inactivation blocks the effects of EphA4 on spines. Our results support a model in which EphA4 interferes with integrin signaling pathways that stabilize dendritic spines, thus modulating synaptic interactions with the extracellular environment.

There is now evidence that suggests expression of this transporter at several subcellular sites, including the nucleus, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus. This study investigated the localization and expression of P-glycoprotein at the nuclear membrane of rat brain microvessel endothelial (RBE4) and microglial (MLS-9) cell lines. Immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscope levels using P-glycoprotein monoclonals antibodies demonstrated the localization of the protein at the nuclear envelope of RBE4 and MLS-9 cells. Western blot analysis revealed a single band of 170-kDa in purified nuclear membranes prepared from isolated nuclei of RBE4 and MLS-9 cells. These findings indicate that P-glycoprotein is expressed at the nuclear envelope of rat brain cells and suggest a role in multidrug resistance at this subcellular site. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The family of MMPs includes 23 proteinases, including six membrane type-MMPs (MT-MMPs). Leukocyte infiltration is an integral part of the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammation in the CNS, as occurs in multiple sclerosis and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), as well as in the response to brain trauma and injury. We have previously shown that gene expression of the majority of MMPs was upregulated in the spinal cord of SJL mice with severe EAE induced by adoptive transfer of myelin basic protein reactive T cells, whereas four of the six MT-MMPs ( MMP-15, 16, 17 and 24) were downregulated. The two remaining MT-MMPs (MMP-14 and 25) were upregulated in whole tissue. Methods: We used in vivo models of CNS inflammation and injury to study expression of MT-MMP and cytokine mRNA by real-time RT-PCR. Expression was also assessed in microglia sorted from CNS by flow cytometry, and in primary microglia cultures following treatment with IFN gamma. Results: We now confirm the expression pattern of MT-MMPs in the B6 mouse, independent of effects of adjuvant. We further show expression of all the MT-MMPs, except MMP-24, in microglia. Microglia isolated from mice with severe EAE showed statistically significant downregulation of MMP-15, 17 and 25 and lack of increase in levels of other MT-MMPs. Downregulation of MT-MMPs was also apparent following CNS injury. The pattern of regulation of MT-MMPs in neuroinflammation showed no association with expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF alpha, IL-l beta, or IFN gamma. Conclusion: CNS inflammation and injury leads to downregulation in expression of the majority of MT-MMPs. Microglia in EAE showed a general downregulation of MT-MMPs, and our findings suggest that MT-MMP levels may inversely correlate with microglial reactivity.

Gray matter differences correlate with spontaneous strategies in a human virtual navigation task	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						spatial memory; hippocampus; caudate nucleus; virtual environment; response learning; basal ganglia	CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; MEMORY-SYSTEMS; HUMAN BRAIN; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTICES; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS; DORSAL STRIATUM; MACAQUE MONKEY; TAXI DRIVERS; MRI DATA	Young healthy participants spontaneously use different strategies in a virtual radial maze, an adaptation of a task typically used with rodents. Functional magnetic resonance imaging confirmed previously that people who used spatial memory strategies showed increased activity in the hippocampus, whereas response strategies were associated with activity in the caudate nucleus. Here, voxel based morphometry was used to identify brain regions covarying with the navigational strategies used by individuals. Results showed that spatial learners had significantly more gray matter in the hippocampus and less gray matter in the caudate nucleus compared with response learners. Furthermore, the gray matter in the hippocampus was negatively correlated to the gray matter in the caudate nucleus, suggesting a competitive interaction between these two brain areas. In a second analysis, the gray matter of regions known to be anatomically connected to the hippocampus, such as the amygdala, parahippocampal, perirhinal, entorhinal and orbitofrontal cortices were shown to covary with gray matter in the hippocampus. Because low gray matter in the hippocampus is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, these results have important implications for intervention programs that aim at functional recovery in these brain areas. In addition, these data suggest that spatial strategies may provide protective effects against degeneration of the hippocampus that occurs with normal aging.

Behavioral thresholds for negative phonotaxis in response to ultrasound stimuli are lower for long-winged (i.e. flight-capable) crickets than for short-winged (flight-incapable) individuals, whereas thresholds for positive phonotaxis in response to a calling-song model do not differ. Similarly, thresholds of the identified interneurons ON1 and AN2 differ between flight morphs for high sound frequencies but not for the frequency of calling song. Our results show that sensitivity to ultrasound is closely linked to flight ability, and thus to the risk of predation from aerially hawking bats. We suggest that sensitivity to ultrasound is one of a suite of flight-associated characteristics, the development of which may be under common hormonal regulation.

However, the role of the PPC in working memory is not understood and, although there is strong evidence that the MDLFC is involved in the monitoring of information in working memory, it is also often stated that it is involved in the manipulation of such information. This event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared brain activity during the performance of working memory trials in which either monitoring or manipulation of information was required. The results show that the PPC is centrally involved in manipulation processes, whereas activation of the MDLFC is related to the monitoring of the information that is being manipulated. This study provides dissociation of activation in these two regions and, thus, succeeds in further specifying their relative contribution to working memory.

Here we examined the activation of Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) following exposure to a CS previously paired with either paced or nonpaced copulation. Ovariectomized, hormone-primed rats received 10 sequential conditioning trials at 4-day intervals. In experiment 1, females in the odor-paired group learned to associate an almond odor on a male with paced copulation and an unscented male with nonpaced copulation. In the odor-unpaired group, females received the opposite association. In experiment 2, females associated two different strains of male, Long-Evans or Wistar, with paced or nonpaced copulation, respectively. A preference test indicated that females in both experiments developed a conditioned preference for the pacing-related males, as indicated by significantly more solicitations toward the male and a preference to copulate with the pacing-related male. Subsequently, females were exposed to the CS (odor or strain) alone for 1 h prior to kill and preparation of their brains for immunocytochemistry. In both experiments, the CS associated with paced copulation produced significantly more Fos-IR in the piriform cortex, medial preoptic area, and ventral tegmental area, relative to the same odor or strain cues associated with nonpaced copulation. These findings provide evidence that the state associated with paced copulation can be conditioned to environmental stimuli such as neutral odors or strain cues, which earn an incentive value via classical conditioning. The significance of the brain areas activated is discussed with regard to their role in sexual and other motivated behaviors. (c) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we show that serotonin(4) (5-HT4) agonists reduce immobility in the forced swimming test, displaying an antidepressant potential. Moreover, a 3 day regimen with such compounds modifies rat brain parameters considered to be key markers of antidepressant action, but that are observed only after 2-3 week treatments with classical molecules: desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, increased tonus on hippocampal postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, and enhanced phosphorylation of the CREB protein and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In contrast, a 3 day treatment with the SSRI citalopram remains devoid of any effect on these parameters. Finally, a 3 day regimen with the 5-HT4 agonist RS 67333 was sufficient to reduce both the hyperlocomotion induced by olfactory bulbectomy and the diminution of sucrose intake consecutive to a chronic mild stress. These findings point out 5-HT4 receptor agonists as a putative class of antidepressants with a rapid onset of action.

Neurofilaments, a prominent component of the neuronal cytoskeleton, are required by axons to support their normal radial growth. To distinguish between fiber features that arise in response to absolute axon caliber and those that are under autonomous control, we investigated transgenic mice in which neurofilaments are sequestered in neuronal cell bodies. The neurofilament deficient axons in such mice achieve mature calibers only 50% of normal and have altered conduction properties. We show here that this primary axonal defect also induces multiple changes in myelin sheath composition and radial dimensions. Remarkably, other fundamental fiber features, including internodal spacing and the architecture and composition of nodes of Ranvier, remain unaltered. Thus, many fiber characteristics are controlled through mechanisms operating independently of absolute axon caliber and the neurofilament cytoskeleton.

Morphological characterization of spinal cord dorsal horn lamina I neurons projecting to the parabrachial nucleus in the rat	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						substance P; nociception; retrograde labeling; confocal; neurokinin 1 receptor	SUBSTANCE-P RECEPTOR; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; NEUROKININ-1 RECEPTOR; STRUCTURAL TYPES; SPINOTHALAMIC NEURONS; NOCICEPTIVE PROCESSES; PAIN PROCESSES; TRACT NEURONS; C-FOS; CAT	Many Rexed's lamina I neurons are nociceptive and project to the brain. Lamina I projection neurons can be classified as multipolar, fusiform, or pyramidal, based on cell body shape and characteristics of their proximal dendrites in the horizontal plane. There is also evidence that both multipolar and fusiform cells are nociceptive and pyramidal neurons nonnociceptive. In this investigation we identified which types of lamina I neurons belong to the spinoparabrachial tract in the rat and characterized them regarding the presence or absence of neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1r) immunoreactivity. For this, cholera toxin subunit B (CTb), conjugated to a fluorescent marker was injected unilaterally into the parabrachial nucleus. Sections were additionally stained for the detection of NK-1r immunoreactivity and were examined using fluorescence and confocal microscopy. Serial confocal optical sections and 3D reconstructions were obtained for a considerable number of neurons per animal. Using immunofluorescence, we assessed the proportion of lamina I neurons belonging to the spinoparabrachial (SPB) tract and/or expressing NK-1r. The relative distribution of neurons belonging to the SPB tract was: 38.7% multipolar, 36.8% fusiform, 22.7% pyramidal, and 1.9% unclassified. Most of the SPB neurons expressing NK-1r were either multipolar or fusiform. Pyramidal SPB neurons were seldom immunoreactive for NK-1r, an observation that provides further support to the concept that most lamina I projection neurons of the pyramidal type are nonnociceptive. In addition, our study provides further evidence that these distinct morphological types of neurons differ in their phenotypic properties, but not in their projection patterns.

To estimate whether congenital amusia can be genetically transmitted, its prevalence was quantified by direct auditory testing of 71 members of 9 large families of amusic probands, as well as of 75 members of 10 control families. The results confirm that congenital amusia is expressed by a deficit in processing musical pitch but not musical time and also show that the pitch disorder has a hereditary component. In amusic families, 39% of first-degree relatives have the same cognitive disorder, whereas only 3% have it in the control families. The identification of multiplex families with a high relative risk of experiencing a musical pitch deficit (lambda(s) = 10.8; 95% confidence interval 8-13.5) enables the mapping of genetic loci for hereditary amusia.

Long-term outcome of Leigh syndrome caused by the NARP-T8993C mtDNA mutation	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A			English	Article						NARP; Leigh syndrome; ATPase-6; long-term outcome	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA MUTATIONS; T8993C MUTATION; NARP MUTATION; NUCLEOTIDE 8993; ATPASE-6 GENE; FAMILY; IMPAIRMENT; PHENOTYPE; APOPTOSIS; DIAGNOSIS	Mutations at mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) nucleotide 8993 can cause neurogenic weakness, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP syndrome), or maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (LS), with a cot-relation between the amount of mutant mtDNA and the severity of the neurological disease. The T8993C mutation is generally considered to be clinically milder than the T8993G mutation but when the level of heteroplasmy exceeds 90%, progressive neurodegeneration has been found. We report on a long-term follow-Lip of a patient who presented at 4 years of age with typical LS but showed an unexpected resolution of his symptoms and a favorable outcome. At 18 years of age, his neurological examination was near normal, with neither peripheral neuropathy nor retinopathy. mtDNA analysis identified the presence of T8993C mutation at high level (> 95%) in the patient's blood leukocytes. This case report and literature review emphasizes the variability of the phenotypic expression of the T8993C mutation and the need for caution in predictive counseling in such patients.

The venous distension sign: A diagnostic sign of intracranial hypotension at MR imaging of the brain	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							SPINAL-FLUID HYPOVOLEMIA; CSF VOLUME DEPLETION; LUMBAR PUNCTURE; ENHANCEMENT; HEADACHE; MENINGEAL; PRESSURE; FEATURES	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with intracranial hypotension (IH) demonstrate intracranial venous enlargement with a characteristic change in contour of the transverse sinus seen on routine T1 -weighted sagittal imaging. In IH, the inferior margin of the midportion of the dominant transverse sinus acquires a distended convex appearance; we have termed this the venous distension sign (VDS). This is distinct from the normal appearance of this segment, which usually has a slightly concave or straight lower margin. This sign is introduced, and its performance as a test for the presence of this disease is evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The transverse sinuses on T1-weighted sagittal imaging of 15 patients with 1H and 15 control patients were independently assessed in a blinded fashion by 3 readers for the presence of a VDS. A present or absent VDS was determined for each patient by each reader, and a consensus result for each patient was determined by unanimity or majority rule. RESULTS: Using the VIDS, the readers correctly identified 93% (14 of 15) of the 1H patients and similarly 93% (14 of 15) of the control patients. There was a high rate of agreement among the readers for the interpretation of the VIDS (multirater kappa = 0.82). The overall sensitivity of the VDS for the diagnosis of intracranial hypotension was 94%. Specificity was also 94%. CONCLUSION: The VIDS appears to be an accurate test for the presence or absence of IH and may be helpful in the evaluation of these patients.

Such a network was implemented in the Pays de la Loire region in 2003. Our objective is to evaluate the feasibility and the capacity to detect infants with an incapacitating condition at nine months corrected age and the parents' satisfaction with such a network. Material and methods. - A common tool based on the Amiel Tison assessment was set up. Infants included since 1 It March 2003 and who were two years old corrected age on 1(st) September 2006 were taken into consideration. A satisfaction survey was conducted with the parents of infants showing normal development at two years old corrected age or with an abnormal neuromotor examination. Results. - Amongst the 1339 infants included, 1185 (88.4 %) were seen at the age of two years: 7.3 % showed pathological development, 4.5 % infants showed suspect neuromotor examination. Cares were proposed for 11 % of the infants followed, permitting cares from nine months old for 65 % of the infants considered as having a pathological development at the age of two years. Discussion/conclusion. - This follow-up network has fulfilled its initial goal: 2.2 % of newbom babies in the region were included, a low rate of lost for follow-up was observed. Moreover, this network has a relative good capacity for detection and early initiation of care. The implication of the parents is important and their level of satisfaction appeared to be high. This experiment shows that regional follow-up networks can become reality, but their efficiency still needs to be improved. (C) 2007 Elsevier-Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

Previous studies have indicated that some memory processes may be more affected than others. Objective: To examine the neural correlates of 3 specific memory processes in FEP by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI). Design: Case-control study. Setting: Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychoses of the Douglas Hospital and Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University. Subjects: Twenty-six patients with FEP and 20 healthy controls. Main Outcome Measures: Behavioral performance and regional brain activity measured during memory encoding by fMRI. Our fMRI design included 3 within-subject contrasts ( associative vs item-oriented encoding, encoding of arbitrary vs semantically related image pairs, and successful vs unsuccessfulmemoryencoding) that were then used for group conjunctions and between-group analyses. Results: Patients with FEP showed normal activation of several brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and parahippocampal cortex, during successful memory encoding and associative encoding. In contrast, the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal areas showed reduced activity during the encoding of arbitrary pairs. This selective dysfunction reflected by abnormal brain activation during encoding was accompanied by a greater deficit for subsequent recognition of arbitrary pairs relative to the semantically related pairs. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that, in the same group of patients with FEP, the hippocampus could show either normal or abnormal modulation of activation depending on the specific cognitive process that was examined. The normal modulation of hippocampal activation observed during successful memory encoding in FEP argues against a general inability to recruit this region. Instead, the dysfunction was specifically linked to semantic relatedness. This selective deficit seems to affect memory performance in FEP and denotes an important representational problem that may confer greater vulnerability to psychotic disorders and would thus be interesting to examine in high-risk populations.

Several reviews have addressed the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the pathophysiology of BD, whereas little attention has been given to the role of the hippocampus. This study critically reviews data from brain imaging, postmortem, neuropsychological, and preclinical studies, which suggested hippocampal abnormalities in BD. Most of the structural brain imaging studies did not find changes in hippocampal volume in BD, although a few studies suggested that anatomical changes might be restricted to the psychotic, pediatric, or unmedicated BD subgroups. Functional imaging studies showed abnormal brain activation in the hippocampus and its closely related regions during emotional, attentional, and memory tasks. This is consistent with neuropsychological findings that revealed a wide range of cognitive disturbances during acute mood episodes and a significant impairment in declarative memory during remission. Postmortem studies indicate abnormal glutamate and GABA transmission in the hippocampus of BD patients, whereas data from preclinical studies suggest that the regulation of hippocampal plasticity and survival might be associated with the therapeutic effects of mood stabilizers. In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that the hippocampus plays an important role in the pathophysiology of BD.

Oscillations between 250 and 500 Hz, or fast ripples (FR), appeared related to the epileptic focus whereas ripples (80-200 Hz) were not. We report high-frequency oscillations recorded with intracranial macroelectrodes in seven patients with refractory focal epilepsy during slow-wave sleep. We characterize the relation of fast oscillations to the seizure focus and quantify their concordance with epileptiform transients, with which they are strongly associated. The patients were selected because interictal spikes were found within and outside the seizure onset zone. Visual inspection was used to identify and classify the ripples and FRs according to their relation to epileptiform spikes. Continuous-time wavelet analysis was used to compute their power. Ripples were present in all patients while FRs where found in five of the seven patients. Most ripples and FRs occurred at the same time as epileptiform transients. The rate of occurrence of ripples was higher within the seizure onset zone than outside in four of seven patients. The rate of FRs was much higher within the seizure onset zone than outside in four of the five patients with FRs ( in these four patients, FRs were almost inexistent outside the seizure onset zone). The power of ripples and FRs tended to be higher in the electrodes where their rate was also higher. These results indicate that FRs were more restricted to the electrodes located within the seizure onset zone, especially to the hippocampus, than ripples. In only one patient, FRs were more frequent outside the seizure onset zone; this patient was the only one with cortical dysplasia and the electrode with a high rate of FRs was inside the lesion. This study demonstrates that interictal ripples and FRs can be recorded with depth macroelectrodes in patients. Most occur at the time of epileptiform spikes but some are isolated. Ripples do not show a clear differentiation between the seizure onset zone and remote areas, whereas FRs have a higher rate and higher power in the seizure onset zone. Our results also suggest a special capacity of the abnormal hippocampus to generate FRs, although they were also recorded in other structures.

This study tested the beneficial effects of the non-peptide and orally active kinin B-1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 against tactile and cold allodynia in a rat model of insulin resistance. Experimental approach: Rats were fed with 10% D-glucose for 12 weeks and effects of orally administered SSR240612 ( 0.3 - 30 mg kg(-1) ) were determined on the development of tactile and cold allodynia. Possible interference of SSR240612 with vascular oxidative stress and pancreatic function was also addressed. Key results: Glucose- fed rats exhibited tactile and cold allodynia, increases in systolic blood pressure and higher plasma levels of insulin and glucose, at 12 weeks. SSR240612 blocked tactile and cold allodynia at 3 h ( ID50 = 5.5 and 7.1 mg kg(-1), respectively) in glucose-fed rats but had no effect in control rats. The antagonist ( 10 mg kg(-1)) had no effect on plasma glucose and insulin, insulin resistance ( HOMA index) and aortic superoxide anion production in glucose-fed rats. Conclusions and implications: We provide the first evidence that the B-1 receptors are involved in allodynia in an experimental rat model of insulin resistance. Allodynia was alleviated by SSR240612 most likely through a direct inhibition of B-1 receptors affecting spinal cord and/or sensory nerve excitation. Thus, orally active non-peptide B-1 receptor antagonists should have clinical therapeutic potential in the treatment of sensory polyneuropathy.

The diagnostic yield and utility of this practice has seldom been called into question. This critical appraisal will review the practice of listening for a carotid artery bruit (CAB) in suspected stroke patients and analyze its clinical utility, including the sensitivity and specificity of a CAB for detecting a significant lesion and the potential impact a CAB may have on the investigation and disposition of such patients.

Children with high-risk neuroblastomas (NB) potentially may benefit from treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo). Epo is a stimulator of erythropoiesis, acting through its receptor (EpoR). The objective of the current study was to evaluate expression levels of Epo and EpoR in NB and in 4 normal tissues and their effects on the proliferation of tumor cells. METHODS. A tissue microarray study was performed with 101 primary tumors, 39 paired metastases, 56 paired control tissues, and 6 human NB cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against Epo and EpoR. Immunostaining intensity was evaluated by using a semiquantitative score based on the percentage of positive cells. An in vitro analysis of cell proliferation and cell cycle in the presence of recombinant Epo was performed in the 6 cell lines. RESULTS. The expression of EpoR was found to be significantly higher in tumors than in paired control tissues (P <.0001) compared with the expression of Epo (P =.06), and the expression of EpoR was significantly higher in lymph node metastases than in paired primary tumors (P= .02) compared with Epo (P =.99). Survival analysis demonstrated that the patients who had tumors with the highest expression of EpoR had a significantly better overall survival (P = .03). In the in vitro study, recombinant Epo did not modify proliferation and cell cycle in the cell lines regardless of the EpoR expression level. CONCLUSIONS. Epo and EpoR were expressed in NB but did not modify tumor cell proliferation. The results of the current study suggested that Epo may be 2007 American Cancer Society.

We therefore tested macaque monkeys on a task that was originally developed to study such active controlled memory retrieval in human subjects and we were able to demonstrate that monkeys, like human subjects, can retrieve, upon command, specific components of previously encoded events. Furthermore, following earlier functional neuroimaging work with human subjects showing the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to be involved in such active controlled retrieval, we recorded single-neuron activity within this region of the monkey brain while the monkeys performed the active retrieval task. Neuronal responses were related to the retrieval and the decision whether the retrieved information was the instructed one. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, an impressive capacity by macaque monkeys for controlled memory retrieval and, in addition, provide neurophysiological evidence about the role of the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in such controlled retrieval.

Disruption of this equilibrium has severe consequences that affect multiple systems and may be fatal. Genetic analysis of pituitary function led to discovery of critical transcription factors that cause hormone deficiencies when mis-expressed. This review will summarize recent findings that led to the first complete clinical description of inherited, isolated corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency (IAD) and to the first molecular mechanism for excessive ACTH production in Cushing's disease. Indeed, mutations in TPIT, a positive or negative regulator of cell fates for different pituitary lineages, cause neonatal IAD, a condition considered anecdotic before discovery of this transcription factor. Cushing's disease is caused by corticotroph adenomas that produce excess ACTH as a result of resistance to glucocorticoids (Gc). Molecular investigation of the normal mechanism of Gc feedback led to identification of two essential proteins for pro-opiomelanocortin repression that are often mis-expressed in corticotroph adenomas thus providing a molecular explanation for Gc resistance. These two proteins, Brg1 and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), are involved in chromatin remodeling and may also participate in the tumorigenic process, as Brg1 is a tumor suppressor. These recent advances have provided improved diagnosis and opened new perspectives for patient management and therapies.

This point is important because recent evidence suggests th at female athletes are at greater risk of sustaining a concussion. Design: We assessed cognitive functioning after a first concussion n female soccer players, 6 to 8 months after their injury. The first-time concussed athletes were compared with a group of age-matched teammates who had never experienced a concussion. Setting and Participants: A total of 22 female university-level soccer players participated in the study. Main Outcome Measurements: Paper-and-pencil and computcrized tasks were used to assess different neuropsycliological functions. Results: Short- and long-term verbal memory, attention, and simrle reaction time were non-nal. In contrast, compared with the contiol group, the concussed athletes were significantly slower on tasks ttat required decision making (complex reaction time), inhibition and flexibility (Stroop), and planning (Tour of London task). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that cognitive functions related to cognitive processing speed are most vulnerable to a sports-related concussion and are still impaired for a half year afcr injury in university-level female soccer players.

Among many hypotheses, the neuroendocrine hypothesis involving a melatonin deficiency as the source for AIS generated the greatest interest and controversy since no decrease in circulating melatonin level has been observed in a majority of studies. Previously, we have reconciled the role of melatonin in AIS by demonstrating a melatonin signaling dysfunction occurring in osteoblasts derived from AIS patients, which contrasted with similar cells isolated from healthy subjects. We found that this difference is caused in AIS cells by increased phosphorylation of serine residues affecting the activity of G inhibitory proteins normally associated with melatonin cell surface receptors. Here we propose a preliminary molecular classirication of patients with AIS based on the cellular response to the melatonin (cAMP) and distinct protein-protein interactions. These interactions include those between protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) and MT2 melatonin receptors or PKC delta and the receptor for activated protein C kinase 1. This finding could help in future molecular classification of patients with AIS.

We have established that in addition to "target-derived" NGF neurotrophic stimulation, cholinergic neurons also respond dose-dependently, to intra-parenchymal NGF administration in the somato-dendritic region of the nucleus Basalis [1], thus illustrating the potential of alternative reparative therapies which would by-pass the undesirable effects of diffuse neurotrophin application. Moreover, our lab has also observed that the steady-state number of cortical cholinergic synapses is dependent on continuous NGF supply, as anti-NGF monoclonal antibodies and TrkA receptor antagonists deplete pre-existing cholinergic bouton numbers [2]. Furthermore, the application of either NGF or TrkA NGF-mimetic agonists successfully rescues the age-dependent loss of cortical cholinergic boutons in aged-impaired rats [3]. The vulnerability of the cortical cholinergic system has also been demonstrated in transgenic animal models of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid pathology [4-6]. It is of interest to note however, that an up-regulation of cholinergic presynaptic boutons has been observed in certain transgenic mouse models prior to plaque formation [6]. This observation is similar to the visibly increased immunoreactivity of cortical and hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) fibers in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, [7]). A series of ex-vivo experiments conducted by our group have demonstrated that contrary to popular belief, proNGF, as opposed to mature NGF, is released from the cerebral cortex in an activity-dependent manner. In addition, proNGF appears to be released with a series of pro-enzymes and enzymes, which are involved in its subsequent maturation to NGF and degradation in the extracellular space [8]. Given that proNGF is known to be upregulated in AD patients [9] a dysregulation in the maturation or degradation of mature NGF might explain the preferential vulnerability of the cholinergic system in the AD pathology.

The safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effects of Alzherned were assessed in a double-blind study in which 58 individuals with mild-to-moderate AD (MMSE 13-25) were randomized to receive placebo or Alzhemed 50, 100 or 150 mg BID for 3 months. At the end of the double-blind phase, 42 of these subjects entered a 36-month open-label (OL) phase in which they received Alzhemed 150 mg BID. Assessments included plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzhemed concentrations, CSF levels of A beta, as well as cognitive (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination) and clinical performance (Clinical Dementia Rating scale, Sum-of-Boxes) measures. Alzhemed was safe and well tolerated, crossed the blood-brain barrier, and dose-dependently reduced CSF A beta 42 levels after 3 months of treatment. Mild AD subjects (MMSE 19-25 at entry) displayed greater reduction of CSF A beta(42) levels than moderate AD participants (MMSE 13-18 at entry). There was no effect of Alzhemed on the cognitive or clinical measures after 3 months of treatment. The OL follow-up suggested a stabilization of cognitive function especially in mild AD subjects over the 36-month study-period.,Alzhemed thus appears to be well tolerated with long-term exposure and reduces CSF A beta(42) levels in mild-to-moderate AD subjects. These findings will be discussed in the context of two large-scale randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials that are currently being conducted to test the long-term safety and efficacy of Alzhemed.

Alterations in GSH metabolism are becoming the focus of attention in many diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and AIDS. As such, a rapid assessment of GSH levels in a clinical setting is of increasing importance. We tested the efficacy of the thiol-labeling fluorescent dye CM-SNARF in its ability to measure variations in GSH concentration using a visible-light flow cytometer. GSH levels in 183, Jurkat, and primary lymphocytes were depleted with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or diamide, or increased with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Following each treatment, cells were divided and either labeled with CM-SNARF followed by flow cytometry analysis, or assayed for GSH using a biochemical method. BSO treatment caused a maximal 87-90% decrease in GSH and 68-76% decrease in fluorescence units. Diamide depleted GSH 91-95%, corresponding to a fluorescence decrease of 85-88%. NAC treatment increased GSH levels 27% and fluorescence 12-19%. The overall correlation (R 2) between mean GSH concentration and mean fluorescence was 0.80-0.88.

J	Lepage, JF; Theoret, H				Lepage, Jean-Francois; Theoret, Hugo			The mirror neuron system: grasping others' actions from birth?	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							EXECUTION MATCHING SYSTEM; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; LIGHT BIOLOGICAL MOTION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; PREMOTOR CORTEX; EARLY INFANCY; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; MOTOR FACILITATION; ACTION RECOGNITION; TONGUE PROTRUSION	In the adult human brain, the presence of a system matching the observation and the execution of actions is well established. This mechanism is thought to rely primarily on the contribution of so-called 'mirror neurons', cells that are active when a specific gesture is executed as well as when it is seen or heard. Despite the wealth of evidence detailing the existence of a mirror neuron system (MNS) in the adult brain, little is known about its normal development. Yet, a better understanding of the MNS in infants would be of considerable theoretical and clinical interest, as dysfunctions within the MNS have been demonstrated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder. Arguments in favor of an innate, or very early, mechanism underlying action understanding mainly come from studies of neonatal imitation, the existence of which has been questioned by some. Here, we review evidence suggesting the presence of an MNS in the human child, as well as work that suggests, although indirectly, the existence of a mechanism matching the perception and the execution of actions in the human newborn.

Current treatment options are limited to mainly symptomatic treatments. Thus, new and efficient drug targets are needed, and therefore we performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on NPC and healthy fibroblasts to identify globally affected pathways in NPC that could serve as targets for later drug discovery programs. Cell lines were characterized by analyzing cellular concentrations of cholesterol, its precursors and metabolites, as well as cellular plant sterol levels. Gene expression analyses were performed with Sentrix (R) Human-8 Expression BeadChips, analyzing 23,000 transcripts. Pathway analysis of the expression data was performed using the GSEA method. Twenty-seven upregulated and 33 downregulated pathways emerged as globally affected in the GSEA analysis. These pathways included, for example, mitochondrial pathway, caspase cascade, as well as prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolism. Based on the present results and earlier published data, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic treatment could be beneficial in NPC.

However, apart from being invasive, this technique is not applicable in young children or patients who present mental retardation and/or language deficits. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is increasingly employed as a non-invasive alternative. Again, this method is more difficult to use with young children, especially hyperactive ones, since they have to remain motionless during data acquisition. The aim of this study was to determine whether near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used as an alternative technique to investigate language lateralization in children and special populations. Unlike Wada test, NIRS is non-invasive, and it is more tolerant to movement artefacts than fMRI. In the present study, NIRS data were acquired in four epileptic children, a 12-year-old boy with pervasive developmental disorder and a 3-year-old, healthy child, as well as three healthy and two epileptic adults, while they performed a verbal fluency task and a control task. When applicable, the results were compared to the subjects' fMRI and/or IAT findings. Clear laterality of speech was obtained in all participants, including the two non-epileptic children, and NIRS results matched fMRI and [AT findings. These results, if replicable in larger samples, are encouraging and suggest that NIRS has the potential to become a viable, non-invasive alternative to IAT and fMRI in the determination of speech lateralization in children and clinical populations that cannot be submitted to more invasive techniques.

Phenylketonuria (PKU), a Mendelian autosomal recessive phenotype, was identified in 1934 by Asbjorn Folling. It is a disease with impaired postnatal cognitive development resulting from a neurotoxic effect of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Its metabolic phenotype is accountable to multifactorial origins both in nurture, where the normal nutritional experience introduces L-phenylalanine, and in nature, where mutations (> 500 alleles) occur in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) on chromosome 12q23.2 encoding the L-phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme (EC 1.14.16.1). The PAH enzyme converts phenylalanine to tyrosine in the presence of molecular oxygen and catalytic amounts of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), its nonprotein cofactor. PKU is among the first of the human genetic diseases to enter, through newborn screening, the domain of public health, and to show a treatment effect. This effect caused a paradigm shift in attitudes about genetic disease. The PKU story contains many messages, including: a framework on which to appreciate the complexity of PKU in which phenotype reflects both locus-specific and genomic components; what the human PAH gene tells us about human population genetics and evolution of modern humans; and how our interest in PKU is served by a locus,specific mutation database (http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca; last accessed 20 March 2007). The individual Mendelian PKU phenotype has no "simple" or single explanation; every patient has her/his own complex PKU phenotype and will be treated accordingly. Knowledge about PKU reveals genomic components of both disease and health.

This bioamplifier achieves reduced-size compared to previous designs by means of active low-frequency suppression. An active integrator located in the feedback path of a low-noise amplifier is employed for placing a highpass cutoff frequency within the transfer function. A very long integrating time constant is achieved using a small integrated capacitor and a MOS-bipolar equivalent resistor. This configuration rejects unwanted low-frequency contents without the need for input RC networks or large feedback capacitors. Therefore, the bioamplifier high-input impedance and small size are preserved. The bioamplifier, implemented in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process, has been designed for neural recording of action potentials, and optimised through a transconductance-efficiency design methodology for micropower operation. Measured performance and results obtained from in vivo recordings are presented. The integrated bioamplifier provides a midband gain of 50 dB, and achieves an input-referred noise of 5.6 mu Vrms. It occupies less than 0.050 mm(2) of chip area and dissipates 8.6 mu W.

Methods Three feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) have been developed for the estimation of tumour characteristics. Each network provides one of the three parameters of the tumour, i.e. diameter, depth and tumour: tissue stiffness ratio. A resilient back-propagation (RP) algorithm with a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation approach is used for training purposes. Results The proposed inverse approach based on neural networks is a reliable and efficient tool for diagnostic tests in order to accurately estimate the basic parameters of the tumour in the tissue. Conclusion There is a non-linear correlation between the tumour characteristics and their effects on the extracted features. In general, reliable estimation of tumour stiffness is obtained when the depth of tumour is small. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Structural alterations of epididymal epithelial cells in cathepsin A-deficient mice affect the blood-epididymal barrier and lead to altered sperm motility	JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY			English	Article						epididymis; principal cells; sperm counts; lanthanum nitrate; claudins	TIGHT JUNCTION STRANDS; LYSOSOMAL PROTECTIVE PROTEIN; RAT EPIDIDYMIS; EXPRESSION; CLAUDINS; SPERMATOZOA; GALACTOSIALIDOSIS; TESTIS; NEURAMINIDASE; TRANSPORT	Past studies have shown that the epithelial lining of the epididymis in adult mice deficient in protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA -/-) becomes swollen and vacuolated as a result of an accumulation of pale lysosomes, some very large, in addition to the presence of an abundance of macrophages infiltrating the intertubular spaces. The purpose of this study was to assess the integrity of the epididymal epithelial-blood barrier in these altered mice by characterizing the distribution of claudins (Cldns) and the leakiness of tight junctions to lanthanum nitrate. A second goal was to characterize sperm motility behavior in PPCA -/- mice using computer-assisted sperm analyses (CASA). The results indicated that lanthanum nitrate penetrated apical junctional complexes between adjacent epithelial cells and entered the epididymal lumen in PPCA -/- mice but not in control PPCA +/+ mice. Immunostaining for Cldns 1, 3, 8, and 10 revealed unique patterns of expression based on cell type and region specificity in PPCA +/+ mice, which were much different in PPCA -/- mice. PPCA -/- mice showed reduced intensities of immunoreactions, complete absence of immunoreactions, and appearance of atypical cytoplasmic immunoreactions. CASA indicated that sperm counts in the PPCA -/- mice were 70% reduced, and among other problems, there was a fourfold higher percentage of static sperm in PPCA -/- mice compared with controls. These results suggest that PPCA deficiency causes structural changes to the blood-epididymal barrier as evidenced by lanthanum nitrate and Cldns expression that affects the luminal environment of the epididymis, resulting in altered sperm motility.

Methods GPx, GRx and POx levels were measured in 48 brain tumors obtained during surgery and 15 normal brain tissues that were collected during autopsy. Results were compared between two groups. Results GPx and GRx activities were significantly lower in GBM and TM when compared to controls and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0001). Furthermore, the decrease in enzyme activities was more evident in GBM than in TM. In contrast, POx levels were found to be higher in both GBM and TM compared to controls and showed statistically significant difference (P = 0.00001). Increase in POx levels was clearer in GBM than TM. Conclusions GPx and GRx decreased and POx increased significantly in both GBM and TM when compared to normal brain tissues. Further, clinical studies with a larger patient population are required to show the role(s) of antioxidant enzymes in brain tumors more accurately.

J	Andujar, JE; Drew, T				Andujar, Jacques-Etienne; Drew, Trevor			Organization of the projections from the posterior parietal cortex to the rostral and caudal regions of the motor cortex of the cat	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						motor control; visuomotor; dextran amines; retrograde tracers	IPSILATERAL CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; C3-C4 PROPRIOSPINAL NEURONS; TRACERS FAST BLUE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; FLUORESCENT TRACERS; FRONTAL-LOBE; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS	The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is an important source of input to the motor cortex in both the primate and the cat. However, the available evidence from the cat suggests that the projection from the PPC to those rostral areas of the motor cortex that project to the intermediate and ventral parts of the spinal gray matter is relatively small. This leaves in question the importance of the contribution of the PPC to the initiation and modulation of voluntary movements in the cat. As this anatomical evidence is not entirely compatible with the physiological data, we reinvestigated the PPC projection to the motor cortex by injecting dextran amine tracers either into the proximal or distal representations of the forelimb in the rostral motor cortex, into the representation of the forelimb in the caudal motor cortex, or into the hindlimb representation. The results show strong projections from the PPC to each of these regions. However, projections to the rostral motor cortex were observed primarily from the caudal bank of the ansate sulcus and the adjacent gyrus, whereas those to the caudal motor cortex were generally located more rostrally. There was also evidence of some topographic organization with the distal limb being located progressively more laterally and rostrally in the PPC than the areas projecting to more proximal regions. In contrast to previous anatomical investigations, these results suggest that the PPC can potentially modulate motor activity via its strong projection to the more rostral regions of the motor cortex.

Both central and peripheral dopamine pathways may influence ulcer pathogenesis. Dopamine agonists prevent whereas antagonists augment stress- and chemically induced gastrointestinal ulcers in preclinical models. The dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,36-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) depletes central dopamine and induces lesions in the substantia nigra, and, if given in high doses, MPTP induces a Parkinson disease-like syndrome and gastric ulcers. Because schizophrenia is attributed, in part, to an overactive dopaminergic system, persons with schizophrenia may display a reduced susceptibility toward gastrointestinal ulcers. A case-control study was conducted in patients represented in the 2002 National Inpatient Sample, the largest all-payer inpatient care database in the United States, consisting of 5 to 8 million inpatient hospital stays per year, which approximates a 20% sample of community hospitals. A significant association was observed between schizophrenia and diminished risk for duodenal (odds ratio [OR] 0.55; 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.45-0.67) and gastric (OR 0.54; 95% Cl 0.46-0.63) (p <.01) ulcers but not for gastrojejunal ulcers (OR 0.44; 95% Cl 0.16-1.20) (p =.11). Potential confounders such as age, gender, race, tobacco or alcohol dependence, and Helicobacter pylori infection were controlled in multivariate analyses. This observational study in a large sample of patients in community hospitals suggests that schizophrenia and attendant neurobiologic mechanisms (eg, variability in dopamine pathways) may act in concert to modify the composite risk for gastrointestinal ulcers. Dopamine pathways warrant further prospective research as new potential drug targets in ulcer disease.

The metastatic process involves the invasion of tumor cells into the adjacent tissue, followed by systemic dissemination and colonization of secondary organs. These processes require interactions between tumor cells and a changing microenvironment, which drive cell proliferation, migration, invasion and colonization, as well as promoting cell survival. The integrin family of cell adhesion receptors as been shown to play a critical role in all of these processes, consistent with their extracellular matrix binding properties. Experiments in cultured epithelial cells and in vivo models have demonstrated that integrins can promote various stages of metastasis by modulating the effects of growth factor receptors, extracellular proteases and chemotactic molecules. Integrins may therefore play a pivotal role in multiple mechanisms of metastasis. As a result, they represent promising targets for effective treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Oxysterols and other cholesterol oxidation products are effective ligands of liver X activated receptor (LXR) nuclear receptors, major regulators of genes subserving cholesterol homeostasis. LXR receptors act as molecular sensors of cellular cholesterol concentrations and effectors of tissue cholesterol reduction. Following their interaction with oxysterols, activation of LXRs induces the expression of ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A member 1, a pivotal modulator of cholesterol efflux. The relative solubility of oxysterols facilitates lipid flux among brain compartments and egress across the blood-brain barrier. Oxysterol-mediated LXR activation induces local apoE biosynthesis (predominantly in astrocytes) further enhancing cholesterol re-distribution and removal. Activated LXRs invoke additional neuroprotective mechanisms, including induction of genes governing bile acid synthesis (sterol elimination pathway), apolipoprotein elaboration, and amyloid precursor protein processing. The latter translates into attenuated beta-amyloid production that may ameliorate amyloidogenic neurotoxicity in AD brain. Stress-induced up-regulation of the heme-degrading enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 in AD-affected astroglia may impact central lipid homeostasis by promoting the oxidation of cholesterol to a host of oxysterol intermediates. Synthetic oxysterol-mimetic drugs that activate LXR receptors within the CNS may provide novel therapeutics for management of AD and other neurological afflictions characterized by deranged tissue cholesterol homeostasis.

Scopolamine is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist that induces memory deficits in young subjects similar to those occurring during aging. The amnesic effect of scopolamine is well established but the molecular and cellular mechanisms that sustain its neuropharmacological action are still unclear. The present genome wide study investigates hippocampal gene expression profiling in scopolamine-treated adult rats following stimulation in a spatial memory task. Using microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR approaches, we identified several genes previously known to be associated with memory processes (Homer1, GABA(B) receptor, early growth response 1, prodynorphin, VGF nerve growth factor inducible) and multiple novel candidate genes possibly involved in cognition (including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, dual specificity phosphatase 5 and 6, glycophorin C) that were altered following scopolamine treatment. Moreover, we found that stable over-expression of glutamatergic components Homer1a and 1c in the hippocampus of adult rats induced by recombinant adeno-associated virus vector abolished memory improvement produced by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist SGS742 in scopolamine-treated rats. Taken together, these results reveal novel genes and mechanisms involved in scopolamine-induced amnesia, and demonstrate the involvement of both GABA and glutamate neurotransmission in this animal model of cognitive dysfunctions.

Afferent input, efference copy, signal noise, and biases in perception of joint angle during active versus passive elbow movements	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							MUSCLE-SPINDLE AFFERENTS; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; 2-DIMENSIONAL LIMB MOVEMENTS; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL TRACT NEURONS; POSITION SENSE; REACHING MOVEMENTS; HUMAN FOREARM; MOTOR CORTEX; SENSORIMOTOR CONTROL	Psychophysical studies have reported an overestimation of limb position in the direction of movement during the early part of active movements. The main hypothesis tested in this study is that the overestimation results from a process of forward prediction of limb state driven by an efference copy of the outgoing motor command. This hypothesis predicts that position overestimation should decrease or disappear during passive movements, for which there should be no efference copy. Seven subjects were asked to remember and to report the perceived angle of their elbow joint at different times during active and passive movements. They showed a highly velocity-dependent overestimation of the elbow joint angle near the beginning of the movement in both active and passive trials. Toward the end of the movement, subjects showed a relatively velocity-independent underestimation of their elbow angle in all trials. Contrary to the prediction of the efference copy hypothesis, the amplitude and the velocity-dependent slope of the elbow angle overestimation were both greater during the early part of passive movements than active movements. This indicates that psychophysical evidence of early overestimation of arm position on its own is not a sufficient proof of forward prediction based on an efference copy, at least under the conditions of this study. Decreased errors during active movements suggest that an efference copy can improve the accuracy of state estimation during active movements. Error patterns seem to parallel the likely level of sensorimotor noise, suggesting a probabilistic mechanism for position estimation.

The electrosensory system of weakly electric fish recognizes different environmental stimuli by their unique alteration of a self-generated electric field. Variations in the patterns of stimuli are primarily distinguished based on their frequency. Pyramidal neurons in the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) are often tuned to respond to specific input frequencies. Alterations in the tuning of the pyramidal neurons may allow weakly electric fish to preferentially select for certain stimuli. Here we show that muscarinic receptor activation in vivo enhances the excitability, burst firing, and subsequently the response of pyramidal cells to naturalistic sensory input. Through a combination of in vitro electrophysiology and mathematical modeling, we reveal that this enhanced excitability and bursting likely results from the down-regulation of an A-type potassium current. Further, we provide an explanation of the mechanism by which these currents can mediate frequency tuning.

Activity of vestibular nuclei neurons during vestibular and optokinetic stimulation in the alert mouse	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; INTRINSIC MEMBRANE-PROPERTIES; PASSIVE HEAD MOVEMENTS; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES; RESPONSE EYE-MOVEMENTS; GUINEA-PIG; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; MUTANT MICE; IN-VITRO	As a result of the availability of genetic mutant strains and development of noninvasive eye movements recording techniques, the mouse stands as a very interesting model for bridging the gap among behavioral responses, neuronal response dynamics studied in vivo, and cellular mechanisms investigated in vitro. Here we characterized the responses of individual neurons in the mouse vestibular nuclei during vestibular (horizontal whole body rotations) and full field visual stimulation. The majority of neurons (similar to 2/3) were sensitive to vestibular stimulation but not to eye movements. During the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR), these neurons discharged in a manner comparable to the "vestibular only" (VO) neurons that have been previously described in primates. The remaining neurons [eye-movement-sensitive (ES) neurons] encoded both head-velocity and eye-position information during the VOR. When vestibular and visual stimulation were applied so that there was sensory conflict, the behavioral gain of the VOR was reduced. In turn, the modulation of sensitivity of VO neurons remained unaffected, whereas that of ES neurons was reduced. ES neurons were also modulated in response to full field visual stimulation that evoked the optokinetic reflex (OKR). Mouse VO neurons, however, unlike their primate counterpart, were not modulated during OKR. Taken together, our results show that the integration of visual and vestibular information in the mouse vestibular nucleus is limited to a subpopulation of neurons which likely supports gaze stabilization for both VOR and OKR.

Diffusion tensor imaging analysis of long association bundles in the presence of an arteriovenous malformation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						arteriovenous malformation; associative area; brain white matter; diffusion tensor imaging; fiber tract; tractography	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE TRACTOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; FIBER TRACKING; CORTICOSPINAL TRACT; AXONAL TRACKING; IN-VIVO; SURGERY; TUMOR; DISSECTION	Object. Conventional imaging demonstrates intertwined fibers of the cerebral white matter as a homogeneous substrate. Recently, diffusion tensor imaging has allowed 3D reconstruction of these fiber bundles. The goal of this study was to analyze the modifications of the association fibers induced by an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the parietotemporooccipital (PTO) associative area and their clinical significance. Methods. The authors analyzed the long association fibers in seven patients harboring an AVM in or near the PTO region in relation with the fibers' clinical manifestation. The fibers include the arcuate fasciculus (AF), the occipitofrontal fasciculus (OFF), and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). These structures were compared with the contralateral bundles. Results. The modification of the tracts could establish a pattern signature depending on the specific location of the vascular malformation. There was a positive correlation between the degree of modifications of OFF and ILF fiber tracts and visual deficits. Alteration of the AF correlated with a speech disorder and the risk of postoperative deficits. Conclusions. Diffusion tensor imaging enables in vivo dissection of fiber tracts coursing through the PTO area. Depending on the location of the AVMs, long association fibers are variously modified. These findings correlate with clinical manifestations and may predict outcome after surgery.

Given that the evidence for the link between lipid metabolism and psychopathology thus far has almost exclusively hinged on alterations of these variables in blood, this study aimed to address whether similar alterations in fatty acids would be evident in the brains of people who complete suicide. Methods: Using gas chromatography, we measured 49 different fatty acids in the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral prefrontal cortex of people who had completed suicide with ( n = 16) and without ( n= 23) major depression and in control subjects ( n= 19) with no current psychopathology and whose cause of death was sudden. Results: Comparisons of fatty acids between the 3 groups did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion: Further research is required to better understand the link between fatty acids in the peripheral circulation and those in the central nervous system before determining whether fatty acids play a mediating role in suicidal behaviour.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: A random sample of 200 subjects with myotonic dystrophy (42 mild phenotypes, 158 adult phenotypes). Measurement: The Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H), a questionnaire assessing self-perceived life habits (activities and participation as described in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)). Results: Participants with the adult phenotype demonstrated significantly lower participation levels than those with the mild phenotype on 8 out of the 11 categories of the LIFE-H. Lower levels of accomplishment were reported in Mobility, Housing, Fitness; Nutrition, Personal Care, Employment, Recreation, and Community Life categories among the adult phenotype. The Recreation category was the most affected, with 4 out of 7 items revealing compromised accomplishment among 22-27% of individuals. The lowest satisfaction score was observed in the Employment and Recreation categories. In all categories, individuals with the adult phenotype displayed significantly lower satisfaction levels than those with the mild phenotype. Conclusion: This study helped to establish a clearer distinction between activities and participation levels of individuals with the mild phenotype and those with the adult phenotype and supported tailored rehabilitation and community services to improve accomplishment of life habits.

Detecting sparse signals in random fields, with an application to brain mapping	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						brain mapping; Euler characteristic; multiple comparisons; random fields	CORTICAL THICKNESS ANALYSIS; EXCURSION SETS; EULER CHARACTERISTICS; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; TUBE FORMULAS; LOCAL MAXIMA; FMRI DATA; ACTIVATION; INEQUALITIES; IDENTITIES	Brain mapping data have been modeled as Gaussian random fields, and local increases in mean are detected by local maxima of a random field of test statistics derived from these data. Accurate p values for local maxima are readily available for isotropic data based on the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set of the test statistic random field. In this article we give a simple method for dealing with nonisotropic data. Our approach has connections to the model of Sampson and Guttorp for nonisotropy in which there exists an unknown mapping of the support of the data to a space in which the random fields are isotropic. Heuristic justification for our approach comes from the Nash embedding theorem. Formally, we show that our method gives consistent unbiased estimators for the true p values based on new results of Taylor and Adler for random fields on manifolds, which replace the Euclidean metric by the variogram. The results are used to detect gender differences in the cortical thickness of the brain and to detect regions of the brain involved in sentence comprehension measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.

The neuropsychological assessment protocol for children aged 6 to 18 years is described and normative data are presented for participants in that age range (N = 385). For many measures. raw score performance improved steeply from 6 to 10 years, decelerating during adolescence. Sex differences were documented for Block Design (male advantage), CVLT, Pegboard and Coding (female advantage). Household income predicted IQ and achievement, as well as externalizing problems and social competence, but not the other cognitive or behavioral measures. Performance of this healthy sample was,generally better than published norms. This linked imaging-clinical/behavioral database will be an invaluable public resource for researchers for many years to come.

We report on two cases of BCS lesions examined by MRS; the first case was evaluated 36 days after the onset of symptoms, whereas the second case was evaluated 9 days after the onset of symptoms. MRS data were obtained from single voxels located in the lesion and in the contralateral region. Relative to the creatine/phosphocreatine peak, BCS lesions displayed decreases of N-acetyl aspartate and increases of choline, myo-inositol (mI), glutamine/glutamate (Glx), lactate and lipid+macromolecule signals, in agreement with previous reports. In addition, previously unreported decreases of mI (-19% to -29%) and increases of Glx (+55% to +198%) were measured; these could be useful in characterizing BCS lesions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The richness and subtlety of inhibition are achieved by diverse classes of interneurons that are endowed with distinct physiological properties. In addition, the axons of interneurons display highly characteristic and class-specific geometry and innervation patterns, and thereby distribute their output to discrete spatial domains, cell types and subcellular compartments in neural networks. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that specify and modify inhibitory innervation patterns are only just beginning to be understood.

Based on the complete obliteration of most of the cranial sutures, the specimen is identified as an adult individual of Conchoraptor gracilis Barsbold 1986. Except for the orbitosphenoids and epipterygoids, the preserved bones of the neurocranium are hollow. Three types of tympanic recess are present in Conchoraptor, a characteristic shared with troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and avian theropods. The contralateral middle ear cavities are interconnected by the supraencephalic pathway that passes through the dorsal tympanic recesses, the posterodorsal prootic sinuses and the parietal sinus. The spatial arrangements of the middle ear cavity and a derived neurocranial pneumatic system in Conchoraptor indicate enhancements of acoustic perception in the lower-frequency registers and of auditory directionality. We further speculate that this improvement of binaural hearing could be explained as an adaptation required for accurate detection of prey and/or predators under conditions of low illumination. The other potentially pneumatic structures of the Conchoraptor cranium include (1) recessus-like irregularities on the dorsal surface of the nasal and frontal bones (a putative oviraptorid synapomorphy; pos); (2) a subotic recess; (3) a sub-condylar recess; and (4) a posterior condylar recess (pos).

From a face to its category via a few information processing states in the brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL CATEGORIZATION; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION; RESPONSES; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; MEMORY	Cognitive neuroscience assumes a correspondence between specific spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity and the states of a mechanism that processes cognitive information. Mechanistic explanations of cognition should therefore translate patterns of neural activity into the components of a formal mechanism: a set of information processing states and their transitions. For the first time, we carried out this research programme with four naive observers instructed to categorise randomly presented face information. With classification image techniques, we revealed the diagnostic features that the brain requires to produce correct behaviour (i.e., two eyes for gender categorisation in one session; the mouth for expression in the other session). With the same techniques applied to brain signals, we revealed the features processing states associated with modulations of oscillatory EEG energy (measured on occipito-temporal face-sensitive electrodes). Here we show how transitions between distinct feature processing states in the theta/alpha 14-12 Hzj oscillatory bands implement two face categorisations. On the left and right occipito-temporal electrodes of each observer, processing of the contra-lateral eye precedes bilateral integration of the features required for behaviour. For the first time, we relate stimulus information to behaviour via sequences of categorisation-specific feature processing states in the brain. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent studies provide evidence that P2X ATP receptors on the surface of microglia play a crucial role in initiation of inflammatory cascades. We investigated changes in surface P2X receptors in BV-2 murine microglial cells following their activation by pro-inflammatory bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). mRNA analysis using RT-PCR confirmed the presence of P2X4 and P2X7 as the main P2X subunits. Application of ATP at low (<= 100 mu M) and high (>= 1 mM) concentrations, as well as BzATP, activated inward currents in BV-2 cells. Current responses of P2X4 and P2X7 subtypes could be distinguished based on their respective sensitivity to the positive modulator ivermectin and to the antagonist Brilliant Blue G. Treatment of BV-2 cells with LPS leads to a transient increase in ivermectin-sensitive P2X4 currents, while dominant P2X7 currents remain largely unaffected. This increase in P2X4 function was concomitant with higher receptor protein expression, itself related to an upregulation of P2X4 mRNA levels that peaked at 48 h post-LPS treatment. Our data demonstrate that although LPS activation has a minor impact on P2X7 receptors that remain the major ionotropic ATP receptors in microglia, it specifically enhances responses to low ATP concentrations mediated by P2X4 receptors, highlighting the significant contribution of both subtypes to neuroinflammatory mechanisms and pathologies.

Improvement of arm movement patterns and endpoint control depends on type of feedback during practice in stroke survivors	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						stroke; arm paresis; motor recovery; compensation; knowledge of results; knowledge of performance	UNILATERAL BRAIN-DAMAGE; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; EXPLICIT INFORMATION; GUIDANCE HYPOTHESIS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; TRUNK RESTRAINT; MOTOR RECOVERY; KNOWLEDGE; REHABILITATION; TASK	Background. A major challenge in stroke rehabilitation is restoration of arm motor function. Therapy-induced improvements in arm function may occur via restoration of premorbid movement patterns (recovery) or development of compensatory movement strategies. However, it is unclear whether the learning benefits of practice might be enhanced by incorporating different forms of feedback, focusing on movement outcomes or on specific arm movement patterns. Objective. To determine if manipulation of attentional focus by providing either knowledge of results (KR) feedback, focusing on movement outcomes, or knowledge of performance (KP) feedback, focusing on arm movement patterns during repetitive practice of a pointing movement, may lead to arm motor recovery. Methods. Twenty-eight chronic stroke survivors were randomly assigned to 2 groups that practiced 10 sessions of 75 pointing movements. During practice, groups received either 20% KR about movement precision or faded (26.6% average) KP about arm joint movements. A nondisabled control group (n = 5) practiced the same task with KR. Results. Motor patterns recovered only in KP, as evidenced by immediate and long-term increases in joint range, better interjoint coordination in early movement phases, and generalization of gains. Improvements in clinical impairment and function were related to decreases in compensation (trunk rotation) and recovery of interjoint coordination in mid-movement phases. Conclusions. In stroke survivors, when the learners' attention was directed to the movements themselves (KP), motor improvements reflect recovery compared to when attention was directed toward movement outcomes (KR).

This paper describes a simple, one-step method for the production of OT in its reduced, dithiol form (OT dithiol), free of reducing agent. The effects of temperature, pH, and metal-ion chelators on the autoxidation of OT dithiol were examined to establish if this form is likely to persist under biological conditions. It was found that OT dithiol has a half-life of 1.8 h with respect to reformation of OT disulfide at 37 degrees C and pH 6.9 in the presence of the copper chelators, DTPA and neocuproine. S-Nitrosation of OT dithiol by acidified nitrite at pH 3.0 was examined by absorption spectroscopy and HPLC-UV-MS, which revealed that both singly and doubly S-nitrosated OT are formed. These results suggest novel chemical aspects to OT signaling, the biological implications of which are discussed here. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Etiologic profile of spastic quadriplegia in children	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TETRAPLEGIC CEREBRAL-PALSY; CHANGING PANORAMA; PREVALENCE; SWEDEN; ORIGIN; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SERIES; TERM; MR	The etiologic profile and possible predictors of etiology in children with spastic quadriplegia were assessed in a consecutive cohort of children with this motor impairment. Medical records from a single pediatric neurology practice over a 14-year interval were retrospectively and systematically reviewed. Variables comprised possible demographic, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors. Of the 99 patients included in the study, 39 were premature (< 37 weeks gestation). The overall etiologic yield was 83%. The top three diagnoses were hypoxicischemic perinatal asphyxia (33%), periventricular leukomalacia (15%), and central nervous system infections (11%). In premature children, the most common diagnoses were periventricular leukomalacia (33%), perinatal asphyxia (26%), and central nervous system infections (15%). In term-born children, the most frequent diagnoses were perinatal asphyxia (37%), metabolic disease (12%), and structural malformation or infection (9% each). Factors predicting the identification of an etiology included male sex (P = 0.05), low birth weight (P = 0.003), prematurity (P = 0.01), perinatal complications (P = 0.002), and neonatal encephalopathy (P = 0.006). The etiologic yield in patients with spastic quadriplegia was 83%, with differing underlying etiologies depending on gestational age. These results should help guide physicians in investigating possible underlying etiologies in patients with spastic quadriplegia. (C) 2007 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Does cerebellar injury in premature infants contribute to the high prevalence of long-term cognitive, learning, and behavioral disability in survivors?	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						cerebellar injury; prematurity; MRI; developmental; outcome	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; EXTREMELY PRETERM BIRTH; WHITE-MATTER INJURY; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITY; CEREBRAL-PALSY; RISK-FACTORS; AUTISM; CHILDREN	OBJECTIVE. Although cerebellar hemorrhagic injury is increasingly diagnosed in infants who survive premature birth, its long-term neurodevelopmental impact is poorly defined. We sought to delineate the potential role of cerebellar hemorrhagic injury in the long-term disabilities of survivors of prematurity. DESIGN. We compared neurodevelopmental outcome in 3 groups of premature infants ( N = 86; 35 isolated cerebellar hemorrhagic injury, 35 age-matched controls, 16 cerebellar hemorrhagic injury plus supratentorial parenchymal injury). Subjects underwent formal neurologic examinations and a battery of standardized developmental, functional, and behavioral evaluations ( mean age: 32.1 +/- 11.1 months). Autism-screening questionnaires were completed. RESULTS. Neurologic abnormalities were present in 66% of the isolated cerebellar hemorrhagic injury cases compared with 5% of the infants in the control group. Infants with isolated cerebellar hemorrhagic injury versus controls had significantly lower mean scores on all tested measures, including severe motor disabilities ( 48% vs 0%), expressive language ( 42% vs 0%), delayed receptive language ( 37% vs 0%), and cognitive deficits ( 40% vs 0%). Isolated cerebellar hemorrhagic injury was significantly associated with severe functional limitations in day-to-day activities. Significant differences were noted between cases of cerebellar hemorrhagic injury versus controls on autism screeners ( 37% vs 0%) and internalizing behavioral problems ( 34% vs 9%). Global developmental, functional, and social-behavioral deficits were more common and profound in preterm infants with injury to the vermis. Preterm infants with cerebellar hemorrhagic injury and supratentorial parenchymal injury were not at overall greater risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities, although neuromotor impairment was more severe. CONCLUSIONS. Cerebellar hemorrhagic injury in preterm infants is associated with a high prevalence of long-term pervasive neurodevelopment disabilities and may play an important and underrecognized role in the cognitive, learning, and behavioral dysfunction known to affect survivors.

In order to characterize novel TSH secretagogues, we have investigated the effect of frog (Rana ridibunda) vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) (fVIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) (fPACAP38 and PACAP27) on TSH release from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) pituitary cells in primary culture. Incubation of pituitary cells for 24 h with graded concentrations of fVIP, fPACAP38 and PACAP27 (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) induced a dose-dependent stimulation of TSH release with minimum effective doses of 10-9 M for fVIP and 10(-8) M for fPACAP38 and PACAP27. The PAC1-R/VPAC2-R antagonist PACAP(6-38) (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) dose-dependently suppressed the stimulatory effects of fVIP and fPACAP38 (10-7 M each). Likewise, this antagonist (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) dose-dependently attenuated the stimulatory effect of PACAP27 (10-7 M). On the other hand, the VPAC1-R/VPAC2-R antagonist [D-pCl-Phe(6), Leu(17)]-VIP (10(-6) and 10(-5) M) dose-dependently inhibited the stimulatory effect of fVIP (10(-9) M) and PACAP27 (10(-8) M), but did not affect the response to fPACAP38 (10(-8) M). These data indicate that, in amphibians, the activity of thyrotrophs can be regulated by VIP and PACAP acting likely through VPAC2-R and PAC1-R. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Education modulates cortisol reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test in middle-aged adults	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						education; stress-reactivity; Trier Social Stress Test	HPA AXIS RESPONSES; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; MEN; ERGOMETRY; HUMANS; YOUNG; WOMEN	The present study assessed the modulating effect of education level on cortisol reactivity to the Trier Social, Stress Test (TSST) in a sample of 101 middle-aged adults (22 mates, 79 females) between the ages of 50 and 65. The TSST involves a public speech and mental arithmetic task in front of an audience. No previous studies have assessed whether education level can have an impact on cortisol. reactivity to this psychosocial stressor. It is plausible that greater exposure to academia may impact how one perceives and responds to the demands of the speech and arithmetic task. Should education have an impact on cortisol reactivity to the TSST, future studies will. be required to control for this factor in order to reduce both statistical error and false interpretations. In addition to completing the TSST, participants were administered a battery of neurocognitive tests and personality questionnaires, including a report on education level (i.e. number of years total and degree: High School, Junior College, Technical, University). Results showed that adults with post-secondary education above Junior College tended to secrete higher cortisol levels overall, as measured by total. area under the curve. However, it was the group with lower educational attainment who showed a greater stress response specific to the TSST, as measured by percentage increase in cortisol from pre- to post-TSST. Analyses also found that higher educated adults performed better than their Less educated peers on verbal fluency. Considering that the TSST is an oral task, it is suggested that middle-aged individuals with a tower level of education may find the TSST more stressful due to lower verbal capacity, which may lead to an increased cortisol. response to the TSST when compared to individuals with a higher level of education.

Numerous studies have shown that individuals with schizophrenia are largely impaired on this domain of cognition. However, most have focused on a single aspect of social cognition, namely "theory of mind" and/or included patients with long standing illness. Objective: The main objective of the present study was to identify social cognition deficits in first episode of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis using a case control design and a comprehensive assessment that allowed the exploration of several dimensions of this phenomenon. Subjects: 36 patients with a first episode of psychosis and 25 healthy controls participated in this study. Material: Measures of social cognition included the Hinting Task and the Four Factor Test of Social Intelligence. Results: Significant group differences were found on both tasks, but the Four Factor Test of Social Intelligence revealed a stronger group effect and the effects observed remained significant once IQ was covaried. Social cognition did not show any correlations with level of symptoms. Conclusion: Social cognition deficits are present during the first episode of psychosis. These impairments do not seem to be a consequence of group differences in overall intellectual ftinctioning and are likely to be state-independent. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI), inattention, and daytime sleepiness scores were measured by questionnaire at 6 years of age in a sample of births from 1997 to 1998 in a Canadian province (N=1492). The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised (PPVT-R) was administered at 5 years of age and the Block Design subtest (WISC-III) was administered at 6 years of age. Sleep duration was reported yearly by the children's mothers from age 2.5 to 6 years. A group-based semi-parametric mixture model was used to estimate developmental patterns of sleep duration. The relationships between sleep duration patterns and both behavioral items and neurodevelopmental tasks were tested using weighted multivariate logistic regression models to control for potentially confounding psychosocial factors. Results: Four sleep duration patterns were identified: short persistent (6.0%), short increasing (4.8%),10-hour persistent (50.3%), and 11-hour persistent (38.9%). The association of short sleep duration patterns with high HI scores (P=0.001), low PPVT-R performance (P=0.002), and low Block Design subtest performance (P=0.004) remained significant after adjusting for potentially confounding variables. Conclusions: Shortened sleep duration, especially before the age of 41 months, is associated with externalizing problems such as HI and lower cognitive performance on neurodevelopmental tests. Results highlight the importance of giving a child the opportunity to sleep at least 10 hours per night throughout early childhood.

Although vital for many neural computations, the cellular basis of such frequency tuning remains mostly unknown. In the electrosensory system of Apteronotus leptorhynchus, the primary processing of important environmental and communication signals occurs in pyramidal neurons of the electrosensory lateral line lobe. Spike trains transmitted by these cells can encode low-frequency prey stimuli with bursts of spikes and high-frequency communication signals with single spikes. Here, we demonstrate that the selective expression of SK2 channels in a subset of pyramidal neurons reduces their response to low-frequency stimuli by opposing their burst responses. Apamin block of the SK2 current in this subset of cells induced bursting and increased their response to low-frequency inputs. SK channel expression thus provides an intrinsic mechanism that predisposes a neuron to respond to higher frequencies and thus specific, behaviorally relevant stimuli.

Genetic inhibition of cardiac ERK1/2 promotes stress-induced apoptosis and heart failure but has no effect on hypertrophy in vivo	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						cardiomyopathy; MAPK; signaling	SIGNAL-REGULATED KINASE; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASES; RAF-1 KINASE; MYOCYTE HYPERTROPHY; CELL HYPERTROPHY; ERK2; PATHWAY; PHOSPHATASE-3; PHENYLEPHRINE; ORGANIZATION	MAPK signaling pathways function as critical regulators of cellular differentiation, proliferation, stress responsiveness, and apoptosis. One branch of the MAPK signaling pathway that culminates in ERK1/2 activation is hypothesized to regulate the growth and adaptation of the heart to both physiologic and pathologic stimuli, given its known activation in response to virtually every stress- and agonist-induced hypertrophic stimulus examined to date. Here we investigated the requirement of ERK1/2 signaling in mediating the cardiac hypertrophic growth response in Erk1(-/-) and Erk(2+/-) mice, as well as in transgenic mice with inducible expression of an ERK1/2-inactivating phosphatase in the heart, dual-specificity phosphatase 6. Although inducible expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 6 in the heart eliminated ERK1/2 phosphorylation at baseline and after stimulation without affecting any other MAPK, it did not diminish the hypertrophic response to pressure overload stimulation, neuroendocrine agonist infusion, or exercise. Similarly, Erk1(-/-) and Erk(2+/-) mice showed no reduction in pathologic or physiologic stimulus-induced cardiac growth in vivo. However, blockade or deletion of cardiac ERK1/2 did predispose the heart to decompensation and failure after long-term pressure overload in conjunction with an increase in myocyte TUNEL. Thus, ERK1/2 signaling is not required for mediating physiologic or pathologic cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, although it does play a protective role in response to pathologic stimuli.

Herein we report that 22R-hydroxycholesterol inhibits the proliferation of human Ntera2/D1 teratocarcinoma precursor cells (NT2) and induces these cells to differentiate into "neuron-like" or "astrocyte-like" cells. 22R-Hydroxycholesterol-induced differentiation of NT2 cells is associated with increases in the expression of neurofilament protein NF200, the cytoskeletal proteins microtubule-associated protein type 11 (MAP2) a and MAP2b, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor-alpha 2 (GFR alpha 2). These effects of 22R-hydroxycholesterol are considered to be stereospecific because its enantiomer 22S-hydroxycholesterol and other steroids failed to induce differentiation of NT2 cells. 22R-Hydroxycholesterol was found to lack specific binding for numerous receptors, including all steroid receptors tested. However, using a cholesterol protein binding blot assay we demonstrated the presence of a 22R-hydroxycholesterol-binding protein in NT2 cells distinct from the human oxysterol receptors liver X receptor LXR alpha and beta.

Although astrocytes are known to control BBB permeability, the molecular determinants of this effect remain unknown. We show that angiotensinogen (AGT) produced and secreted by astrocytes is cleaved into angiotensin II (AngII) and acts on type 1 angiotensin receptors (AT(1)) expressed by BBB endothelial cells (ECs). Activation of AT(1) restricts the passage of molecular tracers across human BBB-derived ECs through threonine-phosphorylation of the tight junction protein occludin and its mobilization to lipid raft membrane microdomains. We also show that AGT knock-out animals have disorganized occludin strands at the level of the BBB and a diffuse accumulation of the endogenous serum protein plasminogen in the CNS, compared with wild-type animals. Finally, we demonstrate a reduction in the number of AGT-immunopositive perivascular astrocytes in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, which correlates with a reduced expression of occludin similarly seen in the CNS of AGT knock-out animals. Such a reduction in astrocyte-expressed AGT and AngII is dependent, in vitro, on the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma. Our study defines a novel physiological role for AngII in the CNS and suggests that inflammation-induced downregulation of AngII production by astrocytes is involved in BBB dysfunction in MS lesions.

In the olfactory system, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) project axons to spatially defined glomeruli within the olfactory bulb ( OB). A spatial relationship exists between the location of OSNs within the olfactory epithelium (OE) and their glomerular targets along the dorsoventral axis in the OB. The molecular mechanisms underlying the zonal segregation of OSN axons along the dorsoventral axis of the OB are poorly understood. Using robo-2(-/-) ( roundabout) and slit-1(-/-) mice, we examined the role of the Slit family of axon guidance cues in the targeting of OSN axons during development. We show that a subset of OSN axons that normally project to the dorsal region of the OB mistarget and form glomeruli in the ventral region in robo-2(-/-) and slit-1(-/-) mice. In addition, we show that the Slit receptor, Robo-2, is expressed in OSNs in a high dorsomedial to low ventrolateral gradient across the OE and that Slit-1 and Slit-3 are expressed in the ventral region of the OB. These results indicate that the dorsal-to-ventral segregation of OSN axons are not solely defined by the location of OSNs within the OE but also relies on axon guidance cues.

Validation of PET-SORTEO Monte Carlo simulations for the geometries of the MicroPET r4 and Focus 220 PET scanners	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; MODEL	PET-SORTEO is aMonteCarlo- based simulator that enables the fast generation of realistic PET data for the geometry of the ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner. In order to address the increasing need for simulation models of animal PET imaging systems, our aim is to adapt and configure this simulation tool for small animal PET scanners, especially for the widely distributed microPET R4 and Focus 220 systems manufactured by Siemens Preclinical Solutions. We propose a simulation model that can produce realistic rodent images in order to evaluate and optimize acquisition and reconstruction protocols. The first part of this study presents the validation of SORTEO against the geometries of the R4 and the Focus 220 systems. This validation is carried out against actual measurements performed on the R4 scanner at the Montreal Neurological Institute in Canada and on the Focus 220 system of the department of radiopharmaceuticals of the Austrian Research Center in Seibersdorf. The comparison of simulated and experimental performance measurements includes spatial resolution, energy spectra, scatter fraction and count rates. In the second part of the study, we demonstrate the ability to rapidly generate realistic whole-body radioactive distributions using the MOBY phantom and give comparative example case studies of the same rodent model simulated with PET-SORTEO for the R4 and Focus 220 systems.

The prefrontal cortical areas, however, involved in the capacity of the human brain to encode and hold "in mind" the precise order of occurrence of a limited number of visual stimuli after a single exposure are not known. Changes in regional cerebral activity were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects were coding the precise order of a short sequence of abstract visual stimuli. T e results demonstrate the involvement of areas 46 and 9/46, within the mid-dorsolateral subdivision of the prefrontal cortex, in the coding of the precise order of a short sequence of visual stimuli in working memory, consistent with earlier results from monkey lesion studies. The availability of such detailed serial-order information in working memory allows high-level cognitive planning and mental manipulation, functions that depend on prefrontal cortex.

Diagnosis delays in childhood cancer - A review	CANCER			English	Review						children; cancer; diagnosis; delay; prognosis; epidemiology	PEDIATRIC BRAIN-TUMORS; SYMPTOM INTERVAL; BREAST-CANCER; RETINOBLASTOMA; CHILDREN; SURVIVAL; TIME; PROGNOSIS; STAGE; MEDULLOBLASTOMA	Timely access to quality healthcare has become an increasingly important public health concern over the years. Early diagnosis of cancer is a fundamental goal in oncology because it allows an opportunity for timely treatment while disease burden is still in its earliest stages. Consequently, prognosis may improve, and a cure can be attained with minimal side or late effects. This review examined delays present in diagnosis of childhood cancers and factors that influence these delays. An extensive search of the literature published before April 15, 2007 was conducted for studies that evaluated any type of delay along the cancer-care continuum. Twenty-three studies were included. Diagnosis delay varied across studies. Physician delays were generally longer than those consequent to parents' or patients' recognition of underlying disease. Causes of delays can be grouped into 3 categories: patient and/or parent, disease, and healthcare. The main factors related to diagnosis delay were the child's age at diagnosis, parent level of education, type of cancer, presentation of symptoms, tumor site, cancer stage, and first medical specialty consulted. Greater understanding of factors that influence delays and the individual impact of patient and provider delays on disease severity and prognosis would be useful to form effective policies and programs aimed at ensuring timely access to healthcare for children with cancer.

Here, we delineate the role of autocrine production of fibroblast growth factor 4 (Fgf4) and associated activation of the Erk1/2 (Mapk3/1) signalling cascade. Fgf4 is the major stimulus activating Erk in mouse ES cells. Interference with FGF or Erk activity using chemical inhibitors or genetic ablations does not impede propagation of undifferentiated ES cells. Instead, such manipulations restrict the ability of ES cells to commit to differentiation. ES cells lacking Fgf4 or treated with FGF receptor inhibitors resist neural and mesodermal induction, and are refractory to BMP-induced non-neural differentiation. Lineage commitment potential of Fgf4-null cells is restored by provision of FGF protein. Thus, FGF enables rather than antagonises the differentiation activity of BMP. The key downstream role of Erk signalling is revealed by examination of Erk2-null ES cells, which fail to undergo either neural or mesodermal differentiation in adherent culture, and retain expression of pluripotency markers Oct4, Nanog and Rex1. These findings establish that Fgf4 stimulation of Erk1/2 is an autoinductive stimulus for naive ES cells to exit the self-renewal programme. We propose that the Erk cascade directs transition to a state that is responsive to inductive cues for germ layer segregation. Consideration of Erk signalling as a primary trigger that potentiates lineage commitment provides a context for reconciling disparate views on the contribution of FGF and BMP pathways during germ layer specification in vertebrate embryos.

Myofibre damage in human skeletal muscle: effects of electrical stimulation versus voluntary contraction	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							TENASCIN-C; ECCENTRIC CONTRACTIONS; SATELLITE CELLS; SINGLE BOUT; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; GROWTH-FACTORS; SELF-RENEWAL; EXERCISE; ADAPTATION	Disruption to proteins within the myofibre after a single bout of unaccustomed eccentric exercise is hypothesized to induce delayed onset of muscle soreness and to be associated with an activation of satellite cells. This has been shown in animal models using electrical stimulation but not in humans using voluntary exercise. Untrained males (n = 8, range 22-27 years) performed 2 10 maximal eccentric contractions with each leg on an isokinetic dynamometer, voluntarily (VOL) with one leg and electrically induced (ES) with the other leg. Assessments from the skeletal muscle were obtained prior to exercise and at 5, 24, 96 and 192 h postexercise. Muscle tenderness rose in VOL and ES after 24 h, and did not differ between groups. Maximal isometric contraction strength, rate of force development and impulse declined in the VOL leg from 4 h after exercise, but not in ES (except at 24 h). In contrast, a significant disruption of cytoskeletal proteins (desmin) and a rise of myogenic growth factors (myogenin) occurred only in ES. Intracellular disruption and destroyed Z-lines were markedly more pronounced in ES (40%) compared with VOL (10%). Likewise, the increase in satellite cell markers [neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and paired-box transcription factor (Pax-7)] was more pronounced in ES versus VOL. Finally, staining of the intramuscular connective tissue (tenascin C) was increased equally in ES and VOL after exercise. The present study demonstrates that in human muscle, the delayed onset of muscle soreness was not significantly different between the two treatments despite marked differences in intramuscular histological markers, in particular myofibre proteins and satellite cell markers. An increase in tenascin C expression in the midbelly of the skeletal muscle in both legs provides further evidence of a potential role for the extracellular matrix in the phenomenon of delayed onset of muscle soreness.

Together these components restrict the diffusion of cells and molecules from the periphery into the central nervous systern (CNS), providing immune privilege and homeostasis. Dysregulation of the BBB and trans-endothelial migration of immune cells are amonast the earliest CNS changes partaking in lesion formation in multiple sclerosis (MS). Death receptors are members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) super-family. They are expressed on a variety of tissues including endothelium, but the consequence of their triggering appears to be cell type specific. In this study, we describe the expression of death receptors TNFR1, Fas and DR5 on primary cultures of human BBB-derived endothelial cells (ECs), as well as the effects of receptor activation on human brain endothelial cell (HBEC) function. We show that HBECs are resistant to cell death mediated via TNFa, FasL and TRAIL and that neither receptor ligation induces cellular proliferation of HBECs. TNFRI ligation induces NFKB activation and the upregulation of chemokines MCP- I and IL-8, as well as adhesion molecules ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1, while Fas and DR5 triggering activate the extracellular signal regulated kinases- 1 and -2 (Erk 1/2, p42/44 MAPK) inducing the release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) by BBB-derived ECs.

Both proteins have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and are components of quartet complexes with noncatalytic subunits containing the bromodomain, plant homeodomain-linked ( PHD) finger and proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline (PWWP)-containing domain, three types of structural modules characteristic of chromatin regulators. Although leukemia-derived fusion proteins such as MOZ-TIF2 promote self-renewal of leukemic stem cells, recent studies indicate that murine MOZ and MORF are important for proper development of hematopoietic and neurogenic progenitors, respectively, thereby highlighting the importance of epigenetic integrity in safeguarding stem cell identity.

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of the novel antineoplastic, the epothilone B analog ixabepilone, in patients with MBC previously treated with an adjuvant anthracycline. Patients and Methods Patients were age >= 18 years and had received a prior anthracycline-based regimen as adjuvant treatment. Ixabepilone as first-line metastatic chemotherapy was administered as a 40 mg/m(2) intravenous infusion during 3 hours every 3 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary efficacy end points included duration of response, time to response, time to progression, and survival. Results All 65 patients were assessable for response. Their median age was 52 years ( range, 33 to 80 years). ORR was 41.5% (95% Cl, 29.4% to 54.4%), median duration of response was 8.2 months (95% Cl, 5.7 to 10.2 months), and median time to response was 6 weeks (range, 5 to 17 weeks). Median survival was 22.0 months (95% Cl, 15.6 to 27.0 months). Treatment- related adverse events were manageable and mostly grades 1/ 2: the most common of these (other than alopecia) was mild to moderate neuropathy, which was primarily sensory and mostly reversible in nature. Conclusion Ixabepilone is efficacious and has a predictable and manageable safety profile in women with MBC previously treated with an adjuvant anthracycline.

Developmental profile of neuregulin receptor ErbB4 in postnatal rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						corticogenesis; development; dendrite; schizophrenia; electron microscopy	TYROSINE KINASE RECEPTORS; CEREBELLAR GRANULE CELLS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RADIAL GLIA; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; NEURONAL MIGRATION; HUMAN BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EXPRESSION	We investigated the cellular and subcellular distributions of neuregulin tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 in the postnatal rat frontal cortex and hippocampus by light-, confocal- and electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry. At birth, Erb84-immunoreactivity (ErbB4-IR) was prominent in the apical cytoplasm and dendrites of cortical plate neurons and hippocampal pyramidal cells. Throughout postnatal development and in adulthood, ErbB4-IR in both regions remained confined to the somatodendritic compartment of neurons, which increased in number to reach the adult pattern by the end of the first postnatal month (P30). At all ages examined, double-labeling experiments revealed that ErbB4-IR always co-localized with the neuronal marker neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and never with glial markers Nestin or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Immunoperoxidase labeling at the ultrastructural level confirmed the exclusive localization of ErbB4-IR in somatodendrites, and notably in dendritic spines. Immunogold labeling showed preponderant ErbB4-IR in the cytoplasm, where it was associated with microtubules. Furthermore, ErbB4-IR was abundant in the nucleus of adult cortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role for ErbB4 nuclear signaling in the brain beyond embryonic development. Taken together, these results show that ErbB4 is expressed by neuronal somatodendrites in cerebral cortex and hippocampus from birth to adulthood, and support a role for neuregulins in dendritic growth and plasticity.

Respiratory rhythms generated in the lamprey rhombencephalon	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						respiration; respiratory rhythm generator; motoneurons; brainstem; vertebrates	PRE-BOTZINGER COMPLEX; CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS; BRAIN-STEM; PERIPHERAL CONTROL; FICTIVE LOCOMOTION; PACEMAKER NEURONS; RANA-CATESBEIANA; LUNG VENTILATION; LARVAL LAMPREY; NEURAL-NETWORK	Brainstem networks generating the respiratory rhythm in lampreys are still not fully characterized. In this study, we described the patterns of respiratory activities and we identified the general location of underlying neural networks. In a semi-intact preparation including the brain and gills, rhythmic discharges were recorded bilaterally with surface electrodes placed over the vagal motoneurons. The main respiratory output driving rhythmic gill movements consisted of short bursts (40.9+/-15.6 ms) of discharge occurring at a frequency of 1.0+/-0.3 Hz. This fast pattern was interrupted by long bursts (506.3+/-174.6 ms) recurring with an average period of 37.4+/-24.9 s. After isolating the brainstem by cutting all cranial nerves, the frequency of the short respiratory bursts did not change significantly, but the slow pattern was less frequent. Local injections of a glutamate agonist (AMPA) and antagonists (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) or D,L-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5)) were made over different brainstem regions to influence respiratory output. The results were similar in the semi-intact and isolated-brainstem preparations. Unilateral injection of AP5 or CNQX over a rostral rhombencephalic region, lateral to the rostral pole of the trigeminal motor nucleus, decreased the frequency of the fast respiratory rhythm bilaterally or stopped it altogether. Injection of AMPA at the same site increased the rate of the fast respiratory rhythm and decreased the frequency of the slow pattern. The activity recorded in this area was synchronous with that recorded over the vagal motoneurons. After a complete transverse lesion of the brainstem caudal to the trigeminal motor nucleus, the fast rhythm was confined to the rostral area, while only the slow activity persisted in the vagal motoneurons. Our results support the hypothesis that normal breathing depends on the activity of neurons located in the rostral rhombencephalon in lampreys, whereas the caudal rhombencephalon generates the slow pattern.

Hemodynamic cerebral correlates of sleep spindles during human non-rapid eye movement sleep	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG)/functional MRI (fMRI); light sleep; neuroimaging; sleep physiology	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; HUMAN THALAMUS; BLOOD-FLOW; WAKE CYCLE; EEG; NUCLEUS; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; RESOLUTION; RHYTHMS	In humans, some evidence suggests that there are two different types of spindles during sleep, which differ by their scalp topography and possibly some aspects of their regulation. To test for the existence of two different spindle types, we characterized the activity associated with slow (11-13 Hz) and fast (13-15 Hz) spindles, identified as discrete events during non-rapid eye movement sleep, in non-sleep-deprived human volunteers, using simultaneous electroencephalography and functional MRI. An activation pattern common to both spindle types involved the thalami, paralimbic areas (anterior cingulate and insular cortices), and superior temporal gyri. No thalamic difference was detected in the direct comparison between slow and fast spindles although some thalamic areas were preferentially activated in relation to either spindle type. Beyond the common activation pattern, the increases in cortical activity differed significantly between the two spindle types. Slow spindles were associated with increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus. In contrast, fast spindles recruited a set of cortical regions involved in sensorimotor processing, as well as the mesial frontal cortex and hippocampus. The recruitment of partially segregated cortical networks for slow and fast spindles further supports the existence of two spindle types during human non-rapid eye movement sleep, with potentially different functional significance.

Several brain imaging studies, however, have reported that the hippocampus is active during the performance of semantic memory tasks. Although this activity may reflect memory encoding, it is also possible that it is due to the process of retrieving the semantic representations of the stimuli. Here we show in two H, 150 positron emission tomography studies that cerebral blood flow (CBF) to the hippocampus covaries with superior performance during the retrieval of general knowledge. Left hippocampal CBF was associated with faster word meaning retrieval and right hippocampal CBF with better picture naming. A follow-up experiment failed to show that faster responding in the word meaning task was associated with better episodic memory for the stimuli and so weakens the proposal that the hippocampal activity was strictly related to memory encoding. In both experiments CBF to the lateral temporal cortex covaried with hippocampal CBF in a way that suggests that the hippocampus provides complementary support to activation within the association cortex.

The extent to which these functional differences are accompanied by abnormal morphology of the brain in stutterers is unclear. This study examined the neuroanatomical differences in speech-related cortex between stutterers and nonstutterers using voxel-based morphometry. Results revealed significant differences in localized grey matter and white matter densities of left and right hemisphere regions involved in auditory processing and speech production.

Segmentation of this stream at event boundaries is necessary for object identification and feature extraction. Here, we investigate the neural dynamics of event segmentation in entire musical symphonies under natural listening conditions. We isolated time-dependent sequences of brain responses in a 10 s window surrounding transitions between movements of symphonic works. A strikingly right-lateralized network of brain regions showed peak response during the movement transitions when, paradoxically, there was no physical stimulus. Model-dependent and model-free analysis techniques provided converging evidence for activity in two distinct functional networks at the movement transition: a ventral fronto-temporal network associated with detecting salient events, followed in time by a dorsal fronto-parietal network associated with maintaining attention and updating working memory. Our study provides direct experimental evidence for dissociable and causally linked ventral and dorsal networks during event segmentation of ecologically valid auditory stimuli.

Polymorphisms of the dopamine D-4 receptor, clinical outcome, and cortical structure in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; GENE 7-REPEAT ALLELE; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; NORMAL-CHILDREN; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; MRI DATA; ADHD; DRD4; ASSOCIATION	Context: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, and a polymorphism within the dopamine D, receptor (DRD4) gene has been frequently implicated in its pathogenesis. Objective: To examine the effects of the 7-repeat microsatellite in the DRD4 gene on clinical outcome and cortical development in ADHD. We drew comparisons with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the dopamine D, receptor (DRD1) gene, which was associated with ADHD within our cohort, and a polymorphism within the dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene, reported to have additive effects with the DRb4 7-repeat allele. Design: Longitudinal cohort study. Setting: National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. Participants: One hundred five children (with 222 neuroanatomical magnetic resonance images) with ADHD (mean age at entry, 10.1 years) and 103 healthy controls (total of 220 magnetic resonance images). Sixty-seven subjects with ADHD (64%) had follow-up clinical evaluations (mean follow-up, 6 years). Main Outcome Measures: Cortical thickness across the cerebrum and presence of DSM-IV-defined ADHD at follow-up. Results: Possession of the DRD4 7-repeat allele was associated with a thinner right orbitofrontal/inferior prefrontal and Posterior parietal cortex. This overlapped with regions that were generally thinner in subjects with ADHD compared with controls. Participants with ADHD carrying the DRD4 7-repeat allele had a better clinical outcome and a distinct trajectory of cortical development. This group showed normalization of the right parietal cortical region, a pattern that we have previously linked with better clinical outcome. By contrast, there were no significant effects of the DRD1 or DAT1 polymorphisms on clinical outcome or cortical development. Conclusions: The DRD4 7-repeat allele, which is widely associated with a diagnosis of ADHD, and in our cohort with better clinical outcome, is associated with cortical thinning in regions important in attentional control. This regional thinning is most apparent in childhood and largely resolves during adolescence.

Risk factors in patients undergoing cricopharyngeal myotomy	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article							UPPER ESOPHAGEAL SPHINCTER; OCULOPHARYNGEAL MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; ZENKERS-DIVERTICULUM; DYSPHAGIA; MANAGEMENT	Background: Cricopharyngeal myotomy for oropharyngeal dysphagia is designed to improve symptoms, but the operation can result in significant morbidity and even death. Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out of all complications and deaths among 253 patients who had cricopharyngeal myotomy performed by a single surgeon. Results: A single wound infection developed among 15 patients with neurological dysphagia. The same patient subsequently required laryngeal exclusion and tracheostomy. Of 139 patients treated for dysphagia secondary to muscular dystrophy, haematoma formation or infection occurred in four, and eight patients developed postoperative pulmonary complications, four of whom died from respiratory distress syndrome. Two patients with myogenic dysphagia required laryngeal exclusion with a permanent tracheostomy. Infection of the wound or retropharyngeal space was the main problem in 90 patients with a pharyngo-oesophageal diverticulum, affecting 9 per cent of the patients. Fistula was documented in three patients overall (1.2 percent). Systemic morbidity unrelated to the technique occurred in 26 patients (10-3 per cent). Conclusion: Pulmonary aspiration and lethal respiratory distress occurred only in patients with myogenic dysphagia. Local infection was the main complication in those with pharyngo-oesophageal diverticulum. Persistent aspiration can lead to laryngeal exclusion or resection with permanent tracheostomy.

Use of the Beck Depression Inventory for assessing depression in patients hospitalized with severe burn disentangling symptoms of depression from injury and treatment factors	BURNS			English	Article						depression; psychosocial; assessment; bias; beck depression inventory	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MEDICALLY ILL; MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; SOMATIC SYMPTOMS; PREVALENCE; VALIDITY; INDIVIDUALS	The objective of this study was to assess whether scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) are biased by injury severity among hospitalized survivors of burn (N = 262). A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model was developed with a general depression factor that loaded on all items and somatic and cognitive factors that were orthogonal to the general factor and to each other. The model fit the data well and substantially better than an alternative three-factor model with correlated factors. Percent total body surface area burned (TBSA) was significantly associated with the general depression factor (p = .04), but also with the orthogonal somatic factor (p < .001), suggesting biased measurement due to overlap between somatic symptoms of depression and the severity of the burn injury. Analysis of item communalities, however, suggested that only approximately 2% of total predicted item variance was associated with bias related to injury severity. It was concluded that, despite a small amount of bias, the BDI is a reasonably accurate clinical tool even in the context of severe burn. Appropriate adjustments for bias, however, should be made in research with the BDI among patients with acute burn. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

Brachial plexus blocks: a review of approaches and techniques	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Review							PERIPHERAL-NERVE STIMULATOR; ARTHROSCOPIC SHOULDER SURGERY; UPPER-LIMB SURGERY; AXILLARY BLOCK; SUCCESS RATE; INFRACLAVICULAR BLOCK; MULTIPLE-INJECTION; SINGLE-INJECTION; SUPRACLAVICULAR BLOCK; ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE	Purpose: The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the evidence derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding established approaches and techniques for brachial plexus anesthesia. Source: Using the MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2006) and EMBASE (January 1980 to November 2006) databases, keywords "brachial plexus", "nerve blocks", "interscalene", "cervical paravertebral", "suprascapular", "supraclavicular", "infraclavicular", "axillary", "brachial canal" and "humeral canal" were searched for full text articles pertaining to the evaluation of recognized approaches and techniques for brachial plexus anesthesia. The search was limited to RCTs involving human subjects and published in the English language. Seventy-six RCTs were identified. Principal findings: Many of the published studies were underpowered and contained various methodological limitations. We found that, for shoulder and proximal humeral surgery, interscalene and cervical paravertebral approaches to the brachial plexus appear to provide equally effective surgical anesthesia. Intersternocleidomastoid supraclavicular blocks are not associated with improved postoperative analgesia despite eliciting more complete anesthesia of the brachial plexus. For surgery at or below the elbow, an infraclavicular block may result in decreased performance time and block-related pain while providing similar efficacy compared to (multiple-stimulation) axillary and brachial canal approaches. With respect to technique, it is unclear if nerve stimulation provides a more effective interscalene block than elicitation of paresthesiae. For supraclavicular blocks, nerve stimulation with a minimal threshold of 0.9 mA is recommended, whereas a double-stimulation technique is optimal for infraclavicular blocks. For the axillary approach, a triple-stimulation technique, involving injections of the musculocutaneous, median and radial nerves, is the most effective option. Conclusions: Published reports of RCTs provide evidence to formulate limited recommendations regarding optimal approaches and techniques for brachial plexus anesthesia. Further well-designed and meticulously executed RCTs are warranted, particularly in light of new techniques involving ultrasound or combining neurostimulation and echoguidance.

Introduction to Functional Data Analysis	CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGY-PSYCHOLOGIE CANADIENNE			English	Article								Psychologists and behavioural scientists are increasingly collecting data that are drawn from continuous underlying processes. We describe a set of quantitative methods, Functional Data Analysis (FDA), which can answer a number of questions that traditional statistical approaches cannot. These methods are applicable for analyzing many datasets that are common in experimental psychology, including time series data, repeated measures, and data distributed over time or space as in neuroimaging experiments. The primary advantage of FDA is that it allows the researcher to ask questions about when in a time series differences may exist between two or more sets of observations. We discuss functional correlations, principal components, the derivatives of functional curves, and analysis of variances models.

This study was done with a view to analyze our experience with this group of patients and to define the changes in the surgical technique over the last 15 years. We also describe the microsurgical technique of the different surgical variants used, along with their functional neuroanatomy. Methods: In this series there were 13 patients with a median age of 17 years. All patients had extensive presurgical evaluation that provided concordant evidence localizing the lesion and seizure focus to the posterior quadrant. The objective of the surgery was to eliminate the effect of the epileptogenic tissue and preserve motor and sensory functions. Results: During the course of this study period of 15 years, the surgical procedure performed evolved toward incorporating more techniques of disconnection and minimizing resection. Three technical variants were thus utilized in this series, namely, (i) anatomical posterior quadrantectomy (APQ), (ii) functional posterior quadrantectomy (FPQ), and (iii) periinsular posterior quadrantectomy (PIPQ). After a median follow-up period of 6 years, 12/13 patients had Engel's Class I seizure outcome. Conclusion: The results of surgery for posterior quadrantic epilepsy have yielded excellent seizure outcomes in 92% of the patients in the series with no mortality or major morbidity. The incorporation of disconnective techniques in multilobar surgery has maintained the excellent results obtained earlier with resective surgery.

Here, we assessed the effects of aging on the brain regional alpha-[ C-11] methyl- L- tryptophan (alpha-[C-11] MTrp) trapping rate constant (K*; mu l . g(-1).min(-1)), which, with certain assumptions, could be taken as a proxy of 5- HT synthesis. Methods Thirty- six healthy right- handed subjects had positron emission tomography (PET) scans following injection with alpha-[C-11] MTrp [ 18 males aged 46.6 +/- 22.2 years (range 20 - 80 years) and 18 females aged 33.0 +/- 15.5 years (range 20 - 80 years)]. The trapping rate constant, K*, was calculated with the graphical method for irreversible ligands using the sinus- venous input function. A priori selected volumes of interest (VOIs) were defined using an automatic algorithm. Results VOI analysis showed no correlation between age and brain regional K* values. As reported by others, significant age- related reductions of gray matter were observed in the thalamus and frontal and cingulate cortices; even with partial volume correction there was still no significant relationship between K* and age. Further exploratory SPM voxelwise correlation between age and a-[C-11] MTrp trapping, using p= 0.05 (uncorrected), as well as voxel- based morphometry, was in agreement with the VOI analysis. Conclusion The dissociation between age- related changes in brain anatomy and this index of serotonin synthesis suggests independent mechanisms underlying the normal aging process.

Using the Infinite Horizon Tissue Impactor to produce these contusion injuries, we were able to set strict limits on the injury parameters (i.e., force of impact and tissue displacement). This helps to generate a uniform population of spinal cord injury severity and allows for meaningful comparisons to be made across the two strains of mice. After contusion injury, strain differences were apparent in several injury-evoked behaviors such as hindlimb spasticity, spontaneous caudally directed nociceptive behaviors and over-grooming. Similar to the anatomical rearrangements observed in the rat after spinal cord injury, we observed significant changes in sensory innervation of the dorsal horn in both strains. In addition, there was increased expression of protein kinase C gamma (PKC gamma) in cells outside of the inner region of lamina 11 (IIi) in both strains after spinal contusion injury. However, the magnitude and intensity of this increase was more pronounced in BALB/c mice. PKC gamma is an important mediator of persistent pain behaviors after peripheral nerve injury and inflammation. Our results suggest that PKC gamma may also contribute to neuropathic pain behaviors after direct lesion to the spinal cord. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Symbolic and nonsymbolic modes of mental functioning are first outlined Supportive interventions are redefined as an analyst effort at improving a patient nonsymbolic mental functioning, by using principally pragmatic or interactive aspects of communication to deal with her or his patient nonsymbolic in-session experiences. These interventions are psychoanalytic when transference focused, in so far as they foster the symbolization and transformation of more primitive (nonsymbolic) layers of the transference. Some probable mechanisms underlying the effect of supportive interventions on nonsymbolic functioning include the modification of mental procedures. Supportive interventions also help restore symbolic mental elaboration through the gratification of a basic ego or self-need, bringing about a temporary relief from psychic pain, with increased affect tolerance and a renewed capacity to use symbols. This soothing effect accounts for a missing link in Bion model of the elaborative effect of the analyst reverie.

In a panic, she came upstairs from the den with a protruding right eye. When used as a make-believe telescope, the tube of wrapping paper was the perfect diameter to fit within the orbit's bony limits and around the globe. A small force to the tip of the tube held up to the eye was sufficient to propel the eyelids backward while luxating the globe forward. Visual acuity in the eye deteriorated within 2 hours but the vision loss was reversed entirely with prompt reduction under general anesthesia. While not intended as such, the gift-wrap tube has long been a popular play instrument for children around the holidays. This case illustrates the risk of luxating an eye with a gift-wrap tube and the benefits of prompt reduction of a traumatically luxated globe with traumatic optic neuropathy.

We measured serial plasma big-endothelin (Big-ET), ET-1, N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in 206 patients randomized to bucindolol or placebo in Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST). Methods and Results: Neurohormones were measured at baseline and 3 and 12 months. At baseline, BNP and Big-ET levels were greater in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV than in Class III patients (median 122 pg/mL versus 447 pg/mL, P =.001; and 20.0 pg/mL versus 9.9 pg/mL, P =.003), and in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <= 20% compared with LVEF > 20% (median 211 pg/mL versus 99.1 pg/mL; and 12.9 pg/mL versus 8.0 pg/mL, both P =.003). Big-ET and BNP were the strongest predictors of the composite end point of CHF hospitalization or death. LVEF at 12 months correlated inversely with 12-month BNP levels (r = -0.41, P =.0001). Bucindolol had no effect on neurohormones except that bucindolol treated patients had lower Big-ET levels at 3 months than patients receiving placebo (median 9.1 pg/mL versus 10.9 pg/mL, P =.05). A decline in ET-1 was associated with increased risk of the composite endpoint. Conclusions: Lack of effect of bucindolol on natriuretic peptide levels appears consistent with its overall lack of efficacy in BEST.

Inhibition of different pathophysiological mechanisms involved in hypertension and hypertension -related target organ damage may revert or prevent the progression of the pathological changes observed and reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular events. One of the new targets that may prevent or regress hypertensive vascular, renal, and perhaps brain changes in hypertension is the activation of nuclear receptors that have metabolic effects but also exert antiinflammatory action, the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) activators alpha and gamma. This review will discuss some of the evidence, both experimental and clinical, that suggests that activation of PPAR alpha and/or gamma in hypertension may exert beneficial cardiovascular protective effects.

The broad spectrum of severity, with onset from the prenatal period to adulthood, presents unique challenges in the design and implementation of clinical trials. The clinical classification of subjects into severe (type 1), intermediate (type 2), and mild (type 3) subtyes has proved useful both in enhancing communication among clinicians internationally and in forging the collaborative development of outcome measures for clinical trials. Ideally, clinical trial design in spinal muscular atrophy must take into account the spinal muscular atrophy type, patient age, severity-of-affection status, nature of the therapeutic approach, timing of the proposed intervention relative to disease progression, and relative homogeneity of the cohort to be Studied. Following is an overview of the challenges and opportunities, current and future therapeutic strategies, and progress to date in clinical trials in spinal muscular atrophy.

The pathogenesis of both systemic and CNS infections caused by S. suis is poorly understood. A hematogenous model of infection in CD1 mice was developed to study the systemic release of cytokines during the septic shock phase and the proinflammatory events in the CNS associated with this pathogen. Using a liquid array system, high levels of systemic TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-gamma, CCL2, CXCL1, and CCL5 were observed 24 It after infection and might be responsible for the sudden death of 20% of animals. Infected mice that survived the early sepsis later developed clinical signs of meningitis and exhibited lesions in the meninges and in numerous regions of the brain, such as the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and corpus callosum. Bacterial Ags were found in association with microglia residing only in the affected zones. In situ hybridization combined with immunocytochemistry showed transcriptional activation of TLR2 and TLR3 as well as CD14, NF-kappa B, IL-1 beta, CCL2, and TNF-alpha, mainly in myeloid cells located in affected cerebral structures. Early transcriptional activation of TLR2, CD14, and inflammatory cytokines in the choroid plexus and cells lining the brain endothelium suggests that these structures are potential entry sites for the bacteria into the CNS. Our data indicate an important role of the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of S. suis infection in mice. This experimental model may be useful for studying the mechanisms underlying sepsis and meningitis during bacterial infection.

The extent and the mechanism of the inhibitory cross-talks between these two classes of ionotropic receptors remain poorly understood, however. Both ionic and molecular coupling were proposed to explain cross-inhibition between P2X subtypes and GABA(A) receptors, suggesting a P2X subunit-dependent mechanism. We show here that cross-inhibition between neuronal P2X(3) or P2X(2+3) and GABA(A) receptors does not depend on chloride and calcium ions. We identified an intracellular QST(386-388) motif in P2X(3) subunits which is required for the functional coupling with GABA(A) receptors. Moreover the cross-inhibition between native P2X(3) and GABA receptors in cultured rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons is abolished by infusion of a peptide containing the QST motif as well as by viral expression of the main intracellular loop of GABA(A) beta 3 subunits. We provide evidence that P2X(3) and GABA(A) receptors are colocalized in the soma and central processes of nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting that specific intracellular P2X(3)-GABA(A) subunit interactions underlie a pre-synaptic cross-talk that might contribute to the regulation of sensory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord.

Approximately 60% of individuals report either having difficulty performing or being unable to carry out some activities related to home management, mobility and transportation, work and leisure. Employment, educational level and income are, on average, lower than in the general population. The complexity and variability of disease manifestations in DM1 undoubtedly pose a challenge as regards anticipating all potential problems and developing a plan for health and community management. This article presents a conceptual model for DM1 management as well as a brief discussion of an approach for developing interdisciplinary health and community services.

Frames of reference for gaze saccades evoked during stimulation of lateral intraparietal cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review							POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; HEAD MOVEMENTS; 3-DIMENSIONAL EYE; RHESUS-MONKEYS; VISUAL SPACE; COLLIDING SACCADES; NEURAL MECHANISMS	Previous studies suggest that stimulation of lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) evokes saccadic eye movements toward eye- or head-fixed goals, whereas most single-unit studies suggest that LIP uses an eye-fixed frame with eye-position modulations. The goal of our study was to determine the reference frame for gaze shifts evoked during LIP stimulation in head-unrestrained monkeys. Two macaques (M1 and M2) were implanted with recording chambers over the right intraparietal sulcus and with search coils for recording three-dimensional eye and head movements. The LIP region was microstimulated using pulse trains of 300 Hz, 100-150 mu A, and 200 ms. Eighty-five putative LIP sites in M1 and 194 putative sites in M2 were used in our quantitative analysis throughout this study. Average amplitude of the stimulation-evoked gaze shifts was 8.67 degrees for M1 and 7.97 degrees for M2 with very small head movements. When these gaze-shift trajectories were rotated into three coordinate frames (eye, head, and body), gaze endpoint distribution for all sites was most convergent to a common point when plotted in eye coordinates. Across all sites, the eye-centered model provided a significantly better fit compared with the head, body, or fixed-vector models (where the latter model signifies no modulation of the gaze trajectory as a function of initial gaze position). Moreover, the probability of evoking a gaze shift from any one particular position was modulated by the current gaze direction (independent of saccade direction). These results provide causal evidence that the motor commands from LIP encode gaze command in eye-fixed coordinates but are also subtly modulated by initial gaze position.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the oxidative degradation of heme to ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, is upregulated in affected PD astroglia and may contribute to abnormal mitochondrial iron sequestration in these cells. To determine whether glial HO-1 hyper-expression is toxic to neuronal compartments, we co-cultured dopaminergic PC12 cells atop monolayers of human (h) HO-1 transfected, sham-transfected, or non-transfected primary rat astroglia. We observed that PC12 cells grown atop hHO-1 transfected astrocytes, but not the astroglia themselves, were significantly more susceptible to dopamine (1 mu M) + H2O2 (1 mu M)-induced death (assessed by nuclear ethidium monoazide bromide staining and anti-tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence microscopy) relative to control preparations. In the experimental group, PC12 cell death was attenuated significantly by the administration of the HO inhibitor, SnMP (1.5 mu M), the antioxidant, ascorbate (200 mu M), or the iron chelators, deferoxamine (400 mu M), and phenanthroline (100 mu M). Exposure to conditioned media derived from HO-1 transfected astrocytes also augmented PC12 cell killing in response to dopamine (11 mu M) + H2O2 (1 mu M) relative to control media. In PD brain, overexpression of HO-1 in nigral astroglia and accompanying iron liberation may facilitate the bioactivation of dopamine to neurotoxic free radical intermediates and predispose nearby neuronal constituents to oxidative damage.

Dynamic phases of peroneal and tibial intraneural ganglia formation: a new dimension added to the unifying articular theory	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						articular theory; cyst regression; fluid dynamics; ganglion cyst; intraneural ganglion; peroneal nerve; sciatic nerve; tibial nerve	INTRASPINAL SYNOVIAL CYST; PROXIMAL TIBIOFIBULAR JOINT; SCIATIC-NERVE; ATLANTOAXIAL INSTABILITY; SPONTANEOUS RESOLUTION; SPONTANEOUS REGRESSION; POPLITEAL; BRANCH; INVOLVEMENT; DISEASE	Object. The pathogenesis of intraneural ganglia has been a controversial issue for longer than a century. Recently the authors identified a stereotypical pattern of occurrence of peroneal and tibial intraneural ganglia, and based on an understanding of their pathogenesis provided a unifying articular explanation. Atypical features, which occasionally are observed, have offered an opportunity to verify further and expand on the authors' proposed theory. Methods. Three unusual cases are presented to exemplify the dynamic features of peroneal and tibial intraneural ganglia formation. Results. Two patients with a predominant deep peroneal nerve deficit shared essential anatomical findings common to peroneal intraneural ganglia: namely, 1) joint connections to the anterior portion of the superior tibiofibular joint, and 2) dissection of the cyst along the articular branch of the peroneal nerve and proximally. Magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in these patients demonstrated some unusual findings, including the presence of a cyst within the tibial and sural nerves in the popliteal fossa region, and spontaneous regression of the cysts, which was observed on serial images obtained weeks apart. The authors identified a clinical outlier, a case that could not be understood within the context of their previously reported theory of intraneural ganglion cyst formation. Described 32 years ago, this patient had a tibial neuropathy and was found at surgery to have tibial, peroneal, and sciatic intraneural cysts without a joint connection. The authors' hypothesis about this case, based on their unified theory, was twofold: 1) the lesion was a primary tibial intraneural ganglion with proximal extension followed by sciatic cross-over and distal descent; and 2) a joint connection to the posterior aspect of the superior tibiofibular joint with a remnant cyst within the articular branch would be present, a finding that would help explain the formation of different cysts by a single mechanism. The authors proved their hypothesis by careful inspection of a recently obtained postoperative MR image. Conclusions. These three cases together with data obtained from a retrospective review of the authors' clinical material and findings reported in the literature provide firm evidence for mechanisms underlying intraneural ganglia formation. Thus, expansion of the authors' unified articular theory permits understanding and elucidation of unusual presentations of intraneural cysts. Whereas an articular connection and fluid following the path of least resistance was pivotal, the authors now incorporate dynamic aspects of cyst formation due to pressure fluxes. These basic principles explain patterns of ascent, cross-over, and descent down terminal nerve branches based on articular connections, paths of diminished resistance to fluid flow within recognized anatomical compartments, and the effects of fluctuating pressure gradients.

Neuroimaging revealed bilateral anomalous vessels arising at the level of each ophthalmic artery, coursing rostromedially to join the anterior communicating artery (ACA), which harbored an aneurysm. Intraoperatively, the authors identified an abnormal gyral segmentation of the frontoorbital region, with a median gyrus separated from the olfactory tracts on each side by the gyrus rectus. No interhemispheric fissure was observed in the exposed area. This is the first report in the literature of an abnormal gyral segmentation in association with an infraoptic course of an ACA. Recognition of this possible gyral abnormality in association with this vascular anomaly is relevant for surgical exposure and treatment of aneurysms by clip placement.

This study evaluates the analgesic activity of tetrodotoxin, a highly selective sodium channel blocker, in cancer pain. A Phase IIa, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of intramuscular tetrodotoxin was conducted in patients with severe, unrelieved cancer pain. The study design called for six ascending dose levels of intramuscular tetrodotoxin, administered over a four-day treatment period in hospitalized patients, with six patients to be enrolled within each successive dose level. Twenty-four patients underwent 31 courses of treatment at doses ranging from 13 to 90 mu g daily, administered in divided doses, over four days. Most patients described transient perioral tingling or outer mild sensory phenomena within about an hour of each treatment. Nausea and other toxicities were generally mild, but two patients experienced a serious adverse event, truncal anal gait ataxia, that resolved over loss. Seventeen of 31 treatments resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in pain intensity, and relief of pain persisted for up to two weeks or longer. Two patients had opioids held due to narcosis concurrent with relief of pain. Somatic, visceral, or neuropathic pain could all respond, but it was not, possible to predict which patients were more likely to have an analgesic effect. Tetrodotoxin was overall safe.

In Studies I and 2, AP was correlated with D-PFCA (r = .37, p < .01, and r = .33, p < .01, respectively), IQ (r = .24, p < .05, and r = .38, p < .01, respectively), and Conscientiousness (r = .26, p < .05, and r = .37, p < .01, respectively). D-PFCA remained significant in regression analyses controlling for intelligence (or g) and personality. Studies 3 and 4 assessed D-PFCA, personality, and workplace performance among (a) managerial-administrative workers and (b) factory floor workers at a manufacturing company. Prefrontal cognitive ability correlated with supervisor ratings of manager performance at values of r ranging from .42 to .57 (ps < .001), depending on experience, and with factory floor performance at pr = .21 (p = .02), after controlling for experience, age, and education. Conscientiousness correlated with factory floor performance at r = .23.

Syringomyelia in cavalier King Charles spaniels: the relationship between syrinx dimensions and pain	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article							OCCIPITAL BONE HYPOPLASIA; I MALFORMATION	OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to test the hypothesis that pain associated with syringomyelia in dogs is dependent upon size and involvement of the dorsal part of the spinal cord. METHODS: Masked observers determined syrinx dimensions and precise location within the spinal cord on magnetic resonance images of 55 cavalier King Charles spaniels with syringomyelia. After removal of masking, syrinx size and location were compared between the cohorts of dogs that exhibited pain with those that did not. RESULTS: Maximum syrinx width was the strongest predictor of pain, scratching behaviour and scoliosis in dogs with syringomyelia. Both pain and syrinx size were positively correlated with syrinxes located in the dorsal half of the spinal cord. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Large syrinxes associated with damage to the dorsal part of the spinal cord are associated with persistent pain suggesting that the pain behaviour expressed by this group of patients is likely to be "neuropathic pain," resulting from disordered neural processing in the damaged dorsal horn. As such it is likely that conventional analgesic medication may be ineffective.

The fact that the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), the largest RCT to date, failed to find that estrogen therapy (ET) had a protective effect against cognitive aging led to the formulation of the critical period hypothesis which holds that ET will effectively protect against memory decline when it is initiated around the time of menopause but not when considerable time has elapsed since the menopause. Evidence from basic neuroscience, and from rodent, nonhuman primate, and human studies that supports this theory is presented. Although much work remains to be done on the timing of initiation of treatment, on the most effective hormonal compounds and on their routes of administration, the hope is that, eventually, hormonal treatments may be able to attenuate or prevent the decline in aspects of cognition that occur with normal aging.

Methods: The Montreal General Hospital Traumatic Brain Injury Registry was used to identify all adult patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8 at admission, within a 15-month period. All charts were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Twenty-three patients had toxic blood alcohol levels (BAL >= 21.7 mmol/L), 24 were alcohol negative (BAL < 3 mmol/L), and 10 were alcohol-influenced or had unknown BAL. Patients were more likely to have intracranial pressure monitoring if they had multiple intracranial hemorrhages, sustained multiple injuries, or had a postresuscitative Glasgow Coma Scale score <= 8. Intoxicated patients had a mean delay of 151 minutes more in the insertion time of an intracranial pressure monitoring device, compared with alcohol-negative patients.

Cancer is predominantly a disease in the population aged 65 years and older. Previous studies have suggested that older cancers patients seen in oncology departments are healthy with few comorbidities. Relatively little is known about the health and functional status of older cancer inpatients, especially outside oncology units. The purpose of this study is to compare the health and functional status of older cancer and noncancer inpatients admitted to a geriatric/ internal medicine unit. Methods. A retrospective chart review was conducted on inpatients 65 years old and older, who had been hospitalized during a period of 2 years in the geriatric/internal medicine unit. The health and functional status of 144 inpatients with active cancer was compared to that of 682 inpatients without active cancer. Eight domains were compared: functional status, comorbidity, medication, nutritional status, neurosensory deficits, cognition, mood, and mobility. The hospitalization measures (length of stay, death, need for palliative care) were also compared. Results. We found that inpatients with active cancer were younger, had less comorbidity and less cognitive impairment, but were more depressed and at greater risk for malnutrition than patients without cancer. These two groups were similar in terms of functional status, neurosensory deficit, and mobility. Cancer patients had a significantly shorter length of stay, required more palliative care, and were more likely to die during hospitalization. Conclusion. These findings indicate that older cancer patients admitted to a geriatric/internal medicine unit present with multiple active geriatric problems, have characteristics distinct from those of traditional geriatric patients, and require specific care and management.

Distinctive and reliable biomarkers of AD are now available through structural MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid 0 or tau proteins. The timeliness of these criteria is highlighted by the many drugs in development that are directed at changing pathogenesis, particularly at the production and clearance of amyloid 0 as well as at the hyperphosphorylation state of tau. Validation studies in existing and prospective cohorts are needed to advance these criteria and optimise their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

Neuroendocrine disruption in Mya arenaria clams during gametogenesis at sites under pollution stress	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						gametogenesis; vitellogenin-like proteins; serotonin/dopamine ratio; oxidative stress; inflammation; Mya arenaria	ELLIPTIO-COMPLANATA MUSSELS; S-TRANSFERASE ACTIVITY; PATINOPECTEN-YESSOENSIS; ASPARTATE-TRANSCARBAMYLASE; REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE; DIGESTIVE GLAND; MYTILUS-EDULIS; SAGUENAY FJORD; GLUTATHIONE; ESTRADIOL-17-BETA	This study examined the neuroendocrine status of clams on intertidal mud flats in the St. Lawrence Estuary and Saguenay Fjord areas during late gametogenesis. The impact of pollution was determined by a test battery of early stress markers (metal lothioneins, heme levels, glutathione Stransferase activity), tissue damage (lipid peroxidation and DNA damage) and morphologic characteristics (age, soft-tissue weight ratio and growth index). Neuroendocrinal status was examined by tracking serotonin and dopamine metabolism, monoamine adenylate cyclase activity in synapto-somes, monoamine oxidase and arachidonate cyclooxygenase activities in relation to gametogenetic activity: pyrimidine synthesis, (aspartate transcarbarnoylase activity or ATC), vitellogenin-like proteins and gonado-somatic index. The results show that clam soft tissue weights were reduced at sites close to harbours and higher at sites near domestic wastewater outfalls. The age-to-length ratio of clams was generally higher at impacted sites, suggesting reduced growth. The biomarkers of stress or damage confirmed that oxidative stress, DNA damage, metallothioneins and glutathione S-transferase activity were significantly increased at varying degrees, at the polluted sites. Vitellogenin-like proteins and gametogenetic activity were significantly increased at sites influenced by domestic wastewaters. Furthermore, the clams were still in active gametogenesis and not ready for spawning, as indicated by the concordance of the serotonin/dopamine ratio with vitellogenin-like proteins and pyrimidine synthesis. However, gonadal cyclooxygenase activity was increased at polluted sites and significantly correlated with most of the stress biomarkers, suggesting that the clams were in a state of inflammation rather than at the spawning stage. Finally, a multivariate analysis revealed that the sites were readily discriminated with high efficiency (> 7 1 %) and that both neuroendocrine physiological markers and stress responses were identified as the major components, thus explaining the global physiological response of the clams. We conclude that the effects of pollution compromise the clams' health status and that the initiation of gametogenesis in environments contaminated by municipal wastewaters or harbours contributes to the toxic effects of pollution.

Validation of vessel-based registration for correction of brain shift	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						brain shift; doppler ultrasound; registration	MR-IMAGES; ULTRASOUND; DEFORMATION; NEURONAVIGATION; COMPENSATION; NEUROSURGERY; CRANIOTOMY; GUIDANCE	The displacement and deformation of brain tissue is a major source of error in image-guided neurosurgery systems. We have designed and implemented a method to detect and correct brain shift using pre-operative MR images and intraoperative Doppler ultrasound data and present its validation with both real and simulated data. The algorithm uses segmented vessels from both modalities, and estimates the deformation using a modified version of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. We use the least trimmed squares (LTS) to reduce the number of outliers in the point matching procedure. These points are used to drive a thin-plate spline transform to achieve non-linear registration. Validation was completed in two parts. First, the technique was tested and validated using realistic simulations where the results were compared to the known deformation. The registration technique recovered 75% of the deformation in the region of interest accounting for deformations as large as 20 mm. Second, we performed a PVA-cryogel phantom study where both MR and ultrasound images of the phantom were obtained for three different deformations. The registration results based on MR data were used as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of the ultrasound based registration. On average, deformations of 7.5 mm magnitude were corrected to within 1.6 mm for the ultrasound based registration and 1.07 mm for the MR based registration. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Parkin-mediated monoubiquitination of the PDZ protein PICK1 regulates the activity of acid-sensing ion channels	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL			English	Article							AMPA RECEPTOR TRAFFICKING; UBIQUITIN LIGASE ACTIVITY; LEWY-BODY FORMATION; KINASE-C-ALPHA; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; BINDING-PROTEIN; JUVENILE PARKINSONISM; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; ACTIVATED CURRENTS	Mutations in the parkin gene result in an autosomal recessive juvenile-onset form of Parkinson's disease. As an E3 ubiquitin-ligase, parkin promotes the attachment of ubiquitin onto specific substrate proteins. Defects in the ubiquitination of parkin substrates are therefore believed to lead to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Here, we identify the PSD-95/Discs-large/Zona Occludens-1 (PDZ) protein PICK1 as a novel parkin substrate. We find that parkin binds PICK1 via a PDZ-mediated interaction, which predominantly promotes PICK1 monoubiquitination rather than polyubiquitination. Consistent with monoubiquitination and recent work implicating parkin in proteasome-independent pathways, parkin does not promote PICK1 degradation. However, parkin regulates the effects of PICK1 on one of its other PDZ partners, the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC). Overexpression of wild-type, but not PDZ binding- or E3 ubiquitinligase-defective parkin abolishes the previously described, protein kinase C-induced, PICK1-dependent potentiation of ASIC2a currents in non-neuronal cells. Conversely, the loss of parkin in hippocampal neurons from parkin knockout mice unmasks prominent potentiation of native ASIC currents, which is normally suppressed by endogenous parkin in wild-type neurons. Given that ASIC channels contribute to excitotoxicity, our work provides a mechanism explaining how defects in parkin-mediated PICK1 monoubiquitination could enhance ASIC activity and thereby promote neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.

Such altered hedonic capacity is likely the result of a basic neuropsychophysiological dysfunction and a vulnerability marker that potentially precedes and contributes to the liability of developing psychiatric disorders. The characterization of the structural and functional neural correlates of trait anhedonia in nonclinical individuals may provide new insights for the early detection of such psychiatric diseases. Twenty-nine non-clinical subjects were scanned at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Trait anhedonia was measured using the Chapman Revised Physical Anhedonia Scale. Semi-automated and automated structural MRI segmentation techniques were used to explore structural correlates of trait anhedonia. Seventeen of the 29 subjects also underwent a functional imaging task where responses to the viewing of affective stimuli were examined to identify the functional correlates of trait anhedonia. Trait anhedonia was inversely related to anterior caudate volume, but positively related to ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity during the processing of positive information. These findings may reflect a specific kind of vulnerability for the development of psychiatric affective disorders and suggest that trait anhedonia may be linked to a volumetric reduction in the basal ganglia and to a prefrontal functional abnormality during hedonic processing.

In a genome- wide association study we found highly significant associations between RLS and intronic variants in the homeobox gene MEIS1, the BTBD9 gene encoding a BTB(POZ) domain as well as variants in a third locus containing the genes encoding mitogen- activated protein kinase MAP2K5 and the transcription factor LBXCOR1 on chromosomes 2p, 6p and 15q, respectively. Two independent replications confirmed these association signals. Each genetic variant was associated with a more than 50% increase in risk for RLS, with the combined allelic variants conferring more than half of the risk. MEIS1 has been implicated in limb development, raising the possibility that RLS has components of a developmental disorder.

There are two views regarding the processing role of this brain region in comprehending these dependencies. Specifists hold that Broca's area plays a specific syntactic role in processing filler-gaps. Generalists maintain that as the on-line linking of fillers and gaps taxes Working Memory (WM) resources, Broca's area supports a domain general WM. The current fMRI study tested these two views in a grammatically judgment task, where participants were presented with two syntactically distinct dependency relations: (a) Filler-Gap and (b) Reflexive Binding. The distance between the dependent elements within each of the constructions was varied, to parametrically vary WM demands. The Generalists would expect parametric variation of distance in both dependencies to lead to a linear increase in activation of Broca's area. Our results support the specifists' view, however: the left inferior frontal gyrus demonstrated an interaction between distance and dependency type with a positive linear effect only for Filler-Gaps. A positive linear effect of distance across both dependencies was only found in the bilateral parahippocampal/ fusiform gyri. Therefore the role of Broca's area in WM is syntactically specific to filler-gap relations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The metabolic consequences of the cell ectopias were determined by estimating cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity, a marker of neuronal activity. CO activity increased in the granular cell layer of dorsal cochlear nucleus, trapezoid body nucleus, intermediate lateral lemniscus, central and external inferior colliculus, and pyramidal cell layer of primary auditory cortex. On the contrary, CO activity decreased in the superficial molecular layer of dorsal cochlear nucleus as well as in the medioventral periolivary nucleus. These metabolic variations are discussed in terms of their possible relation to morphologic anomalies observed in the mutant. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Motor cortex excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms were studied in athletes using four different transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols, namely 1) resting motor threshold, 2) intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation in a paired-pulse paradigm, 3) excitability of the corticospinal system using an input-output curve, and 4) intracortical inhibition in a cortical silent-period paradigm. Motor-evoked potentials were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the right hand. RESULTS: Cortical silent-period duration in athletes who have experienced multiple concussions was prolonged when compared to that of normal control participants. Linear regression suggested that concussion severity was the main factor explaining motor cortex dysfunction. Moreover, when we retested the athletes, the cortical silent period was more prolonged in those who sustained another concussion after baseline testing had occurred. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study indicate that sports-related concussions result in long-term motor system dysfunctions that seem to be attributable to subclinical intracortical inhibitory system abnormalities. This study also shows that sustaining subsequent concussions exacerbates this deficit, and thus provides additional support for the contention that the adverse effects of sports-related concussions on intracortical inhibitory systems are cumulative.

Localization and distribution of NOS1 in murine airways	NITRIC OXIDE-BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						trachea; nitric oxide synthase; airway epithelium; PGP9.5; immunocytochemistry	NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; ASTHMA; EXPRESSION; GENE; INDUCTION; PULMONARY; NEURONS; LUNG; MICE	Nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOSI) is a major determinant of bronchial responsiveness in mice and has been proposed as an asthma gene in man. Nevertheless, how nitric oxide production by NOSI contributes to airway responsiveness remains unclear. Although NOSI is usually closely associated with nerves, it has also been found in a variety of other cell types, particularly epithelium. We sought to better understand the role of NOS1 by determining its major site of expression in murine airways. Using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (diaphorase), which non-selectively detects nitric oxide synthase (NOS), we found strong evidence of NOS in the airways largely restricted to the airway epithelium and trachea glands. In contrast, diaphorase staining of NOS1-deficient mutant mice demonstrated a marked reduction in epithelial cells of the trachea but not bronchioles, suggesting that the epithelium is the major site of NOSI expression. This was supported by immunohistochemistry, which also demonstrated significant staining in glands and to a lesser degree in airway smooth muscle. Double immunofluorescence staining of tracheas for NOS 1 and the nerve marker PGP 9.5 failed to demonstrate co-localization, indicating that nerves are not an important source of NOSI in the murine airway wall. Finally, removal of the trachea epithelium by digestion resulted in a marked decrease in NOS I detection by Western blotting, confirming the epithelium as the major site of NOSI expression in the murine airway. These findings support the notion that the role of NOSI in murine bronchial responsiveness involves the epithelium of the central airways. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Bisulfite sequencing and combined bisulfite restriction assay were performed to confirm the methylation status of this CpG island in primary medulloblastomas and medulloblastoma cell lines. Hypermethylation was detected in 16/23 (70%) biopsies and 7/8 (87%) medulloblastoma cell lines, but not in nonneoplastic fetal (n=8) cerebellum. Expression of SGNE1 was investigated by semi-quantitative competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and found to be significantly downregulated or absent in all, but one primary medulloblastomas and all cell lines compared to fetal cerebellum. After treatment of medulloblastoma cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, transcription of SGNE1 was restored. No mutation was found in the coding region of SGNE1 by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Reintroduction of SGNE1 into the medulloblastoma cell line D283Med led to a significant growth suppression and reduced colony formation. In summary, we have identified SGNE1 as a novel epigenetically silenced gene in medulloblastomas. Its frequent inactivation, as well as its inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation and focus formation strongly argues for a significant role in medulloblastoma development.

We propose a pairwise fusion matrix (PFM) transformation, which produces reliable probabilities for the use of classifier combination and can be amalgamated with most existent fusion functions for combining classifiers. The PFM requires only crisp class label outputs from classifiers, and is suitable for high-class problems or problems with few training samples. Experimental results suggest that the performance of a PFM can be a notch above that of the simple majority voting rule (MAJ), and a PFM can work on problems where a behavior-knowledge space (BKS) might not be applicable.

Some of the ELSIs, such as ensuring privacy of genetic information and implications of genetic testing for health insurance and employment, may be shared across the continuum of genomic technology applications in human disease genetics, pharmacogenomics and nutrigenomics. However, there are certain aspects of nutrigenomics research that may result in unique or unprecedented ELSIs. For example, nutrigenomics has a strong focus on public health and the prevention/modification of 'predisease phenotypes' in apparently healthy individuals. Thus, in contrast to previous applications of genomics technologies, where the goal is to distinguish existing disease from absence of disease, the aim of nutrigenomics is the discernment of nuanced differences in predisease states. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that ELSIs may be different in biomarker discovery, translational research and clinical testing stages of nutrigenomics. Ideally, ELSI research and nutrigenomics bioscience should progress in parallel and in a commensurate manner. We suggest that qualitative research methods, using a hypothesis-free approach, can be employed to gain deeper insights on complex bioethics issues that do not ordinarily lend themselves to formal hypothesis testing with the quantitative methods used in biomedical sciences.

J	Dawson, M; Soulieres, I; Gernsbacher, MA; Mottron, L				Dawson, Michelle; Soulieres, Isabelle; Gernsbacher, Morton Ann; Mottron, Laurent			The level and nature of autistic intelligence	PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							ABILITY; INDIVIDUALS; PERSPECTIVE; CHILDREN; CORTEX; IQ	Autistics are presumed to be characterized by cognitive impairment, and their cognitive strengths (e.g., in Block Design performance) are frequently interpreted as low-level by-products of high-level deficits, not as direct manifestations of intelligence. Recent attempts to identify the neuroanatomical and neurofunctional signature of autism have been positioned on this universal, but untested, assumption. We therefore assessed a broad sample of 38 autistic children on the preeminent test of fluid intelligence, Raven's Progressive Matrices. Their scores were, on average, 30 percentile points, and in some cases more than 70 percentile points, higher than their scores on the Wechsler scales of intelligence. Typically developing control children showed no such discrepancy, and a similar contrast was observed when a sample of autistic adults was compared with a sample of nonautistic adults. We conclude that intelligence has been underestimated in autistics.

Schizophrenic patients treated with clozapine or olanzapine perform better on theory of mind tasks than those treated with risperidone or typical antipsychotic medications	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						schizophrenia; antipsychotics; atypical; typical; social cognition; theory of mind	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FOS EXPRESSION; HALOPERIDOL; PEOPLE; BRAIN; ATTRIBUTION; SYMPTOMATOLOGY; NEUROLEPTICS; DOPAMINE; CHILDREN	Theory of mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others, is associated with medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) activity and is impaired in schizophrenia. Olanzapine or clozapine but not typical antipsychotics or risperidone preferentially affect c-fos expression in mPFC in animals. We tested the hypothesis that schizophrenic patients treated with different antipsychotics would perform differently on ToM tasks. Groups receiving Typicals (n = 23), Clozapine (n = 18), Olanzapine (n = 20) or Risperidone (n = 23) and a Control group of healthy volunteers (n = 24) were matched for age, gender, handedness and education. ToM functioning was assessed with picture sequence, second-order belief and faux-pas tests. Schizophrenic groups performed similarly to controls on non-ToM conditions. The Olanzapine and Clozapine groups performed similarly to Controls on ToM tasks. The Typicals and Risperidone groups performed worse than the other groups on ToM tasks. We concluded that ToM performance of schizophrenic patients is influenced by the antipsychotic they are taking. Our results suggest that olanzapine or clozapine but not typicals or risperidone may improve or protect ToM ability. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Current knowledge about how nightmares are produced is stilt influenced by neo-psychoanalytic speculations as well as by more recent personality, evolutionary and neurobiological models. A majority of these models stipulate some type of emotionally adaptive function for dreaming, e.g., image contextualization, affect desomatization, mood regulation or fear extinction. Nightmares are widely seen to be either an intensified expression of an emotionally adaptive function or, conversely, as evidence of its breakdown. Our recent, affective network dysfunction (AND) model, integrates the tenets of many prior models in proposing that nightmares reflect problems with the fear extinction function of dreaming. This new model accounts for a wide range of dysphoric dream imagery (bad dreams, idiopathic nightmares, post-traumatic nightmares) and incorporates recent findings in the areas of brain imaging, steep physiology, PTSD, anxiety disorders and the consolidation and extinction of fear memories.

Although Rho GTPases have a significant role in many biological events, they are best known for their ability to restructure the actin cytoskeleton profoundly through the activation of specific downstream effectors. Two distinct families of GEFs for Rho GTPases have been reported so far, based on the features of their catalytic domains: firstly, the classical GEFs, which contain a DbI homology-pleckstrin homology domain module with GEF activity, and secondly, the Dock180-related GEFs, which contain a Dock homology region-2 domain that catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on Rho GTPases. Recent exciting data suggest key roles for the DHR-2 domain-containing GEFs in a wide variety of fundamentally important biological functions, including cell migration, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, myoblast fusion and neuronal polarization.

Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated in 46 rats allocated to receive: (1) Vehicle (before surgery) - Vehicle (after surgery); (2) Vehicle - WIN55,212-2; (3) WIN55,212-2 - Vehicle-, (4) WIN55,212-2-WIN55,212-2; (5) AM251+vehicle; (6) AM251+WIN55,212-2; (7) AM630+vehicle; (8) AM630+VVIN55,212-2; (9) Sham receiving vehicle; and (10) Sham receiving VVIN55,212-2. The decreased in mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia by WIN55,212-2 was significantly greater when it was administered during one week before surgery. In conclusion, pre-emptive use of cannabinoids produced greater antinociceptive effects in a model of neuropathic pain and this effect is mediated by cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors.

HIF2 alpha reduces growth rate but promotes angiogenesis in a mouse model of neuroblastoma	BMC CANCER			English	Article							HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR-1-ALPHA; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR PROTEIN; ENDOTHELIAL PAS DOMAIN; CELL-CYCLE ARREST; HIF-1-ALPHA; EXPRESSION; TRANSACTIVATION; HYPERTROPHY; HIF-2-ALPHA; INHIBITION	Background: HIF2 alpha/EPASI is a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor involved in catecholamine homeostasis, vascular remodelling, physiological angiogenesis and adipogenesis. It is overexpressed in many cancerous tissues, but its exact role in tumour progression remains to be clarified. Methods: In order to better establish its function in tumourigenesis and tumour angiogenesis, we have stably transfected mouse neuroblastoma NIE-115 cells with the native form of HIF2 alpha or with its dominant negative mutant, HIF2a (1 - 485) and studied their phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Results: In vitro studies reveal that HIF2a induces neuroblastoma cells hypertrophy and decreases their proliferation rate, while its inactivation by the HIF2a (1 - 485) mutant leads to a reduced cell size, associated with an accelerated proliferation. However, our in vivo experiments show that subcutaneous injection of cells overexpressing HIF2a into syngenic mice, leads to the formation of tumour nodules that grow slower than controls, but that are well structured and highly vascularized. In contrast, HIF2a (1 - 485)- expressing neuroblastomas grow fast, but are poorly vascularized and quickly tend to extended necrosis. Conclusion: Together, our data reveal an unexpected combination between an antiproliferative and a pro-angiogenic function of HIF2a that actually seems to be favourable to the establishment of neuroblastomas in vivo.

Peer-derived influences are not always positive, however. Here, we explore neural correlates of interindividual differences in the probability of resisting peer influence in early adolescence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found striking differences between 10-year-old children with high and low resistance to peer influence in their brain activity during observation of angry hand movements and angry facial expressions: compared with subjects with low resistance to peer influence, individuals with high resistance showed a highly coordinated brain activity in neural systems underlying perception of action and decision making. These findings suggest that the probability of resisting peer influence depends on neural interactions during observation of emotion-laden actions.

This program is critically dependent on MRFs that target downstream muscle-specific genes. We now report the expression of Pitx2 and Pitx3 transcription factors throughout muscle development. Pitx2 is first expressed in muscle progenitor cells of the dermomyotome and myotome. The onset of myoblast differentiation is concomitant with expression of Pitx3; its expression is maintained in all skeletal muscles while Pitx2 expression decreases thereafter. We have generated Pitx3 mutant mice and this deficiency does not significantly perturb muscle development but it is completely compensated by the maintenance of Pitx2 expression in all skeletal muscles. These experiments suggest that Pitx genes are important for myogenesis and that Pitx2 and Pitx3 may have partly redundant roles. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Most MBs develop sporadically in the cerebellum, but their incidence is highly elevated in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis coli. These patients carry germline mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene. APC is part of a multiprotein complex involved in the Writ signaling pathway that controls the stability of beta-catenin, the central effector in this cascade. Previous genetic studies in MBs have identified mutations in genes coding for P-catenin and its partners, APC and AXIN1, which cause activation of Wnt signaling. The pathway is negatively controlled by the tumor suppressor AXIN2 (Conductin), a scaffold protein of this signaling complex. To investigate whether alterations in AXIN2 may also be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic MBs, we performed a mutational screening of the AXIN2 gene in 116 MB biopsy samples and 11 MB cell lines using single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing analysis. One MB displayed a somatic, tumor-specific 2 bp insertion in exon 5, leading to carboxy-terminal truncation of the AXIN2 protein. This tumor biopsy showed nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin protein, indicating an activation of Writ signaling. In 2 further MB biopsies, mutations were identified in exon 5 (Glu408Lys) and exon 8 (Ser738Phe) of the AXIN2 gene, which are due to predicted germline mutations and rare polymorphisms. mRNA expression analysis in 22 MBs revealed reduced expression of AXIN2 mRNA compared to 8 fetal cerebellar tissues. Promoter hypermethylation could be ruled out as a major cause for transcriptional silencing by bisulfite sequencing. To study the functional role of AXIN2 in MBs, wild-type AXIN2 was overexpressed in MB cell lines in which the Wnt signaling pathway was activated by Wnt-3a. In this assay, AXIN2 inhibited Wnt signaling demonstrated in luciferase reporter assays. In contrast, overexpression of mutated AXIN2 with a deleted C-terminal DIX-domain resulted in an activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. These findings indicate that mutations of AXIN2 can lead to an oncogenic activation of the Wnt pathway in MBs. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Sexual dimorphism of brain developmental trajectories during childhood and adolescence	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							MRI DATA; TESTOSTERONE; MATURATION; PATTERNS; ABILITY; MATTER; MODEL	Human total brain size is consistently reported to be similar to 8-10% larger in males, although consensus on regionally specific differences is weak. Here, in the largest longitudinal pediatric neuroimaging study reported to date (829 scans from 387 subjects, ages 3 to 27 years), we demonstrate the importance of examining size-by-age trajectories of brain development rather than group averages across broad age ranges when assessing sexual dimorphism. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we found robust male/female differences in the shapes of trajectories with total cerebral volume peaking at age 10.5 in females and 14.5 in males. White matter increases throughout this 24-year period with males having a steeper rate of increase during adolescence. Both cortical and subcortical gray matter trajectories follow an inverted U shaped path with peak sizes I to 2 years earlier in females. These sexually dimorphic trajectories confirm the importance of longitudinal data in studies of brain development and underline the need to consider sex matching in studies of brain development.

We used this method to analyze the evolution of MTR in individual voxels of an acute, Gadolinium (Gd)enhancing lesion that was available for pathology. Over 6.5 months following enhancement, MTR was low and stable in the lesion center (81% of the initially Gd-enhancing lesion volume (GdLV)) and MTR increased at the lesion border with normal- appearing white matter (14%GdLV). The estimated error of these measurements was less than 1.8%GdLV based on scan/rescan analysis. Histopathological analysis confirmed a demyelinated lesion centre with diffuse presence of macrophages/microglia and marked loss of oligodendrocytes and a partially remyelinated lesion border with diffuse presence of macrophages/microglia and relatively more oligodendrocytes compared to the lesion centre. The correlation of imaging and histopathological findings support the validity and sensitivity of our method of voxel-based MTR image processing for monitoring demyelination and remyelination in vivo.

Although the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is thought to play a central role in error detection, little is known about the electrophysiological activity of this structure during the performance-monitoring process. We directly addressed this issue by training monkeys to perform a Stroop-like task and then recorded neuronal activity in the rostral cingulate motor area (CMAr), a relatively unexplored region of the ACC known to be involved in motor processing. We found that most CMAr neurons responded during the evaluation period to both positive and negative feedback, but neuronal changes were more important after an error than after a successful trial. Interestingly, this performance-monitoring activity was not directly modulated by the degree of difficulty of the cognitive situation because changes in discharge frequency were similar whatever the level of attentional control imposed on the monkey. Firing activity during the evaluation period increased more, however, in erroneously completed than in incompleted trials and when the reward was delivered in an active rather than passive context, indicating that performance evaluation was conditioned by the degree of commitment of the animal to the task. It would thus seem that CMAr neurons could constitute a system for the evaluation of behavioral performance contingent on the subject's commitment to the task.

This form facilitates quantum dynamics calculations. We show that it is possible to reduce the dimensionality of the component functions by introducing new and redundant coordinates obtained with linear transformations. The transformations are obtained from a neural network. Different coordinates are used for different component functions and the new coordinates are determined as the potential is fitted. The quality of the fits and the generality of the method are illustrated by fitting reference potential surfaces of hydrogen peroxide and of the reaction OH+H(2)-> H(2)O+H.

The present work investigated the AVP effect on endogenous opiate peptides, oxytocin (OXT) and classical neurotransmitters in the rat PAG. The results showed that AVP elevated the concentrations of leucine-enkephalin (L-Ek), methionine-enkephalin (M-Ek) and beta-endorphin ( beta-Ep), but did not change the concentrations of dynorphinA(1-13) (DynA(1-13)), OXT, classical neurotransmitters including achetylcholine (Ach), choline (Ch), serotonin (5-HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), and their metabolic products in PAG perfusion liquid. Pain stimulation increased the concentrations of AVP, L-EK, M-Ek, beta-Ep, 5-HT and 5-HIAA (5-HT metabolic product), but did not influence the concentrations of DynA(1-13), OXT, the other classical neurotransmitters and their metabolic products. PAG pretreatment with naloxone - an opiate receptor antagonist completely attenuated the pain threshold increase induced by PAG administration of AVP, but local pretreatment of OXT or classical neurotransmitter receptor antagonist did not influence the pain threshold increase induced by PAG administration of AVR The data suggested that AVP in PAG could induce the local release of enkephalin and endorphin rather than dynophin, OXT and classical neurotransmitters to participate in pain modulation.

Methylphenidate administration to juvenile rats alters brain areas involved in cognition, motivated behaviors, appetite, and stress	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Ritalin; prefrontal cortex; hippocampus; striatum; hypothalamus; ADHD	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DORSOMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING FACTOR; ROSTRAL VENTROLATERAL MEDULLA; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; DENTATE GYRUS; ULTRASTRUCTURAL-LOCALIZATION; ORAL METHYLPHENIDATE	Thousands of children receive methylphenidate (MPH; Ritalin) for attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet the long-term neurochemical consequences of MPH treatment are unknown. To mimic clinical Ritalin treatment in children, male rats were injected with MPH (5 mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily from postnatal day 7 (PND7)-PND35. At the end of administration (PND35) or in adulthood (PND135), brain sections from littermate pairs were immunocytochemically labeled for neurotransmitters and cytological markers in 16 regions implicated in MPH effects and/or ADHD etiology. At PND35, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats given MPH showed 55% greater immunoreactivity (-ir) for the catecholamine marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 60% more Nissl-stained cells, and 40% less norepinephrine transporter (NET)-ir density. In hippocampal dentate gyrus, MPH-receiving rats showed a 51% decrease in NET-ir density and a 61% expanded distribution of the new-cell marker PSA-NCAM (polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule). In medial striatum, TH-ir decreased by 21%, and in hypothalamus neuropeptide Y-ir increased by 10% in MPH-exposed rats. At PND135, MPH-exposed rats exhibited decreased anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and a trend for decreased TH-ir in the mPFC. Neither PND35 nor PND135 rats showed major structural differences with MPH exposure. These findings suggest that developmental exposure to high therapeutic doses of MPH has short-term effects on select neurotransmitters in brain regions involved in motivated behaviors, cognition, appetite, and stress. Although the observed neuroanatomical changes largely resolve with time, chronic modulation of young brains with MPH may exert effects on brain neurochemistry that modify some behaviors even in adulthood.

This could contribute to the persistence of DUI behaviour and influence the effectiveness of remedial interventions. The objectives of this study were to clarify the neurocognitive characteristics of DUI recidivists and the nature of potential impairments, and to explore relationships between these characteristics and the frequency of past DUI convictions. One hundred male recidivists were evaluated for visuospatial constructional abilities and visual memory, verbal fluency, attention skills, cognitive flexibility, spatial planning, and verbal and movement inhibition. Results indicated that a majority of recidivists showed signs of neurocognitive impairment on several dimensions. Impairment was most marked on visuospatial constructional abilities and visual memory. In contrast to previous studies, no participants were found to have impulse control problems. Measures of memory and cognitive efficiency were significantly associated with the frequency of past convictions. Finally, exploratory analyses of two potential sources of impairment, alcohol exposure and head trauma, suggested the role of excessive alcohol use as the most obvious associated factor. Overall, the findings indicate that neurocognitive impairments are a common feature in recidivists and may contribute to DUI persistence. Development of a DUI-specific neurocognitive assessment and greater understanding of how neurocognitive status influences DUI risk could lead to remediation strategies better adapted to the individual characteristics of recidivists.

Method: Patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous firings of DA and GABAergic neurons in the VTA in acute midbrain slices from rats. Results: Ethanol (20-80 mM) excites DA neurons, and more potently depresses firing of local GABAergic neurons. The ethanol-induced excitation of DA neurons is considerably attenuated by DAMGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N-Me-Phe-Gly-ol enkephalin), a mu-opioid agonist that suppresses firing of GABAergic neurons, or by naloxone, a general opioid antagonist. The ongoing opioid-induced facilitation of DA cell firing (revealed by naloxone) is enhanced by ethanol, probably by an increase in opioid release or action. Conclusion: Ethanol excites VTA DA neurons at least partly by increasing ongoing opioid-mediated suppression of local GABAergic inhibition. This indirect mechanism may contribute significantly to the positively reinforcing properties of ethanol.

The adaptation of the cardiac hormonal systems oxytocin (OT), natriuretic peptides (NPs), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in response to exercise training was investigated in intact and ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Ovariectomy significantly augmented body weight (BW), left ventricle (LV) mass, and intra-abdominal fat pad weight and decreased the expression of oxytocin receptor (OTR), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A), in the right atrium (RA) and LV, indieating estrogenic control of these genes. These effects of ovariectomy were Counteracted by 8-wk-long exercise training which decreased fat pad weight (33.4 +/- 2.3 to 23.4 +/- 3.1 g, n = 8, P < 0.05), plasma free fatty acids (0.124 +/- 0.033 to 0.057 +/- 0.010 mM, n = 8, P < 0.01), and plasma triacylglycerol (0.978 +/- 0.174 to 0.588 +/- 0.115 mM, n = 8, P < 0.05). Chronic exercise tended to decrease BW and stimulated ANP (4- to 5-fold) and OTR gene expression in the LV and RA and BNP and inducible NOS (iNOS) mRNA in the LV. In sham-operated rats, exercise augmented ANP expression in the RA, downregulated GC-A mRNA in the LV and RA, but increased its expression threefold in the RA of OVX animals. Endothelial NOS and iNOS expression was enhanced in the left atrium of sham-operated rats.

Right mediastinal nerve stimulation typically caused sinus slowing, atrial tachycardia (AT), followed by atrial fibrillation (AF). Activation maps during AT showed epicardial breakthroughs from the right atrial free wall or Bachmann's bundle. Left mediastinal nerve stimulation (LMN) rarely caused sinus slowing and ATs originated mostly from Bachmann's bundle or from the pulmonary vein ostial region. Atrial repolarization changes induced by neural stimulation were measured by integrating the area subtended by 161 epicardial unipolar electrograms. Atrial tachycardia epicardial breakthrough sites were closely associated with the border zone where repolarization changes occurred. Both AT and AF were abolished by I.V. atropine, as were sinus bradycardia and atrial repolarization effects of nerve stimulation. Shortening of latency of onset and duration of AT by I.V. timolol suggest concurrent activation of adrenergic efferent neurons. In conclusion, juxta-cardiac mediastinal nerve stimulation can induce atrial fibrillation from multiple, discrete right and left atrial sites, which correspond to localized repolarization changes. Secondly, sinus bradycardia is not a necessary index of parasympathetic neurally induced atrial fibrillation.	[Nadeau, Reginald; Cardinal, Rene; Armour, J.

Clinical and genetic study of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 1	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MUTATIONS; FORM	Objective: Define the phenotype and genotype of a cluster of families with a relatively pure cerebellar ataxia referred to as autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ARCA-1). Methods: We ascertained 64 probands and affected members of 30 French-Canadian families all showing similar clinical features and originating from the same region of Quebec. After informed consent, we performed detailed clinical history, neurological examination, brain imaging, nerve conduction studies, and SYNE1 mutation detection of all available subjects. Results: Based on the cases examined, ARCA-1 is a cerebellar syndrome characterized by recessive transmission, middle-age onset (mean, 31.60; range, 17-46 years), slow progression and moderate disability, significant dysarthria, mild oculomotor abnormalities, occasional brisk reflexes in the lower extremities, normal nerve conduction studies, and diffuse cerebellar atrophy on imaging. We identified a total of seven mutations in our population, thereby providing evidence of genotypic heterogeneity. Patients with different mutations did not show significant phenotypic heterogeneity. Interpretation: We identified a cluster of French-Canadian families with a new recessive ataxia of relatively pure cerebellar type caused by mutations in SYNE1 The function of SYNE1 is thus critical in the maintenance of cerebellar structure in humans. We expect that this disease will be a common cause of middle-age-onset recessive ataxia worldwide.

Nonpsychotic siblings of COS probands could help evaluate whether the cortical GM abnormalities are familial/trait markers. Objective: To map cortical development in nonpsychotic siblings of COS probands. Design: Using an automated measurement and prospectively acquired anatomical brain magnetic resonance images, we mapped cortical GM thickness in healthy full siblings (n = 52, 113 scans; age 8 through 28 years) of patients with COS, contrasting them with age-, sex-, and scan interval-matched healthy controls (n = 52, 108 scans). The false-discovery rate procedure was used to control for type I errors due to multiple comparisons. Setting: An ongoing COS study at the National Institute of Mental Health. Participants: Fifty-two healthy full siblings of patients with COS, aged 8 through 28 years, and 52 healthy controls. Main Outcome Measures: Longitudinal trajectories of cortical GM development in healthy siblings of patients with COS compared with matched healthy controls and exploratory measure of the relationship between developmental GM trajectories and the overall functioning as defined by the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) score. Results: Younger, healthy siblings of patients with COS showed significant GM deficits in the left prefrontal and bilateral temporal cortices and smaller deficits in the right prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices compared with the controls. These cortical deficits in siblings disappeared by age 20 years and the process of deficit reduction correlated with overall functioning (GAS scores) at the last scan. Conclusions: Prefrontal and temporal GM loss in COS appears to be a familial/trait marker. Amelioration of regional GM deficits in healthy siblings was associated with higher global functioning ( GAS scores), suggesting a relationship between brain plasticity and functional outcome for these nonpsychotic, nonspectrum siblings.

Genetic factors may partly explain this difference. We investigated whether variation at the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) gene and its 5' upstream region may predispose to suicide in major depressive disorder (MDD) and whether this predisposition is mediated by impulsive-aggressive behaviors OAK. Methods: We genotyped 14 single nucleoticle polymorphisms (SNPs) in 259 depressed subjects, 114 of which committed suicide while depressed. Phenotypic assessments were carried out by means of proxy-based interviews. Single-marker and haplotype association analyses were conducted. Differences in behavioral and personality traits according to genotypic variation were investigated, as well as genetic and clinical predictors of suicide. Results: We found two upstream and two intronic SNPs associated with suicide. No direct effect of these variants was observed on IABs. However, a slight association with reward dependence scores was found. Controlling for suicide risk factors, two SNPs (rs4448731 and rs4641527) significantly predicted suicide, along with cluster B personality disorders and family history of suicide. Conclusions: The TPH2 gene and its 5' upstream region variants may be involved in the predisposition to suicide in MDD; however, our findings do not support the role of IABs as mediators.

A servomechanism model has been proposed to explain the pattern and time-course of axonal growth between these two regions [Honda, H., 1998. Topographic mapping in the retinotectal projection by means of complementary ligand and receptor gradients: a computer simulation study. J. Theor. Biol., 192, 235-246]. Here, we show that a modification of this model incorporating a different criterion for axonal decision-making, called the local optimum rule, is guaranteed to converge to a topographic map under a wide range of conditions encountered during neural development. A theoretical investigation of these conditions leads to new hypotheses regarding map formation. 0 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: After Research Ethics Board approval, data were collected from the charts of all patients who underwent a craniotomy at our institution between January 2004 and December 2005. The severity of post-craniotomy pain was assessed by collecting scores obtained using an 11-point verbal rating scale and calculating the cumulative analgesic requirements for the first 48 hr postoperatively. Data were compared according to the craniotomy location. Results: Data from 299 patients was available for analysis. On average, 76% of patients experienced moderate to severe postoperative pain. Frontal craniotomy was associated with lower pain scores than four of six craniotomy sites analyzed, with 49% of patients reporting mild pain, a significant difference (P < 0.05) compared with all other groups except for parietal craniotomies. Frontal craniotomy patients also had lower opioid analgesic requirements compared to patients who underwent posterior fossa craniotomy (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that craniotomy location (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.004) were both independent predictors of the intensity of postoperative pain, with lower pain scores as age increased. Postoperative use of steroids, gender and presence of preoperative pain were not statistically linked to postoperative pain intensity. The prevalence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was 56% and it did not vary according to the location of craniotomy. Conclusion: This study shows that the intensity of postoperative pain in neurosurgery is affected by the site of craniotomy. Frontal craniotomy patients experienced the lowest pain scores, and required significantly less opioid than patients undergoing posterior fossa interventions.

Here we investigate the brain electrical phenomena underlying such a function by using a combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging. We recorded MEG-evoked responses in 9 healthy human subjects while they discriminated the direction of a transient change in a translationally moving random dot pattern presented either to the right or to the left of a central fixation point. We found that responses reached their maximum in 2 main regions corresponding to motion processing area middle temporal (MT)/V5 contralateral to the stimulated visual field, and to the right inferior parietal lobe (rIPL). The activation latencies were very similar in both regions (similar to 135 ms) following the direction change onset. Our findings suggest that area MT/V5 provides the strongest sensory signal in response to changes in the direction of translational motion, whereas area rIPL may be involved either in the sensory processing of transient motion signals or in the processing of signals related to orienting of attention.

In addition, they strongly regulate cortical development by modulating several cellular processes such as neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiation and connectivity. Not surprisingly, aberrant development of GABAergic circuits has been implicated in many neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia, autism and Tourette's syndrome. Unfortunately, efforts directed towards the comprehension of the mechanisms regulating GABAergic circuits formation and function have been impaired by the strikingly heterogeneity, both at the morphological and functional level, of GABAergic interneurons. Recent technical advances, including the improvement of interneurons-specific labelling techniques, have started to reveal the basic principles underlying this process. This review summarizes recent findings on the mechanisms underlying the construction of GABAergic circuits in the cortex, with a particular focus on potential implications for brain diseases with neurodevelopmental origin.

Improved memory function is associated with a better functional outcome. Some clinical trials have used add-on therapy with acetylcholine sterase inhibitors (AChEIs) to test the cognitive enhancement effect of this kind of medication, which is usually prescribed for other indications than schizophrenia. Objective: To perform a systematic review with meta-analysis. Methods: Studies were identified using electronic search engines, hand searches, cross-referencing of studies, and contacts with investigators. Eligible studies were those comparing cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia before and after AChEI treatment, randomized controlled trials, and crossover and open trials of AChEI in people with schizophrenia, with trial duration of more than 2 weeks. Validated neurocognitive measures and computerized batteries were used to corroborate the effect. Results: Our findings reveal a small to medium improvement in short-term memory and long-term memory (LTM) performance when patients are compared with the baseline performance, but when compared with controls (placebo treatment) at the end of the trial, they performed worse on both short-term memory and on LTM. However, the effects were nonsignificant. The LTM magnitude estimate demonstrating a treatment effect between the start and end points of the trial consisted of 8 studies (before treatment, n = 209; overall attrition rate, 8%). The effect estimate was significant and close to heterogeneous. Duration of trial increases the effect estimate slightly. The analysis was broken down by AChEI: 5 studies of donepezil (effect size [ES], -0.352), 2 studies of rivastigmine (ES, 0.383), and I study of galantamine. There were 6 studies of AChEI added to second-generation antipsychotics (ES, 0.424) and 2 studies of first-generation antipsychoties (ES, 0.207). Conclusions: Notwithstanding an extensive investigation, eligible data for the meta-analysis were nominal. To date, and overall, our quantitative systematic review provides no clear evidence on whether AChEls should be prescribed for memory enhancement in patients with schizophrenia.

CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						age; OSAS; waking quantitative EEG; daytime performance	POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; BREATHING DISORDERS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ELDERLY SUBJECTS; NORMAL ADULTS; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether EEG slowing is more pronounced in older than younger OSAS patients and to verify whether this cortical slowing is correlated to daytime performance, respiratory perturbation and sleep fragmentation. Methods: Twelve young OSAS patients (mean age 38.2 +/- 2.0 y) and 13 older OSAS patients (mean age 62.2 +/- 1.9 y) along with 13 young controls (mean age 35.8 +/- 2.0 y) and 14 older controls (mean age 60.2 +/- 2.0 y) underwent a polysomnographic evaluation followed by a waking EEG recording. As a global index of cortical slowing, a ratio of slow-to-fast frequencies was calculated in all cortical regions. Daytime performance was assessed using the four choice reaction time test. Results: Differences in waking EEG and in daytime performance were analyzed by ANOVAs with Group and Age as factors. Waking EEG did not yield a Group by Age interaction. OSAS patients had higher ratios across all regions than controls. Similarly, daytime performance revealed no Group by Age interaction. However, OSAS patients showed more lapses than controls and older subjects were slower than younger subjects. Conclusions: Our results indicate that age does not interact with OSAS to worsen the severity of cortical slowing, but age can add to the OSAS effect to worsen daytime performance deficits in OSAS patients. Significance: The daytime performance deficits observed particularly in elderly OSAS patients warrant a careful clinical assessment of these patients to prevent accidents and injuries.

The spinal cord dura mater reaction to nitinol and titanium alloy particles: a 1-year study in rabbits	EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						spinal cord; nitinol; titanium; biocompatibility; intervertebral fusion device	LUMBAR INTERBODY FUSION; IN-VITRO BIOCOMPATIBILITY; DONOR-SITE MORBIDITY; SHAPE-MEMORY METAL; CREST BONE-GRAFT; NICKEL-TITANIUM; INTERVERTEBRAL FUSION; STAINLESS-STEEL; SHEEP MODEL; SOFT-TISSUE	This investigation was undertaken to simulate in an animal model the particles released from a porous nitinol interbody fusion device and to evaluate its consequences on the dura mater, spinal cord and nerve roots, lymph nodes (abdominal para-aortic), and organs (kidneys, spleen, pancreas, liver, and lungs). Our objective was to evaluate the compatibility of the nitinol particles with the dura mater in comparison with titanium alloy. In spite of the great use of metallic devices in spine surgery, the proximity of the spinal cord to the devices raised concerns about the effect of the metal debris that might be released onto the neural tissue. Forty-five New Zealand white female rabbits were divided into three groups: nitinol (treated: N = 4 per implantation period), titanium (treated: N = 4 per implantation period), and sham rabbits (control: N = 1 per observation period). The nitinol and titanium alloy particles were implanted in the spinal canal on the dura mater at the lumbar level L2-L3. The rabbits were sacrificed at 1, 4, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. Histologic sections from the regional lymph nodes, organs, from remote and implantation sites, were analyzed for any abnormalities and inflammation. Regardless of the implantation time, both nitinol and titanium particles remained at the implantation site and clung to the spinal cord lining soft tissue of the dura mater. The inflammation was limited to the epidural space around the particles and then reduced from acute to mild chronic during the follow-up. The dura mater, sub-dural space, nerve roots, and the spinal cord were free of reaction. No particles or abnormalities were found either in the lymph nodes or in the organs. In contact with the dura, the nitinol elicits an inflammatory response similar to that of titanium. The tolerance of nitinol by a sensitive tissue such as the dura mater during the span of 1 year of implantation demonstrated the safety of nitinol and its potential use as an intervertebral fusion device.

Threshold position control of arm movement with anticipatory increase in grip force	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						motor control; referent arm-hand configuration; threshold aperture; anticipatory actions; computer simulations	PRECISION GRIP; MOTOR CONTROL; STRETCH REFLEX; REFERENT CONFIGURATION; MULTIMUSCLE CONTROL; BILATERAL DEFICIT; POSTURAL CONTROL; DECEREBRATE CAT; FINGERTIP PULP; MODEL	The grip force holding an object between fingers usually increases before or simultaneously with arm movement thus preventing the object from sliding. We experimentally analyzed and simulated this anticipatory behavior based on the following notions. (1) To move the arm to a new position, the nervous system shifts the threshold position at which arm muscles begin to be recruited. Deviated from their activation thresholds, arm muscles generate activity and forces that tend to minimize this deviation by bringing the arm to a new position. (2) To produce a grip force, with or without arm motion, the nervous system changes the threshold configuration of the hand. This process defines a threshold (referent) aperture (R-a) of appropriate fingers. The actual aperture (Q(a)) is constrained by the size of the object held between the fingers whereas, in referent position R-a, the fingers virtually penetrate the object. Deviated by the object from their thresholds of activation, hand muscles generate activity and grip forces in proportion to the gap between the Q(a) and R-a. Thus, grip force emerges since the object prevents the fingers from reaching the referent position. (3) From previous experiences, the system knows that objects tend to slide off the fingers when arm movements are made and, to prevent sliding, it starts narrowing the referent aperture simultaneously with or somewhat before the onset of changes in the referent arm position. (4) The interaction between the fingers and the object is accomplished via the elastic pads on the tips of fingers. The pads are compressed not only due to the grip force but also due to the tangential inertial force ("load") acting from the object on the pads along the arm trajectory. Compressed by the load force, the pads move back and forth in the gap between the finger bones and object, thus inevitably changing the normal component of the grip force, in synchrony with and in proportion to the load force. Based on these notions, we simulated experimental elbow movements and grip forces when subjects rapidly changed the elbow angle while holding an object between the index finger and the thumb. It is concluded that the anticipatory increase in the grip force with or without correlation with the tangential load during arm motion can be explained in neurophysiological and biomechanical terms without relying on programming of grip force based on an internal model.

Consolidation of object-discrimination memory is independent of the hippocampus in rats	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						retrograde amnesia; temporal gradient; familiarity; neurotoxic lesion	REMOTE SPATIAL MEMORY; RETROGRADE-AMNESIA; UNCONDITIONAL STIMULI; RECOGNITION MEMORY; NONSPATIAL MEMORY; LESIONS; DAMAGE; ANTEROGRADE; FEAR; RECOLLECTION	We examined whether retrograde amnesia would be more likely for object discriminations learned an hour before hippocampal damage than object discriminations learned days before. Specifically, rats were trained on two object-discrimination problems 72 h before surgery and another discrimination problem and the reversal of one of the previously learned problems 1 h before surgery. Importantly, novel procedures that minimized overtraining on the object discriminations were used to increase the possibility of the lesions causing amnesia. After either receiving sham or neurotoxic-induced hippocampal damage, rats were tested for retention using an extinction procedure. Control rats and rats with extensive hippocampal damage displayed a strong bias for the rewarded object on each object-discrimination problem and a significant bias for the most recent contingency learned on the reversal problem. These results suggest that, despite the use of very sensitive training and testing procedures, hippocampal damage did not cause retrograde amnesia. The findings imply that the hippocampus is not critical for the consolidation, storage, or retrieval of object-reward associations, or any other information required for accurate performance of an object discrimination.

Sex hormones and heat shock proteins (Hsps) participate in these responses to stress. Their regulation is disturbed in aging. We assessed the expression of Hsps in hippocampus and cortex of follitropin receptor knockout (FORKO) mice, known to exhibit gender and age-dependent imbalance in sex steroids and gonadotropins. These imbalances could contribute to an impaired regulation of Hsps thereby increasing the risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders. Our study shows that, in the hippocampus the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp25 was reduced in 20-month-old FORKO mice. However, in the cortex both Hsps were significantly down regulated only in elderly females. There is a well-established co-regulation between Hsps and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Significant, gender-specific impairments in the translocation of phosphorylated ERK and JNK were found in the CNS structures in aged FORKO mice. Our results suggest that hormonal imbalances lead to a disturbed subcellular distribution of activated MAPKs which contribute to the impairments of signal transduction networks maintaining normal physiological functions in the cortex and hippocampus that are associated with neurodegenerative changes in aging.

Similar to most proteinases synthesized first as zymogens, PC1/3 is synthesized as a larger precursor that undergoes proteolytic processing of its signal peptide and propeptide. The N-terminally located propeptide has been shown to be essential for folding and self-inhibition. Furthermore, PC1/3 also possesses a C-terminal region (CT-peptide) which, for maximal enzymatic activity, must also be cleaved. To date, its role has been documented through transfection studies in terms of sorting and targeting of PC1/3 and chimeric proteins into secretory granules. In this study, we examined the properties of a 135-residue purified bacterially produced CT-peptide on the in vitro enzymatic activity of PC1/3. Depending on the amount of CT-peptide used, it is shown that the CT-peptide increases PC1/3 activity at low concentrations (nM) and decreases it at high concentrations (mu M), a feature typical of an activator. Furthermore, we show that, contrary to the propeptide, the CT-peptide is not further cleaved by PC1/3 although it is sensitive to human furin activity. Based on these results, it is proposed that PC1/3, through its various domains, is capable of controlling its enzymatic activity in all regions of the cell that it encounters. This mode of self-control is unique among members of all proteinases families.

J	Zatorre, RJ				Zatorre, Robert J.			There's more to auditory cortex than meets the ear	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Auditory Cortex - Listening Brain	SEP, 2006	Nottingham, ENGLAND	MIC inst Hearing Res		functional neuroimaging	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; MUSICAL IMAGERY; VISUAL EVENTS; MODULATION; PLASTICITY; MEMORY; BRAIN; EXPERIENCE; STIMULI	The auditory cortex is typically defined as that portion of the cortex containing neurons that respond to sound. This definition is adequate in a narrow context, but does not take into account sufficiently the subtleties associated with more complex behaviors and cognitive processes. Thus, it is easy to demonstrate that cortical regions essentially unrelated to sound processing may nevertheless be activated by an auditory stimulus; conversely, it is possible to demonstrate responses within classical auditory cortical regions in the complete absence of sound. We give several examples that indicate that responses in auditory cortex cannot be predicted based solely on knowledge of stimulus features. Rather, factors such as memory, attention, and mental imagery can be shown to play a major role in modulating or producing neural responses within auditory cortex. We argue that the interactions between classically defined auditory regions and other sensory, motor, and cognitive systems underlie many behaviors of interest; and that a more complete understanding of these processes will emerge from a consideration of the distributed nature of auditory cortical function.

In most related studies, the NCOBSs have been accepted as stable without further consideration. To investigate the stabilities of NCOBSs associated with the auditory, motor, and visual cortices, we evaluated the negative correlation maps of each brain region under different "task-backgrounds" within the same subject-group, as well as within different subject-groups during a conscious resting state. These "task-backgrounds" refer to tasks not expected to activate the specific ROI under consideration and are in some sense analogous to "resting states." We found that the negative correlation maps of the motor and visual cortices were quite variable between either different task-backgrounds or different subject-groups, whereas those of the auditory cortex exhibited some similarities. These results indicate that the NCOBSs associated with the motor and visual cortices were unstable both under task-backgrounds and during the conscious resting state. The auditory cortex tended to have stable NCOBSs during these "resting states" (but scanner noise could make the auditory cortex "less resting"). This study highlights the importance of paying attention to the influence of the stabilities of NCOBSs in related studies and establishes the need for further studies on NCOBSs.

Ten healthy young men (Age: 21.7 +/- 2.2 years; Height: 179.2 +/- 6.9cm; Mass 72.7 +/- 11.1 kg) completed an incremental test and a 60 degrees tilt test during which R-R intervals were recorded before (TO) and after (T12) 12 weeks of intensive training, and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of training cessation (D2, D4 and D8, respectively). HRV was computed in time and frequency domains. Training resulted in a significant increase in estimated VO(2max) after T12 (p < 0.01), followed by a significant decrease during D2 and D8 (p < 0.05). Total power (LF + HF) and low frequency power (LF) increased significantly in the supine position after the training period (p < 0.05) and decreased moderately after D2 (p > 0.05) to stabilize afterwards. LF + HF and LIF were not different from TO at D8 (p > 0.05). It was concluded that eight weeks of training cessation allow to reverse the cardiovascular autonomic adaptations induced by 12 weeks of intensive training in healthy young men.

A total of 30 highly educated and healthy participants aged between 21 and 33 years were placed in one of three blurred vision groups, defined by their maximal visual acuity (20/20 or control group, 20/40, and 20/60). Blurred vision was simulated using positive diopters at a distance of 40 cm, the same distance as that at which tests were administered. Each participant was then assessed on a predetermined battery of nonverbal and verbal neuropsychological tests demanding different levels of acuity for optimal performance (i.e., tests whose items varied in terms of size and spatial frequency characteristics). In general, blurred vision significantly affected performance on nonverbal tests defined by small-sized/high-spatial-frequency items to a greater extent than on tests defined by larger sized/lower spatial-frequency items. As expected, blurred vision did not affect verbal test performance (Similarities, Information, and Arithmetic WAIS subtests). Our results are a clear indication of how even a "minimal" loss of visual acuity (20/40) can have a significant effect on the performance for certain nonverbal tests. In conclusion, such inferior performance is hypothetically interpretable as reflecting impaired cognitive functioning (i.e., attentional) targeted by a specific task (i.e., visual search) and suggests that the precision of the cognitive assessment and subsequent diagnosis are significantly biased when visuo-sensory abilities are not optimal, particularly for older patient populations where blurred vision resulting from correctable visual impairment is quite common.

Although the Sources of the N400 response have been identified in the left (and right) temporal lobe, the neural signatures of the I-AN and P600 have not been revealed. The present study used magnetoencephalography to localize sources of Syntactic and semantic activation in Finnish sentence reading. Participants were presented with sentences that ended in normally inflected nouns, nouns in an unacceptable case, verbs instead of nouns, or nouns that were correctly inflected but made no sense in the context. Around 400 msec, semantically anomalous last words evoked strong activation in the left superior temporal lobe with significant activation also for word class errors (N400). Weaker activation was seen for the semantic errors in the right hemisphere. Later, 600-800 msec after word onset, the strongest activation was seen to word class and morphosyntactic errors (P600). Activation was significantly weaker to semantically anomalous and correct words. The P600 syntactic activation was localized to bilateral sources in the temporal lobe, posterior to the N400 sources. The results suggest that the same general region Of the superior temporal cortex gives rise to both I-AN and N400 with bilateral reactivity to semantic manipulation and a left hemisphere effect to syntactic manipulation. The bilateral P600 response was sensitive to syntactic but not semantic factors.

The question if the GABA distribution is similar throughout the vertebrate subphylum is therefore still to be addressed. We here investigate two lamprey species, the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, and the river lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis, and compare the GABA pattern with that of other vertebrates. The present immunolustochemical study provides an anatomical basis for the general distribution and precise localization of GABAergic neurons in the adult lamprey forebrain and brainstem. GABA-immunoreactive cells were organized in a virtually identical manner in the two species. They were found throughout the brain, with the following regions being of particular interest: the granular cell layer of the olfactory bulb, the nucleus of the anterior commissure, the septum, the lateral and medial pallia, the striatum, the nucleus of the postoptic commissure, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and pretectal areas, the optic tectum, the torus semicircularis, the mesencephalic tegmentum, restricted regions of the rhombencephalic tegmentum, the octavolateral area, and the dorsal column nucleus. The GABA distribution found in cyclostomes is very similar to that of other classes of vertebrates, including mammals. Since the lamprey diverged from the main vertebrate line around 450 million years ago, this implies that already at that time the basic vertebrate plan for the GABA innervation in different parts of the brain had been developed.

We have combined three experimental approaches to identify the target genes that are underlying this phenomenon: 1) a microarray analysis of gene expression to identify hormone responsive genes in the cerebellum of Pax8(-/-) mice, a transgenic mouse model of congenital hypothyroidism; 2) a similar microarray analysis on primary culture of cerebellum neurons; and 3) a bioinformatics screen of conserved putative-binding sites in the mouse genome. This identifies surprisingly a small set of target genes, which, for some of them, might be key regulators of cerebellum development and neuronal differentiation.

Except for the testicular PC4, all the other convertases are expressed in brain and peripheral organs and play a critical role in various functions including the production of diverse neuropeptides as well as growth factors and receptors, the regulation of cellular adhesion/migration, cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis, and growth/differentiation of progenitor cells. Some of these convertases process proteins that are implicated in pathologies, including cancer malignancies, tissue regeneration, and viral infections. The implication of some of these convertases in sterol/lipid metabolism has only recently been appreciated. SKI-1/SIP activates the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids as well as the LDL receptor (LDLR), whereas PCSK9 inactivates the LDLR. Moreover, furin, PC5 and/or, PACE4 inactivates endothelial and lipoprotein lipases. Humans and mice exhibiting either a gain or loss of function of PCSK9 through specific point mutations or knockouts develop hypercholesterolemia and hypocholesterolemia phenotypes, respectively. A PCSK9 inhibitor in combination with statins offers a most promising therapeutic target to treat cardiovascular disorders including dyslipidemias. Specific inhibitors/modulators of the other PCs should find novel therapeutic applications in the control of PC-regulated pathologies.

Eighty healthy individuals participated in this study. Participants were divided into two groups: the older group included participants between 50 and 65 years old whereas the younger group included participants between 20 and 30 years old. Participants performed a semantic pairing task involving metaphorical and non -metaphorical alternative meanings of words and a countdown task. There were two different task presentation conditions: (1) non-interfering context task in which participants completed the main task (word-triad task) without any interference, and (2) interfering-context task in which the word-triad task and the countdown task were executed simultaneously. The main results indicated an age-related change in the processing of the non-literal alternative meanings of words. The most interesting result was that the resource-limiting condition had an impact only on the young adult group. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Next comes an analysis of the three most popular philosophies of mind: classical mind-body dualism, computerism, and psychoneural monism. It is argued that the latter, held by medical psychologists since Hippocrates, and formulated explicitly by Cajal and Hebb, is the philosophy of mind that underlies contemporary cognitive and affective neuroscience. The standard objections to psychoneural monism (or materialism) are examined. Evolutionary psychology, though promissory, is judged to be more fancy than fact at its present stage. The conclusion is that the philosophy of mind is still in a poor shape, but that it can advance if it learns more from the science of mind. It would also help if scientific psychologists were to replace such tacitly dualistic expressions as "organ N instantiates (or subserves) mental function W with "organ N performs mental function M", just as we say "the legs walk" instead of "walking is subserved by legs," and "the lungs breathe" instead of "the lungs instantiate breathing."

Microinjection and electroporation of embryonic kidney explants: An improved method	KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						kidney development; electroporation; organ culture	DNA ELECTROTRANSFER; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; MORPHOGENESIS; PERMEABILIZATION; EXPRESSION; BUD	Embryonic kidney explants are routinely used to study the molecular regulation of kidney development. One of the major technical challenges has been the need to express transgenes at high levels for prolonged periods of time. Existing protocols derived from work with the chick have used microinjection and electroporation with low voltage and long pulse time. In this study, we show that a high voltage with a short pulse time is preferable for mouse kidney explants. Using these conditions, gene expression is enhanced 10-fold over a 96-h period in culture with minimal toxicity. Furthermore, by modifying the site of microinjection, the ureteric bud or the metanephric mesenchyme can be targeted. We suggest that our described conditions will make microinjection and electroporation a more effective method to study gene function in the developing mouse kidney.

The well-known right visual field advantage in word recognition in divided visual field tasks is affected by both intra- and inter-individual variables. For example, hemispheric linguistic abilities may vary within a given individual according to the language component being processed, whereas variations between individuals may be modulated by the individual's handedness and gender. The objective of this divided visual field study was to compare gender differences in right- and left-handers in relation to their hemispheric abilities in performing phonological and semantic tasks. The results indicate that for both types of processing, gender had a different impact on right- and left-handed groups. Unexpectedly, a gender difference in laterality pattern was found in left-handers but not in right-handers for both phonological and semantic abilities. Intriguingly, left-handed men displayed a more symmetrical laterality pattern in phonological and semantic abilities than left-handed women.

The initial studies, using positron emission tomography, yielded results in keeping with the hypothesis that symptoms result from excessive cortical inhibition from cortico-striatal loops. However, subsequent studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that specific aspects of the paradigms used, such as the need to pay attention to one's movements, have a significant impact on activation patterns, which may complicate the interpretation of results. Functional neuroimaging has also been used to investigate the causes of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. While some studies implicate dopamine loss in striatum, more recent investigations using anatomical MRI to measure cortical atrophy suggest that some cognitive deficits are attributable to direct cortical involvement by the disease.

The goal of this study was to identify new molecular targets associated with suicide and with major depression using oligonucleotide microarrays in the limbic system ( amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate gryus (BA24) and posterior cingulate gyrus (BA29)). A total of 39 subjects were included in this study. They were all male subjects and comprised 26 suicides ( depressed suicides = 18, non depressed suicides = 8) and 13 matched controls. Brain gene expression analysis was carried out on human brain samples using the Affymetrix HG U133 chip set. Differential expression in each of the limbic regions showed group-specific patterns of expression, supporting particular neurobiological mechanisms implicated in suicide and depression. Confirmation of genes selected based on their significance and the interest of their function with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed consistently correlated signals with the results obtained in the microarray analysis. Gene ontology analysis with differentially expressed genes revealed an over-representation of transcription and metabolism-related genes in the hippocampus and amygdala, whereas differentially expressed genes in BA24 and BA29 were more generally related to RNA-binding, regulation of enzymatic activity and protein metabolism. Limbic expression patterns were most extensively altered in the hippocampus, where processes related to major depression were associated with altered expression of factors involved with transcription and cellular metabolism. Additionally, our results confirm previous evidence pointing to global alteration of gabaergic neurotransmission in suicide and major depression, offering new avenues in the study and possibly treatment of such complex disorders. Overall, these data suggest that specific patterns of expression in the limbic system contribute to the etiology of depression and suicidal behaviors and highlight the role of the hippocampus in major depression.

Unlike most other sensory-motor activities, music performance requires precise timing of several hierarchically organized actions, as well as precise control over pitch interval production, implemented through diverse effectors according to the instrument involved. We review the cognitive neuroscience literature of both motor and auditory domains, highlighting the value of studying interactions between these systems in a musical context, and propose some ideas concerning the role of the premotor cortex in integration of higher order features of music with appropriately timed and organized actions.

After the inducement in vitro, the ES cell-derived cells expressed Nestin and MAP-2, rather than GFAP mRNA. After transplantation, ES cell-derived cells can survive, migrate into the injury site, and specifically differentiate into neurons, showing improvement of the learning ability and memory of the HIE mouse at 8 months post-transplantation. The non-grafted HIE mouse brain showed typical patholo gical changes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where the number of neurons was reduced, while in the cell graft group, number of the neurons increased in the same regions. Although further study is necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms responsible for this functional recovery, we believe that ES cells have advantages for use as a donor source in HIE.

While these microstructurally defined maps have already been successfully used in the analysis of somatosensory, motor or language functions, several conceptual issues in the analysis of structure-function relationships still demand further clarification. In this paper, we demonstrate the principle approaches for anatomical localisation of functional activations based on probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps by exemplary analysis of an anterior parietal activation evoked by visual presentation of hand gestures. After consideration of the conceptual basis and implementation of volume or local maxima labelling, we comment on some potential interpretational difficulties, limitations and caveats that could be encountered. Extending and supplementing these methods, we then propose a supplementary approach for quantification of structure-function correspondences based on distribution analysis. This approach relates the cytoarchitectonic probabilities observed at a particular functionally defined location to the areal specific null distribution of probabilities across the whole brain (i.e., the full probability map). Importantly, this method avoids the need for a unique classification of voxels to a single cortical area and may increase the comparability between results obtained for different areas. Moreover, as distribution-based labelling quantifies the "central tendency" of an activation with respect to anatomical areas, it will, in combination with the established methods, allow an advanced characterisation of the anatomical substrates of functional activations. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the various methods are discussed, focussing on the question of which approach is most appropriate for a particular situation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The new algorithm incorporates multi-modality images to improve the segmentation performance and the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is adopted to minimize the difference between test image and the one synthesized from the shape and appearance modeling. When compared with manual segmentation, the 2D and 3D experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm is computationally efficient and robust and is promising for automatic segmentation of the lateral ventricles.

Multisensory processing of naturalistic objects in motion: A high-density electrical mapping and source estimation study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						cross-modal; visual; auditory; ERP; distributed source modeling	LATERAL OCCIPITAL COMPLEX; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; RECOGNITION AREAS; CLOSURE PROCESSES; TIME-COURSE; LOW-LEVEL; INTEGRATION; HUMANS; BRAIN; CORTEX	In everyday life, we continuously and effortlessly integrate the multiple sensory inputs from objects in motion. For instance, the sound and the visual percept of vehicles in traffic provide us with complementary information about the location and motion of vehicles. Here, we used high-density electrical mapping and local auto-regressive average (LAURA) source estimation to study the integration of multisensory objects in motion as reflected in event-related potentials (ERPs). A randomized stream of naturalistic multisensory-audiovisual (AV), unisensory-auditory (A), and unisensory-visual (V) "splash" clips (i.e., a drop falling and hitting a water surface) was presented among non-naturalistic abstract motion stimuli. The visual clip onset preceded the "splash" onset by 100 ms for multisensory stimuli. For naturalistic objects early multisensory integration effects beginning 120-140 ms after sound onset were observed over posterior scalp, with distributed sources localized to occipital cortex, temporal lobule, insular, and medial frontal gyrus (MFG). These effects, together with longer latency interactions (210-250 and 300-350 ms) found in a widespread network of occipital, temporal, and frontal areas, suggest that naturalistic objects in motion are processed at multiple stages of multisensory integration. The pattern of integration effects differed considerably for non-naturalistic stimuli. Unlike naturalistic objects, no early interactions were found for non-naturalistic objects. The earliest integration effects for non-naturalistic stimuli were observed 210-250 ms after sound onset including large portions of the inferior parietal cortex (IPC). As such, there were clear differences in the cortical networks activated by multisensory motion stimuli as a consequence of the semantic relatedness (or lack thereof) of the constituent sensory elements.

Memory and the medial temporal lobe: Hemispheric specialization reconsidered	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							MATERIAL-SPECIFIC LATERALIZATION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; NOVELTY RESPONSES; EPILEPSY PATIENTS; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPUS; EPISODIC MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FMRI; ANTERIOR; ACTIVATION	The role of the medial temporal lobe in learning and memory has been well established in research on humans and other animals. In humans, clinical and neuroimaging studies typically suggest material-specific lateralization in which the left and right temporal lobes are associated with verbal and nonverbal memory, respectively. It is often assumed that the temporal lobes are functionally alike, differing only in terms of the content to be learned. Here we present data that challenge this notion, showing that the type of material used during a memory task can influence fMRI activation patterns beyond the expected left-verbal/right-nonverbal dichotomy. Our results also suggest some degree of functional asymmetry in the medial temporal lobe that is independent of material type, pointing to underlying processing differences between the left and right temporal lobes.

Manipulation capacities were tested by comparing immediate serial recall with alphabetical-order recall of words. Divided attention was tested with the Brown-Peterson procedure, in which participants divide their attention between simple addition tasks and consonant trigrams over delays. Inhibition was tested with the Hayling procedure, in which participants complete sentences with words irrelevant to their context. Persons with AD showed severe impairment on the 3 attentional control components. Persons with MCI exhibited impaired performance on the Brown-Peterson procedure but normal performance on the other 2 tasks. With AD and MCI participants, there was a negative correlation between general cognitive deficits and impairment on attentional control tasks, indicating that attentional control deficits increase in the MCI/AD continuum. When separating MCI with and without significant subsequent decline, those with subsequent decline showed impaired performance on both the Brown-Peterson procedure and manipulation task. These data suggest that control of attention tasks can track AD at a preclinical stage and that impairment increases gradually during the preclinical phase of AD.

Timed walking speed for 6 to 15 m and the distance walked in 2 to 12 minutes are frequently used outcome measures in rehabilitation trials, presumably reflecting different aspects of walking ability. The database from the Spinal Cord Injury Locomotor Trial (SCILT), which tested 2 interventions for mobility upon admission for initial rehabilitation of an incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), was used to compare the walking speed employed for each test. Methods. From 66 to 70 patients with upper motor neuron lesions from C-5 to T-10 performed a 15.2-m and a 6-minute walk as fast as the patient deemed safe at 3 months (end of the trial intervention) and 6 and 12 months after entry. The means, standard errors, and quartiles were calculated for the speed used for each task. Results. The mean speed for the 15.2-m walk did not differ from that used for the 6-minute walk at 3 and 6 months but was significantly faster at 12 months. Differences became apparent at each assessment in patients in the highest quartiles (> 1.0 m/s) for the 15.2-m walk. Their speed was from 14% to 24% higher than the speed used for the 6-minute walk. Conclusion. The speed of the 15.2-m walk as a measure of walking ability compared to the distance walked in 6 minutes may not represent separable domains of mobility. Differences were apparent only in the most highly functional patients, who could ambulate in the community Any difference in the walking speed used for these 2 tasks does not make enough of a clinical distinction to encourage including both a 6-minute walk and a 15.2-m walk as outcome measures in clinical trials of locomotor interventions for SCI.

Manganese highly accumulates in astrocytes, which renders these cells more vulnerable to its toxicity. Consistent with this vulnerability, manganese has been shown to cause histopathological changes in astrocytes (Alzheimer type II change), generates oxidative stress and bring about mitochondrial dysfunction, including the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) in astrocytes. In addition to manganism, increased brain levels of manganese have been found in hepatic encephalopathy, a chronic neurological condition associated with liver dysfunction, wherein Alzheimer type II astrocytic changes are also observed. As low-grade brain edema, possibly secondary to astrocyte swelling, has been reported in hepatic encephalopathy, we hypothesized that manganese may contribute to such edema. We therefore exposed cultured astrocytes to manganese (Mn3+) acetate (25 and 50 mu M) for different time periods and examined for changes in cell volume. Manganese dose-dependently induced astrocyte swelling; such swelling was first observed at 12 h (28%), which further increased (54%) at later time points (24-48 h). Pretreatment of astrocyte cultures with antioxidants, including vitamin E, the spin trapping agent PBN, and the iron-chelating agent desferroximine, as well as the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME, all significantly blocked (50-80%) astrocyte swelling caused by manganese, suggesting that oxidative/nitrosative stress is involved in the mechanism of such swelling. Cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of mPT also blocked (90%) manganese-induced astrocyte swelling. The data indicate that manganese exposure results in astrocyte swelling and such swelling, at least in part, may be caused by oxidative stress and/or mPT. Astrocyte swelling by manganese may represent an important aspect of manganese neurotoxicity, and may be a factor in low-grade brain edema associated with chronic hepatic encephalopathy.

However, subcortical nuclei, including the periaqueductal gray and the rostroventral medulla, also show selective activation when,subjects expect pain relief. These brainstem regions send inhibitory projections to the spine and produce diffuse analgesic responses. Regrettably the precise contribution of spinal mechanisms in predicting the strength of placebo analgesia is unknown. Here, we show that expectations regarding pain radically change the strength of spinal nociceptive responses in humans. We found that contrary to expectations of analgesia, expectations of hyperalgesia, completely blocked the analgesic effects of descending inhibition on spinal nociceptive reflexes. Somatosensory-evoked brain potentials and pain ratings further confirmed changes in spino-thalamo-cortical responses consistent with expectations and with changes in the spinal response. These findings provide direct evidence that the modulation of pain by expectations is mediated by endogenous pain modulatory systems affecting nociceptive signal processing at the earliest stage of the central nervous system. Expectation effects, therefore, depend as much about what takes place in the spine as they do about what takes place in the brain. Furthermore, complete suppression of the analgesic response normally produced by descending inhibition suggests that anti-analgesic expectations can block the efficacy of pharmacologically valid treatments which has important implications for clinical practice.

The function of ABCG2 (BCRP), a member of the ATP-binding, cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane-associated drug transporters, at the blood-brain barrier remains highly controversial. This project investigates the functional expression of endogenous ABCG2 in cultures of human and rodent brain cellular compartments. Materials and Methods. RT-PCR, western blot and fluorescent immunocytochemical analyses were performed on ABCG2-overexpressing human breast cancer (MCF-MX100) cells, human and rat brain microvessel endothelial (HBEC and RBE4, respectively), and rat glial cells. Results. RT-PCR analysis detected ABCG2 mRNA in all the cell culture systems. Western blot analysis with anti-ABCG2 monoclonal BXP-21 antibody detected a robust band at similar to 72 kDa in the ABCG2-overexpressing MCF-MX100 cell line, whereas low expression was found in human and rat brain cell systems. Immunofluorescence microscopy detected predominant plasma membrane localization of ABCG2 in MCF-MX100 cells but weak signal in all brain cellular compartments. In the presence of ABCG2 inhibitors, the accumulation of H-3-mitoxantrone and pheophorbide A, two established ABCG2 substrates, was significantly increased in MCF-MX100 cells but not in the human and rodent brain cell culture systems. Conclusions. Our data show low endogenous ABCG2 protein expression, localization and activity in cultures of human and rat brain microvessel endothelial and glial cells.

This event-related potential (ERP) study determined (1) whether backward inhibition (BI) is exerted preferentially in high interference environments, and (2) whether ERPs locked to critical time points reflect BI during cue preparation and/or response stages. High interference (HI) and low interference (LI) were created by manipulating task difficulty. A reaction time (RT) BI effect (i.e., BI > control trials) was shown only during HI tasks. Cue-locked ERPs on LI tasks suggest increased attentional resources were allocated during the reactivation of a recently inhibited task. For HI tasks, BI versus control trial differences were reflected in a response-locked ERP negativity only after response selection (indexed by the response-locked lateralized readiness potential), indicating that BI is a lateral inhibition mechanism exerted during response preparation.

Materials and Methods: Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and approval was obtained from the ethics review boards of all participating institutions. Nonenhanced T2- weighted and dynamic gadolinium- enhanced T1- weighted MR imaging examinations were performed at baseline and 1 week, 4 weeks, and 6 months after VTP in 25 men ( age range, 58 - 83 years; mean age, 73 years) as part of a prospective phase I/ II trial. Percentage of MR- depicted necrosis was defined as the volume of nonenhancing prostatic tissue 1 week after VTP divided by the volume of the prostate. Patterns of intra- and extraprostatic necrosis were recorded. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to test correlations between necrosis and prostate- specific antigen level. Results: Contrast material - enhanced T1- weighted MR images obtained 1 week after therapy showed necrosis in all patients. Treatment margins were irregular in 21 of 25 patients. T2- weighted images showed no clear treatment boundaries in any patient. Extraprostatic necrosis involved the puborectalis or levator ani muscles in 22, obturator internus muscle in 12, periprostatic veins in three, pubic bone marrow in four, and anterior rectal wall in nine of the 25 patients. The neurovascular bundle appeared to be spared in all patients. Percentage of MR- depicted intraprostatic necrosis was correlated with percentage decrease in prostate- specific antigen level ( from baseline) at 4 weeks ( r = 0.41, P = .04) and 12 weeks ( r = 0.45, P = .02). Conclusion: Contrast- enhanced MR imaging depicts irregular margins of intraprostatic treatment effect. This finding suggests varied tissue sensitivities to VTP with palladium- bacteriopheophorbide.

Epigenetic patterns are sculpted during development to shape the diversity of gene expression programs in the different cell types of the organism. The epigenome of the developing fetus is especially sensitive to maternal nutrition, and exposure to environmental toxins as well as psychological stress. It is postulated here that not only chemicals but also exposure of the young pup to social behavior, such as maternal care, could affect the epigenome. Since epigenetic programming defines the state of expression of genes, epigenetic differences could have the same consequences as genetic polymorphisms. We will propose here a mechanism linking maternal behavior and epigenetic programming and we will discuss the prospect that similar epigenetic variations generated during early life play a role in generating inter-individual differences in human behavior. We speculate that exposures to different environmental toxins, which affect the epigenetic machinery might alter long-established epigenetic programs in the brain. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

This left temporal P300 reduction has been associated with positive symptom severity and gray matter reduction in the left superior temporal gyrus. We investigated a group of patients with a first episode of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis and a group of normal controls to verify if P300 amplitude asymmetry already exists around the time of presentation for treatment. Relative to normal control subjects, no P300 asymmetry was found in patients. Nevertheless, P300 asymmetry was correlated with the severity of positive symptoms and worse global functioning (GAF), a good predictor of poor outcome. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The NKCC1 cotransporter regulates intracellular [Cl-] and thus the magnitude and polarity of GABA(A) receptor responses in neurons. TRPV1 receptors transduce diverse chemical and natural stimuli in nociceptors and are critical for inflammatory hyperalgesia. Results: Here we have tested the role of spinal NKCC1 cotransporters and TRPV1 receptors in referred allodynia in a model of visceral hyperalgesia in mice. Intrathecal (IT) injection of the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (BUM, 1 nmol) inhibited referred, abdominal allodynia evoked by an intracolonic capsaicin injection. BUM was effective when injected IT either before or up to 4 hrs after the establishment of referred allodynia. The TRPV1 antagonist AMG 9810 (1 nmol) also inhibited referred allodynia in this model suggesting the involvement of an endogenous TRPV1 agonist in the dorsal horn in referred allodynia. In support of this suggestion, the endovanilloid TRPV1 agonist, narachidonoyl-dopamine (NADA, 1 or 10 nmol, IT) evoked stroking allodynia in the hindpaw that was blocked by co-treatment with AMG 9810 (1 nmol). The TRPV1-dependent stroking allodynia caused by NADA appeared to be functionally linked to NKCC1 because BUM (1 nmol) also inhibited NADA-evoked stroking allodynia. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that spinal NKCC1 and TRPV1 are critical for referred allodynia mediated by a painful visceral stimulus. Moreover, they suggest that endogenous TRPV1 agonists, released in the CNS in painful conditions, might stimulate TRPV1 receptors on primary afferents that, in turn, play a role in increasing NKCC1 activity leading to allodynia.

Daily rhythms of clock gene expression throughout the brain and body are normally coordinated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but they are also strongly influenced by daily temporal restrictions of food availability. Here, we studied the effects of a daily restricted presentation of highly palatable complete meal replacement, chocolate Ensure Plus (Ensure) in food-deprived (restricted feeding, RF) and free-fed (restricted treat, RT) rats, on the expression of the clock protein, Period2 (PER2) in regions of the brain involved in motivational and emotional regulation; these include the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov), the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the dentate gyrus (DG) and the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). RF and RT rats consumed similar amounts of Ensure, but changes in the pattern of PER2 expression were seen only in the RF condition, suggesting that changes in PER2 expression in these regions are triggered by the daily alleviation of a negative metabolic state associated with RF and are independent of the positive incentive properties of the consumed substance, per se. In contrast, the expression of the immediate early gene, Fos, was increased in these regions by both RF and RT schedules, showing that signals concerning the incentive value of the consumed food reach these regions. No changes in either PER2 or Fos expression were observed in the SCN of RF or RT rats. These findings demonstrate that mechanisms leading to changes in the expression of PER2 and those affecting the induction of Fos under RF and RT are, at least in part, dissociable. (c) 2007 IBRO.

Several previous studies have predicted that carboxypeptidase-E (CPE), prohormone convertase 1 (PC1) and prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) may function as sorting elements for somatostatin (SST) for its maturation and processing to appropriate targets. However, nothing is currently known about whether brain, neuronal culture or even endocrine cells express SST, CPE, PC1 and PC2 and exhibit colocalization. Accordingly, in the present study using peroxidase immunohistochemistry, double-labeled indirect immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, we mapped the distributional pattern of SST, CPE, PC1 and PC2 in different rat brain regions. Additionally, we also determined the colocalization of SST with CPE, PC1 and PC2 as well as colocalization of CPE with PC1 and PC2. The localization of SST, CPE, PC1 and PC2 reveals a distinct and region specific distribution pattern in the rat brain. Using an indirect double-label immunofluorescence method we observed selective neuron specific colocalization in a region specific manner in cortex, striatum and hippocampus. These studies provide the first evidence for colocalization between SST, CPE, PC1 and PC2 as well as CPE with PC1 and PC2. SST in cerebral cortex colocalized in pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons with CPE, PC1 and PC2. Most importantly, in striatum and hippocampus colocalization was mostly observed selectively and preferentially in interneurons. CPE is also colocalized with PC1 and PC2 in a region specific manner. The data presented here provide a new insight into the distribution and colocalization of SST, CPE, PC1 and PC2 in rat brain. Taken together, our data anticipate the possibility that CPE, PC1 and PC2 might be potential target for the maturation of SST. (c) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study aims to: 1) compare the modulation of walking speed in response to OF speed changes between persons with stroke and healthy controls and 2) investigate whether virtual environments (VE) manipulating OF speed can be used to promote volitional changes in walking speed post stroke. Methods: Twelve persons with stroke and 12 healthy individuals walked on a self-paced treadmill while viewing a virtual corridor in a helmet-mounted display. Two experiments were carried out on the same day. In experiment 1, the speed of an expanding OF was varied sinusoidally at 0.017 Hz (sine duration = 60 s), from 0 to 2 times the subject's comfortable walking speed, for a total duration of 5 minutes. In experiment 2, subjects were exposed to expanding OFs at discrete speeds that ranged from 0.25 to 2 times their comfortable speed. Each test trial was paired with a control trial performed at comfortable speed with matching OF. For each of the test trials, subjects were instructed to walk the distance within the same time as during the immediately preceding control trial. VEs were controlled by the CAREN-2 system (Motek). Instantaneous changes in gait speed (experiment 1) and the ratio of speed changes in the test trial over the control trial (experiment 2) were contrasted between the two groups of subjects. Results: When OF speed was changing continuously (experiment 1), an out-of-phase modulation was observed in the gait speed of healthy subjects, such that slower OFs induced faster walking speeds, and vice versa. Persons with stroke displayed weaker (p < 0.05, T-test) correlation coefficients between gait speed and OF speed, due to less pronounced changes and an altered phasing of gait speed modulation. When OF speed was manipulated discretely (experiment 2), a negative linear relationship was generally observed between the test-control ratio of gait speed and OF speed in healthy and stroke individuals. The slope of this relationship was similar between the stroke and healthy groups (p > 0.05, T-test). Conclusion: Stroke affects the modulation of gait speed in response to changes in the perception of movement through different OF speeds. Nevertheless, the preservation of even a modest modulation enabled the persons with stroke to increase walking speed when presented with slower OFs. Manipulation of OF speed using virtual reality technology could be implemented in a gait rehabilitation intervention to promote faster walking speeds after stroke.

Adult Neurology Dept KIDMUS Study	Natural history of multiple sclerosis with childhood onset	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							PARACLINICAL FEATURES; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; DISABILITY; CHILDREN; AGE; PROGRESSION; COHORT; MS	Background: The course and prognosis of childhood-onset multiple sclerosis have not been well described. Methods: We used data from 13 adult neurology departments affiliated with the European Database for Multiple Sclerosis (EDMUS) network to identify a cohort of 394 patients who had multiple sclerosis with an onset at 16 years of age or younger and a comparison group of 1775 patients who had multiple sclerosis with an onset after 16 years of age. We determined the initial clinical features, the dates of disease onset, and the occurrence of outcomes, including relapse, conversion to secondary progression, and irreversible disability as measured by scores of 4 (limited walking ability but ability to walk more than 500 m without aid or rest), 6 (ability to walk with unilateral support no more than 100 m without rest), and 7 (ability to walk no more than 10 m without rest while using a wall or furniture for support) on the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale (range, 0 to 10; higher scores indicate more severe disability). Results: For patients with childhood-onset multiple sclerosis, the estimated median time from onset to secondary progression was 28 years, and the median age at conversion to secondary progression was 41 years. The median times from onset to disability scores of 4, 6, and 7 were 20.0, 28.9, and 37.0 years, respectively, and the corresponding median ages were 34.6, 42.2, and 50.5 years. In comparison with patients with adult-onset disease, those with childhood-onset disease were more likely to be female than male (female:male ratio, 2.8 vs. 1.8), were more likely to have an exacerbating-remitting initial course (98% vs. 84%), took approximately 10 years longer to reach secondary progression and irreversible disability, and reached these landmarks at an age approximately 10 years younger (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusions: Patients with childhood-onset multiple sclerosis take longer to reach states of irreversible disability but do so at a younger age than patients with adult-onset multiple sclerosis.

Cellular iron export is impaired in mice and humans with aceruloplasminemia, an iron overload disease due to mutations in the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin (Cp). In the absence of Cp Fpn is rapidly internalized and degraded. Depletion of extracellular Fe(II) by the yeast ferroxidase Fet3p or iron chelators can maintain cell surface Fpn in the absence of Cp. Iron remains bound to Fpn in the absence of multi-copper oxidases. Fpn with bound iron is recognized by a ubiquitin ligase, which ubiquitinates Fpn on lysine 253. Mutation of lysine 253 to alanine prevents ubiquitination and maintains Fpn-iron on cell surface in the absence of ferroxidase activity. The requirement for a ferroxidase to maintain iron transport activity represents a new mechanism of regulating cellular iron export, a new function for Cp and an explanation for brain iron overload in patients with aceruloplasminemia.

J	Bugnariu, N; Fung, J				Bugnariu, Nicoleta; Fung, Joyce			Aging and selective sensorimotor strategies in the regulation of upright balance	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							DYNAMIC VISUAL CUES; CHRONIC SPINAL CAT; POSTURAL RESPONSES; OLDER ADULT; SURFACE; STANCE; REHABILITATION; STABILIZATION; COMPONENTS; SUPPORT	Background: The maintenance of upright equilibrium is essentially a sensorimotor integration task. The central nervous system ( CNS) has to generate appropriate and complex motor responses based on the selective and rapid integration of sensory information from multiple sources. Since each sensory system has its own coordinate framework, specific time delay and reliability, sensory conflicts may arise and represent situations in which the CNS has to recalibrate the weight attributed to each particular sensory input. The resolution of sensory conflicts may represent a particular challenge for older adults given the age- related decline in the integrity of many postural regulating systems, including musculoskeletal and sensory systems, as well as neural processing and conduction of information. The effects of aging and adaptation ( by repeated exposures) on the capability of the CNS to select pertinent sensory information and resolve sensory conflicts were thus investigated with virtual reality ( VR) in the present study. Methods: Healthy young and older adults maintained quiet stance while immersed in a virtual environment ( VE) for 1 hour during which transient visual and/ or surface perturbations were randomly presented. Visual perturbations were induced by sudden pitch or roll plane tilts of the VE viewed through a helmet- mounted display, and combined with or without surface perturbations presented in a direction that was either identical or opposite to the visual perturbations. Results: Results showed a profound influence of aging on postural adjustments measured by electromyographic ( EMG) responses and displacements of the center of pressure ( COP) and body's center of mass ( COM) in the recovery of upright stance, especially in the presence of sensory conflicts. Older adults relied more on vision as compared to young adults. Aging affects the interaction of the somatosensory and visual systems on the control of equilibrium during standing and the ability of CNS to resolve sensory conflicts. However, even with a one- hour immersion in VE and exposure to sensory conflicts, it is possible for the CNS to recalibrate and adapt to the changes, while improving balance capability in older adults. Conclusion: Preventive and rehabilitation programs targeting postural control in older adults should take into account the possible impairment of sensory organization or sensorimotor integration and include VE training under conditions of sensory conflicts.

Although, external anions and cations apparently coactivate kainate receptors ( KARs) in an identical manner, it has yet to be established how ions of opposite charge achieve this. An additional complication is that KARs are subject to other forms of cation modulation via extracellular acidification ( i. e., protons) and divalent ions. Consequently, other cation species may compete with Na+ to regulate the time KARs remain in the open state. Here we designed experiments to unravel how external ions regulate GluR6 KARs. We show that GluR6 kinetics are unaffected by alterations in physiological pH but that divalent and alkali metal ions compete to determine the time course of KAR channel activity. Additionally, Na+ and Cl- ions coactivate GluR6 receptors by establishing a dipole, accounting for theircommoneffect on KARs. Using charged amino acids as tethered ions, we further demonstrate that the docking order is fixed with cations binding first, followed by anions. Together, our findings identify the dipole as a novel gating feature that couples neurotransmitter binding to KAR activation.

The sensitivity of neither the extrasynaptic nor that of the postsynaptic 5-HT I A receptors of the pyramidal neurons was altered, as indicated by their unchanged responsiveness to the microiontophoretic application of 5 HT, and by the unchanged effect of the electrical stimulation at low frequency of the ascending 5-HT bundle, respectively. Increasing the frequency of stimulation (from 1 to 5 Hz) decreased its efficacy in control rats; the milnacipran treatment abolished this phenomenon. This cannot be attributed to a desensitisation of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptor, since the suppressive effect of 5-HT agonist 5-carboxyamidotryptamine on [(3)H]5-HT release was enhanced in milnacipran-treated rats. As for the NE system, the unchanged suppressing effect of microiontophoretic applications of NE and that of the 5 Hz stimulation in the locus coeruleus (LC) on the firing activity of pyramidal neurons indicates that the milnacipran treatment not altered the sensitivity of extrasynaptic alpha(2)- and postsynaptic alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors on pyramidal cells, as well as that of the presynaptic alpha(2)-autoreceptor on NE terminals. The decreased inhibitory effect of NE on the [(3)H]5-HT release in milnacipran-treated rats revealed that this treatment results in a desensitisation of the presynaptic alpha(2)-heteroreceptor located on serotonergic terminals. Taken together with the decreased suppressive effect of a low frequency of stimulation of the NE tract, the present results suggest that long-term milnacipran treatment enhances the efficacy of the 5-HT and reduces that of the NE neurotransmission.

Glutamate transporter EAAT4 is increased in hippocampal astrocytes following lateral fluid-percussion injury in the rat	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; glutamate transporter; EAAT4; excitotoxicity; astrocyte; fluid-percussion; brain trauma	PURKINJE-CELL VULNERABILITY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; GATED CHLORIDE CHANNEL; EXPRESSION; GLT-1; LOCALIZATION; CEREBELLUM; PROTEINS; GLAST; MILD	Functional impairment of glutamate transporters contributes to excitotoxic damage and exacerbation of injury in certain neurodegenerative disorders. Several high-affinity sodium-dependent glutamate transporters have been cloned thus far. Of these, EAAT4 is abundantly expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in rats. However, little is currently known regarding levels of EAAT4 following traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, EAAT4 changes were examined for up to 7 days after moderate fluid-percussion by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. TBI caused a 20% and 25% increase in EAAT4 levels in the injured hippocampus at day 3 and day 7 following the insult. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed this increase to be localized in cells exhibiting morphological characteristics of astrocytes. In addition, increased EAAT4 immunoreactivity was observed in astrocytes in the ipsilateral cortex and cerebellum at day 3 post-injury that persisted up to 7 days after the insult. Given the reported novel characteristics of chloride conductance displayed by this transporter, our findings of increased EAAT4 levels suggest this protein may play an important role in the pathophysiology of TBI.

To determine the physiological importance of PC I, we produced a mutant mouse from embryonic stem cells in which its locus (Pcsk1) had been inactivated by homologous recombination. The inactivating mutation consisted of a 32.7-kb internal deletion and a 1.8 kb insertion of the bacterial neomycin resistance gene (neo) under the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase I protein (PGKneo). Intercross of Pcsk1(+/-) mice produced no Pck1(-/-) offspring or blastocysts; in addition, more than 80% of the offspring were Pcsk1(+/-). These observations suggested that the mutation caused preimplantation lethality of homozygous embryos and preferential transmission of the mutant allele. Interestingly, RT-PCR analysis on RNA from endocrine tissues from Pcsk1(+/-) mice revealed the presence of aberrant transcripts specifying the N-terminal half of the PC1 propeptide fused to neo gene product. Mass spectrometric profiles of proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides in the anterior pituitary were similar between Pcsk1(+/-) and Pcsk1(+/+) mice, but significantly different between male and female mice of the same genotype. Relative to their wild-type counterparts, female mutant mice exhibited stunted growth under a low fat diet, and catch-up growth under a high-fat diet. The complex phenotype exhibited by this Pcsk1 mutant mouse model may be due to PC1 deficiency aggravated by expression of aberrant gene products from the mutant allele. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate how cells integrate information from extrinsic and intrinsic inputs, we examined Brachyury (Hr-Bra) promoter activity in the early embryo. Hr-Bra, which encodes a key transcription factor for notochord development, is expressed exclusively in notochord precursors in a manner dependent on the FGF-MEK-MAPK-Ets signaling pathway and on the intrinsic factors Zic and FoxA. Reporter gene expression driven by the 900-bp upstream region of the Hr-Bra promoter was detected as early as the 110-cell stage in notochord precursors by in situ hybridization with a LacZ probe. Deletion analysis combined with MEK inhibitor treatment demonstrated that the -598/-499 region carries FGF-responsiveness. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified three Ets-binding sites in this region that were required for promoter activity. Further deletion analysis conducted by injecting eggs with reporter constructs at higher concentration suggested that the -398/-289 region also has enhancer activity, although ectopic reporter expression was detected in nerve cord and endoderm precursors. The -398/-289 region has a Zic-binding site that was also essential for the enhancer activity. These results indicate that Ets and Zic-binding sites are critical for the initiation of Hr-Bra expression. In conclusion, information from both extrinsic and intrinsic factors is integrated at the level of enhancer of the target gene by direct binding of the transcription factors to the enhancer region.

Primary cell cultures prepared from nervous tissue are often used to study the properties of individual cell types and how they interact with each other. Isolation of pure populations of cells and their culture is challenging, particularly from murine spinal cord. The purpose of this study was to optimize various protocols to achieve efficient, parallel isolation and purification of primary motor neurons, microglia and astrocytes from the same mouse embryonic spinal cord sample. Following dissociation of E 12 embryonic spinal cords, motor neurons were isolated at 97% purity by a single step centrifugation of the cell suspension through multiple discontinuous density gradients of NycoPrep (TM). The residual mixed cell pellet was resuspended and cultured for 2 weeks. Mixed cultures were then shaken to release microglia, which were then harvested from the medium and subjected to another round of differential adhesion to achieve 99% purity. The astrocytes remaining in the mixed cultures were culled to 98% purity by treatment with leucine methyl ester and a subsequent vigorous shaking step to remove any remaining microglia and neurons. Furthermore, no cross contamination was observed in the glial cultures. This technique provides a simple, convenient, and reliable method of obtaining highly purified preparations of motor neurons, microglia and astrocytes from embryonic spinal cord for the study of spinal cord cell biology and motor neuron diseases.

As the technique is relatively new, few systematic studies on the behavioral effects in long-term treated patients are available. To further study the putative effects of STN-DBS on mood and emotional processing, 15 consecutive PD patients under STN-DBS for at least 1 year, were tested ON and OFF stimulation while on or off medication, with instruments sensitive to short-term changes in mood and in emotional discrimination. After acute changes in experimental conditions, mood core dimensions (depression, elation, anxiety) and emotion discrimination processing remained remarkably stable, in the face of significant motor changes. Acute stimulator challenge in long-term STN-DBS-treated PD patients does not appear to provoke clinically relevant mood effects. (c) 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

Is there seasonal variation in risk of Parkinson's disease?	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; epidemiology; seasonal variation	SCHIZOPHRENIA; INFLUENZA; BIRTH	Recent studies suggest that, for many adult-onset neurological diseases, persons born at a certain time of year are at higher risk of the disease. Small-scale studies have suggested that persons born in the spring may be at higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) late in life. There have also been suggestions that there are clusters of PD birth dates in the years of major influenza pandemics. To determine whether there is any seasonal variation in the birth dates of PD patients, we examined birth dates of 8,168 PD patients collected from subspecialty movement disorder clinics across Canada. Patterns of seasonality of birth were examined and compared with the general Canadian population. In addition, we compared counts of patients born in the years of major influenza pandemics with the number born in the surrounding years. We found no evidence of systematic seasonal variation in PD incidence by birth date, or of clustering of birth dates during influenza pandemic years in PD patients.

We thus investigated here the effect of SCN stimulation on neurons of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) thought to be involved in promoting sleep. Using an acute in vitro preparation of the rat anterior hypothalamus/preoptic area, we found that whereas single-pulse stimulations of the SCN evoked standard fast ionotropic IPSPs and EPSPs, train stimulations unexpectedly evoked a long-lasting inhibition (LLI). Such LLIs could also be evoked in VLPO neurons by pressure application of NMDA within the SCN, indicating the specific activation of SCN neurons. This LLI was shown to result from the presynaptic facilitation of noradrenaline release, because it was suppressed in presence of yohimbine, a selective antagonist of alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors. The LLI depended on the opening of a potassium conductance, because it was annulled at E-K and could be reversed below EK. These results show that the SCN can provide an LLI of the sleep-promoting VLPO neurons that could play a role in the circadian organization of the sleep - waking cycle.

CAR is enriched in growth cone particles (GCP) after subcellular fractionation. In GCP, we identified actin as an interaction partner of the cytoplasmic domain of CAR. In vivo, actin and CAR co-inummoprecipitate and co-localize. In vitro, the binding is direct, with a K-d of similar to 2.6 mu M, and leads to actin bundling. We previously demonstrated that CAR interacts with microtubules. These data suggest a role for CAR in processes requiring dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton such as neurite outgrowth and cell migration.

Although we know that tactile memory signals can be found in the prefrontal cortex, the contribution of the different prefrontal areas to tactile memory remains unclear. The present functional MRI study shows that a specific part of the prefrontal cortex in the human brain, namely the midventrolateral prefrontal region (cytoarchitectonic areas 47/12 and 45), is involved in active controlled retrieval processing necessary for the disambiguation of vibrotactile information in short-term memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this particular part of the prefrontal cortex interacts functionally with the secondary somatosensory areas in the parietal operculum and the rostral inferior parietal lobule during controlled processing for the retrieval of specific tactile information.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the cognate ligand for TrkA, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor for TrkB, and NT-3 for TrkC. NT-3 also binds TrkA as a lower affinity heterologous ligand. Because neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) interactions with TrkA are biologically relevant, we aimed to define the TrkA "hot spot" functional docking sites of NT-3. The Trk extracellular domain consists of two cysteine-rich subdomains (D1 and D3), flanking a leucine-rich subdomain (D2), and two immunoglobulin-like subdomains IgC1(D4) and IgC2(D5). Previously, the D5 subdomain was defined as the primary ligand-binding site of neurotrophins for their cognate receptors (e.g. NGF binds and activates through TRKA-D5 hot spots). Here binding studies with truncated and chimeric extracellular subdomains show that TRKA-D5 also includes an NT-3 docking and activation hot spot (site 1), and competition studies show that the NGF and NT-3 hot spots on TRKA-D5 are distinct but partially overlapping. In addition, ligand binding studies provide evidence for an NT-3-binding/allosteric site on TRKA-D4 (site 2). NT-3 docking on sites 1 and/ or 2 partially blocks NGF binding. Functional survival studies showed that sites 1 and 2 regulate TrkA activation. NT-3 docking on both sites 1 and 2 affords full agonism, which can be additive with NGF activation of Trk. However, NT-3 docking solely on site 1 is partially agonistic but noncompetitively antagonizes NGF binding and activation of Trk. This study demonstrates that Trk signaling is more complex than previously thought because it involves several receptor subdomains and hot spots.

Excessively risky or overly cautious decision making can both have disastrous real-world consequences. Weighing of risks and benefits toward decision making involves a complex neural network that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), but its role remains unclear. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have shown that disruption of the DLPFC increases risk-taking behavior. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allows upregulation of activity in the DLPFC, and we predicted that it might promote more cautious decision making. Healthy participants received one of the following treatments while they performed the Balloon Analog Risk Task: (1) right anodal/ left cathodal DLPFC tDCS, (2) left anodal/ right cathodal DLPFC tDCS, or (3) sham tDCS. This experiment revealed that participants receiving either one of the bilateral DLPFC tDCS strategies adopted a risk-averse response style. In a control experiment, we tested whether unilateral DLPFC stimulation (anodal tDCS over the right or left DLPFC with the cathodal electrode over the contralateral supraorbital area) was sufficient to decrease risk-taking behaviors. This experiment showed no difference in decision-making behaviors between the groups of unilateral DLPFC stimulation and sham stimulation. These findings extend the notion that DLPFC activity is critical for adaptive decision making, possibly by suppressing riskier responses. Anodal tDCS over DLPFC by itself did not significantly change risk-taking behaviors; however, when the contralateral DLPFC was modulated with cathodal tCDS, an important decrease in risk taking was observed. Also, the induced cautious decision-making behavior was observed only when activity of both DLPFCs was modulated. The ability to modify risk-taking behavior may be translated into therapeutic interventions for disorders such as drug abuse, overeating, or pathological gambling.

Oxidative conditions cause not only structural damage but also changes in the set points of redox-sensitive signaling processes including the insulin receptor signaling pathway. In the absence of insulin, the otherwise low insulin receptor signaling is strongly enhanced by oxidative conditions. Autophagic proteolysis and sirtuin activity, in turn, are downregulated by the insulin signaling pathway, and impaired autophagic activity has been associated with neurodegeneration. In genetic studies, impairment of insulin receptor signaling causes spectacular lifespan extension in nematodes, fruit flies, and mice. The predicted effects of age-related oxidative stress on sirtuins and autophagic activity and the corresponding effects of antioxidants remain to be tested experimentally. However, several correlates of aging have been shown to be ameliorated by antioxidants. Oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA and the electron transport chain, perturbations in brain iron and calcium homeostasis, and changes in plasma cysteine homeostasis may altogether represent causes and consequences of increased oxidative stress. Aging and cognitive decline thus appear to involve changes at multiple nodes within a complex regulatory network.

To study the potential antinociceptive effect of propofol, we administered different doses (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 500 mu g) of the anesthetic in the hind paw of animals to determine an ED50. To further investigate the mechanisms by which propofol produced its antinociceptive effect, we used specific antagonists for the cannabinoid CB1 (AM251) and CB2 (AM630) receptors an measured fatty-acid amide/endocannabinoid (anandamide, 2-arachidonylglycerol, and palmitoylethanolamide) concentrations in skin paw tissues. METHODS: Formalin tests were performed on 65 Wistar rats allocated to six different groups: 1) control (Intralipid (TM) 10%); 2) propofol (ED50 dose); 3) AM251; 4) AM251 + propofol; 5) AM630; 6) AM630 + propofol. Drugs were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal surface of the hind paw (50 mu L) 15 min before 2.5% formalin injection into the same paw. Fatty-acid amide/endocannabinoid levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS: Propofol produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect for the early and late phases of the formalin test with an ED50 of 0.08 +/- 0.061 mu g for the latter phase. This effect was antagonized by AM251 and AM630. It was locally mediated, since a higher dose of propofol given in the contralateral paw was not antinociceptive. Finally, only paw concentrations of palmitoylethanolamide were significantly increased. CONCLUSION: In a test of inflammatory pain, locally injected propofol decreased pain behavior in a dose-dependent manner. This antinociceptive effect was mediated, in part, by CB1 and CB2 receptors.

Mutations in the SPG3A gene, which encodes the large guanosine triphosphatase atlastin, are the second most Common cause of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia. In a large SPG3A screen of 70 hereditary spastic paraplegia subjects, a novel in-frame deletion, p.del436N, was identified. Characterization of this deletion showed that it affects neither the guanosine triphosphatase activity of atlastin nor interactions between atlastin and spastin. Interestingly, immunoblot analysis of lymphoblasts from affected patients demonstrated a significant reduction in atlastin protein levels, supporting a loss-of-function disease mechanism.

Buffer allocation and performance modeling in asynchronous assembly system operations: An artificial neural network metamodeling approach	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						artificial neural networks; metamodel; assembly systems; simulation	SERIAL PRODUCTION LINES; MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; UNRELIABLE MACHINES; PARALLEL MACHINES; SIMULATION; DESIGN; INVENTORY; PRODUCTS	This article investigates metamodeling opportunities in buffer allocation and performance modeling in asynchronous assembly systems ( AAS). Practical challenges to properly design these complex systems are emphasized. A critical review of various approaches in modeling and evaluation of assembly systems reported in the recently published literature, with a special emphasis on the buffer allocation problems, is given. Various applications of artificial intelligence techniques on manufacturing systems problems, particularly those related to artificial neural networks, are also reviewed. Advantages and the drawbacks of the metamodeling approach are discussed. In this context, a metamodeling application on AAS buffer design/performance modeling problems in an attempt to extend the application domain of metamodeling approach to manufacturing/assembly systems is presented. An artificial neural network ( ANN) metamodel is developed for a simulation model of an AAS. The ANN and regression metamodels for each AAS are compared with respect to their deviations from the simulation results. The analysis shows that the ANN metamodels can successfully be used to model of AASs. Consequently, one concludes that practising engineers involved in assembly system design can potentially benefit from the advantages of the metamodeling approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

Manganese-induced parkinsonism associated with methcathinone (ephedrone) abuse	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							BASAL GANGLIA; INTOXICATION; CIRRHOSIS; DISEASE; IMAGES; SIGNAL; BRAIN; MRI; PET	Background: Manganese intoxication may lead to a levodoparesistant, akinetic-rigid syndrome. A new form of presumed manganese poisoning has been reported in drug-addicted persons from Russia, Ukraine, and Estonia who have intravenously injected self-prepared methcathinone hydrochloride ( Ephedrone). Patient: A 36-year-old man from Azerbaijan with hepatitis C and only modest hepatic synthetic dysfunction developed rapid-onset, levodopa-resistant parkinsonism with profound hypophonia. Conclusion: Ephedronic encephalopathy outside the region of the former Soviet Union may become a more widespread public health problem as a result of global travel and the easy availability of the recipe for synthesis of methcathinone on the Internet.

Groups of male rats were implanted with a stimulation electrode and preexposed to brain stimulation at parameters set to equate rewarding effectiveness across rats. Control groups were implanted with an electrode but never stimulated, or not implanted at all. Twenty-four hours after the 12th self-stimulation session, all groups were challenged with amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, ip), nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, sc), or saline, and locomotor activity was measured for 1 hr. Locomotor responses to amphetamine and to nicotine were significantly greater in rats preexposed to brain stimulation. These findings suggest at least partial overlap of underlying substrates.

In this study, the mechanism of iron transport in the extremely halophilic Euryarchaeon Halobacterium salinarum strain JW 5 was analyzed. Under low-iron growth conditions no siderophores were detectable in culture supernatants. However, various xenosiderophores support growth of H. salinarum. In [Fe-55]-[C-14] double-label experiments, H. salinarum displays uptake of iron but not of the chelator citrate. Uptake of iron was inhibited by cyanide and at higher concentrations by Ga. Furthermore, a K-M for iron uptake in cells of 2.36 mu M and a V-max of approximately 67 pmol Fe/min/mg protein was determined. [Fe-55]-uptake kinetics were measured in the absence and presence of Ga. Uptake of iron was inhibited merely at very high Ga concentrations. The results indicate an energy dependent iron uptake process in H. salinarum and suggest reduction of the metal at the membrane level.

In bipolar disorder (BD), as many as 15% of patients may commit suicide and family history of suicide is recognized as one of the most important risk factors. Lithium reduces the rates of suicidal behavior in BD, especially in patients who achieve full mood stabilization. Yet even patients who continue experiencing mood episodes do benefit from anti-suicidal properties of lithium. These observations raise questions about the nature of the relationship between the neurobiological mechanisms of BD and suicide, namely whether they are shared or independent. Methods: We studied the distribution of suicides and suicide attempts in 539 subjects from 78 families of probands with major AD, all responders to lithium prophylaxis. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to assess the contribution of several independent variables to the risks of AD, BD, and suicidal behavior. Results: The lifetime prevalence of BD was significantly greater among first-degree relatives of suicide than non-suicide probands (22% versus 11%) and the prevalence of BD in families was associated with an increased risk of developing mood disorder and subsequently committing or attempting suicide (p = 0.003). Families fell into 1 of 3 groups, corresponding to a low (< 0.1%), intermediate (17.8%), and high (87.8%) risk for suicide in affectively ill subjects. Conclusions: Suicidal behavior is distributed unevenly in families of probands with BD, aggregating in a subset of families. Our results also suggest that partially overlapping sets of genetic factors may underlie BD and suicide.

Recently, a skeletal muscle receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK)-interacting cytoplasmic protein termed Dok-7 has been identified. Subsequently, we and others identified mutations in DOK7 as a cause of congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), providing evidence for a crucial role of Dok-7 in maintaining synaptic structure. Here we present clinical and molecular genetic data of 14 patients from 12 independent kinships with 13 different mutations in the DOK7 gene. The clinical picture of CMS with DOK7 mutations is highly variable.The age of onset may vary between birth and the third decade. However, most of the patients display a characteristic 'limb-girdle' pattern of weakness with a waddling gait and ptosis, but without ophthal-moparesis. Respiratory problems were frequent. Patients did not benefit from long-term therapy with esterase inhibitors; some of the patients even worsened. DOK7 mutations have emerged as one of the major genetic defects in CMS. The clinical picture differs significantly from CMS caused by mutations in other genes, such as the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunit genes. None of the patients with DOK7 mutations had tubular aggregates in the muscle biopsy, implying that 'limb-girdle myasthenia (LGM) with tubular aggregates' previously described in literature may be a pathogenic entity distinct from CMS caused by DOK7 mutations.

Examples are ischemic optic neuropathy, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, and traumatic optic neuropathy. In some cases, the pathophysiology of the optic nerve injury is not fully understood. For example, while the demyelinative aspects of optic neuritis have been studied, the mechanism by which the axonal loss occurs is less apparent. In other cases, although the pathophysiology of the optic neuropathy may be understood, there is difficulty treating the disease, for example, with traumatic optic neuropathy. In response to this therapeutic dearth, the concept of neuroprotection has arisen. Neuroprotection is a therapeutic paradigm for preventing death of neurons from injury and maintaining function. In optic neuropathies, the corresponding neuron is the retinal ganglion cell. These cells are unable to divide, and optic neuropathies irrevocably result in their death; therefore, the primary target of neuroprotection are retinal ganglion cells and their axons. This review emphasizes that most optic neuropathies are axonal and thus good targets for neuroprotection.

Characterizing the role of Hsp90 in production of heat shock proteins in motor neurons reveals a suppressive effect of wild-type Hsf1	CELL STRESS & CHAPERONES			English	Article							AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY; MOLECULAR CHAPERONE; STRESS-RESPONSE; ATPASE ACTIVITY; CULTURE MODEL; SPINAL-CORD; FACTOR-I; ACTIVATION; GELDANAMYCIN	Induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) is under investigation as treatment for neurodegenerative disorders, yet many types of neurons, including motor neurons that degenerate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have a high threshold for activation of the major transcription factor mediating stress-induced Hsp upregulation, heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1). Hsf1 is tightly regulated by a series of inhibitory checkpoints that include sequestration in multichaperone complexes governed by Hsp90. This study examined the role of multichaperone complexes in governing the heat shock response in motor neurons. Hsp90 inhibitors induced expression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 and transactivation of a human inducible hsp70 promoter-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter construct in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord-dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures. On the other hand, overexpression of activator of Hsp90 adenosine triphosphatase ([ATPase 1], Aha1), which should mobilize Hsf1 by accelerating turnover of mature, adenosine triphosphate-(ATP) bound Hsp90 complexes, and death domain-associated protein (Daxx), which in cell lines has been shown to promote transcription of heat shock genes by relieving inhibition exerted by interactions between nuclear Hsp90/multichaperone complexes and trimeric Hsf1, failed to induce Hsps in the absence or presence of heat shock. These results indicate that disruption of multichaperone complexes alone is not sufficient to activate the neuronal heat shock response. Furthermore, in motor neurons, induction of Hsp70 by Hsp90-inhibiting drugs was prevented by overexpression of wild-type Hsf1, contrary to what would be expected for a classical Hsf1-mediated pathway. These results point to additional differences in regulation of hsp genes in neuronal and nonneuronal cells.

J	Poulsen, C; Picton, TW; Paus, T				Poulsen, Catherine; Picton, Terence W.; Paus, Tomas			Age-related changes in transient and oscillatory brain responses to auditory stimulation in healthy adults 19-45 years old	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						auditory evoked potentials; electroencephalography; language; maturation; plasticity; steady-state response	STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; AMPLITUDE-MODULATED TONES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VOICE ONSET TIME; WHOLE-HEAD MEG; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; TEMPORAL CUES; SYSTEM ACTIVITY; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; INTRACEREBRAL SOURCES	The capacity of the human cerebral cortex to track fast temporal changes in auditory stimuli is related to the development of language in children and to deficits in speech perception in the elderly. Although maturation of temporal processing in children and its deterioration in the elderly has been investigated previously, little is known about naturally occurring changes in auditory temporal processing between these limits. The present study examined age-related (19-45 years) changes in 3 electrophysiological measures of auditory processing: 1) the late transient auditory evoked potentials to tone onset, 2) the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) to a 40-Hz frequency-modulated tone, and 3) the envelope following response (EFR) to sweeps of amplitude-modulated white noise from 10 to 100 Hz. With increasing age, the latency of the auditory P1-N1 complex decreased, the oscillatory (ASSR) response became larger and more stable, and the resonant peak of the EFR increased from 38 Hz at 19 years to 46 Hz at 45 years. Source analysis localized these changes to the auditory regions of the temporal lobe. These results indicate persistent adaptation of cortical auditory processes into middle adulthood. We speculate that experience-driven myelination and/or refinement of inhibitory circuits may underlie these changes.

Neuroendocrine disruption and health effects in Elliptio complanata mussels exposed to aeration lagoons for wastewater treatment	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						domestic effluents; mussels; neuro-endocrine disruption; biomarkers	S-TRANSFERASE ACTIVITY; AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; ESTROGENIC CONTAMINATION; PATINOPECTEN-YESSOENSIS; MUNICIPAL EFFLUENTS; DIGESTIVE GLAND; MYTILUS-EDULIS; CAGED MUSSELS; SEROTONIN; SCALLOP	The purpose of this study was to examine neuroendocrine-disrupting effects of two domestic wastewater aeration lagoons on freshwater mussels. Mussels were caged and placed in two final aeration lagoons for treating domestic wastewaters for 60 days, at a site I km downstream of the dispersion plume on the eastern shores of the Richelieu River; the western shore served as the reference site. The mussels were analysed for gonad activity, oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics, stress biomarkers and neuroendocrine status (monoamine and arachidonic acid metabolism). The domestic wastewaters produced many different effects at all levels examined. The gonado-somatic index and vitellogenin-like proteins were significantly induced in both aeration lagoons and gonad pyrimidine synthesis (aspartate transcarbamylase activity) was significantly reduced, indicating that vitellogenin-like proteins were produced while DNA synthesis in gametes remained constant. Biomarkers of oxidative metabolism revealed that global heme oxidase (HO), glutathione S-transferase and Xanthine (caffeine) oxydoreductase (XOR) activities were significantly induced in at least one of the aeration lagoons, but not downstream of the dispersion plume. The activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin (cytochrome P4501A1), dibenzoylfluorescein (cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5) and benzoyloxyresorurufin (cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2136) dealkylases were readily induced by substances sharing structural similarities with coplanar polyaromatic hydrocarbons and hydroxylated or aminated aromatic or cyclic hydrocarbon compounds such as pharmaceuticals or steroids in the domestic wastewaters Biomarkers of toxic stress revealed that exposure to aeration lagoons led to increased production of metallothioneins, lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks, with decreased heme oxygenase activity. LPO was significantly correlated with XOR, HO and cytochrome P4501A1 activities. Neuroendocrine effects included significant increases in dopamine and serotonin levels and in monoamine oxidase (MAO). Dopamine transport in synaptosorne was significantly increased while serotonin transport activity was significantly decreased, suggesting the mussels were in a state of serotonergicity. Moreover, arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase (COX) activity was also readily increased in one aeration lagoon. Aeration lagoons for the treatment of domestic wastewaters are toxic, estrogenic and disrupt the metabolism of monoamines and COX in freshwater mussels.

Because murine coronaviruses induce an MS-like disease, the human coronaviruses (HCoV) are attractive candidates as environmental factors involved in a demyelinating pathology. We previously reported the isolation of HCoV-229E/myelin basic protein (MBP) cross-reactive T-cell lines (TCL) in MS patients. To investigate antigenic cross-reactivity at the molecular level, 155 long-term T-cell clones (TCC) were derived from 32 MS patients by in vitro selection with MBP, proteolipid protein (PLP) or HCoV (strains 229E and OC43). Overall, 114 TCC were virus-specific, 31 were specific for myelin Ag and 10 other were HCoV/myelin cross-reactive. Twenty-eight virus-specific TCC and 7 myelin-specific TCC were obtained from six healthy donors. RACE RT-PCR amplification of the V beta chains of five of ten the cross-reactive TCC confirmed clonality and sequencing identified the CDR3 region associated with cross-reactivity. Our findings have promising implications in the investigation of the rote of molecular mimicry between coronaviruses and myelin in MS as a mechanism related to disease initiation or relapses.

Thus, in a depleted dopaminergic system as seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) one would expect an attenuated Ne. However, studies investigating the error negativities in medicated patients with PD have produced contradictory results and the present study was designed to explore this relationship further. Methods: Using the event-related potential technique and an Eriksen flanker paradigm, we examined error negativities in nonmedicated (drug naive) and medicated PD patients and compared them to those of healthy controls. Results: (a) The error negativities of the nonmedicated and medicated PD patients were attenuated compared to those of healthy elderly controls at frontocentral scalp sites; and (b) nonmedicated and medicated PD patients produced error negativities similar to each other. Conclusions: PD results in diminished error negativities both in the early stage nonmedicated patients and in the later stage medicated patients. Significance: Because both patient groups have reduced dopaminergic functioning compared to healthy controls, these findings are consistent with Ne amplitude being sensitive to modulations in that system.

Uri			Neurotrophic rationale in glaucoma: A TrkA agonist, but not NGF or a p75 antagonist, protects retinal ganglion cells In Vivo	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						glaucoma; neuroprotection; neurotrophin; receptor; retina; ocular hypertension	OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA; GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTORS; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; NONINVASIVE MEASUREMENT; OCULAR HYPERTENSION; RAT MODEL; DEATH; APOPTOSIS; LIGAND; PROGRESSION	Glaucoma is a major cause of vision impairment, which arises from the sustained and progressive apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), with ocular hypertension being a major risk or co-morbidity factor. Because RGC death often continues after normalization of ocular hypertension, growth factor-mediated protection of compromised neurons may be useful. However, the therapeutic use of nerve growth factor (NGF) has not proven effective at delaying RGC death in glaucoma. We postulated that one cause for the failure of NGF may be related to its binding to two receptors, TrkA and p75. These receptors have distinct cellular distribution in the retina and in neurons they induce complex and sometimes opposing activities. Here, we show in an in vivo therapeutic model of glaucoma that a selective agonist of the pro-survival TrkA receptor was effective at preventing RGC death. RGC loss was fully prevented by combining the selective agonist of TrkA with intraocular pressure-lowering drugs. In contrast, neither NGF nor an antagonist of the pro-apoptotic p75 receptor protected RGCs. These results further a neurotrophic rationale for glaucoma. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We set out to identify the activity patterns of reticulospinal (RS) neurons of the hindbrain in fictively swimming (paralyzed) zebrafish larvae. Simultaneous recordings of RS neurons and spinal motoneurons revealed that these were coactive during spontaneous fictive swim episodes. We characterized four types of IRS activity patterns during fictive swimming: (i) a spontaneous pattern of discharges resembling evoked high-frequency spiking during startle responses to touch stimuli, (ii) a rhythmic pattern of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) whose frequency was similar to the motoneuron EPSP frequency during swim episodes, (iii) an arrhythmic pattern consisting of tonic firing throughout swim episodes, and (iv) RS cell activity uncorrelated with motoneuron activity. Despite lesions to the rostral spinal cord that prevented ascending spinal axons from entering the hindbrain (normally starting at similar to 20 h), RS neurons continued to display the aforementioned activity patterns at day 3. However, removal of the caudal portion of the hindbrain prior to the descent of RS axons left the spinal cord network unable to generate the rhythmic oscillations normally elicited by application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), but in similar to 40% of cases chronic incubation in NMDA maintained rhythmic activity. We conclude that there is an autonomous embryonic hindbrain network that is necessary for proper development of the spinal central pattern generator, and that the hindbrain network can partially develop independently of ascending input.

Fibromyalgia patients show an abnormal dopamine response to pain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						chronic pain; descending pain control; dopamine; positron emission tomography	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; D2 RECEPTOR-BINDING; BASAL GANGLIA; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; NOCICEPTION; TRANSMISSION; REGISTRATION; STIMULATION; INVOLVEMENT; MODULATION	Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain and bodily tenderness and is often accompanied by affective disturbances. Accumulating evidence indicates that fibromyalgia may involve a dysfunction of modulatory systems in the brain. While brain dopamine is best known for its role in pleasure, motivation and motor control, recent evidence suggests that it is also involved in pain modulation. Because dopamine is implicated in both pain modulation and affective processing, we hypothesized that fibromyalgia may involve a disturbance of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Fibromyalgia patients and matched healthy control subjects were subjected to deep muscle pain produced by injection of hypertonic saline into the anterior tibialis muscle. In order to determine the endogenous release of dopamine in response to painful stimulation, we used positron emission tomography to examine binding of [C-11]-raclopride (D2/D3 ligand) in the brain during injection of painful hypertonic saline and nonpainful normal saline. Fibromyalgia patients experienced the hypertonic saline as more painful than healthy control subjects. Control subjects released dopamine in the basal ganglia during the painful stimulation, whereas fibromyalgia patients did not. In control subjects, the amount of dopamine release correlated with the amount of perceived pain but in fibromyalgia patients no such correlation was observed. These findings provide the first direct evidence that fibromyalgia patients have an abnormal dopamine response to pain. The disrupted dopaminergic reactivity in fibromyalgia patients could be a critical factor underlying the widespread pain and discomfort in fibromyalgia and suggests that the therapeutic effects of dopaminergic treatments for this intractable disorder should be explored.

Using high-density electrophysiological recording techniques, the present study aimed to examine the development of visual mechanisms, during the first year of life, associated with texture segregation. Forty-two normal full term infants were tested at 1, 3, 6 or 12 months of age. Visual-evoked potentials to low-level stimuli varying in orientation (oriVEP) and higher-level textured stimuli (texVEP) were recorded from 128 scalp electrodes. Difference potentials were obtained to extract the VEP component associated specifically with texture segregation (tsVEP). Results show a clear developmental pattern regarding amplitude, latency and scalp distribution of tsVEP, which appears at around 3 months but does not reach maturity by 12 months of age. A reduction in latency is particularly evident between 3 and 6 months, whereas amplitude shows a gradual increase with a marked increment between 3 and 6 months for low-level orientation stimuli and between 6 and 12 months for higher-level textured stimuli. These developmental patterns are attributed to neural maturational processes such as myelination and synaptogenesis. The differential developmental rates can be explained by delayed maturational processes of brain regions involved in more complex visual processing.

J	Cohen, H; Pourcher, E				Cohen, Henri; Pourcher, Emmanuelle			Intact encoding, impaired consolidation in procedural learning in Parkinson's disease	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; procedural learning; striatofrontal circuits; mirror reading	SKILL; ACQUISITION; MEMORY; MOTOR; ACTIVATION; IMPLICIT; TASK; FMRI	Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients and matched healthy participants were compared on a non-motor procedural task involving semantically related inverted word pairs, and 3 months later to determine the extent of skill consolidation. IPD patients were found to acquire new procedural skills necessary to read these inverted words, thus indicating that they are not impaired in all types of procedural learning. However, results on post-tests 3 months later, revealed significant group differences with IPD subjects showing little off-line learning relative to the controls. This suggests that a dopamine (DA)-deafferented neural system is not consolidated in the same way that a normally DA-innervated system is, and that impaired maintenance of procedures and routines may place IPD patients in a situation of constant relearning of embedded strategies in motor and non-motor domains.

Adult Sprague-Dawley rats 4 weeks after bile duct ligation (BDL)/ Sham-operation, or naive rats fed a hyperammonemic diet (HD), were injected with LPS (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or saline, and killed 3 hours later. LPS administration increased brain water in HD, BDL, and sham-operated groups significantly (P < 0.05), but this was associated with progression to pre-coma stages only in BDL rats. LPS induced cytotoxic brain swelling and maintained anatomical integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Plasma/brain ammonia levels were higher in HD and BDL rats than in sham-operated controls and did not change with LPS administration. Brain glutamine/myoinositol ratio was increased in the HD group but reduced in the BDL animals. There was a background pro-inflammatory cytokine response in the brains of cirrhotic rats, and plasma/brain tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and IL-6 significantly increased in LPS-treated animals. Plasma nitrite/nitrate levels increased significantly in LPS groups compared with non-LPS controls; however, frontal cortex nitrotyrosine levels only increased in the BDL + LPS rats (P < 0.005 versus BDL controls). Conclusion: Injection of LPS into cirrhotic rats induces pre-coma and exacerbates cytotoxic edema because of the synergistic effect of hyperammonemia and the induced inflammatory response. Although the exact mechanism of how hyperammonemia and LPS facilitate cytotoxic edema and pre-coma in cirrhosis is not clear, our data support an important role for the nitrosation of brain proteins.

Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 104 pairs of 8-year-old twins (47 MZ, 57 DZ) to assess genetic-environmental contributions to individual differences in neural activation in two prefrontal cortex (PFC) areas previously shown to be involved in sadness. No genetic effects were found for any area, individual environmental factors entirely accounting for individual variation in brain activation related to sadness. Sadness being the prevailing mood in depression, these findings may be of relevance to the etiology of childhood depressive disorders.

Here we provide rationale for a large-scale study of gene-environment interactions influencing brain and behavior and cardiovascular and metabolic health in adolescence, namely the Saguenay Youth Study (SYS). The SYS is a retrospective study of long-term consequences of prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking (PEMCS) in which multiple quantitative phenotypes are acquired over five sessions (telephone interview, home, hospital, laboratory, and school). To facilitate the search for genes that modify an individual's response to an in utero environment (i.e. PEMCS), the study is family-based (adolescent sibships) and is carried out in a relatively geographically isolated population of the Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean (SLSJ) region in Quebec, Canada. DNA is acquired in both biological parents and in adolescent siblings. A genome-wide scan will be carried out with sib-pair linkage analyses, and fine mapping of identified loci will be done with family-based association analyses. Adolescent sibships (12-18 years of age; two or more siblings per family) are recruited in high schools throughout the SLSJ region; only children of French-Canadian origin are included. Based on a telephone interview, potential participants are classified as exposed or nonexposed prenatally to maternal cigarette smoking; the two groups are matched for the level of maternal education and the attended school. A total of 500 adolescent participants in each group will be recruited and phenotyped. The following types of datasets are collected in all adolescent participants: (1) magnetic resonance images of brain, abdominal fat, and kidneys, (2) standardized and computer-based neuropsychological tests, (3) hospital-based cardiovascular, body-composition and metabolic assessments, and (4) questionnaire-derived measures (e.g. life habits such as eating and physical activity; drug, alcohol use and delinquency; psychiatric symptoms; personality; home and school environment; academic and vocational attitudes). Parents complete a medical questionnaire, home-environment questionnaire, a handedness questionnaire, and a questionnaire about their current alcohol and drug use, depression, anxiety, and current and past antisocial behavior. To date, we have fully phenotyped a total of 408 adolescent participants. Here we provide the description of the SYS and, using the initial sample, we present information on ascertainment, demographics of the exposed and nonexposed adolescents and their parents, and the initial MRI-based assessment of familiality in the brain size and the volumes of grey and white matter.

We begin by introducing the basic principles of genetic studies of complex traits in experimental models. We then illustrate the use of MR-based computational anatomy in vivo and ex vivo, and in combination with histology. This work was carried out in two inbred strains of rats, namely spontaneously hypertensive rats and Brown Norway rats; these are parental strains of the only existing panel of recombinant inbred strains of rats. The rats were scanned in vivo at two time points (at 8 and 12 weeks of age) and ex vivo (at 12 weeks of age). We describe between-strain differences and across-time changes in brain and kidney volumes, as well as regional variations in brain structure using surface- and deformation-based approaches. We conclude by discussing the power of the population-based computational analysis of MR images, and their fusion with histology, in studies of complex traits.

We examined C10QTL2 and C17QTL to test whether they contribute to these phenotypes. In Dahl salt-sensitive, Lewis, and C10S. L16, and C17S. L2 congenic rats on a high salt diet for 8 to 10 days, blood pressure and heart rate were higher in Dahl salt-sensitive versus others and in C10S. L16 and C17S. L2 versus Lewis rats. Cerebrospinal fluid [Na+] increased by similar to 5 mmol/L in Dahl salt-sensitive, C10S. L16, and C17S. L2 compared with Lewis rats. In rats on a regular salt diet, 8-minute intracerebroventricular infusions of artificial cerebrospinal fluid with increasing [Na+] caused increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity, which were approximate to 90% larger in Dahl salt-sensitive and C17S. L2 versus Lewis rats and only 35% to 45% larger in C10S. L16 versus Lewis rats. In another set of rats on regular salt, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded by telemetry before and during intracerebroventricular infusion of Na+-rich cerebrospinal fluid for 14 days. Na+-rich cerebrospinal fluid caused significantly larger increases in blood pressure and heart rate, larger responses to air stress and more impairment of baroreflex in Dahl salt-sensitive and C17S. L2 rats versus Lewis rats. In contrast, responses in C10S. L16 rats were similar to those in Lewis rats. These data suggest that, in Dahl salt-sensitive rats, genetic variants in C10QTL2 but not C17QTL contribute to increased neuronal responsiveness to cerebrospinal fluid [Na+]. However, neither of them contributes to the increase in cerebrospinal fluid [Na+] induced by high salt.

Biomechanical studies emphasize that the motor strategies adopted by BKA adults differ between their amputated limb and their nonamputated limb and from those employed by able-bodied (AB) subjects. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the motor solutions used by control AB and BKA children during a stepping-in-place (SIP) task and to assess how they regulate the coordination of their nonamputated and amputated limbs during this task. Eight BKA children and eight AB children paired for gender, age, weight and height participated in our study. One-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were performed on peaks of angular excursion, moment, and power at the hip, knee, and ankle to compare motor strategies between the BKA and AB groups. The main results of our experiment showed that even if BKA and AB children did the task with almost the same kinematics, the kinetic data revealed completely different mechanisms of the two groups to achieve the SIP task, and BKA children had a symmetrical interlimb strategy. SIP, a simple task compared to gait at the level of neuro-musculoskeletal demands, could thus offer a transition task to physical therapists for below-knee recently-amputated children.

The case of KBCC	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMANOID ROBOTICS			English	Article						knowledge-based learning; neural networks; knowledge transfer; developmental robotics	BALANCE SCALE TASK; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; NETWORKS; RECOGNITION; RULES; ACQUISITION; RETRIEVAL; MODELS	The new field of developmental robotics faces the formidable challenge of implementing effective learning mechanisms in complex, dynamic environments. We make a case that knowledge-based learning algorithms might help to meet this challenge. A constructive neural learning algorithm, knowledge-based cascade-correlation (KBCC), autonomously recruits previously-learned networks in addition to the single hidden units recruited by ordinary cascade-correlation. This enables learning by analogy when adequate prior knowledge is available, learning by induction from examples when there is no relevant prior knowledge, and various combinations of analogy and induction. A review of experiments with KBCC indicates that recruitment of relevant existing knowledge typically speeds learning and sometimes enables learning of otherwise impossible problems. Some additional domains of interest to developmental robotics are identified in which knowledge-based learning seems essential. The characteristics of KBCC in relation to other knowledge-based neural learners and analogical reasoning are summarized as is the neurological basis for learning from knowledge. Current limitations of this approach and directions for future work are discussed.

Histone deacetylase inhibition-mediated differentiation of RGC-5 cells and interaction with survival	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							RESTRICTIVE SILENCER FACTOR; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSION; NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION; PROGENITOR CELLS; IN-VIVO; AXON; TRICHOSTATIN; NETWORKS; GROWTH	PURPOSE. The acetylation state of histones is modulated by historic deacetylase (HDAC) and histone acetyltransferase and is an important component in regulating gene transcription, including neuronal differentiation. The authors studied the relationship between histone acetylation and the differentiation and survival of the RGC-5 cell line and compared it with nontranscriptional-dependent differentiation with staurosporine. METHODS. The retinal ganglion cell line RGC-5 was treated with trichostatin A (TSA), other HDAC inhibitors, and staurosporine, differentiation, neuritogenesis, neurotrophic factor dependence, and dependence on RNA transcription were assessed. RESULTS. TSA caused significant differentiation and neuritogenesis. Differences between HDAC inhibition and staurosporine differentiation included the proportion of differentiated cells, cell viability, cell morphology, and transcriptional dependence. HDAC inhibition, but not staurosporine differentiation, resulted in RGC-5 cells that were neurotrophic factor dependent. CONCLUSIONS. These results implicate two different mechanisms for RGC-5 differentiation, with a common downstream effect on neurite outgrowth but a differential effect on neurotrophic factor dependence.

Tryptophan 32 potentiates aggregation and cytotoxicity of a copper/zinc superoxide dismutase mutant associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ADVANCED GLYCATION ENDPRODUCTS; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT COMPLEXES; CATION-PI INTERACTIONS; EXPRESSING HUMAN SOD1; MOTOR-NEURONS; CU,ZN-SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE; HYALINE INCLUSIONS; TRANSGENIC MICE; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; OXIDATIVE DAMAGE	One familial form of the neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD-1). This study provides in vivo evidence that normally occurring oxidative modification to SOD-1 promotes aggregation and toxicity of mutant proteins. The oxidation of Trp-32 was identified as a normal modification being present in both wild-type enzyme and SOD-1 with the disease-causing mutation, G93A, isolated from erythrocytes. Mutating Trp-32 to a residue with a slower rate of oxidative modification, phenylalanine, decreased both the cytotoxicity of mutant SOD-1 and its propensity to form cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons of dissociated mouse spinal cord cultures.

The role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in bimodal divided attention: Two transcranial magnetic stimulation studies	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DUAL-TASK PERFORMANCE; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL EVENTS; FRONTAL-LOBE; NEURAL BASIS; EXCITABILITY; SEGREGATION; INVOLVEMENT; PREMOTOR; REGIONS	The neural processes underlying the ability to divide attention between multiple sensory modalities remain poorly understood. To investigate the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in bimodal divided attention, we completed two repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies. We tested the hypothesis that the DLPFC is necessary in the ability to divide attention across modalities. This hypothesis originated as a result of a previous fMRI study in which the posterior DLPFC was active during a bimodal divided attention condition [Johnson,.J. A., & Zatorre, R. J. Neural substrates for dividing and focusing attention between simultaneous auditory and visual events. Neuroimage, 2006]. In the current experiments, two separate groups of subjects underwent 10 min of slow rTMS to temporarily disrupt function of the DLPFC. In both groups, the ability to divide attention between unrelated auditory and visual stimuli decreased following DLPFC disruption compared to control site stimulation. Specifically, the ability to divide attention between modalities was hindered, leading to a pattern of behavior similar to bimodal selective attention (ability to attend to one or the other modality but not both). We discuss possible roles of the posterior DLPFC in bimodal divided attention and conclude that the area may be functioning to support the increased working memory load associated with divided, compared to selective attention.

Efficient inhibition of bursts by bursts in the auditory system of crickets	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						sound localization; neural coding; bat evasion; feature detection; temporal pattern	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; INTERAURAL INTENSITY DIFFERENCES; SOUND LOCALIZATION; SUPERIOR OLIVE; NEURONS; INFORMATION; SPIKES; INPUT; BRAIN	In crickets, auditory information about ultrasound is carried bilaterally to the brain by the AN2 neurons. The ON1 neuron provides contralateral inhibitory input to AN2, thereby enhancing bilateral contrast between the left and right AN2s, an important cue for sound localization. We examine how the structures of the spike trains of these neurons affect this inhibitory interaction. As previously shown for AN2, ON1 responds to salient peaks in stimulus amplitude with bursts of spikes. Spike bursts, but not isolated spikes, reliably signal the occurrence of specific features of the stimulus. ON1 and AN2 burst at similar times relative to the amplitude envelope of the stimulus, and bursts are more tightly time-locked to stimulus feature than the isolated spikes. As a consequence, spikes that, in the absence of contralateral inhibition, would occur within AN2 bursts are more likely to be preceded by spikes in ON1 (mainly also in bursts) than are isolated AN2 spikes. This leads to a large decrease in the burst rate of the inhibited AN2. We conclude that the match in coding properties of ON1 and AN2 allows contralateral inhibition to be most efficient for those portions of the response that carry the behaviourally relevant information, i.e. for bursts.

New domains of neuroscience research and improving technological capabilities in neuroimaging have expanded the scope of studies that probe the biology of the social and ethical brain, the range of eligible volunteers for research, and the extent of academic-industry relationships. Accordingly, challenges in informed consent and subject protection are surfacing. In this context, we provide an overview of the current landscape for neuroimaging and discuss specific research ethics topics arising from it. We suggest preliminary approaches to tackle current issues, and identify areas for further collaboration between neuroimagers and institutional review boards (research ethics committee).

Episodic memory impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease is correlated with entorhinal cortex atrophy	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Alzheimer's Disease; Voxel-based morphometry; gray matter; episodic memory; entorhinal cortex	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; GRAY-MATTER LOSS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; MENTAL DETERIORATION; HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY; MRI; BRAIN; VOLUMETRY; DIAGNOSIS	The aims of this study were to investigate the pattern of cortical atrophy and the relationships between memory performances and the brain regions in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was applied to the MRI brain images of 18 probable AD and 18 healthy subjects (HS). Patients performed verbal and visuo-spatial episodic and shortterm memory tests. Contrasting of AD group with HS, and anatomobehavioural correlations were carried out in order to identify regional atrophic changes and neuro-cognitive aspects in AD group. We found evidence of gray matter (GM) volume reduction in AD in the medial temporal, parietal and frontal areas bilaterally and in the left anterior thalamic nuclei. Performance on the episodic memory delayed recall tests co-varied with GM volume in the left entorhinal cortex. The pattern of cortical atrophy likely reflects the heterogeneous level of dementia severity in our AD group. The anatomical region affected in the left hemisphere indicates a sufferance at multiple levels of the Polysynaptic Hippocampal Pathway, which is involved in declarative memory. Findings on the entorhinal cortex and the delayed memory scores support the role of the entorhinal cortex in episodic memory. Damage to the entorhinal cortex, deafferenting the hippocampus from neocortical inputs, interferes with episodic memory consolidation in AD patients.

J	Glasgow, SD; Chapman, CA				Glasgow, Stephen D.; Chapman, C. Andrew			Local generation of theta-frequency EEG activity in the parasubiculum	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL OSCILLATIONS; MEDIAL ENTORHINAL CORTEX; CURRENT-SOURCE-DENSITY; FREELY MOVING RATS; NEURONS IN-VITRO; STRATUM LACUNOSUM-MOLECULARE; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS; RHYTHMICAL SLOW ACTIVITY; LAYER-II NEURONS; SUBTHRESHOLD OSCILLATIONS	The parasubiculum is a major component of the hippocampal formation that receives inputs from the CA1 region, anterior thalamus, and medial septum and that projects primarily to layer II of the entorhinal cortex. Hippocampal theta-frequency (4-12 Hz) electroencephalographic ( EEG) activity has been correlated with sensorimotor integration, spatial navigation, and memory functions. The present study was aimed at determining if theta is also generated locally within the parasubiculum versus volume conducted from adjacent structures. In urethan-anesthetized rats, the phase-reversal of theta activity between superficial and deep layers of the parasubiculum was demonstrated using differential recordings from movable bipolar electrodes that eliminate the influence of volume-conducted activity. Parasubicular theta was abolished by atropine, and was in phase with theta in stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 region. Whole cell current-clamp recordings in brain slices were then used to determine if parasubicular theta may be generated in part by membrane potential oscillations in layer II neurons. Membrane potential oscillations occurred in most layer II neurons, including four putative interneurons, when cells were held at near-threshold voltages using current injection. The frequency of oscillations increased from 3.2 to 6.1 Hz when bath temperature was raised from 22 to 32 degrees C, and oscillations persisted in the presence of blockers of fast ionotropic glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission. Oscillations are therefore likely generated by intrinsic, voltage-dependent ionic conductances. These results indicate that theta field activity is generated locally within the parasubiculum and that intrinsic membrane potential oscillations, synchronized by local inhibitory inputs, may contribute to the generation of this activity.

J	Reboreda, A; Raouf, R; Alonso, A; Seguela, P				Reboreda, Antonio; Raouf, Ramin; Alonso, Angel; Seguela, Philippe			Development of cholinergic modulation and graded persistent activity in layer V of medial entorhinal cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS; RAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; AFTER-HYPERPOLARIZATION; FIRING PROPERTIES; NEURONS	During muscarinic modulation, principal neurons from layer V of rat medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) respond to repeated applications of a brief stimulus with a graded change in persistent firing frequency. This pattern of discharge has been proposed to represent an intrinsic mechanism for short-term memory operations. To investigate the implementation of persistent activity in mEC during development, we characterized the electrophysiological properties of layer V principal neurons in the mEC over a range of postnatal stages. We observed significant differences in both passive ( resistance, time constant, and resting membrane potential) and active properties ( threshold, action potential, and adaptation) of principal neurons from rats aged 5-7, 10-13, 16-19, and 21-23 days. We also examined the properties of muscarinic-dependent persistent activity in EC slices from different age groups. Recordings were conducted using the perforated-patch whole cell technique because persistent activity runs down in the ruptured-patch configuration. Although no neuron in the youngest group exhibited graded persistent activity in response to muscarinic receptor activation, this activity was recorded in the 10- to 13-day-old group and its occurrence increased from 69% in the 16- to 19-day-old group to 76% in the 21- to 23-day-old group. This postnatal increase in neurons endowed with persistent firing properties in mEC was found to parallel the increase in density of ChAT-positive immunostaining of fibers and the developmental changes in M1 muscarinic receptor mRNA levels. All these data suggest that the implementation of mnemonic properties in mEC principal neurons matches the ontogenic development of afferent cholinergic circuits and their signaling components.

Vestibular system may provide equivalent motor actions regardless of the number of body segments involved in the task	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIAL LONGITUDINAL FASCICULUS; ACOUSTIC NEUROMA SURGERY; ARM-REACHING MOVEMENTS; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; VESTIBULOSPINAL TRACT; MEMBRANE-PROPERTIES; TRUNK COORDINATION; POINTING MOVEMENTS; DEFECTIVE PATIENTS; POSTURAL CONTROL	The vestibulospinal system likely plays an essential role in motor equivalence-the ability to reach the desired motor goal despite intentional or imposed changes in the number of body segments involved in the task. To test this hypothesis, we compared the ability of healthy subjects and patients with unilateral vestibular lesions ( surgical acoustic neuroma resection 0.6 to 6.7 yr before the study) to maintain either the same hand position or the same trajectory of within arm reach movements while flexing the trunk, in the absence of vision. In randomly selected trials, the trunk motion was prevented by an electromagnetic device. Healthy subjects were able to preserve the hand position or trajectory by modifying the elbow and shoulder joint rotations in a condition-dependent way, at a minimal latency of about 60 ms after the trunk movement onset. In contrast, six of seven patients showed deficits in the compensatory angular modifications at least in one of two tasks so that 30-100% of the trunk displacement was not compensated and thus influenced the hand position or trajectory. Results suggest that vestibular influences evoked by the head motion during trunk flexion play a major role in maintaining the consistency of arm motor actions in external space despite changes in the number of body segments involved. Our findings also suggest that despite long-term plasticity in the vestibular system and related neural structures, unilateral vestibular lesion may reduce the capacity of the nervous system to achieve motor equivalence.

Stimulating through chronically implanted nerve cuffs ensured a stable stimulation over time. The increase in reflex amplitude was well above the small increase in the amplitude of the locomotor bursts themselves that results from the denervation. Short latency responses (P1) were seen in flexor muscles, especially at the knee ( semitendinosus) and ankle ( tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus), with stimuli applied in the swing phase and also to a lesser degree in the later part of the cycle. Longer latency responses (P2) were increased in hip, knee, and ankle flexors, as well as in a contralateral extensor ( vastus lateralis) when applied in late stance. Responses evoked from stimulating the proximal end of sectioned nerves were not larger than before neurectomy. This suggests that the increased responsiveness to Tib stimulation is not simply caused by an increase in motoneuron excitability, because this would have resulted in a nonspecific increase of responses to stimulation of any nerve. It is concluded that the adult locomotor system is capable of central reorganization to enhance specific remaining cutaneous reflex pathways after a partial cutaneous denervation of the paw.

Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) has been shown to provide considerable benefit to children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). The authors sought to evaluate the risks of postoperative spinal deformities in patients following SDR. Methods. All patients who underwent SDR at McGill University between 1991 and 2001 were identified. Hospital charts and radiographic spinal studies (both preoperative and the latest postoperative) were systematically reviewed. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to test all independent variables of potential interest to determine risk factors more likely to be associated with spinal deformity. There were 98 patients whose mean age at surgery was 5.1 years; the mean radiographic follow-up duration was 5.8 years. Thirty-nine (44.8%) of 87 patients in whom postoperative weight-bearing radiographs were obtained had mild scoliosis, and 17 in whom standing radiographs were acquired had hyperlordosis. In all, 18 of 94 patients (19.1 %) who had postoperative radiographs on which the lumbosacral junction was visible were found to have spondylolisthesis. Regression analysis identified the severity of preoperative CP as an important predictor, and less ambulatory patients were more likely to have scoliotic curves. Younger age at surgery and male sex were factors associated with a lower rate of hyperlordosis. Spondylolisthesis developed only in ambulatory children. None of the patients experienced clinically significant deficits. Conclusions. There was a high rate of radiologically documented deformities in patients with CP who underwent SDR. Ambulatory function, CP severity, age at surgery, and sex may be contributing factors.

The goal of this study was to validate the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) in French-speaking veterans suffering from PTSD (n = 130). We administered the BPI, as well as measures of PTSD, health status, quality of of, and social desirability, to veterans being assessed or treated,for PTSD at a Veterans Affairs Canada clinic. The BPI showed strong internal consistency, as evidenced by Cronbach's alphas of 0.90 and 0.92 for the severity and interference subscales, respectively. Similar to previous findings, a two-factor structure (pain severity and pain interference) was found using an exploralory factor analysis. The two factors explained nearly 73 % of the variance of the instrument. The BPI was also strongly correlated with health status and quality of life in the physical domain. In this veteran sample, nearly 87% of the veterans suffered from significant current pain. Veterans in our sample reported rates of pain severity that were similar to or higher than most of those reported by cancer patients and others with significant physical disability/illness. Overall, the French version of the BPI is a reliable, valid measure of pain in PTSD-suffering populations. Pain is a major issue in veterans with PTSD, and should be screened for with instruments such as the BPI.

Methods: A retrospective review of the hospital charts of patients with neuromuscular scoliosis who underwent surgical correction at a medical center was performed. Results: Data was available on a total of 175 patients. The overall perioperative complication rate was 33.1% (96 complications in 58 patients). Complications were subdivided into pulmonary issues (19.4%), wound and implant infections (9.7%), cardiovascular complications (4.0%), intraoperative neurological changes (4.6%), miscellaneous complications (5.7%), and problematic instrumentation (3.4%). No patient had an identifiable permanent postoperative change in neurological status. The complication rate in patients who underwent single-stage procedures (37.4%) was found lower than that in patients who underwent staged procedures (57.1%). There were no deaths during the perioperative period. Conclusions: Patients with neuromuscular scoliosis are at high risk of developing perioperative complications after surgical correction of their deformity (overall rate, 33.1%).

Nonetheless, controversy remains about the causal nature of the association. This review takes the debate further through a critical appraisal of the evidence. An electronic search was performed, allowing to identify 622 studies published until June 1st 2005. Longitudinal studies and literature reviews were selected if they addressed specifically the issues of the cannabis/psychosis relationship or possible mechanisms involved. Ten epidemiological studies were relevant: three supported a causal relationship between cannabis use and diagnosed psychosis; five suggested that chronic cannabis intake increases the frequency of psychotic symptoms, but not of diagnosed psychosis; and two showed no causal relationship. Potential neurobiological mechanisms were also identified, involving dopamine, endocannabinoids, and brain growth factors. Although there is evidence that cannabis use increases the risk of developing psychotic symptoms, the causal nature of this association remains unclear. Contributing factors include heavy consumption, length and early age of exposure, and psychotic vulnerability. This conclusion should be mitigated by uncertainty arising from cannabis use assessment, psychosis measurement, reverse causality and control of residual confounding.

Two illustrations are provided which demonstrate the incorporation of empirical data into the modeling of behavioral responses to situations varying in closeness and hierarchical role relationships. An event-contingent recording procedure is utilized to obtain data from the same participant in multiple events for multiple situations. This data is then used in the training and validation of the neural networks. The first illustration models dominant and submissive behaviors in response to situations varying in social role status. The second illustration models agreeable and quarrelsome behaviors in response to situations varying in closeness and gender of the interaction partner. The predictions from both neural network models are consistent with previous research. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

MEND-CABG Investigators	Effects of pyridoxal-5 '-phosphate (MC-1) in patients undergoing high-risk coronary artery bypass surgery: Results of the MEND-CABG randomized study	JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article							MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; GRAFT-SURGERY; PYRIDOXAL 5'-PHOSPHATE; ISCHEMIC-INJURY; FOLLOW-UP; TRIAL; SURVIVAL; REVASCULARIZATION; COMPLICATIONS; ANTAGONIST	Objective: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery remains associated with significant postoperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients. MC-1 (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate monohydrate) inhibits purinergic receptors and intracellular influx of Ca2+, thereby reducing cellular injury during experimental ischemia and reperfusion. The MEND-CABG trial tested the hypothesis that MC-1 reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft. Methods: In a phase 2, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 901 patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and at high risk for subsequent cardiac or neurologic complications were randomly assigned to receive oral MC-1 (250 mg or 750 mg/d once daily) or placebo beginning 3 to 10 hours prior to surgery and continued to postoperative day 30. Results: At 30 days, MC-I 250 mg (compared with placebo) reduced the composite of death, nonfatal cerebral infarction, and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 14.0% (P =.3124) with peak creatinine kinase-myocardial band >= 50 ng/mL (prespecified primary end point); 32.3% (P =.0349) with peak creatinine kinase-myocardial band >= 70 ng/mL; and 37.2% (P =.0283) with peak creatinine kinase-myocardial band >= 100 ng/mL. Myocardial infarctions with peak creatinine kinase-myocardial band >= 100 ng/mL were reduced by 47.2% in the MC-1 250-mg group versus placebo (P =.0083). Greater efficacy was demonstrated with 250 mg than with the 750-mg dose of MC-1. Conclusions: In high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft, treatment with MC-1 did not significantly affect the prespecified primary end point but was associated with a significant reduction in perioperative myocardial infarction with creatinine kinase-myocardial band -100 ng/mL. A larger, well-powered trial is needed to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of MC-1.

Cortical morphology in children and adolescents with different apolipoprotein E gene polymorphisms: an observational study	LANCET NEUROLOGY			English	Article							AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE DECLINE; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; EPSILON-4 ALLELE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MRI DATA; RISK	Background Alleles of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene modulate risk for Alzheimer's disease, with carriers of the epsilon 4 allele being at increased risk and carriers of the epsilon 2 allele possibly at decreased risk compared with non-carriers. Our aim was to determine whether possession of an epsilon 4 allele would confer children with a neural substrate that might render them at risk for Alzheimer's disease, and whether carriers of the epsilon 2 allele might have a so-called protective cortical morphology. Methods 239 healthy children and adolescents were genotyped and had repeated neuroanatomic MRI (total 530 scans). Mixed model regression was used to determine whether the developmental trajectory of the cortex differed by genotype. Findings Cortical thickness of the left entorhinal region was significantly thinner in epsilon 4 carriers than it was in non-epsilon 4 carriers (3 center dot 79 [SE 0 center dot 06] mm, range 1 center dot 54-5 center dot 24 vs 3 center dot 94 [0 center dot 03) mm, 2 center dot 37-6 center dot 11; p=0 center dot 03). There was a significant stepwise increase in cortical thickness in the left entorhinal regions, with epsilon 4 carriers having the thinnest cortex and epsilon 2 carriers the thickest, with epsilon 3 homozygotes occupying an intermediate position (left beta 0 center dot 11 [SE 0 center dot 05], p=0 center dot 02). Neuroanatomic effects seemed fixed and non-progressive, with no evidence of accelerated cortical loss in young healthy epsilon 4 carriers. Interpretation Alleles of the apolipoprotein E gene have distinct neuroanatomic signatures, identifiable in childhood. The thinner entorhinal cortex in individuals with the epsilon 4 allele might contribute to risk of Alzheimer's disease.

In this paper, we model birth weight as a first hitting time (FHT) of a birthing boundary in a Wiener process representing fetal development. We associate the parameters of the process and boundary with covariates describing maternal characteristics and the birthing environment using a relatively new regression methodology called threshold regression. Two FHT models for birth weight are developed. One is a mixture model and the other a competing risks model. These models are tested in a case demonstration using a 4%-systematic sample of the more than four million live births in the United States in 2002. An extensive data set for these births was provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. The focus of this paper is on the conceptual framework, models and methodology. A full empirical study is deferred to a later occasion.

Cotransmission can therefore be considered the rule rather than the exception. Indeed, cotransmission of a classical neurotransmitter and a peptide is a ubiquitous phenomenon, but several neuron types can also contain more than one classical neurotransmitter [glutamate, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, dopamine, etc.]. Although the expression of peptide cotransmitters is known to be highly regulated in response to various physiological, chemical and pathological signals, new data now suggest that a similar situation prevails in neurons that co-release two classical transmitters. In this review we will consider a number of recently described examples of cotransmission implicating more than one classical neurotransmitter. We will also consider new data showing that during development and later in adulthood, as well as in the context of disease, the neurotransmitter phenotype of neurons can be highly plastic as revealed by changes in the expression of neurotransmitter synthesis enzymes and vesicular neurotransmitter transporters.

Ankle position and voluntary contraction alter maximal M waves in soleus and tibialis anterior	MUSCLE & NERVE			English	Article						compound muscle action potential; contraction level; muscle length; M-wave; reflex	SURFACE MYOELECTRIC SIGNALS; H-REFLEX; TRICEPS SURAE; JOINT POSITION; MUSCLE LENGTH; GASTROCNEMIUS-MUSCLE; HUMANS; POTENTIALS; AMPLITUDE; WALKING	Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) recorded using surface electrodes are often used to assess the excitability of neural pathways to skeletal muscle. However, the amplitude of CMAPs can be influenced by changes at the recording site, independent of mechanisms within the central nervous system. We quantified how joint angle and background contraction influenced CMAP amplitude. In seven subjects CMAPs evoked by supramaximal transcutaneous electrical stimulation of motor axons (M-max) were recorded using surface electrodes from soleus and tibialis anterior (TA) at static positions over the full range of ankle movement at 5 degrees intervals. Across subjects the peak-to-peak amplitude of Mmax was 155% and 159% larger at the shortest than longest muscle lengths for soleus and TA, respectively. In five subjects the effect of ankle position and voluntary contraction on M-wave/H-reflex recruitment curves was assessed in the soleus. Both ankle position and level of contraction significantly influenced M-max, H-max, and the H-max to M-max ratio, but there were no interactions between the two parameters. These peripheral changes that influence Mmax will also impact other CMAPs such as submaximal M-waves, H-reflexes, and responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation. As such, during experimental studies CMAPs evoked at a given joint angle and contraction level should be normalized to M-max recorded at similar joint angle and contraction strength.

Soluble expanded PABPN1 promotes cell death in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article							NUCLEAR POLY(A)-BINDING PROTEIN; UBIQUITIN-PROTEASOME PATHWAY; CONJUGATING ENZYME CDC34; INCLUSION-BODY FORMATION; MUTANT HUNTINGTIN; TRANSGENIC MICE; POLY(A) RNA; BINDING; POLYGLUTAMINE; EXPANSIONS	Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by the expansion of a polyalanine repeat (GCG)(8-13) in exon 1 of the PABPN1 gene. Skeletal muscle fibers nuclei from OPMD patients contain insoluble polyalanine expanded PABPN1 (expPABPN1) nuclear aggregates that sequester different cellular components. Whether these aggregates are pathogenic, or the consequence of a molecular defense mechanism, remains controversial in the field of neurodegenerative disorders and OPMD. Our cellular model shows that interfering with the formation of expPABPN-Iinduced large nuclear aggregates increases the availability of nuclear expPABPN1 and significantly exacerbates cell death. Live microscopy reveals that cells harboring an increased amount of the soluble forms of expPABPN1 are significantly more prone to toxicity than those with nuclear aggregates. This is the first report directly indicating that nuclear aggregation in OPMD may reflect an active process by which cells sequester and inactivate the soluble toxic form of expPABPN1.

Neuropsychological tests that are sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced cognitive impairments revealed global cognitive deficits consistent with primary hippocampal and prefrontal cortical dysfunction. The patient has a fraternal twin brother, who had previously achieved academic milestones in parallel with him; the patient began falling behind his twin in academic, developmental and social areas shortly after the steroid treatment. In the 3 years since stopping steroid medication, the patient has shown gradual but possibly incomplete resolution of his cognitive deficits. Quantitative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed 38 months after steroid exposure revealed no gross abnormalities, but the patient's hippocampal volume was 19.5% smaller than that of his twin, despite the patient having a larger overall intracranial volume. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, performed at the same time, suggested subtly decreased activity in the left posterior frontal and left parietal lobes. This case, along with others reported in the literature, suggests that certain individuals develop a "steroid dementia syndrome" after glucocorticoid treatment. Although this syndrome is uncommon, it is consistent with evolving theories of the neurotoxic or neuroendangering potential of glucocorticoids in some situations.

The failure in NGF maturation and its increased degradation as the probable cause for the vulnerability of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's disease	NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; pro-NGF; NGF; metalloprotease; cholinergic neurons; trophic factor; neurodegeneration	NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; FACTOR MESSENGER-RNA; BASAL FOREBRAIN; SENILE DEMENTIA; BRAIN; RAT; RELEASE; CORTEX; PRONGF; DEATH	This short review discusses the arguments to consider the dismetabolism of the pathway responsible for both the maturation and degradation of NGF as the culprit of vulnerability of the forebrain cholinergic system to the Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. This summary includes information regarding a novel metabolic cascade converting Pro-NGF to mature NGF in the extracellular space and its ultimate degradation by a metalloprotease. It also describes how this pathway is altered in Alzheimer's disease with the consequential CNS accumulation of proNGF and impairment in the formation of NGF along with increased degradation of this key trophic factor. This metabolic scenario in Alzheimer's disease should result in the failure of NGF trophic support to forebrain cholinergic neurons and thus explaining the vulnerability of these neurons in this neurodegenerative condition.

Hyperglycemia occurring during experimental and clinical stroke has been associated with increased cerebral damage. Increased oxidative stress resulting from hyperglycemia is believed to contribute to the exacerbated damage. More specifically, superoxide, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite are believed to play an important role in cerebral damage. This also involves increased recruitment of various blood cells to the ischemic zone that contribute to inflammation. We present data from our group and others that demonstrate that free radical production is increased during hyperglycemic stroke in rodents. Recent data suggest that inflammation is an important component of ischemic damage under both normo- and hyperglycemic conditions. We summarize numerous studies that indicate that a variety of antioxidant (inhibition of free radical production, scavenging of free radicals and increasing free radical degradation) and anti-inflammatory strategies decrease cerebral infarction. Finally, we compare the success of some of these strategies in clinical trials compared to the animal models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the development of effective clinical treatments for this potentially devastating condition has been largely unsuccessful to date, despite promising basic research. This review will focus on the latest advances in our understanding of the excitotoxic process including the release of glutamate as a neurotransmitter and the potential contribution of complexins, the important role of astrocytes, including its involvement in glutamate uptake, alterations in glutamate transporter levels, reversed glutamate uptake, and the vesicular release of glutamate. Recent progress in our understanding of the involvement of excitotoxicity in white matter injury following ischemic insults is also discussed, as is oxidative stress and ischemic tolerance, along with an update on the use of treatment strategies with potential therapeutic benefit including stimulation of neurogenesis. Such key issues are at the heart of future interventions directed at limiting the extent of the excitotoxic process, and remain a viable consideration for effective stroke management.

Parameter estimation in single-compartment neuron models using a synchronization-based method	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting	JUL, 2006	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND			single-compartment model; parameter optimization; Hodgkin-Huxley model; synchronized dynamics		We describe a method for estimating parameter values in single-compartment neuron models from a recorded voltage trace. The technique involves synchronization between the model and the experimental data and minimizing a cost function that depends on the goodness of this synchrony with a minimum for optimal parameter values. We test our method using a previously developed single-compartment interneuron model that includes noise to mimic experimental data. Direct computation of the cost function over ranges of parameter values suggests that it changes smoothly, allowing for downhill optimization routines that utilize the gradient. We implement one such optimization routine with several kinetic parameters set at incorrect values. The optimization is fast and consistently returns good values. We discuss the considerations necessary when applying this approach to noisy data. In conclusion, we believe that this approach will be a useful toot in developing neuronal models.

Amygdala responses to nonlinguistic emotional vocalizations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review							HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURAL RESPONSES; BRAIN ACTIVATION; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; INTACT RECOGNITION; VOCAL EXPRESSIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; STIMULI; FMRI	Whereas there is ample evidence for a role of the amygdala in the processing of visual emotional stimuli, particularly those with negative value, discrepant results have been reported regarding amygdala responses to emotional auditory stimuli. The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate cerebral activity underlying processing of emotional nonlinguistic vocalizations, with a particular focus on neural changes in the amygdala. Fourteen healthy volunteers were scanned while performing a gender identification task. Stimuli, previously validated on emotional valence, consisted of positive (happiness and sexual pleasure) and negative (sadness and fear) vocalizations, as well as emotionally neutral sounds (e.g., coughs). Results revealed bilateral amygdala activation in response to all emotional vocalizations when compared to neutral stimuli. These findings suggest that the generally accepted involvement of the amygdala in the perception of emotional visual stimuli, such as facial expressions, also applies to stimuli within the auditory modality. Importantly, this amygdala response was observed for both positive and negative emotional vocalizations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A trainable feature extractor based on the LeNet5 convolutional neural network architecture is introduced to solve the first problem in a black box scheme without prior knowledge on the data. The classification task is performed by support vector machines to enhance the generalization ability of LeNet5. In order to increase the recognition rate, new training samples are generated by affine transformations and elastic distortions. Experiments are performed on the well-known MNIST database to validate the method and the results show that the system can outperform both SVMs and LeNet5 while providing performances comparable to the best performance on this database. Moreover, an analysis of the errors is conducted to discuss possible means of enhancement and their limitations. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lima, CAD; Leibing, A; Buschfort, R				De Mendonca Lima, Carlos A.; Leibing, Annette; Buschfort, Ruediger			Mental health resources for older persons in the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization	PSYCHOGERIATRICS			English	Review						mental health in old age; mental health resources; WPRO		Background: The Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) contains 27% of the world population and 29% of the world population of elderly people: it is the oldest among the six WHO regions. The demographic transition (from high child mortality and low life expectancy to a low child mortality and high life expectancy) is happening at high speed and this proportion of the world's elderly population is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. Consequently, there is a high risk that the number of older persons with mental disorders will significantly increase. To better understand the organization of care for older persons, data is being collected to reduce the imbalance between 'disease information' and 'resource information'-information that addresses older persons' needs in terms of mental health care. This article presents some results for this region. Method: Data were essentially collected from the World Health Report 2005. The data concerning NGOs was obtained at the websites of the World Psychiatric Association, the World Federation of Neurology, the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics and Alzheimer's Disease International (ADI). Results: Because the mental health problems of older adults is still not a public health priority, the careful examination of individual countries nevertheless reveals certain specificities, such as divergent life expectancy or different values regarding aging. The authors present some recommendations for the development of care for elderly persons with mental disorders in the region based on the general recommendations made by WHO in the World Health Report 2001 (WHR 2001) and by WHO and the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) in some consensus statements on Psychiatry of the Elderly. Conclusion: The Western Pacific WHO region has a high proportion of older persons in its population (11.2% of total population), with important differences between the countries in life expectancy at birth. Strong cultural forces and migration may affect the growing and aging processes. Local poverty, with all the consequences it may have for health, may also be an important factor negatively influencing quality of life and life expectancy at birth. Mental health for all ages should become a priority issue in the public agenda in the region. National governments should make efforts to promote mental health and provide care for elderly persons with mental disorders, depending on local resources and cultures. As mental disorders in old age can represent a severe limitation on quality of life for older persons and their families good care should be extended to all concerned. The challenge of finding solutions for better living conditions for older people with mental health problems lies in the hands of researchers, policy makers and the population. Funding and creativity are two factors necessary to find such solutions.

J	Orlov, SN				Orlov, Sergei N.			On the history of ecto-ATPases: The role of W. A. Engelhardt	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article							ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE; PYROPHOSPHATE; ERYTHROCYTES; TRANSMITTER; NERVES; CELLS	The concept of purinergic signalling is based on three key observations. (1) In 1929, Drury and Szent-Gyorgyi crystallized the physiologically active substance and concluded that it was adenylic acid. They also reported that this substance, nowadays referred to as AMP, affects contraction of the mammalian heart and blood vessels [1]. After more than a 20-year lag phase, the actions of extracellular purines were confirmed in all types of cells studied so far (for more details, see [2]). (2) In the early 1970s, Burnstock and co-workers demonstrated that "non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic" regulation of smooth muscle contraction was mediated by ATP as a co-neurotransmitter [3-5]. (3) Since the early 1990s, four P1, seven P2X and eight P2Y receptors have been identified and functionally characterized [6]. At the same time, more than ten ectonucleotidases, including ecto-ATPases, were cloned from the mammalian genome [7, 8]. These enzymes protect purinoceptors from desensitization and downregulation via the rapid normalization of extracellular nucleotide concentration and may be considered as analogues of acetylcholine esterase and Na(+)-coupled noradrenaline transporter in cholinergic and adrenergic signalling, respectively.

Ultrasound (US) has been established as an excellent diagnostic modality for foot and ankle injuries, providing a rapid noninvasive, economical, and readily available tool that is well tolerated by the patient with acute or chronic pain. The opportunity for dynamic examination is another advantage of US in evaluating ankle and foot pathology, where maneuvers such as muscle contraction and stressing of the joint may be particularly helpful. In many cases, US can be used as a first-line and only imaging modality for diagnosis. This article focuses on ankle disorders related to sports or overuse that affect tendons, including tendinosis, tenosynovitis, paratendinitis, rupture, dislocation, and. ligaments that are commonly torn. The sonographic features of certain common foot disorders related to physical activity and overuse are also discussed, including plantar fasciitis, Morton's neuroma, stress fractures, and plantar plate injury.

J	Joyal, CC; Black, DN; Dassylva, B				Joyal, Christian C.; Black, Deborah N.; Dassylva, Benoit			The neuropsychology and neurology of sexual deviance: A review and pilot study	SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT			English	Review						sexual deviance; pedophilia; rape; neurology; neuropsychology	SORTING TEST-PERFORMANCE; TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; EDUCATIONAL-LEVEL; NORMATIVE DATA; BRAIN; HYPERSEXUALITY; PEDOPHILIA; AGE; TRANSVESTISM	Current neurological hypotheses of paraphilia posit that sexual deviance is associated with frontal and/or temporal lobe damage. This broad conception is based on few investigations, however, and the first goal of this study was to review the existing data derived from neuropsychiatry, neuroimaging and neuropsychology. It is concluded that although fronto-temporal dysfunctions are sporadically reported among sexual offenders, the evidence is scarce and it might not be specific to this type of offending. The second objective of this investigation was to gather preliminary neuropsychological data with more homogeneous subgroups of sexual offenders. A profile of lower-order executive dysfunctions (e.g. sustained attention and inhibition) and verbal deficits with intact or good capacities for higher-order executive functioning (e.g. reasoning and cognitive flexibility) and visuo-spatial processing was preferentially found among sexual offenders, suggesting basal fronto-temporal anomalies. Importantly, pedophiles were more consistently and severely impaired than rapists of adults. However, this basal fronto-temporal profile is not characteristic of sexual deviance, as it is also found in association with delinquency and criminality in general. Future neuropsychological and brain imaging studies should consider subgroups of sexual offenders and recruit non-sexual violent persons and non-violent individuals in order to disentangle the complex relations between brain anomalies and sexual deviance.

Indeed, human brain activity during sleep is segregated within specific cortical and subcortical areas in relation to the sleep stage, sleep physiological events and previous waking activity. This approach has allowed sleep physiological theories developed from animal data to be confirmed, but has also introduced original concepts about the neurobiological mechanisms of sleep, dreams and memory in humans. In contrast, at present, few neuroimaging studies have been dedicated to human sleep disorders. The available work has brought interesting data that describe some aspects of the pathophysiology and neural consequences of disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea and narcolepsy. However, the interpretation of many of these results is restricted by limited sample size and spatial/temporal resolution of the employed technique. The use of neuromiaging in sleep medicine is actually restrained by concerns resulting from the technical experimental settings and the characteristics of the diseases. Nevertheless, we predict that future studies, conducted with state of the art techniques on larger numbers of patients, will be able to address these issues and contribute significantly to the understanding of the neural basis of sleep pathologies. This may finally offer the opportunity to use neuroirnaging, in addition to the clinical and electrophysiological assessments, as a helpful tool in the diagnosis, classification, treatment and monitoring of sleep disorders in humans.

The negative consequences of substance abuse in schizophrenia are well documented, but the aetiology of this comorbid condition remains unknown. Mounting evidence suggests that dual-diagnosis patients have fewer negative symptoms and better social skills, compared to non-abusing patients. We hypothesized that schizophrenia patients with substance use disorder (SCZ-SUD) would display increased cerebral activations in response to socioemotional stimuli, relative to patients with no SUD (SCZ). Schizophrenia patients (DSM-IV criteria) were divided into two groups: patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 11) substance use (alcohol and/or cannabis). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), patients were scanned during passive viewing of an emotional film excerpt with social content. Loci of activation were identified in the right mPFC (BA 10) and the right supramarginal gyrus (BA 40) in SCZ-SUD patients, and in the left pons in SCZ patients. Relative to SCZ patients, increased loci of activation were found in the right superior parietal cortex (BA 7) and the left medial prefrontal cortex (BA 10) in SCZ-SUD patients, who reported higher subjective emotional experience on a self-report scale. To our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study to assess social emotions in dual-diagnosis schizophrenia. Our results suggest that socioemotional processing may be less impaired in dual diagnosis, which recruited brain regions seemingly involved in "social cognition." Further studies on the topic are warranted.

In the present paper, an SSLR analysis is applied to the results of a survey that used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) to identify depressive symptoms in a group of Japanese workers in an attempt to determine score categories that have predictive clinical values in a screening context. Methods The self-reported CES-D and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) were administered to 2,219 workers (84.2% men; age 21-68 years) during a periodical medical examination. The SSLR was calculated to determine strata with optimal discrimination for major depressive disorder (MDD). Results For MDD, the SSLR was 0.06 (95%CI: 0.02-0.18) for the CES-D score range 0-16, 1.90 (0.78-4.62) for the score range 17-19, and 12.4 (10.2-15.1) for the score above 20. Conclusions The SSLR shown in this study proposes score categories that guide clinicians in selecting the workers most at risks of having MDD among Japanese workers.

In this paper, we test the hypotheses, derived from past research, that having a positive family history of a psychotic disorder in first or second degree relatives will be associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), but a longer duration of untreated illness (DUI). Data were derived from 169 patients who presented for treatment to a first episode psychotic disorders program. Information was collected concerning family history, DUP, DUI and the timing of family recognition of the need for help. Results The findings failed to confirm a positive family history being associated with shorter DUP, but did support the prediction of such a history being related to longer DUI. Paradoxically, given the. latter findings, families with a history of psychotic illness were more likely to recognize the need for help for the ill person prior to the onset of psychotic symptoms. The difference in DUI appears to reflect the presence of a longer period of early signs prior to the emergence of psychosis in those cases with a positive family history. Conclusions These findings suggest the importance of examining family history as a possible confound of any relationship between DUI and long-term course of illness.

J	Hanna, AM; Ural, D; Saygili, G				Hanna, Adel M.; Ural, Derin; Saygili, Gokhan			Neural network model for liquefaction potential in soil deposits using Turkey and Taiwan earthquake data	SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article						liquefaction; general regression neural networks; GRNN; Kocaeli earthquake; Taiwan earthquake; standard penetration test	RESISTANCE	Simplified methods have been practiced by researchers to assess nonlinear liquefaction potential of soil. Derived from several field and laboratory tests, various simplified procedures such as stress-based, strain-based, Chinese criteria, etc. have been developed by utilizing case studies and undisturbed soil specimens. In order to address the collective knowledge built up in conventional liquefaction engineering, an alternative general regression neural network model is proposed in this paper. To meet this objective, a total of 620 sets of data including 12 soil and seismic parameters are introduced into the model. The data includes the results of field tests from the two major earthquakes that took place in Turkey and Taiwan in 1999 and some of the desired input parameters are obtained from correlations existing in the literature. The proposed GRNN model was developed in four phases, mainly: identification phase, collection phase, implementation phase, and verification phase. An iterative procedure was followed to maximize the accuracy of the proposed model. The case records were divided randomly into testing, training, and validation datasets. Generating a model that takes into account of 12 soil and seismic parameters is not feasible by using simplified techniques; however, the proposed GRNN model effectively explored the complex relationship between the introduced soil and seismic input parameters and validated the liquefaction decision obtained by simplified methods. The proposed GRNN model predicted well the occurrence/nonoccurrence of soil liquefaction in these sites. The model provides a viable tool to geotechnical engineers in assessing seismic condition in sites susceptible to liquefaction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Endoscopic pituitary surgery with and without image guidance: an experimental comparison	SURGICAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						actual visual accuracy; endoscopic pituitary surgery; image guidance	ENDONASAL TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY; ELECTROMAGNETIC TRACKING SYSTEM; COMPUTER-ASSISTED SURGERY; ANTERIOR SKULL BASE; SINUS SURGERY; TECHNICAL NOTE; SELLA TURCICA; GLAND	Background: The combination of image guidance and endoscopy is the newest trend in pituitary surgery. To assess the impact of image guidance on EPS, we measured and calculated the accuracy of the system and compared some critical surgical steps with and without image guidance under experimental conditions in terms of surgical time and precision. Methods: Twenty cadaver heads were explored by standard endoscopic transsphenoidal surgical technique. Optic-radio logic correlations of topographic landmarks were photographed, and the system accuracy and actual visual accuracy were recorded. Some important anatomical parameters were measured in surgical field and on navigation system, and the differences were calculated and analyzed. Some critical surgical steps were recorded and compared between with and without image guidance. Results: The system accuracy (root mean square), calculated by the computer automatically, showed a mean value of 0.28 +/- 0.06 mm. In some cases, there was a small discrepancy between the visible position of the pointer and its counterpart on the navigation system; we coined this actual visual accuracy. The average value was 1.53 +/- 0.49 mm. The maximum difference between the measurements from the navigation system and from their actual visual counterparts was less than 7%. With and without image guidance, in normal anatomical conditioning, there was no statistically significant difference between the duration of ostium sphenoidale exposure and sellar window creation; however, in anatomical variations, the surgical time was shown to be significantly shorter when navigation was used. Conclusion: We have demonstrated in this experimental setting that the electromagnetic tracking image guidance possesses a high accuracy at millimetric level and therefore provides precise localization and orientation in EPS. With the assistance of neuronavigation system, it is advantageous not only in saving operating time, but also, more importantly, in enhancing the orientation, thus, rendering surgeries safer and more efficient. During the in vivo pituitary surgery, EPS with image guidance can provide accurate and reliable stereoinformation to achieve better results with lesser risks, particularly in complex cases or in reoperations, even in the hands of experienced surgeons.

Here, a theoretical framework is proposed to account for experimental results specifying the role of presynaptic activation, postsynaptic activation, and concentrations of extracellular DA in synaptic plasticity. Our starting point was an explicitly-implemented multiplicative rule linking STDP to Michaelis-Menton equations that models the dynamics of extracellular DA fluctuations. This rule captures a wide range of results on conditions leading to long-term potentiation and depression in simulations that manipulate the frequency of induced corticostriatal stimulation and DA release. A well-documented biphasic function relating DA concentrations to synaptic plasticity emerges naturally from simulations involving a multiplicative rule linking DA and neural activity. This biphasic function is found consistently across different neural coding schemes employed (voltage-based vs. spike-based models). By comparison, an additive rule fails to capture these results. The proposed framework is the first to generate testable predictions on the dual influence of DA concentrations and STDP on long-term plasticity, suggesting a way in which the biphasic influence of DA concentrations can modulate the direction and magnitude of change induced by STDP, and raising the possibility that DA concentrations may inverse the LTP/LTD components of the STDP rule.

Although topography is often found in projections from peripheral sense organs to the brain, it also seems to participate in the anatomical and functional organization of higher brain centers, for reasons that are poorly understood. We propose that a key function of topography might be to provide computational underpinnings for precise one-to-one correspondences between abstract cognitive representations. This perspective offers a novel conceptualization of how the brain approaches difficult problems, such as reasoning and analogy making, and suggests that a broader understanding of topographic maps could be pivotal in fostering strong links between genetics, neurophysiology and cognition.

Maturation profile for both stimuli was similar in the control group. Strabismic infants showed a vertical offset in maturation, which affected the second-order more severely. The pre-term group showed a lag of second-order sensitivity. Our results underline differences between first- and second-order processing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In intermediate areas, such as area V4, responses are driven by features more complex than local oriented edges but more basic than meaningful shapes. The present study was motivated by the proposal that concentric (circular) shape processing is an important aspect of intermediate shape processing and is proposed to occur in area V4. However, previous studies are not able to discriminate between the number of orientations within the image nor how these orientations vary across space (orientation gradient, contrast or curvature) as opposed to concentric shape processing per se. We address the question whether V4 responses are driven by curvature or circularity. We use fMRI and tightly controlled narrowband stimuli with identical local and global properties. These patterns either form random or circular patterns with tightly matched orientation gradients and therefore similar curvature.

Binocular influences on global motion processing in the human visual system	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						global motion; optic flow; contrast; binocular summation; dichoptic interaction	AREA MT; FIRST-ORDER; COHERENCE THRESHOLDS; TRANSPARENT-MOTION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; OPTIC FLOW; FELLOW EYE; PERCEPTION; MONKEY; DISPARITY	This study investigates four key issues concerning the binocular properties of the mechanisms that encode global motion in human vision: (1) the extent of any binocular advantage; (2) the possible site of this binocular summation; (3) whether or not purely monocular inputs exist for global motion perception; (4) the extent of any dichoptic interaction. Global motion coherence thresholds were measured using ran dom-dot-kinematograms as a function of the dot modulation depth (contrast) for translational, radial and circular flow fields. We found a marked binocular advantage of approximately 1.7, comparable for all three types of motion and the performance benefit was due to a contrast rather than a global motion enhancement. In addition, we found no evidence for any purely monocular influences on global motion detection. The results suggest that the site of binocular combination for global motion perception occurs prior to the extra-striate cortex where motion integration occurs. All cells involved are binocular and exhibit dichoptic interactions, suggesting the existence of a neural mechanism that involves more than just simple summation of the two monocular inputs.

Fronto-striatal connections in the human brain: A probabilistic diffusion tractography study	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						caudate; putamen; frontal connectivity; motor connectivity; diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography; humans	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; COMPARATIVE CYTOARCHITECTONIC ANALYSIS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; BASAL GANGLIA; CORTICOSTRIATAL PROJECTIONS; EYE-FIELD; COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DOPAMINE RELEASE	Anatomical studies in animals have described multiple striatal circuits and suggested that sub-components of the striatum, although functionally related, project to distinct cortical areas. To date, anatomical investigations in humans have been limited by methodological constraints such that most of our knowledge of fronto-striatal networks relies on nonhuman primate studies. To better identify the fronto-striatal pathways in the human brain, we used Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography to reconstruct neural connections between the frontal cortex and the caudate nucleus and putamen in vivo. We demonstrate that the human caudate nucleus is interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, frontal eye fields, cerebellum and thalamus; the putamen is interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, primary motor area, primary somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor area, cerebellum and thalamus. A connectivity-based seed classification analysis identified connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal areas (DLPFC) and the dorsal-posterior caudate nucleus and between the ventrolateral prefrontal areas (VLPFC) and the ventral-anterior caudate nucleus. For the putamen, connections exist between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal-posterior putamen while the premotor area projects to medial putamen, and the primary motor area to the lateral. putamen. Identifying the anatomical organization of the fronto-striatal network has important implications for understanding basal ganglia function and associated disease processes.

Factors that are upstream of IsI1 in cardiovascular progenitors have not yet been defined. Here we demonstrate that beta-catenin is required for IsI1 expression in cardiac progenitors, directly regulating the IsI1 promoter. Ablation of beta-catenin in IsI1-expressing progenitors disrupts multiple aspects of cardiogenesis, resulting in embryonic lethality at E13. beta-Catenin is also required upstream of a number of genes required for pharyngeal arch, outflow tract, and/or atrial septal morphogenesis, including Tbx2, Tbx3, Wnt11, Shh, and Pitx2. Our findings demonstrate that beta-catenin signaling regulates proliferation and survival of cardiac progenitors.

The cortical mapping of spatial frequencies (SF), which is the basic property that leads to perception of spatial details of visual objects, is still controversial. We recorded simultaneously extracellular action potentials from neighboring cells in superficial layers of the area 17-18 border region of anesthetized cats. Responses of nearby cells to sine-wave gratings of varying SF were analyzed. Spatial frequency tuning curves were cross-correlated to establish the degree of similarity between the curves and optimal SFs were compared for each pair of neurons. The investigation showed that only about a half of nearby neurons exhibited close optimal SFs and similar tuning curves. The results suggest that SF channels do not show a clear clustering within a small pool of neurons. Such organization may contribute to the perception of spatial details at all orientations and motion directions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Surgical removal and radiation therapy are associated with significant risk for morbidity in the pediatric population with craniopharyngioma. Intracystic therapies have been utilized in some centers to potentially decrease morbidity associated with cystic craniopharyngioma. The aim of the study was to review the Canadian experience with intracystic bleomycin therapy (ICB). METHODS. All centers in the Canadian Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (CPBTC) were invited to participate in a retrospective review of this treatment. A questionnaire was sent to each center. The data were analyzed at British Columbia's Children's Hospital. RESULTS. In all, 6 of 17 centers utilized ICB and submitted data. A total of 17 of 19 patients with the intention to treat received bleomycin. Twelve were treated at the time of diagnosis, and 5 at the time of recurrence. Five patients achieved a complete response, 6 achieved a partial response, and 5 achieved a minor response to bleomycin. One patient was stable for 2.8 years. At the time of last follow-up, 8 patients have not required further intervention. Complications included transient symptomatic peritumoral edema (2 patients), precocious puberty (I patient) and panhypopituitarism (2 patients). The median follow-up was 4 years (range, 0.5-10.2 years). The median progression-free survival was 1.8 years (range, 0.3-6.1 years). One patient died of a massive infarct secondary to radiation-induced moyamoya syndrome. CONCLUSIONS. ICB was found to be well tolerated in this group of children. ICB may be a feasible and effective therapy for certain children with craniopharyngioma. Bleomycin may delay the need for aggressive surgery or radiation therapy for several years. Prospective multiinstitutional clinical trials are required to further evaluate the feasibility effectiveness, and dose schedules of this treatment.

However, human IVIG trials have often been initiated on the basis of preclinical models that involve numerous discontinuities with the human disease. Below, we discuss various limitations of the mainstay model used in MG preclinical research, the murine orthotopic xenograft. After discussing alternative model systems like transgenic mouse models and canine xenografts, we argue that companion animals with spontaneous brain cancers offer a scientifically and ethically attractive system for preclinical testing of novel MG interventions. Ethical advantages and practical challenges of companion animal brain cancer trials are briefly discussed.

In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, chronic blockade of AMPA receptors for 14 days induces a substantial loss of dendritic spines on CAI pyramidal neurons. Here, using serial section electron microscopy, we show that loss of dendritic spines is paralleled by a significant reduction in synapse density. In contrast, we observed an increased number of asymmetric synapses onto the dendritic shaft, suggesting that spine retraction does not inevitably lead to synapse elimination. Functional analysis of the remaining synapses revealed that hippocampal circuitry compensates for the anatomical loss of synapses by increasing synaptic efficacy. Moreover, we found that the observed morphological and functional changes were associated with altered bidirectional synaptic plasticity. We conclude that continued activation of AMPA receptors is necessary for maintaining structure and function of central glutamatergic synapses.

In this study, single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to compare metabolite levels in the striatum for (1) 12 patients with drug-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD), (2) 12 patients with spontaneous oral dyskinesia (SOD), (3) 8 antidepressant-treated patients without TD, and (4) 8 control subjects. Statistically significant reductions in the choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) ratio were measured for the drug-treated patients with TD (-13%, P = 0.020) and SOD patients (-12%, P = 0.034) relative to control subjects. In comparison with antidepressant-treated patients without TD, drug-treated patients with TD showed a non statistically significant reduction in Cho/Cr (-11%, P = 0.079). All other metabolite ratios (N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/Cr, myo-inositol (ml)/Cr, glutamine + glutamate (Glx)/Cr, macromolecule + lipid (MM+Lip)/Cr, NAA/Cho) were unaffected by either type of dyskinesia. The observed Cho/Cr reduction in dyskinesia patients suggests decreased membrane phosphatidylcholine turnover, which provides free choline as precursor of molecules responsible for cellular signal transduction.

Unlike existing, asymmetrical EEG/fMRI data fusion algorithms, we build a joint EEG/fMRI generative model that explicitly accounts for local coupling/uncoupling of bioelectric and hemodynamic activities, which are supposed to share a common substrate. Under a dedicated assumption of spatio-temporal separability, the spatial profile of the common EEG/fMRI sources is introduced as an unknown hierarchical prior on both markers of cerebral activity. Thereby, a devoted Variational Bayesian (VB) learning scheme is derived to infer common EEG/fMRI sources from a joint EEG/fMRI dataset. This yields an estimate of the common spatial profile, which is built as a trade-off between information extracted from EEG and fMRI datasets. Furthermore, the spatial structure of the EEG/fMRI coupling/uncoupling is learned exclusively from the data. The proposed data generative model and devoted VBEM learning scheme thus provide an un-supervised well-balanced approach for the fusion of EEG/fMRI information. We first demonstrate our approach on synthetic data. Results show that, in contrast to classical EEG/fMRI fusion approach, the method proved efficient and robust regardless of the EEG/fMRI discordance level. We apply the method on EEG/fMRI recordings from a patient with epilepsy, in order to identify brain areas involved during the generation of epileptic spikes. The results are validated using intracranial EEG measurements. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recent studies in young healthy subjects show a negative association between hippocampal volume and memory. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations among hippocampal volume, cortisol levels and memory performance in a group of healthy young men. Hippocampal volume was determined by manual segmentation of high-resolution 3D Magnetic Resonance Images from 13 subjects. Stress-induced cortisol levels in response to the "Trier Social Stress Test" (TSST) as well as the cortisol response to awakening (CRA) over four weeks were assessed.. Declarative memory performance was tested before and after exposure to the TSST. The results show that larger hippocampal volume was associated with a significantly stronger cortisol increase in response to the TSST and a significantly greater CRA. Moreover, larger hippocampal volume was associated with significantly lower memory perfonnance before the TSST. Our results challenge the direction of the frequently observed relationships among hippocampal volume, cortisol reactivity and memory perfonnance and question the relevance of findings in clinical and aged subjects for young healthy populations.

Experimental animal study. Objective. To determine if viral vectors carrying the gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could be used to promote an axonal regenerative response in rubrospinal neurons after an acute cervical spinal cord injury. Summary of Background Data. Following axotomy in the cervical spinal cord, rubrospinal neurons undergo severe atrophy and fail to up-regulate important genes for regeneration. This can be attenuated or reversed with the infusion of BDNF to the injured cell bodies. This infusion technique, however, causes substantial parenchymal damage around the red nucleus and is limited by occlusion of the infusion pumps. This study examined whether viral vectors could be used to deliver the BDNF gene in a less damaging fashion and whether this could promote a regenerative response in injured rubrospinal neurons. Methods. Following a cervical spinal cord injury, the viral vectors were injected into the vicinity of the injured red nucleus. The extent of parenchymal damage around the red nucleus was assessed, as was the immunoreactivity to BDNF and cellular transfection patterns. Rubrospinal neuronal cross-ectional area was measured to determine if atrophy had been reversed, and in situ hybridization for GAP-43 and T alpha 1 tubulin was performed to determine if there genes, which are important for axonal regeneration, were up-regulated. Results. Parenchymal damage associated with viral injection was significantly less than with previous infusion techniques. BDNF immunoreactivity around the red nucleus indicated that the BDNF transgene was expressed. Both viral vectors reversed rubrospinal neuronal atrophy and promoted the expression of GAP-43 and T alpha 1 tubulin. Conclusions. Viral-ediated transfer of the BDNF gene was successful at promoting a regenerative response in rubrospinal neurons following acute cervical spinal cord injury, with significantly less parenchymal damage than previously observed when infusing the BDNF protein.

Defective retrotranslocation causes loss of anti-bax function in human familial prion protein mutants	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prion protein; apoptosis; Bax; familial prion protein mutations; cytosolic PrP; retrotranslocation	CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB-DISEASE; MEDIATED CELL-DEATH; WILD-TYPE; NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS; NEURONAL APOPTOSIS; JAPANESE PATIENTS; DNA POLYMORPHISM; EXPRESSION; PHENOTYPE; INSOMNIA	Prion protein (PrP) inhibits the activation of proapoptotic Bax in primary human neurons and MCF-7 cells. Because neuronal apoptosis occurs in human prion diseases, here we examine the anti-Bax function of familial PrP mutants. All Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and fatal familial insomnia-associated prion protein mutations partially or completely lose the anti-Bax function in human neurons and, except for A117V and V203I, in MCF-7 cells. The ability of the mutants to protect against Bax-mediated cell death is divided into three groups: (1) group I, retention of anti-Bax function in both the Val(129) and Met(129) mutants; (2) group II, retention of anti-Bax function only in Val(129) mutants; and (3) group III, reduction or no anti-Bax function in Val(129) and Met(129) mutants. The loss of anti-Bax function in these PrP mutants correlates completely with a significant decrease in the production of cytosolic PrP, a form of PrP shown previously to have anti-Bax function in human neurons. Cotransfection of the full-length PrP mutants with wild-type or mutant cytosolic PrP, but not with wild type full-length PrP, rescues the anti-Bax function of PrP. The results show that the failure of PrP mutants to produce cytosolic PrP is responsible for the loss of anti-Bax function and that the effect of the PrP mutants is dominant over wild-type PrP. Furthermore, these results imply that misfolded PrP that escapes retrotranslocation could accumulate at the cell surface and cause neuronal dysfunction.

EphA4 signaling regulates phospholipase C gamma 1 activation, cofilin membrane association, and dendritic spine morphology	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						synapse; plasticity; actin; hippocampus; neuron glia; phosphorylation	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 NEURONS; ACTIN-BASED PLASTICITY; SEMLIKI-FOREST-VIRUS; TYROSINE KINASE; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; C-GAMMA; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RAT-BRAIN	Specialized postsynaptic structures known as dendritic spines are the primary sites of glutamatergic innervation at synapses of the CNS. Previous studies have shown that spines rapidly remodel their actin cytoskeleton to modify their shape and this has been associated with changes in synaptic physiology. However, the receptors and signaling intermediates that restructure the actin network in spines are only beginning to be identified. We reported previously that the EphA4 receptor tyrosine kinase regulates spine morphology. However, the signaling pathways downstream of EphA4 that induce spine retraction on ephrin ligand binding remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ephrin stimulation of EphA4 leads to the recruitment and activation of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) in heterologous cells and in hippocampal slices. This interaction occurs through an Src homology 2 domain of PLC gamma 1 and requires the EphA4 juxtamembrane tyrosines. In the brain, PLC gamma 1 is found in multiple compartments of synaptosomes and is readily found in postsynaptic density fractions. Consistent with this, PLC activity is required for the maintenance of spine morphology and ephrin-induced spine retraction. Remarkably, EphA4 and PLC activity modulate the association of the actin depolymerizing/severing factor cofilin with the plasma membrane. Because cofilin has been implicated previously in the structural plasticity of spines, this signaling may enable cofilin to depolymerize actin filaments and restructure spines at sites of ephrin-EphA4 contact.

These membranes are unique in composition, the major lipids being ceramides (Cer), cholesterol, and free fatty acids (FFA) in approximately equimolar proportions. Notably, SC lipids include chains much longer than those of most biological membranes. Previously we showed that Cer's small hydrophilic headgroup enabled SC model membranes composed of bovine brain ceramide (BBCer), cholesterol, and palmitic acid in equimolar proportion to solidify at pH 5.2. In order to determine the influence of FFA chain length on the phase behavior of such membranes, we used H-2 NMR and FT-IR to study BBCer/cholesterol/FFA dispersions containing linear saturated FFA 14-22 carbons long. Independent of chain length, the solid phase dominated the FFA spectrum at physiological temperature. Upon heating, each dispersion underwent phase transitions to a liquid crystalline phase (only weakly evident for the membrane containing FFA-C22) and then to an isotropic phase. The phase behavior, the lipid mixing properties, and the transition temperatures are shown to depend strongly on FFA chain length. A distribution of FFA chain lengths is found in the SC and could be required for the coexistence of a proportion of solid lipids with some more fluid domains, which is known to be necessary for normal skin barrier function.

DO Collaboration	Evidence for production of single top quarks and first direct measurement of vertical bar V-tb vertical bar	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							BOOSTED DECISION TREES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FERMILAB-TEVATRON; PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION; SEARCH; COLLISIONS; COLLIDER; DETECTOR; EVENTS; BOSON	The D0 Collaboration presents first evidence for the production of single top quarks at the Fermilab Tevatron < p(p)over bar > collider. Using a 0.9 fb(-1) dataset, we apply a multivariate analysis to separate signal from background and measure sigma(< p(p)over bar >-> tb+X,tqb+X)=4.9 +/- 1.4 pb. The probability to measure a cross section at this value or higher in the absence of a signal is 0.035%, corresponding to a 3.4 standard deviation significance. We use the cross section measurement to directly determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element that describes the Wtb coupling and find 0.68 <vertical bar V-tb vertical bar <= 1 at 95% C.L. within the standard model.

Microglia were distinguished from macrophages by relative CD45 expression (CD45(dim)) using flow cytometry. Their expansion occurred rapidly and substantially outnumbered infiltrating macrophages; and T cells throughout the course of cuprizone treatment. We used bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and bone marrow chimeras to show that both proliferation and immigration from blood accounted for increased microglial numbers. Microglia adopted an activated phenotype during demyelination, up-regulating major histocompatibility class I and B7.2/CD86. A subpopulation of CD45(dim-high) microglia that expressed reduced levels of CD11b emerged during demyelination. These microglia expressed CD11c and were potent antigen-presenting cells in vitro. T cells were recruited to the demyelinated corpus callosum. but did not appear to be activated. Our study highlights the role of microglia as a heterogeneous population of cells in primary demyelination, with the capacity to present antigen, proliferate, and migrate into demyelinated areas.

Souza			Expression of an angiotensin-(1-7)-producing fusion protein in rats induced marked changes in regional vascular resistance	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						hemodynamic; blood flow; fluorescent microspheres; transgenic rats	SPONTANEOUSLY HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; ENZYME-RELATED CARBOXYPEPTIDASE; RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM; BIOLOGICAL PEPTIDE PUMP; IN-VIVO; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; RECEPTOR MAS; TRANSGENIC RATS; HEART FUNCTION; NITRIC-OXIDE	We have described a transgenic rat line that expresses an angiotensin-(1-7)-producing fusion protein, the TGR(A1-7)3292. In these rats, testis acts as an angiotensin-(1-7) biological pump, increasing its plasma concentration 2.5-fold. In this study, we performed hemodynamic measurements in TGR(A1-7)3292 and age-matched Hannover Sprague-Dawley (SD) control rats, using fluorescent microspheres. Urethane-anesthetized transgenic rats had similar levels of baseline blood pressure (99 +/- 3 mmHg) as did SD rats (101 +/- 3 mmHg). However, pronounced differences were observed in other hemodynamic measurements. TGR(A1-7)3292 rats presented a significant increase in stroke volume (0.29 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.01 ml in SD), increased cardiac index (24.6 +/- 0.91 vs. 21.9 +/- 0.65 ml center dot min(-1)center dot kg) and decreased total peripheral resistance (3.9 +/- 0.13 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.13 mmHg center dot ml(-1)center dot min center dot 100 g). The increase in stroke volume in transgenic rats may be partially explained by the small decrease in heart rate (326 +/- 7.0 vs. 359 +/- 6.0 beats/min in SD). Strikingly, TGR(A1-7)3292 rats presented a substantial decrease in the vascular resistance in lung, spleen, kidney, adrenals, brain, testis and brown fat tissue with no significant differences in the left ventricle, mesentery, skin, gastrocnemius muscle and white fat tissue. These results corroborate and extend previous results observed after acute angiotensin-(1-7) infusion, showing that chronic increase in circulating angiotensin(1-7) produces sustained and important changes in regional and systemic hemodynamics. Moreover, our data suggest a physiological role for angiotensin-(1-7) in the tonic control of regional blood flow.

Whether visualization of local anesthetic spread can supplant neurostimulation as the end point for local anesthetic injection during USG block has never been formally evaluated. Therefore, for this prospective randomized study, we recruited 72 patients scheduled for hand or forearm surgery and compared the speed of execution and quality USG infraclavicular block with either USG alone (Group U) or USG combined wit neurostimulation (Group S). In Group U, local anesthetic was deposited in a U-shaped distribution posterior and to each side of the axillary artery using as few injections as possible (1, 2, and 3 injections in 29, 6, and 3 patients, respectively). In Group S, a single injection was made after obtaining a distal motor response with a stimulating current between 0.3 and 0.6 mA. The anesthetic solution consisted of 0.5 mL/kg of lidocaine 1.5%, bupivacaine 0.125%, and epinephrine 1:200 000 (final concentrations). Procedure times were significantly shorter in Group U compared with Group S (3.1 +/- 1.6 min and 5.2 +/- 4.7 min, respectively; P = 0.006). In Group S, anesthetic spread was mainly anterior to the axillary artery in 37% of patients and mainly posterior in 63% of patients. Thirty minutes after the injection, 86% of patients in Group U had complete sensory block in the musculocutaneous, median, radial, and ulnar nerve territories compared with 57% in Group S (P = 0.007). Patients blocked in Group U with a single injection had the same rate of complete block (86%) as those blocked with more than one injection (86%). Block supplementation rates were 8% in Group U versus 26% in Group S (P = 0.049). Block failure occurred in one patient in Group S because of an inability to obtain a distal stimulation after 20 min. We conclude that USG infraclavicular block is more rapidly performed and yields a higher success rate when visualization of local anesthetic spread is used as the end point for injection. Posterolateral spread of local anesthetic around the axillary artery predicts successful block, circumventing the need for direct nerve visualization.

Developmental trajectories of male physical violence and theft - Relations to neurocognitive performance	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	57th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Criminology	NOV 16-19, 2005	Toronto, CANADA	Amer Soc Criminol			LIFE-COURSE PERSISTENT; OF-LIVING-SCALE; WAIS-R IQ; SHIPLEY-INSTITUTE; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; SHORT-TERM; AGGRESSION; ADOLESCENCE; DELINQUENCY; PREDICTORS	Context: Neurocognitive mechanisms have long been hypothesized to influence developmental trajectories of antisocial behavior. However, studies examining this association tend to aggregate a variety of problem behaviors that may be differently affected by neurocognitive deficits. Objective: To describe the developmental trajectories of physical violence and theft from adolescence to adulthood, their associations, and the neurocognitive characteristics of individuals following different patterns of trajectory association. Design: Accelerated cohort-sequential, longitudinal design. Setting: Rutgers Health and Human Development Project. Participants: Six hundred ninety-eight men. Main Outcome Measures: Self-reports of physical violence (ages 12-24 years) and theft (ages 12-31 years) were collected across 5 waves. Neurocognitive performance was assessed with executive function and verbal IQ tests between late adolescence and early adulthood. Results: The majority (55%) of subjects showed an increased frequency of theft during the study period, while only a minority (13%) evinced an increasing frequency of physical violence. Executive function and verbal IQ performance were negatively related to high frequency of physical violence but positively related to high frequency of theft. Conclusions: Developmental trajectories of physical violence and theft during adolescence and early adulthood are different and differently related to neurocognitive functioning. Global indexes of antisocial behavior mask the development of antisocial behavior subtypes and putative causal mechanisms.

Currently, three MI cotransporters have been identified: two are Na+-dependent (SMIT1 and SMIT2) and one is W-dependent (HMIT) and predominantly expressed in the brain. The goal of this study was to characterize the expression of SMIT2 in rabbit kidney and to compare it to SMIT1. First, we quantified mRNA levels for both transporters using quantitative real-time PCR and found that SMIT1 was predominantly expressed in the medulla while SMIT2 was mainly in the cortex. This distribution of SMIT2 was confirmed on Western blots where an antibody raised against a SMIT2 epitope specifically detected a 75 kDa protein in both tissues. Characterization of MI transport in brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV), in the presence Of D-chiro-inositol and L-fucose to separately identify SMIT1 and SMIT2 activities, showed that only SMIT2 is expressed at the luminal side of proximal convoluted tubules. We thus conclude that, in the rabbit kidney, SMIT2 is predominantly expressed in the cortex where it is probably responsible for the apical transport of MI into the proximal tubule.

Survivors of acute burns were evaluated during the hospitalization (N = 262) and at 1 week (N = 165) and 2 months (N = 100) after discharge. The prevalence of at least mild to moderate symptoms of depression (Beck Depression Inventory >= 10) ranged from 23% to 26%. In-hospital symptoms of depression predicted change in physical health from pre-burn to 2 months post-discharge (p =.02), controlling for patient demographics, burn severity, and symptoms of PTSD. These results suggest that patients should be screened for depression, both in-hospital and during rehabilitation after discharge. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

The disease later became known as "Scrapie" and was the first of a family of similar diseases affecting a number of species that are now known as the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs). The appearance of a new disease in humans linked to the consumption of meat products from infected cattle has stimulated widespread public concern and scientific interest in the prion protein and related diseases, Nearly 300 years after the first report, these diseases still merit the descriptor "strange". This family of diseases is characterized by a unique profile of histological changes, can be transmitted as inherited or acquired diseases, as well as apparent sporadic spontaneous generation of the disease. These diseases are believed by many, to be caused by a unique protein only infectious agent. The "prion protein" (PrPc), a term first coined by Stanley Prusiner in 1982 is crucial to the development of these diseases, apparently by acting as a substrate for an abnormal disease associated form. However, aside from being critical to the pathogenesis of the disease, the function of PrPc, which is expressed in all mammals, has defied definitive description. Several roles have been proposed on the basis of in vitro studies, however, thus far, in vivo confirmation has not been forthcoming. The biological features of PrPc also seem to be unusual. Numerous mouse models have been generated in an attempt to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases. This review summarizes the current state of histological features, the etiologic agent, the normal metabolism and the function of the prion protein, as well as the limitations of the mouse models.

SPG4 founder effect in French Canadians with hereditary spastic paraplegia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							GENE MUTATION; MAPS; POPULATION; SPECTRUM; FREQUENT; PROTEIN; ATAXIA; ONSET; FORM; PARAPARESIS	Background: The most common cause Of autosomal dominant Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is mutations in the SPG4 gene. We have previously identified novel SPG4 mutations in a collection of North American families including the c.G1801A mutation present in two families from Quebec. The aim of this Study is to estimate the frequency of the c.G1801A mutation in the French Canadian (FC) population and to determine whether this Mutation originates from a common ancestor. Methods: We collected and sequenced exon 15 in probands of 37 families. Genotypes of markers flanking the SPG4 gene were used to construct haplotypes in five families. Clinical information was reviewed by a neurologist with expertise in HSP. Results: We have identified three additional unrelated families with the c.G1801A mutation and haplotype analysis revealed that all five families share a common ancestor. The mutation is present in 7% of all Our FC families and explains half of our spastin linked FC families. The phenotype associated with the c.G1801A genotype is pure HSP with bladder involvement. Conclusion: In this study we have determined that the relative frequency of the c.G1801A mutation in our FC collection is 7%, and approximately 50% in the spastin positive FC group. This mutation is the most common HSP mutation identified in this population to date and is suggestive of a founder effect in Quebec.

In the present study, we sought to delineate the neural correlates of trigeminal stimulation using carbon dioxide (CO2) presented to the left or right nostril. Fifteen right-handed men underwent FMRI using single runs of 3 conditions (CO2 in the right and the left nostrils and an olfactory stimulant-phenyl ethyl alcohol-in the right nostril). As expected, olfactory activations were located in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, and rostral insula. For trigeminal stimulation, activations were found in "trigeminal" and "olfactory" regions including the pre- and postcentral gyrus, the cerebellum, the ventrolateral thalamus, the insula, the contralateral piriform cortex, and the OFC. Left compared with right side stimulations resulted in stronger cerebellar and brain stem activations; right versus left stimulation resulted in stronger activations of the superior temporal sulcus and OFC. These results suggest a trigeminal processing system that taps into similar cortical regions and yet is separate from that of the olfactory system. The overlapping pattern of cortical activation for trigeminal and olfactory stimuli is assumed to be due to the intimate connections in the processing of information from the 2 major intranasal chemosensory systems.

This study presents performance data on a spatial working memory task in 75 prenatally cocaine exposed (CE) and 55 nondrug-exposed (NDE) 8- to 10-year-old children. Methods: Children were administered a novel neuropsychological measure of immediate-and short-term memory for visuospatial information, the Groton Maze Learning Test (c) (GMLT), a computer-based hidden maze learning test that consists of a "timed chase test" (a simple measure of visuomotor speed), eight learning trials followed by a delayed recall trial after an 8-minute delay and a reverse learning trial. Performance is expressed as correct moves per second and number of errors per trial. Results: Across all trials, the cocaine-exposed group showed significantly slower correct moves per second and made significantly more errors. There were no significant main effects for amounts of alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana exposure. After an 8-minute delay and compared to the eighth trial, cocaine-exposed children showed less consolidation in learning compared to nonexposed children. When asked to complete the maze in reverse, cocaine-exposed children showed a greater decrement in performance (decreased correct moves per second and increased errors) compared to the eighth learning trial. Conclusions: Children exposed in utero to cocaine exhibit a possible impairment in procedural learning and diminished efficiency in creating and accessing an internal spatial map to master the hidden maze.

Simulation of progressive spinal deformities in Duchenne muscular dystrophy using a biomechanical model integrating muscles and vertebral growth modulation	CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Duchenne muscular dystrophy; scoliosis; growth modulation; motor control; muscles; biomechanical model	ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS; LUMBAR ERECTOR SPINAE; BONE-MINERAL DENSITY; MOTOR CONTROL; DEFLAZACORT; MANAGEMENT; TRUNK	Background. Ninety percent of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients develop scoliosis in parallel with evident muscular and structural impairment. Altered muscular spinal loads acting on growing vertebrae are likely to promote a self-sustaining spinal deformation process. The purpose of this study was to simulate the effect of asymmetrical fat infiltration of the erector spinae muscles combined with vertebral growth modulation over a period of growth spurt. Methods. A finite element model of the trunk was built. It integrates (1) longitudinal growth of vertebral bodies and its modulation due to mechanical stresses, (2) muscles and control processes generating muscle recruitment and forces. Three different impairments of the erector spinae muscles were considered and their actions over 12 consecutive cycles representing a span of 12 months were analyzed. Findings. When asymmetrical muscle degeneration was simulated and weaker erector spinae muscles were located on the convex side of the curve, mild scoliosis (Cobb angle of 8-19 degrees) was induced in the frontal plane and the kyphosis increased from 72 degrees to 110 degrees in all simulations. Those changes were accompanied by a substantial increase of muscle activity in the Rectus Abdominus and Obliquus Internus. Interpretation. Scoliosis as documented in the literature were induced through an asymmetrical activity in the erector spinae muscles and it can be hypothesized that the Rectus Abdominus and Obliquus Internus have a role in maintaining balance and counteracting against spine torsion. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the modeling approach to investigate a musculo-skeletal deformation process based on a neuromuscular deficit. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chouinard, S; Sepehry, AA; Stip, E				Chouinard, Sylvie; Sepehry, Amir Ali; Stip, Emmanuel			Oral cholinesterase inhibitor add-on therapy for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia: A quantitative systematic review, part I	CLINICAL NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Review						cognition; schizophrenia; acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; rivastigmine; galantamine; donepezil; meta-analysis	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIALS; DOUBLE-BLIND; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RIVASTIGMINE TREATMENT; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGE; ADJUNCTIVE DONEPEZIL; OPEN-LABEL; GALANTAMINE; RISPERIDONE	Rationale: Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is associated with outcomes affecting social function and vocational performance. Cognitive enhancement is thus recognized as fundamental in the treatment of schizophrenia. Some clinical trials have used acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) add-on therapy to test the cognitive-enhancing effects of these kinds of medication, which is usually prescribed for indications other than schizophrenia. Objective: To perform a quantitative systematic review of the effects of AChEI on various cognitive domains (attention, language, and motor and executive functions) in schizophrenia. Data Source: Exhaustive electronic search engines, hand searches, cross-referencing of studies, and contacts with investigators were carried out. Data Selection: The studies included compared neurocognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia before and after AChEI treatment in randomized controlled trials and crossover and open trials of AChEI in people with schizophrenia. Results: Our findings reveal a small, but significant, homogeneous effect estimate of AChEI on attention before and after treatment. A small nonsignificant heterogeneous effect estimate was yielded for motor performance after AChEI treatment. However, no significant change appears in language performance or executive functions after AChEI treatment, independently of the type of AChEI. After AChEI treatment, when patients were compared with control groups, no difference appears in attention and executive functions. Nevertheless, the analysis reveals that the control groups performed better on language tasks than patients after AChEI treatment but worse on motor tasks. Conclusions: Despite an extensive investigation of the electronic and gray literature, few data appropriate for the meta-analysis were found. The results reveal a small improvement in attention and a trend on motor tasks after AChEI medication in schizophrenia. No clear conclusion can yet be reached concerning the cognitive-enhancing effects of AChEI considering the small number of studies available. This finding needs to be substantiated by larger trials. This systematic review complements a meta-analysis focusing on memory, which showed a small improvement with a cocktail of antipsychotics and AChEIs.

To evaluate potential effects on the early life stages of Japanese medaka, larvae and fertilized eggs were exposed to letrozole for 96 h and 14 days, respectively. No larvae died and no adverse effects were found on embryonic development at concentrations up to 3125 mu g/L. Reproductive effects were assessed by exposing adults to 1, 5, 25, 125 and. 625 mu g/L letrozole for 21 days. A dose-dependent decrease in fecundity (> 25 mu g/L) and fertility (> 5 mu g/ L) accompanied by histological changes suggested the inhibition of oocyte growth and possibly maturation. At 625 mu g/L, the fish ceased spawning during the last week of exposure. Letrozole (> 5 mu g/L) reduced plasma vitellogenin levels in females in a dose-dependent manner. Transgenerational effects were evaluated by removing freshly-laid F I eggs from letrozole-contaminated water and raising them to 15 days post-hatching in control water. Hatchability and time to hatching were detrimentally affected (> 5 mu g/L), but no morphological deformities were observed. Furthermore, a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of genotypic F1 males was found (> 5 mu g/L). (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The schizophrenic patients were cognitively impaired and were deficient in the ADL. However, the impairment of ADL could not be explained specifically by impairment of higher-order executive function or by negative symptoms: memory functions were more related to impairment of ADL and positive symptoms as much as the negative ones. Positive symptoms were significantly related to commissive errors in the ADL, whereas negative symptoms were non significantly related to omissive errors. Negative symptoms were significantly more related to memory impairment than to impairment on measures of higher-order executive function (working memory). This investigation demonstrates that an ecologically oriented approach to test development and measurement of ADL is fruitful in understanding schizophrenia-especially if it is constrained by cognitive constructs compatible with the phenomenology of the disease.

The Bayesian revolution approaches psychological development	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							PROBABILISTIC MODELS; REASONING ABILITIES; LEARNING ALGORITHM; BASE RATES; SENSITIVITY; COGNITION; NETWORKS; CHILDREN; NETS	This commentary reviews five articles that apply Bayesian ideas to psychological development, some with psychology experiments, some with computational modeling, and some with both experiments and modeling. The reviewed work extends the current Bayesian revolution into tasks often studied in children, such as causal learning and word learning, and provides evidence that children's performance can be optimal in a Bayesian sense. There remains much to be done in terms of understanding how representations are created, how development occurs, how Bayesian computation might be neurally implemented, and in reconciling the new work with older evidence that even skilled adults are incompetent Bayesians.

Association studies of BMI and type 2 diabetes in the neuropeptide y pathway - A possible role for NPY2R as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes in men	DIABETES			English	Article							BODY-MASS INDEX; HUMAN OBESITY; HUMAN GENOME; PEPTIDE YY; HAPLOTYPE RECONSTRUCTION; FRAMESHIFT MUTATION; QUANTITATIVE TRAITS; LINKAGE ANALYSIS; COMMON DISEASE; RECEPTOR GENES	The neuropeptide Y (NPY) family of peptides and receptors regulate food intake. Inherited variation in this pathway could influence susceptibility to obesity and its complications, including type 2 diabetes. We genotyped a set of 71 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that capture the most common variation in NPY, PPY, PYY, NPY1R, NPY2R, and NPY5R in 2,800 individuals of recent European ancestry drawn from the near extremes of BMI distribution. Five SNPs located upstream of NPY2R were nominally associated with BMI in men (P values = 0.001-0.009, odds ratios [ORs] 1.27-1.34). No association with BMI was observed in women, and no consistent associations were observed for other genes in this pathway. We attempted to replicate the association with BMI in 2,500 men and tested these SNPs for association with type 2 diabetes in 8,000 samples. We observed association with BMI in men in only one replica- tion sample and saw no association in the combined replication samples (P = 0.154, OR = 1.09). Finally, a 9% haplotype was associated with type 2 diabetes in men (P = 1.73 x 10(-4), OR = 1.36) and not in women. Variation in this pathway likely does not have a major influence on BMI, although small effects cannot be ruled out; NPY2R should be considered a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes in men.

We hypothesized that, in a head-to-head comparison, one of the approaches might demonstrate better accuracy and performance characteristics than the other. Methods: A previously published nomogram, which relies on age, digital rectal examination, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and percent-free PSA, and an ANN, which relies on the same predictors plus prostate volume, were applied to a cohort of 3980 men, who were subjected to multicore systematic prostate biopsy. The accuracy and the performance characteristics were compared between these two approaches. Results: The accuracy of the nomogram was 71% versus 67% for the ANN (p = 0.0001). Graphical exploration of the performance characteristics demonstrated virtually perfect predictions for the nomogram. Conversely, the ANN underestimated the observed rate of prostate cancer. Conclusions: A 4% increase in predictive accuracy implies that the use of the nomogram instead of the ANN will result in 40 additional patients who will be correctly classified between benign and cancer.

Center of pressure (COP) displacements were recorded in children with TS and unaffected siblings in three conditions using a force platform: (1) Eyes-Open, (2) Eyes-Closed, (3) One-Leg standing with eyes open. The COP range and velocity were higher in children with TS than in unaffected siblings in all conditions. These differences could not be attributed to age, present tic severity, comorbidities (hyperactivity and compulsions) or medication. The data suggest that sub-clinical postural control anomalies are present in TS.

This homeostatic control is believed to be mediated by osmosensory neurones which synaptically regulate the electrical activity of command neurones that mediate each of these osmoregulatory effector responses. Our present understanding of the molecular, cellular and network basis that underlies the central control of osmoregulation is largely derived from studies on primary osmosensory neurones in the organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) and effector neurones in the supraoptic nucleus (SON), which release hormones that regulate diuresis and natriuresis. Primary osmosensory neurones in the OVLT exhibit changes in action potential firing rate that vary in proportion with ECF osmolality. This effect results from the intrinsic depolarizing receptor potential which these cells generate via a molecular transduction complex that may comprise various members of the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) family of cation channel proteins, notably TRPV1 and TRPV4. Osmotically evoked changes in the firing rate of OVLT neurones then regulate the electrical activity of downstream neurones in the SON through graded changes in glutamate release.

Neuroscientists are trying to understand how the remodeling of synapses at the molecular level leads to changes in learning and memory. The lateral movement of neurotransmitter receptors is emerging as an important mechanism in the control of synaptic transmission. However, our understanding of the spatial dynamics of membrane receptors at synapses has been limited largely because of a lack of appropriate tools to resolve single receptors in living cells. Fluorescent quantum dots represent promising probes to monitor individual synaptic receptors in living neural circuits. Bats and colleagues, Bats, Groc, and Choquet, Neuron 53, 719, 2007). used quantum dots to track the ins and outs of glutamate receptors at synapses, showing that the receptors bring company as they diffuse in the synapse to become trapped via their partner's local connections. Their study sheds new light on the mechanisms used by synapses to change their efficacy, which may impact on our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of learning and memory.

Effects of the pharmacologic manipulation of testosterone on cognitive functioning in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized, placebo-controlled treatment study	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						testosterone; sex hormones; cognition; verbal fluency; visuospatial abilities; polycystic ovary syndrome	CROSS-SEX HORMONES; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; SPATIAL ABILITIES; VERBAL MEMORY; YOUNG-WOMEN; ELDERLY-MEN; PERFORMANCE; ESTROGEN; HYPERANDROGENISM; SUPPLEMENTATION	In a previous study, we found that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an endocrine disorder characterized by chronic hyperandrogenism, performed more poorly than healthy, matched controls on a number of neuropsychological tests, in particular tests of verbal fluency, verbal memory, manual dexterity, and vistrospatial working memory. This randomized, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to investigate whether pharmacologic manipulation of free testosterone (free T) levels in women with PCOS might affect their performance on cognitive tests. Nineteen women with PCOS completed a battery of neuropsychological tests before and after 3 months of treatment with either an anti-androgen (cyproterone acetate) plus estrogen or with a placebo. Hormone treatment of women with PCOS caused a significant reduction in their free T levels but did not affect performance on tests vistrospatial ability, verbal memory, manual dexterity, or perceptual speed. Women treated with hormone therapy did, however, demonstrate an improvement in their performance on a test of verbal fluency compared to their pretreatment scores. These findings suggest that changes in free T levels do not have a significant impact on cognitive performance in women with PCOS, although reductions in free T may be beneficial for verbal fluency.

Testosterone levels and cognitive functioning in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and in healthy young women	HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						testosterone; sex hormones; cognition; verbal fluency; visuospatial abilities; polycystic ovary syndrome	HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY; TEMPORAL-LOBE SURGERY; CROSS-SEX HORMONES; WORKING-MEMORY; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; SPATIAL ABILITIES; IMMEDIATE MEMORY; PLASMA ANDROGENS; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE	We investigated the possible influence of testosterone (T) on cognitive functioning in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an endocrine disorder associated with elevated levels of free testosterone (free T). Performance on a battery of neuropsychological tests in 29 women with elevated free T levels due to PCOS was compared to the performance of 22 age- and education-matched, healthy control women with free T levels in the normal female range. Women with PCOS had significantly higher levels of free T (estimated by the free androgen index) and demonstrated significantly worse performance on tests of verbal fluency, verbal memory, manual dexterity, and visuospatial working memory than the healthy control women. No differences between the groups were found on tests of mental rotation, spatial visualization, spatial perception, or perceptual speed. These results suggest that, in women, elevations in free T may be associated with poorer performance on cognitive tasks that tend to show a female advantage. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The parents of 88 VLBW infants were recruited through the NICU of a tertiary-care hospital, approximately 2 weeks following delivery. Parents completed self-report questionnaires measuring anxiety, marital quality, and social support. Prior to discharge, each parent was observed twice during a feeding interaction with the infant. Maternal anxiety was greater when their infants were smaller in terms of birth weight and younger in gestational age. Maternal education, marital status, and country of origin, as well as social support and marital quality, were also associated with anxiety. Paternal anxiety was not related to socioeconomic status or infant medical risk, but was associated with country of origin, social support, and marital quality. For both mothers and fathers, anxiety was a better predictor of parental behavior than was infant medical risk. These findings suggest the need to intervene with anxious parents in order to promote satisfactory parent-infant relationships.

In a former study, it was demonstrated that the retina of juvenile Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat has a remarkable intrinsic resistance to light-induced retinopathy compared with the adult retina. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this endogenous resistance to light-induced damage. METHODS. juvenile SD rats were exposed for 6 (from P14 to P20) or 14 (from P14 to P28) days to a bright, cyclic, luminous environment of 10,000 lux. Retinal histology was examined immediately after exposure to light or at 2 months of age, and photoreceptor cell death was quantified by measuring the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and by TUNEL assays. Changes in protein levels and cellular localization of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined by Western blot analysis and retinal immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS. The data demonstrate that although the rate of photoreceptor loss was different after 6 and 14 days of exposure to light, similar ONL thickness was reached at 2 months of age-that is, 4 to 5 weeks after exposure to light. A large number of TUNEL-positive photoreceptors was visualized immediately after 6 and 14 days of exposure to light, reflecting the intense cell death that was occurring in the ONL. Western blot analysis showed that exposure to light induced a strong upregulation of the neurotrophic factors FGF-2 and CNTF in juvenile retinas, whereas no change in BDNF protein expression was noted. Of interest, after exposure to light, endogenous FGF-2 and CNTF were selectively upregulated in Muller cells. CONCLUSIONS. The results show that endogenous expression of FGF-2 and CNTF by Muller glia may play a role in protecting the juvenile retina from light-induced damage.

Snake venoms naturally contain a variety of proteins that can affect integrin-ligand interactions. Recently, the C-type lectin proteins (CLPs) have been characterized as efficient modulators of integrin functions. In this study, we investigated the anti-angiogenic activity of lebectin, a newly discovered CLP from Macrovipera lebetina venom. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), used as an in vitro model, express alpha vP3, alpha v beta 5, and alpha 5 beta 1 integrins, as well as the alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 6, and beta 4 subunits. Our data show that lebectin acts as a very potent inhibitor (IC50, approximate to 0.5 nM) of HBMEC adhesion and migration on fibronectin by blocking the adhesive functions of both the alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha V integrins. In addition, lebectin strongly inhibits both HBMEC in vitro tubulogenesis on Matrigel (TM) (IC50 = 0.4 nM) and proliferation. Finally, using both a chicken CAM assay and a Matrigel (TM) Plug assay in nude mice, our results show that lebectin displays potent anti-angiogenic activity in vivo. Lebectin thus represents a new C-type lectin with anti-angiogenic properties with great potential for the treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases.

Epidemiological survey of central nervous system germ cell tumors in Canadian children	JOURNAL OF NEURO-ONCOLOGY			English	Article						incidence; germ cell tumors; childhood	PRIMARY INTRACRANIAL TUMORS; PINEAL REGION TUMORS; THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES; PATIENT POPULATIONS; KUMAMOTO PREFECTURE; BRAIN-TUMORS; JAPAN; EXPERIENCE; CHILDHOOD; KOREA	Objectives To determine the incidence and characteristics of pediatric patients with central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors (GCT) in Canada. Method A national retrospective review of hospital charts was done on all patients with CNS GCT diagnosed between 1990 and 2004. Patients had to be under age 18 years at the time of diagnosis of a CNS germ cell tumor and be a resident of Canada. Information extracted included age and year of diagnosis, pathological diagnosis, location of tumor, evidence of disseminated disease at time of diagnosis and biological markers. Results One hundred and twenty-one cases were identified (83 germinoma; 38 non-germinoma germ cell tumor). The mean annual incidence of CNS GCT was 1.06 per million children (0.7 per million for germinoma; 0.3 per million for NGGCT). Though yearly incidences varied, there was no clear trend to increased incidence. Male predominance was noted (2.4:1 for germinoma; 11:1 for NGGCT). The primary locations were the pineal and suprasellar regions. At the time of diagnosis, disseminated disease was not uncommon (22% germinoma; 32% NGGCT). beta human gonadotrophin was elevated in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or both in 7% of patients with germinoma and 36% of patients with NGGCT. Elevation of alpha-fetoprotein in serum, CSF or both was seen in 34% of patients with NGGCT. Conclusion The incidence of CNS germ cell tumors in Canadian children is similar to that observed in other Western countries.

We have recently shown selective sparing of somatostatin (SST)-positive neurons and increased SST expression in NMDA agonist-induced neurotoxicity. Accordingly, the present study was undertaken to determine the effect of A beta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity on the expression of SST in cultured cortical neurons. Cultured cortical cells were exposed to A beta(25-35) and processed to determine the cellular content and release of SST into medium by radioimmunoassay and SST mRNA by RT-PCR. A beta(25-35) induces neuronal cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion, increases SST mRNA synthesis and induces an augmentation in the cellular content of SST. No significant changes were seen on SST release at any concentration of A beta(25-35) after 24 h of treatment. However, A beta(25-35) induces a significant increase of SST release into medium only after 12 h in comparison with other time points. Most significantly, SST-positive neurons are selectively spared in the presence of a lower concentration of A beta(25-35), whereas, in the presence of higher concentrations of A beta(25-35) for extended time periods, SST-positive neurons decrease gradually. Furthermore, A beta(25-35) induces apoptosis at lower concentrations (5 and 10 mu mol/L) and necrosis at higher concentrations (20 and 40 mu mol/L). Consistent with the increased accumulation of SST, these data suggest that A beta(25-35) impairs cell membrane permeability. Selective sparing of SST-positive neurons at lower concentrations of A beta(25-35) at early time points directly correlates with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.

Erythropoietin (Epo) and the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) are expressed in neural tissues and protect against oxidative and other stressors in various models of brain injury and disease. Our objective in this study was to determine whether EpoR is upregulated in the brains of persons with sporadic AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Postmortem hippocampus and temporal cortex from subjects with AD, MCI, and no cognitive impairment (NCI) were procured from the Religious Orders Study. Total immunoreactive EpoR protein was determined by Western blotting. Astrocytes expressing immunoreactive EpoR were quantified in 4 temporal and 6 hippocampal regions, and correlated with clinical, neuropsychologic, and neuropathologic indices. Total immunoreactive EpoR protein was markedly increased in AD and MCI temporal cortex versus NCI tissues. Composite measures of glial EpoR expression in temporal cortex layers I to IV were significantly greater in the MCI group compared with the NCI and AD groups. Hippocampal EpoR scores were increased in persons with MCI and AD relative to those with NCI. There was substantial subregional heterogeneity in disease-related EpoR expression patterns in AD and MCI temporal cortex and hippocampus. There was no association of EpoR-positive astrocytes with summary measures of global cognition or AD pathology. We conclude that upregulation of EpoR in temporal cortical and hippocampal astrocytes is an early, potentially neuroprotective, event in the pathogenesis of sporadic AD.

Muscarinic receptor activation elicits sustained, recurring depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							MESENCEPHALIC LOCOMOTOR REGION; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; SPINAL-CORD; BRAIN-STEM; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; SYNAPTIC-INTERACTIONS; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; VISUAL INPUTS; AMINO-ACIDS	In lampreys, brain stem reticulospinal (RS) neurons constitute the main descending input to the spinal cord and activate the spinal locomotor central pattern generators. Cholinergic nicotinic inputs activate RS neurons, and consequently, induce locomotion. Cholinergic muscarinic agonists also induce locomotion when applied to the brain stem of birds. This study examined whether bath applications of muscarinic agonists could activate RS neurons and initiate motor output in lampreys. Bath applications of 25 mu M muscarine elicited sustained, recurring depolarizations (mean duration of 5.0 +/- 0.5 s recurring with a mean period of 55.5 +/- 10.3 s) in intracellularly recorded rhombencephalic RS neurons. Calcium imaging experiments revealed that muscarine induced oscillations in calcium levels that occurred synchronously within the RS neuron population. Bath application of TTX abolished the muscarine effect, suggesting the sustained depolarizations in RS neurons are driven by other neurons. A series of lesion experiments suggested the caudal half of the rhombencephalon was necessary. Microinjections of muscarine (75 mu M) or the muscarinic receptor (mAchR) antagonist atropine (1 mM) lateral to the rostral pole of the posterior rhombencephalic reticular nucleus induced or prevented, respectively, the muscarinic RS neuron response. Cells immunoreactive for muscarinic receptors were found in this region and could mediate this response. Bath application of glutamatergic antagonists (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione/D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) abolished the muscarine effect, suggesting that glutamatergic transmission is needed for the effect. Ventral root recordings showed spinal motor output coincides with RS neuron sustained depolarizations. We propose that unilateral mAchR activation on specific cells in the caudal rhombencephalon activates a circuit that generates synchronous sustained, recurring depolarizations in bilateral populations of RS neurons.

We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and spike activity in the striatum, a basal ganglia structure implicated in behavioral action-sequence learning and performance, as rats engaged in spontaneous and instructed behaviors in a T-maze task. We found that during voluntary behaviors, striatal LFPs exhibit prominent theta-band oscillations together with rhythms at higher and lower frequencies. Analysis of the theta-band activity demonstrated that these oscillations are strongly modulated during task performance and increase as the animals choose and execute their turning responses in the cue-instructed T-maze task. These theta rhythms are locally generated and are coherent across large parts of the striatum. We suggest that modulation of oscillatory activity in the striatum may be a key feature of neural processing related to the control of voluntary behavior.

The patient presented with headache. Head computed tomography scanning revealed no abnormal findings. The cerebrospinal fluid was sampled and analyzed and a diagnosis of SAH was established. Investigation, including magnetic resonance imaging of the cord as well as cerebral and spinal angiography, revealed a conus medullaris AVM and a saccular aneurysm located on the ASA at the T-11 level. The aneurysm was thought to be responsible for the bleeding. Superselective ASA angiography showed that the aneurysm was at the bifurcation between a large coronal artery supplying the AVM and the ASA. The relation of the aneurysm's neck to the main spinal axis and the aneurysm's morphological features indicated that the lesion was suited for endosaccular coil therapy. The aneurysm was selectively occluded, using electrodetachable bare platinum coils. Follow-up angiography immediately after surgery and at 6 months thereafter demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysm and a perfectly patent anterior spinal axis. On clinical follow-up examination, the patient remained neurologically intact. When the morphological features of a spinal aneurysm and its relation with the anterior spinal axis are favorable, selective endosaccular coil placement can successfully be achieved.

This is reflected in clinical practice by a wide variability in imaging study use and by the fact that some patients are discharged home from the emergency room (ER), whereas others are admitted to the hospital with or without a period of observation before admission. To address this issue, we proposed and applied a new protocol for minor head injury at our institution. Methods: Between January 2004 and December 2005, 417 patients presented to the emergency department at our institution with minor head injury. All of them had fallen from less than I in. Every chart was retrospectively evaluated, and pertinent data were extracted. Results: The mean age of the patients was 9.8 months (2 weeks to 32 months). One hundred fifty-three had a skull x-ray, and 13 had a CT scan of the head. Of the 153 patients who had a skull x-ray, only 15 had a skull fracture. Of these 15 patients, 3 also had a CT scan of the head that confirmed the diagnosis of skull fracture. Of the 13 CT scans that were done, only these 3 were positive. Eleven patients were kept in the ER for 6 hours for close observation, and 5 of these were eventually admitted. Overall, 8 patients were admitted to the hospital for observation. Of these 8 patients, 7 had a skull x-ray, from which 5 were positive. Only 2 of the admitted patients had a CT scan, and they Were both positive for a skull fracture. One of the CT also demonstrated a subdural hematoma along with subarachnoid hemorrhage. These 2 patients also had a positive skull x-ray. None of the patients that were admitted had headaches or neurologic impairments. The mean age of the patients admitted was 3.8 months (2 weeks to 12 months). The mean hospital stay was 1.2 days (1-3 days). Conclusion: Only 10% of the skull x-rays and CT scans were positive for a skull fracture, which led to an admission in half of these patients. The other half was mainly discharged from ER after being observed. Several patients underwent a skull x-ray that we feel was not necessary in the management of their minor head injury. For those who had a head CT scan, only one revealed additional information and none of them had an impact on the final management. Observation in the ER could have been reasonable for most cases.

Adenotonsillectomy improves sleep, breathing, and quality of life but not behavior	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS			English	Article							APNEA SYNDROME; CHILD-BEHAVIOR; HYPERACTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; DISORDERS; SYMPTOMS; ADENOIDECTOMY; TONSILLECTOMY; ADOLESCENTS; INATTENTION	Objective To obtain parental perspectives on changes in sleep, breathing, quality. of life (QOL), and neurobehavioral measures after adenotonsillectomy. Study design This retrospective cohort study comprised otherwise healthy children evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) from 1993 to 2001. We compared those children who underwent adenotonsillectomy with those children who did not. The parents of 473 children (292 boys) 2 years of age and older were sent questionnaires to evaluate QOL and clinical and behavioral changes. For 94 children 3 years of age and older, behavioral changes were evaluated using the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised (CPRS-R) for three different periods: pre-operatively/pre-polysomnography, postoperatively/ postpolysomnography, and recently. Results One hundred and sixty-six questionnaires were returned (35%), 138 of which were complete with written consent provided. Compared with parents of unoperated children, parents of children who had adenotonsillectomy were more likely to report improvements in sleep, breathing, and QOL but not improvements in concentration, school performance, and intellectual or developmental progress. Both short and long term, there were no significant effects of adenotonsillectomy on any of the CPRS-R behavior subscales. Conclusion From a parental perspective, adenotonsillectomy frequently improves sleep, breathing, and QOL but does not often improve neurobehavioral outcomes.

It remains unclear, however, how they handle the extensive variability inherent to speech, and how they process multiple linguistic functions that share the same acoustic parameters. Across four neural network simulations of lexical tone acquisition, self-organizing maps were trained with continuous speech input of increasing variability. Robust tonal categorization was achieved by tracking the velocity profiles of fundamental frequency contours. This result suggests that continuous speech signal carries sufficient categorical information that can be directly processed, and that dynamic acoustic information can be used for resolving the variability problem.

Here, we characterized P-CREB expression in area V1 of monkeys at multiple time-points after monocular enucleation (ME) to assess the possible contribution of CREB in visually deprived neocortex. Immunoblot assays and immunostainings showed that P-CREB is dynamically regulated in adult area VI, reaching a peak level between 5 and 30 days after ME, and becoming reduced at the 90-day post-ME time-point. This striking temporal increase in P-CREB level was paralleled by a concomitant increase of two CREB-regulated prosurvival effectors, namely Bcl-2 and Bcl-w. We present our results in the context of recent advances about adult visual neocortex and propose that ME induces a multifaceted CREB-mediated response that favors intrinsic stability of neurons and facilitates mature cortical networks to reorganize over a prolonged period.

Metabolic derangement of methionine and folate metabolism in mice deficient in methionine synthase reductase	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND METABOLISM			English	Article						homocysteine; hyperhomocyst(e)inemia; folate metabolism; gene trap; methionine synthase reductase; methionine metabolism; hypomethioninemia; methyl trap; S-adenosylmethionine; S-adenosylhomocysteine	NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; CYSTATHIONINE BETA-SYNTHASE; GLYCINE N-METHYLTRANSFERASE; TOTAL HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS; MEGALOBLASTIC-ANEMIA; METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE; INTERALLELIC COMPLEMENTATION; S-ADENOSYLHOMOCYSTEINE; PLASMA HOMOCYSTEINE; FLAVOPROTEIN SYSTEM	Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is a metabolic derangement that is linked to the distribution of folate pools, which provide one-carbon units for biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate and for remethylation of homocysteine to form methionine. In humans, methionine synthase deficiency results in the accumulation of methyltetrahydrofolate at the expense of folate derivatives required for purine and thymidylate biosynthesis. Complete ablation of methionine synthase activity in mice results in embryonic lethality. Other mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia have normal or reduced levels of methyltetrahydrofolate and are not embryonic lethal, although they have decreased ratios of AdoMet/AdoHcy and impaired methylation. We have constructed a mouse model with a gene trap insertion in the Mtrr gene specifying methionine synthase reductase, an enzyme essential for the activity of methionine synthase. This model is a hypomorph, with reduced methionine synthase reductase activity, thus avoiding the lethality associated with the absence of methionine synthase activity. Mtrr(g1/g1) mice have increased plasma homocyst(e)ine, decreased plasma methionine, and increased tissue methyltetrahydrofolate. Unexpectedly, Mtrr(gt/gt) mice do not show decreases in the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio in most tissues. The different metabolite profiles in the various genetic mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia may be useful in understanding biological effects of elevated homocyst(e)ine. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

From a database of 143 EEG-fMRI studies, we selected the 16 data sets that showed both strong fMRI activation in the original analysis and only a single spike type in the EEG. Scans were then analyzed using seven model HRFs, peaking 3 or 1 s before the event, or 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 s after it. An HRF was calculated using a deconvolution method for all activations seen in each analysis. The results showed that seven data sets had HRFs that peaked 1 s after the event or earlier, indicating a BOLD change starting prior to the spike seen on the scalp EEG. This is surprising since the BOLD change is expected to result from the spike. For most of the data sets with early peaking HRFs, the maximum activation in all of the statistical maps was when the model HRF peaked 1 s after the event, suggesting that the early activation was at least as important as any later activation. We suggest that this early activity is the result of neuronal changes occurring several seconds prior to a surface EEG event, but that these changes are not visible on the scalp. This is the first report of a BOLD response occurring several seconds prior to an interictal event seen on the scalp and could have important implications for our understanding of the generation of epileptic discharges.

Conventional MRI techniques sensitively detect inflammation, demyelination, and tissue injury. Less conventional imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetization transfer imaging, and advanced image processing to quantify structural changes can provide more specific and inherently quantitative markers of the pathologic processes underlying the accumulation of disease burden and the progression of clinical disability. Together, these techniques can assess both the anti-inflammatory and the neuroprotective effects of immunomodulatory therapies.

Strategies for preventing such damage may include deviation of activated T cells into the Th2 subset (e.g., via use of glatiramer acetate), alteration of functional properties of Th1 cells ( e. g., through use of interferon [INF]-ss or IV immunoglobulin), and inhibition of activated cell migration into the CNS (e.g., by employing INF-ss or natalizumab). Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) also causes neuron death in neurotoxicity models, and examination of medications with MMP inhibitory activity indicates that minocycline is capable of preventing such damage. Minocycline also has other properties relevant to conferring neuroprotection, such as inhibition of microglial activity and apoptosis pathways. In a small pilot study in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, minocycline treatment produced favorable outcomes in terms of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and clinical course. Further studies are needed to establish whether experimental neuroprotection strategies involving these mechanisms may be translated into preventing neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis.

We previously showed that iron plays a central role in the toxicity of dopamine (DA) to oligodendrocyte progenitors. Here, we further explore the mechanisms involved in DA toxicity, specifically the role of superoxide and the glutathione system. DA induces accumulation of superoxide, membrane damage and loss in cell viability. An iron chelator, deferoxamine, reduces superoxide accumulation. However, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTBAP, potentiates DA toxicity, suggesting that superoxide plays an indirect role in toxicity through dismutation to H2O2- In addition, the glutathione (GSH) analog (GME), blocks DA-induced superoxide accumulation, heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and caspase-3 activation, and reduces cell death, while the glutathione synthetase inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine, potentiates DA-induced HO-1 expression and cell death. Moreover, a mimetic of the peroxide-scavenging enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), ebselen, blocks caspase-3 activation induced by DA alone or in combination with iron. In conclusion, superoxide and inadequate defense by glutathione and GPx are responsible for the susceptibility of oligodendrocyte progenitors to DA toxicity. Furthermore, peroxides play a primary role in toxicity induced by DA and iron. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reliability of intracortical and corticomotor excitability estimates obtained from the upper extremities in chronic stroke	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Annual Meeting of the Organization-for-Human-Brain-Mapping	JUN 12-16, 2005	Toronto, CANADA	Org Human Brain Mapping		TMS; motor excitability; stroke; rehabilitation; intrasubject reliability	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY; CONSTRAINT-INDUCED THERAPY; INPUT-OUTPUT PROPERTIES; SILENT PERIOD; FOLLOW-UP; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SUBACUTE STROKE; FORCED-USE	We estimated the trial-to-trial variability and the test-retest reliability of several intracortical and corticomotor excitability parameters for the upper extremity in chronic stroke patients. Nine patients with hemiparesis of the upper extremity were enrolled 8-17 months after a unilateral stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to obtain repeated measures over a two week interval of motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curves and cortical silent periods in the first dorsal interosseus muscle of each hand. Five trials would have provided accurate estimates of the MEP amplitude and silent period duration for the unlesioned side in all patients, but 25% of the datasets from the lesioned side provided poor estimates of MEP amplitude even with 10 trials. Intraclass correlations were > 0.70 for all parameters obtained from the lesioned side and for the MEP amplitude, slope of the recruitment curve, silent period, and silent period slope from the unlesioned side. MEP amplitude varied across sessions within subject by 20% on both sides, whereas other parameters showed less variability on the unlesioned side relative to the lesioned side. The Fugl-Meyer upper extremity motor score and the time to complete the 6 fine-motor items from the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) were also found to be highly reliable over this interval. We conclude that the functional and most of the excitability parameters are reliable across time in patients with variable lesions due to stroke. Due to high intrasubject variability, the use of some excitability parameters as indicators of functional neuroplasticity in response to treatment may be limited to interventions with large effect sizes.

Chronic angle-closure glaucoma secondary to a suprachoroidal effusion induced by central retinal vein occlusion	OPHTHALMIC SURGERY LASERS & IMAGING			English	Article								A 68-year-old woman presented to the ophthalmology emergency clinic with a painful left eye of a few hours' duration. One month prior, the patient had presented with a central retinal vein occlusion in the same eye. Examination revealed an intraocular pressure of 32 mm Hg in the left eye with 360 degrees angle closure unaltered by indentation, a patent iridectomy from a previous combined phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy surgery, and no evident iris or angle neovascularization. Ultrasound biomicroscopic examination revealed a large suprachoroidal effusion with anterior rotation of the ciliary body and secondary angle closure in the left eye. The patient underwent successful pars plana vitrectomy, radial optic neurotomy, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection, and goniosynechialysis.

Critical hyperbilirubinemia is uncommon but has the potential for causing long-term neurological impairment. Early discharge of the healthy newborn infant, particularly those in whom breastfeeding may not be fully established, may be associated with delayed diagnosis of significant hyperbilirubinemia. Guidelines for the prediction, prevention, identification, monitoring and treatment of severe hyperbilirubinemia are presented.

ASIC3 in muscle mediates mechanical, but not heat, hyperalgesia associated with muscle inflammation	PAIN			English	Article						pain; acid; proton; ion; nociceptor; carrageenan	SENSING ION CHANNELS; RAT DORSAL-HORN; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; FUNCTIONAL REORGANIZATION; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; SENSORY NEURONS; PAIN; NOCICEPTION; CARRAGEENAN; EXPRESSION	Peripheral initiators of muscle pain are virtually unknown, but likely key to development of chronic pain after muscle insult. The current study tested the hypothesis that ASIC3 in muscle is necessary for development of cutaneous mechanical, but not heat, hyperalgesia induced by muscle inflammation. Using mechanical and heat stimuli, we assessed behavioral responses in ASIC3-/- and ASIC3+/+ mice after induction of carrageenan muscle inflammation. ASIC3-/- mice did not develop cutaneous mechanical hyperalgesia after muscle inflammation when compared to ASIC3+/+ mice; heat hyperalgesia developed similarly between groups. We then tested if the phenotype could be rescued in ASIC3-/- mice by using a recombinant herpes virus vector to express ASIC3 in skin (where testing occurred) or muscle (where inflammation occurred). Infection of mouse DRG neurons with ASIC3-encoding virus resulted in functional expression of ASICs. Injection of ASIC3-encoding virus into muscle or skin of ASIC3-/- mice resulted in ASIC3 mRNA in DRG and protein expression in DRG and the peripheral injection site. Injection of ASIC3-encoding virus into muscle, but not skin, resulted in development of mechanical hyperalgesia similar to that observed in ASIC3+/+ mice. Thus, ASIC3 in primary afferent fibers innervating muscle is critical to development of hyperalgesia that results from muscle insult. (c) 2006 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Multivariate searches for single top quark production with the D0 detector	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							FERMILAB-TEVATRON; HADRON COLLIDERS; ROOT-S=1.96 TEV; PAIR PRODUCTION; CROSS-SECTION; COLLISIONS; DECAY; PHYSICS; EVENTS; QCD	We present a search for electroweak production of single top quarks in the s-channel (p (p) over bar -> t (b) over bar +X) and t-channel (p (p) over bar -> tq (b) over bar +X) modes. We have analyzed 230 pb(-1) of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of root s=1.96 TeV. No evidence for a single top quark signal is found. We set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross sections, based on binned likelihoods formed from a neural network output. The observed (expected) limits are 6.4 pb (4.5 pb) in the s-channel and 5.0 pb (5.8 pb) in the t-channel.

Pharmacological treatment of neurogenic detrusor hyperactivity: intradetrusor botulinum toxin A injections	PROGRES EN UROLOGIE			French	Article; Proceedings Paper	100th Congress of the Association-Francaise-d-Urologie	2006	Paris, FRANCE	Assoc Francaise Urol		botulinum toxin; incontinence; urinary retention; benign prostatic hyperplasia; neurogenic bladder	SPINAL-CORD LESIONS; NEUROTOXIN TYPE-A; URINARY-INCONTINENCE; VOIDING DYSFUNCTION; OVERACTIVITY; BLADDER; EXPERIENCE; CHILDREN; MYELOMENINGOCELE; HYPERREFLEXIA	Botulinum toxins are among the most powerful of all natural poisons. They are responsible for human botulism and constitute potential chemical weapons, but are nevertheless used as therapeutic agents in an increasing number of indications and medical specialties. Botulinum toxins were used for the first time in urology by intrasphincteric injection by Dykstra in 1988 to treat detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in spinal cord injury patients. Schurch performed the first intradetrusor injections in 2000 to treat incontinence due to overactive bladder in adult spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis patients. This review of the literature presents the results and level of proof for the use of botulinum toxin intradetrusor injection to treat neurogenic voiding disorders. Botulinum toxin A intradetrusor injections constitute a safe, conservative, reversible and short-term effective (6-12 months) alternative after failure of anticholinergic therapy for overactive bladder and its clinical consequences in adult spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis patients (level 1b) and in children with neural tube defects (level 4). The efficacy of the first injection appears to be maintained at subsequent injections (up to 10 cycles) (level 4). Convergent and longer-term data are necessary to document and more clearly define the medium- and long-term efficacy profile of this approach, currently considered to be a major progress in neurourology.

MAC Battery is a Canadian instrument constructed to evaluate right hemisphere communicative and linguistic abilities, considering four processing domains: discoursive, pragmatic-inferential, lexical-semantic and prosodic. The participants were six translators, three specialist judges, 54 non-specialist judges and 16 subjects from pilot studies. Adaptation procedures included translation, judge analysis of psycholinguistics criteria and two pilot tests. Some tasks required a harder stimulus adaptation process - Metaphor interpretation, Narrative discourse and Semantic judgement - focusing a main finality: to keep each task's objective as idealized in the original instrument. This neuropsychological test can be used to evaluate communication abilities of patients with right brain damage, frontal lesion, traumatic brain injury and dementia.

Nightmare pathogenesis remains unexplained, as do differences between nontraumatic and posttraumatic nightmares (for those with or without posttraumatic stress disorder) and relations with waking functioning. No models adequately explain nightmares nor have they been reconciled with recent developments in cognitive neuroscience, fear acquisition, and emotional memory. The authors review the recent literature and propose a conceptual framework for understanding a spectrum of dysphoric dreaming. Central to this is the notion that variations in nightmare prevalence, frequency, severity, and psychopathological comorbidity reflect the influence of both affect load, a consequence of daily variations in emotional pressure, and affect distress, a disposition to experience events with distressing, highly reactive emotions. In a cross-state, multilevel model of dream function and nightmare production, the authors integrate findings on emotional memory structures and the brain correlates of emotion.

J	Nielsen, TA; Levin, R				Nielsen, Tore A.; Levin, Ross			The dimensional nature of disturbed dreaming: Reply to Weiss (2007)	PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN			English	Editorial Material						nightmares; distress; neurophysiology of fear memory; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychopathology	DSM-V; NIGHTMARES; DISORDERS	The authors' proposed model of nightmare formation withstands several criticisms raised in an accompanying commentary article (D. S. Weiss, 2007). A principal criticism, that the model lacks convergent and divergent validity, appears to stem from the commenter's application of a strong categorical, as opposed to the authors' use of a dimensional, approach to the model/construct of nightmares. Furthermore, ongoing research continues to support the authors' assumptions about the basic relationship between nightmares and affect distress. Other criticisms of the model, including a failure to account for robust epidemiological differences in nightmares and an ambiguity in the concept of affect distress, are also countered by reference to relevant research findings.

Differential engagement of anterior cingulate cortex subdivisions for cognitive and emotional function	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						fMRI; anterior cingulate; functional connectivity; cognition; emotion; stroop	EVENT-RELATED FMRI; REGIONAL BRAIN ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; STROOP TASK; ATTENTIONAL SELECTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; COUNTING STROOP; AMYGDALA; PERFORMANCE; CONFLICT	Functional differentiation of dorsal (dACC) and rostral (rACC) anterior cingulate cortex for cognitive and emotional function has received considerable indirect support. Using fMRI, parallel tasks, and within-subject analysis, the present study directly tested the proposed specialization of ACC subdivisions. A Task x Region interaction confirmed more dACC activation during color-word distractors and more rACC activation during emotion-word distractors. Activity in ACC subdivisions differentially predicted behavioral performance. Connectivity with prefrontal and limbic regions also supported distinct dACC and rACC roles. Findings provide direct evidence for differential engagement of ACC subdivisions in cognitive and emotional processing and for differential functional connectivity in the implementation of cognitive control and emotion regulation. Results point to an anatomical and functional continuum rather than segregated operations.

The interdependence of spatial attention and lexical access as revealed by early asymmetries in occipito-parietal ERP activity	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						spatial attention; lexical access; N2pc; semantic processing	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; HUMAN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; BLINK; INFORMATION; SEARCH; N400	A test of the possible functional interaction between mechanisms subserving spatial attention and lexical access was devised by displaying one green and one red string of letters, one to the left and one to the right of fixation, and having participants attend to a target string defined by color while ignoring the other distractor string. The target string for a delayed lexical decision task could be a word or a nonword. The distractor was always a word. When the target was a word, target and distractor were associatively related on half of the trials and not related in the other trials. The event-related potential time-locked to the onset of the letter strings produced an N2pc (a greater negativity at scalp sites contralateral to the target relative to the ipsilateral sites arising at about 170 ms poststimulus). N2pc amplitude was reduced when the words were related relative to when they were not related. The results provide direct, online evidence that the rapid activation of meaning by visual words can influence the efficiency of the deployment of spatial attention.

Its use in everyday activities requires its careful positioning relative to the arm and fine adjustments of the fingers to secure the object in the hand to perform a desired task. Understanding the mechanics of prehension requires an appreciation of the anatomy, biomechanics, kinematics, and control of the hand. This article summarizes these complex mechanisms as well as the central nervous system control of hand movement. We propose a measure to characterize the biomechanics of palmar arch modulation during grasping. We also highlight questions to be investigated in future studies to stimulate further understanding of the motor control of hand function and of the recovery of hand functioning after neurological injury.

These systems include the ventral hippocampus, which is involved in context and focus on tasks, the amygdalla, which mediates emotional behavior, and the prefrontal cortex, which modulates activity throughout the limbic system to enable behavioral flexibility. Each of these systems has overlapping projections to the nucleus accumbens, where these inputs are integrated under the modulatory influence of dopamine. Here, we provide a systems-oriented approach to interpreting the function of the dopamine system, its modulation of limbic-cortical interactions and how disruptions within this system might underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and drug abuse.

Memory traces of pain in human cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						pain; sensory discrimination; working memory; fMRI; somatosensory cortex; prefrontal cortex	PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; SINGLE-TRIAL FMRI; WORKING-MEMORY; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL NETWORK; INSULAR CORTEX; NEURAL CODES	Distinct brain regions process sensory discriminative and affective components of pain; however, the role of these areas in pain memory is unknown. This event-related study investigated the short-term memory for sensory features of cutaneous heat pain using a delayed-discrimination paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging. During memory trials, subjects discriminated the location and intensity of two painful stimuli presented sequentially to the right hand. Control trials comprised the same sequence of stimuli and motor responses but required no delayed discrimination. Stimulus-evoked activity for memory and control trials was generally indistinguishable within the network of regions normally responsive to experimental pain [i.e., the primary somatosensory cortex/posterior parietal cortex (SI/PPC), secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), and anterior insular cortex (aIC)]; these data confirm the painful nature of the stimuli and the similar levels of attention and stimulus encoding engaged during the two randomly presented trial types. Memory-specific activity, assessed by contrasting the interstimulus interval in memory and control trials, was observed in SI/PPC and aIC but not in SII. We propose that SI/PPC plays a role in the short-term retention of spatial and intensity aspects of noxious stimuli and that aIC activation during memory trials is consistent with the integration of sensory and cognitive (attention, awareness, salience, and memory) components of pain perception. The absence of memory-specific anterior cingulate cortex activation, generally associated with pain unpleasantness, suggests that remembering affective aspects of the stimuli was not required during performance of the sensory delayed-discrimination task.

Aristaless-related homeobox gene, the gene responsible for west syndrome and related disorders, is a groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split dependent transcriptional repressor	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ARX; X-linked mental retardation; transcription repression; polyalanine tract expansion; mutation; MRX	LINKED MENTAL-RETARDATION; TRACT EXPANSION; ARX; FOREBRAIN; MUTATIONS; DOMAINS; GROUCHO; MOUSE; CELL; ACTIVATOR	Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) is an important paired-type homeobox gene involved in the development of human brain. The ARX gene mutations are a significant contributor to various forms of X-chromosome-linked mental retardation with and without additional features including epilepsy, lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, hand dystonia or autism. Here we demonstrate that the human ARX protein is a potent transcriptional repressor, which binds to Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) cofactor proteins and the TLE1 in particular through its octapeptide (Engrailed homology repressor domain (eh-1) homology) domain. We show that the transcription repression activity of ARX is modulated by two strong repression domains, one located within the octapeptide domain and the second in the region of the polyalanine tract 4, and one activator domain, the aristaless domain. Importantly, we show that the transcription repression activity of ARX is affected by various naturally occurring mutations. The introduction of the c.98T > C (p.L33P) mutation results in the lack of binding to TLE1 protein and relaxed transcription repression. The introduction of the two most frequent ARX polyalanine tract expansion mutations increases the repression activity in a manner dependent on the number of extra alanines. Interestingly, deletions of alanine residues within polyalanine tracts I and 2 show low or no effect. In summary we demonstrate that the ARX protein is a strong transcription repressor, we identify novel ARX interacting proteins (TLE) and offer an explanation of a molecular pathogenesis of some APX mutations, including the most frequent ARX mutations, the polyalanine tract expansion mutations, c.304ins(GCG)(7) and c.428_451dup.

Identification of a novel functional specificity signal within the GPI anchor signal sequence of carcinoembryonic antigen	JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article							INTERCELLULAR-ADHESION MOLECULE; GLYCOSYL-PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL; MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; IG SUPERFAMILY; DIFFERENTIATION; PROTEINS; FAMILY; ATTACHMENT; MEMBRANE; GLYCOPROTEIN	Exchanging the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor signal sequence of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) for the signal sequence of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) generates a mature protein with NCAM external domains but CEA-like tumorigenic activity. We hypothesized that this resulted from the presence of a functional specificity signal within this sequence and generated CEA/NCAM chimeras to identify this signal. Replacing the residues (GLSAG) 6-10 amino acids downstream of the CEA anchor addition site with the corresponding NCAM residues resulted in GPI-anchored proteins lacking the CEA-like biological functions of integrin modulation and differentiation blockage. Transferring this region from CEA into NCAM in conjunction with the upstream proline (PGLSAG) was sufficient to specify the addition of the CEA anchor. Therefore, this study identifies a novel specificity signal consisting of six amino acids located within the GPI anchor attachment signal, which is necessary and sufficient to specify the addition of a particular functional GPI anchor and, thereby, the ultimate function of the mature protein.

Extracellular recordings were carried out in anesthetized Long Evans rats. Neurons in these layers had simple-like and complex-like receptive fields (RFs). Most cells (67%) had RFs showing band-pass and low-pass spatial frequency (SF) tuning profiles. Spatial band-pass profiles showed low optimal SF (mean= 0.03 c/deg), low spatial resolution (mean=0.18 c/deg) and large spatial bandwidths (mean=2.3 octaves). More than two-thirds of the RFs (71%) were selective to orientation and only 11% were clearly direction selective. Nearly two-thirds of cells (68%) had band-pass temporal frequency (TF) tuning profiles with narrow bandwidths (mean = 1.7 oct.) whereas the others showed low-pass TF tuning profiles. Temporal band-pass profiles had low optimal TFs (mean=3.5 Us). Although some cells showed relatively low contrast thresholds (6%), most cells only responded to high contrast values (mean= 38.2%). These results show that the spatial resolution of collicular cells is poor and that they respond mainly to highly contrasted moving stimuli. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simultaneous labeling of projecting neurons and apoptotic state	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						retrograde labeling; retinal ganglion cells; optic nerve; apoptosis; axon labeling	RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; DEATH; AXOTOMY; TRACERS	We describe a straightforward method that accomplishes both the labeling of projecting neurons and the identification of apoptosis in those neurons. A single dye, 4 ',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), is both retrogradely transported and binds DNA. When delivered to the sites of neuronal projections, DAPI travels via retrograde transport from neuronal projections to the soma and stain nuclei with little or no cytoplasmic labeling. The staining of the nuclei allows for visualization of their morphological characteristics; DAPI-stained living cells appear markedly different from DAPI-stained apoptotic cells, due to the nuclear changes that apoptotic cells undergo. This technique has been successfully employed with retinal ganglion cells in the retinocollicular pathway. The use of a single dye not only eliminates the need for secondary staining for apoptosis, but also allows for the use of a wider variety of non-overlapping fluorescent dyes for other studies.

This conditioned neurochemical response is believed to prompt drug seeking in animals and has been hypothesized to contribute to drug craving and relapse in substance abusers. In the present study, we used positron emission tomography and [C-11] raclopride to investigate whether amphetamine-predictive stimuli can elicit striatal dopamine release in humans. Nine healthy male volunteers received a capsule containing amphetamine tablets (0.3 mg/kg) on three separate occasions approximately every other day (mean +/- SD, 2.25 +/- 1.13 d apart) in the same environment (scanner suite). At least 2 weeks later, the amphetamine was switched to a placebo of identical appearance and given in the same environmental context. [C-11] Raclopride binding to dopamine D-2/3 receptors was assessed after exposure to the first amphetamine-containing pill, after placebo administration, and during a control (no pill) scan. Relative to the control scan, amphetamine administration decreased [C-11] raclopride binding potential by 22% in the ventral striatum and 11% in the putamen. Placebo also decreased [C-11] raclopride binding potential in the ventral striatum and did so with the same amplitude as amphetamine (23%). These results suggest that cues associated with amphetamine increase dopamine transmission, providing evidence that this system is involved in reward prediction in humans.

JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						pain; fibromyalgia; functional disorders; voxel-based morphometry; brain anatomy; aging	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; CHRONIC BACK-PAIN; MRI DATA; DENSITY; VOLUME; CLASSIFICATION; MECHANISMS; REDUCTION; INTENSITY	Fibromyalgia is an intractable widespread pain disorder that is most frequently diagnosed in women. It has traditionally been classified as either a musculoskeletal disease or a psychological disorder. Accumulating evidence now suggests that fibromyalgia may be associated with CNS dysfunction. In this study, we investigate anatomical changes in the brain associated with fibromyalgia. Using voxel-based morphometric analysis of magnetic resonance brain images, we examined the brains of 10 female fibromyalgia patients and 10 healthy controls. We found that fibromyalgia patients had significantly less total gray matter volume and showed a 3.3 times greater age-associated decrease in gray matter than healthy controls. The longer the individuals had had fibromyalgia, the greater the gray matter loss, with each year of fibromyalgia being equivalent to 9.5 times the loss in normal aging. In addition, fibromyalgia patients demonstrated significantly less gray matter density than healthy controls in several brain regions, including the cingulate, insular and medial frontal cortices, and parahippocampal gyri. The neuroanatomical changes that we see in fibromyalgia patients contribute additional evidence of CNS involvement in fibromyalgia. In particular, fibromyalgia appears to be associated with an acceleration of age-related changes in the very substance of the brain. Moreover, the regions in which we demonstrate objective changes may be functionally linked to core features of the disorder including affective disturbances and chronic widespread pain.

Actin filaments mediate mechanical gating during osmosensory transduction in rat supraoptic nucleus neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hypothalamus; supraoptic nucleus; electrophysiology; osmoreceptor; actin cytoskeleton; vasopressin	INTRACELLULAR IONIC-STRENGTH; REGULATED ANION CHANNELS; MEMBRANE SKELETON; SENSORY NEURONS; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; F-ACTIN; CELLS; VASOPRESSIN; MECHANOTRANSDUCTION; OSMOREGULATION	Osmosensory transduction is a bidirectional process displayed by neurons involved in the control of thirst and antidiuretic hormone release, and is therefore crucial for body fluid homeostasis. Although this mechanism is known to involve the activation of nonselective cation channels during hypertonicity-evoked shrinking, and the inhibition of these channels during hypotonicity-evoked swelling, the basis for this regulation is unknown. Here, we investigated this process using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from neurons acutely isolated from the supraoptic nucleus of adult rats. The mechanosensitivity index, defined as the ratio of conductance change to normalized volume change, was quantitatively equivalent whether cell volume was increased or decreased by changes in extracellular fluid osmolality, or by changes in pipette pressure. Moreover, responses induced by hyperosmotic or hypo-osmotic media could be reversed by increasing or decreasing pipette pressure, respectively. The mechanosensitivity index was significantly reduced in neurons treated with cytochalasin-D, a compound that promotes the depolymerization of actin filaments. Conversely, cells treated with jasplakinolide, a compound that promotes actin polymerization, showed a significant increase in mechanosensitivity index. Finally, the depolarizing and excitatory effects of hypertonic stimuli were significantly enhanced by jasplakinolide and reduced by cytochalasin-D. We conclude that osmosensory transduction in these neurons is a reversible mechanical process that depends on an intact actin cytoskeleton, and the sensitivity of the transducer appears to vary in proportion with the density of actin filaments.

J	Wile, D; Balaban, E				Wile, Daryl; Balaban, Evan			An Auditory Neural Correlate Suggests a Mechanism Underlying Holistic Pitch Perception	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Current theories of auditory pitch perception propose that cochlear place (spectral) and activity timing pattern (temporal) information are somehow combined within the brain to produce holistic pitch percepts, yet the neural mechanisms for integrating these two kinds of information remain obscure. To examine this process in more detail, stimuli made up of three pure tones whose components are individually resolved by the peripheral auditory system, but that nonetheless elicit a holistic, "missing fundamental" pitch percept, were played to human listeners. A technique was used to separate neural timing activity related to individual components of the tone complexes from timing activity related to an emergent feature of the complex (the envelope), and the region of the tonotopic map where information could originate from was simultaneously restricted by masking noise. Pitch percepts were mirrored to a very high degree by a simple combination of component-related and envelope-related neural responses with similar timing that originate within higher-frequency regions of the tonotopic map where stimulus components interact. These results suggest a coding scheme for holistic pitches whereby limited regions of the tonotopic map (spectral places) carrying envelope- and component-related activity with similar timing patterns selectively provide a key source of neural pitch information. A similar mechanism of integration between local and emergent object properties may contribute to holistic percepts in a variety of sensory systems.

Several of these proteins are also expressed in the mature brain, and notably in the hippocampus, where EphA4 and ephrins have been shown to influence dendritic spine morphology and long-term potentiation (LTP). To examine the cellular and subcellular localization of EphA4 in adult rat ventral hippocampus, we used light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with a specific polyclonal antibody against EphA4. After immunoperoxidase labeling, EphA4 immunoreactivity was found to be enriched in the neuropil layers of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus. In all examined layers of these regions, myelinated axons, small astrocytic leaflets, unmyelinated axons, dendritic spines, and axon terminals were immunolabeled in increasing order of frequency. Neuronal cell bodies and dendritic branches were immunonegative. EphA4-labeled dendritic spines and axon terminals corresponded to 9-19% and 25-40% of the total number of spines and axon terminals, respectively. Most labeled spines were innervated by unlabeled terminals, but synaptic contacts between two labeled elements were seen. The vast majority of synaptic junctions made by labeled elements was asymmetrical and displayed features of excitatory synapses. Immunogold labeling of EphA4 was located mostly on the plasma membrane of axons, dendritic spines, and axon terminals, supporting its availability for surface interactions with ephrins. The dual preferential labeling of EphA4 on pre- or postsynaptic specializations of excitatory synapses in adult rat hippocampus is consistent with roles for this receptor in synaptic plasticity and LTP.

Phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha inhibits general translation but selectively stimulates translation of ATF4, a repressor of CREB-mediated late-LTP (L-LTP) and LTM. We used a pharmacogenetic bidirectional approach to examine the role of eIF2 alpha phosphorylation in synaptic plasticity and behavioral learning. We show that in eIF2 alpha(+/S51A) mice, in which eIF2 alpha phosphorylation is reduced, the threshold for eliciting L-LTP in hippocampal slices is lowered, and memory is enhanced. In contrast, only early-LTP is evoked by repeated tetanic stimulation and LTM is impaired, when eIF2 alpha phosphorylation is increased by injecting into the hippocampus a small molecule, Sal003, which prevents the dephosphorylation of eIF2 alpha.

We have identified three mutations in the VANGL1 gene in patients with familial types (V239I and R274Q) and a sporadic type (M328T) of the disease, including a spontaneous mutation (V239I) appearing in a familial setting. In a protein-protein interaction assay V239I abolished interaction of VANGL1 protein with its binding partners, disheveled-1, -2, and -3. These findings implicate VANGL1 as a risk factor in human neural-tube defects.

Although the mechanisms governing neurodegeneration during HIV-1 infection remain uncertain, the HIV-1 accessory protein, viral protein R (Vpr), has been proposed as a neurotoxic protein. Herein, we report that Vpr protein and transcript were present in the brains of HIV-infected persons. Moreover, soluble Vpr caused neuronal apoptosis, involving cytochrome c extravasation, p53 induction, and activation of caspase-9 while exerting a depressive effect on whole-cell currents in neurons (p < 0.05), which was inhibited by iberiotoxin. Vpr-activated glial cells secreted neurotoxins in a concentration- dependent manner (p < 0.001). Transgenic (Tg) mice expressing Vpr in brain monocytoid cells displayed the transgene principally in the basal ganglia (p < 0.05) and cerebral cortex (p < 0.01) compared with hindbrain expression. Vpr was released from cultured transgenic macrophages, which was cytotoxic to neurons and was blocked by anti-Vpr antibody (p < 0.05). Neuronal injury was observed in Tg animals compared with wild-type littermates, chiefly affecting GAD65 (p < 0.01) and vesicular acetylcholine transferase (p < 0.001) immunopositive neuronal populations in the basal ganglia. There was also a loss of subcortical synaptophysin (p < 0.001) immunoreactivity as well as an increase in activated caspase-3, which was accompanied by a hyperexcitable neurobehavioral phenotype (p < 0.05). Thus, HIV-1 Vpr caused neuronal death through convergent pathogenic mechanisms with ensuing in vivo neurodegeneration, yielding new insights into the mechanisms by which HIV-1 injures the nervous system.

Activation of caspase-6 in aging and mild cognitive impairment	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; TAU; APOPTOSIS; PATHOLOGY; CLEAVAGE; NEURONS; PLAQUES; APP	Active caspase-6 (Csp6) and Tau cleaved by Csp6 (Tau Delta Csp6) are abundant in neuritic plaques (NPs) , neuropil threads (NPTs), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in end-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Guo H, Albrecht S, Bourdeau. M, Petzke T, Bergeron C, LeBlanc AC: Active caspase-6 and caspase-6 cleaved Tau in neuropil threads, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease. Am J Pathol 2004, 165:523-531). The goal of this study was to determine whether active Csp6 is present in young and aged noncognitively impaired (NCI); aged mild cognitively impaired (MCI); and aged mad, moderate, severe, and very severe AD individuals. Csp6 activity was assessed with anti-p2oCsp6 and Tau Delta Csp6 immunoreactivity. Active Csp6 is present in NFTs, NPTs, and NPs at all stages of AD. Active Csp6 is present in NFTs of all MCI cases and present in NPTs and NPs of some MCI cases. Active Csp6 is present in NFTs and NPTs of all NCI cases but is absent in younger cases. The level of Tau Delta Csp6-positive NFTs and NPTs correlates inversely with global cognitive scores in NCI individuals. Therefore, Csp6 activity can occur with aging in the absence of AD and is always associated with clinical and pathological features of confirmed AD cases. Given the ability of active Csp6 to increase amyloid-beta peptide production and cleave Tau and several synaptic proteins (LeBlanc AC, Liu H, Goodyer C, Bergeron C, Hammond J: Caspase-6 role in apoptosis of human neurons, amyloidogenesis and Alzheimer's disease.

Program No. 80.9. 2005 Abstract Viewer/Itinerary Planner. Washington, DC: Society for Neuroscience. Online), we suggest that active Csp6 could be an early instigator of neuronal dysfunction.

Nitric oxide production in the ventilatory muscles in response to acute resistive loading	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LUNG CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						nitrite; muscle contraction; diaphragm; nitric oxide synthases; nitrosothiols	ENDOTHELIAL NO SYNTHASE; HUMAN SKELETAL-MUSCLE; CONTRACTILE DYSFUNCTION; PROTEIN NITRATION; RAT DIAPHRAGM; UP-REGULATION; IN-VIVO; EXPRESSION; EXERCISE; CELLS	The effect of muscle activation on muscle nitric oxide ( NO) production remains controversial. Whereas NO release increases in in vitro activated muscles and in vivo limb muscles, diaphragmatic NO synthase ( NOS) activity declines after 3 h of inspiratory resistive loading ( IRL). We tested in this study the hypotheses that acute IRL decreases diaphragmatic NO derivatives levels and reduces protein expression of neuronal ( nNOS), endothelial ( eNOS), and inducible ( iNOS) NO synthases, as well as 3- nitrotyrosine formation. Anesthetized, tracheostomized, spontaneously breathing adult rats were subjected to IRL ( 50% of the maximum inspiratory pressure) for 1, 3, or 6 h. Quietly breathing rats served as controls. After 3 h of IRL, muscle eNOS and nNOS protein levels rose by 80 and 60% of control values, respectively. Whereas eNOS expression did not change any further, nNOS expression reached 550% of control values after 6 h of IRL. Strong iNOS protein expression was detected in the diaphragms after 6 h of IRL. Total NO derivatives levels in the diaphragm declined during IRL as a result of reduction in nitrate, nitrite, and nitrosothiols. Diaphragmatic protein tyrosine nitration decreased in response to IRL, and this reduction was mainly due to reduced tyrosine nitration of enolase and aldolase. We conclude that diaphragmatic NO derivatives levels decline in response to IRL and that the rise in diaphragmatic NOS protein expression may be a compensatory response designed to counterbalance the decline in NOS activity.

The effects of preexisting medical comorbidities on mortality and length of hospital stay in acute burn injury - Evidence from a national sample of 31,338 adult patients	ANNALS OF SURGERY			English	Article							RISK-FACTORS; THERMAL-INJURY; IMPACT; MORBIDITY; INDEX	Objective: To determine whether and to what extent preexisting medical comorbidities influence mortality risk and length of hospitalization in patients with acute burn injury. Summary Background Data: The effects on mortality and length of stay of a number of important medical comorbidities have not been examined in acute burn injury. Existing studies that have investigated the effects of medical comorbidities on outcomes in acute burn injury have produced inconsistent results, chiefly due to the use of relatively small samples from single burn centers. Methods: Records of 31,338 adults who were admitted with acute burn injury to 70 burn centers from the American Burn Association National Burn Repository, were reviewed. A burn-specific list of medical comorbidities was derived from diagnoses included in the Charlson Index of Comorbidities and the Elixhauser method of comorbidity measurement. Logistic regression was used to assess the effects of preexisting medical conditions on mortality, controlling for demographic and burn injury characteristics. Ordinal least squares regression with a logarithmic transformation of the dependent variable was used to assess the relationship of comorbidities with length of stay. Results: In-hospital mortality was significantly predicted by HIV/AIDS (odds ratio [OR] = 10.2), renal disease (OR = 5.1), liver disease (OR = 4.8), metastatic cancer (OR = 4.6), pulmonary circulation disorders (OR = 2.9), congestive heart failure (OR = 2.4), obesity (OR = 2.1), non-metastatic malignancies (OR = 2.1), peripheral vascular disorders (OR = 1.8), alcohol abuse (OR = 1.8), neurological disorders (OR = 1.6), and cardiac arrhythmias (OR = 1.5). Increased length of hospital stay among survivors was significantly predicted by paralysis (90% increase), dementia (60%), peptic ulcer disease (53%), other neurological disorders (52%), HIV/AIDS (49%), renal disease (44%), a psychiatric diagnosis (42%), cerebrovascular disease (41%), cardiac arrhythmias (40%), peripheral vascular disorders (39%), alcohol abuse (36%), valvular disease (32%), liver disease (30%), diabetes (26%), congestive heart failure (23%), drug abuse (20%), and hypertension (17%). Conclusions: A number of preexisting medical conditions influence outcomes in acute burn injury. Patients with preburn HIV/AIDS, metastatic cancer, liver disease, and renal disease have particularly poor prognoses.

These neurons have special membrane properties that allow them to generate rhythmical bursts of action potentials in the frequency range of natural mastication even when cut off from synaptic inputs. These properties mature during the third postnatal week in rats at the same time as mastication begins. Finally, we present evidence that a reduction on extracellular calcium concentration is an important step in the initiation of mastication. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In humans, SB is a repetitive sleep movement disorder mainly characterized by rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) at a frequency of 1 Hz and by occasional tooth grinding. Until recently, the mechanism by which RMMA and SB episodes are triggered has been poorly understood. It is reported that during light sleep, most SB episodes are observed in relation to brief cardiac and brain reactivations (3-15 s) termed "micro- arousals". We showed that RMMA are secondary to a sequence of events in relation to sleep micro-arousals: the heart (increase in autonomic sympathetic activity) and brain are activated in the minutes and seconds, respectively, before the onset of activity in suprahyoid muscles and finally by RMMA in jaw closing masseter or temporalis muscles. In non-human primate study, we have shown that the excitability of cortico-bulbar pathways is depressed during sleep; no rhythmic jaw movements (RJM) are observed following intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of cortical masticatory area (CMA) during sleep compared to the quiet awake state. The above results suggest that the onset of RMMA and SB episodes during sleep are under the influences of brief and transient activity of the brainstem arousal-reticular ascending system contributing to the increase of activity in autonomic-cardiac and motor modulatory networks.

METHODS We present four direct comparisons, where a nomogram was compared to either an ANN, a look-up table, a CART model or a RGS model. In all comparisons we assessed the predictive accuracy and performance characteristics of both models. RESULTS Nomograms have several advantages over ANN, look-up tables, CART and RGS models, the most fundamental being a higher predictive accuracy and better performance characteristics. CONCLUSION These results suggest that nomograms are more accurate and have better performance characteristics than their alternatives. However, ANN, look-up tables, CART analyses and RGS models all rely on methodologically sound and valid alternatives, which should not be abandoned.

We investigated whether this vaccination after a first episode of acute CNS inflammatory demyelination in childhood increased the risk of conversion to multiple sclerosis. We studied the French Kid Sclerose en Plaques (KIDSEP) neuropaediatric cohort of patients enrolled between 1994 and 2003 from their first episode of acute CNS inflammatory demyelination (inclusion in the cohort) until the occurrence of a second episode, up to 2005. A Cox proportional hazards model of time-dependent vaccine exposure was used to evaluate the effect of vaccination (hepatitis B, tetanus) during follow-up on the risk of second episode occurrence (conversion to multiple sclerosis). The cohort included 356 subjects with a mean follow-up of 5.8 years (SD 2.7). Relapse occurred in 146 (41%) subjects during follow-up; 33 subjects were exposed to hepatitis B vaccine and 28 to tetanus vaccine at some time during follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for relapse occurring within 3 years of hepatitis B vaccination was 0.78 (0.32-1.89) and during any time period was 1.09 (0.53-2.24). The adjusted HR for relapse occurring within 3 years of tetanus vaccination was 0.99 (0.58-1.67) and during any time period was 1.08 (0.63-1.83). We conclude that vaccination against hepatitis B or tetanus after a first episode of CNS inflammatory demyelination in childhood does not appear to increase the risk of conversion to multiple sclerosis, although the possibility of a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.

This report describes two experiments which compared how listeners with and without focal right hemisphere damage (RHD) rate speaker attitudes of "confidence" and "politeness" which are signalled in large part by prosodic features of an utterance. The RHD listeners displayed abnormal sensitivity to both the expressed confidence and politeness of speakers, underscoring a major role for the right hemisphere in the processing of emotions and speaker attitudes from prosody, although the source of these deficits may sometimes vary.

Seventeen PD participants and healthy controls (HQ completed a series of neuropsychological tests and performed a metaphor comprehension task following the methods of Gernsbacher and colleagues [Gernsbacher, M. A., Keysar, B., Robertson, R. R. W., & Werner, N. K. (2001). The role of suppression and enhancement in understanding metaphors. Journal of Memory and Language, 45, 433-450.] When participants in the PD group were identified as "impaired" or "unimpaired" relative to the control group on a measure of verbal working memory span, we found that only PD participants with impaired working memory were simultaneously impaired in the processing of metaphorical language. Based on our findings we argue that certain "complex" forms of language processing such as metaphor interpretation are highly dependent on intact fronto-striatal systems for working memory which are frequently, although not always, compromised during the early course of PD.

J	Albert, M; Antel, J; Bruck, W; Stadelmann, C				Albert, Monika; Antel, Jack; Brueck, Wolfgang; Stadelmann, Christine			Extensive cortical remyelination in patients with chronic multiple sclerosis	BRAIN PATHOLOGY			English	Article							OLIGODENDROCYTE PRECURSOR CELLS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; WHITE-MATTER; LESIONS; DEMYELINATION; CNS; PATHOLOGY; PLAQUES; BRAIN; AXONS	Recent studies revealed prominent cortical demyelination in patients with chronic multiple sclerosis (MS). Demyelination in white matter lesions is frequently accompanied by remyelination. This repair process, however, often remains incomplete and restricted to the lesion border. In the present study, we examined the frequency and extent of remyelination in cortical and white matter lesions in autopsy brain tissue of 33 patients with chronic MS. The majority of patients (29 of 33) harbored cortical demyelination. Remyelination of cortical lesions was identified light microscopically by the presence of thin and irregularly arranged myelin sheaths, and confirmed by electron microscopy. Extensive remyelination was found in 18%, remyelination restricted to the lesion border in 54%, and no remyelination in 28% of cortical lesions. A direct comparison of the extent of remyelination in white matter and cortical lesions of the same patients revealed that remyelination of cortical lesions was consistently more extensive. In addition, g-ratios of fibers in areas of "normal appearing cortex" yielded values consistent with remyelination. Our data confirm the high prevalence of cortical demyelination in chronic MS and imply that the propensity to remyelinate is high in cortical MS lesions.

In a previous study, we demonstrated the ability of S. suis serotype 2 to adhere to and invade immortalized porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMECs) forming the blood-brain barrier. The aim of the current work was to further characterize the mechanism(s) by which S. suis invades porcine endothelial cells. The ability of several S. suis strains to interact with PBMECs was not found to correlate with their geographic origin, virulence, host of origin, or suilysin production. Characterization studies demonstrated that proteinaceous adhesins/invasins, cell wall components, lipoteichoic acid, and serum components (including fibronectin) were involved in interactions between S. suis and PBMECs. In addition to PBMECs, S. suis was able to adhere to and invade 2 porcine aortic endothelial cell lines and primary PBMECs.

We investigated the associations between serum levels of IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 and glioma risk. A nested case-control study was conducted within a cancer prevention study, including 29,133 men (ages 50-69 years). In total, 22 glioma cases and 400 randomly selected controls were included. Serum samples were collected a minimum of 5 years before cancer diagnosis. Serum concentrations were measured using ELISA and divided into tertiles based on measurements among controls. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the lowest tertile as the reference category. No statistical association was detected between glioma and IGF-binding protein-3. IGF-I was inversely associated with glioma when comparing the lowest tertile with the other tertiles combined (odds ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.7). The results encourage future research on IGFs in relation to brain tumors in larger studies.

Their etiology is quite complex involving environmental and genetic factors and their underlying molecular and cellular pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Animal studies have recently demonstrated an essential role for the planar cell polarity pathway (PCP) in mediating a morphogenetic process called convergent extension during neural tube formation. Alterations in members of this pathway lead to NTDs in vertebrate models, representing novel and exciting candidates for human NTDs. Genetic studies in NTDs have focused mainly on folate-related genes based on the finding that perinatal folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of NTDs by 60-70%. A few variants in these genes have been found to be significantly associated with an increased risk for NTDs. The candidate gene approach investigating genes involved in neurulation has failed to identify major causative genes in the etiology of NTDs. Despite this history of generally negative findings, we are achieving a rapid and impressive progress in understanding the genetic basis of NTDs, based mainly on the powerful tool of animal models.

We identified and collected DNA from individuals from nine families of seven different nationalities in which the affected individuals meet the diagnostic criteria for CIP. Using homozygosity mapping and haplotype sharing methods, we narrowed the CIP locus to chromosome 2q24-q31, a region known to contain a cluster of voltage-gated sodium channel genes. From these prioritized candidate sodium channels, we identified 10 mutations in the SCN9A gene encoding the sodium channel protein Na(v)1.7. The mutations completely co-segregated with the disease phenotype, and nine of these SCN9A mutations resulted in truncation and loss-of-function of the Na(v)1.7 channel. These genetic data further support the evidence that Na(v)1.7 plays an essential role in mediating pain in humans, and that SCN9A mutations identified in multiple different populations underlie CIP.

Proper evaluations must be undertaken to understand the sensorimotor impairments underlying locomotor disorders post stroke, so that evidence-based interventions can be developed. The current electrophysiological, biomechanical, and imagery evaluations that provide insight into locomotor dysfunction post stroke, as well as their advantages and limitations, are reviewed in this paper. In particular, electrophysiological evaluations focus on the contrast of electromyographic patterns and integrity of spinal reflex pathways during perturbed and unperturbed locomotion between persons with stroke and healthy individuals. At a behavioral level, biomechanical evaluations that include temporal distance factors, kinematic and kinetic analyses, as well as the mechanical energy and metabolic cost, are useful when combined with electrophysiological measures for the interpretation of gait disturbances that are related to the control of the central nervous system or secondary to biomechanical constraints. Finally, current methods in imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation can provide further insight into cortical control of locomotion and the integrity of the corticospinal pathways.

Neural networks in the form of self-organizing maps (SOMs; Kohonen, 1989, 1995) were used to simulate unsupervised learning of Mandarin tones. In Simulation 1, we trained the SOMs with syllable-sized continuous F(0) contours, produced by multiple speakers in connected speech, and with the corresponding velocity profiles (D1). No attempt was made to reduce the large amount of variability in the input or to add to the input any abstract features such as height and slope of the F(0) contours. In the testing phase, reasonably high categorization rate was achieved with F(0) profiles, but D1 profiles yielded almost perfect categorization of the four tones. Close inspection of the learned prototypical D1 profile clusters revealed that they had effectively eliminated surface variability and directly reflected articulatory movements toward the underlying targets of the four tones as proposed by Xu and Wang (2001). Additional simulations indicated that a further learning step was possible through which D1 prototypes with one-to-one correspondence to the tones were derived from the prototype clusters learned in Simulation 1. Implications of these findings for theories of language acquisition, speech perception and speech production are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, we found that agrin acts as one such synaptogenic factor at neuronal synapses in the PNS by demonstrating that structural synapse formation is impaired in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of z+ agrin-deficient mice and in SCG cultures derived from those animals. Here, we tested whether synaptic function is defective in agrin-null (AGD-/-) ganglia and began to define agrin's mechanism of action. Our electrophysiological recordings of compound action potentials showed that presynaptic stimulation evoked action potentials in approximate to 40% of AGD-/- ganglionic neurons compared to 90% of wildtype neurons; moreover, transmission could not be potentiated as in wild-type or z+ agrin-deficient ganglia. Intracellular recordings also showed that nerve-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials in AGD-/- neurons were only 1/3 the size of those in wild-type neurons and mostly subthreshold. Consistent with these defects in transmission, we found an approximate to 40-50% decrease in synapse number in AGD-/- ganglia and cultures, and decreased levels of differentiation at the residual synapses in culture. Furthermore, surface levels of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) were equivalent in cultured AGD-/- and wild-type neurons, and depolarization reduced the synaptic localization of AChRs in AGD-/- but not wild-type neurons. These findings provide the first direct demonstration that agrin is required for proper structural and functional development of an interneuronal synapse in vivo. Moreover, they suggest a novel role for agrin, in stabilizing the postsynaptic density of nAChR at nascent neuronal synapses. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Dorsal raphe 5-HT and locus coeruleus NE neurons were recorded in vivo in mice lacking NK1 receptors in wildtype mice pretreated with the NK1 antagonist RP67580 and its inactive enantiomer RP 68651. RP67580 and RP68651 were also tested on 5-HT neurons of mice tacking the 5-HT1A receptor. RP67580 increased the firing rate of 5-HT neurons in witdtype mice and in 5-HT1A null mutant mice to the same degree, thus indicating that the mechanism by which NK1 antagonists enhances 5-HT firing is independent of 5-HT1A receptors. NE neuronal burst activity was increased in NK1 null mutant and wildtype mice given RP67580, but not with RP68651. After NE depletion, RP67580 was ineffective in increasing 5-HT neuronal firing activity in NK1 wildtype mice, and the enhancement of 5-HT neuronal firing observed in NK1 null mutant mice was abolished. In conclusion, NE neurons are essential for the action of NK1 antagonists on 5-HT neurons. In addition, the desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors produced by NK1 receptor antagonism is not critical for enhancing 5-HT neuronal firing. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. and ECNR All rights reserved.

Disparate growth at this site has been thought to lead to pedicle asymmetry, which then causes vertebral rotation and ultimately, the development of scoliotic curves. The objectives of this study are (1) to incorporate pedicle growth and growth modulation into an existing finite element model of the thoracic and lumbar spine already integrating vertebral body growth and growth modulation; (2) to use the model to investigate whether pedicle asymmetry, either alone or combined with other deformations, could be involved in scoliosis pathomechanisms. The model was personalized to the geometry of a nonpathological subject and used as the reference spinal configuration. Asymmetry of pedicle geometry (i.e. initial length) and asymmetry of the pedicle growth rate alone or in combination with other AIS potential pathogenesis (anterior, lateral, or rotational displacement of apical vertebra) were simulated over a period of 24 months. The Cobb angle and local scoliotic descriptors (wedging angle, axial rotation) were assessed at each monthly growth cycle. Simulations with asymmetrical pedicle geometry did not produce significant scoliosis, vertebral rotation, or wedging. Simulations with asymmetry of pedicle growth rate did not cause scoliosis independently and did not amplify the scoliotic deformity caused by other deformations tested in the previous model. The results of this model do not support the hypothesis that asymmetrical NCJ growth is a cause of AIS. This concurs with recent animal experiments in which NCJ growth was unilaterally restricted and no scoliosis, vertebral wedging, or rotation was noted.

Subjects (n = 23) explored pairs of two-dimensional (2-D) angles (standard angle, 90 degrees; comparison angles, 91 degrees-103 degrees) placed at arm's length from the subject, and identified the larger angle of each pair. The exploratory strategies included a reference condition, dynamic scan of the index finger over the entire object [combined cutaneous and proprioceptive (shoulder) feedback], and modified conditions, static touch of the intersection of the two bars that formed the angle using the index finger (cutaneous feedback) and dynamic scans of the object using a hand-held tool (proprioceptive feedback, shoulder). Discrimination thresholds (75% correct) were very similar for dynamic and static touch with the index finger. Thresholds varied as a function of the static contact duration (< 1 s, 7.2 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees; similar to 3 s, 4.2 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees), but were not different from the reference condition (6.0 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees). The higher threshold with short static touch likely reflects movement-related gating of self-generated tactile inputs. Together, the results suggested that cutaneous feedback alone may be sufficient to explain 2-D angle discrimination, because the added proprioceptive feedback did not improve performance. Also, threshold did not vary with the number of dynamic scans (one or two), suggesting that the critical information was gathered on the first pass over the angle. In contrast, when the angles were explored with the tool, the threshold increased relative to the corresponding reference condition from the same session (tool, 9.6 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees; dynamic scan with the finger, 6.2 degrees +/- 1.0 degrees). Thus, performance was poorer with proprioceptive feedback alone, suggesting that cutaneous feedback was relatively more important for 2-D haptic angle discrimination in the present experiment.

Postural control following a self-initiated reaching task in type 2 diabetic patients and age-matched controls	GAIT & POSTURE			English	Article						functional reach; center of pressure; posture; dynamic balance; diabetes	SEMMES-WEINSTEIN MONOFILAMENT; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; SENSORY NEUROPATHY; FUNCTIONAL REACH; BODY SWAY; BALANCE; STABILITY; INSTABILITY; MECHANISMS; STEADINESS	Although the postural stability of diabetic patients is affected in the presence of polyneuropathy, it has been suggested that diabetes per se has no effect on balance control during quiet standing. However, recent studies have reported muscular mechanical deficits in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) that may be highlighted during a more destabilizing task than quiet standing. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare non-diabetic and T2D subjects during a modified version of the functional reach (FR) test in order to discriminate differences in postural control associated with diabetes per se. Thirty subjects (15 non-diabetic and 15 T2D) were requested to stand on a force platform and to perform the FIR test. Center of pressure velocity (V-cop), root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude and range of the COP were calculated in the anterior-posterior direction during three specific periods of the FR performance: namely "before", "on-going" and "after". No significant difference between the non-diabetic subjects and the T2D subjects was found for the FIR performance. However, T2D subjects had significantly higher V-cop, RMS and range of COP displacements for the "after" period compared to the non-diabetic group (p < 0.05). These results suggest that T2D subjects without peripheral neuropathy may have difficulties regaining their stability after a self-initiated reaching task. Therefore, diabetes mellitus per se, could have a direct effect on postural control during standing after a self-induced forward reaching movement. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They become activated following neurological insults and increase their expression of cytokines. Also elevated in CNS injuries are proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs). The spectrum of metalloproteinase members expressed by microglia and by the systemic leukocytes that infiltrate the injured CNS is unknown, as are their functions. We determined the levels of transcripts encoding all 24 MMPs, nine ADAMs, and their four physiological antagonists, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), in human microglia, B and T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. We found a distinct pattern for each immune subset and an enrichment of metalloproteinases in microglia compared with leukocytes. When microglia were activated, there was an upregulation of transcripts for nine metalloproteinases, and reduction of TIMP3. Activation of microglia also resulted in increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-10 protein in the conditioned media of cells. The amount of secreted TNF-alpha, but not IL-1 beta or IL-10, was suppressed by 131394, a broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor, and by TIMP3 but not TIMP1 or TIMP2. This inhibitory profile suggests the involvement of an ADAM member in TNF-alpha secretion. We conclude that microglia bear a metalloproteinase signature distinct from systemic cells, and that following activation, microglia upregulate TNF-alpha protein levels through a combination of elevated cytokine transcripts, increased metalloproteinase level and activity, and through the decrease of TIMP3. The results have implications for the regulation of neuroinflammation and its outcomes following CNS injuries. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Design: Two groups of 200-day-old UM-X7.1 CMH received daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant bovine (rb) GH (1 mg/kg/day) or 0.9% NaCl for 40 days. Golden Syrian hamsters (GSH) were used as controls. At 240-day-old, the hamsters were randomly subjected to (i) assessment of left ventricular systolic function in a Langendorff perfused mode followed by the determination of the passive diastolic pressure-volume relationship and morphometric measurements; (ii) assessment of left ventricular mRNA expression of genes belonging to the fetal gene program including atrial (ANP) and brain (BNP) natriuretic peptides and cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms and of the circulating levels of the natriuretic peptides. Results: Hearts from CMH were hypertrophied and dilated (p<0.05) compared to hearts from GSH, along with a similar to 10-fold increase in the circulating ANP and BNP levels. Left ventricular BNP and ANP mRNAs were elevated by 2- and 3-fold, respectively, compared to GSH. rbGH reduced both ANP mRNA and ANP circulating levels by 34% (p<0.01) but did not significantly modulate BNP levels. This effect was associated with a preserved systolic function and reverse remodeling as assessed by a leftward shift of the passive diastolic pressure-volume relationship indicating reduced ventricular dilatation. Conclusions: The data show that a short-term administration of GH in the terminal phase of the disease confers cardioprotection by attenuating systolic dysfunction and by inducing beneficial reverse remodeling.

In contrast to global image models such as the active appearance model (AAM), the PBM consists of a collection of localized image regions, referred to as parts, whose appearance, geometry and occurrence frequency are quantified statistically. The parts-based approach explicitly addresses the case where one-to-one correspondence does not exist between all subjects in a population due to anatomical differences, as model parts are not required to appear in all subjects. The model is constructed through a fully automatic machine learning algorithm, identifying image patterns that appear with statistical regularity in a large collection of subject images. Parts are represented by generic scale-invariant features, and the model can, therefore, be applied to a wide variety of image domains. Experimentation based on 2-D MR slices shows that a PBM learned from a set of 102 subjects can be robustly fit to 50 new subjects with accuracy comparable to 3 human raters. Additionally, it is shown that unlike global models such as the AAM, PBM fitting is stable in the presence of unexpected, local perturbation.

To our knowledge, there have been no previous studies aimed at answering the important question of whether there are differences in cholesterol within the brains of suicide completers. In the present study, cholesterol content was measured in cortical and subcortical tissue of brains from 41 male suicide completers and 21 male controls that died of sudden causes with no direct influence on brain tissue. No significant differences in cholesterol content were found between suicides and controls in the frontal cortex, amygdala or hippocampus. However, when the suicide completers were stratified into violent (n = 31) or non-violent (n = 10) groups based on the method of death, violent suicides were found to have lower grey-matter cholesterol content overall compared to non-violent suicides [F(1,111)=4.75, p=0.031, specifically in the frontal cortex (t=-4.16, d.f.=37, p < 0.0005). Further exploration of the frontal cortex revealed that violent suicides had lower cholesterol content compared to non-violent suicides in the orbitofrontal cortex (t= -2.01, d.f.=36, p=0.05) and the ventral prefrontal cortex (t= -2.49, d.f.=37, p=0.02). This study represents the first direct examination of cholesterol content in brain tissue from suicide completers, and the present findings provide added support for the relationship between low cholesterol and violent or suicidal behaviour.

Cortical deficits in human amblyopia: Their regional distribution and their relationship to the contrast detection deficit	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; STRIATE CORTEX NEURONS; MACAQUES VISUAL-SYSTEM; EARLY UNILATERAL BLUR; STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; NEURAL BASIS; CONVERGENT STRABISMUS; BINOCULAR INTERACTION; FUNCTIONAL AMBLYOPIA	PURPOSE. The understanding of the site and nature of the cortical processing deficit in human amblyopia awaits the resolution of three fundamental questions about which there is, at present, much controversy: First, is area VI affected as the present animal models would predict, but some imaging studies argue against? Second, bow extensive is the loss of extrastriate function, and does it simply follow as a consequence of an impaired V1 input? Third, does the brain imaging deficit, be it striate or extrastriate, correlate with the well-documented psychophysical loss?-a fundamental issue on which previous brain imaging studies are divided. METHODS. A spatially broadband stimulus was used to determine the functional MRI responses from the different retinotopically identified visual cortical areas in a group of normal (n = 6) and a group of amblyopic (n = 11) observers. Responses were compared between the amblyopic and fellow fixing eyes of amblyopes and between the dominant and nondominant eyes of normal subjects, in central and peripheral parts of the visual field. Psychophysical acuity and contrast sensitivity was also measured and its correlation with the brain imaging deficit determined. RESULTS. V1 was affected in most but not all cases; the brain-imaging deficit involved extensive regions of extrastriate cortex and, at least with the stimuli used in the study, correlated with the VI loss, suggesting a strong VI influence; and neither the striate nor the extrastriate deficits correlated with the psychophysical contrast threshold losses at either high or low spatial frequencies. CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest that there are significant suprathreshold processing deficits that are not a consequence of the well-known threshold deficit. Our preoccupation over the past 30 years with the contrast detection deficit in amblyopia limited to the processing within a circumscribed part of VI may have to be modified to include not only processing deficits for high-contrast stimuli but also the involvement of multiple extrastriate areas.

In contrast to GBM in adults (aGBM), little is known about the mechanisms underlying its development. Our aim is to gain insight into the molecular pathways of pGBM. Materials and Methods Thirty-two pGBM and seven aGBM samples were investigated using biochemical and transcriptional profiling. Ras and Akt pathway activation was assessed through the phosphorylation of downstream effectors, and gene expression profiles were generated using the University Health Network Human 19K cDNA arrays. Results were validated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and compared with existing data sets on aGBM. Results There are at least two subsets of pGBM. One subset, associated with Ras and Akt pathway activation, has very poor prognosis and exhibits increased expression of genes related to proliferation and to a neural stem-cell phenotype, similar to findings in aggressive aGBM. This subset was still molecularly distinguishable from aGBM after unsupervised and supervised analysis of expression profiles. A second subset, with better prognosis, is not associated with activation of Akt and Ras pathways, may originate from astroglial progenitors, and does not express gene signatures and markers shown to be associated with long-term survival in aGBM. Both subsets of pGBM show overexpression of Y-box-protein-1 that may help drive oncogenesis in this tumor. Conclusion Our work, the first study of gene expression profiles in pGBM, provides valuable insight into active pathways and targets in a cancer with minimal survival, and suggests that these tumors cannot be understood exclusively through studies of aGBM.

However, despite the ubiquity of such an embodied strategy, the issue of whether there is a neural link between numbers and fingers in adult, literate individuals remains debated. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to study changes of excitability of hand muscles of individuals performing a visual parity judgment task, a task not requiring counting, on Arabic numerals from 1 to 9. Although no modulation was observed for the left hand muscles, an increase in amplitude of motor-evoked potentials was found for the right hand muscles. This increase was specific for smaller numbers (I to 4) as compared to larger numbers (6 to 9). These findings indicate a close relationship between hand/finger and numerical representations.

Our previous work used immunoprecipitation to show that caveolin-1 can interact with p-gp. In this study, we provide evidence that caveolin-1 regulates p-gp transport activity in a rat brain endothelial cell line (RBE4). Down-regulation of caveolin-1 by siRNA reduced the interaction between p-gp and caveolin-1, followed by a decrease in [H-3]-Taxol and [H-3]-Vinblastine accumulation in RBE4 cells. The latter result showed that down-regulation of caveolin-1 enhanced p-gp transport activity. RBE4 cells were also transfected with Sarcoma in order to modulate caveolin-1 phosphorylation. Overexpression of Sarcoma, a protein tyrosine kinase, stimulated caveolin-1 phosphorylation and increased both [H-3]-Taxol and [H-3]-Vinblastine accumulation as well as Hoechst 33342 accumulation. Transfection of caveolin-1 inhibits p-gp transport activity. Conversely, transfection of the mutant cavY14F decreased the p-gp/caveolin-1 interaction and reduced accumulation of the two p-gp substrates. Thus, our data show that caveolin-1 regulates p-gp function through the phosphorylation state of caveolin-1 in endothelial cells from the blood-brain barrier.

Eye, head, and body coordination during large gaze shifts in rhesus monkeys: Movement kinematics and the influence of posture	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; NECK MUSCLES; SUBCORTICAL CONTRIBUTIONS; VARIABLE INTERACTIONS; EXPRESS SACCADES; VOLUNTARY EYE; HUMANS; PRIMATE	Coordinated movements of the eye, head, and body are used to redirect the axis of gaze between objects of interest. However, previous studies of eye-head gaze shifts in head-unrestrained primates generally assumed the contribution of body movement to be negligible. Here we characterized eye-head-body coordination during horizontal gaze shifts made by trained rhesus monkeys to visual targets while they sat upright in a standard primate chair and assumed a more natural sitting posture in a custom-designed chair. In both postures, gaze shifts were characterized by the sequential onset of eye, head, and body movements, which could be described by predictable relationships. Body motion made a small but significant contribution to gaze shifts that were >= 40 degrees in amplitude. Furthermore, as gaze shift amplitude increased (40-120 degrees), body contribution and velocity increased systematically. In contrast, peak eye and head velocities plateaued at velocities of similar to 250-300 degrees/s, and the rotation of the eye-in-orbit and head-on-body remained well within the physical limits of ocular and neck motility during large gaze shifts, saturating at similar to 35 and 60 degrees, respectively. Gaze shifts initiated with the eye more contralateral in the orbit were accompanied by smaller body as well as head movement amplitudes and velocities were greater when monkeys were seated in the more natural body posture. Taken together, our findings show that body movement makes a predictable contribution to gaze shifts that is systematically influenced by factors such as orbital position and posture. We conclude that body movements are part of a coordinated series of motor events that are used to voluntarily reorient gaze and that these movements can be significant even in a typical laboratory setting. Our results emphasize the need for caution in the interpretation of data from neurophysiological studies of the control of saccadic eye movements and/or eye-head gaze shifts because single neurons can code motor commands to move the body as well as the head and eyes.

Eligible patients were randomized to slow-release morphine plus DM or slow-release-morphine plus placebo. The initial DM dose was 60 mg four times daily for seven days, with an increase to 120 mg four times daily, if tolerated, for another seven days. During the study, patients recorded medications and scores for pain, nausea, drowsiness, and insomnia. Sixty-five patients were randomized. Although average pain scores (12.6 vs. 15.8), number of breakthrough doses (9 vs. 11.3), and change in total morphine consumption (550.9 mg vs. 597.1 mg) were less in the DM group than placebo group, the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.31-0.33). Side-effect, scores were not statistically significantly different. Dizziness was greater in the DM (58%) than placebo (36%) group. This study showed a statistically nonsignificant enhancement of analgesia or modulation of opioid tolerance in cancer patients with pain when DM was added to morphine. Participants receiving the DM also had more toxicity, particularly dizziness. This toxicity and the limited evidence of effect do not support the use of DM to enhance opioid analgesia or to modulate opioid tolerance in cancer patients.

As sleep is the predominant behavioral state in the term and especially the preterm newborn, these data underline the importance of respecting sleep duration and organization within the different sleep states. Polysomnography is the preferred technique used for identification of sleep state; however, behavioral observations-under the condition that the observer is well trained-may prove as efficient. Newborns hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit are exposed to many stimuli and care activities that disrupt their sleep organization and may have irreversible effects on their brain development. In order to improve the long-term neurobehavioral outcome of these high-risk subjects, a consistent care approach is proposed. Application of the Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program decreases environmental stressful events and promotes harmonious well-being behaviors, based on an individual approach. This strategy has encouraging results, showing an increase in sleep duration under Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program conditions, but further studies are needed to assess its long-term neurobehavioral impact.

Inhibition of acrolein-induced apoptosis by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							CELL-DEATH; OXIDATIVE STRESS; NEUTROPHIL APOPTOSIS; CYTOCHROME-C; GLUTATHIONE; CYTOTOXICITY; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; DISEASE	Acrolein is a highly electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde to which humans are exposed in many situations. It is an environmental pollutant that is responsible for multiple respiratory diseases and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The hypothesis of the study is that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of glutathione, could protect cells against acrolein-induced apoptosis. Exposure of Chinese hamster ovary cells to a noncytotoxic dose of acrolein (4 fmol/cell) depleted intracellular glutathione to 45% of initial levels. NAC, which increased intracellular glutathione levels by 30%, afforded protection against acrolein-induced cytotoxicity (loss of cell proliferation) and apoptosis. NAC protected against apoptosis by diminishing acroleininduced activation of the mitochondrial death pathway. NAC inhibited acrolein-induced Bad translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria, as well as Bcl-2 translocation from mitochondria to the cytosol, as evaluated by Western blot analysis. However, NAC had no effect on acrolein- induced Bax translocation to mitochondria and cytochrome c liberation into the cytosol. Meanwhile, NAC inhibited depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, as evaluated by rhodamine fluorescence using flow cytometry. NAC also inhibited procaspase-9 processing, activation of enzymatic activity of caspase-9, -7, and -8, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage induced by acrolein. Inhibition of acrolein-induced apoptosis using NAC was confirmed morphologically by diminished condensation of nuclear chromatin, as evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. These findings suggest that NAC could be potentially useful as a protective agent for people exposed to acrolein.

Mucus secretion by single tracheal submucosal glands from normal and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator knockout mice	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							HUMAN AIRWAY CELLS; VASOACTIVE-INTESTINAL-PEPTIDE; INDUCED LIQUID SECRETION; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; SENSORY NEUROPEPTIDES; SUBSTANCE-P; DIESEL EXHAUST; LUNG INFECTION; INFLAMMATION; BICARBONATE	Submucosal glands line the cartilaginous airways and produce most of the antimicrobial mucus that keeps the airways sterile. The glands are defective in cystic fibrosis (CF), but how this impacts airway health remains uncertain. Although most CF mouse strains exhibit mild airway defects, those with the C57Bl/6 genetic background have increased airway pathology and susceptibility to Pseudomonas. Thus, they offer the possibility of studying whether, and if so how, abnormal submucosal gland function contributes to CF airway disease. We used optical methods to study fluid secretion by individual glands in tracheas from normal, wild-type (WT) mice and from cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) knockout mice (Cftr(m1UNC)/Cftr(m1UNC); CF mice). Glands from WT mice qualitatively resembled those in humans by responding to carbachol and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), although the relative rates of VIP- and forskolin-stimulated secretion were much lower in mice than in large mammals. The pharmacology of mouse gland secretion was also similar to that in humans; adding bumetanide or replacement of HCO3- by Hepes reduced the carbachol response by similar to 50%, and this inhibition increased to 80% when both manoeuvres were performed simultaneously. It is important to note that glands from CFTR knockout mice responded to carbachol but did not secrete when exposed to VIP or forskolin, as has been shown previously for glands from CF patients. Tracheal glands from WT and CF mice both had robust secretory responses to electrical field stimulation that were blocked by tetrodotoxin. It is interesting that local irritation of the mucosa using chili pepper oil elicited secretion from WT glands but did not stimulate glands from CF mice. These results clarify the mechanisms of murine submucosal gland secretion and reveal a novel defect in local regulation of glands lacking CFTR which may also compromise airway defence in CF patients.

In the mouse, homozygous Pax2 inactivation results in renal agenesis, a phenotype that has largely precluded the analysis of Pax gene function during metanephric kidney development. To address this later function, kidney development was analyzed in embryos that were compound heterozygous for Pax2 and for Pax8, a closely related member of the Pax gene family. Both genes are coexpressed in differentiating nephrons and collecting ducts. At the morphological level, Pax2(+/-)Pax8(+/-) metanephric kidneys are severely hypodysplastic and characterized by a reduction in ureter tips and nephron number in comparison with wild-type or Pax2(+/-) kidneys. In developing nephrons, the molecular analysis of Pax2(+/-)PaxS(+/-) kidneys reveals a strong reduction in the expression levels of Lim1, a key regulator of nephron differentiation, accompanied by an increase in apoptosis. At a more mature stage, the reduction of Pax2/8 gene dosage severely affects distal tubule formation, revealing a role for Pax genes in the differentiation of specific nephron segments. At the ureter tips, the expression of Wnt11, a target of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor-Ret signaling, is significantly reduced, whereas the expression levels of Ret and GDNF remain normal. Together, these results demonstrate a crucial role for Pax2 and Pax8 in nephron differentiation and branching morphogenesis of the metanephros.

However, the specific isoform( s) of PKC that underlie( s) these events are often not known. We have used Aplysia as a model system in order to investigate the isoform specificity of PKC actions due to the presence of fewer isoforms and a large number of documented physiological roles for PKC in synaptic plasticity in this system. In particular, we have shown that distinct isoforms mediate distinct types of synaptic plasticity induced by the same neurotransmitter: The novel calcium-independent PKC Apl II is required for actions mediated by serotonin ( 5-HT) alone, while the classical calcium-dependent PKC Apl I is required for actions mediated when 5-HT is coupled to activity. We will discuss the reasons for PKC isoform specificity, assess the tools used to uncover isoform specificity, and discuss the implications of isoform specificity for understanding the roles of PKC in regulating synaptic plasticity.

Face recognition using localized features based on non-negative sparse coding	MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						face recognition; sparse-coding; non-negative representations; distance metrics	OBJECT REPRESENTATION	Neural networks in the visual system may be performing sparse coding of learnt local features that are qualitatively very similar to the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex, V1. In conventional sparse coding, the data are described as a combination of elementary features involving both additive and subtractive components. However, the fact that features can 'cancel each other out' using subtraction is contrary to the intuitive notion of combining parts to form a whole. Thus, it has recently been argued forcefully for completely non-negative representations. This paper presents Non-Negative Sparse Coding (NNSC) applied to the learning of facial features for face recognition and a comparison is made with the other part-based techniques, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Local-Non-negative Matrix Factorization (LNMF). The NNSC approach has been tested on the Aleix-Robert (AR), the Face Recognition Technology (FERET), the Yale B, and the Cambridge ORL databases, respectively. In doing so, we have compared and evaluated the proposed NNSC face recognition technique under varying expressions, varying illumination, occlusion with sunglasses, occlusion with scarf, and varying pose. Tests were performed with different distance metrics such as the L-1-metric, L-2-metric, and Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC). All these experiments involved a large range of basis dimensions. In general, NNSC was found to be the best approach of the three part-based methods, although it must be observed that the best distance measure was not consistent for the different experiments.

Studying the cooperatively breeding African cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, we show that dominant females were similar to dominant males in dominance behaviour, high testosterone levels and brain arginine vasotocin expression (a neuropeptide involved in vertebrate territorial, reproductive and social behaviours) compared to subordinate helpers, but had lower levels of 11-ketotestosterone than males. Furthermore, brain gene expression profiles of dominant females were most similar to those of the males (independent of social rank). Dominant breeder females are masculinized at the molecular and hormonal level while being at the same time reproductively competent, suggesting a modular organization of molecular and endocrine functions, allowing for sex-specific regulation.

Given evidence that the ER-embedded glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT) regulates glioblastoma cell survival and that MT1-MMP is a key enzyme in the cancer cell invasive phenotype, we explored the molecular link between G6PT and MT1-MMP. Cytoskeleton-disrupting agents such as concanavalin A (ConA) and cytochalasin D triggered proMMP-2 activation and cell death in U87 glioma cells. ConA decreased G6PT gene expression, an event that was also observed in cells overexpressing the full-length recombinant MT1-MMP protein. Overexpression of a membrane-bound catalytically active but cytoplasmic domain-deleted MT1-MMP was unable to downregulate G6PT gene expression or to trigger necrosis. Gene silencing of MT1-MMP with small interfering RNA prevented proMMP-2 activation and induced G6PT gene expression. ConA inhibited Akt phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of recombinant G6PT rescued the cells from ConA-induced proMMP-2 activation and increased Akt phosphorylation. Altogether, new functions of MT1-MMP in cell death signaling may be linked to those of G6PT. Our study indicates a molecular signaling axis regulating the invasive phenotype of brain tumor cells and highlights a new "bioswitch'' function for G6PT in cell survival.

Prevalence of vascular risk factors among Spanish populations aged 70 years and over, as reported in door-to-door studies on neurological diseases	NEUROLOGIA			English	Article						neurological studies; door-to-door; vascular risk factors	SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DEMENTIA; HYPERTENSION; SPAIN; ROTTERDAM; BIDASOA; EUROPE	Introduction. The aim of this study was to re-analyze door-to-door studies on neurological diseases among the elderly, in which vascular risk factors (VRF) were studied, describing methodological characteristics and prevalence of VRF. Methods. The surveys were identified in two phases. They were aimed at ascertaining prevalence of stroke, dementias or Parkinsonisms and, at the time of individual screening, had collected data on at least three of the following VRF: arterial hypertension (AHT), smoking habit, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. A questionnaire was drawn up to collect the data reported in each study, and a database was constructed. VRF prevalences were quantified and analyzed using logistic regression. Results. The total of the re-analyzed population was 12,510 persons aged 70 years and over, residents in seven geographic areas during the period 1994-2002. Information available on VRF was essentially self-reported. The prevalence of self-reported AHT was 25.7% in men and 44.2% in women, and that of measured AET was 61% and 71.9%, respectively. Populations with arterial pressure obtained by direct measurement registered higher risks (OR: 1.74; 95% Cl: 1.51-2.01, and OR: 1.48; 95% Cl: 1.33-1.64). Reported prevalence of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and smoking habit were 14.3%, 23.3% and 8.5%, respectively. Conclusions. There was a high prevalence of VRF among the Spanish elderly population. However, its relationship with dementia, Parkinsonisms and cerebrovascular disease could not be studied due to the poor quality of the VRF data. The differences between measured and self-reported arterial pressure suggest the existence of undetected AHT and wide scope for prevention.

Bath application of carbachol (CCh, 70-100 mu M) induced: (i) spontaneous and synchronous field oscillations (duration = up to 7 s) that were mirrored by intracellular depolarizations with rhythmic action potential bursts; and (ii) depolarizing plateau. potentials (DPPs, duration = up to 2.5 s) associated with action potential discharge in response to brief (50-100 ms) intracellular depolarizing current pulses. Ionotropic glutamatergic receptor antagonists abolished the field oscillations without influencing DPPs, while atropine (1 mu M) markedly reduced both types of activity. Topiramate (10-100 mu M, it = 8-13 slices) or lamotrigine (50-400 mu M, n = 3-12) decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and eventually abolished, CCh-induced field oscillations. During topiramate application, these effects were accompanied by marked DPP reduction. When these antiepileptic drugs were tested on DPPs recorded in the presence of CCh + ionotropic glutamatergic and GABA receptor antagonists, only topiramate reduced DPPs (n = 5-19/dose; IC50 - 18 mu M, n = 48). Similar effects were induced by topiramate during metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonism (n = 5), which did not influence DPPs. Thus, topiramate and lamotrigine reduce CCh-induced epileptiform synchronization in the rat subiculum but only topiramate is effective in controlling DPPs. We propose that muscarinic receptor-mediated excitation represents a target for the action of some antiepileptic drugs such as topiramate. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We sought to determine the clinical spectrum, survival, and long-term functional outcome of a cohort of pediatric patients with mitochondrial diseases and to identify prognostic factors. METHODS. Medical charts were reviewed for 73 children diagnosed between 1985 and 2005. The functional status of living patients was assessed prospectively by using the standardized Functional Independence Measure scales. RESULTS. Patients fell into 7 phenotypic categories: neonatal-onset lactic acidosis (10%), Leigh syndrome (18%), nonspecific encephalopathy (32%), mitochondrial (encephalo) myopathy (19%), intermittent neurologic (5%), visceral (11%), and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (5%). Age at first symptoms ranged from prenatal to 16 years ( median: 7 months). Neurologic symptoms were the most common (90%). Visceral involvement was observed in 29% of the patients. A biochemical or molecular diagnosis was identified for 81% of the patients as follows: deficiency of complex IV (27%), of pyruvate dehydrogenase or complex I (25% each), of multiple complexes (13%), and of pyruvate carboxylase (5%) or complexes II + III (5%). A mitochondrial DNA mutation was found in 20% of patients. At present, 46% of patients have died (median age: 13 months), 80% of whom were < 3 years of age. Multivariate analysis showed that age at first symptoms was a major independent predictor of mortality: patients with first symptoms before 6 months had a highly increased risk of mortality. Cardiac or visceral involvement and neurologic crises were not independent prognostic factors. Living patients showed a wide range of independence levels that correlated positively with age at first symptoms. Among patients aged > 5 years (n = 32), 62% had Functional Independence Measure quotients of > 0.75. CONCLUSIONS. Mitochondrial diseases in children span a wide range of symptoms and severities. Age at first symptoms is the strongest predictor mortality. Despite a high mortality rate in the cohort, 62% of patients aged > 5 years have only mild impairment or normal functional outcome.

The objective of this study was to determine whether children who sought care for a head injury were at greater risk of having a subsequent head injury within the following 6 and 12 months compared with children who sought care for an injury other than to the head. DESIGN/SETTING. This was a longitudinal cohort study conducted in the emergency departments of 2 Montreal (Quebec, Canada) pediatric hospitals. PARTICIPANTS. The parents of 11 867 injured children aged 1 to 18 years were interviewed by telephone at 6 (n = 10 315) and 12 (n = 9486) months after their child's injury to ascertain outcome (ie, subsequent head injury) and to provide information on potential risk factors (age, gender, chronic medical condition, activity level, and socioeconomic status). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. The outcome of interest was a head injury requiring medical attention within the following year ascertained by parental recall or physician claims data. RESULTS. A total of 245 and 386 previously head-injured children sustained a subsequent head injury within 6 and 12 months, respectively. Children who sought care for an initial head injury (n = 3599) were at higher risk of having a subsequent head injury within 6 months than children who sought care for an injury not to the head (n = 6716). The adjusted odds ratio suggested weak confounding by age, gender, and history of previous head injury. Results were consistent on the basis of physician claims data and 12-month follow-up interview data. CONCLUSIONS.

Immunohistochemical localization of a retinoic acid-like receptor in nerve cells of two colonial anthozoans (Cnidaria)	TISSUE & CELL			English	Article						Cnidaria; retinoic acid receptor; sensory cells; Ectoderm; Western blot; immunochemistry	X-RECEPTOR; RENILLA-KOELLIKERI; ECDYSONE RECEPTOR; NUCLEAR RECEPTORS; PATTERN-FORMATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; SYSTEM; CORAL; ULTRASPIRACLE; EVOLUTION	Retinoic acid is known to induce vertebrate stem cells to differentiate into a variety of cell types, including neurons. Although retinoic acid was reported to affect morphogenetic pattern specification in the hydrozoan Hydractinia (Muller, W.A., 1984. Retinoids and pattern formation in a hydroid. J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 81, 253-271) and a retinoid RXR receptor was cloned in the jellyfish Tripedalia (Kostrouch, Z., Kostrouchova, M., Love, W., Jannini, E., Piatigorsky, J., Rall, J.E., 1998. Retinoic acid X receptor in the diploblast, Tripedalia cystophora. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 95, 13442-13447), the cellular targets of retinoids were not investigated. We used Western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry to investigate the presence and cellular distribution of a RXR-like receptor in the sea pansy Renilla koellikeri and in the staghorn coral Acropora millepora (Cnidaria, Anthozoa). Western blots revealed a 64 kDa protein from a sea pansy extract in a band that co-migrated with a RXR protein from the rat brain. Using antibodies raised against an epitope of human alpha RXR, we visualized putative ectodermal sensory cells in the polyp column of the adult sea pansy. Immunoreactivity was absent in staghorn coral larvae but present in the polyp column of adult colonies in the form of clusters of neuron-like cells in the basiectoderm near the ectoderm-mesoglea interface. These observations suggest that a RXR-like receptor is involved in epithelial nerve cell specification in adult anthozoans and that this role is conserved throughout evolution. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Data for a series of 72 adult patients who underwent surgery for MTLE / HS were evaluated. Thirty-six patients underwent CAH and 36 SAH. All patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation before and 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: The intelligence quotient increased postoperatively in both surgical groups. Memory evaluation in the CAH group revealed a postoperative decline in nonverbal memory after right-sided resection and a postoperative decline in verbal memory after left-sided resection. In the SAH group, there was a slight postoperative decline only in verbal memory after left-sided resection, but other memory function was well preserved. However, no significant difference was found between two approaches regarding memory. There was no also statistically significant difference between two approaches in terms of seizure outcome at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in the clinical planning of seizure treatment, the optimal type of surgical approach is dependent on the outcome predictions, rather than on any supposed advantages to postoperative memory function.

We report what has been achieved and what can be expected in 2007 and in the future. We reviewed the literature to provide guidelines in terms of criteria, limitations and clinical value of nomograms in 2007. Further, we report a set of recent PCa nomograms, where certain criteria are listed which were used to develop each nomogram. Our findings suggest a demand for an update of nomograms as well as head-to-head comparisons to determine the best-suited model in select fields of PCa outcomes. In 2007 and the future, an increasing number of nomograms will address important endpoints such as PSA recurrence, local and distant metastases, or androgen-independent PCa-specific survival. Our results suggest that nomograms represent valid risk stratification models to achieve most accurate predictions. In 2007 and the future, more specific and refined nomograms will be available which address relevant clinical end points. Moreover, novel markers in PCa outcomes will be quantified using the nomogram approach.

Systematic literature review using Medline and Cancerlit from January 1997 to December 2006. Abstracts published in the journals European Urology, The Journal of Urology, The International Journal of Impotence Research and The Journal of Sexual Medicine as official proceedings of internationally known scientific Societies held in the same time period were also assessed. Patient selection and surgical technique (i.e., preservation of neurovascular bundles) are the major determinants of post-operative erectile function. Pharmacological treatment of post-operative ED, using either oral or local approaches, is effective and safe. Moreover, recent studies have shown that pharmacological prophylaxis early after RP can significantly improve the rate of erectile function recovery after surgery. Use of on-demand treatments for treatment of ED in patients subjected to RP has been shown to be highly effective, especially in case of properly selected young patients treated with a bilateral nerve-sparing approach by experienced surgeons. In this context, pharmacological prophylaxis may potentially have a significant expanding role in future strategies aimed at preserving post-operative erectile function.

To investigate the cerebral processing of sensory information from the trigeminal nerve in detail we studied subjects with and without olfactory function using functional magnetic resonance imaging. A normosmic group (n = 12) was compared with a group of anosmic subjects (n = 11). For trigeminal stimulation gaseous CO2 was used. Following right-sided stimulation with CO2 controls exhibited a stronger right-sided cerebral activation than anosmic subjects. Stronger activation was found in controls compared to anosmic subjects for the right prefrontal cortex, the right somatosensory cortex (SI), and the left parietal insula. In contrast, relatively higher activation was found in anosmic subjects for the left supplementary motor area in the frontal lobe, the right superior and middle temporal lobe, the left parahippocampal gyrus in the limbic lobe, and the sub-lobar region of the left putamen and right insula which was mostly due to a decreased BOLD signal of controls in these areas. Additional conjunction analysis revealed that activated areas common to the two groups were the cerebellum and the right premotor frontal cortex. These data suggest that the processing of the trigeminally mediated information is different in the presence or absence of an intact sense of smell, pointing towards the intimate connection between the two chemosensory systems.

The aim of the present study, therefore, was to examine the participation of primary visual cortex (V1) to auditory processing in early enucleated rats. Here we show, using gaussian noise bursts, that about a third of the cells in V1 responded to auditory stimulation in blind rats and most of these (78%) had ON-type responses and low spontaneous activity. Moreover, they were distributed throughout visual cortex without any apparent tonotopic organization. Optimal frequencies determined using pure tones were rather high but comparable to those found in auditory cortex of blind and sighted rats. On the other hand, sensory thresholds determined at these frequencies were higher and bandwidths were wider in V1 of the blind animals. Blind and sighted rats were also stimulated for 60 min with gaussian noise, their brains removed and processed for c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Results revealed that c-Fos positive cells were not only present in auditory cortex of both groups of rats but there was a 10-fold increase in labeled cells in V1 and a fivefold increase in secondary visual cortex (V2) of early enucleated rats in comparisons to sighted ones. Also, the pattern of distribution of these labeled cells across layers suggests that the recruitment of V1 could originate at least in part through inputs arising from the thalamus. The ensemble of results appears to indicate that cross-modal compensation leading to improved performance in the blind depends on cell recruitment in V1 but probably also plastic changes in lower- and higher-order visual structures and possibly in the auditory system.

In addition, Mchr1 KO mice on the C57BL/6J background were less anxious in the elevated plus-maze, while on the 129/SvEv background, the mutants were less emotionally reactive as estimated by fecal boli and handling-related vocalization. There was no detrimental impact of the null mutation on motor coordination and spatial learning. Mchr1 KO mice had shorter latencies before reaching the escape platform. but only on the 129/SvEv background. Null mutants were lighter than C57BL/6J controls but heavier than 129/SvEv controls, attributable to interactions with strain-dependent genes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Learning-related coordination of striatal and hippocampal theta rhythms during acquisition of a procedural maze task	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						basal ganglia; hippocampus; local field potential; oscillations; striatum	BASAL GANGLIA; DECLARATIVE MEMORY; PATH-INTEGRATION; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURAL BASIS; OSCILLATIONS; PLACE; SEQUENCES; CORTEX	The striatum and hippocampus are conventionally viewed as complementary learning and memory systems, with the hippocampus specialized for fact-based episodic memory and the striatum for procedural learning and memory. Here we directly tested whether these two systems exhibit independent or coordinated activity patterns during procedural learning. We trained rats on a conditional T-maze task requiring navigational and cue-based associative learning. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity with tetrodes chronically implanted in the caudoputamen and the CA1 field of the dorsal hippocampus during 6-25 days of training. We show that simultaneously recorded striatal and hippocampal theta rhythms are modulated differently as the rats learned to perform the T-maze task but nevertheless become highly coherent during the choice period of the maze runs in rats that successfully learned the task. Moreover, in the rats that acquired the task, the phase of the striatal-hippocampal theta coherence was modified toward a consistent antiphase relationship, and these changes occurred in proportion to the levels of learning achieved. We suggest that rhythmic oscillations, including theta-band activity, could influence not only neural processing in cortico-basal ganglia circuits but also dynamic interactions between basal ganglia-based and hippocampus-based forebrain circuits during the acquisition and performance of learned behaviors. Experience-dependent changes in coordination of oscillatory activity across brain structures thus may parallel the well known plasticity of spike activity that occurs as a function of experience.

Although this theory receives partial support from the finding that brain size limits the capacity of animals to behaviourally respond to environmental challenges, the hypothesis that large brains are associated with reduced mortality has never been empirically tested. Using extensive information on avian adult mortality from natural populations, we show here that species with larger brains, relative to their body size, experience lower mortality than species with smaller brains, supporting the general importance of the cognitive buffer hypothesis in the evolution of large brains.

They also suggest that the prehensile geometry of an object is integrated in the neural circuits and includes the object's graspable characteristics as well as its semantic properties. In order to determine whether there is a conjoined representation of the graspable characteristics of an object in relation to the actual grasping, it is necessary to separate the graspable (low-level) from the semantic (high-level) properties of the object. Right-handed subjects were asked to grasp and lift a smooth 300-g cylinder with one hand, before and after judging the level of difficulty of a "grasping for pouring'' action, involving a smaller cylinder and using the opposite hand.

This study profiled and investigated functionally candidate genes mediating this switch between cell survival and death during an acute inflammatory reaction subsequent to the absence of glucocorticoid signaling. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed that following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intracerebral administration at striatum level, more modulated genes presented transcription impairment than exacerbation upon glucocorticoid receptor blockage. Among impaired genes we identified ceruloplasmin (Cp), which plays a key role in iron metabolism and is implicated in a neurodegenative disease. Microglial and endothelial induction of Cp is a natural neuroprotective mechanism during inflammation, because Cp-deficient mice exhibited increased iron accumulation and demyelination when exposed to LPS and neurovascular reactivity to pneumococcal meningitis. This study has identified genes that can play a critical role in programming the innate immune response, helping to clarify the mechanisms leading to protection or damage during inflammatory conditions in the CNS.

J	Apuzzo, S; Gros, P				Apuzzo, Sergio; Gros, Philippe			Cooperative interactions between the two DNA binding domains of Pax3: Helix 2 of the paired domain is in the proximity of the amino terminus of the homeodomain	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							TUMOR ALVEOLAR RHABDOMYOSARCOMA; SPLOTCH MUTANT MOUSE; WAARDENBURG-SYNDROME; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; PBX HOMEODOMAIN; CROSS-LINKING; GENE; MUTATIONS; COMPLEX	Pax3 is a transcription factor that plays an important role during neurogenesis and myogenesis, and Pax3 mutant animals display neural tube defects and lack limb muscles. Pax3 harbors two DNA binding domains, the paired domain (PD) and a paired-type homeodomain (HD). Genetic and biochemical data have (i) identified strong cooperative interactions between the PD and HD domains for DNA binding in the intact Pax3 protein and (ii) suggested an important role for the amino-terminal portions of both domains in such cooperativity. We have studied proximity relationships between the PD and HD of Pax3. For this, we have used a cross-linking strategy with the bifunctional thiol reagent bismaleimidoethane (BMOE) in 21 mutants bearing pairs of cysteine residues (DCM) inserted in strategic locations of a functional Pax3 protein otherwise devoid of endogenous cysteine residues. All 21 DCMs were characterized for protein stability, for DNA binding by the PD and HD, and for the effect of BMOE on protein binding to PD, HD, or PD-HD combined DNA targets. BMOE-induced cross-links in DCMs were detected as slower migrating species on immunoblots. Mutants bearing double cysteine insertions (I59C/S222C, S73C/Q219C, and V78C/K218C) showed the most robust cross-linking upon BMOE exposure. These cross-linking studies suggest that portions of helix 1 (I59), helix 2 (S73), and the loop between helices 2 and 3 (V78) of the PD are in the proximity of the N-terminal segment of the HD (K218, Q219, and S222) in the tertiary structure of Pax3. These results are compatible with a model in which the PD and HD are organized in an everted arrangement, with the N-terminal portion of the PD being in the proximity of the N-terminus of the HD. This arrangement may be important for the noted PD-HD cooperativity in DNA binding.

Laminar fate of cortical GABAergic interneurons is dependent on both birthdate and phenotype	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						calretinin; parvalbumin; neurogenesis; telencephalon; somatosensory cortex; radial gradient	DEVELOPING CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RAT OCCIPITAL CORTEX; THYMIDINE-H-3 AUTORADIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; CAUDAL GANGLIONIC EMINENCE; LOCAL CIRCUIT NEURONS; IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; MIGRATORY PATHWAYS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX	Pioneering work indicates that the final position of neurons in specific layers of the mammalian cerebral cortex is determined primarily by birthdate. Glutamatergic projection neurons are born in the cortical proliferative zones of the dorsal telencephalon, and follow an "inside-out" neurogenesis gradient: later-born cohorts migrate radially past earlier-born neurons to populate more superficial layers. GABAergic interneurons, the major source of cortical inhibition, comprise a heterogeneous population and are produced in proliferative zones of the ventral telencephalon. Mechanisms by which interneuron subclasses find appropriate layer-specific cortical addresses remain largely unexplored. Major cortical interneuron subclasses can be identified based on expression of distinct calcium-binding proteins including parvalbumin, calretinin, or calbindin. We determined whether cortical layer-patterning of interneurons is dependent on phenotype. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons populate cortical layers with an inside-out gradient, and birthdate is isochronous to projection neurons in the same layers. In contrast, another major GABAergic subtype, labeled using calretinin, populates the cerebral cortex using an opposite "outside-in" gradient, heterochronous to neighboring neurons. In addition to birthdate, phenotype is also a determinant of cortical patterning. Discovery of a cortical subpopulation that does not follow the well-established inside-out gradient has important implications for mechanisms of layer formation in the cerebral cortex.

We have identified a splice variant of Dok-4, Dok-4b, which contains a 39 aa insert within the its C-terminal region. The similar to 45 kDa Dok-4b protein was detected in several human epithelial cell lines. Based on genomic sequences, Dok-4b was also predicted to exist in primates and possibly bovines, but not in rodents or other species. Compared to Dok-4, Dok-4b inhibited the tyrosine kinase-induced activation of both Erk and Elk-1 more strongly. Truncation of the C-terminal region of Dok-4 (Dok-4 ACT) also enhanced the inhibitory activity of Dok-4, whereas expression of the isolated C-terminal domain enhanced Elk-1 activation, suggesting that the N-terminus and C-terminus of Dok-4 possess opposing inhibitory and stimulatory properties, respectively, the balance of which is altered by alternative splicing of Dok-4 to Dok-b.

This study examined the possible role of sensory neurons and substance P in symptoms of an animal model of acute intestinal inflammation. The model was induced by injecting ethanol and zymosan into the colon of anesthetized male rats. Three hours later, sections of the colon were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To determine the role of substance P, 5 mg/kg of the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1r) antagonist, CP-96,345, or 300 mu g/kg of an antisense oligonucleotide targeted at NK-1r mRNA was administered. Spinal cord sections were examined for internalization of NK-1r, as an indicator of substance P release. Sections of colon revealed infiltration of inflammatory cells following ethanol and zymosan treatment. Plasma extravasation in rats given ethanol and zymosan was significantly greater than in controls given saline only (P < 0.0001) or saline and ethanol (P < 0.001). In ethanol- and zymosan-treated rats given CP-96,345, plasma extravasation was significantly less than in rats given ethanol and zymosan without the antagonist (P < 0.0001). Administration of the antisense oligonucleotide also resulted in lower levels of plasma extravasation compared with controls (P < 0.01). Internalization of the NK-1r was observed in neurons of lamina I in the T13-L2 and L6-S2 regions of the spinal cord, as well as in sympathetic preganglionic neurons at the L1 level. This internalization was observed in the absence of any other stimulus besides the inflammation itself. This study implicates substance P and its receptor, the NK-1r, in acute inflammation of the colon. (c) 2006 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Features of their dimerization have never been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that PAS domain function requires regions extending over the short PAS core repeats. Strikingly, while deleting PAS core repeats does not overtly affect dimerization, it abolishes the transcriptional activity of the heterodimer. Interestingly, these deletions also abolish codependent phosphorylation of CLOCK and BMAL 1, suggesting a link between the phosphorylation status of the heterodimer and its transactivation potential. We demonstrate that NPAS2 (neuronal PAS domain protein 2) and BMAL2 also undergo similar posttranslational modifications, thereby establishing the mechanism proposed for CLOCK-BMAL1 as a common feature of transcriptional activators in the circadian clock. The discovery of two novel splice variants of BMAL2 confirms the crucial role of the PAS domain and further strengthens the view that co-dependent phosphorylation is of functional significance. In agreement with this, we demonstrate that CRY 1-2 (cryptochromes 1-2) affect transactivation and phosphorylation of transcriptional activators of the clock. Furthermore, CRY proteins stabilize the unphosphorylated forms of BMAL1(BMAL2) thereby shifting the phosphorylated/unphosphorylated ratio towards a predominantly unphosphorylated (transcriptionally inactive) form. In contrast, PER proteins, which are weak repressors, are without effect. From these results, we propose a general mechanism for the inhibition of CLOCK(NPAS2)-BMAL1 (BMAL2) circadian transcriptional activation by CRY 1-2.

As a toxic by-product of lipid peroxidation, acrolein has been implicated as a possible mediator of oxidative damage to cells and tissues in a wide variety of disease states, including atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative and pulmonary diseases. Although acrolein can induce apoptotic cell death in various cell types, the biochemical mechanisms are not understood. This study investigates the implication of the death receptor pathway in acrolein-induced apoptosis. Exposure of Chinese hamster ovary cells to acrolein caused translocation of adaptor protein Fas associated with death domain to the cytoplasmic membrane and caspase-8 activation. Kp7-6, an antagonist of Fas receptor activation, blocked apoptotic events downstream of caspase-8, such as caspase-7 activation and nuclear chromatin condensation. Acrolein activated the cross-talk pathway between the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways. Bid was cleaved to truncated-Bid, which was translocated. to mitochondria. Activation of the mitochondrial pathway by acrolein was confirmed by caspase-9 activation. Inhibition of activation of either the Fas receptor or caspase-8 partially decreased acrolein-induced caspase-9 activation. These findings indicate that acrolein activates the Fas receptor pathway, which occurs upstream of the mitochondrial pathway. Caspase-9 activation still occurred despite inhibition of the Fas receptor pathway, suggesting that acrolein could also trigger the mitochondrial pathway independent of the receptor pathway. These findings improve our understanding of mechanisms of toxicity of the reactive aldehyde acrolein, which has widespread implications in multiple disease states which seem to be mediated by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.

Central oxidation of cholesterol to oxysterols has been implicated in neuroembryogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and membrane repair. In the current study, we demonstrated that transient transfection of rat astroglia with human (h)ho-l cDNA for 3 days significantly decreased intracellular cholesterol concentrations and increased levels of four oxysterol species (measured by GC/MS) compared to untreated control cultures and HO-1-transfected cells exposed to the HO inhibitor, tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP). Relative to control preparations, oxidative stress was augmented in mitochondria (isolated by subcellular fractionation) and culture media derived from HO-1-transfected astrocytes, as evidenced by enhanced oxidation of the synthetic reporter molecules, linoleoyl tyrosine (LT), linoleoyl tyrosine cholesterol ester (LTC), or linoleoyl tyrosine deoxyguanosyl ester (LTG; measured by GC/MS and LC/MS/MS). We also observed enhanced oxidation of exogenous LTC in human neuroblastoma (M17) cells exposed for 18 h to conditioned media collected from HO-1-transfected astrocytes relative to control media. In AD and other pathological states, glial HO-I induction may transduce ambient noxious stimuli (e.g., beta-amyloid) into altered patterns of glial sterol metabolism which, in turn, may affect neuronal membrane turnover, survival, and adaptability.

Why this occurs is not known. It is known, however, that withdrawal from chronic antipsychotic treatment induces behavioral dopaminergic supersensitivity in animals. How this emerging supersensitivity might interact with ongoing treatment has never been assessed. Therefore, we asked whether dopamine supersensitivity could overcome the behavioral and neurochemical effects of antipsychotics while they are still in use. Using two models of antipsychotic-like effects in rats, we show that during ongoing treatment with clinically relevant doses, haloperidol and olanzapine progressively lose their efficacy in suppressing amphetamine-induced locomotion and conditioned avoidance responding. Treatment failure occurred despite high levels of dopamine D-2 receptor occupancy by the antipsychotic and was at least temporarily reversible by an additional increase in antipsychotic dose. To explore potential mechanisms, we studied presynaptic and postsynaptic elements of the dopamine system and observed that antipsychotic failure was accompanied by opposing changes across the synapse: tolerance to the ability of haloperidol to increase basal dopamine and dopamine turnover on one side, and 20 - 40% increases in D-2 receptor number and 100 - 160% increases in the proportion of D-2 receptors in the high-affinity state for dopamine (D-2 (High)) on the other. Thus, the loss of antipsychotic efficacy is linked to an increase in D-2 receptor number and sensitivity. These results are the first to demonstrate that "breakthrough" supersensitivity during ongoing antipsychotic treatment undermines treatment efficacy. These findings provide a model and a mechanism for antipsychotic treatment failure and suggest new directions for the development of more effective antipsychotics.

However, most research in the field was done using tasks that varied the need for control on a trial-by-trial basis (e.g., Stroop, flanker) in a discrete manner. In this case, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was found to monitor the need for control, whereas regions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were found to be involved in control implementation. Whether or not the same control mechanism would be used in continuous tasks was an open question. In our study, we found that in a continuous task, the same neural substrate subserves control monitoring (ACC) but that the neural substrate of control implementation changes over time. Early in the task, regions in the PFC were involved in control implementation, whereas later the control was taken over by subcortical structures, specifically the caudate. Our results suggest that humans possess a flexible control mechanism, with a specific structure dedicated to monitoring the need for control and with multiple structures involved in control implementation.

Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) is implicated to phosphorylate tau in normal and AD brain. Previously, we isolated a large multiprotein complex containing tau, Ser(9)-phosphorylated GSK3 beta and 14-3-3 zeta from bovine brain microtubules. We showed that within the complex, 14-3-3 zeta binds to tau and GSK3 beta and mediates GSK3 beta-catalyzed tau phosphorylation. A recent report however indicated that 14-3-3 zeta does not bind to tau or GSK3 beta and does not increase tau phosphorylation by GSK3 beta in cell models [T.A. Matthews, G.V.W. Johnson, Neurosci. Lett. 384 (2005) 211-216]. In the current study we have thoroughly analyzed the binding of 14-3-3 zeta with tau and GSK3 beta and evaluated the effect of 14-3-3 beta on tau phosphorylation by GSK3 beta in HEK-293 cells. We found that 14-3-3 zeta binds to tau and Serophosphorylated GSK3 beta. Nonphosphorylated GSK3 beta phosphorylates tau without being influenced by 14-3-3 zeta. Ser(9)-phosphorylated GSK3 beta on the other hand phosphorylates tau significantly only in the presence of 14-3-3 zeta. Our data demonstrate that 14-3-3C mediates tau phosphorylation by Ser(9)-phosphorylated GSK3 beta in HEK-293 cells. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Olfactory sensory neurons in the sea lamprey display polymorphisms	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						olfactory sensory neurons; sea lamprey; olfactory epithelium	PETROMYZON-MARINUS L; RECEPTOR NEURONS; CRUCIAN CARP; CRYPT CELLS; EPITHELIUM; ZEBRAFISH; CATFISH; FISHES; SYSTEM	The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is an ancient jawless fish phyletically removed from modern (teleost) fishes. It is an excellent organism in the study of olfaction due to its accessible olfactory pathway, which is susceptible to manipulation, and its important location in the evolution of vertebrates. There are many similarities in the olfactory systems of all fishes, and they also share characteristics with the olfactory system of mammals. Teleost fishes lack the distinctive vomeronasal organ of mammals; rather all odours are processed initially by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of three morphotypes within the olfactory epithelium. We sought to identify olfactory sensory neuron polymorphisms in the sea lamprey. Using retrograde tracing with dyes injected into the olfactory bulb, we identified three morphotypes which are highly similar to those found in teleosts. This study provides the first evidence of morphotypes in the sea lamprey peripheral olfactory organ, and indicates that olfactory sensory neuron polymorphism may be a trait highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution.

We identified the occipital sulci and marked their corresponding gray matter voxels on the magnetic resonance images, which had been transformed into the Montreal Neurological Institute standard proportional stereotaxic space in order to construct probability maps. In the medial occipital region, the calcarine sulcus was the longest and most constant sulcus. We identified, in the inferior part of the medial occipital lobe, the lingual sulcus and the posterior collateral sulcus, and, in the Superior part, the inferior and superior sagittal sulci of the cuneus. On the lateral surface of the occipital lobe, the lateral occipital, the lunate, and the transverse and inferior occipital sulci were identified. The parieto-occipital fissure and the temporo-occipital incisure were also identified on the lateral and medial surfaces. Finally, the patterns of the occipital sulci and. gyri were examined in 20 post-mortem human hemispheres fixed in formalin. Probability maps of the occipital sulci were constructed, which provide a quantitative description of the variability of the sulci in standard stereotaxic space and may be used to identify the location of voxels in other magnetic resonance images transformed into the same streotaxic space. These maps are a useful tool in the study of functional activations rela Led to visual processing.

Forebrain neurons are likely to modulate MLR activity, but little is known about their inputs. Descending GABAergic projections to the MLR were identified by double-labeling neurons using Neurobiotin injected into the MLR combined with immunofluorescence against GABA. Several GABAergic projections to the MLR were identified in the telencephalon and diencephalon. The most abundant GABAergic projection to the MLR came from the caudal portion of the medial pallium, a region that may have similarities with the amygdala of higher vertebrates. A small population of GABAergic cells projecting to the MLR was found in the striatum and the ventral portion of the lateral pallium, which could respectively correspond to the input and output components of the basal ganglia thought to be involved in the selection of motor programs. Other GABAergic projections were found to come from the thalamus and the hypothalamus, which could take part in the motivational aspect of motor behavior in lampreys. Electrophysiological experiments were also carried out to examine the effects of GABA agonists and antagonists injected into the MLR in a semi-intact lamprey preparation. The GABA agonist inhibited locomotion, whereas the GABA antagonist initiated it. These results suggest that the GABAergic projections to the MLR modulate the activity of MLR neurons, which would be inhibited by GABA at rest.

Reservoir storage loss due to grounded ice during winter operation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						ice cover; artificial neural networks; lake; growth; storage	NETWORKS	The immobilization of water in the form of deposited ice on the reservoir's embankments during winter operations has received little attention in hydrological literature. In Nordic countries like Canada, this phenomenon is likely to have significant negative impacts on reservoir operation. In a previous work (Seidou, O., Ouarda, T.B.M.J., Bilodeau, L., Hessami, M., St-Hilaire, A., Bruneau, P., 2006. Modeling ice growth on Canadian takes using artificial neural metworks. Water Resources Research 42. doi: doi:10.1029/2005WR004622); the authors developed a global artificial neural network model to predict ice thickness growth in unmonitored Canadian takes and reservoirs. This model is used in this paper to compute a time series of ice thickness on the Gouin reservoir (Saint-Maurice River, Quebec, Canada) and the Outardes 4 reservoir (Aux Outardes River, Quebec, Canada). This and the relationship between surface water area and water level were then used to evaluate the volume of ice left on the banks of the two reservoirs during winter operation, as its water level is progressively Lowered in order to release water for hydroelectric production at downstream power dams. Results show that the ratio of frozen water left on the banks to the active storage varies from 2% to 8% at the Gouin reservoir, and from 0.41% to 1.15% at the Outardes 4 reservoir depending on the water usage policy and the geometry of the reservoir.

Early blind individuals showed a significantly smaller right posterior hippocampus compared with controls. No differences in total hippocampal volumes were found between groups and there were no within-group differences for left versus right hippocampus. Sex, age and total brain grey matter volume had no effect on hippocampal volumes. Although extensive navigational training results in structural enhancement of the hippocampus for the sighted, the reduction of the posterior hippocampus in early blind individuals suggests the implication of this region in visual spatial memory.

In this study, the neural correlates of bird expertise were investigated by using electroencephalography to measure auditory-evoked potentials in bird experts and novices. Auditory stimuli in three categories (birdsongs, environmental sounds and voices) were presented in a pseudo-random order while participants performed a simple target detection task (pure tone). We observed similar amplitudes and distributions of the N100-comporent in bird experts and novices. In contrast, the amplitude of the P200 component was significantly smaller in bird experts at the Pz and Cz electrodes, reflecting a more frontal topography of this positivity. Notably, this group difference was observed not only for birdsongs, but also for voices and environmental sounds, suggesting a general processing difference in bird experts, not restricted to the category of expertise.

Phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 1 by cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 during nerve growth factor-induced PC12 cell differentiation	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							EARLY GENE ZIF268; GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3-BETA; BOVINE BRAIN; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; CATALYTIC SUBUNIT; KINASE KINASE; INDUCTION; CDK5; P35; EXPRESSION	The transcription factor Egr-1 activates cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5) during nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of PC12 cells into neurons (Harada, T. Morooka, T., Ogawa, S., and Nishida, E. (2001) Nat. Cell Biol. 3, 453-459). The downstream target of Cdk5 in the Egr-1/Cdk5 pathway is not clear. In this study, we observed that phosphorylation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) on Thr(320) is reduced in brain extracts from Egr-1(-/-) mice, indicating that a kinase downstream of Egr-1 phosphorylates PP1. In HEK 293 cells co-transfected with PP1. and Cdk5, Cdk5 phosphorylates PP1. In vitro, Cdk5 purified from bovine brain phosphorylates bacterially expressed recombinant PP1. In NGF-treated PC12 cells, inhibition of Cdk5 by olomoucine or silencing Cdk5 expression by small interfering RNA strategy, suppresses PP1 phosphorylation. Silencing Cdk5 expression by small interfering RNA also blocks NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Overexpression of PP1 (wild type) promotes NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells, whereas that of PP1 (T320A) has no effect. Our data indicate that PP1 is a downstream target of the NGF/Egr-1/Cdk5 pathway during NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells and suggest that PP1 phosphorylation promotes neuronal differentiation.

Some selection is however necessary to limit trials to more promising and less risky endeavors. Experimental models are the privileged answer to the problem of finding scientific evidence while refraining from harming patients in the course of this pursuit. They allow a step by step assessment, from simple but artificial settings to more complex and realistic animal models. But the use of animal models can only be justified if the community can be convinced that alternatives have been considered but are invalid, when the project is scientifically sound and methodologically irreproachable. As neurointerventional methods develop and gain wider clinical applications, progress should proceed in an orderly fashion, within limits set by prudence and human values, from the less risky, costly, time consuming methods, to the more definite, pragmatic, labor intensive but inescapable clinical trials. Each step is essential and the sequence cannot be violated without risks of errors that eventually translate into clinical morbidity.

Inter- and intraobserver variability in the assessment of brain arteriovenous malformation angioarchitecture and endovascular treatment results	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							OBSERVER AGREEMENT; GRADING SYSTEM; ANEURYSMS; MANAGEMENT; HEMORRHAGE	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several angiographic features of brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) have been associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage. However, interpretation of these features may not be consistent between observers. We conducted a study to determine inter- and intraobserver agreement of various angioarchitectural characteristics of BAVM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two experienced interventional neuroradiologists independently reviewed pre- and post-endovascular treatment angiograms from 50 consecutive patients. Axial CT and/or MR images before treatment were included. We collected the following data: Spetzler-Martin grades, number of involved arterial territories, associated aneurysms by location (circle of Willis, feeding artery, intranidal, and venous), and nidus reduction after endovascular treatment (< 33%, 33%-66%, and > 66%). The reviewers were compared with each other, and 1 was compared with himself after a 3-month interval. Measures of agreement were performed by using the kappa statistic (K) for nominal data and the weighted K for ordinal data. RESULTS: Inter- and intraobserver agreement were higher for assessment of the Spetzler-Martin grade (weighted K = 0.70/0.75) and nidus size reduction after endovascular treatment (K = 0.74/0.77). Inter- and intraobserver agreement were inferior for findings concerning feeding artery aneurysms (K 0.19/0.36), intraniclal aneurysms (K = 0.34/0.35), and venous aneurysms (K = 0.50/0.67). CONCLUSION: Angiographic characteristics of BAVMs considered as risk factors for hemorrhage, such as aneurysms, are not reliably detected on global angiograms between different observers. In contrast, the Spetzler-Martin grading system and angiographic results of endovascular treatment can be used with high observer agreement.

During oxidant stress, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) concentrations increase. We explored whether LPA caused cytotoxicity to neuromicrovascular cells and the potential mechanisms thereof. LPA caused a dose-dependent death of porcine cerebral microvascular as well as human umbilical vein endothelial cells; cell death appeared oncotic rather than apoptotic. LPA-induced cell death was mediated via LPA(1) receptor, because the specific LPA(1) receptor antagonist THG1603 fully abrogated LPA's effects. LPA decreased intracellular GSH levels and induced a p38 MAPK/JNK-dependent inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression. Pretreatment with the antioxidant GSH precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as well as with inhibitors of NOS [N-omega-nitro-Larginine (L-NNA); 1400W], significantly prevented LPA-induced endothelial cell death ( in vitro) to comparable extents; as expected, p38 MAPK (SB203580) and JNK (SP-600125) inhibitors also diminished cell death. LPA did not increase indexes of oxidation (isoprostanes, hydroperoxides, and protein nitration) but did augment protein nitrosylation. Endothelial cytotoxicity by LPA in vitro was reproduced ex vivo in brain and in vivo in retina; THG1603, NAC, L-NNA, and combined SB-203580 and SP600125 prevented the microvascular rarefaction. Data implicate novel properties for LPA as a modulator of the cell redox environment, which partakes in endothelial cell death and ensued neuromicrovascular rarefaction.

Multivariate calibrations use the entire signal matrix for all elements in a single multivariate regression model. This enables accounting for the correlation between variables often referred to as matrix effects in conventional univariate modeling. Modeling the entire signal matrix improves robustness over traditional univariate calibration since it can compensate for matrix effects. Several nonlinear data pretreatment methods have been used to correct for nonlinear behaviors of the analytical signals prior to performing the multivariate calibration. The use of multivariate calibration in combination with cubic implicit nonlinear data pretreatment showed the most accurate results. The accuracy reported with the developed multivariate calibration is better than 5% for the major alloying elements. Based on the results obtained, the use of chemometrics and laser-induced plasma spectroscopy have been successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of major and minor alloying elements in aluminum.

We have shown that GPC3 was expressed in neuroblastoma and Wilms' tumor. To understand the mechanisms regulating the transcription of this gene in neuroblastoma cells, we have focused our study on the identification of putative transcription factors binding the promoter. In this report we performed in vivo dimethyl sulfate, UV type C irradiation and DNasel footprinting analyses coupled with ligation-mediated PCR on nearly 1000 bp of promoter in two neuroblastoma cell lines, SJNB-7 (expressing GPC3) and SK-N-FI (not expressing GPC3). Nucleosome signature footprints were observed in the most distal part of the studied region in both cell lines. We detected eight large differentially protected regions, suggesting the presence of binding proteins in both cell lines but more DNA-protein interactions in GPC3-expressing cells. Sp1 was previously shown to be able to bind some of these regions. Here by combining electromobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitations we showed that the transcription factor NFY was part of the DNA-protein complex found in footprinted regions upstream of the described minimal promoter. These studies per-formed on chromatin in situ suggest that NFY and yet unknown cell type-specific factors may play an important role in the regulation of GPC3. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy	The spectrum of SCNIA-related infantile epileptic encephalopathies	BRAIN			English	Article						SCNIA; SMEI; SMEB; epileptic encephalopathy; channelopathies	SEVERE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; FEBRILE SEIZURES PLUS; LENNOX-GASTAUT SYNDROME; INDEPENDENT SPIKE FOCI; TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES; DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; CHANNEL ALPHA-1-SUBUNIT MUTATIONS; IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; NEURONAL SODIUM-CHANNEL; GRAND-MAL SEIZURES	The relationship between severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI or Dravet syndrome) and the related syndrome SMEI-borderland (SMEB) with mutations in the sodium channel alpha 1 subunit gene SCN1A is well established. To explore the phenotypic variability associated with SCN1A mutations, 188 patients with a range of epileptic encephalopathies were examined for SCN1A sequence variations by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequencing. All patients had seizure onset within the first 2 years of life. A higher proportion of mutations were identified in patients with SMEI (52/66; 79%) compared to patients with SMEB (25/36; 69%). By studying a broader spectrum of infantile epileptic encephalopathies, we identified mutations in other syndromes including cryptogenic generalized epilepsy (24%) and cryptogenic focal epilepsy (22%). Within the latter group, a distinctive subgroup designated as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy had SCN1A mutations in three of five cases. This phenotype is characterized by early onset multifocal seizures and later cognitive decline. Knowledge of an expanded spectrum of epileptic encephalopathies associated with SCN1A mutations allows earlier diagnostic confirmation for children with these devastating disorders.

The antinociceptive effects of intraplantar injections of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol are mediated by cannabinoid CB2 receptors	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						2-arachidonoyl glycerol; URB602; endocannabinoids; cannabinoid receptors; monoacylglycerol lipase; formalin test; inflammatory pain	FOS PROTEIN EXPRESSION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; FORMALIN TEST; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; SELECTIVE ACTIVATION; MONOGLYCERIDE LIPASE; SAPHENOUS NERVE; DORSAL-HORN; SPINAL-CORD	Background and purpose: 2- arachidonoyl glycerol ( 2- AG) is an endogenous cannabinoid with central antinociceptive properties. Its degradation is catalysed by monoacylglycerol lipase ( MGL) whose activity is inhibited by URB602, a new synthetic compound. The peripheral antinociceptive effects of 2- AG and URB602 in an inflammatory model of pain are not yet determined. We have evaluated these effects with and without the cannabinoid CB1 ( AM251) and CB2 ( AM630) receptor antagonists. Experimental approach: Inflammation was induced in rat hind paws by intraplantar injection of formalin. Nociception was assessed behaviourally over the next 60 min, in 19 experimental groups: ( 1) control; ( 2- 6) 2- AG ( 0.01- 100 mu g); ( 7) AM251 ( 80 mg); ( 8) AM251 + 2- AG ( 10 mg); ( 9) AM630 ( 25 mg); ( 10) AM630 + 2- AG ( 10 mg); ( 11-16) URB602 ( 0.1-500 mg); ( 17) 2- AG + URB602 ( ED50); ( 18) AM251 + URB602 ( ED50); ( 19) AM630 + URB602 ( ED50). Drugs were injected s. c. in the dorsal surface of the hind paw ( 50 mu l), 15 min before formalin injection into the same paw. Key results: 2- AG and URB602 produced dose-dependent antinociceptive effects for the late phases of the formalin test with ED50 of 0.65 +/- 0.455 mg and 68 +/- 14.3 mg, respectively. Their combination at ED50 doses produced an additive antinociceptive effect. These effects were inhibited by AM630 but not by AM251 for 2- AG and by the two cannabinoid antagonists for URB602. Conclusions and implications: Locally injected 2- AG and URB602 decreased pain behaviour in a dose-dependent manner in an inflammatory model of pain. The antinociceptive effect of 2- AG was mediated by the CB2 receptor.

Phosphorylation of sodium channels mediated by protein kinase-C modulates inhibition by topiramate of tetrodotoxin-sensitive transient sodium current	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						transient Na+ current; topiramate; PKC; sodium channel; antiepileptic drug	CULTURED HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; PERSISTENT NA+ CURRENT; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; GRANULE CELLS; RAT; ACTIVATION; INCREASES; EPILEPSY; EXCITABILITY	Background and purpose: Topiramate is a novel anticonvulsant known to modulate the activity of several ligand- and voltage- gated ion channels in neurons. The mechanism of action of topiramate, at a molecular level, is still unclear, but the phosphorylation state of the channel/ receptor seems to be a factor that is able to influence its activity. We investigated the consequences of phosphorylation of the sodium channel on the effect of topiramate on tetrodotoxin ( TTX)-sensitive transient Na+ current ( I-NaT). Experimental approach: I-NaT was recorded in dissociated neurons of rat sensorimotor cortex using whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. Key results: We found that topiramate (100 mu M) significantly shifted the steady- state I-NaT inactivation curve in a hyperpolarized direction. In neurons pre- treated with a PKC- activator, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol ( OAG; 2 mM), the net effect of topiramate on steady- state I-NaT inactivation was significantly decreased. In addition, OAG also slightly shifted the I-NaT activation curve in a hyperpolarized direction, while perfusion with topiramate had no effect on the parameters of I-NaT activation. Conclusions and Implications: These data show that PKC- activation can modulate the effect of topiramate on I-NaT. This suggests that channel phosphorylation in physiological or pathological conditions ( such as epiliepsy), can alter the action of topiramate on sodium currents.
