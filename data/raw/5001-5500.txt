Yet, the neural correlates associated with such learning strategies in motor sequence learning remain largely unexplored to date. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the cerebral activity of individuals executing the same 8-element sequence after they completed a 4-days training regimen (2 sessions each day) following either a global or incremental strategy. A network comprised of striatal and fronto-parietal regions was engaged significantly regardless of the learning strategy, whereas the global training regimen led to additional cerebellar and temporal lobe recruitment. Analysis of chunking/grouping of sequence elements revealed a common prefrontal network in both conditions during the chunk initiation phase, whereas execution of chunk cores led to higher mediotemporal activity (involving the hippocampus) after global than incremental training. The novelty of our results relate to the recruitment of mediotemporal regions conditional of the learning strategy. Thus, the present findings may have clinical implications suggesting that the ability of patients with lesions to the medial temporal lobe to learn and consolidate new motor sequences may benefit from using an incremental strategy.

Somatic Mutations in Cerebral Cortical Malformations	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							SEVERE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; EXOME; MOSAICISM; DISEASE; DYNC1H1; TUBB2B; AKT3	BACKGROUND Although there is increasing recognition of the role of somatic mutations in genetic disorders, the prevalence of somatic mutations in neurodevelopmental disease and the optimal techniques to detect somatic mosaicism have not been systematically evaluated. METHODS Using a customized panel of known and candidate genes associated with brain malformations, we applied targeted high-coverage sequencing (depth, = 200x) to leukocyte-derived DNA samples from 158 persons with brain malformations, including the double-cortex syndrome (subcortical band heterotopia, 30 persons), polymicrogyria with megalencephaly (20), periventricular nodular heterotopia (61), and pachygyria (47). We validated candidate mutations with the use of Sanger sequencing and, for variants present at unequal read depths, subcloning followed by colony sequencing. RESULTS Validated, causal mutations were found in 27 persons (17%; range, 10 to 30% for each phenotype). Mutations were somatic in 8 of the 27 (30%), predominantly in persons with the double-cortex syndrome (in whom we found mutations in DCX and LIS1), persons with periventricular nodular heterotopia (FLNA), and persons with pachygyria (TUBB2B). Of the somatic mutations we detected, 5 (63%) were undetectable with the use of traditional Sanger sequencing but were validated through subcloning and subsequent sequencing of the subcloned DNA. We found potentially causal mutations in the candidate genes DYNC1H1, KIF5C, and other kinesin genes in persons with pachygyria. CONCLUSIONS Targeted sequencing was found to be useful for detecting somatic mutations in patients with brain malformations. High-coverage sequencing panels provide an important complement to whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing in the evaluation of somatic mutations in neuropsychiatric disease.

Unique Interweaved Microtubule Scaffold Mediates Osmosensory Transduction via Physical Interaction with TRPV1	NEURON			English	Article							LAMINA TERMINALIS NEURONS; RAT SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEUS; TOUCH RECEPTOR NEURONS; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; PROXIMITY LIGATION; TUBULIN; CHANNELS; MECHANOTRANSDUCTION; ORGANIZATION; CYTOSKELETON	The electrical activity of mammalian osmosensory neurons (ONs) is increased by plasma hypertonicity to command thirst, antidiuretic hormone release, and increased sympathetic tone during dehydration. Osmosensory transduction is a mechanical process whereby decreases in cell volume cause the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channels to induce depolarization and increase spiking activity in ONs. However, it is not known how cell shrinking is mechanically coupled to channel activation. Using superresolution imaging, we found that ONs are endowed with a uniquely interweaved scaffold of microtubules throughout their somata. Microtubules physically interact with the C terminus of TRPV1 at the cell surface and provide a pushing force that drives channels activation during shrinking. Moreover, we found that changes in the density of these interactions can bidirectionally modulate osmosensory gain. Microtubules are thus an essential component of the vital neuronal mechanotransduction apparatus that allows the brain to monitor and correct body hydration.

In mice, homozygosity for mutations in the Vangl1 and Vangl2 genes or combined heterozygosity for Vangl1/Vangl2 mutations causes the very severe neural tube defect (NTD) craniorachischisis. Recently, a number of patient-specific VANGL1 and VANGL2 protein mutations have been identified in familial and sporadic cases of mild and severe forms of NTDs. The biochemical nature of pathological effects in these mutations remains unknown. Of interest are two arginine residues, R181 and R274, that are highly conserved in Vangl protein homologues and found to be independently mutated in VANGL1 (R181Q and R274Q) and VANGL2 (R177H and R270H) in human cases of NTDs. The cellular and biochemical properties of R181Q and R274Q were established in transfected MDCK kidney epithelial cells and compared to those of wild-type (WT) Vangl1. Compared to that of WT, these mutations displayed impaired targeting to the plasma membrane and were instead detected in an intracellular endomembrane compartment that was positive for the endoplasmic reticulum. R181Q and R274Q showed impaired stability with significant reductions in measured half-lives from >20 h for WT protein to 9 and 5 h, respectively. These mutations have a cellular and biochemical phenotype that is indistinguishable from that of Vangl mutations known to cause craniorachichisis in mice (Lp). These results strongly suggest that R181 and R274 play critical roles in Vangl protein function and that their mutations cause neural tube defects in humans.

However, the temporality of the association is undetermined. One hypothesis is that hippocampal atrophy might be a susceptibility factor for depression. In the present study, we assessed whether hippocampal atrophy was associated with subsequent depressive symptoms in a cohort of older French adults (n=1,309) whowere 65-80 years of age and enrolled into the study in 1999-2001 in Dijon, France. Subjects were followed for more than 10 years. Participants underwent 2 cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scans, one at baseline and one at the 4-year follow-up. We used linear mixed models to estimate the associations of hippocampal atrophy with 1) the average depressive symptom scores over follow-up (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale) measured biennially over the subsequent 6 years and 2) changes in symptom scores over follow-up. In women, a 2-standard-deviation increase in annual hippocampal atrophy was associated with a 1.67-point (95% confidence interval: 0.59, 2.77) increase in the average depressive symptom score over follow-up and with a 1.97-point (95% confidence interval: 0.68, 3.24) increase in scores over the 2 subsequent years but not with later changes in symptoms. No association was detected in men. Accounting for potential selective attrition (using inverse probability weights) did not alter results. Hippocampal atrophy was associated with more subsequent depressive symptoms and with shorter-term worsening of symptoms in women.

Once memories are consolidated, they are not necessarily fixed but can be changed long after storage. In particular, seemingly stable memories may re-enter an unstable state when they are retrieved, from which they must be re-stabilized during a process known as reconsolidation. During reconsolidation, memories are susceptible to modifications again, thus providing an opportunity to update seemingly stable memories. While initial demonstrations of memory reconsolidation came mainly from animal studies, evidence for reconsolidation in humans is now accumulating as well. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of human memory reconsolidation. After a summary of findings on the reconsolidation of human fear and episodic memory, we focus particularly on recent neuroimaging data that provide first insights into how reconsolidation processes are implemented in the human brain. Finally, we discuss the implications of memory modifications during reconsolidation for the treatment of mental disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and drug addiction.

While the latest techniques usually introduce computational complexity and/or vagueness, the conventional techniques attempted in literature have led to poor results. This study presents a spindle detection approach which relies on intuitive pre-processing of the EEG prior to spindle detection, thus resulting in higher accuracy even with standard techniques. New method: The pre-processing techniques proposed include applying the derivative operator on the EEG, suppressing the background activity using Empirical Mode Decomposition and shortlisting candidate EEG segments based on eye-movements on the EOG. Results/comparison: Results show that standard signal processing tools such as wavelets and Fourier transforms perform much better when coupled with apt pre-processing techniques. The developed algorithm also relies on data-driven thresholds ensuring its adaptability to inter-subject and inter-scorer variability. When tested on sample EEG segments scored by multiple experts, the algorithm identified spindles with average sensitivities of 96.14 and 92.85% and specificities of 87.59 and 84.85% for Fourier transform and wavelets respectively. These results are found to be on par with results obtained by other recent studies in this area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Animal models(1) can demonstrate the effects of neurotoxic substances; however, they provide limited insight into the psycho-social and higher cognitive factors involved in the initiation of substance use and progression to misuse. One can search for pre-existing risk factors by testing for endophenotypic biomarkers(2) in non-using relatives; however, these relatives may have personality or neural resilience factors that protect them from developing dependence(3). A longitudinal study has potential to identify predictors of adolescent substance misuse, particularly if it can incorporate a wide range of potential causal factors, both proximal and distal, and their influence on numerous social, psychological and biological mechanisms(4). Here we apply machine learning to a wide range of data from a large sample of adolescents (n = 692) to generate models of current and future adolescent alcohol misuse that incorporate brain structure and function, individual personality and cognitive differences, environmental factors (including gestational cigarette and alcohol exposure), life experiences, and candidate genes. These models were accurate and generalized to novel data, and point to life experiences, neurobiological differences and personality as important antecedents of binge drinking. By identifying the vulnerability factors underlying individual differences in alcohol misuse, these models shed light on the aetiology of alcohol misuse and suggest targets for prevention.

Among environmental factors, social experience plays an important role in modulating aggression in vertebrates and invertebrates. In Drosophila, pheromonal activation of olfactory neurons contributes to social suppression of aggression. While it was reported that impairment in vision decreases the level of aggression in Drosophila, it remains unknown if visual perception also contributes to the modulation of aggression by social experience. Results: In this study, we investigate the role of visual perception in the control of aggression in Drosophila. We took several genetic approaches to examine the effects of blocking visual circuit activity on fly aggressive behaviors. In wild type, group housing greatly suppresses aggressiveness. Loss of vision by mutating the ninaB gene does not affect social suppression of fly aggression. Similar suppression of aggressiveness by group housing is observed in fly mutants carrying a mutation in the eya gene leading to complete loss of eye. Chronic visual loss does not affect the level of aggressiveness of single-housed flies that lack social experience prior to behavioral tests. When visual circuit activity is acutely blocked during behavioral test, however, single-housed flies display higher levels of aggressiveness than that of control flies. Conclusion: Visual perception does not play a major role in social suppression of aggression in Drosophila. For single-housed individuals lacking social experience prior to behavioral tests, visual perception decreases the level of aggressiveness.

Because it is impaired with aging, multitasking has often been targeted and has been shown to be malleable with appropriate training. Investigating the effects of cognitive training on functional brain activation might provide critical indication regarding the mechanisms that underlie those positive effects, as well as provide models for selecting appropriate training methods. The few studies that have looked at brain correlates of cognitive training indicate a variable pattern and location of brain changes - a result that might relate to differences in training formats. The goal of this study was to measure the neural substrates as a function of whether divided attentional training programs induced the use of alternative processes or whether it relied on repeated practice. Forty-eight older adults were randomly allocated to one of three training programs. In the SINGLE REPEATED training, participants practiced an alphanumeric equation and a visual detection task, each under focused attention. In the DIVIDED FIXED training, participants practiced combining verification and detection by divided attention, with equal attention allocated to both tasks. In the DIVIDED VARIABLE training, participants completed the task by divided attention, but were taught to vary the attentional priority allocated to each task. Brain activation was measured with fMRI pre- and post-training while completing each task individually and the two tasks combined. The three training programs resulted in markedly different brain changes. Practice on individual tasks in the SINGLE REPEATED training resulted in reduced brain activation whereas DIVIDED VARIABLE training resulted in a larger recruitment of the right superior and middle frontal gyrus, a region that has been involved in multitasking. The type of training is a critical factor in determining the pattern of brain activation.

In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, cutaneous electrical stimulation was applied to human volunteers at three intensities (low-innocuous, moderate-noxious and high-noxious) to investigate interactions between contralateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (Sic and S2c), and between contralateral and ipsilateral S2 (S2c and S2i), using dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Our results are consistent with serial processing with a key role of the direct input to Sic for all three intensity levels. The more intense stimulus also induced significantly more interactions between S2i and S2c, consistent with an increase in inter-hemispheric integration associated with the additional recruitment of nociceptive inputs. However, stronger pain reports were also associated with reduced information flow from Sic to S2c at both the moderate (r = -0.81, p = 0.004) and the high stimulation level (r = -0.63, p = 0.037). These findings suggest that the connectivity pattern driven by innocuous inputs is modified by the additional activation of nociceptive afferents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Circadian disruption is known to increase the incidence of various illnesses, such as mental disorders, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. At the molecular level, periodicity is established by a set of clock genes via autoregulatory translation transcription feedback loops. This clock mechanism is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which set the pace of the clock. Ubiquitination in particular has been found to regulate the stability of core clock components but also other clock protein functions. Mutation of genes encoding ubiquitin ligases can cause either elongation or shortening of the endogenous circadian period. Recent research has also started to uncover roles for deubiquitination in the molecular clockwork. Here, we review the role of the ubiquitin pathway in regulating the circadian clock and we propose that ubiquitination is a key element in a clock protein modification code that orchestrates clock mechanisms and circadian behavior over the daily cycle.

CC2D1A Regulates Human Intellectual and Social Function as well as NF-kappa B Signaling Homeostasis	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							NONSYNDROMIC MENTAL-RETARDATION; C2 DOMAIN PROTEIN; NOTCH; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; TRAFFICKING; PLASTICITY; DROSOPHILA; DISORDERS; RECEPTORS	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are often comorbid, but the extent to which they share common genetic causes remains controversial. Here, we present two autosomal-recessive "founder" mutations in the CC2D1A gene causing fully penetrant cognitive phenotypes, including mild-to-severe ID, ASD, as well as seizures, suggesting shared developmental mechanisms. CC2D1A regulates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, and we found its strongest effect to be on the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Cc2d1a gain and loss of function both increase activation of NF-kappa B, revealing a critical role of Cc2d1a in homeostatic control of intracellular signaling. Cc2d1a knockdown in neurons reduces dendritic complexity and increases NF-kappa B activity, and the effects of Cc2d1a depletion can be rescued by inhibiting NF-kappa B activity. Homeostatic regulation of neuronal signaling pathways provides a mechanism whereby common founder mutations could manifest diverse symptoms in different patients.	[Manzini, M.

More recently, CDC was reported in seven children without neuromuscular involvement (Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome). Using a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified biallelic mutations in LAM41 as the cause of CDC in seven affected individuals (from five families) independent from those included in the phenotypic description of Poretti-Boltshauser syndrome. Most of these individuals also have high myopia, and some have retinal dystrophy and patchy increased T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2/FLAIR) signal in cortical white matter. In one additional family, we identified two siblings who have truncating LAMA1 mutations in combination with retinal dystrophy and mild cerebellar dysplasia without cysts, indicating that cysts are not an obligate feature associated with loss of LAMA1 function. This work expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with the lamininopathy disorders and highlights the tissue-specific roles played by different laminin-encoding genes.

Hydrogen Peroxide Increases GABA(A) Receptor-Mediated Tonic Current in Hippocampal Neurons	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						GABA(A) receptor; hippocampus; hydrogen peroxide; ischemia-reperfusion; mouse; tonic current	OXIDATIVE STRESS; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; ALPHA-5 SUBUNIT; CATION CHANNEL; GRANULE CELLS; DELTA-SUBUNIT; ION CHANNELS; ACTIVATION; MODULATION	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a key reactive oxygen species, is produced at low levels during normal cellular metabolism and at higher concentrations under pathological conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion injury. The mechanisms by which H2O2 contributes to physiological and pathological processes in the brain remain poorly understood. Inhibitory GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors critically regulate brain function by generating tonic and synaptic currents; however, it remains unknown whether H2O2 directly modulates GABA(A) receptor function. Here, we performed patch-clamp recordings, together with pharmacological and genetic approaches, to investigate the effects of H2O2 on GABA(A) receptor-mediated tonic and synaptic currents recorded in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons and CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. We found that H2O2 caused a dramatic increase in tonic current, whereas synaptic currents were unaffected. This increase in tonic current resulted from an extracellular oxidative reaction, which increased the potency of GABA, but only when GABA(A) receptors were activated by low concentrations of GABA. Oxygen-glucose deprivation, which produces high endogenous levels of H2O2, similarly increased the tonic current. These results suggest that GABA(A) receptor-mediated tonic current, which is potentiated by H2O2, might contribute to H2O2-induced brain dysfunction.

Synapses are enveloped with intricate processes of astrocytes known as perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs). PAPs are motile structures displaying rapid actin-dependent movements and are characterized by Ca2+ elevations in response to neuronal activity. Despite a debated implication in synaptic plasticity, the role of both Ca2+ events in astrocytes and PAP morphological dynamics remain unclear. Results: In the hippocampus, we found that PAPs show extensive structural plasticity that is regulated by synaptic activity through astrocytic metabotropic glutamate receptors and intracellular calcium signaling. Synaptic activation that induces long-term potentiation caused a transient PAP motility increase leading to an enhanced astrocytic coverage of the synapse. Selective activation of calcium signals in individual PAPs using exogenous metabotropic receptor expression and two-photon uncaging reproduced these effects and enhanced spine stability. In vivo imaging in the somatosensory cortex of adult mice revealed that increased neuronal activity through whisker stimulation similarly elevates PAP movement. This in vivo PAP motility correlated with spine coverage and was predictive of spine stability. Conclusions: This study identifies a novel bidirectional interaction between synapses and astrocytes, in which synaptic activity and synaptic potentiation regulate PAP structural plasticity, which in turn determines the fate of the synapse. This mechanism may represent an important contribution of astrocytes to learning and memory processes.

In the social sciences and in psychology, numerous CPGs have been developed, yet research has failed to investigate their quality and methodology. This pilot study evaluated the 5 available guidelines of the Order of Psychologists of Quebec (OPQ) using a scoring system proposed by Ansari and Rashidian (2012) for examining guideline development tasks. The method consisted of rating CPGs based on the absence, presence, or detailed consideration of 27 tasks involved in guideline development. Overall, results suggest that the CPGs did not implement important tasks for guideline development, and were far below the acceptable standards in guideline development procedures. A minimal number of the necessary tasks for guideline development were addressed in the CPGs. These findings suggest there are important problems with the development and quality of these CPGs. The pilot study also points to the need for conducting future research on the clinical guidelines used in psychology.

The Contribution of Adolescent Effortful Control to Early Adult Educational Attainment	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						educational attainment level; self-regulation; academic achievement; adolescence; family background	FAMILY-CENTERED INTERVENTION; SELF-REGULATION; SUBSTANCE USE; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; HIGH-SCHOOL; DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES; EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS; KINDERGARTEN-CHILDREN; PARENTS EDUCATION; ADAPTIVE APPROACH	Effortful control has been proposed as a set of neurocognitive competencies that is relevant to self-regulation and educational attainment (Posner & Rothbart, 2007). This study tested the hypothesis that a multiagent report of adolescents' effortful control (age 17) would be predictive of academic persistence and educational attainment (age 23-25), after controlling for other established predictors (family factors, problem behavior, grade-point average, and substance use). Participants were 997 students recruited in 6th grade from 3 urban public middle schools (53% males; 42.4% European American; 29.2% African American). Consistent with the hypothesis, the unique association of effortful control with future educational attainment was comparable in strength to that of parental education and students' past grade-point average, suggesting that effortful control contributes to this outcome above and beyond well-established predictors. Path coefficients were equivalent across gender and ethnicity (European Americans and African Americans). Effortful control appears to be a core feature of the self-regulatory competencies associated with achievement of educational success in early adulthood. These findings suggest that the promotion of self-regulation in general and effortful control in particular may be an important focus not only for resilience to stress and avoidance of problem behavior but also for growth in academic competence.

J	Mendez, A; Belghith, A; Sawan, M				Mendez, Arnaldo; Belghith, Abrar; Sawan, Mohamad			A DSP for Sensing the Bladder Volume Through Afferent Neural Pathways	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Biomedical signal processing; biomedical transducers; bladder volume; neural prosthesis; spike sorting	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SPIKE-DETECTION; DATA-COMPRESSION; SYSTEM; ALGORITHMS; AMPLIFIER	In this paper, we present a digital signal processor (DSP) capable of monitoring the urinary bladder volume through afferent neural pathways. The DSP carries out real-time detection and can discriminate extracellular action potentials, also known as on-the-fly spike sorting. Next, the DSP performs a decoding method to estimate either three qualitative levels of fullness or the bladder volume value, depending on the selected output mode. The proposed DSP was tested using both realistic synthetic signals with a known ground-truth, and real signals from bladder afferent nerves recorded during acute experiments with animal models. The spike sorting processing circuit yielded an average accuracy of 92% using signals with highly correlated spike waveforms and low signal-to-noise ratios. The volume estimation circuits, tested with real signals, reproduced accuracies achieved by offline simulations in Matlab, i.e., 94% and 97% for quantitative and qualitative estimations, respectively. To assess feasibility, the DSP was deployed in the Actel FPGA Igloo AGL1000V2, which showed a power consumption of 0.5 mW and a latency of 2.1 ms at a 333 kHz core frequency. These performance results demonstrate that an implantable bladder sensor that perform the detection, discrimination and decoding of afferent neural activity is feasible.

TNF plays an important role both in modulating synaptic function and in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Etanercept is a recombinant therapeutic that neutralizes pathologic levels of TNF. Brain imaging has demonstrated chronic intracerebral microglial activation and neuroinflammation following stroke and other forms of acute brain injury. Activated microglia release TNF, which mediates neurotoxicity in the stroke penumbra. Recent observational studies have reported rapid and sustained improvement in chronic post-stroke neurological and cognitive dysfunction following perispinal administration of etanercept. The biological plausibility of these results is supported by independent evidence demonstrating reduction in cognitive dysfunction, neuropathic pain, and microglial activation following the use of etanercept, as well as multiple studies reporting improvement in stroke outcome and cognitive impairment following therapeutic strategies designed to inhibit TNF. The causal association between etanercept treatment and reduction in post-stroke disability satisfy all of the Bradford Hill Criteria: strength of the association; consistency; specificity; temporality; biological gradient; biological plausibility; coherence; experimental evidence; and analogy. Recognition that chronic microglial activation and pathologic TNF concentration are targets that may be therapeutically addressed for years following stroke and other forms of acute brain injury provides an exciting new direction for research and treatment.

MORC1 exhibits cross-species differential methylation in association with early life stress as well as genome-wide association with MDD	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; DNA METHYLATION; EPIGENETIC REGULATION; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; BIPOLAR DISORDER; ALCOHOL EXPOSURE; GENE-EXPRESSION	Early life stress (ELS) is associated with increased vulnerability for diseases in later life, including psychiatric disorders. Animal models and human studies suggest that this effect is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. In humans, epigenetic studies to investigate the influence of ELS on psychiatric phenotypes are limited by the inaccessibility of living brain tissue. Due to the tissue-specific nature of epigenetic signatures, it is impossible to determine whether ELS induced epigenetic changes in accessible peripheral cells, for example, blood lymphocytes, reflect epigenetic changes in the brain. To overcome these limitations, we applied a cross-species approach involving: (i) the analysis of CD34+ cells from human cord blood; (ii) the examination of blood-derived CD3+ T cells of newborn and adolescent nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta); and (iii) the investigation of the prefrontal cortex of adult rats. Several regions in MORC1 (MORC family CW-type zinc finger 1; previously known as: microrchidia (mouse) homolog) were differentially methylated in response to ELS in CD34+ cells and CD3+ T cells derived from the blood of human and monkey neonates, as well as in CD3+ T cells derived from the blood of adolescent monkeys and in the prefrontal cortex of adult rats. MORC1 is thus the first identified epigenetic marker of ELS to be present in blood cell progenitors at birth and in the brain in adulthood. Interestingly, a gene-set-based analysis of data from a genome-wide association study of major depressive disorder (MDD) revealed an association of MORC1 with MDD.

In particular, it is unclear whether programs that practice dual-tasking are more effective in improving divided attention than programs focusing on flexible allocation priority training. The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to compare the efficacy of different types of attentional training formats and (2) to assess transfer to distal measures. Forty-two healthy older adults were randomly assigned to one of three training groups. In the SINGLE training condition, participants practiced a visual detection and an alphanumeric equation task in isolation. In the FIXED training condition, participants practiced both tasks simultaneously with equal attention allocated to each. In the VARIABLE training condition, participants varied the attentional priority allocated to each task. After training, all participants improved their performance on the alphanumeric equation task when performed individually, including those in the SINGLE training condition. Participants in the FIXED training condition improved their divided attention, but only the participants in the VARIABLE training condition showed a greater capacity to vary their attentional priorities according to the instructions. Regarding transfer, all groups improved their performance on the 2-back condition, but only the VARIABLE and FIXED conditions resulted in better performance on the 1-back condition. Overall, the study supports the notion that attentional control capacities in older adults are plastic and can be improved with appropriate training and that the type of training determines its impact on divided attention.

Research on the role of Th17 lymphocytes in MS pathogenesis has made significant progress in identifying various immunological as well as environmental factors that induce the differentiation and expansion of these cells, different subsets of Th17 cells with varying degrees of pathogenicity, and the role of the secreted effector cytokines. While approved therapies for MS offer significant benefit to patients, there remain unmet needs. Ongoing clinical trials aim to translate the advanced knowledge of Th17 cytokines to improved therapies. This review discusses the current status and future developments of research into the role of Th17 and related cytokines in MS pathogenesis and therapy. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional primary endpoints for acute SCI clinical trials are too broad to assess functional recovery in cervical subjects, raising the possibility of false positive outcomes in trials for cervical SCI. Endpoints focused on the recovery of hand and arm control (e.g., upper extremity motor score, motor level change) show the most potential for use as primary outcomes in upcoming trials of cervical SCI. As the field moves forward, the most reliable way to ensure meaningful clinical testing in cervical subjects may be the development of a composite primary endpoint that measures both neurological recovery and functional improvement.

This article summarizes work by our team and others on the connections among young children's sleep, their executive functioning, and the quality of their caregiving relationships. Overall, children exposed to higher-quality parenting perform better on executive tasks and get sleep of higher quality or duration. In turn, sleep relates to subsequent executive performance, while also modulating the links between parenting and child outcomes. We propose directions for future research to address causal relations and to better pinpoint the direction and magnitude of the associations between these areas of child development.

These techniques have opened new avenues to discover the molecular basis of epileptogenesis and to study the physiologic effects of mutations in epilepsy-associated genes on a multilayer level, from cells to circuits. This manuscript reviews recently published applications of these new genetic technologies in the study of epilepsy, as well as work presented by the authors at the genetic session of the XII Workshop on the Neurobiology of Epilepsy (WONOEP 2013) in Quebec, Canada. Next-generation sequencing is providing investigators with an unbiased means to assess the molecular causes of sporadic forms of epilepsy and has revealed the complexity and genetic heterogeneity of sporadic epilepsy disorders. To assess the functional impact of mutations in these newly identified genes on specific neuronal cell types during brain development, new modeling strategies in animals, including conditional genetics in mice and in utero knock-down approaches, are enabling functional validation with exquisite cell-type and temporal specificity. In addition, optogenetics, using cell-type-specific Cre recombinase driver lines, is enabling investigators to dissect networks involved in epilepsy. In addition, genetically encoded cell-type labeling is providing new means to assess the role of the nonneuronal components of epileptic networks such as glial cells. Furthermore, beyond its role in revealing coding variants involved in epileptogenesis, next-generation sequencing can be used to assess the epigenetic modifications that lead to sustained network hyperexcitability in epilepsy, including methylation changes in gene promoters and noncoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) involved in modifying gene expression following seizures. In addition, genetically based bioluminescent reporters are providing new opportunities to assess neuronal activity and neurotransmitter levels both in vitro and in vivo in the context of epilepsy. Finally, genetically rederived neurons generated from patient induced pluripotent stem cells and genetically modified zebrafish have become high-throughput means to investigate disease mechanisms and potential new therapies. Genetics has changed the field of epilepsy research considerably, and is paving the way for better diagnosis and therapies for patients with epilepsy.

OA is often accompanied by inflammation and pain, whereby cytokines associated with chronic OA can up-regulate expression of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF). Several studies suggest a role for cytokines and NGF in OA pain, however the effects of changing mechanical properties in OA tissue on chondrocyte metabolism remain unclear. Here, we used high-extension silicone rubber membranes to examine if high mechanical strain (HMS) of primary articular chondrocytes increases inflammatory gene expression and promotes neurotrophic factor release. HMS cultured chondrocytes displayed up-regulated NGF, TNF alpha and ADAMTS4 gene expression while decreasing TLR2 expression, as compared to static controls. HMS culture increased p38 MAPK activity compared to static controls. Conditioned medium from HMS dynamic cultures, but not static cultures, induced significant neurite sprouting in PC12 cells. The increased neurite sprouting was accompanied by consistent increases in PC12 cell death. Low-frequency high-magnitude mechanical strain of primary articular chondrocytes in vitro drives factor secretion associated with degenerative joint disease and joint pain. This study provides evidence for a direct link between cellular strain, secretory factors, neo-innervation, and pain in OA pathology.

Here we estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance in the brain response to facial expressions explained by common genetic variance captured by similar to 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Using genomic-relationship-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML), we related this global genetic variance to that in the brain response to facial expressions, as assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a community-based sample of adolescents (n = 1,620). Brain response to facial expressions was measured in 25 regions constituting a face network, as defined previously. In 9 out of these 25 regions, common genetic variance explained a significant proportion of phenotypic variance (40-50%) in their response to ambiguous facial expressions; this was not the case for angry facial expressions. Across the network, the strength of the genotype-phenotype relationship varied as a function of the inter-individual variability in the number of functional connections possessed by a given region (R-2 = 0.38, p < 0.001). Furthermore, this variability showed an inverted U relationship with both the number of observed connections (R-2 = 0.48, p < 0.001) and the magnitude of brain response (R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.001). Thus, a significant proportion of the brain response to facial expressions is predicted by common genetic variance in a subset of regions constituting the face network. These regions show the highest inter-individual variability in the number of connections with other network nodes, suggesting that the genetic model captures variations across the adolescent brains in co-opting these regions into the face network.

Genetic Association Signal Near NTN4 in Tourette Syndrome	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							GENOMEWIDE ASSOCIATION; HISTIDINE-DECARBOXYLASE; VARIANTS; SLITRK1; SAMPLE; SCANS	Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex genetic etiology. Through an international collaboration, we genotyped 42 single nucleotide polymorphisms (p < 10(-3)) from the recent TS genomewide association study (GWAS) in 609 independent cases and 610 ancestry-matched controls. Only rs2060546 on chromosome 12q22 (p = 3.3 x 10 (-4)) remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Meta-analysis with the original GWAS yielded the strongest association to date (p = 5.8 x 10 (7)). Although its functional significance is unclear, rs2060546 lies closest to NTN4, an axon guidance molecule expressed in developing striatum. Risk score analysis significantly predicted case-control status (p - 0.042), suggesting that many of these variants are true TS risk alleles.

The planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is a highly conserved, noncanonical Wnt-Frizzled-Dishevelled signaling cascade, that was first identified in the fruit fly Drosophila. We are here reviewing the role of the PCP pathway genes in the etiology of human NTDs, updating the list of the rare and deleterious mutations identified so far. We report 50 rare nonsynonymous mutations of PCP genes in 54 patients having a pathogenic effect on the protein function. Thirteen mutations that have previously been reported as novel are now reported in public databases, although at very low frequencies. The mutations were private, mostly missense, and transmitted by a healthy parent. To date, no clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been possible to create. Even if PCP pathway genes are involved in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects, future studies will be necessary to better dissect the genetic causes underlying these complex malformations.

Since then, they have been shown to be critical for short distance cell-cell interactions in the nervous system. The interest in their function has not abated, leading to ever-more sophisticated studies generating as many surprising answers about their function as new questions. We discuss recent insights into their functions in the developing nervous system, including neuronal progenitor sorting, stochastic cell migration, guidance of neuronal growth cones, topographic map formation, as well as synaptic plasticity.

Epigenetic modifications, including methylation changes in the TrkB promoter, partially explain TrkB-T1 low expression levels in brain tissue from suicide completers. The aim of this study was to investigate whether methylation changes in other regions of the TrkB gene could also contribute to the significant downregulation of the TrkB-T1 transcript observed in the brain of suicide completers. Methylation levels were assessed on BA8/9 from suicide completers expressing low TrkB-T1 transcript levels and controls, using custom-made Agilent arrays tiling the whole TrkB gene. After statistical correction for multiple testing, five probes located in the TrkB-T1 3'UTR region were found hypermethylated in the frontal cortex of suicide completers. These results were validated for four CpGs spanning a 150 bp sequence by cloning and Sanger sequencing bisulfite treated DNA. We found a significant correlation between the methylation level at these four CpGs and TrkB-T1 expression in BA8/9. Site-specific hypermethylation on this 3'UTR sequence induced decreased luciferase activity in reporter gene cell assays.

Upregulation of Dopamine D3, Not D2, Receptors Correlates With Tardive Dyskinesia in a Primate Model	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						dopamine receptors; antipsychotic drugs; basal ganglia; tardive dyskinesia	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; D-3 RECEPTOR; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS; HALOPERIDOL TREATMENT; DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID; ORAL DYSKINESIAS; GENE-EXPRESSION	Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a delayed and potentially irreversible motor complication arising in patients chronically exposed to centrally active dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, including antipsychotic drugs and metoclopramide. The classical dopamine D2 receptor supersensitivity hypothesis in TD, which stemmed from rodent studies, lacks strong support in humans. To investigate the neurochemical basis of TD, we chronically exposed adult capuchin monkeys to haloperidol (median, 18.5 months; n = 11) or clozapine (median, 6 months; n = 6). Six unmedicated animals were used as controls. Five haloperidol-treated animals developed mild TD movements, and no TD was observed in the clozapine group. Using receptor autoradiography, we measured striatal dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptor levels. We also examined the D3 receptor/preprotachykinin messenger RNA (mRNA) co-expression, and quantified preproenkephalin mRNA levels, in striatal sections. Unlike clozapine, haloperidol strongly induced dopamine D3 receptor binding sites in the anterior caudate-putamen, particularly in TD animals, and binding levels positively correlated with TD intensity. Interestingly, the D3 receptor upregulation was observed in striatonigral neurons. In contrast, D2 receptor binding was comparable to controls, and dopamine D1 receptor binding was reduced in the anterior putamen. Enkephalin mRNA widely increased in all animals, but to a greater extent in TD-free animals. These results suggest for the first time that upregulated striatal D3 receptors correlate with TD in nonhuman primates, adding new insights to the dopamine receptor supersensitivity hypothesis. The D3 receptor could provide a novel target for drug intervention in human TD.

The worldwide prevalence of the disease in the general population is 0.9%, increasing to 4.6% in individuals >= 65 years old. Standard pharmaceutical treatments are only moderately effective, reducing tremor amplitudes in similar to 50% of patients, a phenomenon partly explained by the fact that the diagnosis of ET is based solely on clinical findings rather than biological markers. Furthermore, the pathophysiological origin of ET remains controversial, leading to heated debates as to whether it should be considered a neurodegenerative disorder or as a dynamic oscillatory disturbances of neurologic origin. Progress has been made in the understanding of its etiology as it is now accepted that genetic components must at least explain the familial cases of ET, and the evidence implicating the olivocerebellar and cerebellothalamo-cortical pathways is strong. However, a strong disconnection between human genetics, pathophysiological, and mouse genetics studies exists in the field of ET, with little use of all the knowledge gathered from the different research disciplines. This review highlights our current knowledge on ET from both a human population and mouse genetics perspective hoping to reconcile evidence from both fields and leading to novel clues guiding future studies. We argue that better communication between researchers of different fields is warranted to define the biological origin of ET in the hope of leading to the development of better treatments.

Immunohistochemical and behavioral study using the SPARC (secreted protein, acidic, rich in cysteine)-null mouse model of low back pain (LBP) associated with accelerated intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. Objective. To determine if behavioral signs of LBP in SPARC-null mice are accompanied by sensory nervous system plasticity. Summary of Background Data. IVD pathology is a significant contributor to chronic LBP. In humans and rodents, decreased expression of SPARC is associated with IVD degeneration. We previously reported that SPARC-null mice exhibit age-dependent behavioral signs of chronic axial LBP and radiating leg pain. Methods. SPARC-null and age-matched control young, middle-aged, and old mice (1.5, 6, and 24 mo of age, respectively) were evaluated. Cutaneous hind paw sensitivity to cold, heat, and mechanical stimuli were evaluated as measures of radiating pain. The grip force and tail suspension assays were performed to evaluate axial LBP. Motor impairment was assessed using an accelerating rotarod. IVD innervation was identified by immunohistochemistry targeting the nerve fiber marker PGP9.5 and the sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Sensory nervous system plasticity was evaluated by quantification of CGRP- and neuropeptide-Y-immunoreactivity (-ir) in dorsal root ganglia neurons and CGRP-ir, GFAP-ir (astrocyte marker), and Iba-1-ir (microglia marker) in the spinal cord. Results. SPARC-null mice developed hypersensitivity to cold, axial discomfort, age-dependent motor impairment, age-dependent increases in sensory innervation in and around the IVDs, age-dependent upregulation of CGRP and neuropeptide-Y in dorsal root ganglia, and age-dependent upregulation of CGRP, microglia, and astrocytes in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Conclusion. Increased innervation of degenerating IVDs by sensory nerve fibers and the neuroplasticity in sensory neurons and spinal cord could contribute to the underlying pathobiology of chronic discogenic LBP.

Studies of GLP-1 reveal significant effects in regions of brain tissue that regulate appetite and satiety. GLP-1 mimetics are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. GLP-1 interacts with peripheral functions in which the autonomic nervous system plays an important role, and emerging pre-clinical findings indicate a potential neuroprotective role of the peptide, for example in models of stroke and in neurodegenerative disorders. A century ago, Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten described the steady-state enzyme kinetics that still apply to the multiple receptors, transporters and enzymes that define the biochemical reactions of the brain, including the glucose-dependent impact of GLP-1 on blood-brain glucose transfer and metabolism. This MiniReview examines the potential of GLP-1 as a molecule of interest for the understanding of brain energy metabolism and with reference to the impact on brain metabolism related to appetite and satiety regulation, stroke and neurodegenerative disorders. These effects can be understood only by reference to the original formulation of the Michaelis-Menten equation as applied to a chain of kinetically controlled steps. Indeed, the effects of GLP-1 receptor activation on blood-brain glucose transfer and brain metabolism of glucose depend on the glucose concentration and relative affinities of the steps both in vitro and in vivo, as in the pancreas.

At the single-cell level, adapting A17 neurons to a non-preferred orientation (adaptor) shifts their preferred orientation either towards the adaptor (attractive shift) or away from it (repulsive shift). As A17 and A18 are reciprocally connected, we sought to determine how changes in preferred orientations in A18 neurons are correlated with changes recorded in A17 anesthetised cats. To this end, we simultaneously traced populations of neurons in A17 and A18, using intrinsic optical imaging, before and after long (12 min) and short (3 min) adaptations. The comparison of A17 and A18 maps pre-adaptation and post-adaptation showed that variance in shift amplitudes is greater in A18 than A17 for short adaptations. Our results indicate a rapid reconfiguration of functional maps that may spread to many cortical areas.

It is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 ('Fragile X Mental Retardation 1') gene, which prevents expression of the 'Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein' (FMRP). In FXS, the absence of FMRP leads to altered structural and functional development of the synapse, while preventing activity-based synapse maturation and synaptic pruning, which are essential for normal brain development and cognitive development. Possible impairments in information processing can be non-invasively investigated using electrophysiology. Methods: We compared auditory (AEP) and visual (VEP) evoked potentials in twelve adolescents and young adults (10-22 years) affected by FXS to healthy controls matched by chronological age (N = 12) and developmental age of cognitive functioning (N = 9; 5-7 years), using analysis of variance. Results: In the visual modality, the N70 and N2 amplitude have been found increased in FXS in comparison. to the chronological, but not the developmental control group at occipital sites, whereas in the auditory modality N1, P2 and N2 amplitude as well as N2 latency have been found increased in FXS, relative to both chronological and developmental control groups at mid-central sites. Conclusions: The AEP/VEP profile suggests disruptions in sensory processing specific to FXS that exceed immaturity of physiological activity. In addition, the auditory modality seems to be more affected than the visual modality. Results are discussed in light of possible underlying neuronal mechanisms, including deficits in synaptic pruning and neuronal inhibition that might account for a hyperreactive nervous system in FXS.

Ten young and ten elderly French-speaking participants were trained by means of a computerized Spanish word program. Both age groups reached a similar naming accuracy, but the elderly required significantly more time. Despite equivalent performance, distinct neural networks characterized the ceiling. While the young cohort showed subcortical activations, the elderly recruited the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left lingual gyrus and the precuneus. The learning trajectory of the elderly, the neuroimaging findings together with their performance on the Stroop suggest that the young adults relied on control processing areas whereas the elderly relied on episodic memory circuits, which may reflect resorting to better preserved cognitive resources. Finally, the recruitment of visual processing areas by the elderly may reflect the impact of the language training method used. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Wavelet-Based Localization of Oscillatory Sources From Magnetoencephalography Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electrophysiological imaging; epilepsy; inverse problem; magnetoencephalography (MEG); maximum entropy on the mean (MEM); wavelet representation	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MAXIMUM STATISTICAL ENTROPY; BIOMAGNETIC INVERSE PROBLEM; HUMAN BRAIN; EPILEPTIC PATIENTS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; EEG; MEG; RECONSTRUCTION	Transient brain oscillatory activities recorded with Eelectroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) are characteristic features in physiological and pathological processes. This study is aimed at describing, evaluating, and illustrating with clinical data a new method for localizing the sources of oscillatory cortical activity recorded by MEG. The method combines time-frequency representation and an entropic regularization technique in a common framework, assuming that brain activity is sparse in time and space. Spatial sparsity relies on the assumption that brain activity is organized among cortical parcels. Sparsity in time is achieved by transposing the inverse problem in the wavelet representation, for both data and sources. We propose an estimator of the wavelet coefficients of the sources based on the maximum entropy on the mean (MEM) principle. The full dynamics of the sources is obtained from the inverse wavelet transform, and principal component analysis of the reconstructed time courses is applied to extract oscillatory components. This methodology is evaluated using realistic simulations of single-trial signals, combining fast and sudden discharges (spike) along with bursts of oscillating activity. The method is finally illustrated with a clinical application using MEG data acquired on a patient with a right orbitofrontal epilepsy.	[Lina, J.

It is based on the decomposition of the cell output current into photocurrent and junction current. The photocurrent is linearly dependent on solar irradiance and cell temperature; consequently, its analytical computation is done easily. However, the junction current is highly non-linear and depends on cell voltage and temperature. Therefore, its analytical computation is complicated and the manufacturers do not supply any information about this parameter. Moreover, there is no way to measure it physically. Therefore, it is proposed to use the ANFIS algorithm as a powerful technique in order to estimate this current and reconstruct the output PV cell current using the photocurrent. The model validation is based on the gradient descent and chain rule applied to a set of data different than the one used for training process. The advantage of the proposed model is that only one climatic parameter is used as the input to the ANFIS algorithm, which makes it less sensitive to climatic variations.

J	Keays, G; Dumas, A				Keays, Glenn; Dumas, Alex			Longboard and skateboard injuries	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Adolescent; Athletic injuries/epidemiology; Accidental falls/statistics & numerical data*; Skating/injuries*		Introduction: The causes and events related to skateboarding injuries have been widely documented. However, little is known about longboard-related injuries. With five deaths linked to longboarding in the United States and Canada in 2012, some cities are already considering banning the practice. This study compared the types and causes of longboarding-related injuries to those associated with skateboarding. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, using an emergency-based surveillance system, on patients under the age of 18 who had been injured while longboarding or skateboarding between 2006 and 2010. Results: A total of 287 longboarding and 4198 skateboarding cases were identified. There were more females in the longboarding group (18.8%) than in the skateboarding one (10.7%, p < 0.002). All the injured longboarders were older than 10 years of age while a fifth of the injured skateboarders were under the age of 11. Longboarders' injuries occurred mainly on streets and roads (75.3% vs. 34.3% in skateboarders, p < 0.000) and rarely in skate parks (1.4% vs. 26.4% in skateboarders, p < 0.000). Longboarders suffered twice as many injuries to their heads and necks (23.3% vs. 13.1%, p < 0.000) and twice as many severe neurological traumas (8.6 vs. 3.7%, p < 0.000) while skateboarders suffered more injuries to their lower extremities (33.7% vs. 24.7%, p < 0.002). Conclusion: Longboarding is associated with a different pattern of injuries than skateboarding. Because longboarders suffer more intracranial injuries, the importance of helmet use should be especially strongly reinforced. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zayed, T; Mahmoud, M				Zayed, Tarek; Mahmoud, Muhammad			Neurofuzzy-Based Productivity Prediction Model for Horizontal Directional Drilling	JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Horizontal directional drilling (HDD); Productivity; Neurofuzzy; Model	SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE	Productivity prediction and cost estimation of horizontal directional drilling (HDD) as a trenchless technology technique involves a large number of objective and subjective factors, which should be carefully identified and studied. To consider the effect of these factors on productivity prediction, the research presented in this paper assists in developing a productivity model for HDD operations. Potential factors impacting productivity are identified and studied based upon the literature and HDD experts across North America and abroad. A neurofuzzy (NF) approach is employed to develop the HDD productivity prediction model operating in clay, rock, and sandy soils. The merits of this approach involve decreasing uncertainties in results, addressing nonlinear relationships, and dealing well with imprecise and linguistic data. The NF model is tested using actual project data, which showed robust results with average validity percentages of 94.7, 82.3, and 86.7% for clay, rock, and sandy soils, respectively. The model is also used to produce productivity curves (production rate versus influencing factors) for each soil type. An automated user-friendly productivity prediction tool (HDD-PP) is developed to predict HDD productivity based on the NF model. This analysis has proved helpful for contractors, consultants, and HDD professionals in predicting execution time and estimating cost of HDD projects during the preconstruction phase.

J	Rouibi, K; Rompre, PP				Rouibi, Khalil; Rompre, Pierre-Paul			Role of context in neurotensin-induced sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effect of amphetamine	PEPTIDES			English	Article						Amphetamine; Context; Neurotensin; Sensitization	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; ENDOGENOUS NEUROTENSIN; RECEPTORS; ACTIVATION; ADDICTION; BLOCKADE; MORPHINE; NEURONS	Previous studies have shown that repeated central injections of neurotensin, or its active analog, D-Tyr([11])neurotensin, sensitize to the locomotor stimulant effect of amphetamine. The development of sensitization to amphetamine can be modulated by contextual stimuli associated with the drug and as a consequence the expression of sensitization becomes context-dependent. The present study was thus aimed at determining whether the induction of amphetamine sensitization by neurotensin is modulated by the context in which neurotensin is administered. Different groups of adult male Long Evans rats were injected on four occasions with D-Tyr([11])ineurotensin (18 nmol/10 mu l; i.c.v.) in the locomotor activity cages (paired group) or in their home cage (unpaired group); control group received vehicle injection in both environments. One week after the last central injection, the locomotor response to a single dose of amphetamine (0.75 mg/kg; i.p.) was measured in all the rats. Results show that amphetamine induced higher ambulatory, non-ambulatory and vertical activity in the paired group than in the control group confirming the sensitization effect. The paired group also displayed significant higher ambulatory activity than those in the unpaired group, confirming that the expression of sensitization was context-dependent. This context-dependency was not found however for amphetamine-induced non-ambulatory and vertical activity suggesting that neurotensin can induce both a context-dependent and context-independent sensitization.

Influences of Maternal and Paternal PTSD on Epigenetic Regulation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor Gene in Holocaust Survivor Offspring	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; PARENTAL PTSD; CHILDHOOD; METHYLATION; DEPRESSION; TRAUMA; MALTREATMENT; VALIDATION; RESPONSES; EXPOSURE	Objective: Differential effects of maternal and paternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been observed in adult offspring of Holocaust survivors in both glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity and vulnerability to psychiatric disorder. The authors examined the relative influences of maternal and paternal PTSD on DNA methylation of the exon 1(F) promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-1(F)) gene (NR3C1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and its relationship to glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity in Holocaust offspring. Method: Adult offspring with at least one Holocaust survivor parent (N=80) and demographically similar participants without parental Holocaust exposure or parental PTSD (N=15) completed clinical interviews, self-report measures, and biological procedures. Blood samples were collected for analysis of GR-1(F) promoter methylation and of cortisol levels in response to low-dose dexamethasone, and two-way analysis of covariance was performed using maternal and paternal PTSD as main effects. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to permit visualization of maternal compared with paternal PTSD effects on clinical variables and GR-1(F). promoter methylation. Results: A significant interaction demonstrated that in the absence of maternal PTSD, offspring with paternal PTSD showed higher GR-1(F) promoter methylation, whereas offspring with both maternal and paternal PTSD showed lower methylation. Lower GR-1(F) promoter methylation was significantly associated with greater post-dexamethasone cortisol suppression. The clustering analysis revealed that maternal and paternal PTSD effects were differentially associated with clinical indicators and GR-1(F) promoter methylation. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate alterations of GR-1(F) promoter methylation in relation to parental PTSD and neuroendocrine outcomes. The moderation of paternal PTSD effects by maternal PTSD suggests different mechanisms for the intergenerational transmission of trauma-related vulnerabilities.

Brainstem processing of vestibular sensory exafference: implications for motion sickness etiology	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Review						Motion sickness; Brainstem; Cerebellum; Sensory conflict; Nausea; Vomiting	MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; SPATIAL ORIENTATION; SELF-MOTION; NERVE AFFERENTS; MOTOR CONTROL; CEREBELLUM; SYSTEM; MODEL; STIMULATION; RESPONSES	The origin of the internal "sensory conflict" stimulus causing motion sickness has been debated for more than four decades. Recent studies show a subclass of neurons in the vestibular nuclei and deep cerebellar nuclei that respond preferentially to passive head movements. During active movement, the semicircular canal and otolith input ("reafference") to these neurons are canceled by a mechanism comparing the expected consequences of self-generated movement (estimated with an internal model-presumably located in the cerebellum) with the actual sensory feedback. The un-canceled component ("exafference") resulting from passive movement normally helps compensate for unexpected postural disturbances. Notably, the existence of such vestibular "sensory conflict" neurons had been postulated as early as 1982, but their existence and putative role in posture control and motion sickness have been long debated. Here, we review the development of "sensory conflict" theories in relation to recent evidence for brainstem and cerebellar reafference cancelation, and identify some open research questions. We propose that conditions producing persistent activity of these neurons, or their targets, stimulate nearby brainstem emetic centers-via an as yet unidentified mechanism. We discuss how such a mechanism is consistent with the notable difference in motion sickness susceptibility of drivers as opposed to passengers, human immunity to normal self-generated movement and why head restraint or lying horizontal confers relative immunity. Finally, we propose that fuller characterization of these mechanisms and their potential role in motion sickness could lead to more effective, scientifically based prevention and treatment for motion sickness.

However, the neural and physiological mechanisms underlying this impairment are entirely unknown. Here, we sought to identify, through functional magnetic resonance imaging during MSL and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during daytime sleep, the functional correlates and physiological characteristics of this age-related motor memory deficit. As predicted, older subjects did not exhibit sleep-dependent gains in performance (i.e., behavioral changes that reflect consolidation) and had reduced sleep spindles compared with young subjects. Brain imaging analyses also revealed that changes in activity across the retention interval in the putamen and related brain regions were associated with sleep spindles. This change in striatal activity was increased in young subjects, but reduced by comparison in older subjects. These findings suggest that the deficit in sleep-dependent motor memory consolidation in elderly individuals is related to a reduction in sleep spindle oscillations and to an associated decrease of activity in the cortico-striatal network.

General and specific abilities capture distinguishable, but related, facets of the intelligence construct. Here, we analyze gray matter with three morphometric indices (volume, cortical surface area, and cortical thickness) at three levels of the intelligence hierarchy (tests, first-order factors, and a higher-order general factor, g). A group of one hundred and four healthy young adults completed a cognitive battery and underwent high-resolution structural MRI. Latent scores were computed for the intelligence factors and tests were also analyzed. The key finding reveals substantial variability in gray matter correlates at the test level, which is substantially reduced for the first-order and the higher-order factors. This supports a reversed hierarchy in the brain with respect to cognitive abilities at different psychometric levels: the greater the generality, the smaller the number of relevant gray matter clusters accounting for individual differences in intelligent performance.

The purpose of this study was to determine the independent contribution of clinical pain, psychological factors and neuromuscular adaptations to disability in patients with chronic low back pain. Clinical pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, fear-avoidance beliefs, anxiety, neuromuscular adaptations to chronic pain and neuromuscular responses to experimental pain were assessed in 52 patients with chronic low back pain. Lumbar muscle electromyographic activity was assessed during a flexion-extension task (flexion relaxation phenomenon) to assess both chronic neuromuscular adaptations and neuromuscular responses to experimental pain during the task. Multiple regressions showed that independent predictors of disability included neuromuscular adaptations to chronic pain (beta = 0.25, p = 0.006, sr(2) = 0.06), neuromuscular responses to experimental pain (beta = -0.24, p = 0.011, sr(2) = 0.05), clinical pain intensity (beta = 0.28, p = 0.002, sr(2) = 0.08) and psychological factors (beta = 0.58, p < 0.001, sr(2) = 0.32). Together, these predictors accounted for 65% of variance in disability (R-2 = 0.65 p < 0.001). The current investigation revealed that neuromuscular adaptations are independent from clinical pain intensity and psychological factors, and contribute to inter-individual differences in patients' disability. This suggests that disability, in chronic low back pain patients, is determined by a combination of factors, including clinical pain, psychological factors and neuromuscular adaptations.

There is an increasing need for reliable, early, pre-motor diagnosis of PD, since motor symptoms occur when there is already significant neuronal loss. Recent prospective studies have shown that over 80 % of idiopathic RBD patients over time converted to PD and related synucleinopathies. RBD patients have autonomic, visual, and olfactory dysfunction as well as neuroimaging abnormalities similar to those seen in PD. Studies have shown that neuroimaging abnormalities and visual and olfactory dysfunction can help predict which RBD patients will likely convert to a neurodegenerative diagnosis within a short follow-up period. These factors make RBD an ideal population for prediction to PD conversion, allowing future testing and eventual use of neuroprotective strategies.

Prolonged survival in adult neurofibromatosis type I patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with bevacizumab	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Neurofibromatosis; Glioblastoma; Angiogenesis; Bevacizumab	INTEGRATED GENOMIC ANALYSIS; MOYAMOYA SYNDROME; NF1 GENE; GLIOBLASTOMA; CHILDREN; INDIVIDUALS; AGE-10; TUMORS	Astrocytic tumors, especially optic pathway pilocytic astrocytomas, are common in pediatric NF1 patients. High-grade gliomas (HGGs) appear to be rare in adult and pediatric NF1 patients. This is a series of five consecutive, adult NF1 patients with recurrent HGGs treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Four patients met consensus clinical criteria for NF1 and one patient had presumed segmental NF1. Three patients had glioblastomas, one gliosarcoma, and one progressive, enhancing optic pathway glioma which was not biopsied. Two tumors had molecular testing performed; both were IDH wild type and activating oncogene mutations (1 BRAFV600E and 1 PIK3CA mutation) were found in these tumors. All five patients received bevacizumab-containing regimens at tumor recurrence. The median number of 4-week cycles of bevacizumab was 20. All five patients experienced prolonged post-recurrence survival following bevacizumab treatment ranging from ten to 72 months. The median overall survival from HGG diagnosis was 72.6 months with three patients alive and progression free at last follow-up. Three out of five patients developed vascular complications leading to bevacizumab discontinuation. In this case series, adult NF1 patients with recurrent HGGs had prolonged, post-recurrence survival after treatment with bevacizumab-containing regimens. Based on these results, further study of antiangiogenic therapy in NF1 patients with HGGs and bevacizumab-response in sporadic HGG patients with NF1-mutated tumors is warranted.

Copy Number Variation in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Tourette Syndrome: A Cross-Disorder Study	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Tourette syndrome; obsessive-compulsive disorder; copy number variation; genetics; 16p13.11	RARE CHROMOSOMAL DELETIONS; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; DE-NOVO CNVS; DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITIES; 16P13.11 PREDISPOSE; VARIANTS; DUPLICATIONS; AUTISM; SCHIZOPHRENIA; GENETICS	Objective: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS) are heritable neurodevelopmental disorders with a partially shared genetic etiology. This study represents the first genome-wide investigation of large (>500 kb), rare (<1%) copy number variants (CNVs) in OCD and the largest genome-wide CNV analysis in TS to date. Method: The primary analyses used a cross-disorder design for 2,699 case patients (1,613 ascertained for OCD, 1,086 ascertained for TS) and 1,789 controls. Parental data facilitated a de novo analysis in 348 OCD trios. Results: Although no global CNV burden was detected in the cross-disorder analysis or in secondary, disease-specific analyses, there was a 3.3-fold increased burden of large deletions previously associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders (p = .09). Half of these neurodevelopmental deletions were located in a single locus, 16p13.11 (5 case patient deletions: 0 control deletions, p = .08 in the current study, p = .025 compared to published controls). Three 16p13.11 deletions were confirmed de novo, providing further support for the etiological significance of this region. The overall OCD de novo rate was 1.4%, which is intermediate between published rates in controls (0.7%) and in individuals with autism or schizophrenia (2-4%). Conclusion: Several converging lines of evidence implicate 16p13.11 deletions in OCD, with weaker evidence for a role in TS. The trend toward increased overall neurodevelopmental CNV burden in TS and OCD suggests that deletions previously associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders may also contribute to these phenotypes.

Evaluation of muscle force classification using shape analysis of the sEMG probability density function: a simulation study	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						sEMG and force modeling; Muscle force classification; Non-Gaussianity; Probability density function; Core shape model; High-order statistics	SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAM SIGNAL; HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS; EMG; PARAMETERS	In this work, we propose to classify, by simulation, the shape variability (or non-Gaussianity) of the surface electromyogram (sEMG) amplitude probability density function (PDF), according to contraction level, using high-order statistics (HOS) and a recent functional formalism, the core shape modeling (CSM). According to recent studies, based on simulated and/or experimental conditions, the sEMG PDF shape seems to be modified by many factors as: contraction level, fatigue state, muscle anatomy, used instrumentation, and also motor control parameters. For sensitivity evaluation against these several sources (physiological, instrumental, and neural control) of variability, a large-scale simulation (25 muscle anatomies, ten parameter configurations, three electrode arrangements) is performed, by using a recent sEMG-force model and parallel computing, to classify sEMG data from three contraction levels (20, 50, and 80 % MVC). A shape clustering algorithm is then launched using five combinations of HOS parameters, the CSM method and compared to amplitude clustering with classical indicators [average rectified value (ARV) and root mean square (RMS)]. From the results screening, it appears that the CSM method obtains, using Laplacian electrode arrangement, the highest classification scores, after ARV and RMS approaches, and followed by one HOS combination. However, when some critical confounding parameters are changed, these scores decrease. These simulation results demonstrate that the shape screening of the sEMG amplitude PDF is a complex task which needs both efficient shape analysis methods and specific signal recording protocol to be properly used for tracking neural drive and muscle activation strategies with varying force contraction in complement to classical amplitude estimators.

Nicotine consumption is regulated by a human polymorphism in dopamine neurons	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						dopamine system; human polymorphisms; in vivo electrophysiology; lentiviral vectors; mouse models; nicotinic receptor; nicotine self-administration; smoking	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR SUBUNIT; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; FIRING PATTERN; IN-VIVO; MICE; WITHDRAWAL; EXPRESSION; REINFORCEMENT; DEPENDENCE; ADDICTION	Smoking is the most important preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent genome-wide association studies highlighted a human haplotype on chromosome 15 underlying the risk for tobacco dependence and lung cancer. Several polymorphisms in the CHRNA3-CHRNA5-CHRNB4 cluster coding for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nAChR) a3, a5 and beta 4 subunits were implicated. In mouse models, we define a key role in the control of sensitivity to nicotine for the a5 subunit in dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We first investigated the reinforcing effects of nicotine in drug-naive a5(-/-) mice using an acute intravenous nicotine self-administration task and ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiological recordings of nicotine-elicited DA cell activation. We designed lentiviral re-expression vectors to achieve targeted re-expression of wild-type or mutant a5 in the VTA, in general, or in DA neurons exclusively. Our results establish a crucial role for a5*-nAChRs in DAergic neurons. These receptors are key regulators that determine the minimum nicotine dose necessary for DA cell activation and thus nicotine reinforcement. Finally, we demonstrate that a single-nucleotide polymorphism, the non-synonymous a5 variant rs16969968, frequent in many human populations, exhibits a partial loss of function of the protein in vivo. This leads to increased nicotine consumption in the self-administration paradigm. We thus define a critical link between a human predisposition marker, its expression in DA neurons and nicotine intake.

Biochemical analysis confirmed an isolated reduction in complex I activity. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a diffuse cystic leukoencephalopathy with the involvement of the corpus callosum and sparing of the gray matter. The clinical course was marked by an acute presentation of neurological deficits at 24 months followed by recurrent episodes of mild neurological deterioration, subsequent remissions, and prolonged periods of stability. This is one of the mildest known clinical presentations of complex I deficiency secondary to mutations in NDUFS1, expanding the clinical spectrum and natural history of this disorder. Consideration of clinical variability needs to be taken into account in patient management and family counseling.

Cold-water immersion decreases cerebral oxygenation but improves recovery after intermittent-sprint exercise in the heat	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS			English	Article						near-infrared spectroscopy; neuromuscular; heat strain; cold therapy; fatigue; muscle damage; cricket	PREFRONTAL CORTEX OXYGENATION; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; STRENUOUS EXERCISE; BLOOD-FLOW; PASSIVE HYPERTHERMIA; CYCLING PERFORMANCE; MUSCLE; TEMPERATURE; ACTIVATION; HUMANS	This study examined the effects of post-exercise cooling on recovery of neuromuscular, physiological, and cerebral hemodynamic responses after intermittent-sprint exercise in the heat. Nine participants underwent three post-exercise recovery trials, including a control (CONT), mixed-method cooling (MIX), and cold-water immersion (10 C; CWI). Voluntary force and activation were assessed simultaneously with cerebral oxygenation (nearinfrared spectroscopy) pre-and post-exercise, postintervention, and 1-h and 24-h post-exercise. Measures of heart rate, core temperature, skin temperature, muscle damage, and inflammation were also collected. Both cooling interventions reduced heart rate, core, and skin temperature post-intervention (P < 0.05). CWI hastened the recovery of voluntary force by 12.7 +/- 11.7% (mean +/- SD) and 16.3 +/- 10.5% 1-h post-exercise com-pared to MIX and CONT, respectively (P < 0.01). Voluntary force remained elevated by 16.1 +/- 20.5% 24-h post-exercise after CWI compared to CONT (P < 0.05). Central activation was increased post-intervention and 1-h post-exercise with CWI compared to CONT (P < 0.05), without differences between conditions 24-h post-exercise (P > 0.05). CWI reduced cerebral oxygenation compared to MIX and CONT post-intervention (P < 0.01). Furthermore, cooling interventions reduced cortisol 1-h post-exercise (P < 0.01), although only CWI blunted creatine kinase 24-h post-exercise compared to CONT (P < 0.05). Accordingly, improvements in neuromuscular recovery after post-exercise cooling appear to be disassociated with cerebral oxygenation, rather reflecting reductions in thermoregulatory demands to sustain force production.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of fatigue induced by a walking exercise on the strength, postural control, and gait of children with a neuromuscular disease. Design: Maximal isometric knee strength (extension and flexion), quiet standing postural control, and gait were evaluated in 12 children (8.8 [1.4] yrs) with a neuromuscular disease before and after a walking exercise. The participants were asked to stop walking when they considered themselves "very fatigued." Results: After the exercise-induced fatigue, a significant increase in range of motion in pelvis obliquity, hip abduction and adduction, and ankle flexion and extension during gait was reported along with an increase in stride length variability. Fatigue also reduced the knee flexor strength and had a detrimental effect on postural control. Conclusions: Fatigue affects the strength, postural control, and gait of children with a neuromuscular disease and could notably increase the risks of falling and the occurrence of serious injuries.

Aberrant expression of neuroendocrine markers in angiosarcoma: a potential diagnostic pitfall	HUMAN PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Angiosarcoma; Immunohistochemistry; Neuroendocrine neoplasms; Synaptophysin; Chromogranin A	EPITHELIOID SARCOMA; VASCULAR TUMORS; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL MARKER; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; DIFFERENTIATION; NEOPLASMS; LESIONS; CELL; ERG; CARCINOMA	Angiosarcomas (AS) are uncommon endothelial malignancies, usually arising from sun-damaged skin in older adults. Although most AS are readily diagnosed by light microscopy alone, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for endothelial markers such as CD31, CD34, FLI1 and ERG plays a valuable adjunctive role. However, IHC studies of AS must be interpreted with caution, as aberrant expression of markers such as cytokeratins, CD30, and CD117 may be seen. We report 3 cases of AS showing aberrant expression of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or chromogranin A, previously unreported phenomena. Cases presented as metastatic lesions in the lung of a 48-year-old woman and as primary tumors of the kidney and neck in a 29-year-old and a 51-year-old woman, respectively. All cases expressed synaptophysin and/or chromogranin A, and various neuroendocrine/endocrine neoplasms were strongly considered as diagnoses by the initial evaluating pathologists. Additional morphological study and confirmatory IHC for CD31, FLI1 and ERG established the diagnosis of AS in all cases. Coexpression of synaptophysin and chromogranin A in 1 case suggests that at least some AS show true neuroendocrine differentiation. Awareness of this potential diagnostic pitfall is important for correct diagnosis and treatment of this rare subset of AS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The voltage-gated calcium channel blocker lomerizine is neuroprotective in motor neurons expressing mutant SOD1, but not TDP-43	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; FUS; lomerizine; SOD1; TDP-43; voltage-gated calcium channel	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; CU/ZN-SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; SELECTIVE MOTONEURON VULNERABILITY; FRONTOTEMPORAL LOBAR DEGENERATION; TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL; AMPA RECEPTORS; MITOCHONDRIAL DYNAMICS; CULTURE MODEL; INTRACELLULAR CALCIUM; PARKINSONS-DISEASE	Excitotoxicity and disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis have been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and limiting Ca2+ entry is protective in models of ALS caused by mutation of SOD1. Lomerizine, an antagonist of L- and T-type voltage-gated calcium channels and transient receptor potential channel 5 transient receptor potential channels, is well tolerated clinically, making it a potential therapeutic candidate. Lomerizine reduced glutamate excitotoxicity in cultured motor neurons by reducing the accumulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and protected motor neurons against multiple measures of mutant SOD1 toxicity: Ca2+ overload, impaired mitochondrial trafficking, mitochondrial fragmentation, formation of mutant SOD1 inclusions, and loss of viability. To assess the utility of lomerizine in other forms of ALS, calcium homeostasis was evaluated in culture models of disease because of mutations in the RNA-binding proteins transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS). Calcium did not play the same role in the toxicity of these mutant proteins as with mutant SOD1 and lomerizine failed to prevent cytoplasmic accumulation of mutant TDP-43, a hallmark of its pathology. These experiments point to differences in the pathogenic pathways between types of ALS and show the utility of primary culture models in comparing those mechanisms and effectiveness of therapeutic strategies.

Most of the reported patients are of North American and European ancestry. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to review the clinical, radiological, and molecular characteristics of vanishing white matter disease in a cohort of French-Canadian patients. METHODS: Between 2004 and March 2012, five French-Canadian (non-Cree) patients from Quebec were clinically and genetically diagnosed with vanishing white matter disease within three Montreal Neurogenetics and Leukodystrophy clinics. Their clinical presentation and evolution, demographic characteristics, genetic mutations, and imaging were reviewed and compared with what is known in the literature. RESULTS: Sequencing of the exons and intronic boundaries of the EIF2B1-5 genes revealed a rare 260C>T (A87V) missense mutation in EIF2B3 in two homozygous patients and one compound heterozygous patient. This mutation was previously reported in only one patient in the literature. The carrier frequency is unknown. Also, three of five Quebec patients had an extremely rare vanishing white matter disease presentation of migraines with transient neurological abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The 260C>T (A87V) mutation in exon 3 of the EIF2B3 gene is likely a founder mutation for vanishing white matter disease in Quebec. Transient hemiparesthesia and hemiparesis episodes accompanied by headaches as presenting abnormalities of vanishing white matter disease are usually rare but seemed to be more frequent among the French-Canadian Quebec patients. They seemed to be preceded by periods of stress.

The clinical presentation of MTHFR deficiency is highly variable ranging from early neurological deterioration and death in infancy to a mild thrombophilia in adults. PATIENT AND METHODS: We describe an adolescent girl with a history of mild learning disabilities who presented at age 14 years with an epilepsy syndrome initially thought to be juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. She later developed intractable epilepsy with myoclonus, leg weakness, cognitive decline, and ataxia consistent with the syndrome of progressive myoclonic epilepsy. This prompted further evaluation that revealed elevated plasma homocysteine and decreased plasma methionine. The diagnosis of MTHFR deficiency was confirmed based on extremely reduced fibroblast MTHFR activity (0.3 nmol CHO/mg prot/hr) as well as mutation analysis that revealed two variants in the MTHFR gene, a splice site mutation p (IVS5-1G>A), as well as a missense mutation (c.155 G>A; p. Arg52Gln). Therapy with folinic acid, betaine, and methionine has produced significant clinical improvement, including improved strength, less severe ataxia, and decreased seizure frequency, as well as improvements in her electroencephalography and electromyography. CONCLUSION: This patient demonstrates the importance of considering MTHFR deficiency in the differential diagnosis of progressive myoclonic epilepsy because it is one of the few causes for which specific treatment is available.

Temperature dependence of vesicular dynamics at excitatory synapses of rat hippocampus	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Synaptic depression; Replenishment rate; Temperature; Model fitting; Excitatory synapse; Hippocampus	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; VESICLE POOL DEPLETION; MOTOR-NERVE TERMINALS; CHROMAFFIN CELLS; PHYSIOLOGICAL TEMPERATURES; SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION; TRANSMITTER RELEASE; ENDOCYTOSIS; MOBILITY; NEURONS	How vesicular dynamics parameters depend on temperature and how temperature affects the parameter change during prolonged high frequency stimulation was determined by fitting a model of vesicular storage and release to the amplitudes of the excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSC) recorded from CA1 neurons in rat hippocampal slices. The temperature ranged from low (13 A degrees C) to higher and more physiological temperature (34 A degrees C). Fitting the model of vesicular storage and release to the EPSC amplitudes during a single pair of brief high-low frequency stimulation trains yields the estimates of all parameters of the vesicular dynamics, and with good precision. Both fractional release and replenishment rate decrease as the temperature rises. Change of the underlying 'basic' parameters (release coupling, replenishment coupling and readily releasable pool size), which the model-fitting also yields is complex. The replenishment coupling between the readily releasable pool (RRP) and resting pool increases with temperature (which renders the replenishment rate higher), but this is more than counterbalanced by greater RRP size (which renders the replenishment rate lower). Finally, during long, high frequency patterned stimulation that leads to significant synaptic depression, the replenishment rate decreases markedly and rapidly at low temperatures (< 22 A degrees C), but at high temperatures (> 28 A degrees C) the replenishment rate rises with stimulation, making synapses better able to maintain synaptic efficacy.

Recent findings Although Parkinson's disease patients experience a wide range of nonmotor symptoms throughout the disease course, studies demonstrate that nonmotor features are not solely a late manifestation. Indeed, disturbances of smell, sleep, mood, and gastrointestinal function may herald Parkinson's disease or related synucleinopathies and precede these neurodegenerative conditions by 5 or more years. In addition, other nonmotor symptoms such as cognitive impairment are now recognized in incident or de-novo Parkinson's disease cohorts. Many of these nonmotor features reflect disturbances in nondopaminergic systems and early involvement of peripheral and central nervous systems, including olfactory, enteric, and brainstem neurons as in Braak's proposed pathological staging of Parkinson's disease. Current research focuses on identifying potential biomarkers that may detect persons at risk for Parkinson's disease and permit early intervention with neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapeutics. Summary Recent studies provide new insights into the frequency, pathophysiology, and importance of nonmotor features in Parkinson's disease as well as the recognition that these nonmotor symptoms occur in premotor, early, and later phases of Parkinson's disease.

Yet another, more subtle issue, relates to the relevance and quality of the contribution of scholarly bioethics to this debate. More specifically, how have various forms of speculation, anticipatory ethics, and methods to predict scientific trends and societal responses augmented or diminished this contribution? In this paper, we use the discussion of the ethics of cognitive enhancement to explore the positive and negative contribution of speculation in bioethics scholarship. First, we review and discuss how speculation has relied on different sets of assumptions regarding the non-medical use of stimulants, namely: (1) terminology and framing; (2) scientific aspects such as efficacy and safety; (3) estimates of prevalence and consequent normalization; and (4) the need for normative reflection and regulatory guidelines. Second, three methodological guideposts are proposed to alleviate some of the pitfalls of speculation: (1) acknowledge assumptions more explicitly and identify the value attributed to assumptions; (2) validate assumptions with interdisciplinary literature; and (3) adopt a broad perspective to promote more comprehensive reflection. We conclude that, through the examination of the controversy about cognitive enhancement, we can employ these methodological guideposts to enhance the value of contributions from bioethics and minimize potential epistemic and practical pitfalls in this case and perhaps in other areas of bioethical debate.

In human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged version of human MOP, we compared the signals triggered by the noninternalizing and internalizing MOP agonists morphine and DAMGO (Tyr-D-Ala- Gly-N-methyl-Phe-Gly-ol), respectively. We studied three major and well described components of MOP signaling: receptor internalization, G protein coupling, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/ERK2. Our results show that morphine and DAMGO display different profiles of receptor internalization and a similar ability to trigger the phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2. Our SPR analyses revealed that morphine and DAMGO evoke similar SPR signatures and that Gai, cAMP-dependent pathways, and ERK1/ERK2 have key roles in morphine-and DAMGO-mediated signaling. Most interestingly, we found that the so-called MOP neutral antagonists CTOP (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2), naloxone, and naltrexone behave like partial agonists. Even more intriguing, BRET experiments indicate that CTAP (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr- D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2) induces similar conformational changes as naltrexone at the Gai-bg interface, whereas it appears as an inverse agonist based on its SPR response thus indicating distinct signaling mechanisms for the two ligands. Taken together, our results support the usefulness of label-free methods such as SPR to study whole-cell responses and signaling cascades triggered by G protein-coupled receptors and complement the conventional approaches by revealing cellular responses that would have been otherwise undetectable.

The Ketamine Effect on ICP in Traumatic Brain Injury	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Review						Ketamine; ICP; Traumatic brain injury	SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; CGS 19755; GRADE; RECOMMENDATIONS; ANTAGONIST; HYPERTENSION; ANESTHESIA; CONSENSUS; SEDATION	Our goal was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the use of ketamine in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its effects on intracranial pressure (ICP). All articles from MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, HealthStar, Scopus, Cochrane Library, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (inception to November 2013), reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature were searched. Two reviewers independently identified all manuscripts pertaining to the administration of ketamine in human TBI patients that recorded effects on ICP. Secondary outcomes of effect on cerebral perfusion pressure, mean arterial pressure, patient outcome, and adverse effects were recorded. Two reviewers independently extracted data including population characteristics and treatment characteristics. The strength of evidence was adjudicated using both the Oxford and GRADE methodology. Our search strategy produced a total 371 citations. Seven articles, six manuscripts and one meeting proceeding, were considered for the review with all utilizing ketamine, while documenting ICP in severe TBI patients. All studies were prospective studies. Five and two studies pertained to adults and pediatrics, respectively. Across all studies, of the 101 adult and 55 pediatric patients described, ICP did not increase in any of the studies during ketamine administration. Three studies reported a significant decrease in ICP with ketamine bolus. Cerebral perfusion pressure and mean blood pressure increased in two studies, leading to a decrease in vasopressors in one. No significant adverse events related to ketamine were recorded in any of the studies. Outcome data were poorly documented. There currently exists Oxford level 2b, GRADE C evidence to support that ketamine does not increase ICP in severe TBI patients that are sedated and ventilated, and in fact may lower it in selected cases.

Steady-state visual-evoked potentials (ssVEPs) to field-specific radial checkerboards flickering at two cycle frequencies (7.5 and 6 Hz for central and peripheral stimulations, respectively) recorded at Oz were collected from 22 participants from 5 to 34 years old and from 5 visually impaired adolescents (12-16 years old). Responses from additional leads (POz, O1, O2), and the impact of gaze deviation on the signals, were also investigated in a subgroup of participants. Steady-state visual-evoked potentials responses were similar at all electrode sites, although the signal from the central stimulation was significantly higher at Oz and was highly sensitive in detecting gaze deviation. No effect of age or sex was found, indicating similar ssVEP responses between adults and healthy children. Visual acuity was related to the central signal when comparing healthy participants with four central visual impaired adolescents. Clinical validation of our electrophysiological protocol was also achieved in a 15-year-old adolescent with a severe peripheral visual deficit, as assessed with Goldmann perimetry. A single electrode over Oz is sufficient to gather both central and peripheral visual signals and also to control for gaze deviation. Our method presents several advantages in evaluating visual fields integrity, as it is fast, reliable, and efficient, and applicable in children as young as 5 years old. However, a larger sample of healthy children should be tested to establish clinical norms.

Alpha has been generally proposed to be associated with attention and memory and to be particularly important for the mediation of long-distance communication between neuronal populations. However, how these apply to object recognition is still unclear. This study aimed at describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of alpha rhythms while recognizing fragmented images of objects presented for the first time and presented again 24 hr later. Intracranial electro-encephalography was performed in six epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluation. Time-frequency analysis revealed a strong alpha activity, mainly of the evoked type, propagating from posterior cerebral areas to anterior regions, which was similar whether the objects were recognized or not. Phase coherence analysis, however, showed clear phase synchronization specific for the moment of recognition. Twenty-four hr later, frontal regions displayed stronger alpha activity and more distributed phase synchronization than when images were presented for the first time. In conclusion, alpha amplitude seems to be related to nonspecific mechanism. Phase coherence analysis suggests a communicational role of alpha activity in object recognition, which may be important for the comparison between bottom-up representations and memory templates.

ROC-Based Estimates of Neural-Behavioral Covariations Using Matched Filters	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE; DECISION-RELATED ACTIVITY; AREA MT; MOTION DETECTION; FUNCTIONAL-LINK; SPREAD-SPECTRUM; MACAQUE MT; NEURONS; SIGNALS; CHOICE	Correlations between responses in visual cortex and perceptual performance help draw a functional link between neural activity and visually guided behavior. These correlations are commonly derived with ROC-based neural-behavioral covariances (referred to as choice or detect probability) using boxcar analysis windows. Although boxcar windows capture the covariation between neural activity and behavior during steady-state stimulus presentations, they are not optimized to capture these correlations during short time-varying visual inputs. In this study, we implemented a matched-filter technique, combined with cross-validation, to improve the estimation of ROC-based neural-behavioral covariance under short and dynamic stimulus conditions. We show that this approach maximizes the area under the ROC curve and converges to the true neural-behavioral covariance using a Poisson spiking model. We also demonstrate that the matched filter, combined with cross-validation, reveals the dynamics of the neural-behavioral covariations of individual MT neurons during the detection of a brief motion stimulus.

We studied the ability of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan to cure or prevent AD hallmarks in aged (similar to 18 months at endpoint, 3 months treatment) or adult (similar to 12 months at endpoint, 10 months treatment) human amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. We tested learning and memory with the Morris water maze, and evaluated neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling using [F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET and laser Doppler flowmetry responses to whisker stimulation. Cerebrovascular reactivity was assessed with on-line videomicroscopy. We measured protein levels of oxidative stress enzymes (superoxide dismutases SOD1, SOD2 and NADPH oxidase subunit p67phox), and quantified soluble and deposited amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), AngII receptors AT1 and AT2, angiotensin IV receptor AT4, and cortical cholinergic innervation. In aged APP mice, losartan did not improve learning but it consolidated memory acquisition and recall, and rescued neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling and cerebrovascular dilatory capacity. Losartan normalized cerebrovascular p67phox and SOD2 protein levels and up-regulated those of SOD1. Losartan attenuated astrogliosis, normalized AT1 and AT4 receptor levels, but failed to rescue the cholinergic deficit and the A beta pathology. Given preventively, losartan protected cognitive function, cerebrovascular reactivity, and AT4 receptor levels. Like in aged APP mice, these benefits occurred without a decrease in soluble A beta species or plaque load. We conclude that losartan exerts potent preventive and restorative effects on AD hallmarks, possibly by mitigating AT1-initiated oxidative stress and normalizing memory-related AT4 receptors.

FTY720 readily accesses the CNS. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylated FTY720 (FTY720-p) enhances oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) survival, differentiation, and remyelination following experimentally induced demyelination in rodents. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, human fetal OPCs alone or in co-culture with rat dorsal root ganglia neurons (DRGN) were treated daily with FTY720-p, a condition that desensitizes cellular responses to S1P, the natural ligand of S1PR. In co-cultures, FTY720-p and S1P given daily or every three days increased the number of O1/MBP double positive cells and axonal ensheathment. In cultures composed of PDGFR alpha-antibody selected cells alone, daily application of FTY720-p also increased the number of O4/GC double positive cells. At an early time point (day 2), FTY720-p activated ERK1/2, CREB and p38MAPK in O4-positive cells, as well as in beta-III Tubulin positive neurons and GFAP positive astrocytes. In later cultures (day 6), FTY720-p activated p38MAPK in O4 positive cells, p38MAPK and ERK1/2 in neurons, and p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and CREB in astrocytes. A MEK inhibitor (U0126) prevented the differentiation of OPCs into O4-positive cells, while a p38MAPK inhibitor (PD169316) blocked progression into O4-positive and into GC-positive stages of differentiation. Our results demonstrate that FTY720-p, under conditions that model daily clinical use, can act directly on OPCs to impact differentiation, and also indirectly via neurons and astrocytes by activating ERK1/2 and p38MAPK.

Correlating Habenular Subnuclei in Rat and Mouse by Using Topographic, Morphological, and Cytochemical Criteria	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						lateral habenular complex (LHb); medial habenular complex (MHb); emotion; monaminergic systems; nonreward system; Kluver-Barrera stain	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; FOS-LIKE IMMUNOREACTIVITY; LATERAL HABENULA; DOPAMINE NEURONS; DIFFERENTIAL PROJECTIONS; NUCLEUS; REWARD; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COMPLEX; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE	The mammalian habenulae consist of medial (MHb) and lateral (LHb) nuclear complexes. Especially the LHb has received much interest because it has been recognized as the potential center of an "anti-reward system." Subnuclear organization and connectivity of the LHb are well known. In contrast, criteria to classify habenular neurons into distinct groups with potentially different biological functions are missing, most likely as a result of the lack of appropriate marker proteins. Actually, a huge amount of data concerning the localization of more than 20,000 mouse protein genes is provided in the Allen Brain Atlas. Unfortunately, the immediate use of this information is prohibited by the fact that the subnuclear organization of the habenular complexes in mouse is not known so far. The present report, therefore, uses topographic, structural, and cytochemical information from the rat to recognize corresponding areas within the mouse habenulae. Taking advantage of the fact that the Kluver-Barrera technique allows simultaneous observation of neuronal cell bodies and myelinated fibers, we were able to correlate subnuclear areas in the mouse habenula to subnuclei, which had been rigorously identified by several criteria in the rat. Our data suggest that the topographic localization of habenular subnuclei is rather similar between mouse and rat and that they may be homologous in these two species. Consequently, our data may allow using the Allen Brain Atlas as a source of basal information, which should be helpful to select candidate molecular markers for functionally different neurons in the mouse and potentially in higher mammalian species.

This study used 2-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy to measure capillary diameter, red blood cell speed, and flux in individual capillaries in the sensory-motor cortex of 12 adult (3-month-old) and 12 old (24-month-old) male Long-Evans rats under isoflurane anesthesia. The average (+/- standard deviation) diameter and speed over 921 capillaries were 6.4 +/- 1.4 mu m and 1.3 +/- 1.1 mm/s, respectively. Red blood cell speed and flux were significantly higher, by 48% and 15%, respectively, in old compared with young animals (p < 5%). The diameter also showed a similar tendency (7% higher, p = 5.7%). Furthermore, capillary hematocrit and density were significantly lower in the older group (p < 5%), by 32% and 20%, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Since adolescence represents a neurodevelopmental window that is extremely sensitive to the detrimental effects of drug abuse, we investigated the long-term behavioral and neurophysiological consequences of nandrolone abuse during adolescence. Adolescent rats received daily injections of nandrolone decanoate (15 mg/kg, i.m.) for 14 days (PND 40-53). At early adulthood (PND 68), forced swim, sucrose preference, open field and elevated plus maze tests were performed to assess behavioral changes. In vivo electrophysiological recordings were carried out to monitor changes in electrical activity of serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC). Our results show that after early exposure to nandrolone, rats display depression-related behavior, characterized by increased immobility in the forced swim test and reduced sucrose intake in the sucrose preference test. In addition, adult rats presented anxiety-like behavior characterized by decreased time and number of entries in the central zone of the open field and decreased time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Nandrolone decreased the firing rate of spontaneously active serotonergic neurons in the DRN while increasing the firing rate of noradrenergic neurons in the LC. These results provide evidence that nandrolone decanoate exposure during adolescence alters the emotional profile of animals in adulthood and significantly modifies both serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission.

The fMRI functional voice localizer (comprising a univariate analysis contrasting stimulation with vocal vs. non-vocal sounds) is known to give robust estimates of the temporal voice areas (TVAs). However, there is growing interest in employing multivariate analysis approaches to fMRI data (e.g., multivariate pattern analysis; MVPA). The aim of the current study was to localize voice-related areas in both female and male listeners and to investigate whether brain maps may differ depending on the gender of the listener. After a univariate analysis, a random effects analysis was performed on female (n = 149) and male (n = 123) listeners and contrasts between them were computed. In addition, MVPA with a whole-brain searchlight approach was implemented and classification maps were entered into a second-level permutation based random effects models using statistical non-parametric mapping (SnPM; Nichols and Holmes; 2 0 02). Gender differences were found only in the MVPA. Identified regions were located in the middle part of the middle temporal gyrus (bilateral) and the middle superior temporal gyrus (right hemisphere). Our results suggest differences in classifier performance between genders in response to the voice localizer with higher classification accuracy from local BOLD signal patterns in several temporal-lobe regions in female listeners.

Loss of alpha-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (alpha CGRP) Reduces the Efficacy of the Vestibulo-ocular Reflex (VOR)	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						CGRP; efferent; mouse; sensory coding; vestibular; vestibuloocular reflex	EFFERENT VESTIBULAR SYSTEM; HAIR-CELLS; UNILATERAL LABYRINTHECTOMY; NERVE AFFERENTS; DEFICIENT MICE; MOUSE; RECEPTOR; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; COLOCALIZATION; INNERVATION	The neuroactive peptide calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) is known to act at efferent synapses and their targets in hair cell organs, including the cochlea and lateral line. CGRP is also expressed in vestibular efferent neurons as well as a number of central vestibular neurons. Although CGRP-null (-/-) mice demonstrate a significant reduction in cochlear nerve sound-evoked activity compared with wild-type mice, it is unknown whether and how the loss of CGRP influence vestibular system function. Vestibular function was assessed by quantifying the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in alert mice. The loss of CGRP in (-/-) mice was associated with a reduction of the VOR gain of approximate to 50% without a concomitant change in phase. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that, although CGRP staining was absent in the vestibular end-organs of null (-/-) mice, cholinergic staining appeared normal, suggesting that the overall gross development of vestibular efferent innervation was unaltered. We further confirmed that the observed deficit in vestibular function of null (-/-) mice was not the result of nontargeted effects at the level of the extraocular motor neurons and/or their innervation of extraocular muscles. Analysis of the relationship between vestibular quick phase amplitude and peak velocity revealed that extraocular motor function was unchanged, and immunohistochemistry revealed no abnormalities in motor endplates. Together, our findings show that the neurotransmitter CGRP plays a key role in ensuring VOR efficacy.

From dinosaurs to birds: a tail of evolution	EVODEVO			English	Review						Archaeopteryx; Avian; Bird evolution; Confuciusornis; Dinosaur; Jeholornis; Sapeornis; Somitogenesis; Tail	VENTRAL ECTODERMAL RIDGE; SOMITE SEGMENTATION CLOCK; HOX GENE-EXPRESSION; DORSAL NEURAL-TUBE; RETINOIC ACID; MOUSE EMBRYO; SONIC-HEDGEHOG; AVIAN TAIL; AXIAL ELONGATION; VERTEBRATE SEGMENTATION	A particularly critical event in avian evolution was the transition from long- to short-tailed birds. Primitive bird tails underwent significant alteration, most notably reduction of the number of caudal vertebrae and fusion of the distal caudal vertebrae into an ossified pygostyle. These changes, among others, occurred over a very short evolutionary interval, which brings into focus the underlying mechanisms behind those changes. Despite the wealth of studies delving into avian evolution, virtually nothing is understood about the genetic and developmental events responsible for the emergence of short, fused tails. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the signaling pathways and morphological events that contribute to tail extension and termination and examine how mutations affecting the genes that control these pathways might influence the evolution of the avian tail. To generate a list of candidate genes that may have been modulated in the transition to short-tailed birds, we analyzed a comprehensive set of mouse mutants. Interestingly, a prevalent pleiotropic effect of mutations that cause fused caudal vertebral bodies (as in the pygostyles of birds) is tail truncation. We identified 23 mutations in this class, and these were primarily restricted to genes involved in axial extension. At least half of the mutations that cause short, fused tails lie in the Notch/Wnt pathway of somite boundary formation or differentiation, leading to changes in somite number or size. Several of the mutations also cause additional bone fusions in the trunk skeleton, reminiscent of those observed in primitive and modern birds. All of our findings were correlated to the fossil record. An open question is whether the relatively sudden appearance of short-tailed birds in the fossil record could be accounted for, at least in part, by the pleiotropic effects generated by a relatively small number of mutational events.

The mechanism involves their binding to iron responsive elements (IREs) in the untranslated regions of target mRNAs, thereby controlling mRNA translation or stability. Whereas IRP2 functions solely as an RNA-binding protein, IRP1 operates as either an RNA-binding protein or a cytosolic aconitase. Early experiments in cultured cells established a crucial role of IRPs in regulation of cellular iron metabolism. More recently, studies in mouse models with global or localized Irp1 and/or Irp2 deficiencies uncovered new physiological functions of IRPs in the context of systemic iron homeostasis. Thus, IRP1 emerged as a key regulator of erythropoiesis and iron absorption by controlling hypoxia inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2 alpha) mRNA translation, while IRP2 appears to dominate the control of iron uptake and heme biosynthesis in erythroid progenitor cells by regulating the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 (ALAS2) mRNAs, respectively. Targeted disruption of either Irp1 or Irp2 in mice is associated with distinct phenotypic abnormalities. Thus, Irp1(-/-) mice develop polycythemia and pulmonary hypertension, while Irp2(-/-) mice present with microcytic anemia, iron overload in the intestine and the liver, and neurologic defects. Combined disruption of both Irp1 and Irp2 is incombatible with life and leads to early embryonic lethality. Mice with intestinal- or liver-specific disruption of both lrps are viable at birth but die later on due to malabsorption or liver failure, respectively. Adult mice lacking both lrps in the intestine exhibit a profound defect in dietary iron absorption due to a "mucosal block" that is caused by the de-repression of ferritin mRNA translation. Herein, we discuss the physiological function of the IRE/IRP regulatory system.

In biological agents, OC results in behavioral changes learned from the consequences of previous actions, based on progressive prediction adjustment from rewarding or punishing signals. In a neurorobotics context, virtual and physical autonomous robots may benefit from a similar learning skill when facing unknown and unsupervised environments. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple invariant micro-circuit can sustain OC in multiple learning scenarios. The motivation for this new OC implementation model stems from the relatively complex alternatives that have been described in the computational literature and recent advances in neurobiology. Our elementary kernel includes only a few crucial neurons, synaptic links and originally from the integration of habituation and spike-timing dependent plasticity as learning rules. Using several tasks of incremental complexity, our results show that a minimal neural component set is sufficient to realize many OC procedures. Hence, with the proposed OC module, designing learning tasks with an ASNN and a bio-inspired robot context leads to simpler neural architectures for achieving complex behaviors.

Multiple Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) are implicated in maintenance of neural pH homeostasis. However, aside from the ubiquitous NHE1 isoform, their relative contributions are poorly understood. NHE5 is of particular interest as it is preferentially expressed in brain relative to other tissues. In hippocampal neurons, NHE5 regulates steady-state cytoplasmic pH, but intriguingly the bulk of the transporter is stored in intracellular vesicles. Here, we show that NHE5 is a direct target for phosphorylation by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key sensor and regulator of cellular energy homeostasis in response to metabolic stresses. In NHE5-transfected non-neuronal cells, activation of AMPK by the AMP mimetic AICAR or by antimycin A, which blocks aerobic respiration and causes acidification, increased cell surface accumulation and activity of NHE5, and elevated intracellular pH. These effects were effectively blocked by the AMPK antagonist compound C, the NHE inhibitor HOE694, and mutation of a predicted AMPK recognition motif in the NHE5 C terminus. This regulatory pathway was also functional in primary hippocampal neurons, where AMPK activation of NHE5 protected the cells from sustained antimycin A-induced acidification. These data reveal a unique role for AMPK and NHE5 in regulating the pH homeostasis of hippocampal neurons during metabolic stress.

Cell-Specific Retrograde Signals Mediate Antiparallel Effects of Angiotensin II on Osmoreceptor Afferents to Vasopressin and Oxytocin Neurons	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							HYPOTHALAMIC SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEUS; NITRIC-OXIDE; MAGNOCELLULAR-NEURONS; RELEASE; RATS; HYPOVOLEMIA; GLUTAMATE; ENDOCANNABINOIDS; OSMOREGULATION; TRANSMISSION	Homeostatic control of extracellular fluid osmolality in rats requires a parallel excitation of vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) neurosecretory neurons by osmoreceptor afferents to regulate the amount of water and sodium in the urine under normal conditions. However, during decreased blood volume (hypovolemia), natriuresis is suppressed, whereas osmotically driven antidiuresis is enhanced to promote retention of isotonic fluid. Because Angiotensin II (Ang II) is released centrally to indicate hypovolemia, we hypothesized that Ang II can evoke a state-dependent switch in circuit function. Here, we show that Ang II, a neuropeptide released centrally during hypovolemia, suppresses osmoreceptor-mediated synaptic excitation of OT neurons while potentiating excitation of VP neurons. Ang II does this by inducing cell-autonomous release of nitric oxide by VP neurons and endocannabinoids by OT neurons to respectively enhance and reduce glutamate release by osmoreceptor afferents. These findings indicate that peptide modulators such as Ang II can regulate synaptic communication to achieve a state-dependent and target-specific modulation of circuit activity.

Insulin signaling in the aging of healthy and proteotoxically stressed mechanosensory neurons	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS			English	Article								Insulin signaling is central to cellular metabolism and organismal aging. However, the role of insulin signaling in natural and proteotoxically stressed aging neurons has yet to be fully described. We studied aging of Caenorbaditis elegans mechanosensory neurons expressing a neurotoxic expanded polyglutamine transgene (polyQ128), or lacking this proteotoxicity stressor (polyQ0), under conditions in which the insulin signaling pathway was disrupted by RNA interference (RNAi). We describe specific changes in lifespan, mechanosensory neuronal morphologies, and mechansensory function following RNAi treatment targeting the insulin signaling pathway. Overall, we confirmed that transcription factor DAF-16 is neuroprotective in the proteotoxically stressed model, though not strikingly in the naturally aging model. Decreased insulin signaling through daf-2 RNAi improved mechanosensory function in both models and decreased protein aggregation load in polyQ128, yet showed opposing effects on accumulation of neuronal aberrations in both strains. Decreased daf-2 signaling slightly enhanced mechanosensation while greatly enhancing branching of the mechanosensory neuron axons and dendrites in polyQ0 animals, suggesting that branching is an adaptive response in natural aging. These effects in polyQ0 did not appear to involve DAF-16, suggesting the existence of a non-canonical DAF-2 pathway for the modulation of morphological adaptation. However, in polyQ128 animals, decreased daf-2 signaling significantly enhanced mechanosensation while decreasing neuronal aberrations. Unlike other interventions that reduce the strength of insulin signaling, daf-2 RNAi dramatically redistributed large polyQ128 aggregates to the cell body, away from neuronal processes. Our results suggest that insulin signaling strength can differentially affect specific neurons aging naturally or under proteotoxic stress	[Scerbak, Courtney; Vayndorf, Elena M.; Taylor, Barbara E.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Scerbak, Courtney; Taylor, Barbara E.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Biol & Wildlife, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Parker, J.

Joint estimation of states and parameters of Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal model using Kalman filtering	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						HH neuronal model; Dynamical system; Kalman Filtering; Parameter estimation	ANALOG INTEGRATED-CIRCUITS; VOLTAGE RECORDINGS; DYNAMIC CLAMP; ALGORITHM	Fitting biophysical models to real noisy data jointly with extracting fundamental biophysical parameters has recently stimulated tremendous studies in computational neuroscience. Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuronal model has been considered as the most detailed biophysical model for representing the dynamical behavior of the spiking neurons. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has been already applied to track the dynamics of the HH model. In this paper, we extend the existing Kalman filtering (KF) technique for the HH model to another version, namely, extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Two estimation strategies of the KF, dual and joint estimation strategies, are derived for simultaneously tracking the hidden dynamics and estimating the unknown parameters of a single neuron, leading to four KF algorithms, namely, joint UKF (JUKF), dual UKF (DUKF), joint EKF (JEKF) and dual EKF (DEKF). Detailed derivations of these four methods and intensive simulation studies are provided. Our main contribution is in the derivation of the EKF-based methods, JEKF and DEKF, for tracking the states and estimating the parameters of the HH neuronal model. Since these EKF-based methods are faster than UKF-based versions, they can particularly be employed in dynamic clamp technique, which connects artificial and biological neurons in order to assess the function of neuronal circuits.

Here, we show that A beta peptides varying in lengths from 38 to 43 amino acids are internalized by cultured neuroblastoma cells and can be found in the nucleus. By three independent methods, we demonstrate direct detection of nuclear A beta 42 as follows: (i) biochemical analysis of nuclear fractions; (ii) detection of biotin-labeled A beta in living cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy; and (iii) transmission electron microscopy of A beta in cultured cells, as well as brain tissue of wild-type and transgenic APPPS1 mice (overexpression of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 with Swedish and L166P mutations, respectively). Also, this study details a novel role for A beta 42 in nuclear signaling, distinct from the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that A beta 42 specifically interacts as a repressor of gene transcription with LRP1 and KAI1 promoters. By quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed that mRNA levels of the examined candidate genes were exclusively decreased by the potentially neurotoxic A beta 42 wild-type peptide. Shorter peptides (A beta 38 or A beta 40) and other longer peptides (nontoxic A beta 42 G33A substitution or A beta 43) did not affect mRNA levels. Overall, our data indicate that the nuclear translocation of A beta 42 impacts gene regulation, and deleterious effects of A beta 42 in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis may be influenced by altering the expression profiles of disease-modifying genes.

Lactate Storm Marks Cerebral Metabolism following Brain Trauma	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRICARBOXYLIC-ACID CYCLE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; C-13 NMR; IN-VIVO; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; SUBSTRATE DELIVERY; GLUTAMATE UPTAKE; INJURY; ASTROCYTES	Brain metabolism is thought to be maintained by neuronalglial metabolic coupling. Glia take up glutamate from the synaptic cleft for conversion into glutamine, triggering glial glycolysis and lactate production. This lactate is shuttled into neurons and further metabolized. The origin and role of lactate in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains controversial. Using a modified weight drop model of severe TBI and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy with infusion of C-13-labeled glucose, lactate, and acetate, the present study investigated the possibility that neuronal-glial metabolism is uncoupled following severe TBI. Histopathology of the model showed severe brain injury with subarachnoid and hemorrhage together with glial cell activation and positive staining for Tau at 90 min post-trauma. High resolution MR spectroscopy of brain metabolites revealed significant labeling of lactate at C-3 and C-2 irrespective of the infused substrates. Increased C-13-labeled lactate in all study groups in the absence of ischemia implied activated astrocytic glycolysis and production of lactate with failure of neuronal uptake (i.e. a loss of glial sensing for glutamate). The early increase in extracellular lactate in severe TBI with the injured neurons rendered unable to pick it up probably contributes to a rapid progression toward irreversible injury and pan-necrosis. Hence, a method to detect and scavenge the excess extracellular lactate on site or early following severe TBI may be a potential primary therapeutic measure.

APC Is an RNA-Binding Protein, and Its Interactome Provides a Link to Neural Development and Microtubule Assembly	CELL			English	Article							TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR PROTEIN; POLYPOSIS-COLI PROTEIN; CANONICAL WNT PATHWAY; BETA-TUBULIN; CELL-MIGRATION; MESSENGER-RNAS; GENE; CYTOSKELETON; TRANSLATION; GROWTH	Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a microtubule plus-end scaffolding protein important in biology and disease. APC is implicated in RNA localization, although the mechanisms and functional significance remain unclear. We show APC is an RNA-binding protein and identify an RNA interactome by HITS-CLIP. Targets were highly enriched for APC-related functions, including microtubule organization, cell motility, cancer, and neurologic disease. Among the targets is beta 2B-tubulin, known to be required in human neuron and axon migration. We show beta 2B-tubulin is synthesized in axons and localizes preferentially to dynamic microtubules in the growth cone periphery. APC binds the beta 2B-tubulin 3' UTR; experiments interfering with this interaction reduced beta 2B-tubulin mRNA axonal localization and expression, depleted dynamic microtubules and the growth cone periphery, and impaired neuron migration. These results identify APC as a platform binding functionally related protein and RNA networks, and suggest a self-organizing model for the microtubule to localize synthesis of its own subunits.

In the present study, we confirmed that under physiological conditions, one tau-positive band was detected in the culture medium with an anti-tau antibody recognizing total tau and the Tau-1 antibody directed against unphosphorylated tau. We then examined whether tau secretion was modified upon insults. Tau secretion was increased by starvation [Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS)], inhibition of lysosomal function (leupeptin) and when both of these conditions were superimposed, this combined treatment having the most important effects on tau secretion. Interestingly, the pattern of tau secretion was distinct from that of control neurons when neurons were treated either with EBSS alone or EBSS + leupeptin. In these conditions, three tau-positive bands were detected in the culture medium. Two of these three bands were immunoreactive to Tau-1 antibody revealing that at least two tau species were released upon these treatments. Collectively, our results indicate that insults such as nutrient deprivation and lysosomal dysfunction observed in neurodegenerative diseases could result in an increase of tau secretion and propagation of tau pathology in the brain.

Spinal locomotor circuits produce a series of behaviors during development before locomotion that reflect the continual integration of spinal neurons into a functional network, but how the circuitry is reconfigured is not understood. The first behavior of the zebrafish embryo (spontaneous coiling) is mediated by an electrical circuit that subsequently generates mature locomotion (swimming) as chemical neurotransmission develops. We describe here a new spontaneous behavior, double coiling, that consists of two alternating contractions of the tail in rapid succession. Double coiling was glutamate-dependent and required descending hindbrain excitation, similar to but preceding swimming, making it a discrete intermediary developmental behavior. At the cellular level, motoneurons had a distinctive glutamate-dependent activity pattern that correlated with double coiling. Two glutamatergic interneurons, CoPAs and CiDs, had different activity profiles during this novel behavior. CoPA neurons failed to show changes in activity patterns during the period in which double coiling appears, whereas CiD neurons developed a glutamate-dependent activity pattern that correlated with double coiling and they innervated motoneurons at that time. Additionally, double coils were modified after pharmacological reduction of glycinergic neurotransmission such that embryos produced three or more rapidly alternating coils. We propose that double coiling behavior represents an important transition of the motor network from an electrically coupled spinal cord circuit that produces simple periodic coils to a spinal network driven by descending chemical neurotransmission, which generates more complex behaviors.

Netrin-1 and its receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) are proteins enriched at paranodes that are expressed by neurons and oligodendrocytes. To identify the specific function of DCC expressed by oligodendrocytes in vivo, we selectively eliminated DCC from mature myelinating oligodendrocytes using an inducible cre regulated by the proteolipid protein promoter. We demonstrate that DCC deletion results in progressive disruption of the organization of axonal domains, myelin ultrastructure, and myelin protein composition. Conditional DCC knock-out mice develop balance and coordination deficits and exhibit decreased conduction velocity. We conclude that DCC expression by oligodendrocytes is required for the maintenance and stability of myelin in vivo, which is essential for proper signal conduction in the CNS.

J	Zeidman, LA; Ziller, MG; Shevell, M				Zeidman, Lawrence A.; Ziller, Matthias Georg; Shevell, Michael			Gerstmann, Straussler, and Scheinker The persecution of the men behind the syndrome	NEUROLOGY			English	Article								In 1936, Austrian neuroscientists Josef Gerstmann and Ernst Straussler, along with expatriate Russian neuroscientist Ilya Mark Scheinker, described the familial prion disorder later named for them from a case they mutually treated at a Viennese neurologic hospital. In 1938, Austria was annexed to Nazi Germany in the Anschluss, effectively ending any collaboration between the 3 men. Gerstmann and Scheinker eventually immigrated to America, and Straussler, although dismissed from his faculty position, remained protected from persecution in Vienna throughout the war likely because of his marriage to an "Aryan woman." Although he attained some degree of success in exile, Gerstmann was never again director of a hospital and primarily maintained a private practice after some brief consulting positions in New York in the 1940s. His medical degree was retroactively stripped by the Nazis without his knowledge, and was not reinstated until 1955. Gerstmann also became embroiled in a bitter struggle to regain his confiscated property in Vienna. Scheinker, aided by the refugee resettlement committee, settled in Cincinnati where he had several successful years and published 3 textbooks, but was denied university tenure and entered private practice until his untimely death. All 3 neurologists lost significant career momentum, and had to pick up the pieces of their fractured lives after the war or their forced exile. Their stories reflect many of the tragic realities of Nazi persecution of Jewish physicians.

The incidence of microsporidiosis has decreased with the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy but it is frequently reported in non-HIV immunosuppressed patients and as a latent infection in immunocompetent individuals. Herein, we describe an HIV-infected male (46 years) with suspected progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy that has not responded to optimal antiretroviral therapy, steroids, or cidofovir. Post-mortem examination revealed cerebral microsporidiosis. No diagnostic clue however, was found when the patient was alive. This report underscores the need for physicians to consider microsporidiosis (potentially affecting the brain) when no other etiology is established both in HIV, non-HIV immunosuppressed patients and in immunocompetent individuals.

Spines compartmentalize calcium, and this biochemical isolation can underlie input-specific synaptic plasticity, providing a raison d'etre for spines. However, recent results indicate that the spine can experience a membrane potential different from that in the parent dendrite, as though the spine neck electrically isolated the spine. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging of mouse neocortical pyramidal neurons to analyze the correlation between the morphologies of spines activated under minimal synaptic stimulation and the excitatory postsynaptic potentials they generate. We find that excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes are inversely correlated with spine neck lengths. Furthermore, a spike timing-dependent plasticity protocol, in which two-photon glutamate uncaging over a spine is paired with postsynaptic spikes, produces rapid shrinkage of the spine neck and concomitant increases in the amplitude of the evoked spine potentials. Using numerical simulations, we explore the parameter regimes for the spine neck resistance and synaptic conductance changes necessary to explain our observations. Our data, directly correlating synaptic and morphological plasticity, imply that long-necked spines have small or negligible somatic voltage contributions, but that, upon synaptic stimulation paired with postsynaptic activity, they can shorten their necks and increase synaptic efficacy, thus changing the input/output gain of pyramidal neurons.

MTRR (methionine synthase reductase) activates methionine synthase, which catalyses homocysteine remethylation to methionine. Severe MTRR deficiency results in homocystinuria with cognitive and motor impairments. An MTRR polymorphism may influence homocysteine levels and reproductive outcomes. The goal of the present study was to determine whether mild hyperhomocysteinaemia affects neurological function in a mouse model with Mtrr deficiency. Mtrr(+/+), Mtrr(+/gt) and Mtrr(gt/gt) mice (3 months old) were assessed for short-term memory, brain volumes and hippocampal morphology. We also measured DNA methylation, apoptosis, neurogenesis, choline metabolites and expression of ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) and AChE (acetylcholinesterase) in the hippocampus. Mtrr(gt/gt) mice exhibited short-term memory impairment on two tasks. They had global DNA hypomethylation and decreased choline, betaine and acetylcholine levels. Expression of ChAT and AChE was increased and decreased respectively. At 3 weeks of age, they showed increased neurogenesis. In the cerebellum, mutant mice had DNA hypomethylation, decreased choline and increased expression of ChAT. Our work demonstrates that mild hyperhomocysteinaemia is associated with memory impairment. We propose a mechanism whereby a deficiency in methionine synthesis leads to hypomethylation and compensatory disturbances in choline metabolism in the hippocampus. This disturbance affects the levels of acetylcholine, a critical neurotransmitter in learning and memory.

Animals with a schizophrenia-like phenotype are differentially sensitive to the motivational effects of cannabinoid agonists in conditioned place preference	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Amphetamine; Cannabinoid; Conditioned place preference; Neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion; Schizophrenia	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; INTRACRANIAL SELF-STIMULATION; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPAL-LESIONS; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; GLUTAMATE RELEASE; DOPAMINE NEURONS; TEGMENTAL AREA; RATS	Cannabis is the most consumed illicit drug worldwide, but among patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, this consumption is higher suggesting that they are differentially sensitive to cannabis. We chose to study this problematic using a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia: neonatal ventral hippocampus lesions (NVHL). In a first study, we compared the locomotor response to novelty, a mild stress and two doses of amphetamine (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) in sham and NVHL rats at post-natal day 35 (PD35) or 56 (PD56). In a second study, we investigated the valence of the motivational effect of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinnol (THC, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and the cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN55,212-2 (WIN, 1 mg/kg, i.p.), using the conditioned place preference paradigm; we used a biased procedure that comprised 12 days of testing with 3 paired-conditioning. The effects of this dose of WIN were also measured on locomotor activity. Results confirmed that the adult NVHL animals displayed a stronger locomotor response to the two doses of amphetamine, but not to novelty and a mild stress. In adult NVHL, but not sham animals, WIN stimulated locomotor activity and produced a conditioned place aversion. At the dose tested, THC tended to produce an aversion in adult sham but not NVHL animals. Taken together these findings show that adult animals with a schizophrenia-like phenotype are differentially sensitive to the motivational effect of cannabinoids. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is renewed interest in the role of the cerebellum in non-motor functions such as cognition and in the context of different neuropsychiatric disorders. The contribution of neuroimaging studies to advancing understanding of cerebellar structure and function has been limited, partly due to the cerebellum being understudied as a result of contrast and resolution limitations of standard structural magnetic resonance images (MRI). These limitations inhibit proper visualization of the highly compact and detailed cerebellar foliations. In addition, there is a lack of robust algorithms that automatically and reliably identify the cerebellum and its subregions, further complicating the design of large-scale studies of the cerebellum. As such, automated segmentation of the cerebellar lobules would allow detailed population studies of the cerebellum and its subregions. In this manuscript, we describe a novel set of high-resolution in vivo atlases of the cerebellum developed by pairing MR imaging with a carefully validated manual segmentation protocol. Using these cerebellar atlases as inputs, we validate a novel automated segmentation algorithm that takes advantage of the neuroanatomical variability that exists in a given population under study in order to automatically identify the cerebellum, and its lobules. Our automatic segmentation results demonstrate good accuracy in the identification of all lobules (mean Kappa [kappa] = 0.731; range 0.40-0.89), and the entire cerebellum (means kappa = 0.925; range 0.90-0.94) when compared to "gold-standard" manual segmentations. These results compare favorably in comparison to other publically available methods for automatic segmentation of the cerebellum. The completed cerebellar atlases are available freely online (http://imaging-genetics.camh.ca/cerebellum) and can be customized to the unique neuroanatomy of different subjects using the proposed segmentation pipeline (https://github.com/pipitone/MAGeTbrain).

The two recruitment sources are the 10-year follow-up cohort of the German Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) Study, and the HNR MultiGeneration Study cohort, which comprises spouses and offspring of HNR subjects. The HNR is a longitudinal epidemiological investigation of cardiovascular risk factors, with a comprehensive collection of clinical, laboratory, socioeconomic, and environmental data from population-based subjects aged 45-75 years on inclusion. HNR subjects underwent detailed assessments in 2000, 2006, and 2011, and completed annual postal questionnaires on health status. 1000BRAINS accesses these HNR data and applies a separate protocol comprising: neuropsychological tests of attention, memory, executive functions and language; examination of motor skills; ratings of personality, life quality, mood and daily activities; analysis of laboratory and genetic data; and state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, 3 Tesla) of the brain. The latter includes (i) 3D-T1- and 3D-T2-weighted scans for structural analyses and myelin mapping; (ii) three diffusion imaging sequences optimized for diffusion tensor imaging, high-angular resolution diffusion imaging for detailed fiber tracking and for diffusion kurtosis imaging; (iii) resting-state and task-based functional MRI; and (iv) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and MR angiography for the detection of vascular lesions and the mapping of white matter lesions. The unique design of 1000BRAINS allows: (i) comprehensive investigation of various influences including genetics, environment and health status on variability in brain structure and function during aging; and (ii) identification of the impact of selected influencing factors on specific cognitive subsystems and their anatomical correlates.

Reconstructions are typically created using Neurolucida after biocytin histology (BH). An alternative inexpensive and fast method is to use freeware such as Neuromantic to reconstruct from fluorescence imaging (El) stacks acquired using 2-photon laser-scanning microscopy during physiological recording. We compare these two methods with respect to morphometry, cell classification, and multicompartmental modeling in the NEURON simulation environment. Quantitative morphological analysis of the same cells reconstructed using both methods reveals that whilst biocytin reconstructions facilitate tracing of more distal collaterals, both methods are comparable in representing the overall morphology: automated clustering of reconstructions from both methods successfully separates neocortical basket cells from pyramidal cells but not BH from Fl reconstructions. BH reconstructions suffer more from tissue shrinkage and compression artifacts than Fl reconstructions do. Fl reconstructions, on the other hand, consistently have larger process diameters. Consequently, significant differences in NEURON modeling of excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) forward propagation are seen between the two methods, with Fl reconstructions exhibiting smaller depolarizations. Simulated action potential backpropagation (bAP), however, is indistinguishable between reconstructions obtained with the two methods. In our hands, BH reconstructions are necessary for NEURON modeling and detailed morphological tracing, and thus remain state of the art, although they are more labor intensive, more expensive, and suffer from a higher failure rate due to the occasional poor outcome of histological processing. However, for a subset of anatomical applications such as cell type identification, Fl reconstructions are superior, because of indistinguishable classification performance with greater ease of use, essentially 100% success rate, and lower cost.

We previously reported that divalent metal ions dictate the conformation of the extracellular APP E2 domain (Dahms, S. O., Konnig, I., Roeser, D., G hrs, K.-H., Mayer, M. C., Kaden, D., Multhaup, G., and Than, M. E. (2012) J. Mol. Biol. 416, 438-452), but unresolved is the nature and functional importance of metal ion binding to APLP1 and APLP2. We found here that zinc ions bound to APP and APLP1 E2 domains and mediated their oligomerization, whereas the APLP2 E2 domain interacted more weakly with zinc possessing a less surface-exposed zinc-binding site, and stayed monomeric. Copper ions bound to E2 domains of all three proteins. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses examined the effect of metal ion binding to APP and APLPs in the cellular context in real time. Zinc ions specifically induced APP and APLP1 oligomerization and forced APLP1 into multimeric clusters at the plasma membrane consistent with zinc concentrations in the blood and brain. The observed effects were mediated by a novel zinc-binding site within the APLP1 E2 domain as APLP1 deletion mutants revealed. Based upon its cellular localization and its dominant response to zinc ions, APLP1 is mainly affected by extracellular zinc among the APP family proteins. We conclude that zinc binding and APP/APLP oligomerization are intimately linked, and we propose that this represents a novel mechanism for regulating APP/APLP protein function at the molecular level.

We have previously shown that variations in the function of the netrin-1 receptor, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), result in changes to the development, organization and ongoing plasticity of DA circuitry. In rodents, repeated exposure to the indirect DA-agonist, amphetamine upregulates DCC expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not in DA terminal regions. This elevation in DCC expression is associated with increased vulnerability to developing and maintaining sensitized mesolimbic DA function. Antipsychotic medications remain the best treatment option for managing the symptoms in schizophrenia. The peak effects of these medications are gradual, suggesting that a therapeutic component of antipsychotic treatment involves structural reorganization. Here we assessed whether repeated exposure to typical and atypical antipsychotics could also regulate DCC. Adult mice were orally administered haloperidol, clozapine, or risperidone via their drinking water for 4 weeks. Levels of DCC were measured by Western blot analysis of tissue punches of the VTA, medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum. Haloperidol decreased DCC levels by approximately 50% in the VTA, but not in DA targets. Furthermore, haloperidol did not alter UNC-5 homologue levels, another family of netrin-1 receptors, confirming that its effects target DCC-mediated netrin-1 signaling specifically. The atypical antipsychotics did not alter DCC expression. These results suggest that typical antipsychotics induce selective functional reorganization in the VTA via DCC-mediated netrin-1 signaling.

Bisphosphonates suffer from poor "drug-like" properties and are mainly effective in treating skeletal diseases. Recent investigations have implicated hFPPS in various nonskeletal diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Analysis of single nudeotide polymorphisms in the hFPPS gene and mRNA levels in autopsy-confirmed AD subjects was undertaken, and a genetic link between hFPPS and phosphorylated tau (P-Tau) levels in the human brain was identified. Elevated P-Tau levels are strongly implicated in AD progression. The development of nonbisphosphonate inhibitors can provide molecular tools for validating hFPPS as a therapeutic target for tauopathy-associated neurodegeneration. A multistage screening protocol led to the identification of a new monophosphonate chemotype that bind in an allosteric pocket of hFPPS. Optimization of these compounds could lead to human therapeutics that block tau metabolism and arrest the progression of neurodegeneration.

The first is frequently detected in the adrenal gland and the second develops in the kidneys. The extension through the vena cava and the lung metastases are frequent in Wilms' tumors and are rarely seen in neuroblastoma. We present the cases of three children with abdominal tumors with thrombus in the inferior vena cava and pulmonary metastases demonstrating a stage 4 neuroblastoma. The three male patients were between 23 to 48 months old. They presented an abdominal mass, near the superior pole of the kidney. Thrombus of the vena cava was showed on imaging studies in all cases and pulmonary metastases were always found. Catecholamine metabolites were present in the first case and negative in the two others. Two out of three patients had a radical nephrectomy. The pathological analysis always found a poorly differentiated or undifferentiated neuroblastoma without MYCN amplification and confirmed the vein tumoral thrombus in the second case. The evolution of the first two patients was unfavorable and the third is alive. Invasion of the inferior vena cava and pulmonary metastases in children with neuroblastoma is uncommon and can modify the surgical management.

However, how aging affects different stages along the visual pathway is unclear. In the current study, the contrast response function, one of the most important properties of neurons from early visual areas to high brain areas, was systematically compared along the visual pathway, including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), early visual cortices (A17 and A18), and posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex (PMLS, analog to the medial temporal area (MT) in monkeys) of young and old cats. We found that the effects of aging on the LGN were negligible, whereas those in the striate cortex were substantial, with even more severe degradation in the PMLS. Reduced contrast sensitivity of neurons in the three cortical areas was accompanied by enhanced maximal visual response, increased spontaneous activity, and decreased signal-to-noise ratio, while LGN neurons exhibited largely normal response properties. Our results suggested that there was a progressively greater effect of aging on neurons at successively higher stages in the visual pathway.

PD patients show motor and cognitive dysfunction with specific impairments in the internal generation of motor actions and executive deficits, respectively. The role of the BG, then, would be to integrate information from several sources in order to make a decision on a resulting action adequate for the required task. Reanalyzing the data set from our previous study (Martinu et al., 2012), we investigated this hypothesis by applying a graph theory method to a series of fMRI data during the performance of self-initiated (SI) finger movement tasks obtained in healthy volunteers (HV) and early stage PD patients. Dorsally, connectivity strength between the medial prefrontal areas (mPFC) and cortical regions including the primary motor area (M1), the extrastriate visual cortex, and the associative cortex, was reduced in the PD patients. The connectivity strengths were positively correlated to activity in the striatum in both groups. Ventrally, all connectivity between the striatum, the thalamus, and the extrastriate visual cortex decreased in strength in the PD, as did the connectivity between the striatum and the ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC). Individual response time (RT) was negatively correlated to connectivity strength between the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and the striatum and positively correlated to connectivity between the VLPFC and the striatum in the HV. These results indicate that the BG, with the mPFC and thalamus, are involved in integrating multiple sources of information from areas such as DLPFC, and VLPFC, connecting to M1, thereby determining a network that leads to the adequate decision and performance of the resulting action.

To that end, a computerized battery of nine neuromuscular tests has been designed and evaluated with a sample of 120 subjects with or without stoke risk factors. The kinematics of the movements produced was analyzed using a computational neuromuscular model and predictive characteristics were extracted. Logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation was used to infer the probability of presence of brain stroke risk factors. The clinical potential value of movement information for stroke prevention was assessed by computing area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the diagnostic of risk factors based on motion analysis. AUC mostly varying between 0.6 and 0.9 were obtained, depending on the neuromuscular test and the risk factor investigated (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, and cardiac disease). Our results support the feasibility of the proposed methodology and its potential application for the development of brain stroke prevention tools. Although further research is needed to improve this methodology and its outcome, results are promising and the proposed approach should be of great interest for many experimenters open to novel approaches in preventive medicine and in gerontology. It should also be valuable for engineers, psychologists, and researchers using human movements for the development of diagnostic and neuromuscular assessment tools.

In addition to A beta pathology, various lines of research have implicated neuroinflammation as an important participant in AD pathophysiology. Currently, neuroinflammation can be measured in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) with ligands targeting diverse biological processes such as microglial activation, reactive astrocytes and phospholipase A beta activity. In terms of therapeutic strategies, despite a strong rationale and epidemiological studies suggesting that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce the prevalence of AD, clinical trials conducted to date have proven inconclusive. In this respect, it has been hypothesized that NSAIDs may only prove protective if administered early on in the disease course, prior to the accumulation of significant AD pathology. In order to test various hypotheses pertaining to the exact role of neuroinflammation in AD, studies in asymptomatic carriers of mutations deterministic for early-onset familial AD may prove of use. In this respect, PET ligands for neuroinflammation may act as surrogate markers of disease progression, allowing for the development of more integrative models of AD, as well as for the measuring of target engagement in the context of clinical trials using NSAIDs. In this review, we address the biological basis of neuroinflammatory changes in AD, underscore therapeutic strategies using anti-inflammatory compounds, and shed light on the possibility of tracking neuroinflammation in vivo using PET imaging ligands.

They produce their analgesic actions by specifically activating opioid receptors located along the pain perception pathway where they inhibit the flow of nociceptive information. This inhibition is partly accomplished by activation of hyperpolarizing G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK or Kir3) channels. Kir3 channels control cellular excitability in the central nervous system and in the heart and, because of their ubiquitous distribution, they mediate the effects of a large range of hormones and neurotransmitters which, upon activation of corresponding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) lead to channel opening. Here we analyze GPCR signaling via these effectors in reference to precoupling and collision models. Existing knowledge on signaling bias is discussed in relation to these models as a means of developing strategies to produce novel opioid analgesics with an improved side effects profile.

Our research found that one in seven school children with mild traumatic brain injury suffer post-concussion syndrome symptoms for three months or longer. Post-concussion syndrome is associated with significant disability in the child and his/her family and yet there are no evidence-based medical treatments available. Melatonin has several potential mechanisms of action that could be useful following mild traumatic brain injury, including neuroprotective effects. The aim of this study is to determine if treatment with melatonin improves post-concussion syndrome in youths following mild traumatic brain injury. Our hypothesis is that treatment of post-concussion syndrome following mild traumatic brain injury with 3 or 10 mg of sublingual melatonin for 28 days will result in a decrease in post-concussion syndrome symptoms compared with placebo. Methods/Design: Ninety-nine youths with mild traumatic brain injury, aged between 13 and 18 years, who are symptomatic at 30 days post-injury will be recruited. This study will be conducted as a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial of melatonin. Three parallel treatment groups will be examined with a 1:1:1 allocation: sublingual melatonin 3 mg, sublingual melatonin 10 mg, and sublingual placebo. Participants will receive treatment for 28 days. The primary outcome is a change on the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (Parent and Youth). The secondary outcomes will include neurobehavioral function, health-related quality of life and sleep. Neurophysiological and structural markers of change, using magnetic resonance imaging techniques and transcranial magnetic stimulation, will also be investigated. Discussion: Melatonin is a safe and well-tolerated agent that has many biological properties that may be useful following a traumatic brain injury. This study will determine whether it is a useful treatment for children with post-concussion syndrome. Recruitment commenced on 4 December 2014.

SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-FUNCTIONING INDIVIDUALS; VISUAL-ACUITY; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; GABA CONCENTRATION; ASPERGER-SYNDROME; DISCRIMINATION; CORTEX; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS	Autistics demonstrate superior performances on several visuo-spatial tasks where local or detailed information processing is advantageous. Altered spatial filtering properties at an early level of visuo-spatial analysis may be a plausible perceptual origin for such detailed perception in Autism Spectrum Disorder. In this study, contrast sensitivity for both luminance and texture-defined vertically-oriented sine-wave gratings were measured across a range of spatial frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4 & 8 cpd) for autistics and non-autistic participants. Contrast sensitivity functions and peak frequency ratios were plotted and compared across groups. Results demonstrated that autistic participants were more sensitivity to luminance-defined, high spatial frequency gratings (8 cpd). A group difference in peak distribution was also observed as 35% of autistic participants manifested peak sensitivity for luminance-defined gratings of 4 cpd, compared to only 7% for the comparison group. These findings support that locally-biased perception in Autism Spectrum Disorder originates, at least in part, from differences in response properties of early spatial mechanisms favouring detailed spatial information processing.

Patients with a coexisting drug problem fare worse than patients who do not use drugs, and are also more difficult to treat. Current hypotheses cannot adequately account for why patients with schizophrenia so often have a co-morbid drug problem. I present here a complementary hypothesis based on evidence showing that chronic exposure to antipsychotic medications can induce supersensitivity within the brain's dopamine systems, and that this in turn can enhance the rewarding and incentive motivational effects of drugs and reward cues. At the neurobiological level, these effects of antipsychotics are potentially linked to antipsychotic-induced increases in the striatal levels of dopamine D2 receptors and D2 receptors in a high-affinity state for dopamine, particularly at postsynaptic sites. Antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity and enhanced reward function are not inevitable consequences of prolonged antipsychotic treatment. At least two parameters appear to promote these effects; the use of antipsychotics of the typical class, and continuous rather than intermittent antipsychotic exposure, such that silencing of dopaminergic neurotransmission via D2/3 receptors is unremitting. Thus, by inducing forms of neural plasticity that facilitate the ability of drugs and reward cues to gain control over behaviour, some currently used treatment strategies with typical antipsychotics might contribute to compulsive drug seeking and drug taking behaviours in vulnerable schizophrenia patients.

Production and Isolation of Axons from Sensory Neurons for Biochemical Analysis Using Porous Filters	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 89; neuron; axon; filter inserts; culture system; dorsal root ganglion; axonal degeneration	PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; MESSENGER-RNAS; DEGENERATION; DENDRITES; TRANSPORT	Neuronal axons use specific mechanisms to mediate extension, maintain integrity, and induce degeneration. An appropriate balance of these events is required to shape functional neuronal circuits. The protocol described here explains how to use cell culture inserts bearing a porous membrane (filter) to obtain large amounts of pure axonal preparations suitable for examination by conventional biochemical or immunocytochemical techniques. The functionality of these filter inserts will be demonstrated with models of developmental pruning and Wallerian degeneration, using explants of embryonic dorsal root ganglion. Axonal integrity and function is compromised in a wide variety of neurodegenerative pathologies. Indeed, it is now clear that axonal dysfunction appears much earlier in the course of the disease than neuronal soma loss in several neurodegenerative diseases, indicating that axonal-specific processes are primarily targeted in these disorders. By obtaining pure axonal samples for analysis by molecular and biochemical techniques, this technique has the potential to shed new light into mechanisms regulating the physiology and pathophysiology of axons. This in turn will have an impact in our understanding of the processes that drive degenerative diseases of the nervous system.

Conflicting guidelines exist regarding radiologic evaluation in such cases. Objective: To determine the practice pattern among Canadian emergency physicians for ordering skull radiographs in young children suffering from minor head trauma. Physicians were also surveyed on their willingness to use a clinical decision rule in such cases. Design/Methods: A self-administered email questionnaire was sent to all members of the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) group. It consisted of clinical vignettes followed by multiple-option answers on the management plan. The study was conducted using the principles of the Dillman Tailored Design method and included multiple emailings to maximize the response rate. The research protocol received Institutional Review Board approval. Results: A total of 158 of 295 (54%) PERC members responded. Most participants were trained in pediatric emergency medicine and assessed more than 500 children per year. Imaging management for the vignettes was highly variable: 6 of the 11 case scenarios had a proportion of radiograph ordering between 20 and 80%. Ninety-five percent of respondents stated that they would apply a validated clinical decision rule for the detection of skull fracture in young children with minor head trauma. The minimum sensitivity deemed acceptable for such a rule was 98%. Conclusion: Canadian emergency physicians have a wide variation in skull radiography ordering in young children with minor head trauma.

The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) and the Canadian Council of Motor Transportation Administrators (CCMTA) publish documents to guide Canadian physicians' driver fitness assessments. Objectives: We aimed to measure the consistency of driver fitness counseling among epileptologists in Canada, and to determine whether inconsistencies between national guidelines are associated with greater variability in counseling instructions. Methods: We surveyed 35 epileptologists in Canada (response rate 71%) using a questionnaire that explored physicians' philosophies about driver fitness assessments and counseling practices of seizure patients in common clinical scenarios. Of the nine scenarios, CCMTA and CMA recommendations were concordant for only two. Cumulative agreement for all scenarios was calculated using Kappa statistic. Agreement for concordant (two) vs. discordant (seven) scenarios were split at the median and analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. Results: Overall the agreement between respondents for the clinical scenarios was not acceptable (Kappa=0.28). For the two scenarios where CMA and CCMTA guidelines were concordant, specialists had high levels of agreement with recommendations (89% each). A majority of specialists disagreed with CMA recommendations in three of seven discordant scenarios. The lack of consistency in respondents' agreement attained statistical significance (p<0.001). Conclusions: Canadian epileptologists have variable counseling practices about driving, and this may be attributable to inconsistencies between CMA and CCMTA medical fitness guidelines. This study highlights the need to harmonize driving recommendations in order to prevent physician and patient confusion about driving fitness in Canada.

The aim of this study was to determine the demographic, clinical, medical and accident related trends for patients with TBI hospitalized in an urban Level 1 Trauma Centre. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected on individuals (n = 5,642) who were admitted to the Traumatic Brain Injury Program of the McGill University Health Centre - Montreal General Hospital from 2000 to 2011. Results: Regression analysis showed a significant upward trend in the yearly number of cases as well as an upward trending by year in the proportion of TBI cases aged 70-years-old or more. The Injury Severity Scale scores were positively associated with year indicating a slight increase in injury severity over the years and there was an increase in patient psychological, social and medical premorbid complexity. In addition, the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score tended to become more severe over the years. There was a slight decrease in the proportion of discharges home and in the proportion of deaths. Conclusions: These results will help to understand the impact of TBI in an urban Canadian Level 1 Trauma Centre. This information should be used to develop public prevention strategies and to educate the community about the risk of TBI especially the risk of falls in the ageing population. These findings can also provide information to help health policy makers plan for future resources.

Pioneer experiments by Holtfreter had shown that embryonic cells can sort based on tissue affinities, which have long been considered to rely on differences in cell-cell adhesion. However, vertebrate embryonic tissues also express a variety of cell surface cues, in particular ephrins and Eph receptors, and there is now firm evidence that these molecules are systematically used to induce local repulsion at contacts between different cell types, efficiently preventing mixing of adjacent cell populations.

ACUTE MECHANICAL INJURY OF THE HUMAN INTERVERTEBRAL DISC: LINK TO DEGENERATION AND PAIN	EUROPEAN CELLS & MATERIALS			English	Article						Intervertebral disc; mechanical injury; inflammation; extracellular matrix; degeneration; nerve growth factor	NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; VERTEBRAL END-PLATE; DYNAMIC COMPRESSION; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; GENE-EXPRESSION; ORGAN-CULTURE; ANNULUS CELLS; SUBSTANCE-P; BACK-PAIN; IN-VITRO	Excessive mechanical loading or acute trauma to intervertebral discs (IVDs) is thought to contribute to degeneration and pain. However, the exact mechanisms by which mechanical injury initiates and promotes degeneration remain unclear. This study investigates biochemical changes and extracellular matrix disruption in whole-organ human IVD cultures following acute mechanical injury. Isolated healthy human IVDs were rapidly compressed by 5% (non-injured) or 30% (injured) of disc height. 30% strain consistently cracked cartilage endplates, confirming disc trauma. Three days post-loading, conditioned media were assessed for proteoglycan content and released cytokines. Tissue extracts were assessed for proteoglycan content and for aggrecan integrity. Conditioned media were applied to PC12 cells to evaluate if factors inducing neurite growth were released. Compared to controls, IVD injury caused significant cell death. Injury also caused significantly reduced tissue proteoglycan content with a reciprocal increase of proteoglycan content in culture media. Increased aggrecan fragmentation was observed in injured tissue due to increased matrix metalloproteinase and aggrecanase activity. Injured-IVD conditioned media contained significantly elevated interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, MCP-2, GRO alpha, and MIG, and ELISA analysis showed significantly increased nerve growth factor levels compared to non-injured media. Injured-disc media caused significant neurite sprouting in PC12 cells compared to non-injured media. Acute mechanical injury of human IVDs ex vivo initiates release of factors and enzyme activity associated with degeneration and back pain. This work provides direct evidence linking acute trauma, inflammatory factors, neo-innervation and potential degeneration and discogenic pain in vivo.	[Roughley, P.

Despite remarkable advances in our understanding of these diseases, no curative treatment for MNDs exists. To better understand the pathogenesis of MNDs and to help develop new treatments, the establishment of animal models that can be studied efficiently and thoroughly is paramount. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly becoming a valuable model for studying human diseases and in screening for potential therapeutics. In this Review, we highlight recent progress in using zebrafish to study the pathology of the most common MNDs: spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). These studies indicate the power of zebrafish as a model to study the consequences of disease-related genes, because zebrafish homologues of human genes have conserved functions with respect to the aetiology of MNDs. Zebrafish also complement other animal models for the study of pathological mechanisms of MNDs and are particularly advantageous for the screening of compounds with therapeutic potential. We present an overview of their potential usefulness in MND drug discovery, which is just beginning and holds much promise for future therapeutic development.

Natl Res Council Canada	Development of the McGill simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery: A new high-fidelity virtual reality simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY & ALLERGY			English	Article							SURGICAL SIMULATION; CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY; OPERATING-ROOM; PERFORMANCE	Background: The technical challenges of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and the high risk of complications support the development of alternative modalities to train residents in these procedures. Virtual reality simulation is becoming a useful tool for training the skills necessary for minimally invasive surgery; however, there are currently no ESS virtual reality simulators available with valid evidence supporting their use in resident education. Our aim was to develop a new rhinology simulator, as well as to define potential performance metrics for trainee assessment. Methods: The McGill simulator for endoscopic sinus surgery (MSESS), a new sinus surgery virtual reality simulator with haptic feedback, was developed (a collaboration between the McGill University Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, the Montreal Neurologic Institute Simulation Lab, and the National Research Council of Canada). A panel of experts in education, performance assessment, rhinology, and skull base surgery convened to identify core technical abilities that would need to be taught by the simulator, as well as performance metrics to be developed and captured. Results: The MSESS allows the user to perform basic sinus surgery skills, such as an ethmoidectomy and sphenoidotomy, through the use of endoscopic tools in a virtual nasal model. The performance metrics were developed by an expert panel and include measurements of safety, quality, and efficiency of the procedure. Conclusion: The MSESS incorporates novel technological advancements to create a realistic platform for trainees. To our knowledge, this is the first simulator to combine novel tools such as the endonasal wash and elaborate anatomic deformity with advanced performance metrics for ESS.

ORIGIN Investigators	Effects of basal insulin glargine and omega-3 fatty acid on cognitive decline and probable cognitive impairment in people with dysglycaemia: a substudy of the ORIGIN trial	LANCET DIABETES & ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							MINI-MENTAL-STATE; INTRANASAL INSULIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS; BRAIN; GLUCOSE; MEMORY; RISK; LIFE; DYSGLYCEMIA	Background Diabetes and non-diabetic dysglycaemia are risk factors for accelerated cognitive decline. In this planned substudy of the Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial, we assessed whether normalising glucose with insulin glargine or administering omega-3 fatty acids in this population may slow this process or affect the development of cognitive impairment. Methods The ORIGIN trial recruited participants older than 50 years with dysglycaemia who were taking either no or one oral glucose-lowering drug, who had additional risk factors for cardiovascular events, whose HbA(1c) was less than 9%, and who were not taking insulin. Participants were recruited from 573 sites in 40 countries. Participants were randomly assigned to either titrated basal insulin glargine targeting a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 5.3 mmol/L or lower or standard care and to either omega-3 fatty acid (1 g) or placebo by a factorial design. Outcome adjudicators and data analysts were masked to treatment allocation. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMS) and Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS). The effect of insulin glargine or omega-3 fatty * acid on cognitive function over time, the annualised change in test scores, and the development of probable cognitive impairment were measured. All analyses were restricted to those participants who had a cognitive measurement at both baseline and at least one follow-up visit. The ORIGIN trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00069784. Findings Participants were randomly assigned between Sept 1, 2003, and Dec 15, 2005. MMSE and DSS were assessed in 11 685 and 3392 ORIGIN participants (mean age 63.4 years [SD 7.7]), who were followed up for a median of 6.2 years (IQR 5.8-6.7). There was no difference in the rate of change of cognitive test scores between the insulin glargine and standard care groups (for the MMSE 0.0046, 95% CI -0.0132 to 0.0224, p=0.39; and for the DSS -0.0362, -0.2180 to 0.1455, p=0.34) or between the omega-3 fatty acid and placebo groups (for the MMSE 0.0013, 95% CI -0.0165 to 0.0191, p=0.21; and for the DSS -0.0605, -0.2422 to 0.1212, p=0.72). Similarly, the incidence of probable cognitive impairment did not differ between the insulin glargine and standard care groups (p=0.065) or the omega-3 fatty acid and placebo groups (p=0.070). In a subgroup analysis, allocation to insulin glargine versus standard care seemed to reduce the decline in the MMSE (but not the DSS) in participants with dysglycaemia but without evidence of diabetes (p(interaction)=0.024). Interpretation In this relatively young cohort of people with dysglycaemia, insulin mediated normoglycaemia and omega-3 fatty acid for over 6 years had a neutral effect on the rate of cognitive decline and on incident cognitive impairment. Future studies should assess the effect of these interventions in an older cohort or the effect of other glucometabolic interventions on cognitive decline.

Respiratory mechanics in commonly used large animal species (Beagle dogs, Cynomolgus monkeys, and Gottingen minipigs) were compared. Methods: Eighteen animals were used (3/sex/species) in an anesthetized model (propofol infusion) with pancuronium as a neuromuscular blocker. Parameters of respiratory mechanics were evaluated at baseline and at peak drug effect. Resistance (R-rs) and elastance (E-rs) were measured by applying a single frequency forced oscillation (0.5 Hz) to the subject's airway opening and fitting the flow, volume and pressure data to the single compartment model of the lung. Increasing doses of intravenous (IV) methacholine were administered in all three species, as well as doubling aerosolized concentrations of the same bronchoconstrictor agent before and after inhaled albuterol. Results: The slope of the IV methacholine dose-response curve for Rrs was similar in dogs and monkeys and both species differed from minipigs, which showed greater reactivity. At the highest IV dose tested, minipigs also reached higher levels of bronchoconstriction than the other two species. They were followed, in decreasing order, by dogs and monkeys. Albuterol induced a significant decrease in the slope of the dose-response curve only in dogs and monkeys. Discussion: Scientific literature is available on respiratory mechanics in monkeys and dogs but not in minipigs. Our results suggest that minipigs were more reactive than dogs and monkeys to IV methacholine while less sensitive to inhaled albuterol. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

No treatment is available for these disorders. We identified 2 unrelated families, each with 2 siblings with severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency manifesting a complicated form of adult-onset hereditary spastic paraparesis partially responsive to betaine therapy. OBSERVATIONS Both pairs of siblings presented with a similar combination of progressive spastic paraparesis and polyneuropathy, variably associated with behavioral changes, cognitive impairment, psychosis, seizures, and leukoencephalopathy, beginning between the ages of 29 and 50 years. By the time of diagnosis a decade later, 3 patients were ambulatory and 1 was bedridden. Investigations have revealed severe hyperhomocysteinemia and hypomethioninemia, reduced fibroblast MTHFR enzymatic activity (18%-52% of control participants), and 3 novel pathogenic MTHFR mutations, 2 as compound heterozygotes in one family and 1 as a homozygous mutation in the other family. Treatment with betaine produced a rapid decline of homocysteine by 50% to 70% in all 4 patients and. over 9 to 15 years, improved the conditions of the 3 ambulatory patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although severe MTHFR deficiency is a rare cause of complicated spastic paraparesis in adults, it should be considered in select patients because of the potential therapeutic benefit of betaine supplementation.

Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and brain development: The case of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Secondhand smoke; Tobacco smoke; Environmental tobacco smoke; Sidestream smoke; ADHD; Neurotoxins; Nicotine; Child development; Developmental psychopathology	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; MATERNAL CIGARETTE-SMOKING; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER GENOTYPE; CHILDHOOD CONDUCT PROBLEMS; SCOTTISH-HEALTH-SURVEY; SECONDHAND SMOKE; PRENATAL-EXPOSURE; MENTAL-HEALTH; NEURONAL DEVELOPMENT	Environmental tobacco smoke, inhaled by active firsthand smokers and their entourage, is associated with morbidity and mortality. Many children are passively exposed to secondhand smoke worldwide. Infants and young children account for the largest global disease burden associated with prenatal and postnatal secondhand smoke, probably due to underdeveloped neurological, immune, and respiro-circulatory systems. There is an increasingly robust association between tobacco smoke exposure, before and after birth, and executive function problems in children, adding to current and future disease burden estimates in public health. This review summarizes research advancements which address the link between environmental tobacco smoke and the development of attention deficits and hyperactive behavior, both as symptoms and as part of a mental health disorder in childhood. The multiple effects of tobacco smoke inhalation are best understood in terms of disruptions in normative processes involving cellular communication, structural development, and epigenetic influences which have the potential to become intergenerational. It is concluded that public health efforts be directed toward increasing parental awareness and compliance with existing guidelines that recommend no safe level of exposure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment of Human Islet Grafts in Frozen Sections of CD-1 Athymic nu/nu Mouse Liver for Molecular Analysis	TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th World Congress of the International-Pancreas-and-Islet-Transplant-Association (IPITA)	SEP 24-27, 2013	Monterey, CA	Int Pancreas & Islet Transplant Assoc			TRANSPLANTATION	Background. Post-transplantation islet graft monitoring is hampered by a lack of efficient methods to locate and analyze islets in situ. We evaluated histologic methods to rapidly locate islets within the liver parenchyma post-transplantation, using several staining strategies, prior to analysis using laser capture microdissection. Methods. Human islets were isolated (n = 8) from brain dead, multiorgan donor pancreases at the McGill University Health Centre Islet Transplant Laboratory. Mean yield was 247,609 +/- 195,272 IE and 3172 +/- 1645 IE/g (purity and viability, respectively, 84.5 +/- 8.6% and 95 +/- 5% average; mean +/- SD). Diabetic athymic CD-1 nu/nu mice (streptozotocin intraperitoneal injection, 200 mg/kg) were maintained with sustained release insulin pellets until a suitable islet preparation was available for transplant. Intraportal islet transplantation of 2000 IE/mouse was performed via the ileocecal vein, as previously described. Frozen sections of liver containing human islets were prepared from specimens collected on days 0, 4, and 30 post-transplant. Every twentieth slide from serial sectioned liver was stained using a rapid protocol to determine if islets were present. Sections were fixed and stained for 5 minutes with either an anti-human insulin fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated primary antibody (Ins-FITC), Newport Green (NG), or diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone, DZ). Results. Islets were readily localized using each technique, mostly toward the liver periphery. However, DZ had a faint appearance in 10-mu m-thick sections and was best utilized to locate sections containing islets during sectioning. Conclusion. Ins-FITC, NG, and DZ are all good candidates for a rapid islet staining protocol to evaluate human islet grafts in situ, with DZ being best for sectioning and Ins-FITC and NG being equal in locating islets during processing for laser capture microdissection.

Treatment outcomes are determined by complex interactions between cancer genetics, treatment regimens, and patient-related variables. A key component of modern radiation oncology research is to predict at the time of treatment planning or during the course of fractionated radiation treatment, the probability of tumor eradication and normal tissue risks for the type of treatment being considered for the individual patient. A typical radiotherapy treatment scenario can generate a large pool of panomics data that may comprise 3D/4D anatomical and functional imaging information (noted as radiomics), in addition to biological markers (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) derived from peripheral blood and tissue specimens. Radiotherapy data informatics constitutes a unique interface between physical and biological processes. It can benefit from the general advances in biomedical informatics research while still requires the development of its own technologies within this framework to address specific issues related to its unique physics-biology interface. We review recent advances and discuss current challenges to interrogate panomics data in radiotherapy using bioinformatics tools for data aggregation, sharing, visualization, and outcomes modeling. We provide examples based on our and others experiences using systems radiobiology and machine learning to develop predictive models of outcomes in radiotherapy. We also highlight the potential opportunities in this field for evidence-based personalized medicine research for bioinformaticians and clinical decision-makers. (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, we hypothesized that speech perceptual training might immediately influence speech motor learning. To test this, we paired a speech perceptual-training task with a speech motor-learning task. Subjects performed a series of perceptual tests designed to measure and then manipulate the perceptual distinction between the words head and had. Subjects then produced head with the sound of the vowel altered in real time so that they heard themselves through headphones producing a word that sounded more like had. In support of our hypothesis, the amount of motor learning in response to the voice alterations depended on the perceptual boundary acquired through perceptual training. The studies show that plasticity in adults' speech perception can have immediate consequences for speech production in the context of speech learning.

Current management approaches in the care of the patient with a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy include use of serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to establish and monitor hypomyelination, molecular diagnostics to determine a specific etiology, and equally importantly, careful attention to neurologic complications over time. Emerging research in oligodendrocyte biology and neuroradiology with bedside applications may result in the possibility of clinical trials in the near term, yet there are significant gaps in knowledge in disease classification, characterization, and outcome measures in this group of disorders. Here we review the biological background of myelination, the clinical and genetic variability in hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, and the insights that can be obtained from current MRI techniques. In addition, we discuss ongoing research approaches to define potential outcome markers for future clinical trials.	[Pouwels, Petra J.

Recent research has linked OT to maternal caregiving behavior towards her infant, and to postpartum depressive symptomatology. There is also evidence that psychosocial adversity affects the oxytocin system. The present study investigated the relationship of endogenous OT in women during pregnancy and at 8 weeks postpartum to psychosocial stress, maternal symptoms of depression, and maternal sensitive behavior. It was hypothesized that OT would mediate the effects of maternal depressive symptoms on maternal interactive behavior. We also tested the hypothesis that psychosocial stress would moderate the relationship between OT and maternal depressive symptoms and sensitive behavior. A community sample of 287 women was assessed at 12-14 weeks of gestation, 32-34 weeks of gestation, and 7-9 weeks postpartum. We measured plasma OT, maternal symptoms of depression and psychosocial stress. At the postpartum home visit, maternal behavior in interaction with the infant was videotaped, and then coded to assess sensitivity. In the sample as a whole, OT was not related to maternal depressive symptoms or to sensitive maternal behavior. However, among women who reported high levels of psychosocial stress, higher levels of plasma OT were associated with fewer depressive symptoms and more sensitive maternal behavior. These results suggest that endogenous OT may act as a buffer against the deleterious effects of stress, thereby protecting high risk women from developing depressive symptoms and promoting more sensitive maternal interactive behavior.

J	Chapados, C; Petrides, M				Chapados, Catherine; Petrides, Michael			Utilization behavior after lesions restricted to the frontal cortex	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Frontal cortex; Utilization behavior; Executive functions	THALAMIC INFARCTION; LOBE DAMAGE; IMITATION	Utilization behavior, which refers to the tendency of patients to use objects presented to them out of context and in the absence of instructions to use them, has been ascribed to dysfunction of the frontal cortex. However, careful examination of the reports of patients presenting utilization behavior shows that these patients had sustained widespread cerebral lesions extending beyond the frontal cortex and often involving massive subcortical damage. The present study examined whether utilization behavior can be observed in patients with lesions restricted to the prefrontal cortex and no more than the immediately subjacent white matter. All patients had surgical excisions, except for three patients in the frontal group who had sustained a cerebrovascular accident. A group of patients with excisions in the temporal lobe and a group of healthy participants were also studied for comparison. The investigation of utilization behavior took place in the context of a broader neuropsychological examination. There was no difference in the presence of utilization behavior in patients with lesions restricted to the prefrontal cortex in comparison with patients with temporal lobe lesions and carefully matched neurologically intact individuals. The results suggest that, in previous studies, the exhibition of utilization behavior by patients with extensive damage to the anterior part of the brain may have been due to damage to subcortical structures or to the prefrontal cortex in conjunction with subcortical damage.

We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the effects of PCSE on neural correlates of inhibitory control of behavior. In a prospective longitudinal study on child development in the Canadian Arctic, we assessed 186 Inuit children (mean age = 11.3 years) on a visual Go/No-go response inhibition paradigm. PCSE was assessed through maternal recall. Potential confounders were documented from a maternal interview, and exposure to neurotoxic environmental contaminants was assessed from umbilical cord and child blood samples. PCSE was not related to behavioral performance on this simple response inhibition task. Nevertheless, this exposure was associated with smaller amplitudes of the N2 and P3 components elicited by No-go stimuli, suggesting an impairment in the neural processes underlying response inhibition. Amplitude of the No-go P3 component was also inversely associated with behavioral measures of externalizing problems and hyperactivity/impulsivity in the classroom. This study is the first to report neurophysiological evidence of impaired response inhibition in school-aged children exposed to tobacco smoke in utero. Effects were found on ERP components associated with conflict processing and inhibition of a prepotent response, indicating neurophysiological deficits that may play a critical role in the attention and behavior problems observed in children with PCSE.

To be able to provide treatment, the first step is to establish the right diagnosis. Once the cause of the ataxia is defined, some specific treatments may be available. For example, the nongenetic ataxias that arise from vitamin deficiencies can improve following treatment. In most cases, however, therapies do not cure the disease and are purely symptomatic. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are effective in all type of ataxias and often remain the most efficient treatment option for these patients to maximize their quality of life.

Although the majority of HTLV-1 carriers remain asymptomatic throughout their lives, some patients could develop neurological disorder, inflammatory arthropathy also called HTLV-1-associated arthropathy or T-cell malignancy, the adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma or ATL with a very poor prognosis. Described to be very close to rheumatoid arthritis, HTLV-1-associated arthropathy patients have few or no response to the first line therapy with corticosteroids and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARDs. The use of anti-TNF-alpha agents in these patients is an interesting alternative but asks the question of risk of developing an adult T-Cell leukemia/lymphoma. We reported an exceptional case of a smoldering ATL patient with an HTLV-1-associated arthropathy, refractory to corticosteroid, DMARDs and rituximab therapy, treated successfully with etanercept, without progression to aggressive ATL after 5 years.

Uri			Neuronal Injury External to the Retina Rapidly Activates Retinal Glia, Followed by Elevation of Markers for Cell Cycle Re-Entry and Death in Retinal Ganglion Cells	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY; OPTIC-NERVE TRANSECTION; GROWTH-FACTOR; GLAUCOMA; PROTEINS; ANEUPLOIDY; EXPRESSION; SURVIVAL; KINASE; DAMAGE	Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are neurons that relay visual signals from the retina to the brain. The RGC cell bodies reside in the retina and their fibers form the optic nerve. Full transection (axotomy) of the optic nerve is an extra-retinal injury model of RGC degeneration. Optic nerve transection permits time-kinetic studies of neurodegenerative mechanisms in neurons and resident glia of the retina, the early events of which are reported here. One day after injury, and before atrophy of RGC cell bodies was apparent, glia had increased levels of phospho-Akt, phospho-S6, and phospho-ERK1/2; however, these signals were not detected in injured RGCs. Three days after injury there were increased levels of phospho-Rb and cyclin A proteins detected in RGCs, whereas these signals were not detected in glia. DNA hyperploidy was also detected in RGCs, indicative of cell cycle re-entry by these post-mitotic neurons. These events culminated in RGC death, which is delayed by pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Our data show that a remote injury to RGC axons rapidly conveys a signal that activates retinal glia, followed by RGC cell cycle re-entry, DNA hyperploidy, and neuronal death that is delayed by preventing glial MAPK/ERK activation. These results demonstrate that complex and variable neuro-glia interactions regulate healthy and injured states in the adult mammalian retina.	[Galan, Alba; Dergham, Pauline; Saragovi, H.

Here, we tested the causal nature of this link and examined if the categorization of an ambiguous approach- or withdrawal-related vocal signal can be biased by manipulating left and right frontal neural activity. We used voice morphing of affective non-verbal vocalizations to create individually tailored affectively ambiguous stimuli on an Anger-Fear continuum-two emotions that represent extremes on the approach-withdrawal dimension. We tested perception of these stimuli after 10 min of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or over the vertex (control), a technique that has transient inhibitory effects on the targeted brain region. As expected, ambiguous stimuli were more likely perceived as expressing Anger (approach) than Fear (withdrawal) after right prefrontal compared with left prefrontal or control stimulation. These results provide the first evidence that the manipulation of asymmetrical activity in prefrontal cortex can change the explicit categorization of ambiguous emotional signals.

With advancements in IMS of lipids, there is a demand for large-scale tissue studies necessitating stable, efficient and well-defined sample handling procedures. Our work within this article shows the effects of different storage conditions on the phospholipid composition of sectioned tissues from mouse organs. We have taken serial sections from mouse brain, kidney and liver thaw mounted unto ITO-coated glass slides and stored them under various conditions later analyzing them at fixed time points. A global decrease in phospholipid signal intensity is shown to occur and to be a function of time and temperature. Contrary to the global decrease, oxidized phospholipid and lysophospholipid species are found to increase within 2 h and 24 h, respectively, when mounted sections are kept at ambient room conditions. Imaging experiments reveal that degradation products increase globally across the tissue. Degradation is shown to be inhibited by cold temperatures, with sample integrity maintained up to a week after storage in -80 degrees C freezer under N-2 atmosphere. Overall, the results demonstrate a timeline of the effects of lipid degradation specific to sectioned tissues and provide several lipid species which can serve as markers of degradation. Importantly, the timeline demonstrates oxidative sample degradation begins appearing within the normal timescale of IMS sample preparation of lipids (i.e. 1-2 h) and that long-term degradation is global. Taken together, these results strengthen the notion that standardized procedures are required for phospholipid IMS of large sample sets, or in studies where many serial sections are prepared together but analyzed over time such as in 3-D IMS reconstruction experiments.

Method: This study used a prospective longitudinal design. One hundred twenty-two older adults with single-domain or multiple-domain amnestic MCI were recruited from memory clinics. They completed tests to measure baseline episodic memory, working memory, executive functions, perception, and language. They were then followed annually to determine with criteria independent from those tests whether they had remained stable or had developed dementia or significant cognitive decline. This was used as the reference standard to measure diagnostic test accuracy value. Results: ANOVAs indicated that participants with progressive MCI showed more impaired performance than those with stable MCI at baseline on episodic memory (word and story recall), the Brown-Peterson working memory test, object naming, object decision, and position of gap test. Logistic regression derived a significant model with 87.8% overall predictive value. The model included delayed text memory, free recall, naming, orientation match, object decision, and alpha span. Its sensitivity was 86.2% and its specificity was 88.9%. Positive predictive value was 83.3%, and negative predictive value was particularly high at 90.9%. Conclusions: Identifying individuals with MCI who will progress to dementia or more severe cognitive impairment is a challenge. This study shows that cognitive measures provide valuable information regarding the predictive diagnosis of persons with MCI. Predictive accuracy of a cognitive battery might be optimized by selecting both memory and nonmemory measures.

In a previous paper [1], we investigated the implementation of vocalic height contrasts along the F1 dimension in French speakers. In this paper, we present results from perceptual identification tests performed by twelve participants who took part in the production experiment reported in the earlier paper. For each subject, stimuli presented in the identification test were synthesized in two different vowel spaces, corresponding to two different vocal tract lengths. The results showed that first, the perceived French vowels belonging to similar height degrees were aligned on stable F1 values, independent of place of articulation and roundedness, as was the case for produced vowels. Second, the produced F1 distances between height degrees correlated with the perceived F1 distances. This suggests that there is a link between perceptual and motor phonemic prototypes in the human brain.

MRI Surrogates for Molecular Subgroups of Medulloblastoma	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							TUMOR LOCATION; SUBTYPES; ADULTS; SEQUELAE; FEATURES; CHILDREN	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently identified molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma have shown potential for improved risk stratification. We hypothesized that distinct MR imaging features can predict these subgroups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma at one institution, with both pretherapy MR imaging and surgical tissue, served as the discovery cohort (n = 47). MR imaging features were assessed by 3 blinded neuroradiologists. NanoString-based assay of tumor tissues was conducted to classify the tumors into the 4 established molecular subgroups (wingless, sonic hedgehog, group 3, and group 4). A second pediatric medulloblastoma cohort (n = 52) from an independent institution was used for validation of the MR imaging features predictive of the molecular subtypes. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis within the discovery cohort revealed tumor location (P < .001) and enhancement pattern (P = .001) to be significant predictors of medulloblastoma subgroups. Stereospecific computational analyses confirmed that group 3 and 4 tumors predominated within the midline fourth ventricle (100%, P = .007), wingless tumors were localized to the cerebellar peduncle/cerebellopontine angle cistern with a positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI, 30%-100%), and sonic hedgehog tumors arose in the cerebellar hemispheres with a positive predictive value of 100% (95% Cl, 59%-100%). Midline group 4 tumors presented with minimal/no enhancement with a positive predictive value of 91%.(95% CI, 59%-98%). When we used the MR imaging feature based regression model, 66% of medulloblastomas were correctly predicted in the discovery cohort, and 65%, in the validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor location and enhancement pattern were predictive of molecular subgroups of pediatric medulloblastoma and may potentially serve as a surrogate for genomic testing.

Genetically encoded impairment of neuronal KCC2 cotransporter function in human idiopathic generalized epilepsy	EMBO REPORTS			English	Article						cation-chloride cotransporters; epilepsy; GABA; KCC2; kinase	K-CL COTRANSPORTER; CATION-CHLORIDE COTRANSPORTERS; PHOSPHORYLATION; SEIZURE; NKCC1; BRAIN; NEUROTRANSMISSION; HYPEREXCITABILITY; TRANSPORTERS; SENSITIVITY	The KCC2 cotransporter establishes the low neuronal Cl(-)levels required for GABA(A) and glycine (Gly) receptor-mediated inhibition, and KCC2 deficiency in model organisms results in network hyperexcitability. However, no mutations in KCC2 have been documented in human disease. Here, we report two non-synonymous functional variants in human KCC2, R952H and R1049C, exhibiting clear statistical association with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). These variants reside in conserved residues in the KCC2 cytoplasmic C-terminus, exhibit significantly impaired Cl- -extrusion capacities resulting in less hyperpolarized Gly equilibrium potentials (E-Gly), and impair KCC2 stimulatory phosphorylation at serine 940, a key regulatory site. These data describe a novel KCC2 variant significantly associated with a human disease and suggest genetically encoded impairment of KCC2 functional regulation may be a risk factor for the development of human IGE.

Parental bad habits breed bad behaviors in youth: Exposure to gestational smoke and child impulsivity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Gestational smoking; Tobacco; Nicotine; Impulsivity; Classroom engagement; Cognitive control	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MATERNAL PRENATAL SMOKING; LATER ACHIEVEMENT; SCHOOL READINESS; BIRTH-WEIGHT; RISK-FACTOR; PREGNANCY; ATTENTION; INTERVENTION; ASSOCIATIONS	In utero exposure to cigarette smoke has been shown to have an adverse effect on healthy brain development in childhood. In the present study, we examine whether fetal exposure to mild and heavy smoking is associated with lower levels of impulsivity and cognitive control at age 10. Using a sample of 2120 children from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, we examine the association between gestational cigarette smoke exposure and fourth grade teacher reports of impulsivity and classroom engagement which represent behavioral indicators of executive functions. When compared to children of non-smokers, children of mothers who reported smoking heavily during pregnancy (10 or more cigarettes per day) were rated by their fourth grade teachers as displaying higher levels of impulsive behavior, scoring.112 standard deviation units higher than children of non-smokers. Children of mothers who smoked heavily were also less engaged in the classroom, scoring.057 standard deviation units lower than children of women who did not smoke. These analyses were adjusted for many potentially confounding child and family variables. Exposure to perinatal nicotine may compromise subsequent brain development. In particular, fetal nicotine may be associated with impairment in areas recruited for the effortful control of behavior in later childhood, a time when task-orientation and industriousness are imperative for academic success.

Blood total ketone body (TKB) levels should be evaluated in the context of clinical history, such as fasting time and ketogenic stresses. Blood TKB should also be evaluated in parallel with blood glucose and free fatty acids (FFA). The FFA/TKB ratio is especially useful for evaluation of ketone body metabolism. Defects in ketogenesis include mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase (mHS) deficiency and HMG-CoA lyase (HL) deficiency. mHS deficiency should be considered in non-ketotic hypoglycemia if a fatty acid beta-oxidation defect is suspected, but cannot be confirmed. Patients with HL deficiency can develop hypoglycemic crises and neurological symptoms even in adolescents and adults. Succinyl-CoA-3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) deficiency and beta-ketothiolase (T2) deficiency are two defects in ketolysis. Permanent ketosis is pathognomonic for SCOT deficiency. However, patients with "mild" SCOT mutations may have nonketotic periods. T2-deficient patients with "mild" mutations may have normal blood acylcarnitine profiles even in ketoacidotic crises. T2 deficient patients cannot be detected in a reliable manner by newborn screening using acylcarnitines. We review recent data on clinical presentation, metabolite profiles and the course of these diseases in adults, including in pregnancy.

Because cancer can occur at any age, it is imperative that pain assessment tools are valid for use across the adult lifespan. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2) is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of the multidimensional qualities of pain in people with chronic nonmalignant pain, but its psychometric properties in people with cancer pain and in older versus younger people require investigation. This study evaluated age differences in the validity, reliability, and use of the SF-MPQ-2 in 244 people with advanced cancer and pain. We confirmed the previously reported 4-factor solution in older (>= 60 years) and younger (<60 years) patients. Internal consistency reliability and convergent validity were similar across age groups, although the SF-MPQ-2 sensory subscales were correlated with mental health quality of life in older, but not younger, patients. Older and younger patients selected the same words with the same intensity to describe their pain. The most commonly selected words in both age groups were aching, tiring-exhausting, sharp, and dull. These results demonstrate that the SF-MPQ-2 is appropriate for use across the adult lifespan in people with cancer pain. Perspective: This study demonstrated that the SF-MPQ-2 is valid for use in older and younger' people with advanced cancer and pain. This measure could improve cancer pain assessment across the adult lifespan, which may lead to improved pain management.

Methods: We implemented an automated classifier relying on surface-based features of FCD morphology and intensity, taking advantage of their covariance. The method was tested on 19 patients (15 with histologically confirmed FCD) scanned at 3.0T, and cross-validated using a leave-one-out strategy. We assessed specificity in 24 healthy controls and 11 disease controls with temporal lobe epilepsy. Cross-dataset classification performance was evaluated in 20 healthy controls and 14 patients with histologically verified FCD examined at 1.5T. Results: Sensitivity was 74%, with 100% specificity (i.e., no lesions detected in healthy or disease controls). In 50% of cases, a single cluster colocalized with the FCD lesion, while in the remaining cases a median of 1 extralesional cluster was found. Applying the classifier (trained on 3.0T data) to the 1.5T dataset yielded comparable performance (sensitivity 71%, specificity 95%). Conclusion: In patients initially diagnosed as MRI-negative, our fully automated multivariate approach offered a substantial gain in sensitivity over standard radiologic assessment. The proposed method showed generalizability across cohorts, scanners, and field strengths. Machine learning may assist presurgical decision-making by facilitating hypothesis formulation about the epileptogenic zone. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that automated machine learning of MRI patterns accurately identifies FCD among patients with extratemporal epilepsy initially diagnosed as MRI-negative.

Cefadroxil reduced the patient's pain and motor dysfunction (dystonia and impaired voluntary movement) within days; the pain and motor disorder returned when cefadroxil was discontinued; and both again abated when cefadroxil was re-instituted. The patient has now had symptom relief for more than 3 years on continuing cefadroxil therapy.

Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at increased risk of developing AD in adulthood as a result of chromosome 21 trisomy and triplication of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. In both conditions, the central nervous system (CNS) basal forebrain cholinergic system progressively degenerates, and such changes contribute to the manifestation of cognitive decline and dementia. Given the strong dependency of these neurons on nerve growth factor (NGF), it was hypothesized that their atrophy was caused by NGF deficits. However, in AD, the synthesis of NGF is not affected at the transcript level and there is a marked increase in its precursor, proNGF. This apparent paradox remained elusive for many years. In this review, we discuss the recent evidence supporting a CNS deficit in the extracellular metabolism of NGF, both in AD and in DS brains. We describe the nature of this trophic disconnection and its implication for the atrophy of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. We further discuss the potential of NGF pathway markers as diagnostic indicators of a CNS trophic disconnection.	[Iulita, M. Florencia; Cuello, A.

The recent availability of detailed information about transcript structure from high-throughput sequencing of messenger RNA (RNA-Seq) delineates many expressed genes and promises increased accuracy in gene prediction. Computational gene predictors have been intensively developed for and tested in well-studied animal genomes. Hundreds of fungal genomes are now or will soon be sequenced. The differences of fungal genomes from animal genomes and the phylogenetic sparsity of well-studied fungi call for gene-prediction tools tailored to them. Results: SnowyOwl is a new gene prediction pipeline that uses RNA-Seq data to train and provide hints for the generation of Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based gene predictions and to evaluate the resulting models. The pipeline has been developed and streamlined by comparing its predictions to manually curated gene models in three fungal genomes and validated against the high-quality gene annotation of Neurospora crassa; SnowyOwl predicted N. crassa genes with 83% sensitivity and 65% specificity. SnowyOwl gains sensitivity by repeatedly running the HMM gene predictor Augustus with varied input parameters and selectivity by choosing the models with best homology to known proteins and best agreement with the RNA-Seq data. Conclusions: SnowyOwl efficiently uses RNA-Seq data to produce accurate gene models in both well-studied and novel fungal genomes.

A comprehensive profile of the sociodemographic, psychosocial and health characteristics of Ontario home care clients with dementia	CHRONIC DISEASES AND INJURIES IN CANADA			English	Article						dementia; Alzheimer disease; neurological disorders; mental health; home care	MINIMUM DATA SET; LONG-TERM-CARE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NURSING-HOMES; OLDER-PEOPLE; COSTS; SCALE; MDS; INSTITUTIONALIZATION; POPULATION	Introduction: This study provides a comprehensive summary of the sociodemographic, psychosocial and health characteristics of a large population-based cohort of Ontario home care clients (aged 50 years and over) with dementia and examines the variation in these characteristics in those with co-existing neurological conditions. Methods: Clients were assessed with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC) between January 2003 and December 2010. Descriptive analyses examined the distribution of these characteristics among clients with dementia relative to several comparison groups, as well as clients with other recorded neurological conditions. Results: Approximately 22% of clients (n= 104 802) had a diagnosis of dementia (average age 83 years, 64% female) and about one in four within this group had a co-existing neurological condition (most commonly stroke or Parkinson disease). About 43% of those with dementia did not live with their primary caregiver. Relative to several comparison groups, clients with dementia showed considerably higher levels of cognitive and functional impairment, aggression, anxiety, wandering, hallucinations/delusions, caregiver distress and a greater risk for institutionalization. Conversely, they showed a lower prevalence of several chronic conditions and lower levels of recent health service use. Depressive symptoms were relatively common in the dementia and other neurological groups. Conclusion: Clients with co-existing neurological conditions exhibited unique clinical profiles illustrating the need for tailored and flexible home care services and enhanced caregiver assistance programs.

ALOX12 catalyzes the addition of oxygen to arachidonic acid, producing 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE), which can be reduced to the eicosanoid 12-HETE (12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). 12-HETE acts in diverse cellular processes, including catecholamine synthesis, vasoconstriction, neuronal function, and inflammation. Consistent with effects on these fundamental mechanisms, allelic variants of ALOX12 are associated with diseases including schizophrenia, atherosclerosis, and cancers, but the mechanisms have not been defined. Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite that causes morbidity and mortality and stimulates an innate and adaptive immune inflammatory reaction. Recently, it has been shown that a gene region known as Toxo1 is critical for susceptibility or resistance to T. gondii infection in rats. An orthologous gene region with ALOX12 centromeric is also present in humans. Here we report that the human ALOX12 gene has susceptibility alleles for human congenital toxoplasmosis (rs6502997 [ P, <0.000309], rs312462 [ P, <0.028499], rs6502998 [ P, <0.029794], and rs434473 [ P, <0.038516]). A human monocytic cell line was genetically engineered using lentivirus RNA interference to knock down ALOX12. In ALOX12 knockdown cells, ALOX12 RNA expression decreased and levels of the ALOX12 substrate, arachidonic acid, increased. ALOX12 knockdown attenuated the progression of T. gondii infection and resulted in greater parasite burdens but decreased consequent late cell death of the human monocytic cell line. These findings suggest that ALOX12 influences host responses to T. gondii infection in human cells. ALOX12 has been shown in other studies to be important in numerous diseases. Here we demonstrate the critical role ALOX12 plays in T. gondii infection in humans.

Despite the fundamental importance of blood flow control, how sympathetic arterial innervation develops remains largely unknown. Here, we identified the axon guidance cue netrin-1 as an essential factor required for development of arterial innervation in mice. Netrin-1 was produced by arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) at the onset of innervation, and arterial innervation required the interaction of netrin-1 with its receptor, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), on sympathetic growth cones. Function-blocking approaches, including cell type-specific deletion of the genes encoding Ntn1 in SMCs and Dcc in sympathetic neurons, led to severe and selective reduction of sympathetic innervation and to defective vasoconstriction in resistance arteries. These findings indicate that netrin-1 and DCC are critical for the control of arterial innervation and blood flow regulation in peripheral organs.

Canadian Critical Care Trials Grp	Acute Rehabilitation Practices in Critically Ill Children: A Multicenter Study	PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						acute rehabilitation; mobilization; pediatric critical care; physical therapy	PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE-CARE; PHYSICAL-THERAPY; FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY; SEVERE SEPSIS; MORTALITY; UNITS; PHYSIOTHERAPY; ICU; PREVALENCE; INITIATION	Objective: To evaluate acute rehabilitation practices in pediatric critical care units across Canada. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Six Canadian, tertiary care pediatric critical care units. Patients/Subjects: Six hundred children aged under 17 years admitted to pediatric critical care unit during a winter and summer month of 2011 with a greater than 24-hour length of stay. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome of interest was the nature and timing of pediatric critical care unit rehabilitation practices. Rehabilitation was classified according to mobility and nonmobility interventions. Predictors of mobilization and the time to mobilization were evaluated through regression and time-dependent survival analyses, respectively. The most common form of rehabilitation provided in pediatric critical care unit was physical therapy (45.5% patients) followed by occupational therapy (4.5%) and speech and language therapy (1.5%). Interventions were primarily nonmobility in nature (69.7% of sessions), most frequently in the form of chest physiotherapy (42.7% of sessions). The median time to mobilization was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-6) as compared with 1 day for nonmobility interventions (interquartile range, 1-3). Only 57 patients (9.5%) received early mobilization. Regression analyses revealed that increasing age, admission during winter, neuromuscular blockade, and sedative infusions were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving mobility therapy. Increasing age was a predictor of early mobilization, while neuromuscular blockade was associated with delayed mobilization. No significant differences in adverse events were found between nonmobility and mobility interventions. Conclusions: Only half of the children receive rehabilitation while in the pediatric critical care unit, and when it occurs, therapy is primarily focused on respiratory function. Mobilization appears to be reserved for at-risk children who were muscle relaxed and sedated; however, its implementation in these patients is delayed. Future pediatric-specific research is essential to identify patients at risk and to understand treatment priorities and rehabilitation strategies to improve functional recovery in critically ill children.

Our aim was to investigate the pattern of volume changes across hippocampal subfields in patients with primary insomnia relative to controls. Design: Pointwise morphometry allowed for volume measurements of hippocampal regions on T1-weighted MRI. Setting: University hospital. Patients: Twenty-seven unmedicated patients (age: 51.2 +/- 9.6 y) and 30 good sleepers as controls (50.4 +/- 7.1 y). Interventions: N/A. Measurements: We compared hippocampal subfield volumes between patients and controls and correlated volume with clinical and neuropsychological features in patients. Results: Patients exhibited bilateral atrophy across all hippocampal subfields (P < 0.05 corrected). Cornu ammonis (CA) 1 subfield atrophy was associated with worse sleep quality (higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and higher arousal index of polysomnography) (r < -0.45, P < 0.005). The volume of the combined region, including the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3-4, negatively correlated with verbal memory, verbal information processing, and verbal fluency in patients (vertical bar r vertical bar > 0.45, P < 0.05). Hemispheric volume asymmetry of this region (left smaller than right) was associated with impaired verbal domain functions (r = 0.50, P < 0.005). Conclusion: Hippocampal subfield atrophy in chronic insomnia suggests reduced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) and neuronal loss in the cornu ammonis (CA) subfields in conditions of sleep fragmentation and related chronic stress condition. Atrophy in the CA3-4-DG region was associated with impaired cognitive functions in patients. These observations may provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms that make patients with chronic sleep disturbance vulnerable to cognitive impairment.

The assessment of the metabolic relationship among brain regions has the potential to provide unique information regarding the disease process. Previous studies of metabolic correlation patterns have demonstrated alterations in AD subjects relative to age-matched, healthy control subjects. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between beta-amyloid, apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE epsilon 4) genotype, and metabolic correlations patterns in subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Mild cognitive impairment subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study were categorized into beta-amyloid-low and beta-amyloid-high groups, based on quantitative analysis of [F-18]florbetapir PET scans, and APOE epsilon 4 non-carriers and carriers based on genotyping. We generated voxel-wise metabolic correlation strength maps across the entire cerebral cortex for each group, and, subsequently, performed a seed-based analysis. We found that the APOE epsilon 4 genotype was closely related to regional glucose hypometabolism, while elevated, fibrillar beta-amyloid burden was associated with specific derangements of the metabolic correlation patterns.

Anne; Orlowski, John			Impaired posttranslational processing and trafficking of an endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger NHE6 mutant (Delta(WST372)-W-370) associated with X-linked intellectual disability and autism	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						NHE6; Recycling endosomes; Vesicular trafficking; Neurodegeneration; Intellectual disability	ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3; MENTAL-RETARDATION; DENDRITIC SPINES; CHRISTIANSON SYNDROME; RECYCLING ENDOSOMES; ANGELMAN-SYNDROME; SLC9A6 MUTATIONS; AMPA RECEPTORS	Ne+/H+ exchanger NHE6/SLC9A6 is an X-linked gene that is widely expressed and especially abundant in brain, heart and skeletal muscle where it is implicated in endosomal pH homeostasis and trafficking as well as maintenance of cell polarity. Recent genetic studies have identified several mutations in the coding region of NHE6 that are linked with severe intellectual disability, autistic behavior, ataxia and other abnormalities. One such defect consists of an in-frame deletion of three amino acids ((370)Trp-Ser-Thr(372), Delta WST) that adjoin the predicted ninth transmembrane helix of the exchanger. To better understand the nature of this mutation, a NHE6 Delta WST construct was generated and assessed for its effects on the biochemical and cellular properties of the transporter. In transfected fibroblastic CHO and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, immunoblot analyses showed that the mutant protein was effectively synthesized, but its subsequent oligosaccharide maturation and overall half-life were dramatically reduced compared to wild-type. These changes correlated with significant accumulation of AWST in the endoplasmic reticulum, with only minor sorting to the plasma membrane and negligible trafficking to recycling endosomes. The diminished accumulation in recycling endosomes was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of endocytosis of cell surface AWST compared to wild-type. Furthermore, while ectopic expression of wild-type NHE6 enhanced the uptake of other vesicular cargo such as transferrin along the clathrin-mediated recycling endosomal pathway, this ability was lost in the AWST mutant. Similarly, in transfected primary mouse hippocampal neurons, wild-type NHE6 was localized in discrete puncta throughout the soma and neurites, whereas the AWST mutant displayed a diffuse reticular pattern. Remarkably, the extensive dendritic arborization observed in neurons expressing wild-type NHE6 was noticeably diminished in Delta WST-transfectants. These results suggest that deletion of (370)Trp-Ser-Thr(372) leads to endoplasmic reticulum retention and loss of NHE6 function which potentially impacts the trafficking of other membrane-bound cargo and cell polarity.

Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma Involving The Urinary Bladder A Study of 6 Cases	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY			English	Article						endometrial neoplasms; bladder neoplasms; stromal sarcoma	GLANDULAR DIFFERENTIATION; UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA; HORMONAL TREATMENT; TUMORS; NEOPLASMS; EXPRESSION; CYTOKERATIN; DISTINCTION	Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) involving the urinary bladder is very rare, with no prior series reported. We identified 6 cases of low-grade ESS involving the bladder at our institution (1998 to 2013), 5 of them consults. The median age at bladder involvement was 60 years (range, 44 to 77 y). One patient presented with bladder involvement at initial diagnosis of ESS. The remaining 5 cases with bladder involvement presented 7 to 30 years (mean 18 y) after a known diagnosis of ESS (n = 2) or after a remote history of hysterectomy with an uncertain diagnosis (n = 3). The location of bladder involvement included dome (n = 1), trigone (n = 2), diffuse (n = 1), and unknown (n = 2). Two cases demonstrated worm-like infiltrating tumor nests classic of low-grade ESS with little stromal reaction with retraction artifact mimicking vascular invasion. One case originating from the ovary showed focal glandular differentiation in the bladder, resembling endometriosis. Two cases had abundant keloidal collagen formation, arranged haphazardly or in a sunburst pattern. One case showed primitive cells infiltrating entirely hyalinized stroma, after chemotherapy given for a misdiagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. CD31 was negative in all cases, except for 1 case with obvious large vessel invasion. The differential diagnosis included a large nested variant of urothelial carcinoma, carcinoid tumor, synovial sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and endometriosis. CD10 was strongly positive in 5 cases, and 1 case had very focal, moderate staining. Estrogen receptor showed strong and diffuse staining in all 6 cases. Progesterone receptor showed moderate to strong staining in 5 cases and focal staining in 1 case. One case showed PAX8 expression, and 2 cases showed p16 nuclear and cytoplasmic expression. CD56 showed weak to strong staining in 4 cases. Two cases had diffuse synaptophysin, and 1 case had focal p63 positivity. GATA-3, CD34, and CD99 were negative in all cases. The Ki-67 index was 1% to 10% (mean 4%). The mitotic count was 0 to 3/10HPF (mean <1/10HPF). Two patients had metastases to pelvic lymph nodes, and 1 had possible lung metastasis. Three patients were treated with Megace and 1 with Arimidex after surgery. Follow-up averaged 19 years (0 to 33 y) after the initial diagnosis of ESS or hysterectomy and 3.5 years (0 to 11 y) after bladder surgery. ESS involving the bladder is extremely rare with a very long interval from onset to bladder involvement. In female patients, low-grade spindle cell lesions involving the bladder should include ESS in the differential diagnosis.

Robust control of Pax3 neural expression is ensured by two redundant sets of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that integrate anterior-posterior (such as Wnt-beta Catenin signaling) as well as dorsal-ventral (such as Shh-Gli signaling) instructive cues. In previous work, we sought to characterize the Wnt-mediated regulation of Pax3 expression and identified the Cdx transcription factors (Cdx1/2/4) as critical intermediates in this process. We identified the neural crest enhancer-2 (NCE2) from the 5'-flanking region of Pax3 as a Cdx-dependent CRM that recapitulates the restricted expression of Pax3 in the mouse caudal neuroectoderm. While this is consistent with a key role in relaying the inductive signal from posteriorizing Wnt ligands, the broad expression of Cdx proteins in the tailbud region is not consistent with the restricted activity of NCE2. This implies that other positive and/or negative inputs are required and, here, we report a novel role for the transcription factor Zic2 in this regulation: Our data strongly suggests that Zic2 is involved in the induction (as a direct Pax3NCE2 activator and Cdx neural cofactor) as well as the maintenance of Pax3 dorsal restriction (as a target of the ventral Shh repressive input). We also provide evidence that the inductive Cdx-Zic2 interaction is integrated on NCE2 with a positive input from the neural-specific transcription factor Sox2. Altogether, our data provide important mechanistic insights into the coordinated integration of different signaling pathways on a short Pax3 CRM. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pulmonary embolism, the most serious form of venous thromboembolism (VTE), leads to the hospitalization or death of over 30 000 Canadians, 225 000 Americans and 300 000 Europeans each year, numbers that have risen over the past decade. Although numerous studies have evaluated optimal approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism, their focus has primarily been on short-term outcomes such as mortality and recurrent VTE in the days, weeks or months after pulmonary embolism diagnosis. However, it is increasingly recognized that pulmonary embolism may have long-lasting sequelae that impact on patients' health. The objective of this article was to review the available evidence on long-term clinical, functional, anatomic and physiologic outcomes after pulmonary embolism, and discuss avenues for research in this field, including the ELOPE Study. Residual pulmonary vascular abnormalities on follow-up imaging and echocardiogram are frequent in pulmonary embolism patients, but the clinical significance of these abnormalities is poorly understood. Whether initial and/or residual clot burden, recurrent pulmonary embolism, altered pulmonary artery or right ventricular hemodynamics or other prognostic factors such as biomarker levels contribute to long-term morbidity after pulmonary embolism is as yet unknown. The ELOPE Study will describe and identify the predictors of long-term outcomes after pulmonary embolism in the setting of a rigorous, multicenter cohort study in which long-term clinical, anatomic, physiologic and functional sequelae such as quality of life, return to work and loss of productivity after pulmonary embolism are systematically evaluated.

These afferent fibers modulate acute and long-term responses of visual neurons to specific stimuli. The present study evaluates whether this cholinergic modulation of visual neurons results in cortical activity and visual perception changes. Awake adult rats were exposed repeatedly for 2 weeks to an orientation-specific grating with or without coupling this visual stimulation to an electrical stimulation of the basal forebrain. The visual acuity, as measured using a visual water maze before and after the exposure to the orientation-specific grating, was increased in the group of trained rats with simultaneous basal forebrain/visual stimulation. The increase in visual acuity was not observed when visual training or basal forebrain stimulation was performed separately or when cholinergic fibers were selectively lesioned prior to the visual stimulation. The visual evoked potentials show a long-lasting increase in cortical reactivity of the primary visual cortex after coupled visual/cholinergic stimulation, as well as c-Fos immunoreactivity of both pyramidal and GABAergic interneuron. These findings demonstrate that when coupled with visual training, the cholinergic system improves visual performance for the trained orientation probably through enhancement of attentional processes and cortical plasticity in V1 related to the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory inputs. This study opens the possibility of establishing efficient rehabilitation strategies for facilitating visual capacity.

In parallel to such structural changes in neuroanatomical organization, development of functional organization may also be associated with cognitive behaviors in children. We examined 6- to 10-year-old children's cortical thickness, functional organization, and cognitive performance. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify areas with cortical thinning, resting-state fMRI to identify functional organization in parallel to cortical development, and working memory/response inhibition tasks to assess executive functioning. We found that neuroanatomical changes in the form of cortical thinning spread over bilateral frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. These regions were engaged in 3 functional networks: sensorimotor and auditory, executive control, and default mode network. Furthermore, we found that working memory and response inhibition only associated with regional functional connectivity, but not topological organization (i.e., local and global efficiency of information transfer) of these functional networks. Interestingly, functional connections associated with "bottom-up" as opposed to "top-down" processing were more clearly related to children's performance on working memory and response inhibition, implying an important role for brain systems involved in late childhood.

BASIS Team	Additive effects of social and non-social attention during infancy relate to later autism spectrum disorder	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							JOINT VISUAL-ATTENTION; CHILDREN; COMMUNICATION; DISENGAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR	Emerging findings from studies with infants at familial high risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), owing to an older sibling with a diagnosis, suggest that those who go on to develop ASD show early impairments in the processing of stimuli with both social and non-social content. Although ASD is defined by social-communication impairments and restricted and repetitive behaviours, the majority of cognitive theories of ASD posit a single underlying factor, which over development has secondary effects across domains. This is the first high-risk study to statistically differentiate theoretical models of the development of ASD in high-risk siblings using multiple risk factors. We examined the prediction of ASD outcome by attention to social and non-social stimuli: gaze following and attentional disengagement assessed at 13 months in low-risk controls and high-risk ASD infants (who were subsequently diagnosed with ASD at 3 years). When included in the same regression model, these 13-month measures independently predicted ASD outcome at 3 years of age. The data were best described by an additive model, suggesting that non-social attention, disengagement, and social attention as evidenced by gaze following, have a cumulative impact on ASD risk. These data argue against cognitive theories of ASD which propose that a single underlying factor has cascading effects across early development leading to an ASD outcome, and support multiple impairment models of ASD that are more consistent with recent genetic and neurobiological evidence.

The availability of efavirenz in a fixed-dose combination makes it very attractive. However, because of (i) adverse events associated with efavirenz, (ii) a poorer overall efficacy of efavirenz compared with newer antiretrovirals, (iii) the ranking of efavirenz as FDA Pregnancy Category D and (iv) the relatively high prevalence of transmitted drug-resistance mutations, there is a need to reconsider the role of efavirenz in first-line ART. We review the available evidence that challenges efavirenz's current position in first-line HIV treatment guidelines. Apart from its animal teratogenic potential, and moderate neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with its use, efavirenz has recently been associated with an increased risk of suicidality when compared with other antiretroviral drugs. Most importantly, efavirenz has demonstrated overall inferior efficacy to various comparator drugs, which include rilpivirine, raltegravir and dolutegravir, in antiretroviral-naive patients. Furthermore, epidemiological data indicate that the prevalence of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance has reached 5%-8% in various parts of the world, and minority transmitted non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance-associated mutations can have a negative impact on the outcome of first-line efavirenz-based ART. Based on considerations of efficacy, toxicity and resistance, it is time to reconsider the routine use of efavirenz in ART. This, of course, presupposes that other antiretrovirals will be available in place of efavirenz, and may not be applicable in certain developing country settings where this is not the case.

Treatment of MDD includes a variety of biopsychosocial approaches. In medical practice, antidepressant drugs are the most common treatment for depressive episodes, and they are among the most prescribed medications in North America2,3. Although antidepressants are clearly effective, particularly for moderate to severe depressive episodes, there is variability in how individuals respond to antidepressant treatment. Failure to respond has individual, economic and social consequences for patients and their families4. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that genes are regulated through the activity of microRNAs (miRNAs), which act as fine-tuners and on-off switches of gene expression5-7. Here we report on complementary studies using postmortem human brain samples, cellular assays and samples from clinical trials of patients with depression and show that miR-1202, a miRNA specific to primates and enriched in the human brain, is differentially expressed in individuals with depression. Additionally, miR-1202 regulates expression of the gene encoding metabotropic glutamate receptor-4 (GRM4) and predicts antidepressant response at baseline. These results suggest that miR-1202 is associated with the pathophysiology of depression and is a potential target for new antidepressant treatments.

IMPACT Investigators	Burden of Seasonal Influenza in Children With Neurodevelopmental Conditions	PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL			English	Article						influenza; children; nervous system diseases; developmental disabilities; seizures	2009 PANDEMIC INFLUENZA; UNITED-STATES; FEBRILE SEIZURES; RISK-FACTORS; COMPLICATIONS; INFECTION; DEATHS	Background: Studies have identified certain neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions (NNC) as risk factors for severe influenza infection. The Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization does not currently recognize children with NNC as having a high risk of complicated influenza infection unless their condition compromises handling of respiratory secretions. We describe the burden of influenza in hospitalized children with NNC, focusing on those without potential airway compromise. Methods: Using multi-year surveillance data obtained by the Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program, Active (IMPACT), we examined presenting signs and symptoms, risk factors and outcomes of children hospitalized with seasonal influenza at 12 Canadian pediatric referral centers. Comparisons were made between children with various NNC and other medical conditions, with and without influenza vaccine indications. The analysis is descriptive with selected comparisons made among groups for important indicators of disease severity. Results: We identified 1991 children hospitalized with influenza over 5 seasons: 293 had NNC, 115 of whom did not have airway compromise or another vaccine indication. The latter group presented with seizures more frequently than those with NNC and a vaccine indication (41.7% vs. 26.4%; P = 0.006) and required intensive care unit admission (20.9% vs. 11.8%; P = 0.02) and mechanical ventilation (14.8% vs. 4.5%; P < 0.001) more often than children without NNC but with a vaccine indication. Conclusions: The burden of influenza infection in children with NNC, even those whose conditions do not obviously compromise respiratory function, is significant. All children with NNC should be recognized as having a high risk of complicated influenza infection and be targeted to receive influenza immunization.

The monolingual listeners exhibited a discrimination pattern that was shaped by their native language experience. The SB listeners, on the other hand, exhibited a MMN pattern that was distinct from both monolingual listener groups, suggesting that the SB pre-attentive system is tuned to access sub-phonemic detail with respect to both input languages, including detail that is not readily accessed by either of their monolingual peers. Additionally, simultaneous bilinguals exhibited sensitivity to language context generated by the standard vowel in the MMN paradigm. The automatic access to fine phonetic detail may aid SB listeners to rapidly adjust their perception to the variable listening conditions that they frequently encounter.

Currently, vulnerability is often understood as an attribute inherent to a participant by nature of a diagnosed condition. Accordingly, a common ethical concern relates to the participant's decisionmaking capacity and ability to provide free and informed consent. We propose an expanded view of vulnerability that moves beyond a focus on consent and the intrinsic attributes of participants. We offer specific suggestions for how relational aspects and the dynamic features of vulnerability could be more fully captured in current discussions and research practices.

Moreover, 26RFa was found to inhibit pancreatic insulin secretion, whereas the role of 43RFa on beta-cell function is unknown, as well as the effects of both peptides on beta-cell survival. Herein, we investigated the effects of 43RFa and 26RFa on survival and apoptosis of pancreatic beta-cells and human pancreatic islets. In addition, we explored the role of these peptides on insulin secretion and the underlying signaling mechanisms. Our results show that in INS-1E beta-cells and human pancreatic islets both 43RFa and 26RFa prevented cell death and apoptosis induced by serum starvation, cytokine synergism, and glucolipotoxicity, through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt- and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2-mediated signaling. Moreover, 43RFa promoted, whereas 26RFa inhibited, glucose-and exendin-4-induced insulin secretion, through G alpha(s) and G alpha(i/o) proteins, respectively. Inhibition of GPR103 expression by small interfering RNA blocked 43RFa insulinotropic effect, but not the insulinostatic action of 26RFa. Finally, 43RFa, but not 26RFa, induced cAMP increase and glucose uptake. In conclusion, because of their survival effects along with the effects on insulin secretion, these findings suggest potential for 43RFa and 26RFa as therapeutic targets in the treatment of diabetes.

MIREC Study Grp	Phthalate and bisphenol A exposure among pregnant women in Canada - Results from the MIREC study	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Biomonitoring; Urine; Bisphenol A; Phthalates; Pregnancy	PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; INNER-CITY COHORT; NEW-YORK-CITY; URINARY CONCENTRATIONS; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; BIRTH OUTCOMES; UNITED-STATES; METABOLITE CONCENTRATIONS; ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS	Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates are endocrine disruptors possibly linked to adverse reproductive and neurodevelopmental outcomes. These chemicals have commonly been measured in urine in population surveys: however, such data are limited for large populations of pregnant women, especially for the critical first trimester of pregnancy. The aim of the study was to measure BPA and phthalate metabolites in first trimester urine samples collected in a large national-scale pregnancy cohort study and to identify major predictors of exposure. Approximately 2000 women were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy from ten sites across Canada. A questionnaire was administered to obtain demographic and socio-economic data on participants and a spot urine sample was collected and analyzed for total BPA (GC-MS/MS) and 11 phthalate metabolites (LC-MS/MS). The geometric mean (GM) maternal urinary concentration of total BPA, uncorrected for specific gravity, was 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.85) mu g/L. Almost 88% of the women had detectable urinary concentrations of BPA. An analysis of urinary concentrations of BPA by maternal characteristics with specific gravity as a covariate in the linear model showed that the geometric mean concentrations: (1) decreased with increasing maternal age, (2) were higher in current smokers or women who quit during pregnancy compared to never smokers, and (3) tended to be higher in women who provided a fasting urine sample and who were born in Canada, and had lower incomes and education. Several of the phthalate metabolites analyzed were not prevalent in this population (MCHP, MMP, MiNP, MOP), with percentages detectable at less than 15%. The phthalate metabolites with the highest measured concentrations were MEP (GM: 32.02 mu g/L) and MnBP (GM: 11.59 mu g/L). MBzP urinary concentrations decreased with maternal age but did not differ by time of urine collection; whereas the DEHP metabolites tended to be higher in older women and when the urine was collected later in the day. This study provides the first biomonitoring results for the largest population of pregnant women sampled in the first trimester of pregnancy. The results indicate that exposure among this population of pregnant women to these chemicals is comparable to or even lower than that observed in a Canadian national population-based survey.

This paper compares 2 MRI methods for visualizing cerebral vasculature and planning DBS probe trajectories: a single data set Ti-weighted scan with double-dose gadolinium contrast (Tlw-Gd) and a multi data set protocol consisting of a Ti-weighted structural, susceptibility-weighted venography, and time-of-flight angiography (T1w-SWI-TOF). Two neurosurgeons who specialize in neuromodulation surgery planned bilateral STN DBS in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (36 hemispheres) using each protocol separately. Planned trajectories were then evaluated across all vascular data sets (Tlw-Gd, SWI, and TOF) to detect possible intersection with blood vessels along the entire path via an objective vesselness measure. The authors' results show that trajectories planned on Tlw-SWI-TOF successfully avoided the cerebral vasculature imaged by conventional T1w-Gd and did not suffer from missing vascular information or imprecise data set registration. Furthermore, with appropriate planning and visualization software, trajectory corridors planned on Tlw-SWI-TOF intersected significantly less fine vasculature that was not detected on the Tlw-Gd (p < 0.01 within 2 mm and p < 0.001 within 4 mm of the track centerline). The proposed Tlw-SWI-TOF protocol comes with minimal effects on the imaging and surgical workflow, improves vessel avoidance, and provides a safe costeffective alternative to injection of gadolinium contrast.

Psychosocial, mental health, and behavioral issues of aging with HIV	CURRENT OPINION IN HIV AND AIDS			English	Review						aging with HIV; coping with HIV; mental health; neurocognitive functioning; social isolation and support	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; OLDER-ADULTS; NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS; INFECTED ADULTS; RISK-FACTORS; HIV/AIDS; POPULATION; STIGMA; AGE	Purpose of review People with HIV continue to live with the health consequences of an episodic illness that limits their ability to fully participate in society, particularly for the growing number of older people living with HIV. The present review describes the recent evidence exploring the psychosocial challenges facing older adults living with HIV. Recent findings Aging for people with HIV may be more challenging than for the general population because of HIV-related stigma, loss of friends and social networks, and the detrimental effects that HIV and antiretroviral treatment have on normal aging processes. Older people with HIV are more likely to experience mental health and neurocognitive impairment than their HIV-negative counterparts, as well as more social isolation as a result of decreased social participation and engagement. People develop different approaches for coping with the challenges associated with aging with HIV. Summary As this field of research evolves, many research gaps need to be addressed, including a better conceptualization and measurement of successful aging and the development of high-quality integrated care, programs, and services tailored to the needs of older people with HIV. A more integrated policy response is needed to improve the psychosocial and economic well being of older people with HIV.

However, the recent identification of a higher incidence of cardiovascular, bone, metabolic, neurocognitive and other aging comorbidities is of major concern and may compromise that ability. The purpose of this review is to focus on the dynamic process of immune remodelling, known as immune senescence, which occurs during HIV infection, and how it impacts on long-term comorbidities. Recent findings Early aging in those with HIV appears to stem from persistent chronic inflammation and residual immune activation despite successful antiretroviral therapy. Multiple similarities exist between the T-cell-senescent phenotypes found in many chronic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including HIV disease, and the elderly. The immune risk phenotype is linked to poor clinical outcomes in the elderly and may also have clinical consequences in those with HIV. Summary Immune senescence results in functional impairments of immunity and a reduced ability to adapt to metabolic stress. Understanding the factors driving the development of immune senescence is critical for the development of strategies to prevent early aging.

We quantified the spatial extent of subpial decreases in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) of cortical gray matter in subjects with multiple sclerosis, as such reductions may indicate regions of cortical demyelination. We exploited the unique geometry of cortical lesions by using two-dimensional parametric surface models of the cortex instead of traditional three-dimensional voxel-wise analyses. MTR images were mapped onto intermediate surfaces between the pial and white matter surfaces and were used to compute differences between secondary-progressive MS (n = 12), relapsing-remitting MS (n = 12), and normal control (n = 12) groups as well as between each individual patient and the normal controls. We identified large regions of significantly reduced cortical MTR in secondary-progressive patients when compared with normal controls. We also identified large regions of reduced cortical MTR in 11 individual patients (8 secondary-progressive, 3 relapsing-remitting). The secondary-progressive patients showed larger areas of abnormally low MTR compared with relapsing-remitting patients both at the group level and on an individual basis. The spatial distributions of abnormal MTR preferentially involved cingulate cortex, insula, and the depths of sulci, in agreement with pathological descriptions of subpial gray matter lesion distribution. These findings suggest that our method is a plausible in vivo imaging technique for quantifying subpial cortical demyelinating lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis and, furthermore, can be applied at the typical clinical field strength of 1.5 T.

Nineteen-Channel Receive Array and Four-Channel Transmit Array Coil for Cervical Spinal Cord Imaging at 7T	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						high-field MRI; RF coil; transmit array; receive array; cervical spinal cord MRI	PHASED-ARRAY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; FAST MRI; RF COIL; TESLA; LESIONS; DESIGN; BRAIN; NMR	Purpose: To design and validate a radiofrequency (RF) array coil for cervical spinal cord imaging at 7T. Methods: A 19-channel receive array with a four-channel transmit array was developed on a close-fitting coil former at 7T. Transmit efficiency and specific absorption rate were evaluated in a B-1(+) mapping study and an electromagnetic model. Receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise amplification for parallel imaging were evaluated and compared with a commercial 3T 19-channel head-neck array and a 7T four-channel spine array. The performance of the array was qualitatively demonstrated in human volunteers using high-resolution imaging (down to 300 mm in-plane). Results: The transmit and receive arrays showed good bench performance. The SNR was approximately 4.2-fold higher in the 7T receive array at the location of the cord with respect to the 3T coil. The g-factor results showed an additional acceleration was possible with the 7T array. In vivo imaging was feasible and showed high SNR and tissue contrast. Conclusion: The highly parallel transmit and receive arrays were demonstrated to be fit for spinal cord imaging at 7T. The high sensitivity of the receive coil combined with ultra-high field will likely improve investigations of microstructure and tissue segmentation in the healthy and pathological spinal cord.

Background Inhalational induction with sevoflurane is the most commonly used technique in young children. However, the effect of sevoflurane on cerebral perfusion has been only studied in adults and children older than 1year. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of sevoflurane anesthesia on brain oxygenation in neonates and infants, using near-infrared spectroscopy. Methods Children younger than 2years, ASA I or II, scheduled for abdominal or orthopedic surgery were included. Induction of anesthesia was started by sevoflurane 6% and maintained with an expired fraction of sevoflurane 3%. Mechanical ventilation was adjusted to maintain an endtidal CO2 around 39mmHg. Brain oxygenation was assessed measuring regional cerebral saturation of oxygen (rSO2c), measured by NIRS while awake and 15min after induction, under anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) variation was recorded. Results Hundred and ninety-five children were included. Anesthesia induced a significant decrease in MAP (-27%). rSO2c increased significantly after induction (+18%). Using children age for subgroup analysis, we found that despite MAP reduction, rSO2c increase was significant but smaller in children 6months than in children >6months (6months: rSO2c=+13%, >6months: rSO2c=+22%; P<0.0001). Interindividual comparison showed that, during anesthesia at steady-state with comparable CMRO2, rSO2c values were significantly higher when MAP was above 36mmHg. And the higher the absolute MAP value during anesthesia was, the higher the rSO2c was. We observed a rSO2c variation 0 in 21 patients among the 195 studied, and the majority of these patients were younger than 6months (n=19). No increase or decrease of rSO2c during anesthesia despite reduction of CMRO2 can be explained by a reduction of oxygen supply. Using the ROC curves, we determined that the threshold value of MAP under anesthesia, associated with rSO2c variation 0%, was 39mmHg in all the studied population (AUC: 0.90 +/- 0.02; P<0.001). In children younger than 6months, this value of MAP was 33mmHg, and 43mmHg in children older than 6months. Conclusion Despite a significant decrease of MAP, 1 MAC of sevoflurane induced a significant increase in regional brain oxygenation. But subgroup analysis showed that MAP decrease had a greater impact on brain oxygenation, in children younger than 6months. According to our results, MAP value during anesthesia should not go under 33mmHg in children 6months and 43mmHg in children >6months, as further changes in MAP, PaCO2 or hemoglobin during anesthesia may be poorly tolerated by the brain.

J	Cote, S; Wei, GH; Mousseau, N				Cote, Sebastien; Wei, Guanghong; Mousseau, Normand			Atomistic mechanisms of huntingtin N-terminal fragment insertion on a phospholipid bilayer revealed by molecular dynamics simulations	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Huntingtin protein; Huntington's disease; httNTQN monomer; peptide-membrane interactions; all-atom explicit solvent simulations	NEURONAL INTRANUCLEAR INCLUSIONS; MEMBRANE-ACTIVE PEPTIDES; PARTICLE MESH EWALD; ATOM FORCE-FIELD; POLYGLUTAMINE PEPTIDES; LIPID-BILAYERS; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; ION CHANNELS; MEDIATED AGGREGATION; CHAIN-LENGTH	The huntingtin protein is characterized by a segment of consecutive glutamines (Q(N)) that is responsible for its fibrillation. As with other amyloid proteins, misfolding of huntingtin is related to Huntington's disease through pathways that can involve interactions with phospholipid membranes. Experimental results suggest that the N-terminal 17-amino-acid sequence (htt(NT)) positioned just before the Q(N) region is important for the binding of huntingtin to membranes. Through all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, we unveil the structure and dynamics of the htt(NT)Q(N) fragment on a phospholipid membrane at the atomic level. We observe that the insertion dynamics of this peptide can be described by four main stepsapproach, reorganization, anchoring, and insertionthat are very diverse at the atomic level. On the membrane, the htt(NT) peptide forms a stable -helix essentially parallel to the membrane with its nonpolar side-chainsmainly Leu-4, Leu-7, Phe-11 and Leu-14positioned in the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Salt-bridges involving Glu-5, Glu-12, Lys-6, and Lys-15, as well as hydrogen bonds involving Thr-3 and Ser-13 with the phospholipids also stabilize the structure and orientation of the htt(NT) peptide. These observations do not significantly change upon adding the Q(N) region whose role is rather to provide, through its hydrogen bonds with the phospholipids' head group, a stable scaffold facilitating the partitioning of the htt(NT) region in the membrane. Moreover, by staying accessible to the solvent, the amyloidogenic Q(N) region could also play a key role for the oligomerization of htt(NT)Q(N) on phospholipid membranes. Proteins 2014; 82:1409-1427.

Molecular aspects of hereditary spastic paraplegia	EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH			English	Review						Hereditary spastic paraplegia; Spasticity; Motor neuron; Pathways; Neurogenetics	MUTATIONS; GENE; MOTOR; MECHANISMS; NEUROPATHY; FORM; DISORDER; DDHD2; SPG6	Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive lower limbs spasticity and weakness. What was first thought to be a small group of rare Mendelian disorder has now become a large group that includes many complex syndromes. While large families with defined modes of inheritance were used for the initial HSP gene discovery, new sequencing technologies have recently allowed the study of small families, with the identification of many new disease causative genes. These discoveries are slowly leading to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HSP with the identification of precise disease pathways. These insights may lead to new therapeutic strategies for what is a group of largely untreatable diseases. This review looks at the key players involved in HSP and where they act in their specific pathways. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In auditory processing, self-initiated sounds evoke a smaller brain response than passive sound exposure of the same sound sequence. Previous work suggests that this response attenuation reflects a predictive mechanism to differentiate the sensory consequences of one's own actions from other sensory input, which seems to form the basis for the sense of agency (recognizing oneself as the agent of the movement). This study addresses the question whether attenuation of brain responses to self-initiated sounds can be explained by brain activity involved in movement planning rather than movement execution. We recorded ERPs in response to sounds initiated by button presses. In one condition, participants moved a finger to press the button voluntarily, whereas in another condition, we initiated a similar, but involuntary, finger movement by stimulating the corresponding region of the primary motor cortex with TMS. For involuntary movements, no movement intention (and no feeling of agency) could be formed; thus, no motor plans were available to the forward model. A portion of the brain response evoked by the sounds, the N1-P2 complex, was reduced in amplitude following voluntary, self-initiated movements, but not following movements initiated by motor cortex stimulation. Our findings demonstrate that movement intention and the corresponding feeling of agency determine sensory attenuation of brain responses to self-initiated sounds. The present results support the assumptions of a predictive internal forward model account operating before primary motor cortex activation.

This prospective observational study in 51 intensive care units (ICUs) included all patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) over a two-week period during 2008-2009. We included 712 patients representing 3,620 patient-days. Median MV duration was 3.0 days (interquartile range 2-6). During MV, 92% of patients received analgo-sedation, 32% an adjunct agent (e.g., acetaminophen), 18% NMBDs, and 10% antipsychotics. Opioids were used more frequently than benzodiazepines or propofol (84.8% vs 62.2% vs 10.1% patients, respectively, P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of opioid and benzodiazepine use were a longer MV duration, assessment scales, physical restraints, and university-affiliated hospital. Although more than 50% of ICUs reported that assessment tools, protocols, and daily sedation interruption (DSI) were available for use, application was modest: sedation scale 53.0%, pain scale 19.1%, delirium scale 5.2%, protocol 25.0%, DSI 42.1%. Accidental device removal occurred in 4.6% of patients, with 75.8% of events during DSI. Daily sedation interruption was associated with protocol use, physical restraints, university-affiliated hospital, and short-duration MV. Variables associated with protocol use included assessment scales, longer MV duration, lack of physical restraints, and admission to a community hospital. Nearly all MV patients received analgo-sedation. Opioids were used more often than sedatives despite infrequent use of pain scales. Few patients received antipsychotic therapy, but physical restraint was common. Protocol use was poor compared to DSI. Duration of MV predicted the use of either.

Stress and glucocorticoids have been shown to alter TrkB signaling in neurons, and defects in TrkB expression have been reported in the prefrontal cortex of suicide subjects. Glucocorticoid treatment has been shown to induce deleterious effects on the neuronal maturation. However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of TrkB by glucocorticoid during neurodevelopment are not clear. Here we show that acute corticosterone exposure induced post translational upregulation of TrkB in primary cortical neurons (days in vitro 4, DIV4), which was blocked by the proteasome inhibitors. Acute corticosterone-induced increase in TrkB protein levels was dependent on glucocorticoid receptor (GR). At the cellular level, ubiquitin E3 ligase c-Cbl mediates TrkB stabilization and corticosterone-induced TrkB levels. Moreover, the tyrosine kinase binding domain in c-Cbl plays a critical role in corticosterone-induced TrkB levels. Chronic treatment of neurons with corticosterone induced significant decreases in both TrkB and c-Cbl protein levels. Acute corticosterone treatment failed to induce any significant change in TrkB and c-Cbl protein levels in mature neurons (DIV 12), where as chronic corticosterone exposure reduced TrkB levels. Under an in vivo condition, chronic corticosterone exposure induced down-regulation of c-Cbl in mouse frontal cortex and hippocampus. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time a significant decrease in c-Cbl mRNA Levels in the prefrontal cortex of suicide subjects indicating the possible role of c-Cbl in the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior. Thus, ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated TrkB regulation may be an important mechanism for improving BDNF signaling and maintaining neuroplasticity in stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

The present study aims to assess if these neurochemical and neurophysiological alterations are persistent and linked to M1 cortical thickness. Methods: Sixteen active football players who sustained their last concussion, on average, three years prior to testing and 14 active football players who never sustained a concussion were recruited for a single session of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Measures of M1 and whole brain cortical thickness were acquired, and H-1-MRS data were acquired from left M1 using a MEGA-PRESS sequence. Cortical silent period (CSP) and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) were measured with TMS applied over left M1. Results: No significant group differences were observed for metabolic concentrations, TMS measures, and cortical thickness. However, whereas GABA and glutamate levels were positively correlated in control athletes, this relationship was absent in concussed athletes. Conclusion: These data suggest the general absence of neurophysiologic, neurometabolic and neuroanatomical disruptions in M1 three years following the last concussive event. However, correlational analyses suggest the presence of a slight metabolic imbalance between GABA and glutamate concentrations in the primary motor cortex of concussed athletes. Significance: The present study highlights the importance of multimodal assesments of the impacts of sport concussions. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Here, we analyzed the occurrence of interictal spikes and high frequency oscillations (HFOs; ripples: 80-200 Hz and fast ripples: 250-500 Hz) from 48 h before to 96 h after the first seizure in the rat pilocarpine model of MTLE. Interictal spikes recorded with depth EEG electrodes from the hippocampus CA3 area and entorhinal cortex (EC) were classified as type 1 (characterized by a spike followed by a wave) or type 2 (characterized by a spike with no wave). We found that: (i) there was a switch in the distribution of both types of interictal spikes before and after the occurrence of the first seizure; during the latent phase both types of interictal spikes predominated in the EC whereas during the chronic phase both types of spikes predominated in CA3; (ii) type 2 spike duration decreased in both regions from the latent to the chronic phase; (iii) type 2 spikes associated to fast ripples occurred at higher rates in EC compared to CA3 during the latent phase while they occurred at similar rates in both regions in the chronic phase; and (iv) rates of fast ripples outside of spikes were higher in EC compared to CA3 during the latent phase. Our findings demonstrate that the transition from the latent to the chronic phase is paralleled by dynamic changes in interictal spike and HFO expression in EC and CA3. We propose that these changes may represent biomarkers of epileptogenicity in MTLE. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

[TAL1B5] and HLA-DR/DQ/DP beta [CR3/43]) and astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, and heat shock protein-27) in homogenates of autopsied brain of chronic methamphetamine users (n = 20) and matched controls (n = 23). Intact protein levels of all markers were, as expected, elevated (+28%-1270%, P< 0.05) in putamen of patients with the neurodegenerative disorder multiple system atrophy (as a positive control) as were concentrations of fragments of glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin and heat shock protein-27 (+170%-4700%, P< 0.005). In contrast, intact protein concentrations of the markers were normal in dopamine-rich striatum (caudate, putamen) and in the frontal cortex of the drug users. However, striatal levels of cleaved vimentin and heat shock protein-27 were increased (by 98%-211%, P< 0.05), with positive correlations (r = 0.41-0.60) observed between concentrations of truncated heat shock protein-27 and extent of dopamine loss (P = 0.006) and levels of lipid peroxidation products 4-hydroxynonenal (P = 0.046) and malondialdehyde (P = 0.11). Our failure to detect increased intact protein levels of commonly used markers of microgliosis and astrogliosis could be explained by exposure to methamphetamine insufficient to cause a toxic process associated with overt gliosis; however, about half of the subjects had died of drug intoxication suggesting that "high" drug doses might have been used. Alternatively, drug tolerance to toxic effects might have occurred in the subjects, who were all chronic methamphetamine users. Nevertheless, the finding of above-normal levels of striatal vimentin and heat shock protein-27 fragments (which constituted 10-28% of the intact protein), for which changes in the latter correlated with those of several markers possibly suggestive of damage, does suggest that some astrocytic "disturbance" had occurred, which might in principle be related to methamphetamine neurotoxicity or to a neuroplastic remodeling process. Taken together, our neurochemical findings do not provide strong evidence for either marked microgliosis or astrogliosis in at least a subgroup of human recreational methamphetamine users who used the drug chronically and shortly before death. However, a logistically more difficult quantitative histopathological study is needed to confirm whether glial changes occur or do not occur in brain of human methamphetamine (and amphetamine) users.

However, mechanisms underpinning the emergence of scalp fast oscillations, and whether they differ from those of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs), are yet to be understood. The visibility of cortical electric activity on scalp EEG recordings is dependent on two factors: the characteristics of the cortical generator and the background level. We studied this issue using scalp EEG recordings and detailed simulations, with a finite element model including 8 million elements and 8 different tissues. We observed an almost linear relationship between the amplitude of scalp electric potential and the extent of the generator on the cortex. However, this relationship is subject to substantial variability, with variations in factors greater than 3 occurring simply by changing the location on the cortex of generators of fixed extent. In addition, we showed that the background power in scalp EEG recordings decreases at higher frequency bands, being inversely proportional to a power of 2.5 of the frequency. In the specific case of fast oscillations, they can be detected within the lower noise level of the ripple band (80-200 Hz) even though their median amplitude on scalp EEG recordings is more than 10 times smaller than IEDs and consistent with cortical generators of approximately 1 cm(2). In conclusion, the physics governing the propagation of electrical activity from the brain to the scalp are consistent with the hypothesis that scalp fast oscillations and intracranial high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500 Hz) are expressions of common generators. Given the potential role of HFOs as biomarkers in epilepsy, the possibility to obtain some of the associated information from scalp EEG is of high clinical significance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We focused on brain activity that increased with the number of items effectively held in memory by the participants during the retention interval of an auditory memory task. We used very simple acoustic materials (i.e., pure tones that varied in pitch) that minimized activation from non-ASTM related systems. MEG revealed neural activity in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices that increased with a greater number of items effectively held in memory by the participants during the maintenance of pitch representations in ASTM. The present results reinforce the functional role of frontal and temporal cortices in the retention of pitch information in ASTM. This is the first MEG study to provide both fine spatial localization and temporal resolution on the neural mechanisms of non-verbal ASTM for pitch in relation to individual differences in the capacity of ASTM. This research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms mediating the representation and maintenance of basic non-verbal auditory features in the human brain.

Despite its small size, its volume can be quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Here, we study a cohort of 962 typically developing adolescents from the Saguenay Youth Study and estimate pituitary volumes using a newly developed multi-atlas segmentation method known as the MAGeT Brain algorithm. We found that age and puberty stage (controlled for age) each predicts adjusted pituitary volumes (controlled for total brain volume) in both males and females. Controlling for the effects of age and puberty stage, total testosterone and estradiol levels also predict adjusted pituitary volumes in males and pre-menarche females, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the pituitary gland grows during adolescence, and its volume relates to circulating plasma-levels of sex steroids in both males and females. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A utility concession curve data fitting model for quantitative analysis of negotiation styles	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Utility concession curve; Negotiation style; Reciprocal function; Data fitting; Data mining; Negotiations	AUTOMATED NEGOTIATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; NEURAL-NETWORKS; AGENTS; INFORMATION; SOFTWARE; SUPPORT; DESIGN	A reciprocal function is proposed for defining the utility concession curve of a negotiation participant. The curve has only one free parameter and can fit the complete range of negotiation styles from extremely competitive to extremely collaborative. Various equations are derived, including the definition of a utility concession curve center which permits intuitive quantifying of a utility concession curve. Subsequently, an optimization model is proposed to fit the curve to a set of offers. Using the proposed model, a set of negotiations is mined for utility concession curves which are then used for clustering and hypothesis testing. Three negotiations styles seem to emerge from the data; slightly collaborative, neutral and quite competitive. It is also shown quantitatively that the level of competitiveness of the counterpart is negatively correlated with the agreement rate, and this is validated against the experimental treatment. Additionally, by the use of an experimental treatment, it is shown that the level of competitiveness of the counterpart has a positive causal impact on the negotiator's style, causing him to become more competitive or collaborative. The data fitting model can also be used for incrementally fitting the curve in real-time during a negotiation to provide an estimate of the negotiation style which may help in the negotiation process.

In an extension to our previous voxel-based morphometry findings, we employed a more specific, vertex-based approach to explore cortical thinning in relation to persistent negative symptoms (PNS) in non-affective first-episode of psychosis (FEP) patients to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of primary negative symptoms. Methods: This study included 62 non-affective FEP patients and 60 non-clinical controls; 16 patients were identified with PNS (i.e., at least 1 primary negative symptom at moderate or greater severity sustained for at least 6 consecutive months). Using cortical thickness analyses, we explored for differences between PNS and non-PNS patients as well as between each patient group and healthy controls; cut-off threshold was set at p<0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons. Results: A thinner cortex prominently in the right superior temporal gyrus extending into the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), right parahippocampal gyrus, and left orbital frontal gyrus was identified in PNS patients vs. non-PNS patients. Compared with healthy controls, PNS patients showed a thinner cortex prominently in the right superior temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and right cingulate; non-PNS patients showed a thinner cortex prominently in the parahippocampal gyrus bi-laterally. Conclusion: Cortical thinning in the early stages of non-affective psychosis is present in the frontal and temporo-parietal regions in patients with PNS. With these brain regions strongly related to social cognitive functioning, our finding suggests a potential link between primary negative symptoms and social cognitive deficits through common brain etiologies.

Indeed, some older individuals seem to use compensatory mechanisms to maintain a high level of performance when submitted to lexical tasks. However, how these mechanisms affect cortical and subcortical activity during semantic and phonological processing has not been extensively explored. The purpose of this study was to look at the effect of healthy aging on cortico-subcortical routes related to semantic and phonological processing using a lexical analogue of the Wisconsin Cart-Sorting Task. Our results indicate that while young adults tend to show increased activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the fusiform gyrus, the ventral temporal lobe and the caudate nucleus during semantic decisions and in the posterior Broca's area (area 44), the temporal lobe (area 37), the temporoparietal junction (area 40) and the motor cortical regions during phonological decisions, older individuals showed increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and motor cortical regions during both semantic and phonological decisions. Furthermore, when semantic and phonological decisions were contrasted with each other, younger individuals showed significant brain activity differences in several regions while older individuals did not. Therefore, in older individuals, the semantic and phonological routes seem to merge into a single pathway. These findings represent most probably neural reserve/compensation mechanisms, characterized by a decrease in specificity, on which the elderly rely to maintain an adequate level of performance.

Our purpose is to provide further evidence on these possible associations. Methods: We conducted a set of case-control studies in three Canadian cities, Montreal, Ottawa and Vancouver. The study included 166 subjects with glioma, 93 subjects with meningioma, and 648 population-based controls. A lifetime history of cigarette smoking was collected and various smoking indices were computed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) between smoking and each of the two types of brain tumours. Results: Adjusted ORs between smoking and each type of brain tumour were not significantly elevated for all smokers combined or for smokers with over 15 pack-years ((packs/day) x years) accumulated. We tested for interactions between smoking and several sociodemographic variables; the interaction between smoking and education on glioma risk was significant, with smoking showing an elevated OR among subjects with lower education and an OR below unity among subjects with higher education. Conclusion: Except for an unexplained and possibly artefactual excess risk in one population subgroup, we found little or no evidence of an association between smoking and either glioma or meningioma.

The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown but store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) components participate in calcium homeostasis, potentially playing a significant role in chronic pain pathologies. Most G protein-coupled receptors activated by inflammatory mediators trigger calcium-dependent signaling pathways and stimulate SOCE in primary afferents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of TRPC3, a calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel coupled to phospholipase C and highly expressed in DRG, as a link between activation of pro-inflammatory metabotropic receptors and SOCE in nociceptive pathways. Results: Using in situ hybridization, we determined that TRPC3 and TRPC1 constitute the major TRPC subunits expressed in adult rat DRG. TRPC3 was found localized exclusively in small and medium diameter sensory neurons. Heterologous overexpression of TRPC3 channel subunits in cultured primary DRG neurons evoked a significant increase of Gd3+-sensitive SOCE following thapsigargin-induced calcium store depletion. Conversely, using the same calcium add-back protocol, knockdown of endogenous TRPC3 with shRNA-mediated interference or pharmacological inhibition with the selective TRPC3 antagonist Pyr10 induced a substantial decrease of SOCE, indicating a significant role of TRPC3 in SOCE in DRG nociceptors. Activation of P2Y2 purinoceptors or PAR2 protease receptors triggered a strong increase in intracellular calcium in conditions of TRPC3 overexpression. Additionally, knockdown of native TRPC3 or its selective pharmacological blockade suppressed UTP-or PAR2 agonist-evoked calcium responses as well as sensitization of DRG neurons. These data show a robust link between activation of pro-inflammatory receptors and calcium homeostasis through TRPC3-containing channels operating both in receptor-and store-operated mode. Conclusions: Our findings highlight a major contribution of TRPC3 to neuronal calcium homeostasis in somatosensory pathways based on the unique ability of these cation channels to engage in both SOCE and receptor-operated calcium influx. This is the first evidence for TRPC3 as a SOCE component in DRG neurons. The flexible role of TRPC3 in calcium signaling as well as its functional coupling to pro-inflammatory metabotropic receptors involved in peripheral sensitization makes it a potential target for therapeutic strategies in chronic pain conditions.

Kainate Receptors Coexist in a Functional Complex with KCC2 and Regulate Chloride Homeostasis in Hippocampal Neurons	CELL REPORTS			English	Article							ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT REGULATION; CL COTRANSPORTER KCC2; MOSSY FIBER SYNAPSES; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; SUBUNIT; NEUROTRANSMISSION; INHIBITION; PROTEINS; DISEASE; PAIN	KCC2 is the neuron-specific K+-Cl- cotransporter required for maintaining low intracellular Cl-, which is essential for fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mature CNS. Despite the requirement of KCC2 for inhibitory synaptic transmission, understanding of the cellular mechanisms that regulate KCC2 expression and function is rudimentary. We examined KCC2 in its native protein complex in vivo to identify key KCC2-interacting partners that regulate KCC2 function. Using blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), we determined that native KCC2 exists in a macromolecular complex with kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs). We found that KAR subunits are required for KCC2 oligomerization and surface expression. In accordance with this finding, acute and chronic genetic deletion of KARs decreased KCC2 function and weakened synaptic inhibition in hippocampal neurons. Our results reveal KARs as regulators of KCC2, significantly advancing our growing understanding of the tight interplay between excitation and inhibition.

Evidence for a Role for the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Disengaging from an Incorrect Action	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; RESPONSE CONFLICT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FINGER MOVEMENTS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; NEURAL SYSTEM; HUMANS; COMPONENTS	Adjusting for an error requires both disengaging from the wrong course of action and initiating a corrective response. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been implicated in both these processes in the decision-making and action monitoring literatures. Here, we aimed to distinguish between these putative functions with a variant of the Eriksen flanker task that manipulated response requirements (i.e. one or two finger responses). We found that two event-related potentials originating from the dACC (error-related negativity (ERN) and anterior N2) only reflected the representation of the incorrect response: these waveforms were larger when the incorrect response involved two fingers rather than one finger. The increase in ERN magnitude was also accompanied by a reduction in spontaneous error corrections. These results argue that activity in the dACC reflects a process involved in disengaging from an ongoing incorrect action, clearing the way for the correct response.

Normally, these excitatory cholinergic-nicotinic synapses produce large suprathreshold EPSPs on sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons to convey signals from the CNS. However, in certain disease states, synaptic transmission in autonomic ganglia is depressed and the periphery becomes deregulated. For example, previous work demonstrated that hyperglycemia depresses EPSPs on sympathetic neurons and disrupts sympathetic reflexes by causing an ROS-dependent inactivation of the postsynaptic nAChRs. What is not clear, however, is whether some autonomic neurons are more vulnerable to hyperglycemia than others. One possibility is that sympathetic neurons may be more prone than cholinergic parasympathetic neurons to hyperglycemia-induced elevations in cytosolic ROS because sympathetic neurons contain several pro-oxidant molecules involved in noradrenaline metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we recorded synaptic transmission from different mouse sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, as well as from the adrenal medulla. In addition, we used cellular imaging to measure hyperglycemia-induced changes in cytosolic ROS and whole-cell recordings to measure the use-dependent rundown of ACh-evoked currents. Our results demonstrate that hyperglycemia depresses synaptic transmission on sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells and elevates cytosolic ROS. Conversely, hyperglycemia has little effect on synaptic transmission at synapses on parasympathetic neurons. We conclude that sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells are more vulnerable to diabetes than parasympathetic neurons, a finding that may have implications for both long-term diabetic autonomic neuropathies and insulin-induced hypoglycemia, a serious complication of diabetes.

Recently, memory reconsolidation was suggested to reinforce or integrate new information into reactivated memory. Here, we show that reactivated inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory is enhanced through reconsolidation under conditions in which memory extinction is not induced. This memory enhancement is mediated by neurons in the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) through the simultaneous activation of calcineurin-induced proteasome-dependent protein degradation and cAMP responsive element binding protein-mediated gene expression. Interestingly, the amygdala is required for memory reconsolidation and enhancement, whereas the hippocampus and mPFC are required for only memory enhancement. Furthermore, memory enhancement triggered by retrieval utilizes distinct mechanisms to strengthen IA memory by additional learning that depends only on the amygdala. Our findings indicate that reconsolidation functions to strengthen the original memory and show the dynamic nature of reactivated memory through protein degradation and gene expression in multiple brain regions.

Resting GABA and glutamate concentrations do not predict visual gamma frequency or amplitude	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							EXCITATION-INHIBITION BALANCE; AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; EVOKED-RESPONSES; MR SPECTROSCOPY; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MODULATION; MECHANISMS	Gamma band oscillations arise in neuronal networks of interconnected GABAergic interneurons and excitatory pyramidal cells. A previous study found a correlation between visual gamma peak frequency, as measured with magnetoencephalography, and resting GABA levels, as measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), in 12 healthy volunteers. If true, this would allow studies in clinical populations testing modulation of this relationship, but this finding has not been replicated. We addressed this important question by measuring gamma oscillations and GABA, as well as glutamate, in 50 healthy volunteers. Visual gamma activity was evoked using an established gratings paradigm, and we applied a beamformer spatial filtering technique to extract source- reconstructed gamma peak frequency and amplitude from the occipital lobe. We determined gamma peak frequency and amplitude from the location with maximal activation and from the location of the MRS voxel to assess the relationship of GABA with gamma. Gamma peak frequency was estimated from the highest value of the raw spectra and by a Gaussian fit to the spectra. MRS data were acquired from occipital cortex. We did not replicate the previously found correlation between gamma peak frequency and GABA concentration. Calculation of a Bayes factor provided strong evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. We also did not find a correlation between gamma activity and glutamate or between gamma and the ratio of GABA/glutamate. Our results suggest that cortical gamma oscillations do not have a consistent, demonstrable relationship to excitatory/inhibitory network activity as proxied by MRS measurements of GABA and glutamate.

Subsequently, these vacuoles disappear in parallel with the reappearance of new SVs. We have used synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double knock-out neurons, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis is dramatically impaired, to gain insight into the poorly understood mechanisms underlying this process. Massive formation of bulk endosomes was not defective, but rather enhanced, in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The subsequent conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin coated buds on their surface and this process proceeded even after further clathrin knock-down, suggesting its independence of clathrin.

Recently, the U.S. NIMH has elaborated this vision through a new framework for mental health research, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). This framework aims to orient mental health research toward the discovery of underlying neurobiological and biobehavioral mechanisms of mental disorders that will eventually lead to definitive treatments. In this article we consider the rationale of the RDoC and what it reveals about implicit models of mental disorders. As an overall framework for understanding mental disorders, RDoC is impoverished and conceptually flawed. These limitations are not accidental but stem from disciplinary commitments and interests that are at odds with the larger concerns of psychiatry. A multilevel, ecosocial approach to biobehavioral systems is needed both to guide relevant neuroscience research and insure the inclusion of social processes that may be fundamental contributors to psychopathology and recovery.

Design, implementation, and evaluation of a knowledge translation intervention to increase organ donation after cardiocirculatory death in Canada: a study protocol	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							INTERRUPTED TIME-SERIES; SAMPLE-SIZE; HEALTH; FRAMEWORK; BEHAVIOR	Background: A shortage of transplantable organs is a global problem. There are two types of organ donation: living and deceased. Deceased organ donation can occur following neurological determination of death (NDD) or cardiocirculatory death. Donation after cardiocirculatory death (DCD) accounts for the largest increments in deceased organ donation worldwide. Variations in the use of DCD exist, however, within Canada and worldwide. Reasons for these discrepancies are largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-based knowledge translation intervention to provide practical guidance about how to increase the numbers of DCD organ donors without reducing the numbers of standard NDD donors. Methods: We will use a mixed method three-step approach. In step one, we will conduct semi-structured interviews, informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, to identify and describe stakeholders' beliefs and attitudes about DCD and their perceptions of the multi-level factors that influence DCD. We will identify: determinants of the evidence-practice gap; specific behavioural changes and/or process changes needed to increase DCD; specific group(s) of clinicians or organizations (e.g., provincial donor organizations) in need of behaviour change; and specific targets for interventions. In step two, using the principles of intervention mapping, we will develop a theory-based knowledge translation intervention that encompasses behavior change techniques to overcome the identified barriers and enhance the enablers to DCD. In step three, we will roll out the intervention in hospitals across the 10 Canadian provinces and evaluate its effectiveness using a multiple interrupted time series design. Discussion: We will adopt a behavioural approach to define and test novel, theory-based, and ethically-acceptable knowledge translation strategies to increase the numbers of available DCD organ donors in Canada. If successful, this study will ultimately lead to more transplantations, reducing patient morbidity and mortality at a population-level.

SEROTONIN MODULATES ELECTROSENSORY PROCESSING AND BEHAVIOR VIA 5-HT2-LIKE RECEPTORS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neural coding; weakly electric fish; neuromodulation; neuroethology	WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH; LATERAL-LINE LOBE; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; GYMNOTIFORM FISH; COMMUNICATION SIGNALS; ISOLATED SPIKES; 5-HT RECEPTORS; PROTEIN-KINASE; K+ CHANNELS; NEURONS	Efficient sensory processing of the environment is a critical function for any organism to survive and is accomplished by having neurons adapt their responses to stimuli based on behavioral context in part through neuromodulators such as serotonin (5-HT). We have recently shown that one critical function of the serotonergic system in weakly electric fish is to enhance sensory pyramidal neuron responses within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) to stimuli caused by same sex conspecifics, thereby enhancing their perception. This enhancement is accomplished by making pyramidal neurons more excitable through downregulation of potassium channels. However, the nature of the 5-HT receptors that mediate this effect is not known. Here we show that the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (ket) can effectively block the effects of 5-HT on pyramidal neuron excitability in vitro. Indeed, 5-HT application subsequent to ket application did not cause any significant changes in neuron excitability and responses to current injection. We further show that ket applied in vivo can block the effects of 5-HT on behavioral responses. Thus, our results strongly suggest that the previously observed effects of 5-HT on sensory processing within ELL and their consequences for behavior are mediated by 5-HT2 receptors. (C) 2014 IBRO.

Here we collected brain structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 34 SIVD patients and 35 healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM), cortical thickness (and surface area) analysis and deep gray matter volume measurements were performed. VBM analysis showed gray matter volume reduction in lateral and medial temporal lobes, as well as orbitofrontal cortex in SIVD patients. The surface-based analyses revealed more subtle structural differences in the perisylvian area, medial temporal lobe, anterior and posterior cingulate, as well as prefrontal areas. Furthermore, analyses of deep gray matter demonstrated significant atrophy of the hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens and other nuclei. Finally, we found that thinning in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the volume decline in thalamus, caudate nucleus and amygdala was correlated with the cognitive impairment in patients. In conclusion, our study showed the structural abnormalities of the hippocampus and its associated outflow areas, as well as cortices implicated in cholinergic circuits in SIVD. These findings may bring new insights into the dysfunction of brain gray matter in SIVD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When the brain is deprived of one sensory modality, plasticity becomes compensatory: the exception that invalidates the general loss hypothesis giving the opportunity of effective change. Sensory deprivation comes with massive alterations in brain structure and function, behavioral outcomes, and neural interactions. Blind individuals do as good as the sighted and even more, show superior abilities in auditory, tactile and olfactory processing. This behavioral enhancement is accompanied with changes in occipital cortex function, where visual areas at different levels become responsive to non-visual information. The intact senses are in general used more efficiently in the blind but are also used more exclusively. New findings are disentangling these two aspects of compensatory plasticity. What is due to visual deprivation and what is dependent on the extended use of spared modalities? The latter seems to contribute highly to compensatory changes in the congenitally blind. Short-term deprivation through the use of blindfolds shows that cortical excitability of the visual cortex is likely to show rapid modulatory changes after few minutes of light deprivation and therefore changes are possible in adulthood. However, reorganization remains more pronounced in the congenitally blind. Cortico-cortical pathways between visual areas and the areas of preserved sensory modalities are inhibited in the presence of vision, but are unmasked after loss of vision or blindfolding as a mechanism likely to drive cross-modal information to the deafferented visual cortex. The development of specialized higher order visual pathways independently from early sensory experience is likely to preserve their function and switch to the intact modalities. Plasticity in the blind is also accompanied with neurochemical and morphological changes; both intrinsic connectivity and functional coupling at rest are altered but are likewise dependent on different sensory experience and training.

Invasive candidiasis in low birth weight preterm infants: risk factors, clinical course and outcome in a prospective multicenter study of cases and their matched controls	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Invasive candidiasis; Neurodevelopmental outcome; Risk factors; Neonatal; Prematurity	NEONATAL CANDIDIASIS; ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY; INTENSIVE-CARE; INFECTION; NETWORK	Background: This multicenter prospective study of invasive candidiasis (IC) was carried out to determine the risk factors for, incidence of, clinical and laboratory features, treatment and outcome of IC in infants of birth weight < 1250 g. Methods: Neonates < 1250 g with IC and their matched controls (2: 1) were followed longitudinally and descriptive analysis was performed. Survivors underwent neurodevelopmental assessment at 18 to 24 months corrected age. Neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) was defined as blindness, deafness, moderate to severe cerebral palsy, or a score < 70 on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development 2nd edition. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine risk factors for IC and predictors of mortality and NDI. Results: Cumulative incidence rates of IC were 4.2%, 2.2% and 1.5% for birth-weight categories < 750 g, < 1000 g, < 1500 g, respectively. Forty nine infants with IC and 90 controls were enrolled. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) was the only independent risk factor for IC (p = 0.03). CNS candidiasis occurred in 50% of evaluated infants, while congenital candidiasis occurred in 31%. Infants with CNS candidiasis had a higher mortality rate (57%) and incidence of deafness (50%) than the overall cohort of infants with IC. NDI (56% vs. 33%; p = 0.017) and death (45% vs. 7%; p = 0.0001) were more likely in cases than in controls, respectively. IC survivors were more likely to be deaf (28% vs. 7%; p = 0.01). IC independently predicted mortality (p = 0.0004) and NDI (p = 0.018). Conclusion: IC occurred in 1.5% of VLBW infants. Preceding NEC increased the risk of developing IC. CNS candidiasis is under-investigated and difficult to diagnose, but portends a very poor outcome. Mortality, deafness and NDI were independently significantly increased in infants with IC compared to matched controls.

Neglect is characterized by reduced awareness of stimuli presented on patients' contralesional side of space. Inspired by evidence of increased spatial exploration of patients' left side achieved during keyboard scale-playing, the current study employed a music intervention that involved making sequential goal-directed actions in the neglected part of space, in order to determine whether this would bring about clinically significant improvement in chronic neglect. Two left neglect patients completed an intervention comprising four weekly 30-min music intervention sessions involving playing scales and familiar melodies on chime bars from right to left. Two cancellation tests [Mesulam shape, Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) star], the neglect subtest from the computerized TAP (Test of Attentional Performance) battery, and the line bisection test were administered three times during a preliminary baseline phase, before and after the four intervention sessions during the intervention phase to investigate short-term effects, and 1 week after the last intervention session to investigate whether any changes in performance would persist. Both patients demonstrated significant short-term and longer-lasting improvements on the Mesulam shape cancellation test. One patient also showed longer-lasting effects on the BIT star cancellation test and scored in the normal range 1 week after the intervention. These findings provide preliminary evidence that active music-making with a horizontally aligned instrument may help neglect patients attend more to their affected side.

Among these cues that impact our behavior and communication with other people is the perceived emotional state of the speaker. A theoretical framework for the neural processing stages of emotional prosody has suggested that auditory emotion is perceived in multiple steps (Schirmer and Kotz, 2006) involving low-level auditory analysis and integration of the acoustic information followed by higher-level cognition. Empirical evidence for this multistep processing chain, however, is still sparse. We examined this question using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a continuous carry-over design (Aguirre, 2007) to measure brain activity while volunteers listened to non-speech-affective vocalizations morphed on a continuum between anger and fear. Analyses dissociated neuronal adaptation effects induced by similarity in perceived emotional content between consecutive stimuli from those induced by their acoustic similarity. We found that bilateral voice-sensitive auditory regions as well as right amygdala coded the physical difference between consecutive stimuli. In contrast, activity in bilateral anterior insulae, medial superior frontal cortex, precuneus, and subcortical regions such as bilateral hippocampi depended predominantly on the perceptual difference between morphs. Our results suggest that the processing of vocal affect recognition is a multistep process involving largely distinct neural networks. Amygdala and auditory areas predominantly code emotion-related acoustic information while more anterior insular and prefrontal regions respond to the abstract, cognitive representation of vocal affect.

To address this, we designed an approach for quantitative analyses of the distribution of GABA(A)R-subunits, GlyR alpha 1-subunit and their anchoring protein, gephyrin, on terminals of rat spinal sensory afferents identified by Calcitonin-Gene-Related-Peptide (CGRP) for peptidergic terminals, and by Isolectin-B4 (IB4) for nonpeptidergic terminals. The approach was designed for light microscopy, which is compatible with the mild fixation conditions necessary for immunodetection of several of these antigens. An algorithm was designed to recognize structures with dimensions similar to those of the microscope resolution. To avoid detecting false colocalization, the latter was considered significant only if the degree of pixel overlap exceeded that expected from randomly overlapping pixels given a hypergeometric distribution. We found that both CGRP(+) and IB4(+) terminals were devoid of GlyR alpha 1-subunit and gephyrin. The alpha 1 GABA(A)R was also absent from these terminals. In contrast, the GABA(A)R alpha 2/alpha 3/alpha 5 and beta 3 subunits were significantly expressed in both terminal types, as were other GABA(A)R-associated-proteins (alpha-Dystroglycan/Neuroligin-2/Collybistin-2). Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of GABA(A)R beta 3 subunits in small afferent terminals. Real-time quantitativePCR(qRT-PCR) confirmed the results of light microscopy immuno-chemical analysis. These results indicate that dorsal horn inhibitory synapses follow different rules of organization at presynaptic versus postsynapticsites(nociceptive afferentterminals vs inhibitory synapses on dorsalhorn neurons). The absence of gephyrin clusters from primary afferent terminals suggests a more diffuse mode of GABA(A)-mediated transmission at presynaptic than at postsynaptic sites.

Statistics of the Vestibular Input Experienced during Natural Self-Motion: Implications for Neural Processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						natural stimuli; power law; preneuronal processing	PERIPHERAL INNERVATION PATTERNS; SOFT-TISSUE RESONANCE; SEMICIRCULAR CANALS; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; HEAD STABILIZATION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; DETECTION THRESHOLDS; SPATIAL INFORMATION; RESPONSE PROPERTIES	It is widely believed that sensory systems are optimized for processing stimuli occurring in the natural environment. However, it remains unknown whether this principle applies to the vestibular system, which contributes to essential brain functions ranging from the most automatic reflexes to spatial perception and motor coordination. Here we quantified, for the first time, the statistics of natural vestibular inputs experienced by freely moving human subjects during typical everyday activities. Although previous studies have found that the power spectra of natural signals across sensory modalities decay as a power law (i.e., as 1/f(alpha)), we found that this did not apply to natural vestibular stimuli. Instead, power decreased slowly at lower and more rapidly at higher frequencies for all motion dimensions. We further establish that this unique stimulus structure is the result of active motion as well as passive biomechanical filtering occurring before any neural processing. Notably, the transition frequency (i.e., frequency at which power starts to decrease rapidly) was lower when subjects passively experienced sensory stimulation than when they actively controlled stimulation through their own movement. In contrast to signals measured at the head, the spectral content of externally generated (i.e., passive) environmental motion did follow a power law. Specifically, transformations caused by both motor control and biomechanics shape the statistics of natural vestibular stimuli before neural processing. We suggest that the unique structure of natural vestibular stimuli will have important consequences on the neural coding strategies used by this essential sensory system to represent self-motion in everyday life.

Event-related brain potentials to emotional images and gonadal steroid hormone levels in patients with schizophrenia and paired controls	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						schizophrenia; event related potential; emotions; gonadic hormones and sex differences	NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; AMYGDALA ACTIVATION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; AFFECTIVE PICTURES; NEURAL RESPONSE; VISUAL-CORTEX; ERP ANALYSIS; ATTENTION	Prominent disturbances in the experience, expression, and emotion recognition in patients with schizophrenia have been relatively well documented over the last few years. Furthermore, sex differences in behavior and brain activity, associated with the processing of various emotions, have been reported in the general population and in schizophrenia patients. Others proposed that sex differences should be rather attributed to testosterone, which may play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. Also, it had been suggested that estradiol may play a protective role in schizophrenia. Surprisingly, few studies investigating this pathology have focused on both brain substrates and gonadal steroid hormone levels, in emotional processing. In the present study, we investigated electrocortical responses related to emotional valence and arousal as well as gonadal steroid hormone levels in patients with schizophrenia. Event-Related Potentials (ERP) were recorded during exposition to emotional pictures in 18 patients with schizophrenia and in 24 control participants paired on intelligence, manual dominance and socioeconomic status. Given their previous sensitivity to emotional and attention processes, the P200, N200 and the P300 were selected for analysis. More precisely, emotional valence generally affects early components (N200), which reflect early process of selective attention, whereas emotional arousal and valence both influences the P300 component, which is related to memory context updating, and stimulus categorization. Results showed that, in the control group, the amplitude of the N200 was significantly more lateralized over the right hemisphere, while there was no such lateralization in patients with schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, significantly smaller anterior P300 amplitude was observed to the unpleasant, compared to the pleasant. That anterior P300 reduction was also correlated with negative symptoms. The N200 and P300 amplitudes were positively correlated with the estradiol level in all conditions, revealing that the N200 and the P300 were reduced, when estradiol level was higher. Conversely, only the P300 amplitude showed positive correlation with the testosterone level.

However, the brain region specificity of caspase-independent PCD in AD-associated neurodegeneration is unknown. We therefore used the transgenic CRND8 (TgCRND8) AD mouse model to explore whether the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), a key mediator of caspase-independent PCD, contributes to cell loss in selected brain regions in the course of aging. Results: Increased expression of truncated AIF (tAIF), which is directly responsible for cell death induction, was observed at both 4- and 6-months of age in the cortex. Concomitant with the up-regulation of tAIF was an increase in the nuclear translocation of this protein. Heightened tAIF expression or translocation was not observed in the hippocampus or cerebellum, which were used as AD-vulnerable and relatively AD-spared regions, respectively. The cortical alterations in tAIF levels were accompanied by increased Bax expression and mitochondrial translocation. This effect was preceded by a significant reduction in ATP content and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, detectable at 2 months of age despite negligible amounts of amyloid-beta peptides (A beta). Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that AIF is likely to play a region-specific role in AD-related caspase-independent PCD, which is consistent with aging-associated mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress.

Notwithstanding the highly stochastic nature of hydrological processes, the development of models capable of describing such complex phenomena is a growing area of research. Providing insight into the modeling of complex phenomena through a thorough overview of the literature, current research, and expanding research horizons can enhance the potential for accurate and well designed models. The last couple of decades have seen remarkable progress in the ability to develop accurate hydrologic models. Among various conceptual and black box models developed over this period, hybrid wavelet and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models have been amongst the most promising in simulating hydrologic processes. The present review focuses on defining hybrid modeling, the advantages of such combined models, as well as the history and potential future of their application in hydrology to predict important processes of the hydrologic cycle. Over the years, the use of wavelet-AI models in hydrology has steadily increased and attracted interest given the robustness and accuracy of the approach. This is attributable to the usefulness of wavelet transforms in multi-resolution analysis, de-noising, and edge effect detection over a signal, as well as the strong capability of AI methods in optimization and prediction of processes. Several ideas for future areas of research are also presented in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thiamine deficiency results in release of soluble factors that disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential and downregulate the glutamate transporter splice-variant GLT-1b in cultured astrocytes	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Excitotoxicity; Vitamin B1; Wernicke's encephalopathy; GLT-1; NF-kappa B; Mitochondrial membrane potential	NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; GENE-EXPRESSION; TNF-ALPHA; WERNICKES ENCEPHALOPATHY; NEURONS; GLAST; METABOLISM; THALAMUS; BRAIN; CELLS	Loss of astrocytic glutamate transporters is a major feature of both thiamine deficiency (TD) and Wernicke's encephalopathy. However, the underlying basis of this process is not well understood. In the present study we have investigated the possibility of release of astrocytic soluble factors that might be involved in the regulation of the glutamate transporter GLT-1b in these cells. Treatment of na ve astrocytes with conditioned media from astrocytes exposed to TD conditions resulted in a progressive decrease in glutamate uptake over 24 h. Immunoblotting and flow cytometry measurements indicated this was accompanied by a 20-40% loss of GLT-1b. Astrocytes exposed to either TD or TD conditioned media showed increased disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential compared to control cells, and treatment of astrocytes with TD resulted in an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and elevated levels of phospho-I kappa B fragment, indicative of increased activation of NF-kappa B. Inhibition of TNF-alpha, activity with the use of a neutralizing antibody blociced the increased NF-kappa B activation, while inhibition of NF-kappa B ameliorated the decrease in GLT-1b and reversed the decrease in glutamate uptake occurring with TD treatment. Together, these findings indicate that astrocytes exposed to TD conditions show responses suggesting that soluble factors released by these cells under conditions of TD play a regulatory role in terms of glutamate transport function and mitochondrial integrity.

NOVEL PRESENILIN MUTATIONS WITHIN MOROCCAN PATIENTS WITH EARLY-ONSET ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Moroccan patients; Alzheimer's disease; frameshift mutations; PS1 PS2 genes	FRAMESHIFT MUTATIONS; ATROPHY; GENE; MRI; ASSOCIATION; IMPAIRMENT; DEMENTIA; PROTEIN; CELLS; MICE	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that causes gradual and irreversible loss of higher brain functions and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, as assessed by autopsy and clinical series. Furthermore, it has an annual incidence of approximately 3% in the 65-74-year-old age group. This incidence rate doubles with every increment of 5 years above the age of 65. In Morocco, AD affects almost 30,000 individuals and this number will possibly increase to 75,000 by 2020 (projections of the World Health Organization (WHO)). Genetically, AD is caused by a mutation in one of at least 3 genes: presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Most cases are late onset and apparently sporadic, most likely as a result of a combination of environmental and non-dominant genetic factors. In Morocco, the genes predisposing individuals to AD and predicting disease incidence remain elusive. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the genetic contribution of mutations in PS1 and PS2 genes to familial early-onset AD cases and sporadic late-onset AD cases. Seventeen sporadic late-onset AD cases and eight familial early-onset AD cases were seen at the memory clinic of the University of Casablanca Neurology Department. These patients underwent standard somatic neurological examination, cognitive function assessment, brain imaging and laboratory tests. Direct sequencing of each exon in PS1 and PS2 genes was performed on genomic DNA of AD patients. Further, we identified 1 novel frameshift mutation in the PS1 gene and 2 novel frameshift mutations in the PS2 gene. Our mutational analysis reports a correlation between clinical symptoms and genetic factors in our cases of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (EOAD). These putative mutations cosegregate with affected family members suggesting a direct mutagenic effect. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mutations in DOCK7 in Individuals with Epileptic Encephalopathy and Cortical Blindness	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							MIGRATION; ERBB4; CELLS; RAC	Epileptic encephalopathies are increasingly thought to be of genetic origin, although the exact etiology remains uncertain in many cases. We describe here three girls from two nonconsanguineous families affected by a clinical entity characterized by dysmorphic features, early-onset intractable epilepsy, intellectual disability, and cortical blindness. In individuals from each family, brain imaging also showed specific changes, including an abnormally marked pontobulbar sulcus and abnormal signals (T2 hyperintensities) and atrophy in the occipital lobe. Exome sequencing performed in the first family did not reveal any gene with rare homozygous variants shared by both affected siblings. It did, however, show one gene, DOCK7, with two rare heterozygous variants (c.2510delA [p.Asp837Alafs*48] and c.3709C>T [p.Arg1237*]) found in both affected sisters. Exome sequencing performed in the proband of the second family also showed the presence of two rare heterozygous variants (c.983C>G [p.Ser328*] and c.6232G>T [p.Glu2078*]) in DOCK7. Sanger sequencing confirmed that all three individuals are compound heterozygotes for these truncating mutations in DOCK7. These mutations have not been observed in public SNP databases and are predicted to abolish domains critical for DOCK7 function. DOCK7 codes for a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor that has been implicated in the genesis and polarization of newborn pyramidal neurons and in the morphological differentiation of GABAergic interneurons in the developing cortex. All together, these observations suggest that loss of DOCK7 function causes a syndromic form of epileptic encephalopathy by affecting multiple neuronal processes.

Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's Disease Are Associated with Dysfunction in Stimulus Valuation But Not Action Valuation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						computational modeling; dopamine; impulse control disorders; Parkinson's disease; prediction error; reinforcement learning	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; RHESUS-MONKEYS; D-2 RECEPTORS; REWARD; REINFORCEMENT; ADDICTION; PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR; MEDICATION	A substantial subset of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients suffers from impulse control disorders (ICDs), which are side effects of dopaminergic medication. Dopamine plays a key role in reinforcement learning processes. One class of reinforcement learning models, known as the actor-critic model, suggests that two components are involved in these reinforcement learning processes: a critic, which estimates values of stimuli and calculates prediction errors, and an actor, which estimates values of potential actions. To understand the information processing mechanism underlying impulsive behavior, we investigated stimulus and action value learning from reward and punishment in four groups of participants: on-medication PD patients with ICD, on-medication PD patients without ICD, off-medication PD patients without ICD, and healthy controls. Analysis of responses suggested that participants used an actor-critic learning strategy and computed prediction errors based on stimulus values rather than action values. Quantitative model fits also revealed that an actor-critic model of the basal ganglia with different learning rates for positive and negative prediction errors best matched the choice data. Moreover, whereas ICDs were associated with model parameters related to stimulus valuation (critic), PD was associated with parameters related to action valuation (actor). Specifically, PD patients with ICD exhibited lower learning from negative prediction errors in the critic, resulting in an underestimation of adverse consequences associated with stimuli. These findings offer a specific neurocomputational account of the nature of compulsive behaviors induced by dopaminergic drugs.

Neurobiological, cognitive, and emotional mechanisms in Melodic Intonation Therapy	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Melodic Intonation Therapy; singing; language rehabilitation; aphasia; mechanisms; neuroplasticity; cognitive; mood	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM; NONFLUENT APHASIA; BROCAS APHASIA; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; MUSIC-THERAPY; POSTSTROKE APHASIA; SPEECH PRODUCTION; IMMUNOGLOBULIN-A; STROKE PATIENTS	Singing has been used in language rehabilitation for decades, yet controversy remains over its effectiveness and mechanisms of action. Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) is the most well-known singing-based therapy; however, speculation surrounds when and how it might improve outcomes in aphasia and other language disorders. While positive treatment effects have been variously attributed to different MIT components, including melody, rhythm, hand-tapping, and the choral nature of the singing, there is uncertainty about the components that are truly necessary and beneficial. Moreover, the mechanisms by which the components operate are not well understood. Within the literature to date, proposed mechanisms can be broadly grouped into four categories: (1) neuroplastic reorganization of language function, (2) activation of the mirror neuron system and multimodal integration, (3) utilization of shared or specific features of music and language, and (4) motivation and mood. In this paper, we review available evidence for each mechanism and propose that these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, but rather represent different levels of explanation, reflecting the neurobiological, cognitive, and emotional effects of MIT Thus, instead of competing, each of these mechanisms may contribute to language rehabilitation, with a better understanding of their relative roles and interactions allowing the design of protocols that maximize the effectiveness of singing therapy for aphasia.

However, using aged rodent models, deficits in auditory processing have been associated with significant decreases in inhibitory signaling attributed to a loss of GABAergic interneurons. Not only are these interneurons crucial for pattern detection and other large-scale population dynamics, but they have also been linked to mechanisms mediating plasticity and learning, making them a prime candidate for study and modeling of modifications to cortical communication pathways in neurodegenerative diseases. Using the rat primary auditory cortex (A1) as a model, we probed the known markers of GABAergic interneurons with immunohistological methods, using antibodies against gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), calretinin (CR), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and cholecystokinin (CCK) to document the changes observed in interneuron populations across the rat's lifespan. This analysis provided strong evidence that several but not all GABAergic neurons were affected by the aging process, showing most dramatic changes in expression of parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) expression. With this evidence, we show how understanding these trajectories of cell counts may be factored into a simple model to quantify changes in inhibitory signaling across the course of life, which may be applied as a framework for creating more advanced simulations of interneuronal implication in normal cerebral processing, normal aging, or pathological processes.

It is increasingly being recognized that several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis present elements of vascular compromise. In addition, the most prominent causes of blindness in pediatric and working age populations (retinopathy of prematurity and diabetic retinopathy, respectively) are characterized by vascular degeneration and failure of physiological vascular regrowth. The aim of this technical paper is to provide a detailed protocol to study CNS vascular regeneration in the retina. The method can be employed to elucidate molecular mechanisms that lead to failure of vascular growth after ischemic injury. In addition, potential therapeutic modalities to accelerate and restore healthy vascular plexuses can be explored. Findings obtained using the described approach may provide therapeutic avenues for ischemic retinopathies such as that of diabetes or prematurity and possibly benefit other vascular disorders of the CNS.

Benefitting from an exponential quantization function, effective resolution of the proposed ADC in the digitization of action potentials is almost 2 bits more than its physical number of bits. Hence, it is shown in this paper that the choice of a proper nonlinear quantization function helps reduce the outgoing bit rate carrying the recorded neural data. Another major benefit of digitizing neural signals using the proposed signal-specific ADC is the considerable reduction in the background noise of the neural signal. The 8-b exponential ADC reported in this paper digitizes large action potentials with maximum resolution of 10.5 bits, while quantizing the small background noise is performed with a resolution of as low as 3 bits. Fully-integrated version of the circuit was designed and fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process, occupying 0.036 mm(2) silicon area. Designed based on a two-step successive-approximation register ADC architecture, the proposed ADC employs a piecewise-linear approximation of the target exponential function for quantization. Operating at a sampling frequency of 25 kS/s (typical for intra-cortical neural recording) and with a supply voltage of 1.8 V, the entire chip, including the ADC and reference circuits, dissipates 87.2 mu W. According to the experiments, Noise-Content-Reduction Ratio (NCRR) of the ADC is 41.1 dB.

However, the current practices of visual inspection have been identified with several limitations, such as: they are time-consuming, provide incomplete information, and their reliance on inspectors' experience. To overcome such limitations, this paper presents an approach of automating the prediction of condition rating for bridges based on digital image analysis. The proposed methodology encompasses image acquisition, development of 3D visualization model, image processing, and condition rating model. Under this method, scaling defect in concrete bridge components is considered as a candidate defect and the guidelines in the Ontario Structure Inspection Manual (OSIM) have been adopted for developing and testing the proposed method. The automated algorithms for scaling depth prediction and mapping of condition ratings are based on training of back propagation neural networks. The result of developed models showed better prediction capability of condition rating over the existing methods such as, Naive Bayes Classifiers and Bagged Decision Tree.

Inflammation has been associated with IVD degeneration, however the relationship between inflammatory factors and chronic low back pain remains unclear. Furthermore, increased levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are both associated with inflammation and chronic low back pain, but whether degenerating discs release sufficient concentrations of factors that induce nociceptor plasticity remains unclear. Degenerating IVDs from low back pain patients and healthy, painless IVDs from human organ donors were cultured ex vivo. Inflammatory and nociceptive factors released by IVDs into culture media were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and protein arrays. The ability of factors released to induce neurite growth and nociceptive neuropeptide production was investigated. Degenerating discs release increased levels of tumour necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, NGF and BDNF. Factors released by degenerating IVDs increased neurite growth and calcitonin gene-related peptide expression, both of which were blocked by anti-NGF treatment. Furthermore, protein arrays found increased levels of 20 inflammatory factors, many of which have nociceptive effects. Our results demonstrate that degenerating and painful human IVDs release increased levels of NGF, inflammatory and nociceptive factors ex vivo that induce neuronal plasticity and may actively diffuse to induce neo-innervation and pain in vivo.

Sleep-wake disturbances are among the most persistent sequelae after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and probably arise during the hospital stay following TBI. These disturbances are characterized by difficulties sleeping at night and staying awake during the day. Objective. The aim of the present study was to document rest-activity cycle consolidation in acute moderate/severe TBI using actigraphy and to assess its association with injury severity and outcome. Methods. In all, 16 hospitalized patients (27.1 +/- 11.3 years) with moderate/severe TBI wore actigraphs for 10 days, starting in the intensive care unit (ICU) when continuous sedation was discontinued and patients had reached medical stability. Activity counts were summed for daytime (7: 00-21: 59 hours) and nighttime periods (22: 00-6: 59 hours). The ratio of daytime period activity to total 24-hour activity was used to quantify rest-activity cycle consolidation. An analysis of variance was carried out to characterize the evolution of the daytime activity ratio over the recording period. Results. Rest-activity cycle was consolidated only 46.6% of all days; however, a significant linear trend of improvement was observed over time. Greater TBI severity and longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay were associated with poorer rest-activity cycle consolidation and evolution. Patients with more rapid return to consolidated rest-activity cycle were more likely to have cleared posttraumatic amnesia and have lower disability at hospital discharge. Conclusions. Patients with acute moderate/severe TBI had an altered rest-activity cycle, probably reflecting severe fragmentation of sleep and wake episodes, which globally improved over time. A faster return to rest-activity cycle consolidation may predict enhanced brain recovery.

Biomechanical analysis of iliac screw fixation in spinal deformity instrumentation	CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS			English	Article						Biomechanical modeling; Iliac screw; Neuromuscular scoliosis; Scoliosis; Spine instrumentation; Spinopelvic instrumentation	NEUROMUSCULAR SCOLIOSIS; VERTEBRAL DEROTATION; 3-D RECONSTRUCTION; PULLOUT STRENGTH; THORACIC SPINE; PEDICLE SCREWS; HUMAN LUMBAR; BEHAVIOR; INTRAOBSERVER; INTEROBSERVER	Background: High rates of iliac screw fixation failures have been reported in spinopelvic instrumentations. The objective was to assess the iliac screw loads as functions of instrumentation variables. Methods: Spinopelvic instrumentations of six neuromuscular scoliosis were simulated using patient-specific modeling techniques to evaluate the intra- and postoperative iliac screw loads as functions of instrumentation variables: the combined use of sacral screws, the uses of lateral offset connectors and cross-rod connectors, and the iliac screw insertion point and trajectory. Findings: sacral screws, lateral connectors and the iliac screw insertion point had significant effects on iliac screw axial forces (69-297 N) and toggle moments (0.8-2.9 N m) (p < 0.05). The addition of sacral screws made the iliac screw forces lower for some functional loads but higher for other functional loads, and resulted in an increase of intraoperative screw forces when attaching the rods onto these additional screws. When lateral offset connectors were used, the toggle moments were 16% and 25% higher, respectively for the left and right sides. Inserting iliac through the sacrum resulted in 17% lower toggle moment compared to insertion through the iliac crest Cross-rod connectors had no significant effect on the intraoperative iliac screw forces. Postoperative functional loading had an important effect (additional 34% screw axial force and 18% toggle moment). Interpretation: It is possible to reduce the iliac screw loads by adapting instrumentation variables and strategies. Reducing the loads could decrease the risk of failure associated with iliac screw fixations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VCR cytotoxicity is primarily due to its ability to disrupt the formation of microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Patients & methods: A total of 17 polymorphisms in regulatory and coding regions of genes controlling VCR targets (TUBB1, MAP4, ACTG1 and CAPG) or potentially influencing VCR levels (ABCB1 and CYP3A5) were investigated for an association with peripheral neuropathy and outcome in childhood ALL patients. Results: High-grade neurotoxicity was more frequent in carriers of the A allele of synonymous (Ala310) G to A (rs1135989) variation in the ACTG1 gene. Substitution (rs4728709) in the promoter of the ABCB1 gene had a protective effect against lower grade neurotoxicity and C to A variation (rs3770102) located 17 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site had a protective effect against high-grade neurotoxicity. Patients with the ABCB1 3435TT genotype had lower event-free survival; the association with event-free survival was not supported by the analysis in the replication patient set. Conclusion: The polymorphisms in the ACTG1, CAPG and ABCB1 genes may modulate VCR-related neurotoxicity, whereas the risk of relapse seems not to be affected by the genes of the VCR pathway.

Early vestibular processing does not discriminate active from passive self-motion if there is a discrepancy between predicted and actual proprioceptive feedback	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						sensory coding; self-motion; response selectivity efference copy; voluntary movement; vestibular; proprioception	HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; VESTIBULOSPINAL NEURONS; HEAD MOVEMENTS; EYE-MOVEMENT; BRAIN-STEM; VENTROPOSTERIOR THALAMUS; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; SENSORY PREDICTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; FIRING BEHAVIOR	Most of our sensory experiences are gained by active exploration of the world. While the ability to distinguish sensory inputs resulting of our own actions (termed reafference) from those produced externally (termed exafference) is well established, the neural mechanisms underlying this distinction are not fully understood. We have previously proposed that vestibular signals arising from self-generated movements are inhibited by a mechanism that compares the internal prediction of the proprioceptive consequences of self-motion to the actual feedback. Here we directly tested this proposal by recording from single neurons in monkey during vestibular stimulation that was externally produced and/or self-generated. We show for the first time that vestibular reafference is equivalently canceled for self-generated sensory stimulation produced by activation of the neck musculature (head-on-body motion), or axial musculature (combined head and body motion), when there is no discrepancy between the predicted and actual proprioceptive consequences of self-motion. However, if a discrepancy does exist, central vestibular neurons no longer preferentially encode vestibular exafference. Specifically, when simultaneous active and passive motion resulted in activation of the same muscle proprioceptors, neurons robustly encoded the total vestibular input (i.e., responses to vestibular reafference and exafference were equally strong), rather than exafference alone. Taken together, our results show that the cancellation of vestibular reafference in early vestibular processing requires an explicit match between expected and actual proprioceptive feedback. We propose that this vital neuronal computation, necessary for both accurate sensory perception and motor control, has important implications for a variety of sensory systems that suppress self-generated signals.

Comparison between an automatic and a visual scoring method of the chin muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						REM sleep behavior disorder; Atonia index; REM sleep without atonia; Tonic chin EMG; Phasic chin EMG; Automatic analysis	BEHAVIOR DISORDER; EMG AMPLITUDE; NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; NIGHT VARIABILITY; DREAMS; ATONIA	Objective: To compare two different methods, one visual and the other automatic, for the quantification of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia (RSWA) in the diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Methods: Seventy-four RBD patients (mean age, 62.14 +/- 9.67 years) and 75 normal controls (mean age, 61.04 +/- 12.13 years) underwent one night video-polysomnographic recording. The chin electromyogram (EMG) during REM sleep was analyzed by means of a previously published visual method quantifying the percentage of 30 s epochs scored as tonic (abnormal, >= 30%) and that of 2 s mini-epochs containing phasic EMG events (abnormal, >= 15%). For the computer quantitative analysis we used the automatic scoring,algorithm known as the atonia index (abnormal, <0.8). The percentage correct classification, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen kappa were calculated. Results: The atonia index correctly classified 82.6% of subjects, similar to the percentage of correct classifications with individual components of the visual analysis (83.2% each for tonic and phasic), and the combined visual parameters (85.9%). The sensitivity and specificity of automatic analysis (84% and 81%) was similar to the combined visual analysis (89% and 83%). The correlation coefficient between the automatic atonia index and the percentage of visual tonic EMG was high (r = -0.886, P < 0.00001), with moderately high correlation with the percentage of phasic EMG (r = -0.690, P < 0.00001). The agreement between atonia index and the visual parameters (individual or combined) was approximately 85% with Cohen's kappa, ranging from 0.638 to 0.693. Conclusion: Sensitivity, specificity, and correct classifications were high with both methods. Moreover, there was general agreement between methods, with Cohen's kappa values in the 'good' range. Given the considerable practical advantages of automatic quantification of REM atonia, automatic quantification may be a useful alternative to visual scoring methods in otherwise uncomplicated polysomnograms.

This study aimed to assess prospectively and comparatively the recall of dreaming and of disturbed dreaming in late pregnancy. Methods: Fifty-seven nulliparous, third-trimester pregnant women (mean age +/- SD, 28.7 +/- 4.06 years) and 59 non-pregnant controls (mean age +/- SD, 26.8 +/- 4.21 years) completed demographics and psychological questionnaires. A 14-day prospective home log assessed sleep and dream characteristics and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire measured retrospective dream and disturbed dream recall. Results: Even though pregnant and non-pregnant women showed similar prospective dream recall (P = 0.47), pregnant women reported prospectively more bad dreams (P = 0.004). More pregnant women (21%) than non-pregnant women (7%) reported a nightmare incidence exceeding moderately severe pathology (>1/week) (P = 0.03). Pregnant women also reported overall lower sleep quality (P = 0.007) and more night awakenings (P = 0.003). Higher prospective recall of bad dreams (r = -0.40, P = 0.002) and nightmares (r = -0.32, P = 0.001) both correlated with lower sleep quality in pregnant women. Conclusions: Late pregnancy is a period of markedly increased dysphoric dream imagery that may be a major contributor to impaired sleep at this time. Further polysomnographic assessments of pregnant women are needed to clarify relationships between sleep and disturbed dream production in this population. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These events seem to stimulate similar neural pathways that increase (1) social recognition, (2) motivation, reward; and (3) decrease fear/anxiety. Subregions of the amygdala and cortex facilitate social recognition and also disinhibition to decrease rejection responses. The interrelationship between MeA, BNST, LS may mediate the activation of NAcc via the mPOA to increase motivation and reward. Cortical areas such as the ACC discriminate between stimuli. The interaction between OT and D2-type receptors in NAcc shell facilitates intraspecific attachment, but D1-type appears to facilitate parental attachment. This difference may be important for maternal females to direct their attention, motivation and expression of attachment toward the appropriate target. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The process of meaning-making in adjustment to multiple sclerosis	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			French	Article						Psychological adaptation; Multiple sclerosis; Qualitative research	SENSE; MODEL; RECONSTRUCTION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ASSOCIATIONS; DISABILITY; COGNITION; ILLNESS; EVENTS; GRIEF	Introduction. - Progressive neurological disorders require continual adaptation. People who maintain a better psychological balance in the face of the disease are those who find meaning in their experience. The ability to find a positive meaning in having multiple sclerosis (MS) is more common in people who are at the beginning of their disease or those who have few functional limitations (Pakenham, 2008). This qualitative study examines the process of meaning-making by people who are moderately to severely affected by MS. Methods. - Eight participants told the story of their experiences in individual semi-structured interviews. The verbatim transcripts were subjected to phenomenological analysis. Results. - The results allowed the identification of the essential elements that shape the experience of meaning-making. The adaptation happens in two main areas: (1) limiting the impact of specific symptoms, and (2) investing in activities that combine meaningful relationships and the feeling of being useful. Meaning is developed in the search for a new existential balance that reconciles creative tensions, particularly in the oscillation between letting go and determination. The process of meaning-making is distributed along a continuum of strategies that allows one to act as if nothing had happened, act within the limits of the disease, act despite the disease, act in new ways because of the disease, or act thanks to the disease. Conclusions. - Understanding the process of meaning-making while adjusting to MS can allow the identification of possible interventions to better accompany people who are most severely affected by MS in their adaptation to the disease.

Evidence regarding relative contributions of predictors of functional outcome, including symptoms and cognition, remains equivocal. The objective of the study was to determine the relative contribution of cognition, in particular verbal memory, and symptomatic remission to social and occupational functioning while controlling for established predictors of functioning in a large sample of patients presenting with a first episode of a schizophrenia spectrum or affective psychosis. Method: Patients (aged 14-35 years) met DSM-IV criteria for a first episode of a schizophrenia spectrum or affective psychosis and had been admitted to the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychoses, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, between 2003 and 2009 for treatment and follow-up for 2 years. Established predictors (duration of untreated psychosis, medication adherence, age at onset, substance use, premorbid adjustment), verbal memory, and length of positive and negative symptom remission were regressed on functioning (using the Strauss Carpenter Scale) at 1 (n = 208) and 2 (n = 159) years. Regressions were conducted with established predictors in the first step, followed by verbal memory and consecutive months of combined positive and negative symptom remission in the third step. Regressions were then repeated with length of positive and negative symptom remission, respectively. Results: Length of combined positive and negative symptom remission explained the most variance in functioning at 1 (R-2 adjusted = 0.35, F-9,F-129 = 9.33, P <.001) and 2 (R-2 adjusted = 0.38, F-9,F-97 = 8.21, P < .001) years, and verbal memory contributed only slightly to such outcome. While length of remission of negative symptoms was a stronger predictor of functioning than remission of positive symptoms at 1 year, length of positive symptom remission also made a large contribution at 2 years. Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of achieving and maintaining remission of both negative and positive symptoms for longer periods in patients with a first episode of a psychotic disorder and the need for effective interventions to do so.

Methods: Prospective, 24-week double-blind study with an open-label extension. Subjects were randomized to onabotulinumtoxinA + standard of care or placebo + standard of care, at baseline and at 12 weeks, if judged appropriate, with follow-up to 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the number of patients achieving their principal active functional goal at 24 weeks (or 10 weeks after an optional second injection). Secondary endpoints included achievement of a different active or a passive goal at this timepoint. Results: The intent-to-treat population comprised 273 patients. The proportion of patients achieving their principal active functional goal and secondary active functional goal with onabotulinumtoxinA + standard of care was not statistically different from placebo + standard of care. Significantly more patients achieved their secondary passive goal with onabotulinumtoxinA + standard of care (60.0%) vs. placebo + standard of care (38.6%) (odds ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-5.14) as well as higher Goal Attainment Scaling levels for upper limb and ankle flexor subgroups. Conclusions: Addition of onabotulinumtoxinA to standard of care as part of goal-oriented rehabilitation in post-stroke spasticity patients significantly increased passive goal achievement and was associated with higher levels of active function.

We focus on the potential impact of DDI use, as this drug has not been as studied intensively as ABC. We propose a flexible marginal structural Cox model with weighted cumulative exposure modeling (Cox WCE MSM) to address two key challenges encountered when using observational longitudinal data to assess the adverse effects of medication: (1) the need to model the cumulative effect of a time-dependent treatment and (2) the need to control for time-dependent confounders that also act as mediators of the effect of past treatment. Simulations confirm that the Cox WCE MSM yields accurate estimates of the causal treatment effect given complex exposure effects and time-dependent confounding. We then use the new flexible Cox WCE MSM to assess the association between DDI use and CVD risk in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. In contrast to the nonsignificant results obtained with conventional parametric Cox MSMs, our new Cox WCE MSM identifies a significant short-term risk increase due to DDI use in the previous year.

Image-Based Spatially Variant and Count Rate Dependent Point Spread Function on the HRRT	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Depth of interaction; HRRT; PET; PSF	RESOLUTION RESEARCH TOMOGRAPH; ECAT HRRT; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; SYSTEM MATRIX; PET SCANNER; RECONSTRUCTION; SINOGRAMS; ALGORITHM; IMPACT; PILEUP	Spatial resolution on the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) is of high importance, due to the need for accurate quantification of small brain structures. Thus accurate characterization of the scanner's resolution properties and subsequent inclusion of such information within image reconstruction, requires measuring its point spread function (PSF). In this study we measured in detail the spatial variation of the image space PSF and assessed the impact of the scanner's depth of interaction (DOI) capability on the spatial resolution. Furthermore, we characterized the dependency of the PSF on progressively increasing count rate statistics. An array of 15 x 11 printed point sources was scanned twice, initially on its own to measure the PSF spatial dependency, and subsequently with an extension line containing similar to 300 MBq of carbon-11, to assess the count rate dependency. PSF data were reconstructed with the scanner's default OP-OSEM and invariant PSF OP-OSEM algorithms, followed by image space model fitting. The axial, radial and tangential components of the PSF were found to vary under radial and angular transformations, but being radially symmetric and almost axially independent. The FWHM improves by similar to 1.3 mm using the PSF-OP-OSEM but is still radially variable with similar to 1 mm degradation within the FOV boundaries. When DOI was not taken into account, an additional degradation up to 0.7 mm was seen in the radial FWHM using OP-OSEM. Using the invariant PSF OP-OSEM, this degradation was less notable (similar to 0.5 mm), despite the fact an invariant kernel is used. In terms of count rate dependency, a clear resolution degradation was seen for mean count rates above 5-10 kcps. However, this degradation was found to vary within the FOV. The spatially variant PSF at low count rates could be incorporated within a resolution modelling image reconstruction. However, including a count rate dependent PSF model is less straightforward.

For many individuals this starts with the early expression of impulsive risk-taking, social gregariousness, and oppositional behaviors. Here we propose that these early diverse manifestations reflect a heightened ability of emotionally salient stimuli to activate dopamine pathways that foster behavioral approach. If substance use is initiated, these at-risk youth can also develop heightened responses to drug-paired cues. Through conditioning and drug-induced sensitization, these effects strengthen and accumulate, leading to responses that exceed those elicited by other rewards. At the same time, cues not paired with drug become associated with comparatively lower dopamine release, accentuating further the difference between drug and non-drug rewards. Together, these enhancing and inhibiting processes steer a pre-existing vulnerability toward a disproportionate concern for drugs and drug-related stimuli. Implications for prevention and treatment are discussed.

TRIBE-AKI Consortium	Serum Brain Natriuretic Peptide and Risk of Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Operations in Children	ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY			English	Article							ACUTE-RENAL-FAILURE; CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS-SURGERY; CONGENITAL HEART-DISEASE; PATENT DUCTUS-ARTERIOSUS; NONCARDIAC SURGERY; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; OUTCOMES; INFANTS; UTILITY; METAANALYSIS	Background. Acute kidney injury (AKI) after pediatric cardiac operations is associated with poor outcomes and is difficult to predict. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate whether preoperative brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels predict postoperative AKI among children undergoing cardiac operations. Methods. This was a three-center, prospective study (2007-2009) of 277 children undergoing cardiac operations (n = 121, aged < 2 years) with available preoperative BNP values. Preoperative BNP was measured and categorized into tertiles. The performance of BNP was evaluated alone and in combination with clinical factors. AKI was defined as doubling of serum creatinine or need for acute dialysis. Results. Postoperative AKI occurred in 165 children (60%), with 118 cases (43%) being mild and 47 cases (17%) severe. Preoperative BNP was not associated with increased risk of mild or severe postoperative AKI and did not significantly improve AKI risk prediction when added to clinical models. Preoperative BNP was, however, associated with several clinical outcomes, including length of stay and mechanical ventilation. The results were similar when the analysis was repeated in the subset of children younger than 2 years of age or when the association of postoperative BNP and AKI was evaluated. Conclusions. Preoperative BNP levels did not predict postoperative AKI in this cohort of children undergoing cardiac operations. Both preoperative and postoperative BNP levels are associated with postoperative outcomes. Clinical Trial Registration at Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00774137.

Both of these maleimide-AuNPs, when reacted with the silicon fluorine prosthetic group [F-18]SiFA-SH, resulted in radiolabeled AuNPs. These NPs were readily purified with high radiochemical yields (RCY) of 60-80% via size exclusion chromatography. Preliminary small animal positron emission tomography (PET) measurements in healthy rats gives information about the pathway of excretion and the stability of the radioactive label in vivo. The partially hydrolyzed [F-18]SiFA-maleimide-AuNPs shows uptake in the brain region of interest (ROI) (> 0.13%ID/g) which was confirmed by ex vivo examination of the thoroughly perfused rat brain. The multiple maleimide end groups on the AuNP surface also allows for the simultaneous incorporation of [F-18]SiFA-SH and a bioactive peptide (cysteine-modified octreotate, cys-TATE, which can bind to somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 and 5) in a proof-of-concept study. The well-defined Michael addition reaction between various thiol containing molecules and the multifunctionalized maleimide-AuNPs thus offers an opportunity to develop a new bioconjugation platform for new diagnostics as well as therapeutics.

Data sourceCochrane library, Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the MRCT databases were used to screen studies from January 1990 to December 2012. Study selectionAccording to Cochrane criteria, we selected randomized controlled trials that compared nonpharmacologic approaches for pain relief during labor to usual care, using intention-to-treat method. ResultsNonpharmacologic approaches, based on Gate Control (water immersion, massage, ambulation, positions) and Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (acupressure, acupuncture, electrical stimulation, water injections), are associated with a reduction in epidural analgesia and a higher maternal satisfaction with childbirth. When compared with nonpharmacologic approaches based on Central Nervous System Control (education, attention deviation, support), usual care is associated with increased odds of epidural OR 1.13 (95% CI 1.05-1.23), cesarean delivery OR 1.60 (95% CI 1.18-2.18), instrumental delivery OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.03-1.44), use of oxytocin OR 1.20 (95% CI 1.01-1.43), labor duration (29.7min, 95% CI 4.5-54.8), and a lesser satisfaction with childbirth. Tailored nonpharmacologic approaches, based on continuous support, were the most effective for reducing obstetric interventions. ConclusionNonpharmacologic approaches to relieve pain during labor, when used as a part of hospital pain relief strategies, provide significant benefits to women and their infants without causing additional harm.

Incorrect Reconstitution of IncobotulinumtoxinA Leads to Loss of Neurotoxin	JOURNAL OF DRUGS IN DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							TOXIN TYPE-A; COMPLEXING PROTEINS; DOUBLE-BLIND; POTENCY; ONABOTULINUMTOXINA; BLEPHAROSPASM; XEOMIN(R); EFFICACY; LINES; FACE	Background: IncobotulinumtoxinA (INCO) was approved for aesthetic use in the United States in 2011. When reconstituted per manufacturer's instructions, diminished delivery of INCO in US may result. Objective: Investigators sought to determine whether potential loss of decreased motor activity could be demonstrated, using a simple reconstitution technique. Methods and Materials: In this 5-patient study, investigators added 2.0 mL of saline to INCO powder at the bottom of the first of 5 vials, swirling gently to dissolve INCO powder at the bottom. Reconstituted INCO was discarded and the cap was replaced. The "empty" vial then received 0.6 mL of saline, and was swirled and inverted 3 times to ensure dissolution. The 0.6 mL from the first vial was added to the second "empty" vial and the process was repeated for the remaining 3 vials (5 vials per patient). Patients were injected from reconstitution of "empty" vials to determine neuromodulatory activity. Pre- and post-treatment patient photographs of maximal contraction were taken. Results: Markedly diminished maximal frown could be observed in all 5 patients. Conclusion: Improper reconstitution of INCO, or swirling without inversion of the vial following saline injection, can result in significant loss of units of the neurotoxin in the clinical setting.

Several studies have documented autonomic dysfunction in iRBD, but large-scale assessment of autonomic symptoms has never been systematically performed. Patients with polysomnography-confirmed iRBD (318 cases) and controls (137 healthy volunteers and 181 sleep center controls with sleep diagnoses other than RBD) were recruited from 13 neurological centers in 10 countries from 2008 to 2011. A validated scale to study the disorders of the autonomic nervous system in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, the SCOPA-AUT, was administered to all the patients and controls. The SCOPA-AUT consists of 25 items assessing the following domains: gastrointestinal, urinary, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, pupillomotor, and sexual dysfunction. Our results show that compared to control subjects with a similar overall age and sex distribution, patients with iRBD experience significantly more problems with gastrointestinal, urinary, and cardiovascular functioning. The most prominent differences in severity of autonomic symptoms between our iRBD patients and controls emerged in the gastrointestinal domain. Interestingly, it has been reported that an altered gastrointestinal motility can predate the motor phase of PD. The cardiovascular domain SCOPA-AUT score in our study in iRBD patients was intermediate with respect to the scores reported in PD patients by other authors. Our findings underline the importance of collecting data on autonomic symptoms in iRBD. These data may be used in prospective studies for evaluating the risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders.

Methods The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL were searched from January 1, 1980 to August 12, 2013 for interventional randomized controlled treatment trials (RCTs) of idiopathic OAB. Phenotying for pathophysiologies originating in the urothelial/mucosal layer of the bladder, the detrusor muscle cell layer, and the central nervous system were sought. Articles that analyzed urgency outcomes based on pathophysiologic profiling were selected. Due to the heterogeneity of the included interventions and outcome assessment measures, meta-analysis was not appropriate and a qualitative synthesis was undertaken. Results Of 239 original RCTs of idiopathic OAB, 48 (20%) profiled participants on underlying pathophysiology. Less than half of these (n=20) reported treatment efficacy for urgency symptoms by pathophysiological sub-type. One examined the effect of botulinum A toxin on interstitial cell protein expression. Four compared treatment efficacy in OAB patients with and without involuntary detrusor contractions. Fifteen compared the effect of treatment on urgency reduction in patients with detrusor overactivity. There were no consistent trends in treatment efficacy according to pathophysiologic sub-type. No studies examined urothelial dysfunction or abnormal central processing of bladder afferent signaling in response to treatment. Conclusions In order to advance the field of idiopathic OAB, more trials are needed that profile and test urgency outcomes in participants according to suspected underlying pathophysiology.

In addition, it possesses sequence motifs for forming multiple complexes with three different histone acetyltransferases, MOZ, MORF, and HBO1. Within these complexes, BRPF1 serves as a scaffold for bridging subunit interaction, stimulating acetyltransferase activity, governing substrate specificity and stimulating gene expression. To investigate how these molecular interactions are extrapolated to biological functions of BRPF1, we utilized a mouse strain containing a knock-in reporter and analyzed the spatiotemporal expression from embryos to adults. The analysis revealed dynamic expression in the extraembryonic, embryonic, and fetal tissues, suggesting important roles of Brpf1 in prenatal development. In support of this, inactivation of the mouse Brpf1 gene causes lethality around embryonic day 9.5. After birth, high expression is present in the testis and specific regions of the brain. The 4-dimensional expression atlas of mouse Brpf1 should serve as a valuable guide for analyzing its interaction with Moz, Morf, and Hbo1 in vivo, as well as for investigating whether Brpf1 functions independently of these three enzymatic epigenetic regulators.

We summarize the presentations from a conference in which invited participants reviewed relevant aspects of the physiology, mechanisms of action, pharmacology, and data from studies with animal models and human subjects. Cannabis has been used to treat disease since ancient times. 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC) is the major psychoactive ingredient and CBD is the major nonpsychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Cannabis and 9-THC are anticonvulsant in most animal models but can be proconvulsant in some healthy animals. The psychotropic effects of 9-THC limit tolerability. CBD is anticonvulsant in many acute animal models, but there are limited data in chronic models. The antiepileptic mechanisms of CBD are not known, but may include effects on the equilibrative nucleoside transporter; the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55; the transient receptor potential of vanilloid type-1 channel; the 5-HT1a receptor; and the 3 and 1 glycine receptors. CBD has neuroprotective and antiinflammatory effects, and it appears to be well tolerated in humans, but small and methodologically limited studies of CBD in human epilepsy have been inconclusive. More recent anecdotal reports of high-ratio CBD:9-THC medical marijuana have claimed efficacy, but studies were not controlled. CBD bears investigation in epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction, and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. However, we lack data from well-powered double-blind randomized, controlled studies on the efficacy of pure CBD for any disorder. Initial dose-tolerability and double-blind randomized, controlled studies focusing on target intractable epilepsy populations such as patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes are being planned. Trials in other treatment-resistant epilepsies may also be warranted.

Methods PuLsE (Open Prospective Randomized Long-term Effectiveness) was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, and long-term effectiveness study (conducted at 28sites in Europe and Canada). Adults with pharmacoresistant focal seizures (n=112) received VNS+BMP or BMP (1:1 ratio). Medications and VNS parameters could be adjusted as clinically indicated for optimal seizure control while minimizing adverse effects. Primary endpoint was mean change from baseline HRQoL (using Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-89 total score; QOLIE-89). Secondary endpoints included changes in seizure frequency, responder rate (50% decrease in seizure frequency), Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D), Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory-Epilepsy scale (NDDI-E), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I), Adverse Event Profile(AEP), and antiepileptic drug(AED) load. The study was prematurely terminated due to recruitment difficulties prior to completing the planned enrollment of n=362. Results for n=96 who had baseline and at least one follow-up QOLIE-89 assessment (from months3-12) were included in this analysis. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of variance was performed on change from baseline for the primary and secondary endpoints. Results Significant between-group differences in favor of VNS+BMP were observed regarding improvement in HRQoL, seizure frequency, and CGI-I score (respective p-values<0.05, 0.03, and 0.01). More patients in the VNS+BMP group (43%) reported adverse events(AEs) versus BMP group (21%) (p=0.01), a difference reflecting primarily mostly transient AEs related to VNS implantation or stimulation. No significant difference between treatment groups was observed for changes in CES-D, NDDI-E, AEP, and AED load. Significance VNS therapy as a treatment adjunct to BMP in patients with pharmacoresistant focal seizures was associated with a significant improvement in HRQoL compared with BMP alone.

Advancing research diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease: the IWG-2 criteria	LANCET NEUROLOGY			English	Review							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID BIOMARKERS; VARIANT FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TEMPORAL-LOBE DYSFUNCTION; BRAIN GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; BETA-AMYLOID 1-42; PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE APHASIA; POSTERIOR CORTICAL ATROPHY; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION	In the past 8 years, both the International Working Group (IWG) and the US National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Association have contributed criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that better define clinical phenotypes and integrate biomarkers into the diagnostic process, covering the full staging of the disease. This Position Paper considers the strengths and limitations of the IWG research diagnostic criteria and proposes advances to improve the diagnostic framework. On the basis of these refinements, the diagnosis of AD can be simplified, requiring the presence of an appropriate clinical AD phenotype (typical or atypical) and a pathophysiological biomarker consistent with the presence of Alzheimer's pathology. We propose that downstream topographical biomarkers of the disease, such as volumetric MRI and fiuorodeoxyglucose PET, might better serve in the measurement and monitoring of the course of disease. This paper also elaborates on the specific diagnostic criteria for atypical forms of AD, for mixed AD, and for the predinical states of AD.

Previous investigations into the experience of closure have typically relied upon the use of abstract harmonic formula as stimuli. However, these formula often misrepresent the ways in which composers articulate phrase endings in tonal music. This study, on the contrary, examines a wide variety of cadential types typically found in the classical style, including evaded cadences, which have yet to be examined in an experimental setting. The present findings reveal that cadential categories play a pivotal role in the perception of closure, and for musicians especially, ratings of the cadential categories provide empirical support for a model of cadential strength proposed in music theory. A number of rhetorical features also affect participants' ratings of closure, such as formal context, the presence of a melodic dissonance at the cadential arrival, and the use of a trill within the penultimate dominant. Finally, the results indicate that expertise modulates attention, with musicians privileging bass-line motion and nonmusicians attending primarily to the soprano voice.

Although aetiology-specific differences in presentation are evident, the clinical signs and symptoms of these neuropathies are clearly similar. Data from animal models of neuropathic pain suggest that the similarities have a common cause: mitochondrial dysfunction in primary afferent sensory neurons. Mitochondrial dysfunction is caused by mitotoxic effects of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs of several chemical classes, HIV-associated viral proteins, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor treatment, as well as the (possibly both direct and indirect) effects of excess glucose. The mitochondrial injury results in a chronic neuronal energy deficit, which gives rise to spontaneous nerve impulses and a compartmental neuronal degeneration that is first apparent in the terminal receptor arbor-that is, intraepidermal nerve fibres-of cutaneous afferent neurons. Preliminary data suggest that drugs that prevent mitochondrial injury or improve mitochondrial function could be useful in the treatment of these conditions.

Bahi-Buisson et al. review neuroimaging and neuropathological data in patients and distinguish five cortical malformation patterns: microlissencephaly, lissencephaly, central pachygyria and polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia, generalized polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia, and a 'simplified' gyral pattern.Complex cortical malformations associated with mutations in tubulin genes: TUBA1A, TUBA8, TUBB2B, TUBB3, TUBB5 and TUBG1 commonly referred to as tubulinopathies, are a heterogeneous group of conditions with a wide spectrum of clinical severity. Among the 106 patients selected as having complex cortical malformations, 45 were found to carry mutations in TUBA1A (42.5%), 18 in TUBB2B (16.9%), 11 in TUBB3 (10.4%), three in TUBB5 (2.8%), and three in TUBG1 (2.8%). No mutations were identified in TUBA8. Systematic review of patients' neuroimaging and neuropathological data allowed us to distinguish at least five cortical malformation syndromes: (i) microlissencephaly (n = 12); (ii) lissencephaly (n = 19); (iii) central pachygyria and polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia (n = 24); (iv) generalized polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia (n = 6); and (v) a 'simplified' gyral pattern with area of focal polymicrogyria (n = 19). Dysmorphic basal ganglia are the hallmark of tubulinopathies (found in 75% of cases) and are present in 100% of central pachygyria and polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia and simplified gyral malformation syndromes. Tubulinopathies are also characterized by a high prevalence of corpus callosum agenesis (32/80; 40%), and mild to severe cerebellar hypoplasia and dysplasia (63/80; 78.7%). Foetal cases (n = 25) represent the severe end of the spectrum and show specific abnormalities that provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology. The overall complexity of tubulinopathies reflects the pleiotropic effects of tubulins and their specific spatio-temporal profiles of expression. In line with previous reports, this large cohort further clarifies overlapping phenotypes between tubulinopathies and although current structural data do not allow prediction of mutation-related phenotypes, within each mutated gene there is an associated predominant pattern of cortical dysgenesis allowing some phenotype-genotype correlation. The core phenotype of TUBA1A and TUBG1 tubulinopathies are lissencephalies and microlissencephalies, whereas TUBB2B tubulinopathies show in the majority, centrally predominant polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia. By contrast, TUBB3 and TUBB5 mutations cause milder malformations with focal or multifocal polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia with abnormal and simplified gyral pattern.

This increase further leads to a rise in indoor environment temperature, reduction of thermal comfort, increase of cooling demand, and heat related morbidity and mortality especially among vulnerable people such as the elderlies and those living in poorly ventilated buildings. Thus, it is imperative for cities to be empowered with predictive tools during extreme heat waves in order to be able to provide emergency plans. For this purpose, it is utmost importance to develop specialized tools to predict the indoor conditions based on the outdoor conditions recorded at the weather stations. In order to develop a reliable warning system artificial neural network (ANN) and regression method were proposed and tested for an indoor air temperature forecasting application with respect to neighborhood parameters. To find the most practical approach, a cross comparison of the models was conducted by two different levels of simulation in order to present the capturing and prediction performance of the developed models. In general, the ANN model showed better accuracy in predicting the indoor dry-bulb temperature while it was more complicated in implementation. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: We performed germline NF1, SPRED1, and GNAS1 (exon 8) mutation testing on patients with Jaffe-Cainpanacci syndrome of Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome-related features, We also performed somatic NF1 mutation testing on nonossifying fibromas and giant, cell lesions. Results: Pathogenic germline NF1 mutations Were identified 13 of 14 patients with multiple cafe-au-lait macules and niultiple non-ossifying fibromas or giant cell lesions ("classicar Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome); all 13 also fulfilled the National Institues of Health diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 1. Somatic NFI mutations were detected in two giant cell lesions but not in two nonossifying fibromas. No SPRED1 or GNAS1 (exon 8) mutations were detected in the seven NF1-negative patients with Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome, nonossifying fibromas, or giant cell lesions. Conclusion: In this study, the majority of patients with cafe-au-lait macules and nonossifying fibromas Or giant cell lesions harbored a pathogenic gerinline NF1 mutation,suggesting that many Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome cases may-actually have neurofibromatosis type 1. We provide the first proof of specific somatic second-hit mutations affecting NFI in two giant cell lesions from two unrelated patients, establishing these as neurofibromatosis type 1-associated tumors.

Distribution of oxygenated blood throughout the neuroaxis takes place at the level of the circle of Willis (CW). While morphologic and functional alterations in CW arteries and its main branches have been reported in cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, accompanying changes in protein expression profiles remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we performed proteomics to compile a novel list of proteins present in mouse CW arteries and its ramifications. Circle of Willis arteries were surgically removed from 6-month-old wild-type mice, proteins extracted and analyzed by two proteomics approaches, gel-free nanoLC-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS and gel-based GeILC-MS/MS, using nanoAcquity UPLC coupled with ESI-LTQ Orbitrap XL. The two approaches helped maximize arterial proteome coverage. Six biologic and two technical replicates were performed. In all, 2,188 proteins with at least 2 unique high-scoring peptides were identified (6,630 proteins total). Proteins were classified according to vasoactivity, blood-brain barrier specificity, tight junction and adhesion molecules, membrane transporters/channels, and extracellular matrix/basal lamina proteins. Furthermore, we compared the identified CW arterial proteome with the published brain microvascular proteome. Our database provides a vital resource for the study of CW cerebral arterial protein expression profiles in health and disease.

An NIH State-of-the-Science Conference was convened in 2012 to address new findings, particularly the use of the medication sapropterin to treat some individuals with PKU, and to develop a research agenda. Prior to the 2012 conference, five working groups of experts and public members met over a 1-year period. The working groups addressed the following: long-term outcomes and management across the lifespan; PKU and pregnancy; diet control and management; pharmacologic interventions; and molecular testing, new technologies, and epidemiologic considerations. In a parallel and independent activity, an Evidence-based Practice Center supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted a systematic review of adjuvant treatments for PKU; its conclusions were presented at the conference. The conference included the findings of the working groups, panel discussions from industry and international perspectives, and presentations on topics such as emerging treatments for PKU, transitioning to adult care, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulatory perspective. Over 85 experts participated in the conference through information gathering and/or as presenters during the conference, and they reached several important conclusions. The most serious neurological impairments in PKU are preventable with current dietary treatment approaches. However, a variety of more subtle physical, cognitive, and behavioral consequences of even well-controlled PKU are now recognized. The best outcomes in maternal PKU occur when blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations are maintained between 120 and 360 Rtnol/L before and during pregnancy. The dietary management treatment goal for individuals with PKU is a blood Phe concentration between 120 and 360 [tmol/L. The use of genotype information in the newborn period may yield valuable insights about the severity of the condition for infants diagnosed before maximal Phe levels are achieved. While emerging and established genotype-phenotype correlations may transform our understanding of PKU, establishing correlations with intellectual outcomes is more challenging. Regarding the use of sapropterin in PKU, there are significant gaps in predicting response to treatment; at least half of those with PKU will have either minimal or no response. A coordinated approach to PKU treatment improves long-term outcomes for those with PKU and facilitates the conduct of research to improve diagnosis and treatment. New drugs that are safe, efficacious, and impact a larger proportion of individuals with PKU are needed. However, it is imperative that treatment guidelines and the decision processes for determining access to treatments be tied to a solid evidence base with rigorous standards for robust and consistent data collection. The process that preceded the PKU State-of-the-Science Conference, the conference itself, and the identification of a research agenda have facilitated the development of clinical practice guidelines by professional organizations and serve as a model for other inborn errors of metabolism.

J	Arbour, C; Gelinas, C				Arbour, Caroline; Gelinas, Celine			Behavioral and Physiologic Indicators of Pain in Nonverbal Patients with a Traumatic Brain Injury: An Integrative Review	PAIN MANAGEMENT NURSING			English	Review							INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; NURSING-RESEARCH; PROCEDURAL PAIN; SELF-REPORT; ADULT	The use of behavioral and physiologic indicators is recommended for pain assessment in nonverbal patients. Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) can lead to neurologic changes and affect the way patients respond to pain. As such, commonly used indicators of pain may not apply to TBI patients. This study aimed to review the literature about behavioral/physiologic indicators of pain in nonverbal TBIpatients. An integrative review method was used. Medline (from 1948 to June 2011), Cinahl, and Cochrane databases were searched using any combination of the terms brain injury, behavioral indicators, behavioral scale, physiologic indicators, pain, pain assessment, and pain measurement. All articles reporting expert opinion or original data about the validity of behavioral and/or physiologic indicators of pain in TBI patients were considered. For each article included, the quality of findings/clinical recommendations was graded independently by two raters using SORT taxonomy. Eight papers were reviewed. Overall, TBI patients seemed to present a wider range of behavioral reactions to pain than other adult populations. In addition to the commonly observed grimace, agitation, and increased muscle tension, 14%-72% of TBI patients showed raising eyebrows, opening eyes, weeping eyes, and absence of muscle tension when expcised to pain. Those atypical reactions appeared to be present only in the acute phase of TBIs recovery. Similarly to other populations, vital signs were identified as potential indicators of pain in TBIpatients. Further research studying TBI patients and considering changes in level of consciousness, location/severity of brain injury, and administration of analgesic/sedative is needed. Until then, nurses should follow the current clinical recommendations.

J	Ranger, M; Gelinas, C				Ranger, Manon; Gelinas, Celine			Innovating in Pain Assessment of the Critically Ill: Exploring Cerebral Near-Infrared Spectroscopy as a Bedside Approach	PAIN MANAGEMENT NURSING			English	Review							INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; HUMAN BRAIN; CLINICAL-PRACTICE; POSITION STATEMENT; 3-YEAR-OLD INFANTS; OBSERVATION TOOL; ADULT PATIENTS; SELF-REPORT; OXYGENATION; VALIDATION	Nurses play a crucial role in the evaluation and treatment of pain in the critically ill patient. This responsibility is all the more critical with this particular population because many may not be able to self-report their pain level and the typical behavioral signs of pain may be subtle or absent. According to recent recommendations, vital signs should not be used as primary indicators of pain but rather considered as a cue to begin further assessment. Other than vital signs, human brain reactivity to pain has been extensively studied with the use mainly of magnetic resonance imaging and positron-emission tomography. However, the use of these sophisticated methods may be unrealistic in the critically ill. Of interest to assessing these patients in a clinical setting is the noninvasive measurement of regional cerebral tissue oxygenation with the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique. There are indications that NIRS is capable of detecting the cerebral hemodynamic changes associated with sensory stimuli, including pain. The objective of this review paper is to provide nurses with a better understanding of NIRS technology, including a review of the literature on functional studies that have used NIRS in critically ill populations, and how it could be used in both research and practice. Current NIRS techniques have well recognized limitations which must be considered carefully during the measurement and interpretation of signals. Thus, its clinical use is yet to be fully established. Nonetheless, cerebral NIRS technique as an approach to assess brain activity in response to pain should not be abandoned.

Higher Crash and Near-Crash Rates in Teenaged Drivers With Lower Cortisol Response An 18-Month Longitudinal, Naturalistic Study	JAMA PEDIATRICS			English	Article							DELINQUENT MALE-ADOLESCENTS; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; LOW SALIVARY CORTISOL; VIOLENT OFFENDERS; RISK-TAKING; EXTERNALIZING BEHAVIOR; NOVICE DRIVERS; EARLY RELAPSE; AGGRESSION; BOYS	IMPORTANCE Road traffic crashes are one of the leading causes of injury and death among teenagers worldwide. Better understanding of the individual pathways to driving risk may lead to better-targeted intervention in this vulnerable group. OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship between cortisol, a neurobiological marker of stress regulation linked to risky behavior, and driving risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Naturalistic Teenage Driving Study was designed to continuously monitor the driving behavior of teenagers by instrumenting vehicles with kinematic sensors, cameras, and a global positioning system. During 2006-2008, a community sample of 42 newly licensed 16-year-old volunteer participants in the United States was recruited and driving behavior monitored. It was hypothesized in teenagers that higher cortisol response to stress is associated with (1) lower crash and near-crash (CNC) rates during their first 18 months of licensure and (2) faster reduction in CNC rates over time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participants' cortisol response during a stress-inducing task was assessed at baseline, followed by measurement of their involvement in CNCs and driving exposure during their first 18 months of licensure. Mixed-effect Poisson longitudinal regression models were used to examine the association between baseline cortisol response and CNC rates during the follow-up period. RESULTS Participants with a higher baseline cortisol response had lower CNC rates during the follow-up period (exponential of the regression coefficient, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98) and faster decrease in CNC rates over time (exponential of the regression coefficient, 0.98; 95%, CI, 0.96-0.99). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cortisol is a neurobiological marker associated with teenaged-driving risk. As in other problem-behavior fields, identification of an objective marker of teenaged-driving risk promises the development of more personalized intervention approaches.

J	Cohen-Adad, J				Cohen-Adad, J.			What can we learn from T-2* maps of the cortex?	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						T-2*; Cortex; Biomarker; Cytoarchitecture; Myeloarchitecture; Brodmann	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; HIGH-RESOLUTION MRI; HIGH-FIELD MRI; MYOCARDIAL IRON OVERLOAD; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; IN-VIVO VISUALIZATION; NMR RELAXATION-TIMES; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; HUMAN BRAIN	Studies have shown that T-2* contrast can reveal features of cortical anatomy. However, understanding the relationship between T-2* contrast and the underlying cyto- and myelo-architecture is not an easy task, given the number of confounds, such as myelin, iron, blood vessels and structure orientation. Moreover, it is difficult to obtain reliable T-2* measurements in the cortex due to its thin and folded geometry and the presence of artifacts. This review addresses issues associated with T-2* mapping in the human cortex. After describing the theory behind T-2* relaxation, a list of practical steps is proposed to reliably acquire and process T-2* data and then map these values within the cortex using surface-based analysis. The last section addresses the question: "What can we gain from T-2* cortical mapping?", with particular emphasis on Brodmann mapping. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Severe asphyxia is recognized as one of the risk factors of intraventricular hemorrhage in these newborns. Therapeutic hypothermia, which is the only available treatment for the limitation of brain injury in term asphyxiated newborns, may cause fluctuations of cerebral blood flow, possibly placing the newborn more at risk for intraventricular hemorrhage. The literature regarding the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage in the context of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and hypothermia is sparse. METHODS: We present a clinical observation and review the literature regarding the risk factors for intraventricular hemorrhage in term asphyxiated newborns treated with hypothermia. RESULTS: We describe the clinical course of a term newborn with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy who developed significant intraventricular hemorrhage during the rewarming period after the 72-hour hypothermia. CONCLUSION: This newborn presented several risk factors for intraventricular hemorrhage, including severe asphyxia, hemodynamic instability, hemostasis disturbances, instrument delivery, venous sinus thrombosis, and hypoglycemia. Hypothermia and rewarming also may have contributed by causing fluctuations in cerebral blood flow.

Here, we show that the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ) controls the proliferation of both hematopoietic and neural stem cells by modulating the transcriptional repression of p16(INK4a). In the absence of the HAT activity of MOZ, expression of p16(INK4a) is upregulated in progenitor and stem cells, inducing an early entrance into replicative senescence. Genetic deletion of p16(INK4a) reverses the proliferative defect in both Moz(HAT-/-) hematopoietic and neural progenitors. Our results suggest a critical requirement for MOZ HAT activity to silence p16(INK4a) expression and to protect stem cells from early entrance into replicative senescence.

METHODS: Ninety patients were randomly allocated to receive a DI (n = 45) or TII (n = 45) technique for ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block. The local anesthetic drug (lidocaine 1.5% with epinephrine 5 mu g/mL) and total volume (32 mL) were identical in all subjects. In both groups, half the volume (16 mL) was injected inside the main neural cluster. For the DI technique, the second half (16 mL) was deposited at the "corner pocket" (intersection of the first rib and subclavian artery). In contrast, for the TII technique, the remaining half was divided into equal aliquots and injected inside every single satellite cluster. The main outcome variable was the total anesthesia-related time (sum of performance and onset times). RESULTS: Due to a quicker onset (mean +/- standard deviation (SD): 10.1 +/- 6.4 vs 18.5 +/- 8.3 minutes; P < 0.0001), the total anesthesia-related time was shorter with the TII technique (21.2 +/- 7.7 vs 27.7 +/- 9.0 minutes; P = 0.001; 95% confidence interval for the difference of the means: 2.90-10.08 minutes). There were 0 (of 45) and 3 (of 45) surgical failures for the TB and DI group, respectively. Thus, the 2 methods achieved comparable rates of surgical anesthesia (93.3%-100.0%; 95% confidence interval for the difference of the success rates: -2.3% to 17.9%). No intergroup differences were observed in block-related pain scores and adverse events. The DI group required fewer needle passes (median interquartile range: 4 2 vs 7 +/- 3; P < 0.0001) as well as shorter needling (8.4 +/- 2.9 vs 10.7 +/- 2.7 minutes; P < 0.0001) and performance (9.0 +/- 3.2 vs 11.2 +/- 3.0 minutes; P = 0.001) times. CONCLUSION: Although DI and TII ultrasound-guided supraclavicular blocks seem to provide comparable success rates, we cannot exclude the possibility that an intergroup difference of 17.9% might have gone undetected. Due to its quick onset, the TII technique results in a shorter total anesthesia-related time.

This article maps these recent changes in the conceptualization of Alzheimer's disease, especially the emerging trend toward prevention. While some preventive practices (e.g., brain training) and the search for early signs and biomarkers (such as APOE epsilon 4) have existed for a long time, the recent broadening of scope to include cardiovascular risk factors and their prevention, paired with pre-symptomatic detection of disease-specific biomarkers, has considerably impacted the conventional understanding of this syndrome and the possibilities for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The rationale for emphasizing multiple logics when explaining these changes is to avoid simplified argumentative pathways that exist among some scientists.

Preclinical and human temporal bone studies have shown that there is differential damage to cochlear structures depending on the amount of dose delivered to the inner ear. In vitro studies have suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the main initial actors in radiation-induced damage. The interaction of ROS with different cellular components can result in different apoptotic pathways. Therefore, approaches to radioprotection are mainly aimed to reduce ROS production through antioxidants. This review summarizes recent research in the field that can improve the understanding and boost preventive efforts of this adverse effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Precise terminology was developed in order to improve clarity in death discussion and debate. Critical events in the physiological sequences leading to cessation of neurological and/or circulatory function were constructed. It was agreed that death determination is primarily clinical and recommendations for preconditions, confounding factors, minimum clinical standards and additional testing were made. A single operational definition of human death was developed: 'the permanent loss of capacity for consciousness and all brainstem functions, as a consequence of permanent cessation of circulation or catastrophic brain injury'. In order to complete the project, in the next phase, a broader group of international stakeholders will develop clinical practice guidelines, based on comprehensive reviews and grading of the existing evidence.

We would like to acknowledge Dr. Marti Manyalich, who represented Spain as a meeting participant, but subsequently requested removal from the authorship list. Funding for this meeting has been provided by Canadian Blood Services. Canadian Blood Services is a national, not-for-profit charitable organization that manages the supply of blood and blood products in all provinces and territories in Canada (with the exception of Quebec) and oversees the OneMatch Stem Cell and Marrow Network. Canadian Blood Services also received a mandate in 2008 for national activities related to organ and tissue donation and transplantation (OTDT), which includes development of leading practices, public awareness, and education, system performance measurement, and establishing patient registries. Canadian Blood Services is not responsible for the management or funding of any Canadian Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) or Transplant Programs. Canadian Blood Services is an agency that receives its funding from the provincial and territorial Ministries of Health and the federal government, through Health Canada. The following organizations kindly provided travelling expenses for their representatives to attend this meeting: Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, International Federation of Emergency Medicine, International Pan Arab Critical Care Medicine Society, Neurocritical Care Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, World Federation of Neurology, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies, World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies, World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine. It is recognized that pursuit of best practices related to death determination is most often administered by those acute care practitioners who are also involved with deceased donation practices and policy. Given concerns about potential conflict of interest, there has been a deliberate effort to exclude the involvement of transplant programs in this process. In support of the overall planning process, the following groups have been involved in their respective roles: The International Society for Organ Donation and Procurement (ISODP). The mission of ISODP includes promotion of high ethical standards in transplantation, as both donor and recipient are members of a community where equity and justice are equally important to success. The development of international guidelines for determination of death supports this goal. ISODP provided travel funds for its representative. No other funding for the meeting has been received from ISODP. The Transplantation Society (TTS), together with the WHO, has played a role in moving the international dialogue on transplant tourism forward. They have been active in the development of the Istanbul and Madrid accords and as a result have a breadth and depth of knowledge of practices across the globe. Francis Delmonico, their president, has provided counsel as part of the international advisory committee but was not a participant at the meeting.

To our knowledge, the genes predisposing individuals to AD and predicting disease incidence remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the genetic contribution of mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene exons 16 and 17 to familial and sporadic AD cases. Seventeen sporadic cases and eight family cases were seen at the memory clinic of the University of Casablanca Neurology Department. These patients underwent standard somatic neurological examination, cognitive function assessment, brain imaging, and laboratory tests. Direct sequencing of exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene was performed on genomic DNA of AD patients. In this original Moroccan study, we identified seven novel frameshift mutations in exons 16 and 17 of the APP gene. Interestingly, only one novel splice mutation was detected in a family case. There is a strong correlation between clinical symptoms and genetic factors in Moroccan patients with a family history of AD. Therefore, mutations in APP gene exons 16 and 17 may eventually become genetic markers for AD predisposition.

Reports of substantial variability of the morphology of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses are accumulating, suggesting that the use of a single generic model of the expected response in general linear model (GLM) analyses does not provide optimal sensitivity due to model misspecification. Relaxing assumptions of the model can limit the impact of hemodynamic response function (HRF) variability, but at a cost on model parsimony. Alternatively, better specification of the model could be obtained from a priori knowledge of the HRF of a given subject, but the effectiveness of this approach has only been tested on simulation data. Using fast BOLD fMRI, we characterized the variability of hemodynamic responses to a simple event-related auditory-motor task, as well as its effect on activation detection with GLM analyses. We show the variability to be higher between subjects than between regions and variation in different regions to correlate from one subject to the other. Accounting for subject-related variability by deriving subject-specific models from responses to the task in some regions lead to more sensitive detection of responses in other regions. We applied the approach to epilepsy patients, where task-derived patient-specific models provided additional information compared to the use of a generic model for the detection of BOLD responses to epileptiform activity identified on scalp electro-encephalogram (EEG). This work highlights the importance of improving the accuracy of the model for detecting neuronal activation with fMRI, and the fact that it can be done at no cost to model parsimony through the acquisition of independent a priori information about the hemodynamic response.

A meta-analysis of neuropsychological markers of vulnerability to suicidal behavior in mood disorders	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Cognitive control; decision making; mood disorders; neuropsychology; suicidal behaviour; vulnerability	IMPAIRED DECISION-MAKING; BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COGNITIVE INHIBITION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; VERBAL FLUENCY; FRONTAL LOBES; ATTEMPTERS	Background Suicidal behavior results from a complex interplay between stressful events and vulnerability factors, including cognitive deficits. However, it is not clear which cognitive tests may best reveal this vulnerability. The objective was to identify neuropsychological tests of vulnerability to suicidal acts in patients with mood disorders. Method A search was made of Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases, and article references. A total of 25 studies (2323 participants) met the selection criteria. A total of seven neuropsychological tests [Iowa gambling task (IGT), Stroop test, trail making test part B, Wisconsin card sorting test, category and semantic verbal fluencies, and continuous performance test] were used in at least three studies to be analysed. Results IGT and category verbal fluency performances were lower in suicide attempters than in patient controls [respectively, g=-0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.65 to -0.29 and g=-0.32, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.04] and healthy controls, with no difference between the last two groups. Stroop performance was lower in suicide attempters than in patient controls (g=0.37, 95% CI 0.10-0.63) and healthy controls, with patient controls scoring lower than healthy controls. The four other tests were altered in both patient groups versus healthy controls but did not differ between patient groups. Conclusions Deficits in decision-making, category verbal fluency and the Stroop interference test were associated with histories of suicidal behavior in patients with mood disorders. Altered value-based and cognitive control processes may be important factors of suicidal vulnerability. These tests may also have the potential of guiding therapeutic interventions and becoming part of future systematic assessment of suicide risk.	[Richard-Devantoy, S.; Berlim, M.

Many post-hoc explanations for CB bloom occurrence relating to physical and biochemical conditions in lakes have been developed. As potentially toxic CB can accumulate in drinking water treatment plants and disrupt water treatment, there is a need for water treatment operators to determine whether conditions are favourable for the proliferation and accumulation of CB in source waters in order to adjust drinking water treatment accordingly. Thus, a new methodology with locally adaptable variables is proposed in order to have a single index, f(p), related to various environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed and direction. The index is used in conjunction with real time monitoring data to determine the probability of CB occurrence in relation to meteorological factors, and was tested at a drinking water intake in Missisquoi Bay, a shallow transboundary bay in Lake Champlain, Quebec, Canada. These environmental factors alone were able to explain a maximum probability of 68% that a CB bloom would occur at the drinking water treatment plant. Nutrient limitation also influences CB blooms and intense blooms only occurred when the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to total phosphorus (TP) mass ratio was below 3. Additional monitoring of DIN and TP could be considered for these source waters prone to cyanobacterial blooms to determine periods of favourable growth. Real time monitoring and the use of the index could permit an adequate and timely response to CB blooms in drinking water sources. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Organized into Working Groups that tackle questions in neuroscience, genetics, and medicine, ENIGMA studies have analyzed neuroimaging data from over 12,826 subjects. In addition, data from 12,171 individuals were provided by the CHARGE consortium for replication of findings, in a total of 24,997 subjects. By meta-analyzing results from many sites, ENIGMA has detected factors that affect the brain that no individual site could detect on its own, and that require larger numbers of subjects than any individual neuroimaging study has currently collected. ENIGMA's first project was a genome-wide association study identifying common variants in the genome associated with hippocampal volume or intracranial volume. Continuing work is exploring genetic associations with subcortical volumes (ENIGMA2) and white matter microstructure (ENIGMA-DTI). Working groups also focus on understanding how schizophrenia, bipolar illness, major depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the brain.

Heritable changes in regional cortical thickness with age	BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Cortical Thickness; Heritability; Genotype by; Age Interaction; Clustering	AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; HUMAN BRAIN; SURFACE-AREA; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; GENETIC INFLUENCES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MRI; NETWORKS; TWIN; REGISTRATION	It is now well established that regional indices of brain structure such as cortical thickness, surface area or grey matter volume exhibit spatially variable patterns of heritability. However, a recent study found these patterns to change with age during development, a result supported by gene expression studies. Changes in heritability have not been investigated in adulthood so far and could have important implications in the study of heritability and genetic correlations in the brain as well as in the discovery of specific genes explaining them. Herein, we tested for genotype by age (G xA) interactions, an extension of genotype by environment interactions, through adulthood and healthy aging in 902 subjects from the Genetics of Brain Structure (GOBS) study. A "jackknife" based method for the analysis of stable cortical thickness clusters (JASC) and scale selection is also introduced. Although additive genetic variance remained constant throughout adulthood, we found evidence for incomplete pleiotropy across age in the cortical thickness of paralimbic and parieto-temporal areas. This suggests that different genetic factors account for cortical thickness heritability at different ages in these regions.

Methods: EEG recordings were obtained between 2 and 14 days of life in 47 preterm (<37 weeks) very low birth weight (<= 1500 g) newborns and repeated when reaching term age (38-42 weeks) in a subsample (n = 22). EEG recordings were also obtained in term newborns. Clinical evaluation was performed at birth and at 6 and 12 months. Results: Relative to the first EEG, preterm newborns showed a reduction in delta brushes and interburst intervals and increased interhemispheric synchrony, suggesting an improvement in EEG maturation. Further organization in sleep patterns, like a reduction in total sleep time and phase shifts, were also observed. However, when reaching term, preterm newborns still had less mature EEG patterns, phase shifts and transitional sleep than matched controls. Background abnormalities and dysmaturity in preterm newborns during the first EEG predicted adverse neurological outcome later on. Conclusions: EEG patterns in preterm very low birth weight newborns might be influenced by extra uterine development. Specific EEG abnormalities are related to increased risk of neurological disorders. Significance: Extra uterine development of very low birth weight delays the acquisition of maturational EEG patterns. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

These metabolic disorders are generally reflected by natriuretic peptide system deficiency. Since brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is known to influence metabolism and cardioprotection, we investigated the effect of chronic exogenous BNP treatment on adverse myocardial consequences related to obesity and diabetes. Methods Ten-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db obese diabetic mice (db/db) and their lean control littermates (db/+) were treated with BNP (0.6 mu g kg(-1) h(-1)) or saline for 12 weeks (n=10/group). Serial blood and tomography analysis were performed. Cardiac function was determined by echocardiography, and biochemical and histological heart and fat analyses were also performed. Results BNP treatment resulted in an average increase in plasma BNP levels of 70 pg/ml. An improvement in the metabolic profile of db/db mice was observed, including a reduction in fat content, increased insulin sensitivity, improved glucose tolerance and lower blood glucose, despite increased food intake. db/db mice receiving saline displayed both early systolic and diastolic dysfunction, whereas these functional changes were prevented by BNP treatment. The cardioprotective effects of BNP were attributed to the inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, myocardial fibrosis, cardiac hypertrophy and the AGE-receptor for AGE (RAGE) system as well as normalisation of cardiac AMP-activated protein kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activities. Conclusions/interpretation Our results indicate that chronic BNP treatment at low dose improves the metabolic profile and prevents the development of myocardial dysfunction in db/db mice.

Histopathologic Changes in the Cochlea Associated With Diabetes Mellitus-A Review	OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY			English	Review						Animal models; Cochlea; Diabetes mellitus; Hearing; Human temporal bones; Inner ear; Pathology	OUTER HAIR-CELLS; NA+-GLUCOSE COTRANSPORTERS; SENSORINEURAL HEARING-LOSS; EAR DAMAGE SECONDARY; SHR/N-CP RATS; STRIA VASCULARIS; INNER-EAR; BASEMENT-MEMBRANE; DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION; SUGAR TRANSPORTER	Background: The pathologic changes that occur as a result of diabetic microangiopathy have been well described for the kidneys and the eyes. Although many studies suggest an association between diabetes mellitus and hearing loss, the pathologic changes in the cochlea in association with the diabetic state remain to be clarified. Aim/Objective: The aim of this review is to determine the effects of diabetes mellitus on cochlear morphology. Method: A comprehensive search for relevant articles was carried out on electronic databases of Ovid Medline, Ovid Medline in Process, PubMed, Ovid Embase, or Biosis Preview, The Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus. Articles published in English between 1940 and June 2010 were eligible to be reviewed. Using predefined inclusion criteria, published articles on histologic changes occurring in the cochlea due to diabetes mellitus were selected and reviewed, and their findings were synthesized. Results: Changes were observed in the basement membrane of the capillaries of the stria vascularis and in the basilar membrane, which was remarkably thickened, giving rise to diabetic microangiopathy. Loss of spiral ganglion neurons, organ of Corti cells, and atrophic changes in the stria vascularis were varied and infrequent. Conclusion: There seems to be variable vulnerability of different cochlear cell types to the DM state. Further studies are required to determine the factors responsible for the differences in the histopathologic observations of cochlear tissues.

Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE was used to conduct a thorough search of English-language publications dating from 1948 to February 2013. Study Selection: Patients must have had useful hearing at diagnosis and treated with one of the 4 treatments as their primary therapy. All sporadic vestibular schwannoma cases were excluded. Data Extraction: A total of 19 articles were reviewed. Hearing preservation was defined as unchanged or improved useful hearing. Tumor control was defined as no change in size or tumor regression for SR, CM, and ChT-treated cases, and as no recurrence for MS treated cases. Conclusion: Microsurgery seems to have the worse overall results, while SR has very good tumor control with poor useful hearing preservation. If a patient qualifies for CM, he is likely to show the most satisfactory results with the least treatment available. A close follow-up on ChT clinical trials and possible side-effects is warranted as preliminary short-term results are quite favorable. Additional long-term studies are required for a better understanding of this disease.

The present study aimed at characterizing the neuroanatomical basis of socioemotional dysfunctions in TS using the Emotional Quotient inventory (EQ-I) and cortical morphology analysis in 17 individuals with TS (45,X) and 17-age and verbal IQ matched healthy females. Individuals with TS reported significantly greater socioemotional impairment than controls. Cortical thickness analysis showed that participants with TS had an overall thicker cortex than controls, with extensive alterations in the temporal, frontal, parietal and insular regions bilaterally. Using the total EQ-I score as regressor in the cortical thickness analysis revealed a number of brain regions where the relationship between cortical thickness and EQ-I score differed between groups; these areas included brain regions critically involved in socioemotional processes, such as bilateral insula, the anterior cingulate and the orbitofrontal cortex. These results show that socioemotional dysfunctions seen in women with TS are associated with significant alterations in brain morphology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Examining dorsal striatum in cognitive effort using Parkinson's disease and fMRI	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article								Objective: Understanding cognition mediated by the striatum can clarify cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previously, we claimed that dorsal striatum (DS) mediates cognitive flexibility. To refute the possibility that variation in cognitive effort confounded our observations, we reexamined our data to dissociate cognitive flexibility from effort. PD provides a model for exploring DS-mediated functions. In PD, dopamine-producing cells supplying DS are significantly degenerated. DS-mediated functions are impaired off and improved on dopamine replacement medication. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can confirm striatum-mediated functions. Methods: Twenty-two PD patients, off-on dopaminergic medication, and 22 healthy age-matched controls performed a number selection task. Numerical distance between number pairs varied systematically. Selecting between two numbers that are closer versus distant in magnitude is more effortful: the symbolic distance effect. However, selecting between closer versus distant number pairs is equivalent in the need to alter attention or response strategies (i.e., cognitive flexibility). In Experiment 2, 28 healthy participants performed the same task with simultaneous measurement of brain activity with fMRI. Results: The symbolic distance effect was equivalent for PD versus control participants and across medication sessions. Furthermore, symbolic distance did not correlate with DS activation using fMRI. In this dataset, we showed previously that integrating conflicting influences on decision making is (1) impaired in PD and improved by dopaminergic therapy and (2) associated with preferential DS activation using fMRI. Interpretation: These findings support the notion that DS mediates cognitive flexibility specifically, not merely cognitive effort, accounting for some cognitive deficits in PD and informing treatment.

Both incontinence and EF declines increase fall risk. The current study assessed EF and dual-task gait after a multicomponent intervention that combined pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training and videogame dancing (VGD). Materials and Methods: Baseline (Pre1), pretraining (Pre2), and post-training (Post) neuropsychological and dual-task gait assessments were completed by 23 women (mean age, 70.4 years) with MUI. During the dual-task, participants walked and performed an auditory n-back task. From Pre2 to Post, all women completed 12 weeks of combined PFM and VGD training. Results: After training (Pre2 to Post), the number of errors in the Inhibition/Switch Stroop condition decreased significantly, the Trail Making Test difference score improved marginally, and the number of n-back errors during dual-task gait significantly decreased. A subgroup analysis based on continence improvements (pad test) revealed that only those subjects who improved in the pad test had significantly reduced numbers of n-back errors during dual-task gait. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that a multicomponent intervention can improve EFs and the dual-task gait of older women with MUI. Future research is needed to determine if the training-induced improvements in these factors reduce fall risk.

Effect of changes in orientation and position of external loads on trunk muscle activity and kinematics in upright standing	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY			English	Article						Electromyography; Trunk muscles; Force orientation; Kinematics; L5-S1 moment; Force position	LIFTING TASKS; LUMBAR SPINE; SURFACE EMG; STABILITY; FORCE; COACTIVATION; MODEL	Forces at different heights and orientations are often carried by hands while performing occupational tasks. Trunk muscle activity and spinal loads are likely dependent on not only moments but also the orientation and height of these forces. Here, we measured trunk kinematics and select superficial muscle activity of 12 asymptomatic subjects while supporting forces in hands in upright standing. Magnitude of forces in 5 orientations (-25 degrees, 0 degrees,25 degrees, 50 degrees and 90 degrees) and 2 heights (20 cm and 40 cm) were adjusted to generate flexion moments of 15, 30 and 45 N m at the L5-S1 disc centre. External forces were of much greater magnitude when applied at lower elevation or oriented upward at 25 degrees. Spinal kinematics remained nearly unchanged in various tasks. Changes in orientation and elevation of external forces substantially influenced the recorded EMG, despite similar trunk posture and identical moments at the L5-S1. Greater EMG activity was overall recorded under larger forces albeit constant moment. Increases in the external moment at the L5-S1 substantially increased EMG in extensor muscles (p < 0.001) but had little effect on abdominals; e. g., mean longissimus EMG for all orientations increased by 38% and 75% as the moment level altered from 15 N m to 30 N m and to 45 N m while that in the rectus abdominus increased only by 2% and 4%, respectively. Under 45 N m moment and as the load orientation altered from 90 degrees to 50 degrees, 25 degrees, 0 degrees and -25 degrees, mean EMG dropped by 3%, 12%, 12% and 1% in back muscles and by 17%, 17%, 19% and 13% in abdominals, respectively. As the load elevation increased from 20 cm to 40 cm, mean EMG under maximum moment decreased by 21% in back muscles and by 17% in abdominals. Due to the lack of EMG recording of deep lumbar muscles, changes in relative shear/compression components and different net moments at cranial discs despite identical moments at the caudal L5-S1 disc, complementary model studies are essential for a better comprehension of neuromuscular strategies in response to alterations in load height and orientation.

The trunk neuromuscular and kinematics responses are likely influenced by the perturbation itself as well as initial trunk conditions. The effect of four parameters (preload, sudden load, initial trunk flexed posture, initial abdominal antagonistic activity) on trunk kinematics and back muscles reflex response were evaluated. Twelve asymptomatic subjects participated in sudden forward perturbation tests under six distinct conditions. Preload did not change the reflexive response of back muscles and the trunk displacement; while peak trunk velocity and acceleration as well as the relative load peak decreased. Sudden load increased reflex response of muscles, trunk kinematics and loading variables. When the trunk was initially flexed, back muscles latency was delayed, trunk velocity and acceleration increased; however, reflex amplitude and relative trunk displacement remained unchanged. Abdominal antagonistic preactivation increased reflexive response of muscles but kinematics variables were not affected. Preload, initial flexed posture and abdominal muscles preactivation increased back muscles preactivity. Both velocity and acceleration peaks of the trunk movement decreased with preload despite greater total load. In contrast, they increased in the initial flexed posture and to some extent when abdominal muscles were preactivated demonstrating the distinct effects of pre-perturbation variables on trunk kinematics and risk of injury.

In total 181 genes with at least a two-fold increase in expression were identified, and most of these genes were associated with immune function. Unexpectedly, ceruloplasmin (Cp), a ferroxidase that converts toxic ferrous iron to its nontoxic ferric form and also promotes the efflux of iron from astrocytes in the CNS, was shown to be highly upregulated (13.2-fold increase) in EAE spinal cord. Expression of Cp protein is known to be increased in several neurological conditions, but the role of Cp regulation in CNS autoimmune disease is not known. To investigate this, we induced EAE in Cp gene knockout, heterozygous, and wild-type mice. Cp knockout mice were found to have slower disease evolution than wild-type mice (EAE days 13-17; P = 0.05). Interestingly, Cp knockout mice also exhibited a significant increase in the number of astrocytes with reactive morphology in early EAE compared with wild-type mice at the same stage of disease. CNS iron levels were not increased with EAE in these mice. Based on these observations, we propose that an increase in Cp expression could contribute to tissue damage in early EAE. In addition, endogenous CP either directly or indirectly inhibits astrocyte reactivity during early disease, which could also worsen early disease evolution. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this way, dopamine can act as a learning signal that can shape behaviors to maximize rewards and avoid punishments. Dopamine is also thought to invigorate reward seeking behavior. Loss of dopamine signaling is the major abnormality in Parkinson's disease. Dopamine agonists have been implicated in the occurrence of impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease patients, the most common being pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, and compulsive buying. Recently, a number of functional imaging studies investigating impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease have been published. Here we review this literature, and attempt to place in within a decision-making framework in which potential gains and losses are evaluated to arrive at optimum choices. We also provide a hypothetical but still incomplete model on the effect of dopamine agonist treatment on these value and risk assessments. Two of the main brain structures thought to be involved in computing aspects of reward and loss are the ventral striatum (VStr) and the insula, both dopamine projection sites. Both structures are consistently implicated in functional brain imaging studies of pathological gambling in Parkinson's disease.

The First Episode Social Functioning Scale (FESFS) was developed to cover many domains specific to this population in their contemporary reality. The self-report version of the FESFS was administered to 203 individuals receiving services in first episode clinics. Scores of the GAF, SOFAS, Social Functioning Scale and BPRS were also obtained for parts of the sample to calculate convergent and discriminant validity. A subgroup also answered the FESFS at several time points during treatment in order to determine sensibility to change. Principal component factor analyses and internal consistency analyses revealed the following nine factors with alphas ranging from 0.63 to 0.80: Friendships and social activities, Independent living skills, Interacting with people, Family, Intimacy, Relationships and social activities at work, Work abilities, Relationships and social activities at school, Educational abilities. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated, as well as sensitivity to change. Clinical and research utility of the FESFS are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we show that 5hmC and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) levels are coordinately distributed in gene promoters of the rhesus macaque prefrontal cortex. Although promoter hydroxymethylation and methylation are overall negatively correlated with expression, a subset of highly expressed genes involved in specific cerebral functions is associated with high levels of 5mC and 5hmC. These relationships were also observed in the mouse cortex. Furthermore, we found that early-life maternal deprivation is associated, in the adult monkey cortex, with DNA hydroxymethylation changes of promoters of genes related to neurological functions and psychological disorders.

However, the fundamental knowledge concerning the mechanisms that govern feature-encoding by these sub-networks is still sparse. Here, we show through multi-electrode recordings in V1 of conventionally prepared anesthetized cats, that an avalanche of synergistic neural activity occurs between functionally connected neurons in a cell-assembly in response to the presented stimulus. The results specifically show that once the reference neuron spikes in a connected neuron-pair, it facilitates the response of its companion (target) neuron for 50 ms and, thereafter, the excitability of the target neuron declines. On the other hand, the functionally unconnected neurons do not facilitate each other's activity within the 50-ms time-window. The added excitation (facilitation) of connected neurons is almost four times the responsiveness of unconnected neurons. This suggests that connectedness confers the added excitability to neurons; consequently leading to feature-encoding within the emergent 50-ms-period. Furthermore, the facilitation significantly decreases as a function of orientation selectivity spread. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recent models of visual perception emphasize the role of top-down predictions facilitating object recognition via initial guesses that limit the number of object representations that need to be considered. Several results suggest that this rapid and efficient object processing relies on the early extraction and processing of low spatial frequencies (LSF). The present study aimed to investigate the SF content of visual object representations and its modulation by contextual and affective values of the perceived object during a picture-name verification task. Stimuli consisted of pictures of objects equalized in SF content and categorized as having low or high affective and contextual values. To access the SF content of stored visual representations of objects, SFs of each image were then randomly sampled on a trial-by-trial basis. Results reveal that intermediate SFs between 14 and 24 cycles per object (2.3-4 cycles per degree) are correlated with fast and accurate identification for all categories of objects. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between affective and contextual values over the SFs correlating with fast recognition. These results suggest that affective and contextual values of a visual object modulate the SF content of its internal representation, thus highlighting the flexibility of the visual recognition system.

Here we test the boundaries of this phenomenon, which we term neuroenchantment. How much are individuals ready to believe when encountering improbable information through the guise of neuroscience? We introduced participants to a crudely-built mock brain scanner, explaining that the machine would measure neural activity, analyze the data, and then infer the content of complex thoughts. Using a classic magic trick, we crafted an illusion whereby the imaging technology seemed to decipher the internal thoughts of participants. We found that most students-even undergraduates with advanced standing in neuroscience and psychology, who have been taught the shortcomings of neuroimaging-deemed such unlikely technology highly plausible. Our findings highlight the influence neuro-hype wields over critical thinking.

In this study, we investigated what brain processes allow listeners to detect when a spoken compliment is meant to be sincere (true compliment) or not ("white lie"). Electroencephalograms of 29 participants were recorded while they listened to Question-Response pairs, where the response was expressed in either a sincere or insincere tone (e.g., "So, what did you think of my presentation?"/"I found it really interesting."). Participants judged whether the response was sincere or not. Behavioral results showed that prosody could be effectively used to discern the intended sincerity of compliments. Analysis of temporal and spatial characteristics of event-related potentials (P200, N400, P600) uncovered significant effects of prosody on P600 amplitudes, which were greater in response to sincere versus insincere compliments. Using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA), we determined that the anatomical sources of this activity were likely located in the (left) insula, consistent with previous reports of insular activity in the perception of lies and concealments. These data extend knowledge of the neurocognitive mechanisms that permit context-appropriate inferences about speaker feelings and intentions during interpersonal communication.

We identified a subpopulation of neurons within this structure that coexpresses Vglut2 and Pitx2, and by conditional targeting of this subpopulation we reduced Vglut2 expression levels in the STN by 40%, leaving Pitx2 expression intact. This reduction diminished, yet did not eliminate, glutamatergic transmission in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and entopeduncular nucleus, two major targets of the STN. The knockout mice displayed hyperlocomotion and decreased latency in the initiation of movement while preserving normal gait and balance. Spatial cognition, social function, and level of impulsive choice also remained undisturbed. Furthermore, these mice showed reduced dopamine transporter binding and slower dopamine clearance in vivo, suggesting that Vglut2-expressing cells in the STN regulate dopaminergic transmission. Our results demonstrate that altering the contribution of a limited population within the STN is sufficient to achieve results similar to STN lesions and high-frequency stimulation, but with fewer side effects.

The extraction of patterns of interest and dynamic features from these cortical signals has so far relied on the expertise of investigators. There is a definite need in both clinical and neuroscience research for a method that will extract critical features from high-dimensional neuroimaging data in an automatic fashion. We have previously demonstrated the use of optical flow techniques for evaluating the kinematic properties of motion field projected on non-flat manifolds like in a cortical surface. We have further extended this framework to automatically detect features in the optical flow vector field by using the modified and extended 2-Riemannian Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (HHD). Here, we applied these mathematical models on simulation and MEG data recorded from a healthy individual during a somatosensory experiment and an epilepsy pediatric patient during sleep. We tested whether our technique can automatically extract salient dynamical features of cortical activity. Simulation results indicated that we can precisely reproduce the simulated cortical dynamics with HHD; encode them in sparse features and represent the propagation of brain activity between distinct cortical areas. Using HHD, we decoded the somatosensory N20 component into two HHD features and represented the dynamics of brain activity as a traveling source between two primary somatosensory regions. In the epilepsy patient, we displayed the propagation of the epileptic activity around the margins of a brain lesion. Our findings indicate that HHD measures computed from cortical dynamics can: (i) quantitatively access the cortical dynamics in both healthy and disease brain in terms of sparse features and dynamic brain activity propagation between distinct cortical areas, and (ii) facilitate a reproducible, automated analysis of experimental and clinical MEG/EEG source imaging data.

Chronicity of pain is associated with changes in the central nervous system related to central sensitization, which have to be quantified. Our objectives were 1) to develop a quantitative sensory testing device in cats for applying repetitive mechanical stimuli that would evoke temporal summation; 2) to determine the sensitivity of this test to osteoarthritis-associated pain, and 3) to examine the possible correlation between the quantitative sensory testing and assessment using other pain evaluation methods. We hypothesized that mechanical sub-threshold repetitive stimuli would evoke temporal summation, and that cats with osteoarthritis would show a faster response. A blinded longitudinal study was performed in 4 non-osteoarthritis cats and 10 cats with naturally occurring osteoarthritis. Quantification of chronic osteoarthritis pain-related disability was performed over a two week period using peak vertical force kinetic measurement, motor activity intensity assessment and von Frey anesthesiometer-induced paw withdrawal threshold testing. The cats afflicted with osteoarthritis demonstrated characteristic findings consistent with osteoarthritis-associated chronic pain. After a 14-day acclimation period, repetitive mechanical sub-threshold stimuli were applied using a purpose-developed device. Four stimulation profiles of predetermined intensity, duration and time interval were applied randomly four times during a four-day period. The stimulation profiles were different (P<0.001): the higher the intensity of the stimulus, the sooner it produced a consistent painful response. The cats afflicted with osteoarthritis responded more rapidly than cats osteoarthritis free (P = 0.019). There was a positive correlation between the von Frey anesthesiometer-induced paw withdrawal threshold and the response to stimulation profiles #2 (2N/0.4 Hz) and #4 (2N/0.4 Hz): Rho(s) = 0.64 (P = 0.01) and 0.63 (P = 0.02) respectively. This study is the first report of mechanical temporal summation in awake cats.

Rapid Hebbian axonal remodeling mediated by visual stimulation	SCIENCE			English	Article							RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS DISRUPT; NMDA RECEPTOR; MAP FORMATION; IN-VIVO; RETINOTECTAL SYSTEM; TOPOGRAPHIC MAP; EXPERIENCE; INFUSION; ARBORS; MICE	We examined how correlated firing controls axon remodeling, using in vivo time-lapse imaging and electrophysiological analysis of individual retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons that were visually stimulated either synchronously or asynchronously relative to neighboring inputs in the Xenopus laevis optic tectum. RGCs stimulated out of synchrony rapidly lost the ability to drive tectal postsynaptic partners while their axons grew and added many new branches. In contrast, synchronously activated RGCs produced fewer new branches, but these were more stable. The effects of synchronous activation were prevented by the inhibition of neurotransmitter release and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade, which is consistent with a role for synaptic NMDAR activation in the stabilization of axonal branches and suppression of further exploratory branch addition.

J	Landry, SP; Guillemot, JP; Champoux, F				Landry, Simon P.; Guillemot, Jean-Paul; Champoux, Francois			Audiotactile interaction can change over time in cochlear implant users	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						audiotactile interaction; multisensory interactions; cochlear implant; parchment-skin illusion; sensory deprivation; cross-modal plasticity; deafness; hearing loss	PRELINGUALLY DEAF-CHILDREN; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; SIGN-LANGUAGE; HEARING; ADULTS; INDIVIDUALS; BRAIN; ACTIVATION	Recent results suggest that audiotactile interactions are disturbed in cochlear implant (Cl) users. However, further exploration regarding the factors responsible for such abnormal sensory processing is still required. Considering the temporal nature of a previously used multisensory task, it remains unclear whether any aberrant results were caused by the specificity of the interaction studied or rather if it reflects an overall abnormal interaction. Moreover, although duration of experience with a CI has often been linked with the recovery of auditory functions, its impact on multisensory performance remains uncertain. In the present study, we used the parchment-skin illusion, a robust illustration of sound-biased perception of touch based on changes in auditory frequencies, to investigate the specificities of audiotactile interactions in CI users. Whereas individuals with relatively little experience with the CI performed similarly to the control group, experienced CI users showed a significantly greater illusory percept. The overall results suggest that despite being able to ignore auditory distractors in a temporal audiotactile task, CI users develop to become greatly influenced by auditory input in a spectral audiotactile task. When considered with the existing body of research, these results confirm that normal sensory interaction processing can be compromised in CI users.

J	Levesque, J; Theoret, H; Champoux, F				Levesque, Justine; Theoret, Hugo; Champoux, Franois			Reduced procedural motor learning in deaf individuals	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deafness; cochlear implant; hearing loss; motor learning; plasticity; sensory deprivation; serial reaction time task	CROSS-MODAL PLASTICITY; COCHLEAR IMPLANT USERS; HEARING CHILDREN; PERFORMANCE; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; SKILLS; BRAIN	Studies in the deaf suggest that cross-modal neuroplastic changes may vary across modalities. Only a handful of studies have examined motor capacities in the profoundly deaf. These studies suggest the presence of deficits in manual dexterity and delays in movement production. As of yet, the ability to learn complex sequential motor patterns has not been explored in deaf populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the procedural learning skills of deaf adults. A serial reaction-time task (SRTT) was performed by 18 deaf subjects and 18 matched controls to investigate possible motor alteration subsequent to auditory deprivation. Deaf participants had various degrees of hearing loss. Half of the experimental group were early deaf adults mostly using hearing aids, the remaining half were late-deaf adults using a cochlear implant (CI). Participants carried out a repeating 12-item sequence of key presses along with random blocks containing no repeating sequence. Non-specific and sequence-specific learning was analyzed in relation to individual features related to the hearing loss. The results revealed significant differences between groups in sequence-specific learning, with deaf subjects being less efficient than controls in acquiring sequence-specific knowledge. We interpret the results in light of cross-modal plasticity and the auditory scaffolding hypothesis.

Although they were affected by conjugation, the binding affinities were found to be still in the nanomolar range (between 1.5 and 64.2 nM). In addition, homology modeling of the receptor and docking studies for the most potent compounds were performed, elucidating the binding modes of the fusion molecules and the structure elements contributing to the observed high receptor binding. Furthermore, no interaction between the hybrid compounds and P-gp, the main excretory transporter of the BBB, was found. From these results, it can be inferred that the approach to deliver small neuroreceptor ligands across the BBB by transport peptide carriers is feasible.

CBRAIN: a web-based, distributed computing platform for collaborative neuroimaging research	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						eScience; distributed computing; meta-scheduler; collaborative platform; interoperability; cloud computing; neuroimaging; visualization	IMAGE-ANALYSIS	The Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platform (CBRAIN) is a web-based collaborative research platform developed in response to the challenges raised by data-heavy, compute-intensive neuroimaging research. CBRAIN offers transparent access to remote data sources, distributed computing sites, and an array of processing and visualization tools within a controlled, secure environment. Its web interface is accessible through any modern browser and uses graphical interface idioms to reduce the technical expertise required to perform large-scale computational analyses. CBRAIN's flexible meta-scheduling has allowed the incorporation of a wide range of heterogeneous computing sites, currently including nine national research High Performance Computing (HPC) centers in Canada, one in Korea, one in Germany, and several local research servers. CBRAIN leverages remote computing cycles and facilitates resource-interoperability in a transparent manner for the end-user. Compared with typical grid solutions available, our architecture was designed to be easily extendable and deployed on existing remote computing sites with no tool modification, administrative intervention, or special software/hardware configuration. As October 2013, CBRAIN serves over 200 users spread across 53 cities in 17 countries. The platform is built as a generic framework that can accept data and analysis tools from any discipline. However, its current focus is primarily on neuroimaging research and studies of neurological diseases such as Autism, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, Multiple Sclerosis as well as on normal brain structure and development. This technical report presents the CBRAIN Platform, its current deployment and usage and future direction.

Cognitive evolution has been explained at the proximate level by shifts in absolute and relative brain volume and at the ultimate level by differences in social and dietary complexity. However, no study has integrated the experimental and phylogenetic approach at the scale required to rigorously test these explanations. Instead, previous research has largely relied on various measures of brain size as proxies for cognitive abilities. We experimentally evaluated these major evolutionary explanations by quantitatively comparing the cognitive performance of 567 individuals representing 36 species on two problem-solving tasks measuring self-control. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that absolute brain volume best predicted performance across species and accounted for considerably more variance than brain volume controlling for body mass. This result corroborates recent advances in evolutionary neurobiology and illustrates the cognitive consequences of cortical reorganization through increases in brain volume. Within primates, dietary breadth but not social group size was a strong predictor of species differences in self-control. Our results implicate robust evolutionary relationships between dietary breadth, absolute brain volume, and self-control. These findings provide a significant first step toward quantifying the primate cognitive phenome and explaining the process of cognitive evolution.

Big data, open science and the brain: lessons learned from genomics	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						open neuroscience; open science; data sharing; neuroimaging; human genome project; brain initiative; human brain project	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EMERGE CONSORTIUM; WIDE ASSOCIATION; WORKING-MEMORY; FMRI; NEUROSCIENCE; PERSONALITY; GENETICS; PROJECT; SCHIZOPHRENIA	The BRAIN Initiative aims to break new ground in the scale and speed of data collection in neuroscience, requiring tools to handle data in the magnitude of yottabytes (10(24)). The scale, investment and organization of it are being compared to the Human Genome Project (HGP), which has exemplified "big science" for biology. In line with the trend towards Big Data in genomic research, the promise of the BRAIN Initiative, as well as the European Human Brain Project, rests on the possibility to amass vast quantities of data to model the complex interactions between the brain and behavior and inform the diagnosis and prevention of neurological disorders and psychiatric disease. Advocates of this "data driven" paradigm in neuroscience argue that harnessing the large quantities of data generated across laboratories worldwide has numerous methodological, ethical and economic advantages, but it requires the neuroscience community to adopt a culture of data sharing and open access to benefit from them. In this article, we examine the rationale for data sharing among advocates and briefly exemplify these in terms of new "open neuroscience" projects. Then, drawing on the frequently invoked model of data sharing in genomics, we go on to demonstrate the complexities of data sharing, shedding light on the sociological and ethical challenges within the realms of institutions, researchers and participants, namely dilemmas around public/private interests in data, (lack of) motivation to share in the academic community, and potential loss of participant anonymity. Our paper serves to highlight some foreseeable tensions around data sharing relevant to the emergent "open neuroscience" movement.

Results: Independently of hematopoietic lineages, loss of Ostm1 results in acute neurodegeneration with enhanced autophagy. Conclusion: We present evidence for an Ostm1 cell-autonomous role in neurons. Significance: This study shows a novel molecular pathogenic mechanism for neurodegeneration-related diseases. Loss of Ostm1 leads to the most severe form of osteopetrosis in mice and humans. Because functional rescue of the osteopetrotic defect in these mice extended their lifespan from approximate to 3 weeks to 6 weeks, this unraveled a second essential role of Ostm1. We discovered that Ostm1 is highly expressed in the mouse brain in neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. At 3-4 weeks of age, mice with Ostm1 loss showed 3-10-fold stimulation of reactive gliosis, with an increased astrocyte cell population and microglia activation. This inflammatory response was associated with marked retinal photoreceptor degeneration and massive neuronal loss in the brain. Intracellular characterization of neurons revealed abnormal storage of carbohydrates, lipids, and ubiquitinated proteins, combined with marked accumulation of autophagosomes that causes frequent axonal swelling. Stimulation of autophagy was provided by specific markers and by significant down-regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, identifying a cellular pathologic mechanism. A series of transgenic mouse lines specifically targeted to distinct central nervous system cell subpopulations determined that Ostm1 has a primary and autonomous role in neuronal homeostasis. Complete functional complementation demonstrated that the development of severe and rapid neurodegeneration in these mice is independent of the hematopoietic lineage and has clinical implications for treatment of osteopetrosis. Importantly, this study establishes a novel neurodegenerative mouse model critical for understanding the multistep pathogenic cascade of cellular autophagy disorders toward therapeutic strategy design.

DOPAMINE DOWN-REGULATION OF PROTEIN L-ISOASPARTYL METHYLTRANSFERASE IS DEPENDENT ON REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES IN SH-SY5Y CELLS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase; PCMT1; PIMT; dopamine; oxidative stress; Parkinson's disease	HUMAN NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; CARBOXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE; RAT-BRAIN; MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION; INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY; O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; CELLULAR-MODEL	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Dopamine, via the oxidative stress that it generates in the cytosol, could contribute to the selective loss of neurons observed in PD. Protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is an enzyme that repairs L-isoaspartyl-containing proteins and possesses anti-apoptotic properties. PIMT expression has been shown to decrease with age. Together, these observations prompted us to investigate whether dopamine can regulate PIMT expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Here, we report that dopamine down-regulated PIMT at both gene and protein levels. The same inhibition of PIMT protein level was caused by the electron transport chain inhibitor, rotenone, which was accompanied, in both cases, by an increase in cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In fact, pre-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine blocked PIMT dopamine-associated down-regulation. PCMT1 promoter mapping experiments allowed the identification of two regions that showed different sensitivity to DA action. A first region localized between 61 and 94 bp upstream of transcription start site was very sensitive to dopamine inhibition while a second region between 41 and 61 bp appeared more resistant to dopamine inhibitory effect. The inhibition of PCMT1 promoter activity was mediated by dopamine-induced ROS since it was prevented by the hydroxyl radical scavenger N, N'-dimethylthiourea. Conversely, H2O2 inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the transcriptional activity of PCMT1 promoter. Therefore, our findings identified new molecular mechanisms, cytosolic dopamine and its resulting ROS, as inhibitors of PIMT expression. This suggests that ROS generated from cytosolic dopamine could reduce both the PCMT1 gene promoter activity and the PIMT protein level thus decreasing its capacity to repair proteins involved in apoptosis and could contribute to neuronal cell death observed in PD.

J	Allard, R; Faubert, J				Allard, Remy; Faubert, Jocelyn			Motion processing: the most sensitive detectors differ in temporally localized and extended noise	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						local noise; extended noise; motion; detection; discrimination	DISCRIMINATION	Contrast thresholds for discriminating orientation and direction of a drifting, oriented grating are usually similar to contrast detection thresholds, which suggest that the most sensitive detectors are labeled for both orientation and direction (Watson and Robson, 1981). This was found to be true in noiseless condition, but Arena et al. (2013) recently found that this was not true in localized noise (i.e., noise having the same spatiotemporal window as the target) as thresholds for discriminating direction were higher than for discriminating orientation. They suggested that this could be explained by the fact that there are more neurons selective to orientation than direction. Another possible interpretation is that, unlike contrast thresholds in absence of noise, the most sensitive detectors in localized noise were labeled for orientation, but not for direction. This hypothesis is supported by recent findings showing different processes operating in localized and extended noise (i.e., full-screen, continuously displayed noise, Allard and Cavanagh, 2011). In the current study, we evaluated contrast thresholds for orientation and direction discrimination tasks in noiseless conditions, and in noise that was either spatially localized or extended, and temporally localized or extended. We found similar orientation and direction thresholds in absence of noise and in temporally extended noise, but greater direction thresholds in temporally localized noise. This suggests that in noiseless and temporally extended noise the most sensitive detectors were labeled for both orientation and direction (e.g., direction-selective complex cells), whereas in temporally localized noise the most sensitive detectors were labeled for orientation but not direction (e.g., simple cells). We conclude that to avoid violating the noise-invariant processing assumption, external noise paradigms investigating motion processing should use noise that is temporally extended, not localized.

Results: We reviewed 99 controlled studies in total (though nine did not have a control condition). We found that drill and practice training is used more often to retrain neurocognitive deficits while drill and strategy training is used more frequently in the context of sociocognitive remediation. Conclusions: Hypotheses are suggested to better understand those results and future research is recommended to compare drill and strategy with drill and practice training for both social and neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

However, whether multimodal integration in these regions is attributable to interleaved populations of unisensory neurons responding to face or voice or rather by multimodal neurons receiving input from the two modalities is not fully clear. Here, we examine this question using functional magnetic resonance adaptation and dynamic audiovisual stimuli in which emotional information was manipulated parametrically and independently in the face and voice via morphing between angry and happy expressions. Healthy human adult subjects were scanned while performing a happy/angry emotion categorization task on a series of such stimuli included in a fast event-related, continuous carryover design. Subjects integrated both face and voice information when categorizing emotion-although there was a greater weighting of face information-and showed behavioral adaptation effects both within and across modality. Adaptation also occurred at the neural level: in addition to modality-specific adaptation in visual and auditory cortices, we observed for the first time a crossmodal adaptation effect. Specifically, fMRI signal in the right pSTS was reduced in response to a stimulus in which facial emotion was similar to the vocal emotion of the preceding stimulus. These results suggest that the integration of emotional information from face and voice in the pSTS involves a detectable proportion of bimodal neurons that combine inputs from visual and auditory cortices.

Rapid Amygdala Responses during Trace Fear Conditioning without Awareness	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POTENTIALLY PHOBIC STIMULI; OSCILLATORY GAMMA-ACTIVITY; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EMOTIONAL FACES; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; OBJECT REPRESENTATION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; NEURAL ACTIVITY; SINGLE NEURONS; HUMAN BRAIN	The role of consciousness in learning has been debated for nearly 50 years. Recent studies suggest that conscious awareness is needed to bridge the gap when learning about two events that are separated in time, as is true for trace fear conditioning. This has been repeatedly shown and seems to apply to other forms of classical conditioning as well. In contrast to these findings, we show that individuals can learn to associate a face with the later occurrence of a shock, even if they are unable to perceive the face. We used a novel application of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to non-invasively record neural activity from the amygdala, which is known to be important for fear learning. We demonstrate rapid (similar to 170-200 ms) amygdala responses during the stimulus free period between the face and the shock. These results suggest that unperceived faces can serve as signals for impending threat, and that rapid, automatic activation of the amygdala contributes to this process. In addition, we describe a methodology that can be applied in the future to study neural activity with MEG in other subcortical structures.

J	Wade, L; Forlini, C; Racine, E				Wade, Lucie; Forlini, Cynthia; Racine, Eric			Generating genius: how an Alzheimer's drug became considered a 'cognitive enhancer' for healthy individuals	BMC MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							FLIGHT SIMULATOR PERFORMANCE; NEUROCOGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT; COSMETIC NEUROLOGY; NEUROENHANCEMENTS GUIDANCE; HUMANITIES COMMITTEE; COMPLEX SKILLS; NONMEDICAL USE; ADULT PATIENTS; ETHICS; METHYLPHENIDATE	Background: Donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, has been widely cited in media and bioethics literature on cognitive enhancement (CE) as having the potential to improve the cognitive ability of healthy individuals. In both literatures, this claim has been repeatedly supported by the results of a small study published by Yesavage et al. in 2002 on non-demented pilots (30-70 years old). The factors contributing to this specific interpretation of this study's results are unclear. Methods: We examined print media and interdisciplinary bioethics coverage of this small study, aiming to provide insight into how evidence from research may be shaped within different discourses, potentially influencing important policy, ethics, and clinical decisions. Systematic qualitative content analysis was used to examine how this study was reported in 27 media and 22 bioethics articles. Articles were analyzed for content related to: (1) headlines and titles; (2) colloquialisms; and, (3) accuracy of reporting of the characteristics and results of the study. Results: In media and bioethics articles referencing this small study, strong claims were made about donepezil as a CE drug. The majority of headlines, titles, and colloquialisms used enhancement language and the majority of these suggest that donepezil could be used to enhance intellectual ability. Further, both literatures moved between reporting the results of the primary study and magnifying the perceived connection between these results and the CE debate that was alluded to in the primary study. Specific descriptions of the results overwhelmingly reported an improvement in performance on a flight simulator, while more general statements claimed donepezil enhanced cognitive performance. Further, a high level of reporting accuracy was found regarding study characteristics of the original study, but variable levels of accuracy surrounded the presentation of complex characteristics (i.e., methods) or contentious properties of the CE debate (i.e., initial health status of the study subjects). Conclusions: Hyped claims of CE effects cannot be completely accounted for by sheer inaccuracy in reporting. A complex interaction between the primary and secondary literature, and expectations and social pressures related to CE appears to drive enthusiastic reports.

David			The Netrin-1 receptor DCC is a regulator of maladaptive responses to chronic morphine administration	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Genetics; Mapping; Opioid; Pain; Addiction	OPIOID-INDUCED HYPERALGESIA; PHYSICAL-DEPENDENCE; AXON GUIDANCE; ANTINOCICEPTIVE TOLERANCE; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; CHRONIC PAIN; ADULT BRAIN; MOUSE; MICE; NEURONS	Background: Opioids are the cornerstone of treatment for moderate to severe pain, but chronic use leads to maladaptations that include: tolerance, dependence and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). These responses limit the utility of opioids, as well as our ability to control chronic pain. Despite decades of research, we have no therapies or proven strategies to overcome this problem. However, murine haplotype based computational genetic mapping and a SNP data base generated from analysis of whole-genome sequence data (whole-genome HBCGM), provides a hypothesis-free method for discovering novel genes affecting opioid maladaptive responses. Results: Whole genome-HBCGM was used to analyze phenotypic data on morphine-induced tolerance, dependence and hyperalgesia obtained from 23 inbred strains. The robustness of the genetic mapping results was analyzed using strain subsets. In addition, the results of analyzing all of the opioid-related traits together were examined. To characterize the functional role of the leading candidate gene, we analyzed transgenic animals, mRNA and protein expression in behaviorally divergent mouse strains, and immunohistochemistry in spinal cord tissue. Our mapping procedure identified the allelic pattern within the netrin-1 receptor gene (Dcc) as most robustly associated with OIH, and it was also strongly associated with the combination of the other maladaptive opioid traits analyzed. Adult mice heterozygous for the Dcc gene had significantly less tendency to develop OIH, become tolerant or show evidence of dependence after chronic exposure to morphine. The difference in opiate responses was shown not to be due to basal or morphine-stimulated differences in the level of Dcc expression in spinal cord tissue, and was not associated with nociceptive neurochemical or anatomical alterations in the spinal cord or dorsal root ganglia in adult animals. Conclusions: Whole-genome HBCGM is a powerful tool for identifying genes affecting biomedical traits such as opioid maladaptations. We demonstrate that Dcc affects tolerance, dependence and OIH after chronic opioid exposure, though not through simple differences in expression in the adult spinal cord.

Hence, we investigated whether the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters -Al and -G1, known to regulate cellular cholesterol efflux and lipidation of the apolipoprotein E-containing lipoprotein complex are actively involved in this context of brain's plastic response to neurodegeneration and deafferentation. We assessed ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA and protein levels throughout the degenerative phase and the reinnervation process and evaluated the associated cholinergic sprouting following ECL in the adult mouse brain. We subsequently tested the effect of the pharmacological activation of the nuclear receptor LXR, prior to versus after ECL, on hippocampal ABCA1 and G1 expression and on reinnervation. ECL induced a timedependent up-regulation of ABCA1, but not G1, that coincided with a significant increase in acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Pre-ECL, but not post-ECL i.p. treatment with the LXR agonist TO901317 also led to a significant increase solely in hippocampal ABCA1 expression, paralleled by increases in both AchE and synaptophysin protein levels in the deafferented hippocampus. Thus, ABCA1 and -G1 are differentially regulated in the lesioned brain and upon treatment with an LXR agonist. Further, TO901317-induced up-regulation of ABCA1 appears to be more beneficial in a prevention (pre-lesion) than rescue (post-lesion) treatment; both findings support a central role for ABC transporters in brain plasticity.(c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Mutations that affect DG function not only result in muscular dystrophies, but also in severe cognitive deficits and epilepsy. Here we demonstrate a role of DG during activity-dependent homeostatic regulation of hippocampal inhibitory synapses. Prolonged elevation of neuronal activity up-regulates DG expression and glycosylation, and its localization to inhibitory synapses. Inhibition of protein synthesis prevents the activity-dependent increase in synaptic DG and GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs), as well as the homeostatic scaling up of GABAergic synaptic transmission. RNAi-mediated knockdown of DG blocks homeostatic scaling up of inhibitory synaptic strength, as does knockdown of like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE)-a glycosyltransferase critical for DG function. In contrast, DG is not required for the bicuculline-induced scaling down of excitatory synaptic strength or the tetrodotoxin-induced scaling down of inhibitory synaptic strength. The DG ligand agrin increases GABAergic synaptic strength in a DG-dependent manner that mimics homeostatic scaling up induced by increased activity, indicating that activation of this pathway alone is sufficient to regulate GABA(A)R trafficking. These data demonstrate that DG is regulated in a physiologically relevant manner in neurons and that DG and its glycosylation are essential for homeostatic plasticity at inhibitory synapses.

A total of 115 community-dwelling, healthy adults between the ages of 45 and 87 completed the Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (QAM) and were tested with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. A principal component analysis identified seven dimensions of complaint. Difficulty inhibiting internal and external sources of interference when learning or remembering something was the main area of complaint and it was correlated with word-list recall and Digit Symbol. We identified complaints related to a set of memory failures that appear to be more detrimental to autonomy and safety. These were correlated with a measure of functional autonomy and might, therefore, indicate more severe difficulties. Overall, this study provides indications regarding the main domains of memory complaints and identifies which complaints are most reflective of objective cognitive problems.

Loss of person-specific knowledge in Alzheimer's disease: Evidence from priming	NEUROCASE			English	Article						Aging; Cognition; Dementia; Executive function; Famous people; Neuropsychological tests	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SEMANTIC MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; DEMENTIA; DEFICITS	Semantic deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often more severe for items that are characterized by a unique semantic and lexical association, such as famous people. Whether these deficits are due to the degradation of semantic information or a deficit in the ability to intentionally access semantic knowledge remains controversial. To assess the integrity of the semantic system without explicitly accessing it, a priming paradigm was used. Semantic and repetition priming effects in individuals with AD (n = 7) and age-matched controls (n = 13) were measured in a familiarity judgment task using visually-presented names of famous people. A defective priming effect in AD subjects was observed in the semantic priming but not in the repetition priming condition. Therefore, the semantic impairments observed in AD may indicate a degraded representation of the semantic information concerning famous people.

The causes and consequences of tau hyperphosphorylation are routinely investigated in laboratory animals. Mice are the models of choice as they are easily amenable to transgenic technology; consequently, their tau phosphorylation levels are frequently monitored by Western blotting using a panel of monoclonal/polyclonal anti-tau antibodies. Given that mouse secondary antibodies can recognize endogenous mouse immunoglobulins (Igs) and the possible lack of specificity with some polyclonal antibodies, non-specific signals are commonly observed. Here, we characterized the profiles of commonly used anti-tau antibodies in four different mouse models: non-transgenic mice, tau knock-out (TKO) mice, 3xTg-AD mice, and hypothermic mice, the latter a positive control for tau hyperphosphorylation. We identified 3 tau monoclonal antibody categories: type 1, characterized by high non-specificity (AT8, AT180, MC1, MC6, TG-3), type 2, demonstrating low non-specificity (AT270, CP13, CP27, Tau12, TG5), and type 3, with no non-specific signal (DA9, PHF-1, Tau1, Tau46). For polyclonal anti-tau antibodies, some displayed non-specificity (pS262, pS409) while others did not (pS199, pT205, pS396, pS404, pS422, A0024). With monoclonal antibodies, most of the interfering signal was due to endogenous Igs and could be eliminated by different techniques: i) using secondary antibodies designed to bind only non-denatured Igs, ii) preparation of a heat-stable fraction, iii) clearing Igs from the homogenates, and iv) using secondary antibodies that only bind the light chain of Igs. All of these techniques removed the non-specific signal; however, the first and the last methods were easier and more reliable. Overall, our study demonstrates a high risk of artefactual signal when performing Western blotting with routinely used anti-tau antibodies, and proposes several solutions to avoid non-specific results. We strongly recommend the use of negative (i. e., TKO) and positive (i. e., hypothermic) controls in all experiments.

Decompressive Craniectomy: Contra lateral Lesions and Metabolic Abnormalities	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ACUTE SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; INTRACRANIAL-PRESSURE; HEAD TRAUMA; COAGULOPATHY; COMPLICATIONS; HYPOTHERMIA; EVACUATION; SECONDARY; ACIDOSIS	Objective: To define the incidence of new contralateral intracranial lesions following decompressive hemicraniectomy for blunt traumatic brain injury, and explore the potential association with metabolic factors that contribute to coagulopathy. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records and imaging of all patients treated with hemicraniectomy for blunt traumatic brain injury at our institution from May 2007 up to and including January 2012. Results: Twenty patients were identified during the time period to have undergone decompressive craniectomy for blunt head injury. The average age and Glasgow Coma Scale on presentation was 44.1 years (range: 19 72 years) and 6.5 (range: 3 - 14) respectively. All but one patient presented with an extra-axial hematoma as their surgical indication for craniectomy. Seven patients (35.0%) developed new contralateral lesions post-craniectomy. The average pen-operative pH, bicarbonate (HCO3) and hematocrit (HCT) levels for those with new contralateral lesions were lower than those without new lesions. Five of the seven patients (71.4%) with new lesions had abnormalities on their laboratory results that have been know to be attributable to coagulopathy, with four (57.1%) having two or more abnormal results. Eight of 13 (61.5%) patients without new lesion had laboratory abnormalites, with five (38.5%) having two or more abnormalities identified. Conclusions: The incidence of new contralateral lesions post-craniectomy for blunt head injury is 35.0% in our experience. There is an association between the metabolic derangements linked to trauma related coagulopathy and the formation of new lesions.	[Zeiler, F.

However, some device modifications may carry additional risks, not immediately apparent to operators. A patient with a symptomatic, partially thrombosed basilar apex aneurysm was allocated balloon-assisted coiling. Attempts were made to place a microwire across the basilar apex through the posterior communicating artery. Overlapping courses of the posterior cerebral and posterior choroidal arteries on the roadmap images were not recognized and a flanged-tip microwire was inadvertently advanced deep into the choroidal artery. Following the wire with a microcatheter led to binding of arterial tissue within the microcatheter. Removing the wire led to an avulsion of the choroidal artery and a severe hemorrhagic complication which proved fatal. Tissue was identified on the tip of the guidewire. Pathology showed layers of vascular tissue within the laser-cut flanges of the distal wire tip. A similar complication, also fatal, occurred during balloon angioplasty of a distal vertebral artery, when an exchange wire was accidently introduced into a perforator from a posterior cerebral artery. Ex vivo catheterization of distal mesenteric arterial branches showed that the wall of small arteries can be entrapped by laser-cut, flanged, but not by smooth guidewire tips. Microwires with a flanged instead of smooth distal tip, when placed into small caliber vessels, may cause hemorrhagic complications from avulsions*.

This study examines how telerehabilitation becomes part of existing and new clinical routines and identifies factors that enable or constrain its routine use. Methods. An in-depth case study of a telemedicine program in rehabilitation implemented between an urban specialized rehabilitation center and a rural regional rehabilitation center was conducted. Using a conceptual framework based on Giddens' theory of structuration, a qualitative analysis was carried out using four data sources: focus groups and phone interviews (with health professionals, managers, and patients and their family members); telerehabilitation video recordings; and project documents (e.g., proposals, requests for funding, summaries, agendas of meetings, operating procedures, patient handouts, and tools for clinicians). Results. In two rehabilitation programs for 1) patients who sustained a traumatic brain injury and 2) those who sustained a spinal cord injury, telerehabilitation was successfully incorporated into routine clinical practices for activities such as interdisciplinary care plans. However, for specialized clinical consultations or long-term patient follow-up, telerehabilitation was not successfully incorporated. Factors that facilitated or prevented the integration of telerehabilitation in routine practices stemmed from both the structure (norms, rules, resources, and values) and the agent (e.g., users of telerehabilitation, including clinicians, managers, and patients and their families) and include 1) shared beliefs and assumptions held by patient care team members regarding the nature of the clinical activities, and the perceptions of patients and their family members; 2) clinical and organizational leadership; 3) extent and type of telerehabilitation use; 4) available resources; and 5) collaborations already in place or needing to be developed. Conclusions. This study provides empirical evidence of how telerehabilitation activities may become integrated into routine day-to-day clinical activities.

To verify whether long-term retention of a motor skill is also modulated by the presence of the polymorphism, 20 participants (10 Val66Val, 10 Val66Met) were tested twice at a 1-wk interval. During each visit, excitability of the motor cortex was measured by transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) before and after performance of a procedural motor learning task (serial reaction time task) designed to study sequence-specific learning of the right hand and sequence-specific transfer from the right to the left hand. Behavioral results showed a motor learning effect that persisted for at least a week and task-related increases in corticospinal excitability identical for both sessions and without distinction for genetic group. Sequence-specific transfer of the motor skill from the right hand to the left hand was greater in session 2 than in session 1 only in the Val66Met genetic group. Further analysis revealed that the sequence-specific transfer occurred equally at both sessions in the Val66Val genotype group. In the Val66Met genotype group, sequence-specific transfer did not occur at session 1 but did at session 2. These data suggest a limited impact of Val66Met polymorphism on the learning and retention of a complex motor skill and its associated changes in corticospinal excitability over time, and a possible modulation of the interhemispheric transfer of procedural learning.

Knowing whether rodent models of neuropathic pain produce persistent pain is therefore crucial to their translational applicability. We investigated the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain and the formalin pain model in rats using positron emission tomography (PET) with the metabolic tracer [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to determine if there is ongoing brain activity suggestive of persistent pain. For the formalin model, under brief anesthesia we injected one hindpaw with 5% formalin and the FDG tracer into a tail vein. We then allowed the animals to awaken and observed pain behavior for 30 min during the FDG uptake period. The rat was then anesthetized and placed in the scanner for static image acquisition, which took place between minutes 45 and 75 post-tracer injection. A single reference rat brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) was used to align the PET images with the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas. Increased glucose metabolism was observed in the somatosensory region associated with the injection site (S1 hindlimb contralateral), Si jaw/upper lip and cingulate cortex. Decreases were observed in the prelimbic cortex and hippocampus. Second, SNI rats were scanned 3 weeks post-surgery using the same scanning paradigm, and region-of-interest analyses revealed increased metabolic activity in the contralateral 51 hindlimb. Finally, a second cohort of SNI rats was scanned while anesthetized during the tracer uptake period, and the Si hindlimb increase was not observed. Increased brain activity in the somatosensory cortex of SNI rats resembled the activity produced with the injection of formalin, suggesting that the SNI model may produce persistent pain. The lack of increased activity in Si hindlimb with general anesthetic demonstrates that this effect can be blocked, as well as highlights the importance of investigating brain activity in awake and behaving rodents.

CUAJ-CANADIAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL			English	Review							ARTIFICIAL URINARY SPHINCTER; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; STRESS-INCONTINENCE; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; CANCER OUTCOMES; CONTINENCE; MEN; IMPLANTATION; DULOXETINE; PRESSURE	Introduction: With the increasing number of radical prostatectomies (RP) performed, male stress urinary incontinence (SUI) has become common. The artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) is the gold standard to treat SUI post-RP, but new devices have recently been developed. We review the recent studies on the treatment of SUI post-RP; we also describe the surgical techniques, mechanisms of action and results of these new procedures. Methods: We conducted a literature review search in the PubMed/Medline and Embase databases. Our search was restricted to recent articles. We included studies even if the urinary incontinence was due to sphincter deficiency after RP in non-neurologic patients. Results: We found 8 cohort studies for the surgical procedure: 3 studies concerning slings, 1 involving balloons adjustable implant, and 4 involving new devices. The only randomized controlled trial (RCT) was a pharmacologic clinical trial comparing duloxetine to placebo. The social continence rates were analyzed for 6 studies and were up to 66%. Conclusion: New minimally invasive surgical procedures have emerged as the main alternative to AUS, with social continence rates up to 60% despite just 1 RCT studying the pharmacologic approach. There is an urgent need for well-designed clinical trials to clarify the role of new surgical alternatives in the management of SUI post-RP. New technologies should continue to be evaluated and compared with the AUS, which remains the gold standard.

Composition of the committee Experts and delegates representing relevant disciplines from diverse regions across Canada discussed and agreed upon revisions to the 2006 guidelines. Methods The GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) system was used to evaluate consensus on recommendations, which was defined as when 80% or more of participants voted for the recommendation. Evidence grades are reported where possible. Report Important for FPs, despite advances in liquid biomarkers and neuroimaging, the diagnosis of dementia in Canada remains fundamentally clinical. New core clinical criteria for the diagnosis of AD now recognize less common, nonamnestic forms. Early-onset dementia, a rare but important condition, should prompt referral to specialists with access to genetic counselors. Rapidly progressive dementia, poorly defined in the literature, is described to facilitate detection of this rare but important condition. There are new expanded indications for cholinesterase inhibitors beyond AD, as well as guidelines for their discontinuation, which had not been previously described. New evidence regarding use of memantine, antidepressants, and other psychotropic medications in dementia care is presented. Conclusion Several recommendations from the Fourth Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia are relevant to FPs.

IBIS Network	Network inefficiencies in autism spectrum disorder at 24 months	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; FUSIFORM FACE AREA; CHILDHOOD AUTISM; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; TEMPORAL-LOBE; WHITE-MATTER; SMALL-WORLD; FRONTAL-CORTEX; BRAIN NETWORK	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder defined by behavioral symptoms that emerge during the first years of life. Associated with these symptoms are differences in the structure of a wide array of brain regions, and in the connectivity between these regions. However, the use of cohorts with large age variability and participants past the generally recognized age of onset of the defining behaviors means that many of the reported abnormalities may be a result of cascade effects of developmentally earlier deviations. This study assessed differences in connectivity in ASD at the age at which the defining behaviors first become clear. There were 113 24-month-old participants at high risk for ASD, 31 of whom were classified as ASD, and 23 typically developing 24-month-old participants at low risk for ASD. Utilizing diffusion data to obtain measures of the length and strength of connections between anatomical regions, we performed an analysis of network efficiency. Our results showed significantly decreased local and global efficiency over temporal, parietal and occipital lobes in high-risk infants classified as ASD, relative to both low-and high-risk infants not classified as ASD. The frontal lobes showed only a reduction in global efficiency in Broca's area. In addition, these same regions showed an inverse relation between efficiency and symptom severity across the high-risk infants. The results suggest delay or deficits in infants with ASD in the optimization of both local and global aspects of network structure in regions involved in processing auditory and visual stimuli, language and nonlinguistic social stimuli.

ELEGANS; LONGEVITY; GENE; DISEASE; SIGNALS; PROTEIN; FOOD	Glucose is a major energy source and is a key regulator of metabolism but excessive dietary glucose is linked to several disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity and cardiac dysfunction. Dietary intake greatly influences organismal survival but whether the effects of nutritional status are transmitted to the offspring is an unresolved question. Here we show that exposing Caenorhabditis elegans to high glucose concentrations in the parental generation leads to opposing negative effects on fecundity, while having protective effects against cellular stress in the descendent progeny. The transgenerational inheritance of glucose-mediated phenotypes is dependent on the insulin/IGF-like signalling pathway and components of the histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylase complex are essential for transmission of inherited phenotypes. Thus dietary over-consumption phenotypes are heritable with profound effects on the health and survival of descendants.	[Tauffenberger, Arnaud; Parker, J.

J	Ladyman, SR; Woodside, B				Ladyman, Sharon R.; Woodside, Barbara			Food restriction during lactation suppresses Kiss1 mRNA expression and kisspeptin-stimulated LH release in rats	REPRODUCTION			English	Article							ARCUATE NUCLEUS; HORMONE NEURONS; MILK DELIVERY; FEMALE RAT; SECRETION; ESTROGEN; ACTIVATION; RESPONSIVENESS; PROJECTIONS; INFERTILITY	Among the numerous physiological changes that accompany lactation is the suppression of the reproductive axis. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible role for the kisspeptin system in the restoration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis during late lactation in rats using a food restriction model that allows manipulation of the duration of lactational anovulation. Kiss1 mRNA expression and kisspeptin-immunoreactive cell counts were examined in both food-restricted dams and ad libitum (AL)-fed dams across late lactation when LH concentrations begin to increase. In the arcuate nucleus, Kiss1 mRNA expression and kisspeptin-positive cell counts were suppressed during late lactation. In the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV), day 15 food-restricted dams had significantly lower AVPV Kiss1 mRNA expression and a decreased LH response to exogenous kisspeptin compared with the AL-fed dams. Following 5 days of ad libitum food intake, these values were restored to levels similar to those in dams that had been fed ad libitum throughout lactation. In conclusion, this study shows that delayed restoration of the reproductive axis due to food restriction is associated with a decrease in kisspeptin sensitivity and low AVPV Kiss1 mRNA in late lactation.

We aimed to explore the maternal and child factors associated with histologic chorioamnionitis in cerebral palsy. Methods: We conducted an observational study on a cohort of children with cerebral palsy who were identified from the Quebec Cerebral Palsy Registry. Placental pathology was reported prospectively. Maternal and child factors associated with histological chorioamnionitis were explored. Results: Placental reports were available in 455 of 534 (85%) children with cerebral palsy, and of these 12% had histological signs of chorioamnionitis on reports. These children were more likely to have large placentas over 90th percentile for gestational age (53.7% versus 30.7%, p = 0.001) and were born significantly more prematurely (<32 weeks in 51.9% vs 24.1%, p = 0.007) than children without chorioamnionitis. A clinical sign of perinatal infection was reported in 61.1% of children with chorioamnionitis, however each clinical sign was seen in a minority of these children. Children with chorioamnionitis were more likely to have spastic diplegic cerebral palsy subtype (37% vs 19.2%, p = 0.003) and periventricular white matter injury on neuroimaging (52.9% vs 35.8%, p = 0.004). However no differences in neuroimaging or subtypes were seen when stratified by prematurity. Discussion: Histological chorioamnionitis was a frequent pathological finding in children with cerebral palsy born prematurely, with larger placentas relative to gestation and birth weight. Future case control studies are needed to shed light on the role of inflammatory placental findings in pregnancy outcomes. (C) 2014 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ENZYME-REPLACEMENT THERAPY; CRYPTOGENIC ISCHEMIC-STROKE; YOUNG-PATIENTS; CEREBROVASCULAR-DISEASE; HEMODIALYSIS-PATIENTS; AGALSIDASE-BETA; STORAGE; COHORT; CARDIOMYOPATHY; ASSOCIATION	Background: Fabry disease is an uncommon but treatable cause of stroke. Enzyme replacement therapy helps improve neurologic symptoms. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of Fabry disease in stroke patients. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for relevant articles published in English up to February 2013. Studies that reported incidence or prevalence of Fabry disease in stroke patients were included. Two reviewers independently assessed studies to determine eligibility, validity, and quality. Meta-analysis was performed to calculate the prevalence of Fabry disease by etiology and gender. Results: Nine studies (n = 8302 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Eight studies (n = 8148) examined the prevalence of Fabry disease in young stroke patients. Overall qualities of included studies were moderate to high. The prevalence of Fabry disease ranged from .4% to 2.6% on strokes of any etiologies. In cryptogenic stroke, the prevalence ranged from .6% to 11.1%, 4.5% in men (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.2%-6.3%) and 3.4% in women (95% CI = 1.0%-10.7%). The prevalence of Fabry disease in patients with all etiologies was similar in men (.9% [95% CI = .3%-2.3%]) and (1.4% [95% CI = .7%-2.7%]) in women. Conclusions: Fabry disease may explain approximately 1% of all strokes in the young, including 3%-5% of cryptogenic strokes. The confirmation of Fabry disease may be challenging as there are different criteria for men and women. Early recognition of Fabry disease may help initiate the appropriate treatment to decrease the risk of subsequent complications.

Eye Movements as a Probe of Corollary Discharge Function in Schizophrenia	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Editorial Material						Schizophrenia; Saccades; Vision; Corollary Discharge; Neurons		Nearly every movement made by every animal is accompanied by a corollary discharge, a signal sent from the motor to sensory regions of its brain. Corollary discharges are a crucial mechanism by which the brain monitors its own actions, and there is some evidence that they are impaired in people with schizophrenia. Here, I briefly review this evidence and suggest that eye movements are a particularly valuable tool for assessing the role of corollary discharges in schizophrenia.

The aims of this study were: first, to examine the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety-depression in caregivers of children with neurological diseases requiring HEN by gastrostomy tube (GT); second, to compare the characteristics of caregivers with high or low risk of exhibiting symptoms of anxiety-depression; and third, to investigate possible associations to child disease severity and nutrition support mode. MethodsA cross-sectional observational study was performed in 58 caregivers of children (31 boys, aged 0.3-18 years) with neurological diseases and GT feeding. The characteristics of caregivers with high or low risk of presenting symptoms of anxiety-depression were compared regarding the following variables: socio-demographic characteristics, the primary caregiver's intrapsychic factors, anthropometric parameters of the child, length of HEN, type of nutrients delivered by GT and infusion regime. ResultsAll primary caregivers were mothers. Fifty-three per cent of them showed high risk of exhibiting symptoms of anxiety-depression. Mothers with high or low risk of presenting symptoms of anxiety-depression were comparable in age and family socio-economic status. They were also similar in terms of age, anthropometric conditions and length of HEN in their children.No differences were found between the two groups of mothers according to the level of the child's motor function impairment, type of nutrients delivered by GT and infusion regime. Higher levels of psychological distress and perception of burden overload were found in mothers with high risk of exhibiting symptoms of anxiety-depression. ConclusionsThis study found a high prevalence of symptoms of anxiety-depression, perception of burden overload and psychological distress in caregivers of children with HEN. Thus, greater practical and emotional support is required for these families.

A 53-year-old man experienced multiple brief vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and strokes, not apparently triggered by neck movements. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented consecutive infarcts, first in the left then right medial posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territories. Angiography showed two extracranial right vertebral artery (VA) stenoses, left VA hypoplasia, absence of left PICA and a dominant right PICA. Computed tomography angiography revealed right VA compression by osteophytes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 levels. No further vertebrobasilar insufficiency symptoms occurred in the 65 months following VA surgical decompression. Our literature review found 49 published surgical cases with vertebrobasilar symptoms caused by cervical spondylosis. Forty cases had one or more brief TIAs frequently triggered by neck movements. Three cases presented with stroke without prior TIA, with symptoms suggesting a top of the basilar artery embolic infarcts (one combined with a PICA infarct). Six cases had both TIAs and minor stroke. VA compression by uncovertebral osteophytes at the C5-C6 level was common. Dynamic angiography done in 38 cases systematically revealed worsening of VA stenosis or complete occlusion with either neck extension or rotation (ipsilateral when specified). Contralateral VA incompetence was found in 14 patients. Spondylotic VA stenosis can cause hemodynamic TIAs and watershed strokes, especially when contralateral VA insufficiency is combined to specific neck movements. Low-amplitude neck movement may suffice in severe cases. Embolic vertebrobasilar events are less frequent. VA decompression from spondylosis may prevent recurrent ischemic episodes.

J	Dubrovsky, AS; Friedman, D; Kocilowicz, H				Dubrovsky, Alexander Sasha; Friedman, Debbie; Kocilowicz, Helen			Pediatric Post-Traumatic Headaches and Peripheral Nerve Blocks of the Scalp: A Case Series and Patient Satisfaction Survey	HEADACHE			English	Article						post-concussion syndrome; post-traumatic headache; nerve block	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; GREATER OCCIPITAL NERVE; POSTCONCUSSION SYNDROME; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; SUBOCCIPITAL REGION; DOUBLE-BLIND; CHILDREN; SYMPTOMS; MIGRAINE; CONCUSSION	Objective This study's objective is to characterize the therapeutic effect of peripheral nerve blocks of the scalp for children and adolescents with post-traumatic headaches. Background Headaches are the most frequently reported persistent symptoms following a pediatric mild traumatic brain injury, may be challenging to treat, and can transform into debilitating chronic headaches. The beneficial use of peripheral nerve blocks of the scalp has been reported for adults with post-traumatic headaches. Methods Retrospective case series on all patients January 2012 and June 2013 in the mild traumatic brain injury clinic with a nerve block. The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a good therapeutic effect, defined by the duration of the block being >24 hours and/or repeat blocks requested. A data extractor blinded to main outcome measures performed the chart review. A patient satisfaction survey was also sent to all patients to assess the recalled experience with the interventions received. Results A total of 62 nerve blocks were performed on 28 patients for 30 injuries that led to post-traumatic headaches. The mean (standard deviation) age was 14.6 (1.7) years. The first nerve blocks were performed a mean (standard deviation) of 70 (54.2) days post-injury. The therapeutic effect was good in 93% of patients with 71% reporting immediate complete relief of their headaches; the mean percent headache reduction was 94%. Most (91%) would recommend a nerve block for post-traumatic headaches. Conclusion The ease with which peripheral nerve blocks of the scalp can be performed combined with the immediate relief experienced by patients makes them a potential addition to the armamentarium of headache management strategies for children and adolescent with post-traumatic headaches.

Results and Conclusions: Increased lung and bladder cancer risks have been reported in Soderberg workers from several countries, but not in all. After adjustment for smoking, these cancer risks still increase with cumulative exposure to benzo(a)pyrene, used as an index of coal tar pitch volatiles exposure. Limited evidence has been gathered in several cohorts for an increased risk of tumors at other sites, including stomach, pancreas, rectum/rectosigmoid junction, larynx, buccal cavity/pharynx, kidney, brain/nervous system, prostate, and lymphatic/hematopoietic tissues (in particular non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, and leukemia). Nevertheless, for most of these tumor sites, the relationship with specific exposures has not been demonstrated clearly and further follow-up of workers is warranted.

Study design Three-dimensional volumetric magnetic resonance imaging was used to calculate tissue-specific brain volumes and a standardized neurobehavioral assessment was performed to assess neurobehavioral status in 35 full-term newborns admitted to the hospital before cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Multiple linear regression models were performed to evaluate relationships between neurobehavioral status and brain volumes. Results Reduced subcortical gray matter (SCGM) volume and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume were associated with poor behavioral state regulation (SCGM, P = .04; CSF, P = .007) and poor visual orienting (CSF, P = .003). In cyanotic newborns, reduced SCGM was associated with higher overall abnormal scores on the assessment (P = .001) and poor behavioral state regulation (P = .04), and increased CSF volume was associated with poor behavioral state regulation (P = .02), and poor visual orienting (P = .02). Conversely, acyanotic newborns showed associations between reduced cerebellar volume and poor behavioral state regulation (P = .03). Conclusion Abnormal neurobehavior is associated with impaired volumetric brain growth before open heart surgery in infants with complex congenital heart defects. This study highlights a need for routine preoperative screening and early intervention to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.

However, due to the short half-life of clinically used isotopes, other long-lived isotopes not used in clinical practice are used to perform the PSF measurements. As such, non-optimal PSF models that do not correspond to those needed for the data to be reconstructed are used within resolution modeling (RM) image reconstruction, usually underestimating the true PSF owing to the difference in positron range. In high resolution brain and preclinical imaging, this effect is of particular importance since the PSFs become more positron range limited and isotope-specific PSFs can help maximize the performance benefit from using resolution recovery image reconstruction algorithms. Methods: In this work, the authors used a printing technique to simultaneously measure multiple point sources on the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT), and the authors demonstrated the feasibility of deriving isotope-dependent system matrices from fluorine-18 and carbon-11 point sources. Furthermore, the authors evaluated the impact of incorporating them within RM image reconstruction, using carbon-11 phantom and clinical datasets on the HRRT. Results: The results obtained using these two isotopes illustrate that even small differences in positron range can result in different PSF maps, leading to further improvements in contrast recovery when used in image reconstruction. The difference is more pronounced in the centre of the field-of-view where the full width at half maximum (FWHM) from the positron range has a larger contribution to the overall FWHM compared to the edge where the parallax error dominates the overall FWHM. Conclusions: Based on the proposed methodology, measured isotope-specific and spatially variant PSFs can be reliably derived and used for improved spatial resolution and variance performance in resolution recovery image reconstruction. The benefits are expected to be more substantial for more energetic positron emitting isotopes such as Oxygen-15 and Rubidium-82. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

A critical role for prefrontocortical endocannabinoid signaling in the regulation of stress and emotional behavior	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Endocannabinoid system; Prefrontal cortex; Stress; Emotional behavior	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; CANNABINOID CB1 RECEPTORS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; CHRONIC MILD STRESS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SITU HYBRIDIZATION HISTOCHEMISTRY; CHRONIC UNPREDICTABLE STRESS; ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITY; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER	The prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides executive control of the brain in humans and rodents, coordinating cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to threatening stimuli and subsequent feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The endocannabinoid system has emerged as a fundamental regulator of HPA axis feedback inhibition and an important modulator of emotional behavior. However, the precise role of endocannabinoid signaling within the PFC with respect to stress coping and emotionality has only recently been investigated. This review discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the localization and function of the endocannabinoid system in the PFC, its sensitivity to stress and its role in modulating the neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. We propose a model whereby steady-state endocannabinoid signaling in the medial PFC indirectly regulates the outflow of pyramidal neurons by fine-tuning GABAergic inhibition: Local activation of this population of CB1 receptors increases the downstream targets of medial PFC activation, which include inhibitory interneurons in the basolateral amygdala, inhibitory relay neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and monoamine cell bodies such as the dorsal raphe nucleus. This ultimately produces beneficial effects on emotionality (active coping responses to stress and reduced anxiety) and assists in constraining activation of the HPA axis. Under conditions of chronic stress, or in individuals suffering from mood disorders, this system may be uniquely recruited to help maintain appropriate function in the face of adversity, while breakdown of the endocannabinoid system in the medial PFC may be, in and of itself, sufficient to produce neuropsychiatric illness. Thus, we suggest that endocannabinoid signaling in the medial PFC may represent an attractive target for the treatment of stress-related disorders. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods After composition of the research group, a Delphi consensus was initiated to identify and rate all features, which may be relevant to assess UIAs and their treatment by using ranking scales and analysis of inter-rater agreement (IRA) for each factor. IRA was categorized as very high, high, moderate, or low. Results Ultimately, 39 specialists from 4 specialties agreed (high or very high IRAs) on the following key factors for or against UIA treatment decisions: (1) patient age, life expectancy, and comorbid diseases; (2) previous subarachnoid hemorrhage from a different aneurysm, family history for UIA or subarachnoid hemorrhage, nicotine use; (3) UIA size, location, and lobulation; (4) UIA growth or de novo formation on serial imaging; (5) clinical symptoms (cranial nerve deficit, mass effect, and thromboembolic events from UIAs); and (6) risk factors for UIA treatment (patient age and life expectancy, UIA size, and estimated risk of treatment). However, IRAs for features rated with low relevance were also generally low, which underlined the existing controversy about the natural history of UIAs. Conclusions Our results highlight that neurovascular specialists currently consider many features as important when evaluating UIAs but also highlight that the appreciation of natural history of UIAs remains uncertain, even within a group of highly informed individuals.

Tactile sensory system: encoding from the periphery to the cortex	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-SYSTEMS BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article							GLABROUS SKIN MECHANORECEPTORS; RANDOM NOISE SEQUENCES; CUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS; PACINIAN CORPUSCLES; PASSIVE TOUCH; HUMAN HAND; MEISSNER CORPUSCLE; MACAQUE MONKEY; PRECISION GRIP; FORCE CONTROL	Specialized mechanoreceptors in the skin respond to mechanical deformation and provide the primary input to the tactile sensory system. Although the morphology of these receptors has been documented, there is still considerable uncertainty as to the relation between cutaneous receptor morphology and the associated physiological responses to stimulation. Labelled-line models of somatosensory processes in which specific mechanoreceptors are associated with particular sensory qualities fail to account for the evidence showing that all types of tactile afferent units respond to a varying extent to most types of natural stimuli. Neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments have provided the framework for determining the relation between peripheral afferent or cortical activity and tactile perception. Neural codes derived from these afferent signals are evaluated in terms of their capacity to predict human perceptual performance. One particular challenge in developing models of the tactile sensory system is the dual use of sensory signals from the skin. In addition to their perceptual function they serve as inputs to the sensorimotor control system involved in manipulation. Perceptions generated through active touch differ from those resulting from passive stimulation of the skin because they are the product of self-generated exploratory processes. Recent research in this area has highlighted the importance of shear forces in these exploratory movements and has shown that fingertip skin is particularly sensitive to shear generated during both object manipulation and tactile exploration.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging Initi	Variants in PPP3R1 and MAPT are associated with more rapid functional decline in Alzheimer's disease: The Cache County Dementia Progression Study	ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Genetics; Association; Rate of progression; PPP3R1; MAPT	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; COGNITIVE DECLINE; IDENTIFIES VARIANTS; COMMON VARIANTS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; REVEALS; LOCI; APOE; CLU; PICALM	Background: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the gene encoding the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2B (PPP3R1, rs1868402) and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, rs3785883) gene were recently associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels in samples from the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University (WU) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In these same samples, these SNPs were also associated with faster functional decline, or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes scores (CDR-sb). We attempted to validate the latter association in an independent, population-based sample of incident AD cases from the Cache County Dementia Progression Study (DPS). Methods: All 92 AD cases from the DPS with a global CDR-sb <= 1 (mild) at initial clinical assessment who were later assessed on CDR-sb data on at least two other time points were genotyped at the two SNPs of interest (rs1868402 and rs3785883). We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between these SNPs and CDR-sb trajectory. All analyses were performed using Proc Mixed in SAS. Results: Although we observed no association between rs3785883 or rs1868402 alone and change in CDR-sb (P >.10), there was a significant association between a combined genotype model and change in CDR-sb: carriers of the high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed >2.9 times faster than noncarriers (P =.015). When data from DPS were combined with previously published data from WU and ADNI, change in CDR-sb was 30% faster for each copy of the high-risk allele at rs3785883 (P =.0082) and carriers of both high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed 6 times faster (P <.0001) than all others combined. Conclusions: We replicate a previous report by Cruchaga et al that specific variations in rs3785883 and rs1868402 are associated with accelerated progression of AD. Further characterization of this association will provide a better understanding of how genetic factors influence the rate of progression of AD and could provide novel insights into preventative and therapeutic strategies.

To address Cu imbalances, we synthesized two different dendritic nanoparticles (NP) for the transport of Cu(II) ions across the blood brain barrier (BBB). The synthesized NPs show low toxicity and high water solubility and can stabilize high amounts of Cu(II). The Cu(II)-laden NPs crossed cellular membranes and increased the cellular Cu level. A human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) model was established to investigate the permeability of the NPs through the BBB. By comparing the permeability x surface area product (PS,) of reference substances with those of NPs, we observed that NPs crossed the BBB. model two times more effectively than C-14-sucrose and sodium fluorescein (NaFl) and up to 60x better than Evans Blue labeled albumin (EBA). Our results clearly indicate that NPs cross the BBB model effectively. Furthermore, Cu was shielded by the NPs, which decreased the Cu toxicity. The novel design of the core shell NP enabled the complexation of Cu(II) in the outer shell and therefore facilitated the pH-dependent release of Cu in contrast to core-multishell NPs, where the Cu(II) ions are encapsulated in the core. This allows a release of Cu into the cytoplasm. In addition, by using a cellular detection system based on a metal response element with green fluorescent protein (MRE-GFP), we demonstrated that Cu could also be released intracellularly from NPs and is accessible for biological processes. Our results indicate that NPs are potential candidates to rebalance metal-ion homeostasis in disease conditions affecting brain and neuronal systems.

Utility of measuring serum or red blood cell folate in the era of folate fortification of flour	CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Review						Folic acid; Folate; Fortification; Serum; Red blood cells; Test utility	INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; FOLIC-ACID FORTIFICATION; LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS; MICROBIOLOGIC ASSAY; METHYLMALONIC ACID; LC-MS/MS; DEFICIENCY; HOMOCYSTEINE; VITAMIN-B-12; COBALAMIN	Folic acid is an essential nutrient involved in one-carbon metabolism. Insufficient folate can result in megaloblastic anemia and an increased risk of neural tube defects. In response to the latter, some governments have mandated the fortification of flour with folate. This had resulted in a documented rise in the serum and red blood cell folate levels in the population. This has impacted the potential utility of folate measurements to detect folate deficiency in the clinical context. Folate measurements, whether done in serum or red blood cells, are subject to analytical variation, especially the latter, which also affects the utility of such measurements. Examining the literature reveals that in clinical situations, generally < 1% of the subjects will have folate deficiency regardless of potentially pre-disposing factors (e.g. anemia, anti-folate agents, inflammatory bowel disease). Data from our center for both pediatric and adult populations is presented that supports this observation. Consequently, there exists very few indications for folate determinations (unexplained macrocytosis, inborn errors of metabolism) and it may be more efficient to simply treat suspected cases.

The present research seeks deeper insights into these intrinsically motivating mechanisms by investigating neurophysiological correlates of cognitive absorption in the context of enactive learning, specifically simulation-based training on the use of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. An experiment was conducted in which 36 student trainees used ERP software to make decisions while running a simulated company. Consistent with flow theory, skill, difficulty, and their interaction significantly influenced cognitive absorption (R-2 = .16). Five neurophysiological measures were captured for each trainee: EEG alpha, EEG beta, electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate, and heart rate variability. Each of the five neurophysiological measures explained significant unique variance in cognitive absorption over and above skill, difficulty, and their interaction, and collectively more than doubled the explained variance to R-2 = .34. Overall, cognitive absorption was positively related to a more relaxed, less vigilant state. Cognitive absorption was significantly related to the training outcome. These findings provide new insights into the psychological states that are conducive to experiencing cognitive absorption during enactive training. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite these deleterious effects, homozygosity is high (5%-15%) in many populations, and among the highest in Mediterranean regions, where malaria was historically endemic and may have conferred a selective advantage for other mutations. We infected Mthfr-deficient (Mthfr(+/-)) and MTHFR overexpressing (MTHFRTg) mice with Plasmodium bergheiANKA to induce cerebral malaria. Mthfr(+/-) mice survived longer (P<0.02, log-rank test), and MTHFRTg mice died earlier (P<0.05, log-rank test) after infection compared with wild-type littermates. Flow cytometry revealed increased lymphocyte populations and increased CCR4(+) NK cells in spleen of Mthfr(+/-) mice; MTHFRTg animals had decreased numbers of these NK cells. Interferon- and interleukin-10 immunoreactive proteins were increased and decreased, respectively, in brain of Mthfr(+/-) mice compared with wild-type. We suggest that mild MTHFR deficiency protects against malarial infection and that this phenomenon may have led to the high frequency of the 677C>T/c.665C>T variant in human populations.

A previous phase II study suggested possible clinical benefit. OBJECTIVE To examine whether CoQ10 could slow disease progression in early PD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial at 67 North American sites consisting of participants 30 years of age or older who received a diagnosis of PD within 5 years and who had the following inclusion criteria: the presence of a rest tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity; a modified Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2.5 or less; and no anticipated need for dopaminergic therapy within 3 months. Exclusion criteria included the use of any PD medication within 60 days, the use of any symptomatic PD medication for more than 90 days, atypical or drug-induced parkinsonism, a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) rest tremor score of 3 or greater for any limb, a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 25 or less, a history of stroke, the use of certain supplements, and substantial recent exposure to CoQ10. Of 696 participants screened, 78 were found to be ineligible, and 18 declined participation. INTERVENTIONS The remaining 600 participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo, 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, or 2400 mg/d of CoQ10; all participants received 1200 IU/d of vitamin E. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participants were observed for 16 months or until a disability requiring dopaminergic treatment. The prospectively defined primary outcome measure was the change in total UPDRS score (Parts I-III) from baseline to final visit. The study was powered to detect a 3-point difference between an active treatment and placebo. RESULTS The baseline characteristics of the participants were well balanced, the mean age was 62.5 years, 66% of participants were male, and the mean baseline total UPDRS score was 22.7. A total of 267 participants required treatment (94 received placebo, 87 received 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, and 86 received 2400 mg/d of CoQ10), and 65 participants (29 who received placebo, 19 who received 1200 mg/d of CoQ10, and 17 who received 2400 mg/d of CoQ10) withdrew prematurely. Treatments were well tolerated with no safety concerns. The study was terminated after a prespecified futility criterion was reached. At study termination, both active treatment groups showed slight adverse trends relative to placebo. Adjusted mean changes (worsening) in total UPDRS scores from baseline to final visit were 6.9 points (placebo), 7.5 points (1200 mg/d of CoQ10; P =.49 relative to placebo), and 8.0 points (2400 mg/d of CoQ10; P =.21 relative to placebo). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Coenzyme Q10 was safe and well tolerated in this population, but showed no evidence of clinical benefit.	[Beal, M.

However, in REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is a rare neurological condition, muscle atonia is lost, leaving afflicted individuals free to enact their dreams. Although this may sound innocuous, it is not, given that patients with RBD often injure themselves or their bed-partner. A major concern in RBD is that it precedes, in 80% of cases, development of synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). This link suggests that neurodegenerative processes initially target the circuits controlling REM sleep. Clinical and basic neuroscience evidence indicates that RBD results from breakdown of the network underlying REM sleep atonia. This finding is important because it opens new avenues for treating RBD and understanding its link to neurodegenerative disorders.

OHNs sense diverse environmental cues and control arousal accordingly. For unknown reasons, OHNs contain multiple excitatory transmitters, including OH peptides and glutamate. To analyze their cotransmission within computational frameworks for control, we optogenetically stimulated OHNs and examined resulting outputs (spike patterns) in a downstream arousal regulator, the histamine neurons (HANs). OHR2s were essential for sustained HAN outputs. OHR2-dependent HAN output increased linearly during constant OHN input, suggesting that the OHN -> HAN(OHR2) module may function as an integral controller. OHN stimulation evoked OHR2-dependent slow postsynaptic currents, similar to midnanomolar OH concentrations. Conversely, glutamate-dependent output transiently communicated OHN input onset, peaking rapidly then decaying alongside OHN -> HAN glutamate currents. Blocking glutamate-driven spiking did not affect OH-driven spiking and vice versa, suggesting isolation (low cross-modulation) of outputs. Therefore, in arousal regulators, cotransmitters may translate distinct features of OHN activity into parallel, nonredundant control signals for downstream effectors.

A comparative study of the neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive phenotype in two microdeletion syndromes: Velocardiofacial (22q11.2 deletion) and Williams (7q11.23 deletion) syndromes	EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						22q11.2 deletion syndrome; Williams syndrome; Executive functions; Visuospatial functions; Psychiatric manifestation	PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; BEHAVIORAL-PHENOTYPE; MENTAL ROTATION; BRAIN ANATOMY; NEURAL BASIS; CHILDREN; DYSFUNCTION; COGNITION; MRI	Purpose: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) and Williams syndrome (WS) are common neurogenetic microdeletion syndromes. The aim of the present study was to compare the neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive phenotypes of 22q11.2DS and WS. Methods: Forty-five individuals with 22q11.2DS, 24 with WS, 22 with idiopathic developmental disability (DD) and 22 typically developing (TD) controls were compared for the rates of psychiatric disorders as well as cognitive executive and visuospatial functions. Results: We found that while anxiety, mood and disruptive disorders had an equally high prevalence among individuals with 22q11.2DS, WS and DDs, the 22q11.2DS group had the highest rates of psychotic disorders and the WS group had the highest rates of specific phobia. We also found that the WS group demonstrated more severe impairments in both executive and visuospatial functions than the other groups. WS and 22q11.2DS subjects had worse Performance-IQ than Verbal-IQ, a feature typical of nonverbal learning disorders. Conclusion: These findings offer a wide perspective on unique versus common phenotypes in 22q11.2DS and WS. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The antenatal administration of steroids has been universally implemented. They have not only been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), but also have an impact on the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and possibly retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) by reducing the need for supplemental oxygen due to improved lung function. The postnatal use of dexamethasone in ventilated infants has been adopted with caution, as there have been several reports of long-term neurodevelopmental complications with this therapy. Hence, changes in dosage and indications and the search for alternative therapies has emerged. Hydrocortisone appears to be a good alternative, with reassuring long-term evaluations thus far.

The effect of treating FIMR with annuloplasty is unclear when mitral regurgitation is moderate. Myocardial revascularization alone has been shown to improve mitral valve function. Methods: We randomized 31 patients with moderate (grade 2-4) FIMR to receive either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone or CABG plus downsizing mitral ring annuloplasty. The patients were followed up for clinical outcomes and echocardiographic assessment of mitral valve function and left ventricular dimensions at 3 and 12 months. Clinical improvement was assessed using the Minnesota quality-of-life questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, and brain natriuretic peptide levels. Results: The clinical course was similar in the 2 groups of patients during the study period. FIMR was perfectly corrected intraoperatively in the ring group. Echocardiographic follow-up at 3 months showed no difference in the FIMR grade between the 2 groups (66% less than grade 2 in the CABG alone and 86% in the CABG plus ring group; P = .316). The improvement in the CABG alone group was even more marked at 12 months (85% less than grade 2 in the CABG group and 85% in the CABG plus ring group). The left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly better at 3 months in the CABG alone group, although at 12 months, the left ventricular ejection fraction in the 2 groups had improved similarly. Conclusions: Although initially effective at reducing moderate FIMR, the addition of a ring did not change the clinical course after CABG surgery. At 12 months, no echocardiographic difference was found in terms of residual mitral regurgitation, left ventricular dimensions and function, or clinical outcomes.

The failure of most therapies can be attributed to the delicate location of these tumors and to the selection of therapies on the basis of assumptions that DIPGs are molecularly similar to adult disease. Recent studies have unraveled the unique genetic makeup of this brain cancer, with nearly 80% found to harbor a p.Lys27Met histone H3.3 or p.Lys27Met histone H3.1 alteration. However, DIPGs are still thought of as one disease, with limited understanding of the genetic drivers of these tumors. To understand what drives DIPGs, we integrated whole-genome sequencing with methylation, expression and copy number profiling, discovering that DIPGs comprise three molecularly distinct subgroups (H3-K27M, silent and MYCN) and uncovering a new recurrent activating mutation affecting the activin receptor gene ACVR1 in 20% of DIPGs. Mutations in ACVR1 were constitutively activating, leading to SMAD phosphorylation and increased expression of the downstream activin signaling targets ID1 and ID2. Our results highlight distinct molecular subgroups and novel therapeutic targets for this incurable pediatric cancer.

FORGE Canada Consortium	De novo CCND2 mutations leading to stabilization of cyclin D2 cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyriapolydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							INTERMEDIATE PROGENITOR CELLS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; AKT3; MICE; NEOCORTEX; PIK3CA	Activating mutations in genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway components cause megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome (MPPH, OMIM 603387)(1-3). Here we report that individuals with MPPH lacking upstream PI3K-AKT pathway mutations carry de novo mutations in CCND2 (encoding cyclin D2) that are clustered around a residue that can be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 313 (GSK-3 beta)(4). Mutant CCND2 was resistant to proteasomal degradation in vitro compared to wild-type CCND2. The PI3K-AKT pathway modulates GSK-3 beta activity(4), and cells from individuals with PIK3CA, PIK3R2 or AKT3 mutations showed similar CCND2 accumulation. CCND2 was expressed at higher levels in brains of mouse embryos expressing activated AKT3. In utero electroporation of mutant CCND2 into embryonic mouse brains produced more proliferating transfected progenitors and a smaller fraction of progenitors exiting the cell cycle compared to cells electroporated with wild-type CCND2. These observations suggest that cyclin D2 stabilization, caused by CCND2 mutation or PI3K-AKT activation, is a unifying mechanism in PI3K-AKT-related megalencephaly syndromes.

Dopamine Preferentially Inhibits NMDA Receptor-Mediated EPSCs by Acting on Presynaptic D-1 Receptors in Nucleus Accumbens during Postnatal Development	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EXCITATORY SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; LOCAL-ANESTHETIC INHIBITION; PAIRED-PULSE FACILITATION; VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT BLOCK; RAT HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; D-ASPARTATE RECEPTORS; MEDIUM SPINY NEURONS; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; IN-VITRO; IDENTIFIED NEURONS	Nucleus accumbens (nAcb), a major site of action of drugs of abuse and dopamine (DA) signalling in MSNs (medium spiny neurons), is critically involved in mediating behavioural responses of drug addiction. Most studies have evaluated the effects of DA on MSN firing properties but thus far, the effects of DA on a cellular circuit involving glutamatergic afferents to the nAcb have remained rather elusive. In this study we attempted to characterize the effects of dopamine (DA) on evoked glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in nAcb medium spiny (MS) neurons in 1 to 21 day-old rat pups. The EPSCs evoked by local nAcb stimuli displayed both AMPA/KA and NMDA receptor-mediated components. The addition of DA to the superfusing medium produced a marked decrease of both components of the EPSCs that did not change during the postnatal period studied. Pharmacologically isolated AMPA/KA receptor-mediated response was inhibited on average by 40% whereas the isolated NMDA receptor-mediated EPSC was decreased by 90%. The effect of DA on evoked EPSCs were mimicked by the D-1-like receptor agonist SKF 38393 and antagonized by the D1-like receptor antagonist SCH 23390 whereas D-2-like receptor agonist or antagonist respectively failed to mimic or to block the action of DA. DA did not change the membrane input conductance of MS neurons or the characteristics of EPSCs produced by the local administration of glutamate in the presence of tetrodotoxin. In contrast, DA altered the paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs. The present results show that the activation D1-like dopaminergic receptors modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission by preferentially inhibiting NMDA receptor-mediated EPSC through presynaptic mechanisms.

Design: Survey, cross-sectional study, and model testing. Setting: Web-based measures were completed by parents residing in North America in their home/community. Participants: Parents (N=576) of children and youth with and without disabilities, (n=282 and n=294, respectively), ages 5 to 17 years (mean age, 11y 2mo), completed the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The PEM-CY measured levels of participation frequency and involvement, as well as environmental barriers and supports of participation, in each of the following 3 settings: home, school, and community. Information about the child's health condition and functional issues was also collected. Results: All 3 models fit the data well (comparative fit index, .89.97) and explained 50% to 64% of the variance of participation frequency and involvement. Environmental bathers and supports served as significant mediators between child/personal factors (income, health condition, functional issues) and participation outcomes, across all models. The effect of the environment was most pronounced, however, in the community setting. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the unique role of the environment in explaining children's participation across different settings and, therefore, support the development of interventions targeting modifiable environmental factors.

Methods: A single-arm prospective pilot study of NMES, applied daily to both quadriceps muscles for six weeks. Participants were recruited from patients referred to a hospital-based multi-disciplinary supportive care team specializing in treatment of patients with nutritional depletion and functional decline. Results: Of the 15 participants who underwent baseline testing, 10 (67%) completed the study and only one (7%) withdrew because of discomfort due to NMES treatment. 7/10 (70%) of participants used NMES at least three times a week for the duration of the study. Use of NMES did not lead to significant improvements in physical performance tests. Conclusions: NMES is a feasible and acceptable intervention for home use in patients with cancer, poor performance status and metastatic disease. However, whether NMES is an effective strategy to stabilize or improve physical performance in such patients is not proven.	[Windholz, Tamara; Swanson, Tara; Vanderbyl, Brandy L.; Jagoe, R.

Many diverse etiologies have been associated with infantile spasms, but the pathophysiological process is still not fully understood. We describe 2 cases of previously healthy 1- and 3-month-old infants who suffered a nonaccidental head injury with extensive cerebral lesions. Both presented with acute focal seizures rapidly controlled with phenobarbital. Nevertheless, they developed infantile spasms after a latency period of 3-4 months. Spasms were rapidly controlled with vigabatrin. Both children manifested with developmental delay, either exacerbated (case 1) or elicited (case 2) by infantile spasms. Our report highlights nonaccidental head injury as a risk factor for developing infantile spasms following a seizure-free latency period. A better understanding of the pathophysiology linking accidental brain trauma with infantile spasms could lead to more effective neuroprotective strategies. In the meantime, increased awareness and follow-up are warranted.

The sleep of 10 first-break, drugnaive young adults with schizophrenia and 10 controls was recorded. Four basic DSS patterns were scored: 1) the transitional EEG-mixed intermediate stage (EMIS); 2) Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep without rapid eye movement (RSWR); 3) REM sleep without atonia (RSWA); and 4) non-REM sleep with rapid eye movements. An intermediate sleep (IS) score was calculated by summing EMIS and RSWR scores, and the durations of intra-REMsleep periods IS (IRSPIS) and IS scored "at the expense" of REM sleep (ISERS) were determined. Patients were administered the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) at the time of recording. Proportions of each DSS variables over total sleep time and proportions of IRSPIS and ISERS over REM sleep duration were compared between patients and controls. Correlation coefficients between DSS variables and BPRS total scores were calculated. The proportion of total DSS did not differ between patients and controls. Among DSS subtypes, RSWA was significantly increased in patients while other comparisons showed no significant differences. Significant positive correlations were found between BPRS scores and proportions of DSS, IS, RSWR, IRSPIS and ISERS over total sleep and REM sleep durations. These results demonstrate the functional instability of REM sleep in first-break, drug naive young adults with schizophrenia and unveil a pattern reminiscent of REM sleep behavior disorder. The significant correlation suggests that schizophrenia and REM sleep share common neuronal control mechanisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lead Exposure Disrupts Global DNA Methylation in Human Embryonic Stem Cells and Alters Their Neuronal Differentiation	TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Heavy metal; lead; human embryonic stem cell; neuronal differentiation; DNA methylation	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; EARLY-LIFE; IN-VITRO; NEURAL DIFFERENTIATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGIN; ADULT NEUROGENESIS; SYNAPTIC FUNCTION; AGING BRAIN; RAT-BRAIN	Exposure to lead (Pb) during childhood can result in learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Although described in animal models, whether Pb exposure also alters neuronal differentiation in the developing brains of exposed children is unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of physiologically relevant concentrations of Pb (from 0.4 to 1.9 mu M) on the capacity of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to progress to a neuronal fate. We found that neither acute nor chronic exposure to Pb prevented hESCs from generating neural progenitor cells (NPCs). NPCs derived from hESCs chronically exposed to 1.9 mu M Pb throughout the neural differentiation process generated 2.5 times more TUJ1-positive neurons than those derived from control hESCs. Pb exposure of hESCs during the stage of neural rosette formation resulted in a significant decrease in the expression levels of the neural marker genes PAX6 and MSI1. Furthermore, the resulting NPCs differentiated into neurons with shorter neurites and less branching than control neurons, as assessed by Sholl analysis. DNA methylation studies of control, acutely treated hESCs and NPCs derived from chronically exposed hESCs using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip demonstrated that Pb exposure induced changes in the methylation status of genes involved in neurogenetic signaling pathways. In summary, our study shows that exposure to Pb subtly alters the neuronal differentiation of exposed hESCs and that these changes could be partly mediated by modifications in the DNA methylation status of genes crucial to brain development.

Acrolein activates cell survival and apoptotic death responses involving the endoplasmic reticulum in A549 lung cells	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH			English	Article						Acrolein; Apoptosis; ER stress; Endoplasmic reticulum; Caspase; Calpain	UNFOLDED PROTEIN RESPONSE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE BRAIN; INDUCED DNA-DAMAGE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ER STRESS; INDUCED CYTOTOXICITY; ALDEHYDE ACROLEIN; RECEPTOR PATHWAY; CARBONYL STRESS; BOUND ACROLEIN	Acrolein, a highly reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde, is a product of endogenous lipid peroxidation. It is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant that is generated mainly by smoke, overheated cooking oil and vehicle exhaust. Acrolein damages cellular proteins, which could lead to accumulation of aberrantly-folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This study determines the mechanisms involved in acrolein-induced apoptosis mediated by the ER and possible links with the ER stress response in human A549 lung cells. The exposure of cells to acrolein (15-50 mu M) for shorter times of 15 to 30 min activated several ER stress markers. These included the ER chaperone protein BiP and the three ER sensors: (i) the survival/rescue molecules protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha) were phosphorylated; (ii) cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) occurred, and (iii) inositol-requiring protein-1 alpha (IRE1 alpha) was phosphorylated. Acrolein (25-50 mu M) caused apoptotic cell death mediated by the ER after 2 h, which was characterised by the induction of CHOP and activation of ER proteases calpain and caspase-4. Calpain and caspase-7 were the initiating factors for caspase-4 activation in acrolein-induced apoptosis. These results increase our knowledge about cellular responses to acrolein in lung cells, which have implications for human health. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Trudeau, L				Trudeau, Luc			Central Blood Pressure as an Index of Antihypertensive Control: Determinants and Potential Value	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Review							CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; CENTRAL AORTIC PRESSURE; ARTERIAL STIFFNESS; ESSENTIAL-HYPERTENSION; EUROPEAN-SOCIETY; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; LOWERING DRUGS; PULSE PRESSURE; BETA-BLOCKING; END-POINT	The measurement of central blood pressure has generated interest as a tool in predicting cardiovascular events. The purpose of this article is to review the meaning and measurement of the central blood pressure and consider its potential value as an index of the antihypertensive response. Indirect estimation of central aortic pressures is obtained by the study of the radial pulse wave compared with a central pulse wave contour measured at the carotid or femoral artery level. The sum of the forward pressure wave created by ventricular contraction and of the reflected pressure wave from the peripheral arterial system produce the peak systolic blood pressure in the aorta. Measurement of the peripheral reflected-wave contribution to aortic blood pressure can be quantified as the augmentation index. Also, the increase in the rapidity of this travelling wave can be measured as the pulse wave velocity. These 2 parameters are considered to be valid indices of the peripheral arterial stiffness. Along with the calculation of systolic and diastolic aortic pressures, these measurements can give a better understanding of the actual central blood pressure to which core organs like heart, brain, and kidneys are submitted. There is tantalizing evidence for the potential value of central blood pressure as a useful index of antihypertensive action, but until clear evidence is obtained, its use should continue to be considered exploratory.

MAVAN Study Team	Transgenerational effects of maternal care interact with fetal growth and influence attention skills at 18 months of age	EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Infant; Small for gestational age; Infant care; Attention	FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE; PARENTAL BONDING INSTRUMENT; EMOTIONAL ASSESSMENT ITSEA; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; FAMILY ENVIRONMENT; GENETIC INFLUENCE; STRESS RESPONSES; CHILDHOOD ABUSE	Background: Evidence suggests that there is an association between being born small for gestational age (SGA) and an increased risk of internalizing and externalizing problems, such as ADHD. Additionally, individuals who report having received a lower quality of maternal care show an increased prevalence of depression and anxiety, and they are generally worse caregivers of their offspring. Therefore, an interaction between the birth weight status and the quality of maternal care perceived by the mother could affect behavioral outcomes of the children. Aims: Evaluate the influence of being born SGA and parental bonding, as perceived by the mother during her infancy, on the children's behavior at 18 months of age. Study design: Nested cross-sectional study within a Canadian prenatal cohort (MAVAN, Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment) recruited from 2003 to 2010. Subjects: Data from 305 children who were evaluated at 18 months of age. Outcome measures: Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire ECBQ and Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment ITSEA) were included. Results: Children born SGA whose mothers reported low maternal care during her infancy (using the Parental Bonding Instrument PBI) showed lower scores in the attentional set shifting trait (ECBQ p = 0.002) and attention construct (ITSEA, p = 0.05) at 18 months of age. We also found that SGA increases decreases cuddliness (p = 0.011) and poor perceived maternal care decreases low intensity pleasure (p = 0.016) on the ECBQ Conclusions: These findings suggest a complex transgenerational transmission whereby mother's own care interacts with the fetal growth of her offspring to predict its attentional skills at 18 months of age.

Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are a specialized class of glia found exclusively in the olfactory system. OECs wrap olfactory sensory neuron axons and support their growth from the olfactory epithelium, and targeting to the olfactory bulb, during development and life-long regeneration. Because of this function and their ability to cross the boundary between central and peripheral nervous systems, OECs are attractive candidates for cell-based regenerative therapies to promote axonal repair in the injured nervous system. OECs are a molecularly, topologically and functionally heterogeneous group of cells and the mechanisms underlying the development and function of specific OEC subpopulations are poorly defined. This situation has affected the outcome and interpretation of OEC-based regenerative strategies. Here we show that the transcription factor Runx1 is selectively expressed in OECs of the inner olfactory nerve layer of the mouse olfactory bulb and in their precursors in the DEC migratory mass. Furthermore, we provide evidence that in vivo knockdown of mouse Runx1 increases the proliferation of the OECs in which Runx1 is expressed. Conversely, Runx1 overexpression in primary cultures of OECs reduces cell proliferation in vitro. Decreased Runx1 activity also leads to an increase in Runx1-expressing OEC precursors, with a parallel decrease in the number of more developmentally mature OECs. These results identify Runx1 as a useful new marker of a distinct OEC subpopulation and suggest that Runx1 is important for the development of this group of OECs. These observations provide an avenue for further exploration into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and function of specific DEC subpopulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As the publication in 2005 of a knowledge synthesis on conduct disorder in children and adolescents and the reply of the A << Pas de z,ro de conduiteA >> collaboration (literally: No F for Conduct) was a highly important event in the French mental health scene, it deserves a thorough discussion. In the hope of improving the practices and policies targeting children and their families, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the bones of contention between the proponents and opponents of a medical or rather biosocial model. To achieve this, we first analyze how this model assigns a central role to certain disorders defined and diagnosed based on constellations of symptoms. We then identify five dimensions which seem to hold center stage in the controversy: genetic susceptibility, neurocognitive deficits and temperament, the familial and social environment seen as a reservoir of stressors, large-scale screening for disorders using simple instruments and multi-modal treatments, including psychotropic medication. We take an interest in the French debate as this allows us to stand back from the models prevailing in North America. It also underscores the importance of multidisciplinary thinking and social sciences when elaborating clinical or political mental health guidelines.

Childhood cognitive ability accounts for associations between cognitive ability and brain cortical thickness in old age	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						cognitive ability; cognitive aging; cortical thickness; intelligence; IQ	LOTHIAN BIRTH COHORTS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; INTELLIGENCE; STABILITY; DISCOVERY; DEMENTIA; DISEASE; RISK; IQ	Associations between brain cortical tissue volume and cognitive function in old age are frequently interpreted as suggesting that preservation of cortical tissue is the foundation of successful cognitive aging. However, this association could also, in part, reflect a lifelong association between cognitive ability and cortical tissue. We analyzed data on 588 subjects from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 who had intelligence quotient (IQ) scores from the same cognitive test available at both 11 and 70 years of age as well as high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging data obtained at approximately 73 years of age. Cortical thickness was estimated at 81 924 sampling points across the cortex for each subject using an automated pipeline. Multiple regression was used to assess associations between cortical thickness and the IQ measures at 11 and 70 years. Childhood IQ accounted for more than two-third of the association between IQ at 70 years and cortical thickness measured at age 73 years. This warns against ascribing a causal interpretation to the association between cognitive ability and cortical tissue in old age based on assumptions about, and exclusive reference to, the aging process and any associated disease. Without early-life measures of cognitive ability, it would have been tempting to conclude that preservation of cortical thickness in old age is a foundation for successful cognitive aging when, instead, it is a lifelong association. This being said, results should not be construed as meaning that all studies on aging require direct measures of childhood IQ, but as suggesting that proxy measures of prior cognitive function can be useful to take into consideration.

Role of brain transmigrating neutrophils in depression-like behavior during systemic infection	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						depression; IL-1 beta; infection; inflammation; leptin; neutrophil; obesity; sickness behavior	INDUCED SICKNESS BEHAVIOR; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTERS; RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; HUMAN-LEUKOCYTES; MESSENGER-RNA; LEPTIN LEVELS; TNF-ALPHA; INFLAMMATION	Peripheral inflammation induces transmigration of interleukin (IL)-1 beta-expressing neutrophils to the brain. We investigated the possibility that this presents a new route of immune-to-brain communication by assessing their role in sickness behaviors relevant for mood disorders. Mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) developed despair-like behavior, and administration of an anti-polymorphonuclear antibody abolished LPS-induced despair-like and asocial behaviors, which correlated with the levels of IL-1 beta expression in the brain. These behavioral changes were directly mediated by the energy-regulating hormone, leptin. Increasing the concentration of endogenous leptin during obesity exacerbated, whereas its neutralization using a specific antiserum attenuated sickness behaviors and importantly the neutrophil transmigrating process. Our results indicate a role for peripheral neutrophils in conveying inflammatory signals to the brain, which appears to be dependent on the energy status of the organism. This constitutes a novel mechanism of immune-to-brain communication relevant to mood disorders.	[Aguliar-Valles, A.; Kim, J.; Jung, S.; Luheshi, G.

Mitochondrial allostatic load puts the 'gluc' back in glucocorticoids	NATURE REVIEWS ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							FISSION PROTEIN DRP1; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES; CHRONIC CORTICOSTERONE; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; DIABETES-MELLITUS; RESPIRATORY-CHAIN; TELOMERE LENGTH	The link between chronic psychosocial and metabolic stress and the pathogenesis of disease has been extensively documented. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms by which stressful life experiences and their associated primary neuroendocrine mediators cause biological damage and increase disease risk remain poorly understood. The allostatic load model of chronic stress focuses on glucocorticoid dysregulation. In this Perspectives, we expand upon the metabolic aspects of this model-particularly glucose imbalance-and propose that mitochondrial dysfunction constitutes an early, modifiable target of chronic stress and stress-related health behaviours. Central to this process is mitochondrial regulation of energy metabolism and cellular signalling. Chronically elevated glucose levels damage both mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA, generating toxic products that can promote systemic inflammation, alter gene expression and hasten cell ageing. Consequently, the concept of 'mitochondrial allostatic load' defines the deleterious structural and functional changes that mitochondria undergo in response to elevated glucose levels and stress-related pathophysiology.

The in vivo neuroreceptor imaging evidence also suggests alterations in the dopamine system in ADHD; however, the nature and behavioral significance of those have not yet been established. Here, we investigated striatal dopaminergic function in ADHD using [C-II]raclopride PET with a d-amphetamine challenge. We also examined the relationship of striatal dopamine responses to ADHD symptoms and neurocognitive function. A total of 15 treatment-free, noncomorbid adult males with ADHD (age: 29.87 +/- 8.65) and 18 healthy male controls (age: 25.44 +/- 6.77) underwent two PET scans: one following a lactose placebo and the other following d-amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.), administered double blind and in random order counterbalanced across groups. In a separate session without a drug, participants performed a battery of neurocognitive tests. Relative to the healthy controls, the ADHD patients, as a group, showed greater d-amphetamine-induced decreases in striatal [C-II]raclopride binding and performed more poorly on measures of response inhibition. Across groups, a greater magnitude of d-amphetamine-induced change in [I I graclopride binding potential was associated with poorer performance on measures of response inhibition and ADHD symptoms. Our findings suggest an augmented striatal dopaminergic response in treatment-naive ADHD. Though in contrast to results of a previous study, this finding appears consistent with a model proposing exaggerated phasic dopamine release in ADHD. A susceptibility to increased phasic dopamine responsivity may contribute to such characteristics of ADHD as poor inhibition and impulsivity.

The breakdown of the BNB allows access of blood-borne (hematogenous) cells and molecules to the endoneurium to engage in the local inflammatory cascade. This process was examined in a mouse model of trauma-associated neuropathic pain. The impact of nerve injury-triggered opening of the BNB in the development of chronic pain behavior was investigated. Partial ligation of the sciatic nerve led to a long-lasting disruption of the BNB distal to the site of injury. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was expressed by resident macrophages after nerve injury. Intraneural injection of VEGF decreased mechanical thresholds while opening the BNB. Serum from nerve-injured or lipopolysaccharide-treated animals elicited mechanical allodynia in naive animals, when allowed to bypass the BNB by intraneural injection. Intraneural injection of fibrinogen, a clotting protein in plasma that was found to deposit in the nerve after nerve injury, also produced a decrease in mechanical thresholds when introduced into naive nerves. These results demonstrate that blood-borne molecules may play a role in the generation of neuropathic pain, suggesting that pain may be driven from infection or injury, at a distance from the nervous system. Furthermore, the breakdown of the BNB in neuropathic conditions was exploited to permit the entry of analgesic molecules that typically cannot pass the BNB, such as ProToxin-II, a BNB-impermeable Nav1.7 inhibitor. Therapeutics utilizing this mechanism could have selective access to injured nerves over healthy tissues. (C) 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Lesage, S				Lesage, Sandra			Cesarean delivery under general anesthesia: Continuing Professional Development	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE			English	Article							RAPID-SEQUENCE INDUCTION; OUTMODED TECHNIQUE; DIFFICULT AIRWAY; SECTION; LABOR; OBSTETRICS; MANAGEMENT; ANALGESIA	Whenever possible, neuraxial anesthesia is the preferred technique for Cesarean delivery; however, under certain circumstances, general anesthesia remains the most appropriate choice. The purpose of this Continuing Professional Development module is to review the key issues regarding general anesthesia for Cesarean delivery. In developed countries, anesthesia-related maternal mortality and morbidity are both low. Mortality following Cesarean delivery under general anesthesia is attributable chiefly to failed intubation or other induction-related issues. Extubation can also be a danger period. The various methods of preventing difficult intubation and the associated consequences include airway assessment, fasting during obstetric labour, and pharmacological prophylaxis for aspiration. The traditional rapid sequence induction has been slightly modified because of the increased use of propofol and remifentanil. Difficult airway management algorithms specific to the pregnant woman are being developed and tend to recommend the use of supraglottic devices for unanticipated difficult intubation. The prevention of intraoperative awareness is another major consideration. Maintenance with halogenated agents at > 0.7 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is recommended; however, propofol maintenance can be an interesting option when uterine atony is present. Multimodal postoperative analgesia is recommended. A general anesthetic for Cesarean delivery should be based on the following principles: preventing aspiration, anticipating a difficult intubation, maintaining oxygenation, insuring materno-feto-placental perfusion and maintaining a deep level of anesthesia to avoid intraoperative awareness while minimizing neonatal effects.

Caspase-6 activity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus induces age-dependent memory impairment	CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; Caspase-6; cognitive impairment; aging; neurodegeneration	AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BETA-PEPTIDE; AXON DEGENERATION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; NEURON CULTURES; MCH2 ALPHA; CELL-DEATH; APOPTOSIS; ACTIVATION	Active Caspase-6 is abundant in the neuropil threads, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease brains. However, its contribution to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease is unclear. Here, we show that higher levels of Caspase-6 activity in the CA1 region of aged human hippocampi correlate with lower cognitive performance. To determine whether Caspase-6 activity, in the absence of plaques and tangles, is sufficient to cause memory deficits, we generated a transgenic knock-in mouse that expresses a self-activated form of human Caspase-6 in the CA1. This Caspase-6 mouse develops age-dependent spatial and episodic memory impairment. Caspase-6 induces neuronal degeneration and inflammation. We conclude that Caspase-6 activation in mouse CA1 neurons is sufficient to induce neuronal degeneration and age-dependent memory impairment. These results indicate that Caspase-6 activity in CA1 could be responsible for the lower cognitive performance of aged humans. Consequently, preventing or inhibiting Caspase-6 activity in the aged may provide an efficient novel therapeutic approach against Alzheimer disease.	[LeBlanc, A.

Although motor neurons have a high threshold for activation of HSP genes, HSP90 inhibitors are effective inducers. This study evaluated NXD30001, a novel, small molecule HSP90 inhibitor based on the radicicol backbone, for its ability to induce neuronal HSPs and for efficacy in an experimental model of ALS based on mutations in superoxide-dismutase 1 (SOD1). In motor neurons of dissociated murine spinal cord cultures, NXD30001-induced expression of HSP70/HSPA1 (iHSP70) and its co-chaperone HSP40/DNAJ through activation of HSF1 and exhibited a protective profile against SOD1(G93A) similar to geldanamycin, but with less toxicity. Treatment prevented protein aggregation, mitochondrial fragmentation, and motor neuron death, important features of mutant SOD1 toxicity, but did not effectively prevent aberrant intracellular Ca2+ accumulation. NXD30001 distributed to brain and spinal cord of wild-type and SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice following intraperitoneal injection; however, unlike in culture, in vivo levels of SOD1 were not reduced. NXD30001-induced expression of iHSP70 in skeletal and cardiac muscle and, to a lesser extent, in kidney, but not in liver, spinal cord, or brain, with either single or repeated administration. NXD30001 is a very useful experimental tool in culture, but these data point to the complex nature of HSP gene regulation in vivo and the necessity for early evaluation of the efficacy of novel HSP inducers in target tissues in vivo.

We report our experience in children using the Molecular Absorbent Recirculating System (MARSA (R)). Retrospective data from children receiving therapy using MARSA (R) from October 2009 to October 2012 were included in this single-center retrospective study. Patient characteristics, clinical presentation and complications of ALF, clinical and biological data before and after each MARSA (R) session, technical modalities and adverse events were recorded. A total of six children underwent 17 MARSA (R) sessions during the study period. Two adolescents were treated with the adult filter MARSFLUXA (R) and four infants were treated with the MiniMARSA (R) filter. The mean PEdiatric Logistic Dysfunction (PELOD) score at admission was 19 (range 11-33). All patients were mechanically ventilated, and four had acute kidney injury. The neurological course improved in one case, judged as stable in two cases and worsened in one case; data were unavailable in two cases. Mean serum ammonia levels decreased significantly following treatment with MARSA (R) from an initial 89 A +/- 29 to 58 A +/- 35 mcmol/L (p = 0.02). No other significant biological improvement was observed. Hemodynamic status improved/remained unchanged in the adolescent group, but in the infants four of the seven sessions were poorly tolerated and two sessions were aborted. Three patients died, two were successfully transplanted and one recovered without transplantation. In our experience, treatment with MARSA (R) is associated with encouraging results in adolescents, but it needs modification for very sick infants to improve tolerance.

Given that expression of membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) has been found to regulate expression of the autophagy biomarker Bc1-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), we sought to investigate possible signaling interplay mechanisms between MT1-MMP and BNIP3 in Concanavalin-A (ConA) lectin-activated U87 glioblastoma cells. ConA induced acidic vacuole organelle formation as well as BNIP3 and MT1-MMP gene and protein expressions, whereas only BNIP3 expression was dose-dependently inhibited by the JAK2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG490 suggesting a requirement for some STAT-mediated signaling. Gene silencing of MT1-MMP and of STAT3 abrogated ConA-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and BNIP3 expression. Correlative analysis shows that STAT3 signaling events occur downstream from MT1-MMP induction. Overexpression of a full length MT1-MMP recombinant protein led to increased BNIP3 gene and protein expressions. The cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP was also found necessary for transducing STAT3 phosphorylation. Among JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, only JAK2 gene silencing abrogated ConA's effects on MT1-MMP and BNIP3 gene and protein expressions. Our study elucidates how MT1-MMP signals autophagy, a process which could contribute to the chemoresistance phenotype in brain cancer cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, researchers have focused primarily on the anatomical features of the cerebral cortex, whereas subcortical structures, such as the basal ganglia (BG), have often been neglected despite extensive functional evidence on their relation with higher-order cognition. Here we performed shape analyses to understand how individual differences in BG local morphology account for variability in cognitive performance. Structural MRI was acquired in 104 young adults (45 men, 59 women, mean age = 19.83, SD = 1.64), and the outer surface of striatal structures (caudate, nucleus accumbens, and putamen), globus pallidus, and thalamus was estimated for each subject and hemisphere. Further, nine cognitive tests were used to measure fluid (Gf), crystallized (Gc), and spatial intelligence (Gv). Latent scores for these factors were computed by means of confirmatory factor analysis and regressed vertex-wise against subcortical shape (local displacements of vertex position), controlling for age, sex, and adjusted for brain size. Significant results (FDR < 5%) were found for Gf and Gv, but not Gc, for the right striatal structures and thalamus. The main results show a relative enlargement of the rostral putamen, which is functionally connected to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and other intelligence-related prefrontal areas.

Brain imaging studies in adults have shown that the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex is specifically involved in active controlled retrieval, and the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is specifically involved in monitoring mnemonic information (Petrides, 2005). Eighty-two children aged from 6 years, 8 months to 8 years, 7 months were tested. They showed equivalent success rates in active retrieval and monitoring with color and shape information. However, children were slower in monitoring than in active retrieval in color trials. The results demonstrate that the specialized contributions of the lateral prefrontal cortex emerge conjointly during childhood giving children multiple tools to exert an active control within memory.

Use of imaging biomarkers such as positron emission tomography (PET) with amyloid ligands, particularly in asymptomatic and pre-dementia stages of AD, however, has been the subject of debate (Dubois et al., 2013), with arguments both for and against the biomarker driven diagnosis of AD.

In pyramidal cells, TNF alpha drives the insertion of AMPA-type glutamate receptors into synapses, and contributes to the homeostatic regulation of circuit activity in the developing neocortex. Here we demonstrate that in the mouse dorsolateral striatum, TNF alpha drives the internalization of AMPARs and reduces corticostriatal synaptic strength, dephosphorylates DARPP-32 and GluA1, and results in a preferential removal of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs. Striatal TNF alpha signaling appears to be adaptive in nature, as TNF alpha is upregulated in response to the prolonged blockade of D2 dopamine receptors and is necessary to reduce the expression of extrapyramidal symptoms induced by chronic haloperidol treatment. These data indicate that TNF alpha is a regulator of glutamatergic synaptic strength in the adult striatum in a manner distinct from its regulation of synapses on pyramidal cells and mediates an adaptive response during pathological conditions.

It is still not clear if macrophages derived from these two populations differ in their roles after CNS injury. The aims of this study are to investigate the phagocytic response and clearance of damaged axons and tissue debris by these distinct subsets of macrophages and assess their viability after spinal cord injury (SCI). The lysozyme M EGFP-knockin mouse tags hematogenous macrophages, but not microglia. Using a combination of immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and neuronal tracing techniques, we show that microglia contact damaged axons early (24 h) after SCI and are the main type of macrophage to contain phagocytic material at 3 d. Thereafter, infiltrating macrophages become the predominant cell in contact with degenerating axons and contain more phagocytic material, which in contrast to microglia, persists for up to 42 d. Furthermore, after phagocytosis of myelin in vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophages are much more susceptible to apoptotic and necrotic cell death than CNS microglia, which is mirrored in vivo with apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells of infiltrating macrophage origin. This work suggests that microglia play a major role in the early response to SCI, by phagocytosing damaged and degenerating tissue, processing phagocytic material efficiently, and remaining viable. Later, macrophages of peripheral origin contribute predominantly to phagocytosis but are less efficient at processing CNS debris, and their death, in situ, may contribute to the secondary damage after CNS injury.

Because almost all studies focused on children with conduct problems or adult psychopaths, however, little is known about cognitive control mechanisms among the majority of persistent violent offenders who present an antisocial personality disorder(ASPD). The present study aimed to determine whether offenders with ASPD, relative to non-offenders, display dysfunction in the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control and to assess the extent to which these dysfunctions are associated with psychopathic traits and trait impulsivity. Participants comprised 21 violent offenders and 23 non-offenders who underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a non-verbal Stroop task. The offenders, relative to the non-offenders, exhibited reduced response time interference and a different pattern of conflict-and error-related activity in brain areas involved in cognitive control, attention, language, and emotion processing, that is, the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, superior temporal and postcentral cortices, putamen, thalamus, and amygdala. Moreover, between-group differences in behavioural and neural responses revealed associations with core features of psychopathy and attentional impulsivity. Thus, the results of the present study confirmed the hypothesis that offenders with ASPD display alterations in the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control and that those alterations relate, at least inpart, to personality characteristics.

Techniques for elucidating the structures of subjective life are sorely lacking in the cognitive sciences; as such, experiential reporting techniques must rise to meet both complex theories of brain function and increasingly sophisticated neuroimaging technologies. Analysis may offer valuable methods for bridging the gap between firstperson and third-person accounts of the mind. Using both systematic observational approaches alongside unstructured narrative interactions, psychoanalysts help patients articulate their experience and bring unconscious mental contents into awareness. Similar to seasoned meditators or phenomenologists, individuals who have undergone analysis are experts in discerning and describing their subjective experience, thus making them ideal candidates for neurophenomenology. Moreover, analytic techniques may provide a means of guiding untrained experimental participants to greater awareness of their mental continuum, as well as gathering subjective reports about fundamental yet elusive aspects of experience including selfhood, temporality, and inter-subjectivity. Mining psychoanalysis for its methodological innovations provides a fresh turn for the neuropsychoanalysis movement and cognitive science as a whole showcasing the integrity of analysis alongside the irreducibility of human experience.

The aim of this article is to review the clinical epidemiological features of AF and to relate them to underlying mechanisms. Long-established risk factors for AF include aging, male sex, hypertension, valve disease, left ventricular dysfunction, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Emerging risk factors include prehypertension, increased pulse pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, high-level physical training, diastolic dysfunction, predisposing gene variants, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. Potential risk factors are coronary artery disease, kidney disease, systemic inflammation, pericardial fat, and tobacco use. AF has substantial population health consequences, including impaired quality of life, increased hospitalization rates, stroke occurrence, and increased medical costs. The pathophysiology of AF centers around 4 general types of disturbances that promote ectopic firing and reentrant mechanisms, and include the following: (1) ion channel dysfunction, (2) Ca2+-handling abnormalities, (3) structural remodeling, and (4) autonomic neural dysregulation. Aging, hypertension, valve disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and endurance exercise training all cause structural remodeling. Heart failure and prior atrial infarction also cause Ca2+-handling abnormalities that lead to focal ectopic firing via delayed afterdepolarizations/triggered activity. Neural dysregulation is central to atrial arrhythmogenesis associated with endurance exercise training and occlusive coronary artery disease. Monogenic causes of AF typically promote the arrhythmia via ion channel dysfunction, but the mechanisms of the more common polygenic risk factors are still poorly understood and under intense investigation. Better recognition of the clinical epidemiology of AF, as well as an improved appreciation of the underlying mechanisms, is needed to develop improved methods for AF prevention and management.

The importance of the autonomic nervous system in atrial arrhythmogenesis is also supported by circadian variation in the incidence of symptomatic AF in humans. Methods that reduce autonomic innervation or outflow have been shown to reduce the incidence of spontaneous or induced atrial arrhythmias, suggesting that neuromodulation may be helpful in controlling AF. In this review, we focus on the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and the pathophysiology of AF and the potential benefit and limitations of neuromodulation in the management of this arrhythmia. We conclude that autonomic nerve activity plays an important role in the initiation and maintenance of AF, and modulating autonomic nerve function may contribute to AF control. Potential therapeutic applications include ganglionated plexus ablation, renal sympathetic denervation, cervical vagal nerve stimulation, baroreflex stimulation, cutaneous stimulation, novel drug approaches, and biological therapies. Although the role of the autonomic nervous system has long been recognized, new science and new technologies promise exciting prospects for the future.

CHD2 haploinsufficiency is associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy and neurobehavioural problems	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; CHD2; Developmental delay; Epilepsy; Learning disability	DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; COPY NUMBER VARIATION; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI; FAMILY; ENCEPHALOPATHIES; POPULATIONS; VARIANTS; PROTEINS	Background: The chromodomain helicase DNA binding domain (CHD) proteins modulate gene expression via their ability to remodel chromatin structure and influence histone acetylation. Recent studies have shown that CHD2 protein plays a critical role in embryonic development, tumor suppression and survival. Like other genes encoding members of the CHD family, pathogenic mutations in the CHD2 gene are expected to be implicated in human disease. In fact, there is emerging evidence suggesting that CHD2 might contribute to a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite growing evidence, a description of the full phenotypic spectrum of this condition is lacking. Methods: We conducted a multicentre study to identify and characterise the clinical features associated with haploinsufficiency of CHD2. Patients with deletions of this gene were identified from among broadly ascertained clinical cohorts undergoing genomic microarray analysis for developmental delay, congenital anomalies and/or autism spectrum disorder. Results: Detailed clinical assessments by clinical geneticists showed recurrent clinical symptoms, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, behavioural problems and autism-like features without characteristic facial gestalt or brain malformations observed on magnetic resonance imaging scans. Parental analysis showed that the deletions affecting CHD2 were de novo in all four patients, and analysis of high-resolution microarray data derived from 26,826 unaffected controls showed no deletions of this gene. Conclusions: The results of this study, in addition to our review of the literature, support a causative role of CHD2 haploinsufficiency in developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems, with phenotypic variability between individuals.

Materials and Methods: After a first MRI (MRI1), 29 ALS patients were clinically followed during 12 months; 14/29 patients underwent a second MRI (MRI2) at 1163 months. Cross-sectional area (CSA) that has been shown to be a marker of lower motor neuron degeneration was measured in cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord from T2-weighted images. Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial/radial/mean diffusivities (lambda(1), lambda(H1), MD) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) were measured within the lateral corticospinal tract in the cervical region. Imaging metrics were compared with clinical scales: Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and manual muscle testing (MMT) score. Results: At MRI1, CSA correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with MMT and arm ALSFRS-R scores. FA correlated significantly with leg ALFSRS-R scores. One year after MRI1, CSA predicted (P < 0.01) arm ALSFSR-R subscore and FA predicted (P, 0.01) leg ALSFRS-R subscore. From MRI1 to MRI2, significant changes (P < 0.01) were detected for CSA and MTR. CSA rate of change (i.e. atrophy) highly correlated (P < 0.01) with arm ALSFRS-R and arm MMT subscores rate of change. Conclusion: Atrophy and DTI metrics predicted ALS disease progression. Cord atrophy was a better biomarker of disease progression than diffusion and MTR. Our study suggests that multimodal MRI could provide surrogate markers of ALS that may help monitoring the effect of disease- modifying drugs.

Recent theorizing on the processes reflected by the N2pc suggests the possibility of distinct sets of neural mechanisms underlying its generation, one responsible for target activation, and one for distractor inhibition. To disentangle whether either or both of these mechanisms are impaired during the attentional blink, an RSVP sequence of circles, equidistant from fixation was used. The first target frame (T1) contained the same repeated target colour circle and target whereas the second target frame (T2) contained a distractor colour singleton as well as a target colour singleton. Only the target or only the distractor was presented at a lateral position; the other singleton was presented on the vertical midline so as not to elicit any event-related lateralization. Impaired T2 report accuracy at a short stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) was accompanied by a significant delay of the N2pc to lateral T2 targets when compared to a long SOA condition. No such delay was found when the lateralized stimulus was a distractor, suggesting that the attentional blink impacts attention allocation to targets, not distractors. We also observed a lateralized component earlier than the N2pc, a posterior contralateral positivity (Ppc) that did not depend on T1-T2 SOA and that was elicited by both lateral targets and distractors. We conclude that, contrary to N2pc, the Ppc likely reflects activity of bottom-up mechanisms responding unselectively to asymmetrical visual displays. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although discovered 25 y ago, the only experimentally confirmed example of this puzzling phenomenon is expression of the bacteriophage T4 gene 60. Bypassing requires translational blockage at a "takeoff codon" immediately upstream of a stop codon followed by a hairpin, which causes peptidyl-tRNA dissociation and reassociation with a matching "landing triplet" 50 nt downstream, where translation resumes. Here, we report 81 translational bypassing elements (byps) in mitochondria of the yeast Magnusiomyces capitatus and demonstrate in three cases, by transcript analysis and proteomics, that byps are retained in mitochondrial mRNAs but not translated. Although mitochondrial byps resemble the bypass sequence in the T4 gene 60, they utilize unused codons instead of stops for translational blockage and have relaxed matching rules for takeoff/landing sites. We detected byp-like sequences also in mtDNAs of several Saccharomycetales, indicating that byps are mobile genetic elements. These byp-like sequences lack bypassing activity and are tolerated when inserted in-frame in variable protein regions. We hypothesize that byp-like elements have the potential to contribute to evolutionary diversification of proteins by adding new domains that allow exploration of new structures and functions.

Int Consortium Blood Pressure Geno	Genetic Implication of a Novel Thiamine Transporter in Human Hypertension	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						hypertension; SLC35F3; thiamine; transporter	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; INHIBITORY PEPTIDE CATESTATIN; PRESSURE IN-VIVO; BLOOD-PRESSURE; AUTONOMIC ACTIVITY; NEUROENDOCRINE TRANSCRIPTOME; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; PLATE ASSAY	Objectives This study coupled 2 strategies-trait extremes and genome-wide pooling-to discover a novel blood pressure (BP) locus that encodes a previously uncharacterized thiamine transporter. Background Hypertension is a heritable trait that remains the most potent and widespread cardiovascular risk factor, although details of its genetic determination are poorly understood. Methods Representative genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) pools were created from male and female subjects in the highest-and lowest-fifth percentiles of BP in a primary care population of >50,000 patients. The peak associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms were typed in individual DNA samples, as well as in twins/siblings phenotyped for cardiovascular and autonomic traits. Biochemical properties of the associated transporter were evaluated in cellular assays. Results After chip hybridization and calculation of relative allele scores, the peak associations were typed in individual samples, revealing an association between hypertension, systolic BP, and diastolic BP and the previously uncharacterized solute carrier SLC35F3. The BP genetic association at SLC35F3 was validated by meta-analysis in an independent sample from the original source population, as well as the International Consortium for Blood Pressure Genome-Wide Association Studies (across North America and western Europe). Sequence homology to a putative yeast thiamine (vitamin B-1) transporter prompted us to express human SLC35F3 in Escherichia coli, which catalyzed [3H]-thiamine uptake. SLC35F3 risk-allele homozygotes (T/T) displayed decreased erythrocyte thiamine content on microbiological assay. In twin pairs, the SLC35F3 risk allele predicted heritable cardiovascular traits previously associated with thiamine deficiency, including elevated cardiac stroke volume with decreased vascular resistance, and elevated pressor responses to environmental (cold) stress. Allelic expression imbalance confirmed that cis variation at the human SLC35F3 locus influenced expression of that gene, and the allelic expression imbalance peak coincided with the hypertension peak. Conclusions Novel strategies were coupled to position a new hypertension-susceptibility locus, uncovering a previously unsuspected thiamine transporter whose genetic variants predicted several disturbances in cardiac and autonomic function. The results have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of systemic hypertension.

J	Therrien, M; Parker, JA				Therrien, Martine; Parker, J. Alex			Worming forward: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis toxicity mechanisms and genetic interactions in Caenorhabditis elegans	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS			English	Review								Neurodegenerative diseases share pathogenic mechanisms at the cellular level including protein misfolding, excitotoxicity and altered RNA homeostasis among others. Recent advances have shown that the genetic causes underlying these pathologies overlap, hinting at the existence of a genetic network for neurodegeneration. This is perhaps best illustrated by the recent discoveries of causative mutations for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). Once thought to be distinct entities, it is now recognized that these diseases exist along a genetic spectrum. With this wealth of discoveries comes the need to develop new genetic models of ALS and FTD to investigate not only pathogenic mechanisms linked to causative mutations, but to uncover potential genetic interactions that may point to new therapeutic targets. Given the conservation of many disease genes across evolution, Caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal system to investigate genetic interactions amongst these genes. Here we review the use of C. elegans to model ALS and investigate a putative genetic network for ALS/FTD that may extend to other neurological disorders.

This disease is characterized by overcrowding of the neural parenchyma at the craniocervical junction and disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. The most common clinical sign is pain either as a direct consequence of CM or neuropathic pain as a consequence of secondary syringomyelia. The etiology of CM remains unknown but genetic factors play an important role. To investigate the genetic complexity of the disease, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach was adopted. A total of 14 quantitative skull and atlas measurements were taken and were tested for association to CM. Six traits were found to be associated to CM and were subjected to a whole-genome association study using the Illumina canine high density bead chip in 74 GB dogs (50 affected and 24 controls). Linear and mixed regression analyses identified associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on 5 Canis Familiaris Autosomes (CFAs): CFA2, CFA9, CFA12, CFA14 and CFA24. A reconstructed haplotype of 0.53 Mb on CFA2 strongly associated to the height of the cranial fossa (diameter F) and an haplotype of 2.5 Mb on CFA14 associated to both the height of the rostral part of the caudal cranial fossa (AE) and the height of the brain (FG) were significantly associated to CM after 10 000 permutations strengthening their candidacy for this disease (P = 0.0421, P = 0.0094 respectively). The CFA2 QTL harbours the Sall-1 gene which is an excellent candidate since its orthologue in humans is mutated in Townes-Brocks syndrome which has previously been associated to Chiari malformation I. Our study demonstrates the implication of multiple traits in the etiology of CM and has successfully identified two new QTL associated to CM and a potential candidate gene.

Results: We describe BisQC, a step-by-step method for multiplexed bisulfite-converted DNA library construction, pooling, spike-in content, and bioinformatics. We demonstrate technical improvements for library preparation and bioinformatic analyses that can be done in standard laboratories. We find that decoupling amplification of bisulfite converted (bis) DNA from the indexing reaction is an advantage, specifically in reducing total PCR cycle number and pre-selecting high quality bis-libraries. We also introduce a progressive PCR method for optimal library amplification and size-selection. At the sequencing stage, we thoroughly test the benefits of pooling non-bis DNA library with bis-libraries and find that BisSeq libraries can be pooled with a high proportion of non-bis DNA libraries with minimal impact on BisSeq output. For informatics analysis, we propose a series of optimization steps including the utilization of the mitochondrial genome as a QC standard, and we assess the validity of using duplicate reads for coverage statistics. Conclusion: We demonstrate several quality control checkpoints at the library preparation, pre-sequencing, post-sequencing, and post-alignment stages, which should prove useful in determining sample and processing quality. We also determine that including a significant portion of non-bisulfite converted DNA with bisulfite converted DNA has a minimal impact on usable bisulfite read output.

However, an understanding of the functional role of higher auditory cortical areas in guiding attention to acoustic stimuli has been elusive. We recorded from neurons in two tonotopic cortical belt areas in the dorsal posterior ectosylvian gyrus (dPEG) of ferrets trained on a simple auditory discrimination task. Neurons in dPEG showed similar basic auditory tuning properties to A1, but during behavior we observed marked differences between these areas. In the belt areas, changes in neuronal firing rate and response dynamics greatly enhanced responses to target stimuli relative to distractors, allowing for greater attentional selection during active listening. Consistent with existing anatomical evidence, the pattern of sensory tuning and behavioral modulation in auditory belt cortex links the spectrotemporal representation of the whole acoustic scene in A1 to a more abstracted representation of task-relevant stimuli observed in frontal cortex.

It has been suggested that lack of dopamine induces disruption of neural interactions between prefrontal and premotor areas, which might underlie impairment of motor control observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study we recorded cortical activity with high-density electroencephalography in 11 patients with PD as a pathological model of dopamine deficiency, and 13 healthy control subjects. Participants performed repetitive extension-flexion movements of their right index finger, which were externally paced at a rate of 0.5 Hz. This required participants to align their movement velocity to the slow external pace. Patients were studied after at least 12-hour withdrawal of dopaminergic medication (OFF state) and after intake of the dopamine precursor levodopa (ON state) in order to examine oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor areas during respectively low and high levels of dopamine. In 10 patients and 12 control participants multiple source beamformer analysis yielded task-related activation of a contralateral cortical network comprising prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral premotor cortex (lPM), supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1). Dynamic causal modelling was used to characterize task-related oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor cortical areas. Healthy participants showed task-induced coupling from PFC to SMA, which was modulated within the gamma-band. In the OFF state, PD patients did not express any frequency-specific coupling between prefrontal and premotor areas. Application of levodopa reinstated task-related coupling from PFC to SMA, which was expressed as high-beta-gamma coupling. Additionally, strong within-frequency gamma-coupling as well as cross-frequency 9-y coupling was observed from PFC to 1PM. Enhancement of this cross-frequency 0-y coupling after application of levodopa was positively correlated with individual improvement in motor function. The results demonstrate that dopamine deficiency impairs the ability to establish oscillatory coupling between prefrontal and premotor areas during an externally paced motor task. Application of extrinsic dopamine in PD patients reinstates physiological prefrontal-premotor coupling and additionally induces within- and cross-frequency coupling from prefrontal to premotor areas, which is not expressed in healthy participants.

Comparison of Outcomes in Patients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Discharged on Versus Not on Statin Therapy (from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article							NORMAL CORONARY-ARTERIES; HORIZONS-AMI TRIAL; ATORVASTATIN; ANGIOGRAPHY; TOMOGRAPHY; DISEASE; ONSET	Statin therapy is indicated after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to reduce recurrent ischemic events, but approximately 6% of. patients with STEMI do not receive a statin prescription at discharge. This substudy aimed to define the clinical outcomes and patient characteristics associated with statin nonprescription after STEMI. We compared clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics and in-hospital, 30-day, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year outcomes in 3,512 patients discharged after STEMI with and without (6%) statin prescriptions in the harmonizing outcomes with revascularization and stents in acute myocardial infarction trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00433966). Statin nonprescription was associated with female sex, nonwhite race, previous bypass surgery, heart failure, renal impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, care in the United States, lower prescription rates of antiplatelets and neurohormonal antagonists, less percutaneous coronary intervention and stents, and, in 26% of cases, angiographically normal or nonobstructed coronary arteries. At every time point of follow-up after discharge, patients with no discharge statin prescription had significantly higher rates of net adverse clinical events, major adverse cardiac events, major bleeding unrelated to bypass surgery, and death. After multivariable adjustment, absence of a discharge statin prescription independently predicted 3-year major adverse cardiac event (hazard ratio 1.54,95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.07, p = 0.0037) and death (hazard ratio 2.30,95% confidence interval 1.41 to 3.77, p = 0.0009). In conclusion, within the framework of this randomized trial of patients presenting with STEMI, approximately 6% of patients were discharged without statin therapy.

Human VapB and Drosophila Vap-33-1 (Vap) are homologous type II transmembrane proteins that are localized to the ER. However, the precise consequences of the defects associated with the P56S mutation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its role in the pathology of ALS are not well understood. Here we show that Vap is required for ER protein quality control (ERQC). Loss of Vap in flies shows various ERQC associated defects, including protein accumulation, ER expansion, and ER stress. We also show that wild type Vap, but not the ALS8 mutant Vap, interacts with a lipid-binding protein, Oxysterol binding protein (Osbp), and that Vap is required for the proper localization of Osbp to the ER. Restoring the expression of Osbp in the ER suppresses the defects associated with loss of Vap and the ALS8 mutant Vap. Hence, we propose that the ALS8 mutation impairs the interaction of Vap with Osbp, resulting in hypomorphic defects that might contribute to the pathology of ALS8.

Several genes have been associated with hereditary forms of the disease and transgenic mice have been developed by a number of groups to produce animal models of PD and to explore the basic functions of these genes. Surprisingly, most of the various mouse lines generated such as Parkin KO, Pink1 KO, DJ-1 KO and LRRK2 transgenic have been reported to lack degeneration of nigral DA neuron, one of the hallmarks of PD. However, modest impairments of motor behavior have been reported, suggesting the possibility that the models recapitulate at least some of the early stages of PD, including early dysfunction of DA axon terminals. To further evaluate this possibility, here we provide for the first time a systematic comparison of DA release in four different mouse lines, examined at a young age range, prior to potential age-dependent compensations. Using fast scan cyclic voltammetry in striatal sections prepared from young, 6-8 weeks old mice, we examined sub-second DA overflow evoked by single pulses and action potential trains. Unexpectedly, none of the models displayed any dysfunction of DA overflow or reuptake. These results, compatible with the lack of DA neuron loss in these models, suggest that molecular dysfunctions caused by the absence or mutation of these individual genes are not sufficient to perturb the function and survival of mouse DA neurons.

In neuroscience, optogenetic protocols have been shown to efficiently inhibit or stimulate neuronal activity with a high temporal resolution. Among the technical challenges associated with the use of optogenetics, one is the ability to target a spatially specific population of neurons in a given brain structure. To address this issue, we developed a side-illuminating optical fiber capable of delivering light to specific sites in a target nucleus with added flexibility through rotation and translation of the fiber and by varying the output light power. The designed optical fiber was tested in vivo in visual structures of ChR2-expressing transgenic mice. To assess the spatial extent of neuronal activity modulation, we took advantage of the hallmark of the visual system: its retinotopic organization. Indeed, the relative position of ganglion cells in the retina is transposed in the cellular topography of both the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus and the primary visual cortex (V1). The optical fiber was inserted in the LGN and by rotating it with a motor, it was possible to sequentially activate different neuronal populations within this structure. The activation of V1 neurons by LGN projections was recorded using intrinsic optical imaging. Increasing light intensity (from 1.4 to 8.9 mW/mm(2)) led to increasing activation surfaces in V1. Optogenetic stimulation of the LGN at different translational and rotational positions was associated with different activation maps in V1. The position and/or orientation of the fiber inevitably varied across experiments, thus limiting the capacity to pool data. With the optogenetic design presented here, we demonstrate for the first time a transitory and spatially-concise activation of a deep neuronal structure. The optogenetic design presented here thus opens a promising avenue for studying the function of deep brain structures.

Ongoing work in this line of inquiry has also come to deeply influence another field: cognitive neuroscience of the normal aging. This complex process, once considered inevitable or beyond the reach of treatment, has been transformed into an arena of intense investigation and strategic intervention. However, important questions remain about this characterization of the aging brain, and the assumptions it makes about the social, cultural, and biological space occupied by cognition in the older individual and body. The following paper will provide a critical examination of the move from basic experiments on the neurophysiology of experience-dependent plasticity to the growing market for (and public conception of) cognitive aging as a medicalized space for intervention by neuroscience-backed technologies. Entangled with changing concepts of normality, pathology, and self-preservation, we will argue that this new understanding, led by personalized cognitive training strategies, is approaching a point where interdisciplinary research is crucial to provide a holistic and nuanced understanding of the aging process. This new outlook will allow us to move forward in a space where our knowledge, like our new conception of the brain, is never static.

At the earliest stages of their molecular differentiation, we can detect differences between medial and lateral LMC neurons in terms of expression of neurotransmitter receptor subunits, including CHRNA5, CHRNA7, GRIN2A, GRIK1, HTR1A and HTR1B, as well as the KCC2 transporter. Using patch-clamp recordings we also demonstrate that medial and lateral LMC motor neurons have subtly different activity patterns that reflect the differential expression of neurotransmitter receptor subunits. Using a combination of patch-clamp recordings in single neurons and calcium-imaging of motor neuron populations, we demonstrate that inhibition of nicotinic, muscarinic or GABA-ergic activity, has profound effects of motor circuit activity during the initial stages of neuromuscular junction formation. Finally, by analysing the activity of large populations of motor neurons at different developmental stages, we show that the asynchronous, disordered neuronal activity that occurs at early stages of circuit formation develops into organised, synchronous activity evident at the stage of LMC neuron muscle innervation. In light of the considerable diversity of neurotransmitter receptor expression, activity patterns in the LMC are surprisingly similar between neuronal types, however the emergence of patterned activity, in conjunction with the differential expression of transmitter systems likely leads to the development of near-mature patterns of locomotor activity by perinatal ages.

In consequence, according to the FLH, lexical stress should be processed by the left (language-dominant) hemisphere, given its linguistic function and small unit size. We performed an exhaustive search for case studies of patients with acquired dysprosody due to unilateral brain damage. In contrast to previous reviews we only regarded dysprosody at the lexical level (excluding phrasal stress). Moreover, we focused on the representational stage of lexical stress processing, excluding more peripheral perceptual or motor deficits. Applying these criteria, we included nine studies reporting on 11 patients. All of these patients showed representational deficits in word stress processing following a lesion in their language-dominant hemisphere. In 9 out of 11 patients, it was the left hemisphere which was affected. This is a much more consistent pattern as found in previous reviews, in which less rigorous inclusion criteria may have blurred the pattern of results. We conclude that the representation of lexical stress crucially relies on the functioning of the language-dominant (mostly left) hemisphere.

An influential model for the neurotypical brain suggests that face processing in the fusiform gyrus and the amygdala is based on both high-spatial frequency (HSF) information carried by a parvocellular pathway, and low-spatial frequency (LSF) information separately conveyed by a magnocellular pathway. Here, we tested the fusiform gyrus and amygdala sensitivity to emotional face information conveyed by these distinct pathways in ASD individuals (and matched Controls). During functional Magnetical Resonance Imaging (fMRI), participants reported the apparent gender of hybrid face stimuli, made by merging two different faces (one in LSF and the other in HSF), out of which one displayed an emotional expression (fearful or happy) and the other was neutral. Controls exhibited increased fusiform activity to hybrid faces with an emotional expression (relative to hybrids composed only with neutral faces), regardless of whether this was conveyed by LSFs or HSFs in hybrid stimuli. ASD individuals showed intact fusiform response to LSF, but not HSF, expressions. Furthermore, the amygdala (and the ventral occipital cortex) was more sensitive to HSF than LSF expressions in Controls, but exhibited an opposite preference in ASD. Our data suggest spared LSF face processing in ASD, while cortical analysis of HSF expression cues appears affected. These findings converge with recent accounts suggesting that ASD might be characterized by a difficulty in integrating multiple local information and cause global processing troubles unexplained by losses in low spatial frequency inputs.

Massive efforts have been made in the last few years to acquire high-dimensional neuroimaging and genetic data on large cohorts of subjects. The statistical analysis of such data is carried out with increasingly sophisticated techniques and represents a great computational challenge. Fortunately, increasing computational power in distributed architectures can be harnessed, if new neuroinformatics infrastructures are designed and training to use these new tools is provided. Combining a MapReduce framework (TomusBLOB) with machine learning algorithms (Scikit-learn library), we design a scalable analysis tool that can deal with non-parametric statistics on high-dimensional data. End-users describe the statistical procedure to perform and can then test the model on their own computers before running the very same code in the cloud at a larger scale. We illustrate the potential of our approach on real data with an experiment showing how the functional signal in subcortical brain regions can be significantly fit with genome-wide genotypes.

The apoptotic activity of p53 is tightly regulated by the apoptosis-stimulating proteins of p53 (ASPP) family members: ASPP1, ASPP2 and iASPP. We previously showed that the pro-apoptotic members ASPP1 and ASPP2 contribute to p53-dependent death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). However, the role of the p53 inhibitor iASPP in the central nervous system (CNS) remains to be elucidated. To address this, we asked whether iASPP contributes to the survival of RGCs in an in vivo model of acute optic nerve damage. We demonstrate that iASPP is expressed by injured RGCs and that iASPP phosphorylation at serine residues, which increase iASPP affinity towards p53, is significantly reduced following axotomy. We show that short interference RNA (siRNA)-induced iASPP knockdown exacerbates RGC death, whereas adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated iASPP expression promotes RGC survival. Importantly, our data also demonstrate that increasing iASPP expression in RGCs downregulates p53 activity and blocks the expression of pro-apoptotic targets PUMA and Fas/CD95. This study demonstrates a novel role for iASPP in the survival of RGCs, and provides further evidence of the importance of the ASPP family in the regulation of neuronal loss after axonal injury.

Approximately 30% of diabetic patients develop neuropathic pain, manifested as spontaneous pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. Hyperglycemia induces metabolic changes in peripheral tissues and enhances oxidative stress in nerve fibers. The damages and subsequent reactive inflammation affect structural properties of Schwann cells and axons leading to the release of neuropoietic mediators, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and pronociceptive mediators. Therefore, diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) shares some histological features and underlying mechanisms with traumatic neuropathy. DNP displays, however, other distinct features; for instance, sensory input to the spinal cord decreases rather than increasing in diabetic patients. Consequently, development of central sensitization in DNP involves mechanisms that are distinct from traumatic neuropathic pain. In DNP, the contribution of spinal cord microglia activation to central sensitization and pain processes is emerging as a new concept. Besides inflammation in the periphery, hyperglycemia and the resulting production of reactive oxygen species affect the local microenvironment in the spinal cord. All these alterations could trigger resting and sessile microglia to the activated phenotype. In turn, microglia synthesize and release pro-inflammatory cytokines and neuroactive molecules capable of inducing hyperactivity of spinal nociceptive neurons. Hence, it is imperative to elucidate glial mechanisms underlying DNP for the development of effective therapeutic agents. The present review highlights the recent developments regarding the contribution of spinal microglia as compelling target for the treatment of DNP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: The QPC was built by linking four administrative databases: RAMQ (medical and pharmaceutical data), Med-Echo (hospitalizations), ISQ (births/deaths), and MELS (Ministry of Education data). A self-administered questionnaire was sent to a random sample of women to collect lifestyle information. The QPC includes data on all pregnancies of women covered by the Quebec provincial prescription drug insurance between 1998 and 2008. Date of entry in the QPC is the first day of pregnancy, and women are followed during and after pregnancy; children are followed after birth up until 2009. The prevalence of prescribed medications before, during and after pregnancy was compared between time-window. Pregnancy outcomes were also estimated among pregnancies ending with a live born infant. Results: The QPC included 289,688 pregnancies of 186,165 women. Among them, 167,398 ended with a delivery representing 19.4% of all deliveries occurring in the Province of Quebec between 1998-2009. The total frequency of abortions was 35.9% in the QPC comparable to the 36.4% observed in the Province of Quebec. The prevalence of prescribed medication use was 74.6%, 59.0%, and 79.6% before, during and after pregnancy, respectively. Although there was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of use once the pregnancy was diagnosed (p <. 01), post-pregnancy prescribed medication use returned above the pre- pregnancy level. The prevalence of pregnancy outcomes found in the QPC were similar to those observed in the Province of Quebec. Conclusion: The QPC is an excellent tool for the study of the risk and benefit of drug use during the perinatal period. This cohort has the advantage of including a validated date of beginning of pregnancy giving the possibility of assigning the exact gestational age at the time of maternal exposure.

As CM associates with increased risk of several psychiatric disorders, early age of illness onset, increased comorbidity and negative clinical outcome, it imposes a major public health, social and economic impact. Although the clinical consequences of CM are well characterized, a major challenge remains to understand how negative early-life events can affect brain function over extended periods of time. We review here both animal and human studies indicating that the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation is a crucial mediator of early-life experiences, thereby maintaining life-long neurobiological sequelae of CM, and strongly determining psychopathological risk.

Studies have shown that smokers are roused by appetitive smoking-related stimuli, and their consumption tends to be unaffected by the negative value of smoking. Purpose: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the goal of this study was two-fold: to examine the brain reactivity of chronic smokers when processing the negative value of smoking using aversive smoking-related cues; to further characterize this response by comparing the latter to the processing of aversive nonsmoking-related and appetitive smoking-related cues. Method: Thirty chronic smokers passively viewed aversive smoking-related, aversive nonsmoking-related, appetitive smoking-related and neutral images presented in a block design while being scanned. Results: Aversive smoking-related stimuli elicited significantly greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus and lateral orbitofrontal cortex than neutral stimuli. Aversive smoking-related stimuli elicited lower activation in the parahippocampal gyrus, insula and inferior frontal gyrus compared to the aversive nonsmoking-related condition, as well as lower activation in the posterior cingulate, precuneus and medial prefrontal cortices compared to appetitive smoking-related cues. Conclusion: The brain activation pattern observed suggests that chronic smokers experience an aversive response when processing aversive smoking-related stimuli, however we argue that the latter triggers a weaker negative emotional and driving response than the aversive non-smoking-related and appetitive smoking-related cues respectively. These fMRI results highlight potentially important processes underlying the insensitivity to the negative value of smoking, an important characteristic of addiction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Emergence of Context-Dependent Variability across a Basal Ganglia Network	NEURON			English	Article							SOCIAL-CONTEXT; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; FOREBRAIN CIRCUIT; DOPAMINERGIC MODULATION; PARKINSONIAN PRIMATES; RECIPIENT THALAMUS; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; VOCAL PLASTICITY; STRIATAL NEURONS	Context dependence is a key feature of cortical-basal ganglia circuit activity, and in songbirds the cortical outflow of a basal ganglia circuit specialized for song, LMAN, shows striking increases in trial-by-trial variability and bursting when birds sing alone rather than to females. To reveal where this variability and its social regulation emerge, we recorded stepwise from corticostriatal (HVC) neurons and their target spiny and pallidal neurons in Area X. We find that corticostriatal and spiny neurons both show precise singing-related firing across both social settings. Pallidal neurons, in contrast, exhibit markedly increased trial-by-trial variation when birds sing alone, created by highly variable pauses in firing. This variability persists even when recurrent inputs from LMAN are ablated. These data indicate that variability and its context sensitivity emerge within the basal ganglia network, suggest a network mechanism for this emergence, and highlight variability generation and regulation as basal ganglia functions.

It can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, from subtle to severe or even life threatening, and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay in patients presenting with a range of conditions. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in widely different conditions and the fact that hyponatraemia is managed by clinicians with a broad variety of backgrounds have fostered diverse institution-and speciality-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment. To obtain a common and holistic view, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA), represented by European Renal Best Practice (ERBP), have developed the Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia. In addition to a rigorous approach to methodology and evaluation, we were keen to ensure that the document focused on patient-important outcomes and included utility for clinicians involved in everyday practice.

Initially introduced for the mapping of peptides and intact proteins from mammalian tissue sections, MALDI IMS applications now extend to a wide range of molecules including peptides, lipids, metabolites and xenobiotics. Technology and methodology are quickly evolving to push the limits of the technique forward. Within a short period of time, numerous protocols and concepts have been developed and introduced in tissue section preparation, nonexhaustively including in situ tissue chemistries and solvent-free matrix depositions. Considering the past progress and current capabilities, this Review aims to cover the different aspects and challenges of tissue section preparation for MALDI IMS.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed two cases of homicide perpetrators who were both diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome on the basis of a karyotype analysis. A neurocognitive assessment was also performed (MMSE, Frontal Assessment Battery, brain CT, and electroencephalogram). Results: Numerous intermediate risk factors of homicide were shared by our two cases, including dispositional (male gender, young age, low socioeconomic status), historical (prior arrest record and past conviction for any offense), contextual (unemployment), and clinical (alcohol abuse). Conclusion: It is important that clinicians go beyond obvious risk factors, such as chromosomal abnormalities, to pinpoint other meaningful risk factors and potentially facilitate preventive approaches.

Wavelet Domain Feature Extraction Scheme Based on Dominant Motor Unit Action Potential of EMG Signal for Neuromuscular Disease Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); discrete wavelet transform; electromyography (EMG); feature extraction; K-nearest neighborhood (KNN) classifier; motor unit action potentials (MUAP); myopathy	POWER SPECTRUM; DECOMPOSITION; DIAGNOSIS; DISORDERS; MUSCLES	In this paper, two schemes for neuromuscular disease classification from electromyography (EMG) signals are proposed based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) features. In the first scheme, a few high energy DWT coefficients along with the maximum value are extracted in a frame by frame manner from the given EMG data. Instead of considering only such local information obtained from a single frame, we propose to utilize global statistics which is obtained based on information collected from some consecutive frames. In the second scheme, motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) are first extracted from the EMG data via template matching based decomposition technique. It is well known that not all MUAPs obtained via decomposition are capable of uniquely representing a class. Thus, a novel idea of selecting a dominant MUAP, based on energy criterion, is proposed and instead of all MUAPs, only the dominant MUAP is used for the classification. A feature extraction scheme based on some statistical properties of the DWT coefficients of dominant MUAPs is proposed. For the purpose of classification, the K-nearest neighborhood (KNN) classifier is employed. Extensive analysis is performed on clinical EMG database for the classification of neuromuscular diseases and it is found that the proposed methods provide a very satisfactory performance in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and overall classification accuracy.

Topical Combinations to Treat Microvascular Dysfunction of Chronic Postischemia Pain	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							REFLEX SYMPATHETIC DYSTROPHY; STABLE ANGINA-PECTORIS; VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; SYNDROME-TYPE-I; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; PLATELET-AGGREGATION; TACTILE ALLODYNIA; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; NITRIC-OXIDE; WHOLE-BLOOD	BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) exhibit tissue abnormalities caused by microvascular dysfunction in the blood vessels of skin, muscle, and nerve. We tested whether topical combinations aimed at improving microvascular function would relieve allodynia in an animal model of CRPS. We hypothesized that topical administration of either (2)-adrenergic ((2)A) receptor agonists or nitric oxide (NO) donors given to increase arterial blood flow, combined with either phosphatidic acid (PA) or phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors to increase capillary blood flow, would effectively reduce allodynia and signs of microvascular dysfunction in the animal model of chronic pain. METHODS: Mechanical allodynia was induced in the hindpaws of rats with chronic postischemia pain (CPIP). Allodynia was assessed before and after topical application of vehicle, single drugs or combinations of an (2)A receptor agonist (apraclonidine) or an NO donor (linsidomine), with PA or PDE inhibitors (lisofylline, pentoxifylline). A topical combination of apraclonidine + lisofylline was also evaluated for its effects on a measure of microvascular function (postocclusive reactive hyperemia) and tissue oxidative capacity (formazan production by tetrazolium reduction) in CPIP rats. RESULTS: Each of the single topical drugs produced significant dose-dependent antiallodynic effects compared with vehicle in CPIP rats (N = 30), and the antiallodynic dose-response curves of either PA or PDE inhibitors were shifted 5- to 10-fold to the left when combined with nonanalgesic doses of (2)A receptor agonists or NO donors (N = 28). The potent antiallodynic effects of ipsilateral treatment with combinations of (2)A receptor agonists or NO donors with PA or PDE inhibitors were not reproduced by the same treatment of the contralateral hindpaw (N = 28). Topical combinations produced antiallodynic effects lasting up to 6 hours (N = 15) and were significantly enhanced by low-dose systemic pregabalin in early, but not late, CPIP rats (N = 18). An antiallodynic topical combination of apraclonidine + lisofylline was also found to effectively relieve depressed postocclusive reactive hyperemia in CPIP rats (N = 61) and to increase formazan production in postischemic tissues (skin and muscle) (N = 56). CONCLUSIONS: The present results support the hypothesis that allodynia in an animal model of CRPS is effectively relieved by topical combinations of (2)A receptor agonists or NO donors with PA or PDE inhibitors. This suggests that topical treatments aimed at improving microvascular function by increasing both arterial and capillary blood flow produce effective analgesia for CRPS.

J	Daoust, A; Racine, E				Daoust, Ariane; Racine, Eric			Depictions of 'brain death' in the media: medical and ethical implications	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article						Death; Neuroethics; Definition; Determination of Death; Journalism; Mass media; Clinical Ethics	CRITERIA; GUIDELINES; DIAGNOSIS; CANADA; WHOLE	Background Debates and controversies have shaped the understanding and the practices related to death determined by neurological criterion (DNC). Confusion about DNC in the public domain could undermine this notion. This confusion could further jeopardise confidence in rigorous death determination procedures, and raise questions about the integrity, sustainability, and legitimacy of modern organ donation practices. Objective We examined the depictions of brain death' in major American and Canadian print media to gain insights into possible common sources of confusion about DNC and the relationship between expert and lay views on this crucial concept. Methods We gathered 940 articles, available in electronic databases, published between 2005 and 2009 from high-circulation Canadian and American newspapers containing keywords brain dead' or brain death'. Articles were systematically examined for content (eg, definitions of brain death and criteria for determination of death) using the NVivo 8 software. Results Our results showed problematic aspects in American and Canadian media, with some salient differences. DNC was used colloquially in 39% (N=366) of the articles and its medical meaning infrequently defined (2.7%; N=14 in the USA and 3.6%; N=15 in Canada). The neurological criterion for determination of death was mentioned in less than 10% of the articles, and life support in about 20% of the articles. Organ donation issues related to DNC were raised more often in Canadian articles than in American articles (33.5% vs 21.2%; p<0.0001). Interpretation Further discussion is needed to develop innovative strategies to bridge media representations of DNC with experts' views in connection with organ donation practices.

In the adult central nervous system, an impressive degree of plasticity is retained through morphological and molecular rearrangements in the pre- and post-synaptic compartments that underlie the strengthening or weakening of synaptic pathways. Plasticity is regulated by the interplay of permissive and inhibitory extracellular cues, which signal through receptors at the synapse to regulate the closure of critical periods of developmental plasticity as well as by acute changes in plasticity in response to experience and activity in the adult. The molecular underpinnings of synaptic plasticity are actively studied and it is clear that the cytoskeleton is a key substrate for many cues that affect plasticity. Many of the cues that restrict synaptic plasticity exhibit residual activity in the injured adult CNS and restrict regenerative growth by targeting the cytoskeleton. Here, we review some of the latest insights into how cytoskeletal remodeling affects neuronal plasticity and discuss how the cytoskeleton is being targeted in an effort to promote plasticity and repair following traumatic injury in the central nervous system.

This skill, which emerges relatively early in development, is driven by increasing connectivity among regions of a distributed sociocognitive neural network and may be vulnerable to disruption from early-childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study aimed to evaluate the very-long-term effect of childhood TBI on EP, as well as examine the contribution of injury- and non-injury-related risk and resilience factors to variability in sociocognitive outcomes. Thirty-four young adult survivors of early-childhood TBI (mean [M], 20.62 years; M time since injury, 16.55 years) and 16 typically developing controls matched for age, gender, and socioeconomic status were assessed using tasks that required recognition and interpretation of facial and prosodic emotional cues. Survivors of severe childhood TBI were found to have significantly poorer emotion perception than controls and young adults with mild-to-moderate injuries. Further, poorer emotion perception was associated with reduced volume of the posterior corpus callosum, presence of frontal pathology, lower SES, and a less-intimate family environment. Our findings lend support to the vulnerability of the immature "social brain" network to early disruption and underscore the need for context-sensitive rehabilitation that optimizes early family environments to enhance recovery of EP skills after childhood TBI.

J	Joyal, CC; Beaulieu-Plante, J; de Chanterac, A				Joyal, Christian C.; Beaulieu-Plante, Jolyane; de Chanterac, Antoine			The Neuropsychology of Sex Offenders: A Meta-Analysis	SEXUAL ABUSE-A JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND TREATMENT			English	Article						neuropsychology; cognition; sexual deviance; sex offenders; pedophiles	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; CHILD MOLESTERS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; SOCIAL-SKILLS; MMPI PROFILES; PEDOPHILIA; RAPISTS; BEHAVIOR; INTELLIGENCE; MEN	Typically, neuropsychological studies of sex offenders have grouped together different types of individuals and different types of measures. This is why results have tended to be nonspecific and divergent across studies. Against this background, the authors undertook a review of the literature regarding the neuropsychology of sex offenders, taking into account subgroups based on criminological theories. They also conducted a meta-analysis of the data to demonstrate the cognitive heterogeneity of sex offenders statistically. Their main objective was to test the hypothesis to the effect that the neuropsychological deficits of sex offenders are not broad and generalized compared with specific subgroups of participants based on specific measures. In all, 23 neuropsychological studies reporting data on 1,756 participants were taken into consideration. As expected, a highly significant, broad, and heterogeneous overall effect size was found. Taking subgroups of participants and specific cognitive measures into account significantly improved homogeneity. Sex offenders against children tended to obtain lower scores than did sex offenders against adults on higher order executive functions, whereas sex offenders against adults tended to obtain results similar to those of non-sex offenders, with lower scores in verbal fluency and inhibition. However, it is concluded that neuropsychological data on sex offenders are still too scarce to confirm these trends or to test more precise hypotheses. For greater clinical relevance, future neuropsychological studies should consider specific subgroups of participants and measures to verify the presence of different cognitive profiles.

Despite the identification of 20 SCA genes, the cause of the disorder in a significant proportion of families with SCA remains unexplained. In 1972, a French-Canadian family segregating a combination of SCA and erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV) in an autosomal dominant fashion was described. OBJECTIVE To map and identify the causative gene in this large family with SCA and EKV using a combination of linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 32 individuals from the family have undergone complete neurologic and dermatologic examinations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mutations in ELOVL4 have been reported in families with macular degeneration. Recently, homozygous mutations were found in patients with ichthyosis, spastic paraplegia, and severe neurodevelopmental defects. In the present study, we report on a heterozygote mutation in ELOVL4 in affected individuals from the family with SCA and EKV. The mutation segregates with a milder phenotype consisting of early-onset patches of erythema and hyperkeratosis, as well as SCA manifesting in the fourth or fifth decade of life. RESULTS We describe the mapping and the identification of a c.504G>C transversion in ELOVL4 resulting in the p.L168F substitution. We also provide clinical characterization of the phenotypes in 19 mutation carriers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We report, to our knowledge, the first mutation in ELOVL4 that is associated with SCA and EKV. This gene encodes a member of the elongase family, which is responsible for the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (at least 26 carbons). These fatty acids participate in a wide variety of physiological functions, including skin barrier formation and peroxisome P-oxidation. Overall, these results provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of these complex neurodegenerative disorders.

The patients reported so far have posterior lesions encompassing either or both the right inferior occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, and exhibit a critical impairment in generating a sufficiently detailed holistic percept to individualize faces. Here, we extended these observations to include the prosopagnosic patient LR (Bukach, Bub, Gauthier, & Tarr, 2006), whose damage is restricted to the anterior region of the right temporal lobe. First we report that LR is able to discriminate parametrically defined individual exemplars of nonface object categories as accurately and quickly as typical observers, which suggests that the visual similarity account of prosopagnosia does not explain his impairments. Then, we show that LR does not present with the typical face inversion effect, whole-part advantage, or composite face effect and, therefore, has impaired holistic perception of individual faces. Moreover, the patient is more impaired at matching faces when the facial part he fixates is masked than when it is selectively revealed by means of gaze contingency. Altogether these observations support the view that the nature of the critical face impairment does not differ qualitatively across patients with acquired prosopagnosia, regardless of the localization of brain damage: all these patients appear to be impaired to some extent at what constitutes the heart of our visual expertise With faces, namely holistic perception at a sufficiently fine-grained level of resolution to discriminate exemplars of the face class efficiently. This conclusion raises issues regarding the existing criteria for diagnosis/classification of patients as cases of apperceptive or associative prosopagnosia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The importance of vision is strongly embedded in the organization of the primate brain as about one third of its cortical surface is involved in visual functions. It is therefore not surprising that the absence of vision from birth, or the loss of vision later in life, has huge consequences, both anatomically and functionally. Studies in animals and humans, conducted over the past few decades, have demonstrated that the absence of vision causes massive structural changes that take place not only in the visually deprived cortex but also in other brain areas. These studies have further shown that the visually deprived cortex becomes responsive to a wide variety of non-visual sensory inputs. Recent studies even showed a role of the visually deprived cortex in cognitive processes. At the behavioral level, increases in acuity for auditory and tactile processes have been reported. The study of the congenitally blind brain also offers a unique model to gain better insights into the functioning of the normal sighted brain and to understand to what extent visual experience is necessary for the brain to develop its functional architecture. Finally, the study of the blind brain allows us to investigate how consciousness develops in the absence of vision. How does the brain of someone who has never had any visual perception form an image of the external world? In this paper, we discuss recent findings from animal studies as well as from behavioural and functional brain imaging studies in sighted and blind individuals that address these questions.

Their proper targeting to the plasma membrane (PM) is required for function. We created discrete deletions at the amino and carboxy termini of Vangl1 and monitored the effect of the mutations on PM targeting in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Our results show that the Vangl1 amino terminus lacks PM targeting determinants, and these are restricted to the carboxy terminus, including the predicted PDZBM motif at the C-terminus.

Since Ehd3 is most abundantly expressed in brain tissues, we examined its role in brain cancer progression. Using immunohistochemistry, we report loss of EHD3 expression in gliomas, including low-grade astrocytomas, suggesting that this is an early event in gliomagenesis. EHD3 expression is also very low in most of glioma cell lines tested. In two cell lines, a bisulfite sequencing method identifies promoter hypermethylation as a mechanism of Ehd3 silencing, and its expression was restored by the demethylating agent 5-Azacytidine. Doxycycline-inducible restoration of EHD3 expression to glioma cells decreases their growth and invasiveness and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated Ehd3 silencing increases cell growth. Using a xenograft model, we demonstrate Ehd3 growth inhibitory functions in glioma cells in vivo. We suggest that Ehd3 functions as a tumor suppressor gene and loss of its expression is a very common event in gliomas. This is the first study to highlight the importance of a member of the C-terminal EHD proteins in cancer and to link their functions to the cell cycle and apoptosis.EHD3 is a protein residing in endocytic tubular and vesicular membrane structures. We report that EHD3 is lost in gliomas and is a tumor suppressor with functions in the cell cycle and apoptosis.

In this review, we summarize key preclinical and clinical data relating to the proposed mechanism of action of the recently approved DMT teriflunomide in MS. Teriflunomide selectively and reversibly inhibits dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase, a key mitochondrial enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, leading to a reduction in proliferation of activated T and B lymphocytes without causing cell death. Results from animal experiments modelling the immune activation implicated in MS demonstrate reductions in disease symptoms with teriflunomide treatment, accompanied by reduced central nervous system lymphocyte infiltration, reduced axonal loss, and preserved neurological functioning. In agreement with the results obtained in these model systems, phase 3 clinical trials of teriflunomide in patients with MS have consistently shown that teriflunomide provides a therapeutic benefit, and importantly, does not cause clinical immune suppression. Taken together, these data demonstrate how teriflunomide acts as a selective immune therapy for patients with MS.

Early Musical Training Is Linked to Gray Matter Structure in the Ventral Premotor Cortex and Auditory-Motor Rhythm Synchronization Performance	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTICAL SURFACE; SENSITIVE PERIOD; GEOMETRICALLY ACCURATE; COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION; COORDINATE SYSTEM; PLASTICITY	Evidence in animals and humans indicates that there are sensitive periods during development, times when experience or stimulation has a greater influence on behavior and brain structure. Sensitive periods are the result of an interaction between maturational processes and experience-dependent plasticity mechanisms. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that adult musicians who begin training before the age of 7 show enhancements in behavior and white matter structure compared with those who begin later. Plastic changes in white matter and gray matter are hypothesized to co-occur; therefore, the current study investigated possible differences in gray matter structure between early-trained (ET; <7) and late-trained (LT; >7) musicians, matched for years of experience. Gray matter structure was assessed using voxel-wise analysis techniques (optimized voxel-based morphometry, traditional voxel-based morphometry, and deformation-based morphometry) and surface-based measures (cortical thickness, surface area and mean curvature). Deformation-based morphometry analyses identified group differences between ET and LT musicians in right ventral premotor cortex (vPMC), which correlated with performance on an auditory motor synchronization task and with age of onset of musical training. In addition, cortical surface area in vPMC was greater for ET musicians. These results are consistent with evidence that premotor cortex shows greatest maturational change between the ages of 6-9 years and that this region is important for integrating auditory and motor information. We propose that the auditory and motor interactions required by musical practice drive plasticity in vPMC and that this plasticity is greatest when maturation is near its peak.

In the mature muscle, the relative levels of physical activity are the major determinants of NMJ function. Classically, motor neuron-mediated activation patterns of skeletal muscle have been thought of as the major drivers of NMJ plasticity and the ensuing fibre-type determination in muscle. Here we use muscle-specific transgenic animals for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) as a genetic model for trained mice to elucidate the contribution of skeletal muscle to activity-induced adaptation of the NMJ. We find that muscle-specific expression of PGC-1 alpha promotes a remodelling of the NMJ, even in the absence of increased physical activity. Importantly, these plastic changes are not restricted to post-synaptic structures, but extended to modulation of presynaptic cell morphology and function. Therefore, our data indicate that skeletal muscle significantly contributes to the adaptation of the NMJ subsequent to physical activity.

In Vitro Membrane Permeation Studies and in Vivo Antinociception of Glycosylated Dmt(1)-DALDA Analogues	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Opioid peptides; glycosylation; in vivo antinociception; Dmt(1)-DALDA	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; ENKEPHALIN ANALOGS; OPIOID ACTIVITY; BIOAVAILABILITY; PERMEABILITY; TRANSPORT; MANNITOL; MODEL	In this study the mu opioid receptor (MOR) ligands DALDA (Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2) and Dmt(1)-DALDA (Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2, Dmt = 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine) were glycosylated at the N- or C-terminus. Subsequently, the modified peptides were subjected to in vitro and in vivo evaluation. In contrast to the N-terminally modified peptide (3), all peptide analogues derivatized at the C-terminus (4-7) proved to possess high affinity and agonist potency at both MOR and DOR (delta opioid receptor). Results of the Caco-2 monolayer permeation, as well as in vitro blood-brain barrier model experiments, showed that, in the case of compound 4, the glycosylation only slightly diminished the lumen-to-blood and blood-to-lumen transport. Altogether, these experiments were indicative of transcellular transport but not active transport. In vivo assays demonstrated that the peptides were capable of (i) crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and (ii) activating both the spinal ascending as well as the descending opioid pathways, as determined by the tail-flick and hot-plate assays, respectively. In contrast to the highly selective MOR agonist Dmt(1)-DALDA 1, compounds 4-7 are mixed MOR/DOR agonists, expected to produce reduced opioid-related side effects.

Several compounds showed significantly increased mu agonist potency, retained mu receptor selectivity and are of interest as drug candidates for neuropathic pain treatment. Surprisingly, the Dmp(3)-, Imp(3)-, Emp(3)- and 1-Nal(3)-containing analogues showed much increased kappa receptor binding affinity and had mixed mu/kappa properties. In these cases, molecular dynamics studies indicated conformational preorganization of the unbound peptide ligands due to rotational restriction around the C-beta-C-gamma bond of the Xxx(3) residue, in correlation with the observed kappa receptor binding enhancement. Compounds with a mixed mu/kappa opioid activity profile are known to have therapeutic potential for treatment of cocaine abuse. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Age of language learning shapes brain structure: A cortical thickness study of bilingual and monolingual individuals	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Anatomical brain imaging; Cortical thickness; Bilingualism; Second-language acquisition; Brain plasticity; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)	AUTOMATED 3-D EXTRACTION; MRI; REGISTRATION; ACQUISITION; PLASTICITY; SURFACES; INNER	We examined the effects of learning a second language (L2) on brain structure. Cortical thickness was measured in the MRI datasets of 22 monolinguals and 66 bilinguals. Some bilingual subjects had learned both languages simultaneously (0-3 years) while some had learned their L2 after achieving proficiency in their first language during either early (4-7 years) or late childhood (8-13 years). Later acquisition of L2 was associated with significantly thicker cortex in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and thinner cortex in the right IFG. These effects were seen in the group comparisons of monolinguals, simultaneous bilinguals and early and late bilinguals. Within the bilingual group, significant correlations between age of acquisition of L2 and cortical thickness were seen in the same regions: cortical thickness correlated with age of acquisition positively in the left IFG and negatively in the right IFG. Interestingly, the monolinguals and simultaneous bilinguals did not differ in cortical thickness in any region. Our results show that learning a second language after gaining proficiency in the first language modifies brain structure in an age-dependent manner whereas simultaneous acquisition of two languages has no additional effect on brain development.

The homologues of these areas in the macaque monkey brain have been established by direct cytoarchitectonic comparison with the human brain. The cortical areas that project monosynaptically to areas 44 and 45B in the macaque monkey brain require clarification. Fluorescent retrograde tracers were placed in cytoarchitectonic areas 44 and 45B of the macaque monkey, as well as in the anterior part of the inferior parietal lobule and the superior temporal gyrus. The results demonstrate that ipsilateral afferent connections of area 44 arise from local frontal areas, including rostral premotor cortical area 6, from secondary somatosensory cortex, the caudal insula, and the cingulate motor region. Area 44 is strongly linked with the anterior inferior parietal lobule (particularly area PFG and the adjacent anterior intraparietal sulcus). Input from the temporal lobe is limited to the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus extending caudal to the central sulcus. There is also input from the sulcal part of area Tpt in the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Area 45B shares some of the connections of area 44, but can be distinguished from area 44 by input from the caudal inferior parietal lobule (area PG) and significant input from the part of the superior temporal sulcus that extends anterior to the central sulcus. Area 45B also receives input from visual association cortex that is not observed in area 44. The results have provided a clarification of the relative connections of areas 44 and 45B of the ventrolateral frontal region which, in the human brain, subserves certain aspects of language processing.

The role of these areas in the right hemisphere in language processing is not understood and, although there is evidence from lesion studies that the right hemisphere is involved in the appreciation of semantic relations, no specific anatomical substrate has yet been identified. This event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared brain activity during the performance of language processing trials in which either dominant or subordinate meaning activation of ambiguous words was required. The results show that the ventral part of the pars opercularis both in the left and the right hemisphere is centrally involved in language processing. In addition, they highlight the bilateral co-activation of this region with the supramarginal gyrus of the inferior parietal lobule during the processing of this type of linguistic material. This study, thus, provides the first evidence of co-activation of Broca's region and the inferior parietal lobule, succeeding in further specifying the relative contribution of these cortical areas to language processing.

However, the sensitivity of the technique is highly dependent on methodological details. Acquisition parameters, pre-processing steps, reconstruction models, and statistical analysis all affect the final sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of a study. In the case of fiber pathway reconstruction in the central nervous system, termed tractography, false positive and false negative results abound, and interpretation of results must take into account the potential shortcomings of the techniques used. This article will review the strengths and limitations of different types of diffusion MRI tractography analysis, and highlight what one can realistically hope to learn from such imaging studies of the human brain.

Weakly electric fish display behavioral responses to envelopes naturally occurring during movement: implications for neural processing	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Envelope; Weakly electric fish; Neural coding; Natural stimulus; Statistics	ORGAN DISCHARGE FREQUENCY; BROWN GHOST KNIFEFISH; APTERONOTUS-LEPTORHYNCHUS; ELECTROCOMMUNICATION SIGNALS; ADAPTATION; STATISTICS; NEURONS; SEX; MODULATIONS; PERCEPTION	How the brain processes natural sensory input remains an important and poorly understood problem in neuroscience. The efficient coding hypothesis asserts that the brain's coding strategies are adapted to the statistics of natural stimuli in order to efficiently process them, thereby optimizing their perception by the organism. Here we examined whether gymnotiform weakly electric fish displayed behavioral responses that are adapted to the statistics of the natural electrosensory envelopes. Previous studies have shown that the envelopes resulting from movement tend to consist of low (< 1 Hz) temporal frequencies and are behaviorally relevant whereas those resulting from social interactions consist of higher (> 1 Hz) temporal frequencies that can thus mask more behaviorally relevant signals. We found that the self-generated electric organ discharge frequency follows the detailed time course of the envelope around a mean value that is positively offset with respect to its baseline value for temporal frequencies between 0.001 Hz and 1 Hz. The frequency-following component of this behavioral response decreased in magnitude as a power law as a function of the envelope frequency and was negligible for envelope frequencies above 1 Hz. In contrast, the offset component was relatively constant and somewhat increased for envelope frequencies above 1 Hz. Thus, our results show that weakly electric fish display behavioral responses that track the detailed time course of low but not high frequency envelope stimuli. Furthermore, we found that the magnitude of the frequency-following behavioral response matches, in a one-to-one fashion, the spectral power of natural second-order stimulus attributes observed during movement. Indeed, both decayed as a power law with the same exponent for temporal frequencies spanning three orders of magnitude. Thus, our findings suggest that the neural coding strategies used by weakly electric fish perceive the detailed time course of movement envelopes and are adapted to their statistics as found in the natural environment. They also suggest that weakly electric fish might take advantage of the differential frequency content of movement and social envelopes in order to give appropriate behavioral responses during encounters between two or more conspecifics.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2(VEGFR-2) are believed to mediate angiogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Ramucirumab (RAM; IMC-1121B) is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF ligand binding to VEGFR-2, inhibiting VEGFR-2 activation and signaling. Methods. Patients with metastatic CRC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, and adequate organ function who had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease received RAM and the modified FOLFOX-6 regimen every 2 weeks. Endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, overall survival, and safety. The sample size was based on a potentially improved median PFS from 8 months to 11 months. Results. Forty-eight patients received therapy. Median PFS was 11.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.6-13.1 months). The objective response rate was 58.3% (95% CI: 43.21-72.39). The disease control rate (complete or partial response plus stable disease) was 93.8% (95% CI: 82.8-98.7). Median overall survival was 20.4 months (95% CI: 18.5-25.1 months). The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events included neutropenia (grade 3: 33.3%; grade 4: 8.3%), hypertension (grade 3: 16.7%), and neuropathy (grade 3: 12.5%). Two patients died during the study due to myocardial infarction and cardiopulmonary arrest. Conclusion. RAM may enhance the efficacy of modified FOLFOX-6 chemotherapy with an acceptable safety profile in metastatic CRC.

We have shown that chronic administration of morphine (20 mu g) upregulates AM activity contributing to morphine tolerance. The present study investigated if AM is involved in acute morphine-induced analgesia. Single intrathecal (i.t.) injection of morphine at a dose of 5 mu g increased the tail-flick latency (TFL). This analgesic effect was potentiated by the co-administration of the AM receptor antagonist AM(22-52) (5 and 10 nmol). Exposure of sensory ganglion culture to morphine increased AM content in the ganglia in concentration (0.33-10 mu M)- and time (10-240 min)-dependent manners. However, treatment with morphine (3.3 mu M) for 30-240 min did not alter AM mRNA levels in the cultured ganglia. Furthermore, exposure of ganglion cultures to morphine (3.3 mu M) for 30-240, but not 10 min induced an increase in AM content in the culture medium. These results reveal that a single morphine treatment potentiates post-translational change and the release of AM in sensory ganglia masking morphine-induced analgesia. Thus, targeting AM and its receptors should be considered as a novel approach to improve the analgesic potency of opiates during their acute use. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To better understand the mechanisms of this deficiency, the perception of locomotor symmetry was investigated in healthy elderly individuals. 16 participants (6 women, 10 men; M age=70.9 yr., SD=4.1) walked on a split-belt treadmill either at a self-selected or imposed gait speed. The speed of the two belts was initially similar (or different) and then gradually differed (or matched), so participants had to detect the point of perceived asymmetry (or symmetry). The results revealed that thresholds occurred when the belt speed ratios were .88 and .85. Initial gait speed did not affect the threshold. The parameter that correlated the most with belt speed asymmetry was stance time of the parameters measured. Future studies will investigate whether stroke affects gait symmetry judgments.

Although plasma transfusion is common in intensive care, there are no data on plasma transfusion practices in pediatric critical care units. Study Design and MethodsA scenario-based survey was sent to 718 pediatric critical care physicians working in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Respondents were asked to report their decisions regarding plasma transfusion practice with respect to four scenarios: pneumonia, septic shock, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and postoperative care after a Tetralogy of Fallot correction. ResultsThe response rate was 187 of 718 (26%); half of the responders worked in North America. The proportion of physicians who transfused plasma to nonbleeding patients, solely based on abnormal international normalized ratio (INR), varied from 66% for pneumonia to 84% for TBI (p<0.001). In such nonbleeding patients, the median INR threshold that would trigger plasma transfusion was 2.5 for pneumonia and septic shock patients and 2.0 for TBI and the cardiac postoperative patients (p<0.001). Minor bleeding, minor surgery, insertion of a femoral line, hypotension, abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombocytopenia, and anemia levels were important determinants of plasma transfusion, whereas none of the respondents' demographic characteristics were important. ConclusionMore than two-thirds of responding pediatric critical care physicians prescribe plasma transfusions for nonbleeding critically ill children. Additionally, there is a significant variation in transfusion practice patterns with respect to plasma transfusion thresholds.

It plays an important role in synaptic transmission and plasticity and has also been linked to several pathological diseases such as schizophrenia and Huntington's. The quantification of local changes in D-serine concentration is essential to further understanding these processes. We report herein the development of a disk-shaped amperometric enzymatic biosensor for detection of D-serine based on a 25 mu m diameter platinum disk microelectrode with an electrodeposited poly-m-phenylenediamine (PPD) layer and an R. gracilis D-amino acid oxidase (RgDAAO) layer. The disk-shaped D-serine biosensor is 1 S orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported probes and exhibits a sensitivity of 276 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) with an in vitro detection limit of 0.6 mu M. We demonstrate its usefulness for in vivo applications by measuring the release of endogenous D-serine in the brain of Xenopus laevis tadpoles.

It is well known that the constraints of this kind of system consist of kinematic constraints for the mobile platform and dynamic constraints for the under-actuated manipulator with a passive joint. Through using dynamic coupling property of nonholonomic mobile manipulators, we can decouple the dynamics into a fully actuated subsystem and an unactuated subsystem. Then adaptive control is employed for the fully actuated subsystem using fuzzy logic approximation. Since the non-actuated subsystem cannot be directly manipulated by torque inputs but can be indirectly affected by the motion of the actuated subsystem, the reference trajectory of the actuated subsystem is planned by the fuzzy logic system based motion generator. Rigorous theoretic analysis has been established to show that the proposed trajectory generation and control are able to achieve dynamic stability, motion tracking and optimized dynamics. Simulation studies have further validated the efficiency of the developed scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Scyl1 scaffolds class II Arfs to specific subcomplexes of coatomer through the gamma-COP appendage domain	JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE			English	Article						Coatomer; Arf4; Scyl1; gamma-COP; ERGIC-53; Tubulation; Early secretory pathway	ADP-RIBOSYLATION FACTOR; GOLGI INTERMEDIATE COMPARTMENT; NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTORS; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; SPINOCEREBELLAR NEURODEGENERATION; TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEINS; VESICLE FORMATION; COATED VESICLES; RECESSIVE FORM; FACTOR GBF1	Coatomer (COPI)-coated vesicles mediate membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway. There are at least three subclasses of COPI coats and two classes of Arf GTPases that couple COPI coat proteins to membranes. Whether mechanisms exist to link specific Arfs to specific COPI subcomplexes is unknown. We now demonstrate that Scy1-like protein 1 (Scyl1), a member of the Scy1-like family of catalytically inactive protein kinases, oligomerizes through centrally located HEAT repeats and uses a C-terminal RKXX-COO- motif to interact directly with the appendage domain of coatomer subunit gamma-2 (also known as COPG2 or gamma 2-COP). Through a distinct site, Scyl1 interacts selectively with class II Arfs, notably Arf4, thus linking class II Arfs to gamma 2-bearing COPI subcomplexes. Therefore, Scyl1 functions as a scaffold for key components of COPI coats, and disruption of the scaffolding function of Scyl1 causes tubulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis-Golgi, similar to that observed following the loss of Arf and Arf-guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) function. Our data reveal that Scyl1 is a key organizer of a subset of the COPI machinery.	[Hamlin, Jason N.

Ependymoma in children under the age of 3 years: a report from the Canadian Pediatric Brain Tumour Consortium	JOURNAL OF NEURO-ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Ependymoma; Infants; Therapy; Less than 3 years of age	POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY; INTRACRANIAL EPENDYMOMAS; DEFERRED RADIOTHERAPY; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; CANCER GROUP; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CHILDHOOD; ONCOLOGY; INFANTS	The determination of optimal therapy for ependymoma (EP) in infants is ongoing. We describe the incidence, management and outcomes of Canadian infants with EP to discern potential future research questions. Of 579 cases registered in a national database of children < 36 months of age diagnosed with a brain tumor from 1990 to 2005, inclusive, 75 (13 %) were EP. These cases were analyzed. A mean annual age-adjusted incidence rate of 4.6 per 100,000 children years was calculated. The male:female ratio was 1.77. Of the tumors, 80 % were infratentorial in location, 67 % were WHO grade II histology, and 29 % were metastatic at diagnosis. All patients underwent a surgical procedure. A complete resection of the tumor was achieved in 56 % of the cases; 43 % of these patients survive while 36 % of the patients with tumors less than completely resected survive. Initial therapy consisted of surgery alone in 23 % of patients, or surgery plus chemotherapy (37 %), radiation therapy (RT; 19 %), or both (21 %). Any use of RT increased with patient age. The 5-year EFS rates for patients in each of the four treatment groups was 22, 11.5, 46.2 and 64.8 %, respectively. For all patients the median survival was 63 +/- A 6 months and 5-year overall survival was 55 +/- A 6 %. Patients treated with surgery and chemotherapy alone were younger and had a lower rate of survival than older patients who were more often treated with radiation therapy containing regimens. Further study is needed to determine which patients are optimally served with these treatment modalities.
